  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to concurrently evaluate whether adjunct treatment with&#xD;
      corticosteroids in children hospitalized with CAP is more effective in terms of the&#xD;
      proportion of children reaching clinical stability and whether such adjunct treatment is no&#xD;
      worse in terms of CAP relapse.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The incidence of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) in young children remains high (20-&#xD;
      30/1000 child-years) even in high-income settings with routine pneumococcal vaccination, and&#xD;
      is associated with a high rate of hospitalisation (around 10/1000 child-years). In low-and&#xD;
      middle-income settings, pneumonia is the leading infectious cause of death in children less&#xD;
      than 5 years of age. In high-income settings, working mothers of children hospitalised with&#xD;
      CAP have been reported to loose on average 4.2 workdays compared with 1.7 workdays for&#xD;
      children with CAP managed in primary care. In addition to this economic burden, there is a&#xD;
      substantial impact on quality of life for the affected child and the family. Children who are&#xD;
      admitted with CAP experience on average 13 nonroutine days with slightly shorter periods of&#xD;
      decreased appetite (8.5 days), disordered sleep (4.5 days) and absence from routine&#xD;
      out-of-home childcare (7.5 days). Any intervention that ensures rapid clinical stabilization&#xD;
      allowing for early hospital discharge without negative impacts on the overall recovery in&#xD;
      children hospitalised with CAP would therefore carry substantial socioeconomic benefits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Only few small trials have addressed the potential impact of oral steroid treatment in CAP&#xD;
      during childhood. Nagy et al reported a significant reduction in fever duration and length of&#xD;
      stay in children with severe CAP receiving methylprednisolone for 5 days compared with&#xD;
      children receiving placebo in a randomised trial with 59 participants. A randomised trial&#xD;
      comparing adjunct dexamethasone or methylprednisolone against standard of care (no placebo)&#xD;
      planning to enroll 40 participants was being set up but has been withdrawn prior to&#xD;
      recruitment (NCT01631916). A placebo-controlled randomised trial of adjunct corticosteroids&#xD;
      in CAP complicated by pleural effusion and/or empyema with 56 participants has been completed&#xD;
      (NCT01261546), but has not yet reported on its findings. An observational analysis using&#xD;
      propensity scores found that adjunct corticosteroids were associated with a shorter hospital&#xD;
      stay only in children also receiving beta-agonist therapy, concluding that any benefit might&#xD;
      only be seen in children with acute wheezing. All in all, there is a lack of pragmatic&#xD;
      randomized controlled trials ( RCT) with sufficient power and high external validity to&#xD;
      provide a definitive answer to the question of the effect of adjunct steroids in children&#xD;
      hospitalised with CAP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Infection-related unwanted effects of adjunct steroids are potentially relevant in the&#xD;
      context of childhood CAP. A higher proportion of children hospitalised with CAP reaching&#xD;
      early clinical stability would only be desirable if this were shown not to be offset by a&#xD;
      higher rate of clinically relevant CAP recurrence. A rebound phenomenon after corticosteroid&#xD;
      discontinuation has been postulated to explain a higher rate of infection recurrence (19%&#xD;
      compared with 9% in placebo group) among adults. Data from a recent individual patient data&#xD;
      metaanalysis, however, indicate that an increased risk of CAP recurrence may be rather&#xD;
      associated with longer duration of adjunct steroids in adults with CAP. To our knowledge, the&#xD;
      question about the effect of adjunct steroid treatment in childhood CAP in relation to a&#xD;
      postulated rebound phenomenon measured clinically as CAP recurrence has not been formally&#xD;
      addressed in a trial. CAP-specific readmission rates for children are low at around 5%. In&#xD;
      bronchiolitis, another acute lower respiratory tract infection for which oral corticosteroid&#xD;
      treatment has been investigated, an increased risk of hospital revisits associated with&#xD;
      steroid treatment could not be identified in a Cochrane metaanalysis.&#xD;
