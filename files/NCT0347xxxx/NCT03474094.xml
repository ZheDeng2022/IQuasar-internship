    <textblock>
      This multicentric, randomised, Phase II trial will use a pick-the-winner design in order to&#xD;
      evaluate the clinical and biological activity of atezolizumab when combined with&#xD;
      pre-operative or post-operative radiotherapy in STS patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following Inform Consent Form (ICF) signature, eligible patients will be randomised (1:1:1)&#xD;
      to receive:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Arm A: Radiotherapy followed by atezolizumab then surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Arm B: Atezolizumab followed by surgery then radiotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Arm C: Radiotherapy then surgery followed by atezolizumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sequence of the study treatments is different among the 3 study arms. However, the dose&#xD;
      regimens will be the same:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Atezolizumab will be administered to all patients at the dose of 1200mg, by IV&#xD;
           injection, for 2 cycles (Q3W).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Radiotherapy will be administered to all patients at the dose of 2Gy/day, 5 days per&#xD;
           week, for a total of 5 weeks and 50Gy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Surgery will be performed as per institutional practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomisation will be stratified according to histological subtypes as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 1: Liposarcoma (LPS), Undifferentiated Pleomorphic Sarcoma (UPS), Leiomyosarcoma (LMS),&#xD;
      myxofibrosarcoma, angiosarcoma versus Group 2: all translocation sarcoma except Ewing,&#xD;
      rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) and myxoid LPS.&#xD;

      This trial is a European, multicenter, open-label, randomized, Phase II trial using a&#xD;
      pick-the-winner design aiming to the clinical and biological activity of anti-PD-L1&#xD;
      (atezolizumab) in a population of operable localised soft tissue sarcomas (STS) patients to&#xD;
      be treated with radiotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following inform consent signature and validation of eligibility criteria, patients will be&#xD;
      randomized (1:1:1) into one of the 3 study arms:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Arm A: Pre-operative radiotherapy followed by 2 cycles of atezolizumab then surgery&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Arm B: 2 cycles of atezolizumab followed by surgery then post-operative radiotherapy&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Arm C: Pre-operative radiotherapy followed by surgery then 2 cycles of atezolizumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sequence of treatment is different between the study arms, but the regimen of study&#xD;
      treatments are the same. All randomized patients will received:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The conventionally fractionated radiotherapy regimen of 2 Gy, 5 days a week up to a&#xD;
           total dose of 50 Gy over 5 weeks. Radiotherapy will be either pre-(Arms A and C) or&#xD;
           post-(Arm B) operative.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Two cycles of atezolizumab (1200mg, IV, Q3W)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Surgery will be performed as per institutional practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomisation will be stratified according to histological subtypes as follows&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group 1: Leiomyosarcoma [LMS], Undifferentiated Pleomorphic Sarcoma [UPS], Liposarcoma&#xD;
           [LPS], myxofibrosarcoma, angiosarcoma versus&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group 2: all translocation sarcoma except Ewing, rhabdomyosarcoma RMS and myxoid LPS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following this sequence of treatment, all patients will be followed-up 2 weeks after the end&#xD;
      of the treatment period then W18, W24 (=M6) then every 3 months until disease relapse, death,&#xD;
      loss to follow-up. The minimal follow-up will be 1 year for the last randomized patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the study period, the following tumor samples will be also collected for all&#xD;
      randomized patients:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A de novo tumor biopsy before study treatment start (pre-treatment tumor sample)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A fragment of the surgery specimen.&#xD;

                  other immunostimulatory agents for 10 weeks after the last dose of atezolizumab,&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Immunosuppressive medications, including but not limited to cyclophosphamide,&#xD;
                  azathioprine, methotrexate, and thalidomide. These agents could potentially alter&#xD;
                  the activity and the safety of atezolizumab. Systemic corticosteroids and&#xD;
                  anti-TNF-α agents may attenuate potential beneficial immunologic effects of&#xD;
                  treatment with atezolizumab but may be administered to manage irAE (See Safety&#xD;
                  Plan). If feasible, alternatives to these agents should be considered.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Patients with a malignancy other than STS within 5 years prior to randomisation with&#xD;
             the exception of those with a negligible risk of metastasis or death and treated with&#xD;
             expected curative outcome (such as adequately treated in situ carcinoma of the cervix,&#xD;
             basal or squamous cell skin cancer, localised prostate cancer or ductal in situ&#xD;
             carcinoma treated surgically with curative intent).&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Patients with severe infections within 4 weeks prior to randomisation including but&#xD;
             not limited to hospitalization for complications of infection, bacteraemia, or severe&#xD;
             pneumonia.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Patients with history of autoimmune disease including but not limited to myasthenia&#xD;
             gravis, myositis, autoimmune hepatitis, systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid&#xD;
             arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease, vascular thrombosis associated with&#xD;
             antiphospholipid syndrome, Wegener's granulomatosis, Sjögren's syndrome,&#xD;
             Guillain-Barré syndrome, multiple sclerosis, vasculitis, or glomerulonephritis.&#xD;
&#xD;
             Note: Patients with eczema, psoriasis, lichen simplex chronicus, or vitiligo with&#xD;
             dermatologic manifestations only (e.g., patients with psoriatic arthritis would be&#xD;
             excluded) are permitted provided that they meet the following conditions:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Rash must cover less than 10% of body surface area (BSA).&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Disease is well controlled at baseline and only requiring low potency topical&#xD;
                  steroids.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  No acute exacerbations of underlying condition within the previous 12 months (not&#xD;
                  requiring PUVA [psoralen plus ultraviolet A radiation], methotrexate, retinoids,&#xD;
                  biologic agents, oral calcineurin inhibitors, high-potency or oral steroids)&quot;&#xD;
                  Note: Patients with a history of autoimmune hypothyroidism on a stable dose of&#xD;
                  thyroid replacement hormone may be eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
             Note: Patients with a type I diabetes well controlled by a stable dose of insulin are&#xD;
             eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Patients with active B or C hepatitis infection. Note: Patients with past Hepatitis B&#xD;
             Virus (HBV) infection or resolved HBV infection (defined as having a negative HBsAg&#xD;
             test and a positive antibody to hepatitis B core antigen [anti-HBc] antibody test) are&#xD;
             eligible. Patients positive for Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) antibody are eligible only if&#xD;
             polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is negative for HCV RNA.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Patients with active tuberculosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Patients with ongoing toxicities (Grade ≥1 according to CTCAE V5.0) from previous&#xD;
             therapies, except for alopecia (any grades) and lab values defined in inclusion&#xD;
             criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
             Note: Some Grade 2 may be permitted following discussion with the Sponsor.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Patients with evidence of significant uncontrolled concomitant disease that could&#xD;
             affect compliance with the protocol or interpretation of results, including&#xD;
             significant liver disease (such as cirrhosis, uncontrolled major seizure disorder, or&#xD;
             superior vena cava syndrome).&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Patients with significant cardiovascular disease, such as New York Heart Association&#xD;
             cardiac disease Class II or greater, myocardial infarction within 3 months prior to&#xD;
             W1D1, unstable arrhythmias or unstable angina.&#xD;
&#xD;
             Notes:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Patients with a known Left Ventricular Ejection Fraction (LVEF) &lt; 40% will be&#xD;
                  excluded&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Patients with known coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure not meeting&#xD;
                  the above criteria, or LVEF &lt; 50% must be on a stable medical regimen that is&#xD;
                  optimized in the opinion of the treating physician, in consultation with a&#xD;
                  cardiologist if appropriate.&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Patients with history of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (including pneumonitis),&#xD;
             drug-induced pneumonitis, organizing pneumonia (i.e. bronchiolitis obliterans,&#xD;
             cryptogenic organizing pneumonia), or evidence of active pneumonitis on imaging.&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. Pregnant or lactating women.&#xD;
&#xD;
         14. Prior organ transplantation including allogeneic stem cell transplantation.&#xD;
&#xD;
         15. Patients who are known to be serologically positive for human immunodeficiency virus&#xD;
             (HIV).&#xD;
