  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      AGE-ON is a series of workshops developed by the Regional Geriatric Program central, based in&#xD;
      Hamilton, Ontario. The goal of these workshops is to teach older adults with limited computer&#xD;
      knowledge how to use tablet computers to connect with friends and family and gather&#xD;
      information related to issues of importance to them. The overwhelming positive response to&#xD;
      three initial pilots proved the interest in such a program from seniors in the community.&#xD;
      Preliminary feedback from program participants was collected as part of the initial pilot;&#xD;
      the investigators would now like to use this feedback to improve the existing workshops and&#xD;
      expand implementation of the program to a diverse population of older adults. The objective&#xD;
      of this study is to conduct a formal mixed-methods evaluation of the updated AGE-ON workshops&#xD;
      implemented at multiple community-based sites.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Adults over 65 years are the fastest growing segment of Canada's population. Social isolation&#xD;
      (defined as living alone with infrequent social contact and/or few social network ties) and&#xD;
      loneliness (a dissatisfaction with the discrepancy between desired and actual social&#xD;
      connections) are of growing concern, as individuals are living longer and often living alone&#xD;
      or far from family and close friends. Both loneliness and social isolation are related to&#xD;
      poor quality of life and overall well being. The internet and communication technology may be&#xD;
      important tools to help older adults connect with family and friends, thus maintaining or&#xD;
      even enhancing social connections. They help users overcome physical and spatial barriers to&#xD;
      connect with others. However many older adults have obstacles to internet and technology use&#xD;
      such as lack of knowledge and efficacy, and concerns over privacy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AGE-ON is a series of volunteer-run workshops developed in 2014 by the Regional Geriatric&#xD;
      Program in Hamilton. The goal of these workshops is to teach older adults with limited&#xD;
      computer knowledge how to use tablet computers to connect with friends and family and gather&#xD;
      information related to issues of importance to them. Over six weeks, participants learn 1)&#xD;
      basic features of the iPad; 2) how to use the internet; 3) how to take and view photos; 4)&#xD;
      how to send and receive emails; and 5) other 'fun' functions. An initial pilot project&#xD;
      conducted in 2014-2015 displayed an overwhelmingly positive response to the AGE-ON workshops&#xD;
      by both participants and volunteers, generating local media attention and resulting in a&#xD;
      large number of interested older adults being placed on a wait-list for future workshops.&#xD;
      This response proved the interest and need for a program of this type in the community.&#xD;
      Preliminary feedback was gathered from participants; the investigators would now like to use&#xD;
      this feedback to improve and expand upon the existing curriculum, and conduct a formal&#xD;
      evaluation of the workshops.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Through this randomized controlled trial the study team will conduct a formal evaluation of&#xD;
      the AGE-ON workshops. Tablet and internet use and self-efficacy, barriers to technology use,&#xD;
      social isolation, loneliness and quality of life will be assessed before and after the&#xD;
      workshops. Qualitative feedback from participants will be collected after each workshop, and&#xD;
      in-person and telephone interviews will be conducted with participants at the end of the&#xD;
      workshops.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on preliminary findings from AGE-ON Level 1 pilot project, we expect that participants&#xD;
      in the AGE-ON program will improve self-efficacy in using their tablet for variety of tasks,&#xD;
      specifically communicating with family and friends, and accessing health information. We&#xD;
      anticipate this will result in a reduction in social isolation and loneliness, and&#xD;
      improvement in quality of life. We also expect that this benefit will extend beyond the&#xD;
      individual participant themselves, to family members and friends of workshop participants. At&#xD;
      the community-level, this project will establish partnerships between researchers at McMaster&#xD;
      University (Portal team), clinicians (Regional Geriatric Program, central) and organizations&#xD;
      that work with older adults in the community (YWCA, assisted living facilities).&#xD;
