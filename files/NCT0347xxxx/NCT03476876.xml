  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Diabetes-related foot ulcers (DFUs) are a leading cause of hospitalization and amputation&#xD;
      worldwide, and account for 33% of all direct costs of diabetes care in the US. Ulcers&#xD;
      requiring acute care can result in treatment costs of up to US$70,000 per event, varying with&#xD;
      the severity of the wound. Once the skin is ulcerated, it is susceptible to becoming infected&#xD;
      and ultimately amputation in particular in case of deep DFUs. To manage the cost and avoid&#xD;
      hospitalization and amputation, wound should be immediately closed. But this is often&#xD;
      challenging in diabetic foot with deep ulcers.Wound healing is a dynamic process involving&#xD;
      interactions between cells, extracellular matrix (ECM) and growth factors that reconstitutes&#xD;
      tissue following injury. ECM plays an important role in tissue regeneration and is the major&#xD;
      component of the dermal skin layer. Recognition of the importance of the ECM in wound healing&#xD;
      has led to the development of wound products that aim to stimulate or replace the ECM in&#xD;
      particular in case of deep tissue destruction because of deep DFUs. It is known from the&#xD;
      literature that chronic or hard-to-heal wounds are characterized by a disrupted or damaged&#xD;
      ECM that cannot support wound healing. Thus treatment strategies based on use of biologic&#xD;
      scaffold materials for management of chronic and deep wounds has increased dramatically&#xD;
      during the past two decades. These scaffolds include those comprising an intact extracellular&#xD;
      matrix (ECM) or individual components of the ECM, and those comprising hybrids incorporating&#xD;
      a synthetic component with a biologic component. DermACELL (LifeNet Health,Virginia Beach,&#xD;
      VA) is acellular dermal matrices (ADM), which has been shown to be effective in treating&#xD;
      chronic DFUs in a clinical trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Another ADM product available in the market is made by IntegraÂ® (Bilayer Matrix Wound&#xD;
      Dressing, Integra LifeSciences). However, advantages/disadvantages of one compared to the&#xD;
      other are unclear. In addition, prior studies often focused on wound healing outcomes (e.g.&#xD;
      time to heal, success of wound healing) without considering patient-centered and&#xD;
      physician-centered outcomes such as time and difficulty to apply, likelihood of adverse&#xD;
      events and need for reapplication, poor tissue mechanics outcomes (e.g. presence of scarring&#xD;
      or tissue biomechanics properties leading to increase in shear or pressure post healing thus&#xD;
      increasing likelihood of recurrence of the ulcer), and other patient centered outcomes like&#xD;
      smell, pain, and comfort.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of this prospective, randomized trial is to compare the outcomes of&#xD;
      DermaCELL with Integra. The investigators assumed that the wounds outcomes (e.g. weekly wound&#xD;
      size change, time to heal, time to successful wound granulation) are comparable between&#xD;
      DermaCELL and Integra. However, from operation and patient centered outcomes, there may be&#xD;
      some noticeable differences. For instance, DermaCELL, thanks to its mesh structure, thin&#xD;
      thickness, and no need for hydration, may be easier to apply with shorter time than Integra.&#xD;
      The factors are of key importance in operation room (OR) setting and could reduce overall&#xD;
      cost of application and needs in using OR resources. Other important outcomes least addressed&#xD;
      in prior studies are number of grafts failing, adverse events (e.g. amputation, infection,&#xD;
      etc), cost of wound healing treatment, tissue biomechanics, which may lead to recurrence of&#xD;
      ulcers (e.g. formation of tissue scarring), and other patient-centered outcomes (e.g. pain,&#xD;
      quality of sleeping, wound smelling, etc). For instance, many patients are unhappy with&#xD;
      smelling of wounds, which make them embarrassed among their family members like grand kids.&#xD;
      Thus reducing wound smelling during activities of daily living is often considered as an&#xD;
      important patient centered outcomes.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>The investigators will randomize using 1-1 ratio and based on wound cases. In the case that a subject had two eligible wound cases, the randomization will be done to have similar probably for the wound location (e.g. forefoot, mid-foot, hind-foot, etc). If an eligible subject had more than two wounds, only one of them will be considered as an intervention and only one of them as a control case.</intervention_model_description>
