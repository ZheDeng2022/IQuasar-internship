  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Multiple myeloma (MM) is a plasma cell neoplasm representing the second most common type of&#xD;
      hematologic tumor after lymphomas. The incorporation of novel agents such as bortezomib,&#xD;
      lenalidomide, or thalidomide into first-line treatment as well as in relapse settings has led&#xD;
      to a significant improvement in survival rates for MM patients, which have doubled in the&#xD;
      last 5-7 years (1,2). However, except for a small percentage of patients (10-30%)(3) that may&#xD;
      achieve a cure after first-line treatment, in the majority of cases, MM behaves as an&#xD;
      incurable disease whose clinical course is characterized by repeated relapses, shorter and&#xD;
      shorter periods of remission, and by becoming refractory to succesive treatments (bortezomib&#xD;
      or lenalidomide). In this situation, survival is generally less than 9 months, which&#xD;
      underscores the need to develop new drugs for MM patients Pomalidomide, a third-generation&#xD;
      immunomodulatory drug (IMiD), has demonstrated efficacy in patients with relapsed and&#xD;
      refractory MM, with an overall response rate that fluctuates between 30-60% depending on&#xD;
      whether it is administered in combination with low-dose dexamethasone or in association with&#xD;
      treatment with a cytostatic agent such as cyclophosphamide.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In clinical trial CC-4047-MM-003, treatment with pomalidomide and low-dose dexamethasone in&#xD;
      patients with relapsed and refractory MM or those intolerant to bortezomib or lenalidomide&#xD;
      was a successful rescue treatment in 30% of patients with a median progression-free survival&#xD;
      of 4 months. The association of cyclophosphamide at dose of 400mg/day on days 1, 8, and 15 of&#xD;
      each cycle is able to increase the overall response rate from 39% for combination&#xD;
      pomalidomide-dexamethasone to up to 65% for the triple regimen (pomalidomide,&#xD;
      cyclophosphamide, dexamethasone - POMCIDEX), as well as the median PFS from 4.4 mo. to 9.2&#xD;
      mo. respectively. As well, the tolerance and safety profiles of the triple combination&#xD;
      pomalidomide, cyclophosphamide, and dexamethasone were acceptable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The association of bortezomib with pomalidomide-dexamethasone also increases the overall&#xD;
      response rate (85%) and prolongs PFS (10.7 months).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The BiRD study (lenalidomide, dexamethasone, and clarithromycin) suggests that clarithromycin&#xD;
      intensifies the effect of corticosteroids, increasing their anti-myeloma effect . A study&#xD;
      evaluating the combination of clarithromycin with pomalidomide and low-dose dexamethasone in&#xD;
      RRMM patients showed an overall response rate of 57% and clinical benefit rate (considered&#xD;
      equal or superior to minor response) of 66%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since July 2014, pomalidomide (ImnovidÂ®) in combination with dexamethasone has been approved&#xD;
      for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed and refractory MM who have received at&#xD;
      least two prior lines of therapy (including bortezomib and lenalidomide) and who have shown&#xD;
      progressive disease to the last line of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Spain in January of 2015, and in the Spanish Myeloma Group (GEM) context, we implemented&#xD;
      clinical practice guidelines for the treatment of RRMM patients who are candidates for&#xD;
      pomalidomide treatment with a triple therapy combination pomalidomide + cyclophosphamide +&#xD;
      low-dose dexamethasone (POMCIDEX) (Appendix 1). The goal of the clinical practice guidelines&#xD;
      was to increase the overall response rate, quality of response, and progression-free survival&#xD;
      in patients treated with POMCIDEX. In patients with suboptimal response (defined as stable&#xD;
      disease in the first 3 cycles, or inferior to partial response after six cycles according to&#xD;
      International Myeloma Working Group Uniform Response Criteria [7]), clarithromycin can be&#xD;
      added to their treatment at a dose of 500mg/12hrs on days 1-28 of each cycle. Treatment can&#xD;
      be administered until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or based on patient&#xD;
      decision.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Keeping in mind the time that has passed since the approval of pomalidomide for use in Spain&#xD;
      and the publication of the clinical practice guidelines, we believe it is now time for a&#xD;
      retrospective evaluation of the results of the therapeutic guidelines for Spanish MM patients&#xD;
      and to review the viability of the recommendations contained in the guidelines with respect&#xD;
      to compliance with the same, and effectiveness of the planned course of treatment. Once the&#xD;
      viability of the proposed therapy regimen has been evaluated, other analyses for the purpose&#xD;
      of studying the clinical results of treatment can be carried out as a separate analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The therapeutic paradigm for MM is rapidly changing due to the availability of new drugs for&#xD;
      the treatment of patients with refractory or relapsed disease, making clinical decisions more&#xD;
      challenging. For this reason, the availability of data obtained from real-life settings,&#xD;
      outside of clinical trials, is essential in order to choose the appropriate treatment for&#xD;
      each patient&#xD;

      This is a national, multicentre, observational, retrospective, open-label, non-randomized,&#xD;
      non-interventional study to evaluate the degree of compliance at PETHEMA centres in Spain&#xD;
      with the clinical practice guidelines proposed by the Spanish Myeloma Group for the treatment&#xD;
      of relapsed and refractory MM with POMCIDEX.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, all patients will be included retrospectively who met the inclusion criteria&#xD;
      for the GEM clinical practice guidelines and who were treated with POMCIDEX. The period of&#xD;
      retrospective data collection will be from 01/01/2015 to 01/04/2018.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The period of data collection for the study includes a maximum period of three months to&#xD;
      allow each centre to collect the necessary clinical and demographic data for each patient in&#xD;
      order to fulfill the different study objectives. Patient data will be anonymized and recorded&#xD;
      in the electronic Case Report Form (eCRF) using the RedCap platform. Afterward, data&#xD;
      cleansing and verification will be carried out on all data recorded by the study&#xD;
      investigators. This procedure will be carried out in the six months after database lock.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once the process of recording and verification of patient data is complete, extraction and&#xD;
      statistical analysis of the data will be carried out.&#xD;
