      A voluntary prospective study that will allow registration and follow-up of individuals with&#xD;
      MC4R pathway genetic obesity.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>

      Potential patients will be referred to coordinating centers by their healthcare provider&#xD;
      (treating physician, diagnosing physician or primary care physician) and if eligible will be&#xD;
      invited to enroll in the registry. The Registry Coordinating Center will be responsible for&#xD;
      obtaining consent from adult patients and caregivers of minor patients (as well as assent&#xD;
      from minors when appropriate), screening patients and enrolling them in the registry.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The registry will capture data entered by the patient, the patient's healthcare provider, and&#xD;
      the patient's caregiver using online (electronic) survey tools administered at baseline, and&#xD;
      annually thereafter. The patient's healthcare provider will complete the baseline Healthcare&#xD;
      Provider survey tool, reporting the patient's baseline demographics, medical history,&#xD;
      clinical information, and disease characteristics. The patient and caregiver will complete&#xD;
      their dedicated baseline survey tools answering questions on the impact of disease on their&#xD;
      everyday life. Survey tools include questions on patient and caregiver demographics, patient&#xD;
      physical activity, patient food and hunger episodes, patient quality of life, and caregiver's&#xD;
      perspective of disease burden on the family. Registry patients, caregivers, and healthcare&#xD;
      providers will be contacted annually (approximately every 12 months) by the Registry&#xD;
      Coordinating Center to complete an online follow-up survey tool including a smaller subset of&#xD;
      questions from the baseline survey tools.&#xD;

  <condition>Genetic Forms of Extreme Obesity</condition>
  <eligibility>
    <study_pop>
      <textblock>
        Extreme obesity in adults age 18 or older defined as a BMI &gt;40 kg/m2 or subjects from age 2&#xD;
        through age 18 years with a BMI value that is &gt;1.4 times the corresponding age/gender 95th&#xD;
        percentile value will be eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Second, specific genotypic criteria involving defined major genes contributing to genetic&#xD;
        obesity disorders will also be required for enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients will be eligible to participate in the registry regardless of gender or geographic&#xD;
        location. Other genetic forms of obesity may be added to this list as pathogenetic&#xD;
        etiologies and the potential involvement of specific genes in the hypothalamus upstream or&#xD;
        downstream of the MC4R become better understood.&#xD;
&#xD;
        All known patients, or their caregivers, will be invited to participate. As new patients&#xD;
        resulting from novel gene variants or defects are identified, registry patient enrollment&#xD;
        will continue on an ongoing basis.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Extreme obesity patients aged 2 years and older.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Extreme obesity defined as:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. BMI &gt; 40 kg/m2 in patients 18 years of age or older.&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. BMI value that is &gt;1.4 times the corresponding age/gender 95th percentile value&#xD;
                  in patients who are 2 through 17 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. At least one of the following genotypes:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Bi-allelic (homozygous or compound heterozygous) POMC, PCSK1, LEPR variants&#xD;
                  leading to the physician-confirmed diagnosis of either POMC or LEPR deficiency&#xD;
                  obesity.&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. The presence of high-confidence, high-impact genetic variations (homozygote,&#xD;
                  compound heterozygote, heterozygote or composite heterozygote [i.e., heterozygous&#xD;
                  variants in more than a single gene]) in these same 3 genes (POMC, PCSK1 and&#xD;
                  LEPR) associated with the clinical presentation of extreme obesity&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. The presence of other high-confidence, high-impact genetic variations&#xD;
                  (homozygote, compound heterozygote, heterozygote or composite heterozygote in the&#xD;
                  MC4R gene or other upstream MC4R-pathway genes and selected variants downstream&#xD;
                  in the MC4R-pathway (Table 1) that are carried by extreme obesity patients who do&#xD;
                  not demonstrate specific syndromic obesity clinical presentations. Selected&#xD;
                  Bardet-Biedl syndrome (BBS1 through BBS21) genetic variants or Alström syndrome&#xD;
                  (ALMS) genetic variants possibly contributing to non-syndromic forms of clinical&#xD;
                  extreme obesity will be eligible for enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;

             syndrome. These patients will be referred to existing registries for these specific&#xD;
             syndromic obesity (e.g., Clinical Registry in Bardet-Biedl syndrome [CRIBBS] for BBS&#xD;
