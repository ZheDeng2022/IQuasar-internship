  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies ipilimumab and nivolumab with immunoembolization in treating&#xD;
      patients with uveal melanoma that has spread to the liver. Immunotherapy with monoclonal&#xD;
      antibodies, such as ipilimumab and nivolumab, may help the body's immune system attack the&#xD;
      cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread.&#xD;
      Immunoembolization may kill tumor cells due to loss of blood supply and develop an immune&#xD;
      response against tumor cells. Giving ipilimumab and nivolumab with immunoembolization may&#xD;
      work better in treating patients with uveal melanoma.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;

      with ipilimumab and nivolumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Determine all treatment and immune related toxicities. II. Determine progression free&#xD;
      survival. III. Determine overall survival.&#xD;

    <description>Patients receive ipilimumab IV over 30 minutes and nivolumab IV over 30 minutes on day 1. Patients also undergo immunoembolization on day 2. Cycles repeat every 3 weeks for 12 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients with complete response, partial response, or stable disease may receive nivolumab IV on day 1 and undergo immunoembolization on day 2. Cycles repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. The interval between treatments may be extended up to every 6 weeks at the discretion of the treating physician.</description>
