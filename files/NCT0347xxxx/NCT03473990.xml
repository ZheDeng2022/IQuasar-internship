  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will aim to evaluate the efficacy of a short-term, home-based, high-intensity&#xD;
      interval (HIT) programme in improving cardiovascular fitness in healthy volunteers aged 55&#xD;
      and above, with an age-comparison to younger individuals taking part in the same training&#xD;
      regime.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It will also explore the efficacy of time-matched 'static' interventions for improving&#xD;
      cardiovascular parameters in middle-aged females and older adults.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with lower peak oxygen uptake have higher mortality and morbidity when undergoing&#xD;
      major surgery. Aerobic fitness is a potentially modifiable risk factor for postoperative&#xD;
      complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Traditional pre-operative exercise interventions to improve fitness involve high time and&#xD;
      supervision-demands, often resulting in poor compliance. High-intensity interval training&#xD;
      (HIT) is a time-efficient, feasible method to improve pre-operative fitness, however current&#xD;
      studies only involve exercise in the laboratory setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design Thirty-six healthy volunteers aged 55y and over will be randomly allocated to&#xD;
      one of three groups: 1) Laboratory-HIT; 2) Home-HIT; 3) No intervention. All HIT sessions&#xD;
      will involve a brief warm-up, followed by five 1-minute bouts of high-intensity (body-weight&#xD;
      based) exercise, interspersed with 90-seconds recovery, concluding with a brief cool-down.&#xD;
      The primary endpoint of the study is change in VO2 peak with secondary endpoints of changes&#xD;
      in: anaerobic threshold, insulin sensitivity and muscle mass.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be expected to perform up to a maximum of 16 HIT sessions (maximum 5 sessions&#xD;
      per week) within a period of 31 days. Aerobic fitness will be assessed prior to and following&#xD;
      the exercise, as will body composition, muscle structure, physical function and insulin&#xD;
      sensitivity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the age comparison, 24 young individuals will be recruited to either a control or&#xD;
      home-HIT arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, the efficacy of time-matched 'static' interventions for improving cardiovascular&#xD;
      parameters in 24 middle-aged females will also be assessed as exploratory work for these&#xD;
      interventions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The efficacy of the static interventions in older adults at home will also be explored.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Power calculation: The investigators performed a power calculation for the primary outcome of&#xD;
      VO2 max in older adults using data from a previous study at our centre on home versus&#xD;
      laboratory HIIT. Assuming an effect size F of 0.6 for three groups and a within group SD of&#xD;
      5, the alpha level was set at 0.05 and the 1-beta at 0.80. This concluded that 30&#xD;
      participants would be required. To allow for potential non-completion and missing data 36&#xD;
      older participants will be enrolled to the study (12 to each group).&#xD;
