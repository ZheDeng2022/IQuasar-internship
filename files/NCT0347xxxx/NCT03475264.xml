  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The MRI tools developed by the investigators are well positioned for assessing regional&#xD;
      changes in lung structure and function in preterm children with bronchopulmonary dysplasia&#xD;
      (BPD), in which airway limitation similar to asthma, alveolar simplification similar to&#xD;
      emphysema and pulmonary vascular stunting are expected. To the investigator's knowledge, the&#xD;
      combination of ultra short echo time (UTE) proton, pulmonary vascular proton and&#xD;
      hyperpolarized 129Xe MRI have not yet been explored in BPD, either clinically or&#xD;
      preclinically. The investigators propose that a comprehensive MRI examination may be useful&#xD;
      from a diagnostic perspective, MRI of preterm children without BPD may reveal changes which&#xD;
      are otherwise clinically 'silent' yet still place children at risk for future chronic lung&#xD;
      disease in later life.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Briefly, at the beginning of an approximate three hour study visit, the qualified&#xD;
      investigator (QI) / delegate will explain the study procedure to the participants and the&#xD;
      participants will have an opportunity to ask questions regarding the study procedure.&#xD;
      Following the explanation of the study, written informed consent will be collected at the&#xD;
      beginning of visit 1. Participants who are deemed unable to provide consent will be provided&#xD;
      an assent form and consent will be acquired from their parents/ legal guardians. During the&#xD;
      study visit, participants will undergo: 1) brief medical history and clinical examination&#xD;
      including questionnaires, 2) full pulmonary function tests, lung clearance testing (LCI),&#xD;
      forced oscillation technique (FoT) and exercise testing, 3) proton MRI, 4) spin-density&#xD;
      and/or diffusion-weighted 129Xe MRI, 5) Multiple-breath washout imaging. Qualified research&#xD;
      team members will perform a clinical examination on the participant to record their vital&#xD;
      statistics like age, gender, height, weight, heart rate, respiratory rate, oral temperature&#xD;
      and blood pressure. The QI/delegate, during a brief conversation with the participant, will&#xD;
      collect relevant medical history from the participant to make sure the participant meets all&#xD;
      the inclusion/exclusion criteria for the study. The QI will also make sure that the&#xD;
      participant understands the study procedure and is willing to participate in the study. Based&#xD;
      on the clinical examination results, medical history and the pulmonary function test results,&#xD;
      the QI/delegate will determine if all the inclusion/exclusion criteria are met to proceed&#xD;
      with the MRI part of the study visit.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>MRI ventilation and 1H MRI thoracic cavity volume and tissue density</measure>
    <time_frame>2 years</time_frame>
    <description>Ventilation defect percent (VDP) (%) will be generated for whole lung and individual lung slices using manual or semi-automated segmentation. For proton (1H) thoracic cavity images, the thoracic cavity volume (TCV) will be calculated by manual or semi-automated segmentation.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Apparent Diffusion Coefficients (ADC) and ADC maps</measure>
    <time_frame>2 years</time_frame>
    <description>Diffusion weighted images from each visit will be reviewed and compared with the proton anatomical images. Mean, whole lung, and center slice ADC (and standard deviation) will be calculated and recorded.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Multiple breath washout testing:</measure>
    <time_frame>2 years</time_frame>
    <description>VDP will be calculated as described above based on the first image data set prior to wash-out breaths. A pixel-by-pixel fit of images as a function of washout breath number will then be used to calculate the fractional ventilation map defined as the volume of expired gas leaving a volume divided by its end-inspiratory volume.</description>
