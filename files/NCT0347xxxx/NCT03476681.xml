  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The open label, first-in-human, phase 1, dose escalation component in refractory solid tumors&#xD;
      has been completed. The Maximum Tolerated Dose and Recommended Phase 2 Dose (RP2D) was&#xD;
      determined to be 1.5mg/kg.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Expansion Phase of this study is currently enrolling subjects with non small cell lung&#xD;
      cancer (NSCLC), head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), cervical and uterine cancers&#xD;
      who progressed on front line therapy. Subjects will be treated with NEO-201 at the RP2D (1.5&#xD;
      mg/kg) every 2 weeks in combination with pembrolizumab, given 1 day after the NEO-201, at 400&#xD;
      mg IV every 6 weeks.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The experimental drug called NEO-201 (the &quot;study drug&quot;) is a monoclonal antibody that is&#xD;
      being tested and is not approved for use in the United States by the FDA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As stated above the RP2D was determined at 1.5 mg/kg and in the current Expansion Phase it&#xD;
      will be administered in combination with pembrolizumab. .&#xD;
&#xD;
      A safety lead in will be conducted in the first 3 to 6 subjects to evaluate toxicity prior to&#xD;
      expanding accrual. The safety lead-in will be 42 days in length, consisting of 1 dose of&#xD;
      pembrolizumab and 3 doses of NEO-201 followed by a 2-week assessment for safety, in subjects&#xD;
      with any of the expansion cohorts' targeted disease types. The third patient in the safety&#xD;
      lead in must complete the 30-day assessment (1 dose of pembrolizumab and 3 doses of NEO-201&#xD;
      followed by a 2-week safety evaluation) and be evaluated for toxicity prior to treating&#xD;
      additional patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following completion of the lead-in, expansion cohorts will accrue subjects with NSCLC,&#xD;
      HNSCC, cervical and uterine cancers who progress on frontline therapy.&#xD;

In each cycle the combination will be given sequentially with NEO-201 on Day 1, followed by pembrolizumab on Day 2 to reduce the risk of additive infusion reactions. NEO-201 will be administered IV every 2 weeks on Days 1, 15 and 29 of a 42-day cycle.&#xD;

&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of disseminated or uncontrolled brain metastases or central nervous system&#xD;
             disease. Brain metastases will be considered controlled if SD on two consecutive brain&#xD;
             MRIs, performed at least 2 months apart, and subject is without seizures.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic&#xD;
             composition to NEO-201 or other agents used in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any major surgery within 14 days of enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Receiving any other investigational agents.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  No archival tissue available and a lesion(s) that cannot be safely biopsied via&#xD;
             percutaneous route, or is unwilling to undergo biopsy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has an uncontrolled concomitant illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or&#xD;
             active infection, uncontrolled diabetes mellitus, symptomatic congestive heart&#xD;
             failure, unstable angina pectoris, hypokalemia, family history of Long QT Syndrome or&#xD;
             presence of cardiac arrhythmia.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects who are assessed to have unacceptable risk of developing infection from&#xD;
             neutropenia will be excluded at the Investigator's discretion.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  HIV-positive subjects on combination antiretroviral therapy are ineligible because of&#xD;
             the unknown potential for pharmacokinetic interactions with NEO-201. In addition,&#xD;
             these subjects are at increased risk of lethal infections which could complicate the&#xD;
             toxicity assessment of this study. Appropriate studies will be undertaken in subjects&#xD;
             receiving combination antiretroviral therapy when indicated.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject has other serious medical illness, including a second malignancy, or&#xD;
             psychiatric illness that could, in the Investigator's opinion, potentially interfere&#xD;
             with the completion of treatment according to this protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because the potential for teratogenic or&#xD;
             abortifacient effects due to NEO-201 is unknown. Because there is an unknown but&#xD;
             potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the&#xD;
             mother with NEO-201, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated&#xD;
             with NEO-201.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Additional Exclusion Criteria for Expansion Cohorts&#xD;
&#xD;
        Because patients in the expansion cohort will be receiving pembrolizumab, the following&#xD;
        additional exclusion criteria apply:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has a diagnosis of immunodeficiency or is receiving chronic systemic steroid therapy&#xD;
             (in dosing exceeding 10 mg daily of prednisone equivalent) or any other form of&#xD;
             immunosuppressive therapy within 7 days prior to start of study therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Active autoimmune disease that has required systemic treatment in the past 2 years&#xD;
             (i.e. with use of disease modifying agents, corticosteroids or immunosuppressive&#xD;
             drugs). Replacement therapy (e.g.., thyroxine, insulin, or physiologic corticosteroid&#xD;
             replacement therapy for adrenal or pituitary insufficiency, etc.) is not considered a&#xD;
             form of systemic treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects who experienced severe or life-threatening immune-related AEs with prior&#xD;
             immune checkpoint therapy requiring medical intervention (steroid or immunosuppressant&#xD;
             drugs) and permanent discontinuation of therapy, will be excluded. These include, but&#xD;
             not limited to colitis, autoimmune hepatitis, hypophysitis, hyperthyroidism,&#xD;
             nephritis, myocarditis, GBS, encephalitis.&#xD;
