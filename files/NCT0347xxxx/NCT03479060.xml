      This study evaluates the short and long-term effects of application of Wet Cupping Therapy&#xD;
      (WCT) in the treatment of migraine headaches in adults.Half of the participants will continue&#xD;
      WCT application and the other half will not.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In literature, Cupping therapy(CT) has been shown to be used mostly for pain control and the&#xD;
      majority of RCT studies have shown that CT has potential benefits in pain conditions.&#xD;
      Previous studies have reported the effect of pain mediator substance-P, endorphins,&#xD;
      encephalins and dynorphins on pain(1) In addition to pain control, it is recommended for use&#xD;
      as additional treatment in neurological diseases such as paralysis, Parkinson's disease and&#xD;
      stroke Studies have shown successful results in the short term with the application of CT for&#xD;
      migraine and tension-type headaches (2,3) Methodology Study design and Patient selection&#xD;
      Patients with a history of migraine diagnosis who presented at the Research Polyclinic of&#xD;
      Karabuk University Training and Research Hospital for wet-cupping therapy in the period May&#xD;
      2016-January 2018 were included in the study. Patients were excluded if they had a history of&#xD;
      head and neck surgery, a diagnosis of sinusitis, a diagnosis of fibromyalgia and inflammatory&#xD;
      disease (rheumatism, infection etc.), were pregnant, had a diagnosis of cancer, bleeding&#xD;
      disorder and widespread skin disease, malignant hypertension or any other disease which could&#xD;
      cause headache. The diagnosis of migraine was confirmed by an experienced neurologist and the&#xD;
      migraine type was determined. The medical treatments of the patients were reviewed and MIDAS&#xD;
      was applied to determine the baseline score. In addition to the medical treatment, WCT was&#xD;
      applied once a month, 3 times (Day 0, 30, 60). At the end of the 3rd month patients were&#xD;
      allocated into two parallel arms. They were randomly assigned to the intervention group or&#xD;
      control group in a double blind manner by the sealed opaque envelope technique. Intervention&#xD;
      group continued WCT whereas patients in the control group discontinued the treatment. MIDAS&#xD;
      was applied again at the end of the 6th and 12th months to both of the groups. Disability&#xD;
      values in the 6th and 12th months were evaluated with MIDAS between those who continued&#xD;
      treatment (Group 1) and those who did not (Group 2). Approval for the study was granted by&#xD;
      Turgut Ozal University Ethics Committee, with number 99950669/236, dated 30.06.2014.Study&#xD;
      design, application procedures and any possible side effects were explained to the study&#xD;
      participants and informed consents obtained. All procedures performed in studies involving&#xD;
      human participants were in accordance with the ethical standards of the institutional and/or&#xD;
      national research committee and with the 1964 Helsinki declaration and its later amendments&#xD;
      or comparable ethical standards.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MIDAS The migraine disability score is a scale evaluating disability and loss associated with&#xD;
      migraine. It consists of 7 questions, the 1st, 3rd and 5th of which evaluate the days lost&#xD;
      from school, work, housework or leisure activities because of headaches in the last 3 months.&#xD;
      The 2nd and 4th questions evaluate the number of additional days lost from work or housework&#xD;
      in the last 3 months due to a reduction in productivity (defined as at least a 50% reduction&#xD;
      in productivity). An additional two questions (MIDAS A and B) evaluate the frequency of&#xD;
      headaches and the severity of the headaches using a visual analog scale (VAS), but these are&#xD;
      not added to the total MIDAS score. The total MIDAS points are obtained from the total of the&#xD;
      first 5 questions. Total points of 0-5 = 1st degree (very little or no restriction), 6-10&#xD;
      points =2nd degree (mild or occasional restriction), 11-20 points = 3rd degree (moderate&#xD;
      level of restriction), and 21 + points = 4th degree (severe restriction).&#xD;
