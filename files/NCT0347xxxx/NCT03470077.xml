  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Our primary objective of this study is to compare the effect of administration of single dose&#xD;
      of intravenous nalbuphine given with induction of anesthesia with intravenous nalbuphine&#xD;
      given at the end of surgery on the incidence and severity of EA in children undergoing repair&#xD;
      of rupture globe under general anesthesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary outcomes will include FLACC score for postoperative pain assessment,&#xD;
      hemodynamic variables, any complications as postoperative vomiting (POV) and sedation and&#xD;
      parents' satisfaction score.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Postoperative agitation, also referred to as emergence delirium is characterized by mental&#xD;
      confusion, irritability, disorientation, inconsolable crying, and increased recovery time in&#xD;
      the post anesthesia recovery room, increasing parents' concern and anxiety with respect to&#xD;
      the clinical condition of their children . It can also lead to possible injury, damage to&#xD;
      surgical dressings, lost intravenous catheters, disconnected cables and monitoring&#xD;
      instruments, and source of dissatisfaction for parents, nurses, and others taking care of&#xD;
      these children, and hence the children require extra nursing care and supplemental sedative&#xD;
      and/or analgesic medications, which may delay patient discharge from hospital and are seven&#xD;
      times more likely to have new-onset separation anxiety, apathy, and eating and sleep&#xD;
      problems.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is during the first 30 minutes after emergence that the greatest incidence of agitation is&#xD;
      observed, and duration is generally limited and recovery occurs spontaneously. However,&#xD;
      prolonged episodes of agitation lasting for up to 2 days have been described.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is no definitive explanation for emergence agitation (EA). Many different causes have&#xD;
      been suggested, such as rapid return of consciousness in an unfamiliar environment, the&#xD;
      presence of pain (wounds, sore throat, and bladder distension), stressful induction, airway&#xD;
      obstruction, a noisy environment, the duration of anesthesia, the child's personality,&#xD;
      anesthetic premedication and the anesthetic technique used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While its pathogenesis remains unclear, previous studies reported that ENT (ear, nose, and&#xD;
      throat) surgical procedures have a higher incidence of EA in both adults and children .&#xD;
      Children undergoing strabismus surgery under sevoﬂurane anesthesia often experience EA and&#xD;
      postoperative vomiting (POV) .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Multiple medications including ketamine, propofol, clonidine, midazolam and fentanyl have&#xD;
      been used effectively to prevent EA. However, these medications may increase sedation after&#xD;
      anesthesia, cause slow awakening, and in some cases are associated with undesirable side&#xD;
      effects, such as nausea and vomiting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nalbuphine is a synthetic opioid κ-receptor agonist μ-receptor antagonist with onset of&#xD;
      action occurring within 2-3 min following IV injection, duration of analgesia of 3-6 hours&#xD;
      and plasma half-life of 5 hours. Its analgesic potency approximately equals to morphine with&#xD;
      less effects on cardiovascular and respiratory system, i.e., nalbuphine causes less intensive&#xD;
      and less frequent decrease in blood pressure and respiratory depression.&#xD;
