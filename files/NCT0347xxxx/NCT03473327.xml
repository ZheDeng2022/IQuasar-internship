      The aim of this study is to characterize the systemic stress response (SSR) induced in&#xD;
      patients undergoing colorectal cancer (CRC) surgery. The project is a clinical prospective&#xD;
      study. Blood samples will be collected from 30 patients on the day before CRC-surgery, and 1,&#xD;
      2, 3 and 10 days after surgery. A specimen from the resected tumor tissue will also be&#xD;
      collected and sent for immunohistochemical analysis. Whole blood gene expression profiling&#xD;
      will be performed to gain knowledge of the genetic changes in immunological, inflammatory and&#xD;
      oxidative stress-related factors initiated by surgery. Peripheral immunological cells,&#xD;
      proteins and cytokines will be analysed by FLOW and ELISA methods, and the functional&#xD;
      capacity of NK-cells will also be defined for each time point. Furthermore, tumor tissue will&#xD;
      be analyzed for invasion of immunological cells. At each time point, the patients will be&#xD;
      asked to fill out a validated patient reported outcome measure with questions concerning&#xD;
      clinical outcome parameters related to recovery after CRC-surgery&#xD;

      Background&#xD;
&#xD;
      The perioperative period is relatively short, but highly critical for cancer related&#xD;
      survival. The surgical procedure results in release of tumor cells locally and in the blood,&#xD;
      and induction of a surgical stress response (SSR). This leads to paralysis of the immune&#xD;
      system, reduced clearance of cancer cells and optimal conditions for cancer cells to grow and&#xD;
      metastasize(1).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most common cause of cancer in Denmark. In 2013, 4196&#xD;
      Danish patients were diagnosed with CRC(2) and current standard of care includes a tumour&#xD;
      resection. However, even after an expected curative surgical tumour resection, 25-30% will&#xD;
      have a relapse within 5 years after the primary procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To improve the outcome after surgery for cancer, it is crucial to understand, in details, how&#xD;
      SSR affects the immune response and how SSR affects the ability of cancer cells to grow and&#xD;
      metastasize. By performing expression profiling of over 40.000 genes in whole blood before&#xD;
      and after surgery, we will obtain a genetic signature of genes from circulating immune cells,&#xD;
      including granulocytes, monocytes, B and T cells, dendritic cells, and platelets, which will&#xD;
      enable us to see the exact impact surgery has on gene transcription of these immunological&#xD;
      factors. By using this information, perioperative interventions can be performed to optimize&#xD;
      the immunological response in the perioperative period, leading to reduced risk of cancer&#xD;
      recurrence and consequently improved survival (3).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Surgical stress response (SSR) It is well known that a surgical procedure induces a&#xD;
      disturbance of the immunological and inflammatory balance, causing a systemic inflammatory&#xD;
      response (4), immune suppression (4,5) and excess reactive oxygen species (ROS) (6,7).&#xD;
      Systemic inflammation promotes tumor growth (8), and in patients who have undergone&#xD;
      potentially curative resection for colorectal cancer, the presence of a systemic inflammatory&#xD;
      response predicts a poor outcome (3). The paralysis of the immune system includes reduced&#xD;
      activity of NK cells and macrophages, both of which under normal circumstances protects&#xD;
      against metastasis by eliminating disseminating tumor cells. Excessive ROS causes DNA damage,&#xD;
      break down of extracellular matrix and elimination of cell-cell adhesions (5,6,7). In this&#xD;
      way, surgery promotes optimal conditions for cancer cells to grow and metastasize in the&#xD;
      post-operative phase. Recent research shows that immune cells and their invasion of the&#xD;
      primary tumor correlates to the patient's prognosis, again suggesting that the immune&#xD;
      response is important for inhibition of cancer growth(9,10). Detailed information of genetic&#xD;
      changes in different factors of the immune response due to surgery remains unclear.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design The project consist of a clinical prospective explorative study including 30&#xD;
      patients undergoing elective hemi-colectomy due to colon cancer UICC stadium II-III. Blood&#xD;
      samples will be collected on the day prior to surgery, and on post-operative day 1, 2, 3 and&#xD;
      10. Samples will be prepared for Flow cytometric analysis, bio banking, cryopreservation and&#xD;
      whole blood genomic profiling.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Whole blood gene expression profiling will be performed and analyzed to determine possible&#xD;
      transcriptional changes in genes encoding for immunological, inflammatory and oxidative&#xD;
      stress-related factors caused by surgery. It is possible to make both a quantitative as well&#xD;
      as qualitative measurement of these genetic changes (11).The probe sets that are found to be&#xD;
      the most significantly differentially expressed before and after surgery will be chosen for&#xD;
      further analysis. Genes that are significantly deregulated and have been described in&#xD;
      previous studies, within the field of inflammation, immunological and oxidative stress, will&#xD;
      be chosen for further analysis. Examples of exact genes within immunology and inflammation&#xD;
      will be genes encoding for TNFα, IL-1b, IL-2, IL-6, IL-10, VEGF, TGFβ and HLA-G. Within&#xD;
      oxidative and antioxidative genes, special emphasis will be taken in FoxO3, TP53 and ATM as&#xD;
      inactivation of these are associated with increased levels of ROS. Upregulation of ATOX1,&#xD;
      DEFB122 and GBX8 is associated with increased levels of ROS, and will also be chosen for&#xD;
      further analysis (19-21).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Alterations in specific inflammatory and immune modulating proteins (TNFα, IL-1b, IL-2, IL-6,&#xD;
      IL-10, VEGF, TGFβ and HLA-G), the functional activity of natural killer (NK) cells, and the&#xD;
      fractions and absolute numbers of specific sub-populations of immune cells (CD3+CD4+,&#xD;
      CD3+CD8+, FoxP3+ / CD4+CD25+CD127 /dim regulatory T cells, CD4+HLA-G+ regulatory T cells,&#xD;
      myeloid-derived suppressor cells and NK subsets) will be identified. Results from genetic&#xD;
      transcription analysis and analysis of alterations in inflammatory and immune modulating&#xD;
      proteins, will be compared in order to give a full overview of the SSR, and the effect of&#xD;
      surgery on immunological, oxidative and inflammatory factors, in order to evaluate the&#xD;
      potential carcinogenic effect of surgery, and times and methods of optimal intervention in&#xD;
      this damaging process.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tumor samples from the 30 enrolled patients will be analyzed for the level of invasion of&#xD;
      immunological cells. The results will be correlated to the results from gene expression&#xD;
      profiling and analysis of inflammatory and immune modulating proteins determined in whole&#xD;
      blood samples prior to surgery. Immunohistochemistry will be performed and inflammatory&#xD;
      invasion of the tumor will be evaluated according to Klintrup's methods (12) and the&#xD;
      immunoscore (13). These methods are based on a scoring system defining the deepest point of&#xD;
      invasion of inflammatory cells identified from haematoxylin and eosin slides.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      Whole blood gene expression profiling:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood samples will be collected in PAX-gene tubes and sent for analysis at Odense University&#xD;
      Hospital, Dept. of Clinical Genetics. Total RNA will be extracted using the Paxgene Blood RNA&#xD;
      kit (Qiagen, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA) and quality of RNA will be tested using Agilent 2100&#xD;
      Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, CA). The Message-AmpTM III RNA amplification&#xD;
      kit (Ambion, Austin, TX) will be used to convert total RNA to biotin-labeled aRNA. Labeled&#xD;
      aRNA will be hybridized to Affymetrix HGU133 Plus 2.0 chips. Data pre-processing will be done&#xD;
      in R environment using robust multi-array average expression measure (rma) to perform&#xD;
      background correction, normalization, and expression index calculation of all microarrays.&#xD;
      Further high level analysis will include advanced methods for high dimensional data including&#xD;
      supervised and unsupervised methods. Fold changes will be calculated and Significance&#xD;
      analysis of Microarray (SAM) and t-test will be used to identify differentially expressed&#xD;
      genes, samples and correction for multiple hypothesis testing will be performed using FDR&#xD;
      method. Pathway analysis will be applied to identify the biological mechanisms activated by&#xD;
      the surgical manipulation, using Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA, Broad Institute).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessement of inflammatory and immunological markers:&#xD;
&#xD;
      When all samples have been collected, part of the bio-banked plasma and serum will be used&#xD;
      for measurement of concentrations of TNFα, IL-1b, IL-2, IL-6, IL-10, VEGF, TGFβ and HLA-G by&#xD;
      ELISAs on a BEP2000 ELISA instrument (Siemens Healthcare, Erlangen, Germany) at Roskilde&#xD;
      Hospitals, Dept.of Clinical Biochemistry, where they have a lot of experience with these&#xD;
      measures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis of lekocyte subpopulations:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Multi-color immunophenotyping of leukocyte sub-populations will be performed within 1-2 hours&#xD;
      after blood samples have been drawn. Analysis will be done by the use of BD FACS Canto II&#xD;
      instruments (BD Biosciences, New Jersey, USA). This instrument analyzes eight colors/markers&#xD;
      per tube. By the use of specific marker panels CD3+CD4+, CD3+CD8+, FoxP3+ / CD4+CD25+CD127&#xD;
      /dim regulatory T cells, CD4+HLA-G+ regulatory T cells, myeloid-derived suppressor cells and&#xD;
      NK subsets will be identified. Results will be analyzed according to inflammatory and&#xD;
      immunological up or down regulation in the period from the day before surgery and up to 10&#xD;
      days after.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Immunohistochemical analysis of tumor specimens:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Immunohistochemistry will be performed when all samples have been collected. Depths of&#xD;
      invasion and number of cells expressing CD4, CD8, CD45RO and GZMB will be analyzed. The&#xD;
      analysis will be performed according to the Klintrup's methods, which is a scoring method&#xD;
      ranging from 0-3. A score of 0 indicates no increase in the inflammatory cells at the deepest&#xD;
      point of the tumors invasive margin; 1 indicates a mild and patchy increase; 2 indicates a&#xD;
      prominent inflammatory reaction, and 3 denotes a florid cup-like inflammatory infiltrate at&#xD;
      the invasive edge with frequent destruction of cancer cell islands. These scores are then&#xD;
      classified as low (0 and 1) and high (2 and 3) grade.&#xD;
&#xD;
      NK cells After isolation af cryopreservation of PBMC's, the functional activity of NK cells&#xD;
      is determined in vitro by exposing them to chromium labeled NK sensitive target cells. NK&#xD;
      cell activity is quantified in this assay by the measurement of chromium released from NK&#xD;
      cell lysed targets.&#xD;
