      Investigators aim to directly investigate the molecular properties of bacteria from tracheal&#xD;
      and urinary samples routinely taken in intensive care units (ICU) patients.&#xD;

      Investigators goal is to determine major bacterial activities and properties in the infected&#xD;
      patient as a basis for more targeted, efficient antimicrobial discovery. Investigators will&#xD;
      determine the abundance of dozens to hundreds of pathogen proteins in the samples and in in&#xD;
      vitro cultures of the same pathogen strains using cutting-edge ultra-sensitive proteomics&#xD;
      approaches (Parallel reaction Monitoring (PRM), Sequential Windowed Acquisition of All&#xD;
      Theoretical Fragment Ion Mass Spectra (SWATH-MS). Data will be analyzed using dedicated mass&#xD;
      spectrometry and proteomics packages using parametric and non-parametric statistics (false&#xD;
      discovery rate determination based on decoy databases; t-tests of log-transformed abundance&#xD;
      data with Benjamin-Hochberg corrections for multiple testing, normal distribution of the data&#xD;
      will be evaluated by Kolmogorov-Smirnov test).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on experience from in vitro and animal infection experiments, a sample size of 10 can&#xD;
      reveal 2fold differences in protein abundance among 500 top proteins at a significance of α =&#xD;
      0.05 and a power of β = 0.8 (after correction for multiple testing). However, it is possible&#xD;
      that human patient samples have higher variance compared to animal infection models.&#xD;
      Investigators will thus use a sequential statistics approach in which they continuously&#xD;
      adjust sample size estimates based on the variance of the accumulating data. It may be&#xD;
      possible that no sufficient sample sizes for all bacterial pathogens of interest will be&#xD;
      reached within two years.&#xD;
