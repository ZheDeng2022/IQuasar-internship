    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of magnesium in symptomatic reduction&#xD;
      of mild traumatic brain injury in the adolescent population in the acute setting of injury.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Introduction Mild traumatic brain injuries are a growing problem in sports, and are now&#xD;
      becoming publicly relevant. Mild traumatic brain injuries account for 700,000 ED visits,&#xD;
      hospitalizations, and deaths annually. Today, 1 out of 5 adolescents will be affected by mild&#xD;
      traumatic brain injuries. Magnesium is a critical neuromodulator that plays an important role&#xD;
      in controlling neural signaling in the brain, and studies have shown a transiently low level&#xD;
      of magnesium in CNS neurons following traumatic brain injury. If these electrolyte imbalances&#xD;
      could be corrected with magnesium supplementation during the acute injury, this could&#xD;
      potentially decrease the symptomatic period in those with mild TBI. The investigators aim to&#xD;
      show a correlation between administration of PO magnesium and increased resolution of&#xD;
      symptoms thereby improving the subjective recovery course of adolescents with concussion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study objective This randomized, cohort study will compare the clinical efficacy of PO&#xD;
      magnesium and Zofran, to that of PO Tylenol and Zofran in the treatment of adolescents&#xD;
      presenting within 48 hours of a mild traumatic brain injury.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Purpose With current studies and the sports media revolving around the long-term effects of&#xD;
      repetitive mild TBI, it is important to continue to improve treatment of these injuries.&#xD;
      Current therapy revolves around symptomatic care, rest, and return to school/sport after&#xD;
      symptoms have resolved and the patient has been cleared by a physician. After a concussion,&#xD;
      there is a period of 7-10 days where the patient has a transient decrease in the participants&#xD;
      mental functioning. The investigators hope to decrease the length of the acute symptomatic&#xD;
      period by supplementing oral magnesium along with the current symptomatic care. Studies have&#xD;
      shown that IV magnesium in high doses can improve the function of patients with severe TBI.&#xD;
      There have not been many studies looking at the efficacy of PO magnesium in this setting.&#xD;
      While there is no evidence that concussions have long term effects on neurocognitive&#xD;
      function, this study could add to the existing algorithm for concussion management.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis The investigators believe that administration of magnesium in patients who present&#xD;
      with mild traumatic brain injuries will decrease post concussive symptoms, thereby speeding&#xD;
      recovery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods Study design and setting Randomized, prospective, parallel cohort study comparing two&#xD;
      non-invasive treatments for Mild traumatic brain injury in patients ages 12-18 that present&#xD;
      to the Lakeland Health Emergency departments in either St. Joseph, MI or Niles, MI. The data&#xD;
      collection period will take approximately 2 years with a minimum goal of 76 patients enrolled&#xD;
      in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient selection Patients ages 12-18 presenting to the emergency department with a mild&#xD;
      traumatic brain injury and GCS &gt;13 meeting inclusion criterial will be provided a study&#xD;
      participation form to receive informed consent. ED staff will assess the patient's symptom&#xD;
      severity with the Concussion Symptom Severity Score listed below. After this ED staff will&#xD;
      assess the patient for inclusion criteria, followed by a healthcare provider Exclusion&#xD;
      criteria will be evaluated by the healthcare provider at this time, and medical therapy can&#xD;
      be initiated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Age 12 to 18 years&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Presenting chief complaint of headache, head injury, or concussion following injury to&#xD;
           the patient above the clavicles, within the first 48 hours of injury.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  GCS &gt; 13 on arrival.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Age &lt; 12 years or &gt; 18 years&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Inability to provide informed consent&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Vomiting &gt; 2 episodes following injury&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Physical or mental disability hindering adequate response to assessment of symptoms&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Hemodynamic instability/medical condition requiring further acute life-saving medical&#xD;
           intervention&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Known brain mass, intracranial hemorrhage, skull fracture&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Known contraindications to magnesium use&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Known contraindication to Zofran use&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interventions Informed consent will be obtained after initial assessment of the patient by&#xD;
      the healthcare provider, and inclusion/exclusion criteria are met.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After informed consent is obtained, and the patient meets the criteria for further acceptance&#xD;
      into the study, then the patient's current symptoms will be screened by the healthcare&#xD;
      providers. This will be the symptom score at time &quot;0&quot;. After this the participants will&#xD;
      receive 1 of 2 therapies that will be randomized by date of service whether it is an odd or&#xD;
      even date. The treatment arm of the study (Even Days) will include 800mg of oral magnesium&#xD;
      oxide along with a 4mg Zofran ODT as an initial dose in the emergency department. These&#xD;
      participants will then continue to take 2 tablets of prescribed Magnesium oxide 400mg daily&#xD;
      until their follow up with a physician at a local sports medicine clinic. The placebo arm&#xD;
      (Odd days) of the study will receive 650 mg Acetaminophen, and a 4mg Zofran ODT in the&#xD;
      emergency department. These participants continue to take scheduled acetaminophen 500 mg q8hr&#xD;
      until follow up with a physician in the sports medicine clinic. The participants will have&#xD;
      their symptom score re-evaluated after 1 hour of observation. If stable they will be&#xD;
      discharged. A 24 hour follow up phone conversation will be placed by the primary&#xD;
      investigators for a repeat of their symptom severity score. Finally, the participant will&#xD;
      follow up in the outpatient sports medicine concussion clinic at 120 hours where a 4th&#xD;
      symptom severity score will be obtained. These data will be collected and analyzed to compare&#xD;
      the overall change in symptom severity score between the two treatment arms. The Aim of this&#xD;
      study is to have a total n &gt; 76. This will likely require 2 years of data collection. Our&#xD;
      primary endpoint will be to evaluate if magnesium has an impact on participant's&#xD;
      post-concussion severity index and a change in symptom severity score over time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Symptom assessment Symptom assessment primarily described above, the investigators will use&#xD;
      the standardized Post Concussion Severity. If the participant continues to have pain and a&#xD;
      further intervention is required outside of the treatment and placebo arm the investigators&#xD;
      will provide Ibuprofen weight adjusted for the participant's weight.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ED staff will re-assess the participant and record level of pain at time of study drug&#xD;
      administration and at 60 minutes after study drug administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection Primary data collection through the Concussion symptom severity index.&#xD;
      Outcome measures Primary outcome is a comparison between the treatment and placebo groups in&#xD;
      their changes in symptom severity scores over a 5-day period. Secondary endpoints include&#xD;
      development of adverse effects related to medication administration, need for further&#xD;
      intervention in the emergency department, and whether the participant's have returned to&#xD;
      their baseline function by 120 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data analysis To be coordinated with Dr. William Corser, and an associated statistician team&#xD;
      through Michigan State University. The study design will be a randomized cohort,&#xD;
      repeat-measures efficacy study. The analysis of study results will look at data&#xD;
      categorically, involving case or control group, and will also evaluate symptom scores at set&#xD;
      intervals. An independent sample t test comparing the mean symptom severity scores among the&#xD;
      cases and control groups at initial time of entry into the study, followed by repeat&#xD;
      measurements after 1 hour, 24 hours and 120 hours will then be conducted. Point biserial&#xD;
      correlation testing will also be employed to measure the strength of the relationship between&#xD;
      being a member of either the case or control group with symptom severity scores. The primary&#xD;
      outcome of this study will be the comparison of symptom severity scores between the treatment&#xD;
      and placebo groups over a 5-day period. Anticipated secondary outcomes include but are not&#xD;
      limited to adverse effects relating to medications administered, need for further&#xD;
      intervention in the emergency department and return to baseline function within 120 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethical Considerations Risks The risks of this study are minimal and related to the&#xD;
      administration of medications. Acetaminophen, Zofran, and magnesium have low risk for&#xD;
      development of adverse effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If an adverse reaction to these medications is to occur, while unlikely, the participant will&#xD;
      be treated for these reactions symptomatically. Further medication administration will be&#xD;
      based on the ED provider's discretion at the current standard of care and the participant's&#xD;
      reactions will be documented/included in the secondary outcomes of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Benefits Participant benefits include potential decreased duration of symptoms in the acute&#xD;
      phase of injury following concussion. Magnesium is a relatively benign medication that is&#xD;
      used frequently, and if this can contribute positively to acute concussion management, the&#xD;
      investigators hope to change how mild traumatic brain injuries are managed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Risk/benefit ratio Benefits of subject participation outweighs risk. Current standard of care&#xD;
      is symptomatic care with rest, and follow up if symptoms persist 5-7 days following initial&#xD;
      intervention. Adding magnesium, which has a low adverse effect profile and is an inexpensive&#xD;
      option that could have a large impact on concussion management.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participation Duration Participation in the proposed study will last the duration of their&#xD;
      emergency department visit. Participation will involve a minimum of 30-60 minutes. The&#xD;
      continued participation through the next 5 days is critical to the study to allow proper&#xD;
      follow up, along with medication dosing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rationale for the use of selected subject population Concussions are a growing problem with&#xD;
      socialization and media attention nationally. While there are no long term effects of&#xD;
      concussions, there is an acute phase of injury that if decreased would benefit those with&#xD;
      mild traumatic brain injury. With adolescents, there is a drive to return to normal health,&#xD;
      and often an immediacy for treatment allowing appropriate initial intervention and follow up&#xD;
      in the outpatient office prior to returning to daily activities. The interventions proposed&#xD;
      in this study contain the current standard of care, thereby the addition of magnesium&#xD;
      supplementation is medically benign but could have physiologic potential.&#xD;
