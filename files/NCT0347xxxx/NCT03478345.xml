  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There have been some preliminary studies, primarily in animals, that suggest that exposure to&#xD;
      some of the chemicals in our everyday environment, such as the chemicals found in plastics,&#xD;
      may cause weight gain. It is not clear whether this also happens in humans, or whether&#xD;
      decreasing exposure to these chemicals can improve success with weight loss when people adopt&#xD;
      healthy lifestyle changes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The THRIVE Study is a 4-week group healthy lifestyle education program that is designed to&#xD;
      determine whether:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  changes in dietary habits and the types of personal care products used can decrease a&#xD;
           person's exposure to chemicals in our environment that have been suggested to cause&#xD;
           weight gain&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  whether any measurable changes in body composition (fat tissue vs. lean tissue) can be&#xD;
           seen as a result of participating in the healthy lifestyle program.&#xD;

      Emerging evidence from in vitro and animal models suggests that exposure to endocrine&#xD;
      disrupting chemicals (EDC), or industrial chemicals that alter hormonal action, may&#xD;
      contribute to the development of obesity. Phthalates, a class of industrial chemicals&#xD;
      commonly found in personal care products and food packaging, warrant study since they are&#xD;
      widely detected in the general US population, including reproductive aged-women, and&#xD;
      exposures during adulthood are associated with an increased risk of obesity. However, the&#xD;
      majority of the evidence supporting this hypothesis to date has come from cross-sectional&#xD;
      rather than prospective, longitudinal data. Thus, a causal relationship between EDC exposure&#xD;
      and the development of obesity has not been conclusively established.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently, 60.3% (95% CI: 54.2-66.0) of younger adult Americans (aged 20 - 39) are thought to&#xD;
      be overweight or obese (BMI â‰¥25), which increases the risk of chronic diseases such as&#xD;
      diabetes, cardiovascular disease and cancer. While excess calorie consumption and lack of&#xD;
      physical activity are primary contributors to overweight and obesity, factors other than diet&#xD;
      and physical activity may also contribute to alterations in energy balance over time. The&#xD;
      general public is becoming increasingly concerned about the potential health risks associated&#xD;
      with EDC exposures, including effects on body composition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The THRIVE Study is designed to evaluate the effect of many different EDCs on body&#xD;
      composition changes. The study will focus initially on exposures to the phthalate class of&#xD;
      EDCs, but data will be collected in a way that will allow investigators to evaluate the&#xD;
      effect of many different EDCs on body composition changes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phthalates are a class of high-production-volume industrial chemicals that are ubiquitously&#xD;
      used in commerce. Most phthalates, such as DEHP, are used as plasticizers to impart&#xD;
      flexibility in polyvinyl chloride (PVC) materials such as food packaging, flooring, and&#xD;
      medical devices. In recent years, other phthalates, including diisononyl phthalate (DiNP),&#xD;
      have been replacing DEHP in these applications due, in part, to legislation limiting the use&#xD;
      of DEHP in certain applications such as children's toys. Phthalates can leach, migrate, or&#xD;
      off-gas from products over time and enter the human body through the air we breathe, the food&#xD;
      we eat, and the personal care products that we use on our bodies. Consequently, human&#xD;
      exposure to phthalates is widespread.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phthalates enter foods through contact with plastics (e.g. tubing, conveyor belts or plastic&#xD;
      gloves made with PVC plastics) or recycled paper/cardboard food containers. Phthalates are&#xD;
      more likely to leach into liquids and non-polar solvents such as fats and oils, and thus are&#xD;
      most commonly found in foods high in animal fats such as dairy products and meat.&#xD;
      Low-molecular weight phthalates, such as DEP, di-n-butyl phthalate (DnBP) and DiBP, are&#xD;
      commonly found in fragranced personal care products such as perfumes, deodorants, soaps,&#xD;
      shampoos, and other hair products (e.g. hair sprays, gels, mousses). They can also be found&#xD;
      in time release medications and supplements. Intervention studies suggest that addressing&#xD;
      sources of exposure can lower human exposure to phthalates. In a study of 20 individuals, a&#xD;
      3-day dietary intervention of &quot;fresh foods&quot; (no canned food or foods wrapped in plastic)&#xD;
      resulted in an average reduction in DEHP metabolites of 53-56%. Similarly, a study of 100&#xD;
      Latina girls found that a 3-day intervention with phthalate free personal care products&#xD;
      resulted in a 27.4% reduction in DEP metabolite (mono-ethyl phthalate) levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If phthalate exposures are ultimately found to be associated with body composition changes in&#xD;
      young adults, it could be possible to decrease the risk of these body composition changes by&#xD;
      modifying food selection, preparation and storage techniques, and changing use of personal&#xD;
      care products in addition to traditional diet and physical activity interventions. This, in&#xD;
      turn, could have significant impacts on obesity and chronic disease risk in the US.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While a few studies have indicated that dietary modification and changes in personal care&#xD;
      products use can individually lower urinary phthalate levels, this study will be the first to&#xD;
      combine both a dietary and personal care product intervention. In a study of 20 individuals,&#xD;
      a 3-day dietary intervention of &quot;fresh foods&quot; (no canned food or foods wrapped in plastic)&#xD;
      resulted in an average reduction in DEHP metabolites of 53-56%. Similarly, a study of 100&#xD;
      Latina girls found that a 3-day intervention with phthalate free personal care products&#xD;
      resulted in a 27.4% reduction in DEP metabolite (mono-ethyl phthalate) levels. The hypothesis&#xD;
      of this study is that an intervention that addresses both dietary and personal care product&#xD;
      phthalate exposures can result in an even greater decrease in urinary phthalate metabolites.&#xD;
