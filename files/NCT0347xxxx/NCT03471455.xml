      This study is a prospective, double blinded, randomized, pilot study to assess the&#xD;
      effectiveness of oral low dose isotretinoin in combination with oral terbinafine and&#xD;
      itraconazole in preventing recurrences in chronic recurrent dermatophytosis. The recruited&#xD;
      patients will be randomized into four treatment arms; oral terbinafine alone and oral&#xD;
      itraconazole alone versus oral isotretinoin in combination with each of these two antifungal&#xD;
      agents. Randomization will be done using computer generated random number table. The patients&#xD;
      in first treatment arm will receive 250 mg of oral terbinafine for 4 weeks, the patients in&#xD;
      second treatment arm will receive oral itraconazole 200 mg twice a day for the same duration,&#xD;
      while the patients in the third arm will receive oral terbinafine 250 mg once a day for 4&#xD;
      weeks with oral isotretinoin 20 mg once daily and patients in the fourth arm will receive&#xD;
      oral itraconazole 200 mg twice a day for 4 weeks with oral isotretinoin 20 mg once daily. In&#xD;
      the third and fourth arms, oral terbinafine and oral itraconazole respectively will be&#xD;
      stopped after 4 weeks while oral isotretinoin will be continued for 6 months with monthly&#xD;
      monitoring of liver function tests and fasting lipid profile.The patients will be followed at&#xD;
      monthly intervals for recurrence and treated appropriately.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective is to evaluate the effectiveness of low dose isotretinoin (20 mg/day)&#xD;
      in preventing recurrences in chronic recurrent dermatophytosis by comparing the frequencies&#xD;
      of recurrence in patients who are on low dose isotretinoin during the follow up versus those&#xD;
      who are not comparing the disease free interval between the four randomized groups at monthly&#xD;
      follow up for a total duration of 6 months.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Over the last couple of years, the major concern in dermatophytic infections has been the&#xD;
      occurrence of recurrent infections. This, in spite of the patients being treated with gold&#xD;
      standard drugs, namely, terbinafine, griseofulvin, and even azoles like itraconazole, in&#xD;
      adequate doses. The world is experiencing a menace of recurrent and chronic dermatophyte&#xD;
      infections in a magnitude that is unprecedented. Such cases are making up a large proportion&#xD;
      of cases seen every day in the outpatient department. To make matters worse, there is as yet,&#xD;
      no standard definition of the terms 'Ã§hronic', 'recurrent', or 'resistant' tinea infections,&#xD;
      although arbitrary definitions exist, like 'chronic dermatophytosis' being described in lay&#xD;
      terms as &quot;patients who have suffered from the disease for more than 6 months to 1 year&#xD;
      duration, with or without recurrence, in spite of being treated&quot;, and recurrent&#xD;
      dermatophytosis being defined as the reoccurrence of the dermatophyte infection within few&#xD;
      weeks, after completion of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Alteration of immune pattern in dermatophytosis The development of antibodies (IgM, IgG, IgA&#xD;
      and IgE) to dermatophyte infection seems not to substantially contribute to the elimination&#xD;
      of fungal infections because highest antibody levels can be found in patients with chronic&#xD;
      fungal infections. Studies by Jones in human volunteers suggested that cell-mediated immunity&#xD;
      is the major immunologic defence mechanism in dermatophyte infection.Healthy volunteers&#xD;
      infected with T. Mentagrophytes developed cell-mediated immunity resulting in mycologic cure.&#xD;
      This was associated with intense inflammation due to T-cell mediated DTH, judging from the&#xD;
      trichophytin skin test. A protective immunologic memory was indicated by elimination of T.&#xD;
      mentagrophytes on re-inoculation and a continued positive trichophytin test. Impaired&#xD;
      cell-mediated immunity in atopic persons is also believed to be the underlying mechanism for&#xD;
      an increased susceptibility to T rubrum infections. Patients with allergic bronchial asthma&#xD;
      or allergic rhinitis often develop chronic or recurrent fungal infections associated with&#xD;
      high immediate-type hypersensitivity (high IgE levels) and low or waning DTH to trichophytin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Green et al. showed that athymic rats that lack T-cell-mediated immunity could not clear T.&#xD;
      mentagrophytes infection in contrast to their genetically matched euthymic control rats.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Chronic dermatophytosis is associated with a depression in cell-mediated immunity to&#xD;
      dermatophytes. A selective antigen-specific immunodeficiency may be the underlying factor in&#xD;
      such patients, and the continued presence of infecting dermatophytes or residual fungal&#xD;
      elements may induce a tolerant state by flooding the host with antigenic material, resulting&#xD;
      in a selective loss of cell-mediated immunity. Alternatively, fungal elements may interact&#xD;
      with host skin to alter the cytokine milieu such that effective type I immune responses for&#xD;
      eliminating organisms are suppressed. In a study done to evaluate immune response in T rubrum&#xD;
      onychomycosis and to determine whether immune reactivity or nonreactivity can be a predictor&#xD;
      of therapeutic outcome, a double-blind comparison was done of the effects of terbinafine with&#xD;
      placebo tablets. Skin tests were performed using trichophytin antigen injected intradermally&#xD;
      in the upper left arm. It was found that skin reactivity to trichophytin antigen decreases&#xD;
      with increasing disease chronicity. Patients with longstanding disease demonstrated absent or&#xD;
      significantly blunted skin reaction to trichophytin antigen compared with patients who had&#xD;
      disease for less than 5 years. Patients who were reactive at baseline were the first to&#xD;
      become mycologically negative in response to terbinafine treatment, and increases in skin&#xD;
      reactivity were related to conversion to negative mycology. Subjects anergic at baseline who&#xD;
      converted with treatment had a more favorable outcome overall than persistent nonconverters.&#xD;
      It is already known that terbinafine and azoles eliminate the fungal elements and restore&#xD;
      cellular immunity resulting in eradication of the oragnisms and cure of the infection. In our&#xD;
      study, we plan to analyse if low dose oral isotretinoin has any role to play in the&#xD;
      maintenance of the cure achieved by itraconazole by decreasing the number of relapses and&#xD;
      whether it leads to an alteration of skin reactivity to trichophytin. If indeed we observe&#xD;
      that isotretinoin does, in fact, reduce the number of relapses, it would be interesting to&#xD;
      know if there is an immunological basis for this, given that isotretinoin is known to be an&#xD;
      immunomodulator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Probable antifungal Resistance Mechanisms in Dermatophytes In vivo, anti fungal resistance is&#xD;
      also correlated with antifungal misuse because patients often fail to finish the full course&#xD;
      of treatment. Thus, the inadequate use or dosage of drugs contributes to the failure in&#xD;
      eliminating the disease agent completely, encouraging growth of the most resistant strains,&#xD;
      which may lead to hard-to-treat fungal infections.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Only few reports have addressed the drug resistance mechanism in dermatophytes, and most of&#xD;
      them have been described in T. rubrum. It is noteworthy that resistance to a particular drug&#xD;
      can be achieved by more than one mechanism and probably, under certain circumstances, they&#xD;
      are activated simultaneously.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although dermatophytes have powerful metabolic machinery for survival, they have to overcome&#xD;
      many pitfalls imposed by the host. Thus, dermatophytes have developed mechanisms that allow&#xD;
      them to avoid the host defences such as the immunosuppressive action of fungal mannans that&#xD;
      causes reduction of inflammation and phagocytosis. The chemical composition of the cell wall&#xD;
      of dermatophytes plays an important role in pathogenicity because of the existing correlation&#xD;
      between alteration in the chemical composition of the cell wall, cell dimorphism and&#xD;
      virulence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Probable role of Isotretinoin against dermatophytes Following adherence, successful&#xD;
      installation of dermatophytes requires rapid germination of arthroconidia and penetration of&#xD;
      hyphae into the stratum corneum. Failure to do so results in elimination by the continuous&#xD;
      desquamation of the epithelium. Retinoids act as modulators of epidermal growth and&#xD;
      differentiation. Although they normalize proliferation in hyperproliferative epithelia as in&#xD;
      psoriasis; in normal epidermis, they promote cell proliferation. Therefore, increased cell&#xD;
      turnover in the epidermis may halt the spread of ongoing infection by eliminating the growing&#xD;
      dermatophyte. Retinoids are also known to alter terminal differentiation towards a&#xD;
      non-keratinizing, metaplastic and mucosa-like epithelium.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Another aspect is the altered glycosylation pattern of normal skin treated with retinoic acid&#xD;
      that resembles that of mucosal epithelium with a reduction of tonofilaments, decreased&#xD;
      corneocyte cohesiveness, impaired function of the permeability barrier and increased&#xD;
      transepidermal water loss. This could thus explain the keratolytic effect of retinoids in&#xD;
      hyperkeratotic disorder and could be extrapolated to any probable role of isotretinoin that&#xD;
      we see in chronic and recurrent dermatophyte infections.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once established, the dermatophytes must scavenge for nutrients for growth, a process&#xD;
      dependent on the induction of structural proteins, permeases and enzymes of the cell wall, in&#xD;
      addition to the secretion of a variety of proteins and hydrolytic enzymes such as nucleases,&#xD;
      lipases, non-specific proteases and keratinases that occur in response to a shortage in the&#xD;
      supply of essential nutrients in the host. Dermatophytes de-repress non-specific proteolytic&#xD;
      enzymes and keratinases which have optimum activity at acidic pH and are important virulence&#xD;
      factors. Thus, their growth is dependent on the pH of the skin which being acidic gives an&#xD;
      ideal ambient environment for the fungus. High transepidermal water loss values and impaired&#xD;
      barrier function of the skin are correlated with high skin pH. Retinoid therapy is known to&#xD;
      raise the skin pH, thereby possibly inhibiting dermatophyte growth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Retinoids are generally thought to stimulate humoral and cellular immunity. They can enhance&#xD;
      antibody production and stimulate peripheral blood T helper cells. Cell surface antigens of T&#xD;
      cells and natural killer cells have been reported to increase after retinoid exposure in&#xD;
      vitro. On the other hand, dermatophytes have mechanisms that allow them to evade the host&#xD;
      response such as the immunosuppressive action of fungal mannans that causes reduction of&#xD;
      inflammation and phagocytosis. Retinoids may counteract some of these immunosuppressive&#xD;
      effects of the dermatophyte.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Finally, although more often associated with bacteria, pure fungal biofilms are a recognized&#xD;
      entity, especially in yeasts like candida. Unlike candidal infections where the concept of&#xD;
      fungal biofims has received considerable attention and is established, the same is not true&#xD;
      for dermatophyte infections. Though it was introduced by Burkhart et al. to explain&#xD;
      dermatophytomas, a form of onychomycosis refractory to standard antifungal therapies, it is a&#xD;
      relatively virgin territory with hardly any published literature. The anecdotal efficacy of&#xD;
      minocycline and isotretinoin in noninflammatory comedonal acne is more easily explained by&#xD;
      their effects on altering the P acnes biofilm and lowering production of biological glue&#xD;
      present in the biofilm. If the investigators can extrapolate the role of isotretinoin in P&#xD;
      acnes biofilm to that of dermatophytes, it could potentially lead to tremendous insights into&#xD;
      using an old but extremely efficacious drug for a novel indication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This will be a randomized open label single centre study. It will involve recruitment of&#xD;
      patients with recurrent cutaneous dermatophytosis based on inclusion and exclusion criteria.&#xD;
      The participants will be randomized (by block randomization) into four arms - Arm A will be&#xD;
      treated with tablet terbinafine 250 mg once a day for 4 weeks, arm B will receive tablet&#xD;
      terbinafine 250 mg once a day with low dose isotretinoin 20 mg/day, arm C will receive&#xD;
      capsule itraconazole 200 mg/ day for 4 weeks, and arm D will be treated with capsule&#xD;
      itraconazole 200 mg/ day for 4 weeks along with low dose isotretinoin (20 mg/day). Allocation&#xD;
      concealment will be done by the sequentially numbered, opaque, sealed envelopes (SNOSE)&#xD;
      method. After 4 weeks of treatment, arms B and D will continue to receive isotretinoin during&#xD;
      subsequent 5 months of follow up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology All adults attending General OPD, Department of Dermatology, Venereology and&#xD;
      Leprology, PGIMER, Chandigarh and satisfying the inclusion and exclusion criteria shall be&#xD;
      eligible for recruitment in the present study after patients sign the written informed&#xD;
      consent form. Complete physical examination including cutaneous, general and systemic&#xD;
      examination will be done and recorded in case record proforma (annexure 1). Baseline clinical&#xD;
      photographs will be taken for all patients.&#xD;
