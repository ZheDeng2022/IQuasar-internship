  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the efficacy of intra-articular administration of RegenoGel-OSP™ and&#xD;
      RegenoGel™ to treat knee pain and effect on subject's activity and quality of life. During&#xD;
      the study the subjects will receive two treatments at a 3-month interval. The study is&#xD;
      double-blinded. The subjects will be randomized and sequentially assigned to RegenoGel-OSP™,&#xD;
      RegenoGel or placebo treatment in the first treatment. In the second treatment after interval&#xD;
      of three months all the subjects will necessarily receive one of the two active products. The&#xD;
      follow-up period will continue for one year after first treatment.&#xD;

    <measure>Efficacy assessment on change in pain in the affected knee joint in response to treatment using the Visual Analog Score (VAS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Three months</time_frame>
    <description>Change in pain in the effected knee joint in response to treatment using the Visual Analog Score (VAS). VAS score is measured according to the patient's pain rating scale from 1 to 10. The scale of pain increases with increasing pain. For example, score 1 indicates absence of pain (minimum score) and score 10 indicates unbearable pain (maximum score). Each VAS score amounts to only one number of outcome from 1 to 10. VAS will be determined in resting position and in active position. No subscales are combined here.</description>
