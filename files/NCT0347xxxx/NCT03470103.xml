    <textblock>
      The main objectives of this observational cohort study are to describe the use of&#xD;
      intravitreal aflibercept and to describe follow-up as well as treatment patterns in patients&#xD;
      with wAMD or DME in routine clinical practice in Latin America for a study population of&#xD;
      treatment naive patients and those who have received prior therapy (anti-VEGF injections,&#xD;
      laser, steroids, etc.) and are being switched to intravitreal aflibercept injection.&#xD;

        The study population will consist of patients with wAMD or DME treated with intravitreal&#xD;
        aflibercept. If both eyes are eligible, data from both eyes will be captured, but only one&#xD;
        eye will be considered the study eye and included in the study analyses. The eye included&#xD;
        will be at the physician's discretion and only visits related to the study eye will be&#xD;
        captured in the electronic Case Report Form (eCRF).&#xD;

             intravitreal treatment received, including, anti- VEGF agents, steroids, steroid&#xD;
             implants and/or PDT) and patients that are switching from a different anti-VEGF&#xD;
             therapy are both eligible to be included. DME patients that have received previous&#xD;
             laser only will be classified as treatment naïve.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  If of childbearing potential, female willing to use effective contraception during&#xD;
             treatment and for at least 3 months after the last intravitreal injection of&#xD;

&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Active intraocular inflammation in the study eye.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Scar, fibrosis, or atrophy involving the center of the fovea in the study eye.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with advanced glaucoma, visually significant cataracts, or any eye disease&#xD;
             likely to require surgery during the study period in the study eye.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Concomitant ocular or systemic administration of drugs that could interfere with or&#xD;
             potentiate the mechanism of action of intravitreal aflibercept, including anti-VEGF&#xD;
             agents.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients receiving a different anti-VEGF agent other than intravitreal aflibercept for&#xD;
             the fellow eye.&#xD;
