    <textblock>
      The QBECO-CD-02 trial in subjects with moderate to severe Crohn's disease (CD) is intended to&#xD;
      build on past experience with QBECO SSI and further establish the safety and efficacy of&#xD;
      QBECO SSI for the induction of clinical and/or endoscopic response and remission.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be conducted in three stages; a Lead-in, Main Induction and Main Maintenance&#xD;
      .The first 20 patients will be enrolled in the Lead-in study, at approximately 5 study&#xD;
      centers in Canada. Subsequent patients will be enrolled in the Main study, which aims to&#xD;
      enroll 150 patients. The Lead-in component will be an open-label study to evaluate endoscopic&#xD;
      healing endpoints. The Main Induction study will be randomized and placebo-controlled.&#xD;
      Participants meeting response criteria following the Main Induction study will be eligible to&#xD;
      continue into the Main Maintenance study, remaining on their initially randomized treatment.&#xD;
      Participants not meeting response criteria will complete their follow-up and study&#xD;
      involvement at the end of the Main Induction.&#xD;

      The QBECO-CD-02 trial in subjects with moderate to severe Crohn's disease (CD) is intended to&#xD;
      build on past experience with QBECO SSI and further establish the safety and efficacy of&#xD;
      QBECO SSI for the induction of clinical and/or endoscopic response and remission.&#xD;
&#xD;
      i. Overall Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase II, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study in subjects with moderate to&#xD;
      severe Crohn's disease to establish the safety and efficacy of QBECO SSI for the induction&#xD;
      and maintenance of clinical and/or endoscopic response and remission. The study will be&#xD;
      conducted in three stages; a Lead-in, Main Induction and Main Maintenance . The first 20&#xD;
      patients will be enrolled in the Lead-in study, at selected study centers. Subsequent&#xD;
      patients will be enrolled in the Main study. The Lead-in component will be an open-label&#xD;
      study to evaluate endoscopic healing endpoints. The Main Induction study will be randomized&#xD;
      and placebo-controlled. Participants meeting response criteria following the Main Induction&#xD;
      study will be eligible to continue into the Main Maintenance study, remaining on their&#xD;
      initially randomized treatment. Participants not meeting response criteria will complete&#xD;
      their follow-up and study involvement at the end of the Main Induction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Endpoints will be evaluated at various times throughout each stage of the study. In&#xD;
      the Lead-In study, primary endpoints will be measured at Week 16 and 26 for determination of&#xD;
      the induction duration and again at Week 52 as initial data on maintenance. In the Main&#xD;
      Induction, the primary endpoints will be assessed when the last subject completes the&#xD;
      induction period, either Week 16 or Week 26 depending on the finding of the Lead-In. In the&#xD;
      Main Maintenance, the primary endpoints will be measured at Week 52. Safety Assessments will&#xD;
      be carried out throughout the study and at the Week 56 visits for all subjects completing the&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be run at approximately 50 study centers in Canada, the United States of&#xD;
      America and Eastern Europe.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ii. Number of Participants:&#xD;
&#xD;
      20 participants will be enrolled in the Lead-In study. No Lead-In study participants will be&#xD;
      enrolled in the Main Induction or Maintenance component of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      150 participants will be randomized to the Main Induction study, resulting in an estimated&#xD;
      total of 70 subjects proceeding to the Main Maintenance component of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      iii. Intervention Groups and Duration:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Approximately 170 adult subjects (N=170) with moderate to severe CD, 20 patients in the&#xD;
      Lead-In study and 150 patients in the Main study, stratified by prior anti-TNFα inhibitor/&#xD;
      biologic therapy use. Patients will be randomized 2:1, active drug:placebo, and will receive&#xD;
      52 weeks of QBECO SSI treatment or placebo.&#xD;
