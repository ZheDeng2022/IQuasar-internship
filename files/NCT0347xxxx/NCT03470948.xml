  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The number of new cases of pancreatic cancer is 12.4 per 100,000 men and women per year. The&#xD;
      number of deaths is 10.9 per 100,000 men and women per year. These rates are age-adjusted and&#xD;
      based on 2009-2013 cases and deaths1. This cancer has a very poor prognosis and around 7.7%&#xD;
      of these patients have a 5 years survival rate. Whipple procedure is the surgical treatment&#xD;
      option for cancer pancreas, where the head of the pancreas, the gallbladder, part of the&#xD;
      stomach, part of the small intestine, and the bile duct are removed.Those that undergoes this&#xD;
      procedure, the 5 year survival rate increases to about 20%2. The duration of intensive care&#xD;
      unit monitoring and hospital stay are longer than for most upper gastrointestinal surgeries.&#xD;
      Pancreaticoduodenectomy is a major operation, carrying significant risk of morbidity and&#xD;
      mortality with 30 - 60% complication rate3. The possibility of identifying patients at risk&#xD;
      for postoperative complications and targeting them from surveillance and early treatment&#xD;
      offers an opportunity to develop interventions that might significantly improve outcomes and&#xD;
      efficiency. Gawande et al. developed and validated the surgical Apgar score (SAS) and&#xD;
      demonstrated that SAS can be useful for rating the condition of patients after general or&#xD;
      vascular surgery4. SAS is based on intraoperative blood loss, blood pressure, and heart&#xD;
      rate3. The score is very simple and easy to calculate and can be available immediately after&#xD;
      surgery. Several validation studies have reported that SAS is useful for predicting the risk&#xD;
      of complications associated with various procedures4-10. We investigated this SAS could&#xD;
      predict major postoperative complications among patients undergoing Whipples procedure in&#xD;
      patients with pancreatic cancer.&#xD;

      This is a prospective, observational, non-interventional, non-randomized study involving the&#xD;
      adult patients undergoing Whipple's procedure. Institutional ethics permission and written&#xD;
      informed consent will be taken from the patient. The study duration will be for a period of 5&#xD;
      years, but the data of the first one year will be analysed and will presented as a thesis for&#xD;
      MD (Anaesthesia). Administration of anaesthesia and reversal of neuromuscular blocking drugs&#xD;
      will be carried as per the institutional routine practice and at the discretion of&#xD;
      anaesthesiologist in charge. The study will include patients undergoing Whipple's procedure&#xD;
      for pancreatic cancer, between age group of 18-75years, with ASA-PS I - III. Preoperative,&#xD;
      intraoperative and outcome variables as defined according to the definitions established by&#xD;
      the American college of surgeons National Surgeons Quality Improvement Program (NSQIP) will&#xD;
      be recorded. A total of 11 preoperative, 14 intraoperative and 21 outcome variables will be&#xD;
      collected (see Appendix). All the post operative outcome variables will be defined.&#xD;
      Preoperative comorbid conditions will also be recorded. SAS will be calculated from three&#xD;
      intraoperative variables (1) the estimated blood loss (EBL), (2) lowest heart rate (HR), and&#xD;
      (3) lowest mean arterial pressure (MAP). For analysis, SAS will be classified as low (≤ 4&#xD;
      points), intermediate (5-6 points) and high (7-9 points). Complications including mortality&#xD;
      will be assessed Upto 30 days postoperatively. The categorization of the complications as&#xD;
      major and minor is consistent with NSQIP definition. Major complications include acute kidney&#xD;
      injury, blood loss ≥ 2000ml, transfusion requiring ≥ 4 U packed blood cells within 72 hours&#xD;
      of surgery, cardiac or respiratory arrest requiring cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), coma&#xD;
      for 24 hours or longer, deep venous thrombosis, septic shock, acute myocardial infarction,&#xD;
      new onset arrhythmias, unplanned re-intubation, ventilator use for 48 hours or longer,&#xD;
      pneumonia, pulmonary embolism, stroke, wound disruption, deep or organ space surgical site&#xD;
      infection, sepsis, systemic inflammatory response syndrome, unplanned intensive care unit&#xD;
      (ICU) admission, need for reoperation, anastomotic leak or fistula, vascular, ureteral or&#xD;
      neural injuries, unplanned readmission &lt; 30 days of discharge, and death. The occurrence of&#xD;
      major postoperative complications within 30 days of surgery represents primary outcome. Some&#xD;
      of the patients do follow-up at day 30 to the OPD and those patients who don't follow-up at&#xD;
      day 30 will be assessed and interviewed by telephone. If they are not able to follow-up on&#xD;
      day 30, they will be contacted telephonically and interviewed for a period of 10-15 minutes,&#xD;
      by a research nurse or a research doctor. Only mortality will be noted at day 30.&#xD;
