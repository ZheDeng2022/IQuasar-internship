  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate whether virus-specific T cell lines (VSTs) are safe&#xD;
      and can effectively control three viruses (EBV, CMV, and adenovirus) in patients who have had&#xD;
      a stem cell transplant and also in patients that have a primary immunodeficiency disorder&#xD;
      with no prior stem cell transplant.&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of the study is to evaluate whether most closely HLA-matched&#xD;
      multivirus-specific T cell lines obtained from a bank of allogeneic virus-specific T cell&#xD;
      lines (VSTs) have antiviral activity against three viruses: EBV, CMV and adenovirus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Reconstitution of anti-viral immunity by donor-derived VSTs has shown promise in preventing&#xD;
      and treating infections associated with CMV, EBV and adenovirus post-transplant. However, the&#xD;
      time required to prepare patient-specific products and lack of virus-specific memory T cells&#xD;
      in cord blood and seronegative donors, limits their value. An alternative is to use banked&#xD;
      partially HLA-matched allogeneic VSTs. A prior phase II study at Baylor College of Medicine&#xD;
      using trivirus-specific VSTs generated using monocytes and EBV-transformed B cells&#xD;
      gene-modified with a clinical grade adenoviral vector expressing CMV-pp65 to activate and&#xD;
      expand specific T cells showed the feasibility, safety and activity of this approach for the&#xD;
      treatment of refractory CMV, EBV and Adenovirus infections. More recent protocols utilizing&#xD;
      synthetic viral peptide pools allow ex vivo expansion of T-cells targeting multiple viral&#xD;
      antigens in 10-12 days without use of viral transduction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will evaluate whether partially-HLA matched allogeneic multivirus-specific VSTs,&#xD;
      activated using overlapping peptide libraries spanning immunogenic antigens from CMV,&#xD;
      adenovirus and EBV, will be safe and produce anti-viral effects in immunodeficient recipients&#xD;
      infected with one of more of the targeted viruses that are persistent despite conventional&#xD;
      anti-viral therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will evaluate safety and efficacy of partially-matched VST therapy in A) patients&#xD;
      who have persistent viral infections in the post-HSCT period, and B) patients with primary&#xD;
      immunodeficiency conditions who have persistent viral infections and have not undergone HSCT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study agent will be assessed for safety and antiviral activity.&#xD;
