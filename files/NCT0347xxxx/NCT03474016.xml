      Breast cancer (BC) is the most common cancer in women worldwide, and is the leading cause of&#xD;
      death from cancer among women globally. Mammography is the standard method for early&#xD;
      detection of BC in many countries, with over 1.3 million annually new diagnosed cases.In&#xD;
      Egypt, breast cancer is the most common cancer in females accounting for 38.8% of all female&#xD;
      cancers. Whereas radiological screening programs have been successfully applied in detecting&#xD;
      breast cancer in earlier stages, no valuable blood biomarkers have been yet identified for&#xD;
      that purpose. However, false-positive recall rates vary according to age, breast density, and&#xD;
      postmenopausal hormonal therapy, among other. For women with dense breasts, the accuracy of&#xD;
      mammography is decreased. Circulating serum marker for monitoring of BC have been in&#xD;
      development for several decades. Conventional tumor markers, such as cancer antigen 15-3&#xD;
      (CA15-3), carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA)), and circulating tumor cell count (CTC), are&#xD;
      clinically available, however, their usefulness is mostly limited to patients with advanced&#xD;
      and metastatic BC (MBC). Hence, there is a need for developing new biomarkers which can be&#xD;
      used as valuable tools in identifying high risk patients, to predict disease prognosis and&#xD;
      thus have an impact in patient management.Cell free DNA (cfDNA) are short fragments of&#xD;
      nucleic acids present in the circulation. Multiple studies also have indicated elevated&#xD;
      levels of cf DNA in breast cancer. The ALU(Arthrobacter luteus) sequences were chosen, as&#xD;
      they are the most abundant and active repeated elements in the human genome, typically 300&#xD;
      nucleotides in length, accounting for more than 10% of the genome. DNA integrity was&#xD;
      calculated as the ratio of (ALU247/ALU115). As the annealing sites of ALU115 are within the&#xD;
      ALU247 annealing sites, thus the ratio of ALU247 to ALU115 is termed as DNA integrity. It&#xD;
      characterizes the fragmentation pattern of circulating cell free DNA. The DNA integrity is&#xD;
      &quot;1&quot; if template DNA is not truncated and &quot;0&quot; if DNA is completely truncated to fragments&#xD;
      smaller than 247 bp (base pair). Thus it has been assessed for its diagnostic and prognostic&#xD;
      potential role in breast cancer patients&#xD;
