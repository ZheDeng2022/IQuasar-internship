  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Almost 50 % of papillary thyroid cancer (PTC) patients have central lymph node metastases&#xD;
      (CLNM), which are associated with a high risk of persistent or recurrent disease. However,&#xD;
      the practice of performing a prophylactic central lymph node dissection (PCLND) routinely&#xD;
      remains controversial. The proponents argue that without a PCLND, PTC patients with positive&#xD;
      lymph nodes have an increased risk of local recurrence, and postponed node dissection leads&#xD;
      to with 5-6 fold higher risk of morbidity. If performed, PCLND in clinical node negative&#xD;
      patients increases staging to pN1 in more than 50% of the cases without increasing survival.&#xD;
      The complication rate in PCLND is lower when compared to a technically challenging&#xD;
      re-exploration in recurrent disease, with reported incidences of 0.6% and 7.3-20%,&#xD;
      respectively. Opponents of routine PCLND point out the lack of randomized clinical trials and&#xD;
      object to treatment-induced hypo-parathyroidism and recurrent nerve damage for the N0&#xD;
      patients. Currently, no diagnostic tool is available which reliably identifies these patient&#xD;
      categories. Therefore, there is a clear need for novel diagnostic imaging modalities that&#xD;
      overcome this issue. Molecular Fluorescence Guided Surgery (MFGS) is potentially such a&#xD;
      diagnostic tool. The administration of NIR fluorescent tracers can increase detection&#xD;
      accuracy of cancer and nodal metastatic tissue using macroscopic MFGS. Therefore, we aimed to&#xD;
      identify a GMP-produced near infrared (NIR) tracer that potentially has a high&#xD;
      target-to-background ratio in PTC compared to normal thyroid tissue. Tyrosine-protein kinase&#xD;
      Met (c-Met) is significantly upregulated at the protein level in PTC compared to normal&#xD;
      thyroid tissue. The investigators therefore hypothesize that the GMP-produced NIR-fluorescent&#xD;
      tracer EMI-137 (targeting c-Met, peak emission at 675 nm range) might be useful for&#xD;
      intraoperative imaging of PTC and nodal metastases. The investigators' aim is to investigate&#xD;
      if the administration of EMI-137 is a feasible approach to detect PTC nodal metastases.&#xD;
      Ultimately, this method might be useful to improve patient selection for CLND. Eventually, we&#xD;
      might also be able to visualize multifocality, more selective lateral neck dissections and&#xD;
      asses residual tissue after thyroidectomy. Ultimately, all of these strategies may reduce&#xD;
      overtreatment, morbidity, and costs while maintaining the same or better effectiveness with a&#xD;
      lower recurrence rate and improved quality of life.&#xD;
