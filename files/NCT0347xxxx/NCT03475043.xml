  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Millions of elderly adults in the USA have age related hearing loss (ARHL), a malady that&#xD;
      affects half of adults 60-69 years, and the majority of older adults. This hearing loss not&#xD;
      only impacts communication and functional ability, but also is strongly associated with&#xD;
      cognitive decline and decreased quality of life. This project aims to develop effective&#xD;
      strategies to compensate and reverse this process through a deeper understanding of&#xD;
      plasticity and adaptive auditory function, and how to engage it and harness it to remedy&#xD;
      ARHL.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The detrimental effects of aging on auditory temporal processing have been well documented in&#xD;
      humans and animal models. At present, there are gaps in knowledge of the extent to which&#xD;
      these auditory temporal processing deficits can be mitigated in older adults with or without&#xD;
      hearing loss through auditory training and neuroplasticity, to improve precision of neural&#xD;
      timing and speech understanding. The long-term goal is to determine the extent to which&#xD;
      hearing deficits in older adults can be ameliorated with auditory training. The investigators&#xD;
      propose an innovative approach to the investigation of aging, hearing, and neuroplasticity by&#xD;
      marrying perceptual training experiments with electrophysiological measurements. The&#xD;
      objectives are to compare young normal-hearing (YNH), older normal-hearing (ONH), and older&#xD;
      hearing-impaired (OHI) adult listeners, and evaluate the improvements in perceptual and&#xD;
      electrophysiological measures of temporal processing after explicit training on auditory&#xD;
      temporal processing tasks. The central hypothesis is that training of auditory temporal&#xD;
      processing will produce concomitant improvements in both perceptual performance and neural&#xD;
      encoding, which will close the gap in the age-related differences between groups. The central&#xD;
      hypothesis will be tested by pursuing two specific aims: (Aim 1) Determine the extent to&#xD;
      which perceptual training on temporal rate discrimination using simple non-speech stimuli&#xD;
      improves perceptual and neural encoding in YNH, ONH, and OHI listeners; and (Aim 2) Determine&#xD;
      the extent to which perceptual training on the processing of sentences with increasing&#xD;
      presentation rate can improve behavioral performance and neural encoding in YNH, ONH, and OHI&#xD;
      listeners. The expected outcomes are that the investigators will learn what perceptual&#xD;
      training tasks lead to simultaneous improvements in perceptual and neural auditory temporal&#xD;
      processing and the findings will produce a significant impact in older listeners who&#xD;
      experience difficulty in communicating in daily life because they will lead directly to&#xD;
      focused and novel forms of rehabilitation. This research is innovative because the&#xD;
      investigators will have established techniques that are proven to provide significant&#xD;
      improvements in auditory temporal processing and speech perception, combined with evidence of&#xD;
      improvements to neural encoding. These studies will serve the larger goals of the program&#xD;
      project grant because they will help identify the neuroplastic mechanisms in the brain of&#xD;
      humans that correspond to successful behavioral outcomes in younger and older adults.&#xD;
