      A prospective qualitative and quantitative controlled study, exploring the impact of patient&#xD;
      centred digital prescriptions on health, in patients with chronic health conditions.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      ScalaMed is an innovative new consumer centred solution for securing prescriptions through a&#xD;
      blockchain solution - a cryptographic distributed database, that can give consumer access to&#xD;
      their prescriptions at all times. It aims to solve interoperability challenges that exist in&#xD;
      healthcare, by creating a ledger of prescriptions, and giving consumers access to this&#xD;
      information to own and share as they need. The solution will be accessed through an&#xD;
      application available on a smart phone, will be fully compliant with security and privacy&#xD;
      laws, and will be made available to consumers, clinicians, and pharmacies enrolled in this&#xD;
      study free of charge. The system also allows patients to monitor the usage of their&#xD;
      prescriptions - eg when they need a new one, and allows them to choose how and where they&#xD;
      want to use their prescriptions like with paper.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will explore whether empowering consumers with their digital prescriptions in a&#xD;
      digital format through a blockchain based methodology of storing and accessing their data,&#xD;
      will improve the flow of clinically important information, improve the frequency of data&#xD;
      sharing, improve the self-management of the patient, improve adherence to treatments, reduce&#xD;
      interactions and adverse events associated with medications, reduce the burden on clinical&#xD;
      practice, improve efficiency, reduce the amount of paper, increase consumer engagement and&#xD;
      improve patient satisfaction.&#xD;
