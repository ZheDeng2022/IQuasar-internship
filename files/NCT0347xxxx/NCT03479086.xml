  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To compare the clinical effectiveness, tolerability, and cost-effectiveness of topiramate to&#xD;
      active control (naltrexone) on treatment outcomes for alcohol dependence in a double-blind&#xD;
      randomised controlled trial.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Clinicians urgently require new treatment strategies for the treatment of alcohol dependence.&#xD;
      Although alcohol use disorders are a leading cause of preventable death in Australia, their&#xD;
      treatment is generally not evidence based. The medications currently approved for use in&#xD;
      Australia for the management of alcohol dependence have limited efficacy, and existing&#xD;
      research does not address the heterogeneity of treatment response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Targeted personalised medicine addresses this heterogeneity with better medicine selection&#xD;
      for patients based on their genotype and clinical comorbidities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Members of our research team have recently demonstrated findings that support the use of&#xD;
      topiramate (TOP) 200 mg/day to reduce heavy drinking and pharmacogenetic findings that&#xD;
      implicate the GluK1 receptor subunit in the mechanism of these effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This project will evaluate the clinical effectiveness and tolerability of topiramate relative&#xD;
      to the active control naltrexone (NTX) in heavy drinkers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators hypothesise that topiramate treated patients will be better able to achieve a&#xD;
      reduction in heavy drinking and predict that, based on prior research, that the effects would&#xD;
      be moderated by a single nucleotide polymorphism (rs2832407) in GRIK1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research personnel will utilise an innovative prospective pharmacogenetic randomisation&#xD;
      approach to a double-blind, randomised, controlled trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Individuals will receive 12 weeks of titrated treatment with topiramate (200 mg/day) or&#xD;
      naltrexone (50mg/day) and medical management.&#xD;
