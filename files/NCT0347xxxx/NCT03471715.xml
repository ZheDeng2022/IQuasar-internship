      **Data Collection:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following data of the current retrospective study will be collected from the recruited&#xD;
      CBCT images:-&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Demographic data:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Age and Sex will be drawn from the patients' CBCT files.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Variables:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Outcome: Frequency of root fenestration and dehiscence at different teeth types in adult&#xD;
           Egyptian population sample using CBCT.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Radiographic examination was done at the Oral and Maxillofacial Radiology Department,&#xD;
           Faculty of Dentistry, Cairo University using CBCT machine, Planmeca Promax 3D Mid&#xD;
           (Finland) .&#xD;
&#xD;
           Root fenestration (RF) will be identified according to the definition of Davies et al.&#xD;
           19 and the American Association of Endodontists 20 as a tooth root protruding from a&#xD;
           window-like opening or a defect in the alveolar bone without involvement of the alveolar&#xD;
           margin. Three points should be emphasized in this definition. 1- A window-like opening&#xD;
           or defect of the alveolar bone means that both the cortical bone and the cancellous bone&#xD;
           are penetrated simultaneously, and the root either is in direct contact with the&#xD;
           overlying mucosa or exposed to the oral environment. 2- The exposed root protrudes&#xD;
           beyond the bone. 3- The exclusion of the alveolar margin emphasized to differentiate&#xD;
           fenestration from dehiscence. While dehiscence will be identified as the crest of buccal&#xD;
           and lingual bone that lies at least 4mm apical to the crest of interproximal bone.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The identification and measurements of the alveolar bone level will be made on CBCT&#xD;
           cross sectional images that are corrected to be with the long axis of each tooth under&#xD;
           examination.&#xD;
&#xD;
           All assessment will be done by two examiners to eliminate the inter-examiner error. All&#xD;
           data regarding patient identification will be kept confidential.&#xD;
&#xD;
           **Participants: Eligibility criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Inclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
                • CBCT scans of Adult Egyptian population with age range from 18 to 60 years old.&#xD;
&#xD;
                • The CBCT scans should fully show both maxillary and mandibular teeth with the&#xD;
                surrounding alveolar bone.&#xD;
&#xD;
                • Permanent teeth with complete development of roots only are included.&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  CBCT scans for both partially and fully dentated people are included.&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  Lack of large pathological lesion.&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  Lack of fracture either in teeth or alveolar bone.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Exclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
                • CBCT scans of People younger than 18 or older than 60 years old.&#xD;
&#xD;
                • CBCT scans showing only single jaw.&#xD;
&#xD;
                • CBCT scans completely edentulous people.&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  Teeth with incomplete root development are excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  Teeth with unclear alveolar crest around it due to metallic artifacts from&#xD;
                     nearby restoration.&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  Presence of large pathological lesions.&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  Fractured teeth or alveolar process.&#xD;
&#xD;
                       -  Sources:&#xD;
&#xD;
                CBCT images will be obtained from patient's database at the Department of Oral and&#xD;
                Maxillofacial Radiology, Faculty of Dentistry, Cairo University.&#xD;
&#xD;
                **Methods of selection: The sample will be selected by random manual means from&#xD;
                database of Promax 3D Mid machine.&#xD;
&#xD;
                **Bias: Investigators are going to be blinded about patients' age and gender prior&#xD;
                to scans interpretation.&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  Blinding/Masking:&#xD;
&#xD;
                After recruitment of images, a volunteering radiologist will perform coding of the&#xD;
                images and clinical data. All investigators will be blinded of the data collected.&#xD;
                The main investigator will evaluate the images twice with two weeks interval&#xD;
                between the two reading sessions, while second investigator will evaluate it once.&#xD;
                Inter-observational and intra-observational variability between the observers will&#xD;
                be statistically evaluated.&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  Statistical Considerations:&#xD;
&#xD;
                SAMPLE SIZE ESTIMATION This study is designed to determine the frequency of root&#xD;
                fenestration and dehiscence at different teeth types in a sample of adult Egyptian&#xD;
                population using CBCT. Based on previous study by Enhos et al (2012)13, Buyuk et al&#xD;
                (2016) 21 and Gambarini et al (2017)15, the weighted average expected frequency of&#xD;
                fenestration and dehiscence of the three studies are 7.0 % for fenestration and 4.8&#xD;
                % for dehiscence. A total sample size of 100 cases will be needed to provide a&#xD;
                two-sided 95% confidence interval for a single proportion using the large sample&#xD;
                normal approximation and will extend 5% from the observed proportion for an&#xD;
                expected proportion of 0.07. Sample size estimation was performed by Epi info&#xD;
                statistical package.&#xD;
&#xD;
                STATISTICAL METHODS Data will be analyzed using IBM SPSS advanced statistics&#xD;
                (Statistical Package for Social Sciences), version 23 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL). The&#xD;
                estimation of the frequency of fenestration and dehiscence in a sample of the adult&#xD;
                Egyptian population will be described as numbers and percentages. The 95%&#xD;
                confidence intervals for all estimates will be calculated&#xD;
