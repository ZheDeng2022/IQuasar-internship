  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Full ambulatory polysomnography at home performed two nights in 30 healthy children and one&#xD;
      night in 30 children with mono-symptomatic nocturnal enuresis (15 with polyuria and 15&#xD;
      without polyuria). The children will be aged 7-14 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sleep will be evaluated on sleep quality, number of periodic limb movements per hour,&#xD;
      blood pressure and pulse, beat to beat variation by electrocardiography during sleep,&#xD;
      respiration during sleep, nocturnal urine production, and enuresis episodes.&#xD;

      Purpose and perspectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of the study is to investigate the quality of sleep, the sleep architecture and&#xD;
      the intra-individual variation from night to night in healthy children and children with&#xD;
      mono-symptomatic nocturnal enuresis (MNE) using full polysomnography at home.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypotheses:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  There is large intra-individual night to night variation in sleep quality and&#xD;
           architecture.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Children with MNE have different sleep architecture than healthy children when looking&#xD;
           at sleep quality and arousals.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Periodic limp movements at sleep is more frequent in children with MNE than in healthy&#xD;
           children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is a case-control study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Materials and methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will recruit 30 healthy children and 30 children with MNE (15 with polyuria and 15&#xD;
      without polyuria) recruited from the Childrens Incontinence Center at the Department of&#xD;
      Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine at Aarhus University Hospital. Children of both sexes aged&#xD;
      between 7 and 14 years of age will be enrolled. Children and their parents will be informed&#xD;
      about the study both verbally and in written. Written informed consent from both parents must&#xD;
      be obtained before the children can be enrolled in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The healthy children will go through two nights of full polysomnography to be able to view&#xD;
      intra-individual changes. The children with MNE will only have to do one night of&#xD;
      polysomnography.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary parameters:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Sleep quality&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Number of periodic limb movements per hour&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood pressure and pulse&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Beat to beat variation by electrocardiography during sleep&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Respiration during sleep&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Nocturnal urine production&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Enuresis episodes&#xD;
