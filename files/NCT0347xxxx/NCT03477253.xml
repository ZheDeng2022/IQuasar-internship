  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study was aimed to assess the outcome of laparoscopic cholecystectomy in acute calculous&#xD;
      cholecystitis in terms of conversion rates, postoperative complications and length of&#xD;
      hospital stay within and after 3 days of symptoms onset.&#xD;

      The study aims to evaluate the safety and competency of laparoscopic cholecystectomy as&#xD;
      surgical management of acute calculous cholecystitis within and after 72h of symptom onset.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study included 62 patients with acute calculous cholecystitis. Patients are divided into&#xD;
      2 study groups by the time of laparoscopic cholecystectomy comparing to the onset of symptoms&#xD;
      and categorized as Group A &amp; B. Immediate laparoscopic cholecystectomy is performed in Group&#xD;
      A. while late laparoscopic cholecystectomy is performed in Group B. Patients in both groups&#xD;
      monitored since admission, during operations, and along the postoperative period.&#xD;
