  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to determine the efficacy of a product combining the probiotic&#xD;
      Lactobacillus GG and chamomile in treating infantile colic in exclusively breast fed infants.&#xD;
      The study will be performed as a 4 week, placebo controlled, pilot trial with a one week run&#xD;
      in period. Thirty subjects will be randomly assigned to each group for a total enrollment of&#xD;
      60 infants.&#xD;

      The study will be performed as a 4 week, placebo controlled, pilot trial with a one week run&#xD;
      in period. Thirty participants will be randomly assigned to each group for a total enrollment&#xD;
      of 60 participants. Participants will be recruited from the Children's' Hospital &amp; Medical&#xD;
      Center's Pediatrician's group. The study coordinators and Investigators will conduct&#xD;
      informational lunches at selected pediatrician offices in the Omaha area. The investigators&#xD;
      will introduce the topic of the colic study to participants seen for routine follow up who&#xD;
      the investigators suspect may meet the diagnostic criteria for colic. The study coordinator&#xD;
      will then contact the participants and assess suitability with a brief phone questionnaire.&#xD;
      If participants appear to qualify and the participant is agreeable an enrollment appointment&#xD;
      will be made to sign the consent, education on the product and how to administer it, teaching&#xD;
      regarding diary instrument and completion of the quality of life survey. A brief medical&#xD;
      history including the delivery mode and family allergy history will be collected as well as&#xD;
      weight and length of the infant at the consent visit. A subset of participants will be asked&#xD;
      to provide a stool sample for analysis of calprotectin level (a marker of intestinal&#xD;
      inflammation) if the participants are willing to provide this. Participants will administer 5&#xD;
      drops of the study product once a day with a feeding at mid-day. Participants will be&#xD;
      instructed to record crying time for a 1 week run in period and then administer the provided&#xD;
      drops as directed once a day and record daily crying time on 3 days each week for 4&#xD;
      subsequent weeks. A follow up phone call 2 weeks after starting the product will be conducted&#xD;
      to ensure compliance and assess for any adverse events. A final visit after 4 weeks will be&#xD;
      conducted for collection of the diary data, completion of the quality of life survey,&#xD;
      obtainment of the infant's length and weight and collection of a follow up stool sample if&#xD;
      the provided one at baseline.&#xD;
