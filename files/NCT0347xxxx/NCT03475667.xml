  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Inaccurate monitoring of mean arterial pressure (MAP) could lead to improper treatment in the&#xD;
      form of excessive fluid infusion or unnecessary vasopressor therapy; therefore, accurate&#xD;
      hemodynamic monitoring is crucial in treatment of septic shock.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In critically ill septic patients treated with vasoactive drugs, many studies reported that&#xD;
      radial arterial pressure monitoring significantly underestimates central arterial pressure.&#xD;
      Insertion of a femoral line allowed a substantial reduction of the infusion rate of&#xD;
      vasoactive drugs in these patients. These findings might imply that femoral placement of&#xD;
      arterial lines is the gold standard for invasive arterial blood pressure monitoring in shock&#xD;
      patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our study aimed to determine the difference between radial (peripheral) and femoral (central)&#xD;
      arterial pressures measured simultaneously in a group of critically ill patients receiving&#xD;
      high dose noradrenaline therapy (≥ 0.1 mcg/kg/min).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Invasive arterial blood pressure monitoring is common in critically ill patients admitted in&#xD;
      intensive care units (ICUs). The most common indication for invasive arterial blood pressure&#xD;
      monitoring is for continuous measurement in hemodynamically unstable patients on vasopressor&#xD;
      therapies Invasive arterial blood pressure monitoring is a standard of care during shock&#xD;
      management in the ICU. The Surviving Sepsis Campaign international consensus guidelines&#xD;
      (2016) recommend maintaining a mean arterial pressure (MAP) of 65 mmHg or greater, as a goal&#xD;
      of initial resuscitation, and to apply vasopressors, if required, to maintain MAP at this&#xD;
      level. The radial artery is most commonly used, with the femoral artery being the second&#xD;
      choice; both site accounting as 92% of all arterial cannulations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Accuracy of invasive blood pressure monitoring is crucial in evaluating the cardiocirculatory&#xD;
      system and adjusting vasopressor therapy for hemodynamic support. However, the best site for&#xD;
      catheter insertion is controversial. Compared with arterial pressure waveforms measured in&#xD;
      the central arteries (eg, aorta or femoral artery), those at the periphery (eg, radial&#xD;
      artery) characteristically have steeper upstrokes, higher systolic peaks, a later appearing&#xD;
      diastolic notch, more prominent diastolic waves and lower end-diastolic pressure. Yet, under&#xD;
      normal physiological conditions, only a negligible decrement in MAP occurs. In critically ill&#xD;
      patients during aberrant hemodynamic conditions like septic shock, gradients in MAP may&#xD;
      develop from the central to the peripheral arterial site.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are some available studies where simultaneous measurement of radial and femoral was&#xD;
      done in different patient population. In all studies where patients of cardiopulmonary bypass&#xD;
      were included showed that there was significant difference in MAP and SBP between femoral and&#xD;
      radial invasive blood pressure measurements with femoral site IBP being greater than radial&#xD;
      site. Similar difference in SBP and MAP was noted in reperfusion stage of liver transplant&#xD;
      patients. The difference was also found in septic shock patients in MAP with vasopressor&#xD;
      usage but one study did not find significant difference in invasive MAP and SBP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Work plan methodology:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a prospective observational study to know the difference in blood pressure recordings&#xD;
      of invasive arterial BP (radial versus femoral site) in patients of septic shock on high dose&#xD;
      of noradrenaline therapy (≥0.1 mcg/kg/min) for at least 30 minutes. Participant will be&#xD;
      included from ICU of department of critical care medicine. All adult critically ill patients&#xD;
      with septic shock requiring noradrenaline infusion (≥0.1 mcg/kg/min) will be considered for&#xD;
      inclusion in this study. Participant will be included if treating team considered to change&#xD;
      the site of arterial invasive blood pressure monitoring from radial to femoral site (same&#xD;
      side, left or right).&#xD;
&#xD;
      All three measurements: systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP) and&#xD;
      mean blood pressure (MAP) will be recorded three times, simultaneously on the monitor within&#xD;
      5 minutes of placement of femoral arterial catheter by freezing/taking snapshot of the&#xD;
      monitor. Measurement will be recorded in supine position, with radial arterial line&#xD;
      transducer at the level of 5th rib in mid-axillary line. Femoral line transducer will be&#xD;
      placed at the same level as radial line transducer; the equality of the levels of both the&#xD;
      transducers will be confirmed with the help of spirit level technique. Investigators will use&#xD;
      20 gauge arterial cannula for radial artery cannulation and 16 gauge single lumen catheters&#xD;
      for femoral artery cannulation with all aseptic precautions. Participant with any change in&#xD;
      noradrenaline dose requirement during study period (measurement of pressures) will be&#xD;
      excluded from the analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size and statistical analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      From the previous observational study considering minimum average difference of mean MAP of&#xD;
      2.8 mm of Hg, investigators calculated the sample size with power analysis by using version&#xD;
      2008 (PASS-8). A sample size of 44 achieves 90% power to detect a mean of paired differences&#xD;
      of 2.8 with an estimated standard deviation of differences of 5.6 and with a significance&#xD;
      level (alpha) of 0.05 using a two-sided paired t-test. In this study, investigators would&#xD;
      also like to do the subgroup analysis in patients on very high dose of noradrenaline (≥0.3&#xD;
      mcg/kg/min). So, investigators will include 80 patients. Mean of three recordings each of&#xD;
      SBP, DBP and MBP will be calculated and appropriate statistical methods will be applied&#xD;
&#xD;
