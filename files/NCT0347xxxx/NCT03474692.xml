      The purpose of this registry is to establish a research data repository, comprised of data&#xD;
      generated in the course of providing clinical services to patients treated by Virta Health,&#xD;
      to conduct secondary research on clinical interventions and chronic diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The scope of research under this protocol includes the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Examining the effectiveness, safety, and sustainability of Virta Health clinical&#xD;
           interventions for treating chronic diseases and prevention of or regression of&#xD;
           associated adverse health outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Examining the cost-effectiveness and economic impact of Virta Health clinical&#xD;
           interventions for treating chronic diseases and preventing or regressing associated&#xD;
           adverse health outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Identifying demographics, clinical characteristics, comorbidities, concomitant&#xD;
           treatments, genetic variants, and behavioral phenotypes that predict more or less&#xD;
           favorable clinical outcomes of subjects to Virta Health clinical interventions for&#xD;
           chronic diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Examining the impact of mental health and the behavioral modification components of&#xD;
           Virta Health clinical interventions on disease markers, comorbidities, and adverse&#xD;
           health outcomes associated with Virta Health clinical interventions.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Characterizing typical presentation patterns, genetic determinants, biochemistry, and&#xD;
           pathophysiology of the chronic diseases treated by Virta Health.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Exploring relationships between dietary composition and physiologic characteristics of&#xD;
           chronic diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Exploring the interrelationship and common clinical/biological features of the various&#xD;
           chronic diseases under treatment by Virta Health.&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. Compiling case reports and case series of interesting disease presentations and&#xD;
           outcomes, of the chronic diseases Virta Health treats, that may inform about the disease&#xD;
           state and treatment responses.&#xD;
&#xD;
        9. Validating the integration of technological aids into Virta Health clinical&#xD;
           interventions. Where the impacts of devices are examined, devices will be FDA-approved&#xD;
           and approved, marketed devices. No safety data will be collected on devices; rather,&#xD;
           research will focus only on the feasibility of adding the device to the treatment&#xD;
           program, its relationship with participant behaviors and health outcomes, and patient&#xD;
           satisfaction attributable to the device.&#xD;
&#xD;
       10. Understanding the relationships of patient needs, educational methods, and use of the&#xD;
           Virta Health online Application, to subsequent patient satisfaction/clinical outcomes.&#xD;
