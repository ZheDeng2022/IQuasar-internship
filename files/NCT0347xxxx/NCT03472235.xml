  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Melasma is an acquired disorder of hyperpigmentation characterised by blotchy, light-to-dark&#xD;
      brown macules distributed symmetrically on the sun-exposed parts of the body.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although many factors have been proposed to have a role in pathogenesis, the exact ethology&#xD;
      is yet to be understood. The most commonly identifiable risk factors include ultraviolet&#xD;
      radiation, genetic predisposition, pregnancy, oral contraceptives, thyroid disease and drugs&#xD;
      like antiepileptic. The excessive pigmentation has been attributed to both melanocytosis&#xD;
      (increased number of melanocytes) as well as melano genesis (excess production of melanin) as&#xD;
      confirmed in a histopathological study on Asian patients.] Furthermore, a vascular component&#xD;
      has also been proposed to play a role in the pathogenesis of melisma. Kim et al. have found&#xD;
      that lesion melasma skin had greater expression of the vascular endothelial growth factor in&#xD;
      keratinocytes compared to nearby nonlesional skin.&#xD;

      As regards management, the therapeutic options range from photoprotection, topical&#xD;
      hypopigmenting agents, chemical peels and lasers. There are variety of less-tried systemic&#xD;
      agents like fish oil, green tea and . Although no single agent has proved to be effective for&#xD;
      all patients, a combination of two or three agents is often tried to achieve optimum results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Chemical peeling is the application of a chemical agent to the skin, which causes the&#xD;
      controlled destruction of a part or of the entire epidermis, with or without the dermis,&#xD;
      leading to exfoliation and removal of superficial lesions, followed by the regeneration of&#xD;
      new epidermal and dermal tissues.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Chemical peels are a well-known modality of treatment for melasma. The basic mechanism of the&#xD;
      action of chemical peels in melasma is the removal of unwanted melanin by causing a&#xD;
      controlled chemical burn to the skin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Trichlroacetic acid peeling has been the gold standard in chemical peeling for many decades.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For superficial peels Trichlroacetic acid 10% to 25% are used. some authors consider up to&#xD;
      35% Trichlroacetic acid as also a superficial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Skin microneedling is a technique predominantly used to improve the appearance of cutaneous&#xD;
      scarring and photo damage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fine needles puncture the skin, resulting in increased dermal elastin and collagen, collagen&#xD;
      remodelling, and thickening of the epidermis and dermis. Additionally, skin needling creates&#xD;
      small channels, which increase the absorption of topically applied preparations A property&#xD;
      which has been used in various dermatological treatments.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>TCA peeling session: Facial skin will be cleansed with tap water and degreased by rubbing with an alcohol sponge .&#xD;
Then TCA 25% will be applied to the whole face by cotton tipped applicator or gauze pad. The entire face will be treated until complete frosting occur.&#xD;
The patients will be instructed to wash their faces to decrease the burning sensation.&#xD;
Combined session: starts with microneedling using microneedling device (Dermapen) The skin of each patient is cleaned with anti septic solution and anesthetic cream may be applied to lessen discomfort.&#xD;
(Dermapen) will be applied on the lesional skin in four direction, vertical, horizontal and in the two diagonal until pin point bleeding occur which will be gently massaged .&#xD;
After 10 minutes TCA peeling will be applied TCA peeling will be done for 8 session with 2 weeks interval between each session.&#xD;
Microneedling will be done for 4session with 4 weeks interval between each session.</intervention_model_description>
