    <textblock>
      The primary objective is to assess the safety and tolerability of Toripalimab in subjects&#xD;
      with various advanced malignancies and to evaluate the recommended Phase 2 dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objectives are to: 1) describe the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of Toripalimab,&#xD;
      2) evaluate antitumor activity of Toripalimab; 3) determine the immunogenicity of&#xD;
      Toripalimab; 4) evaluate overall survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The exploratory objectives are to: 1) evaluate biomarkers that may correlate with activity of&#xD;
      Toripalimab, 2) evaluate pharmacodynamic effects of Toripalimab on its target receptor,&#xD;
      programmed cell death 1 (PD-1), as well as effects on the immune system. 3) evaluate the&#xD;
      utility of PD-L1 &amp; additional exploratory markers as biomarkers that could aid in selection&#xD;
      of appropriate subjects for TAB001 therapy, and 4) identification of additional biomarkers&#xD;
      correlating with response to treatment with TAB001.&#xD;

      OVERVIEW: This is a Phase 1, multi-center, open-label, dose-escalation study of TAB001, a&#xD;
      humanized monoclonal IgG4 antibody targeting the Programmed Death -1 (PD-1). It is estimated&#xD;
      that up to 258 subjects with advanced malignancies will be enrolled in the study. Subjects&#xD;
      must have an advanced solid malignancy that is refractory to standard therapy or for which no&#xD;
      standard therapy exists.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study has 2 parts. In Part A, up to 18 subjects will be enrolled who have not received&#xD;
      prior immunotherapy for their cancer. Three dose levels are planned and include: 80, 240 and&#xD;
      480 mg/dose. Part A will be the traditional 3 + 3 design with 3 or 6 subjects per dose level&#xD;
      (cohort) and will receive their assigned dose every 14 days in the absence of a dose limiting&#xD;
      toxicity (DLT) that would prevent further dosing. Subjects will be assigned to a dose level&#xD;
      in the order of study entry.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If no DLTs occur in a cohort of 3 subjects, a new cohort of 3 subjects will be treated at the&#xD;
      next higher dose level. If 1 of 3 subjects in a dose level experiences a DLT, that dose level&#xD;
      will be expanded to 6 subjects. If only 1 of the 6 subjects has a DLT, then the next cohort&#xD;
      of 3 subjects will be treated at the next higher dose level. If 2 or more DLTs occur within a&#xD;
      cohort, then that dose level will be above the maximum tolerated dose (MTD), and the previous&#xD;
      lower tolerated dose level will be considered the MTD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Part B, up to 240 subjects will be enrolled. Solid tumors may include, but will not be&#xD;
      limited to, esophageal and gastric carcinoma, nasopharyngeal carcinoma, hepatocellular&#xD;
      carcinoma sarcomas, both soft tissue sarcoma (excluding leiomyosarcoma) and chondrosarcoma,&#xD;
      or with agreement of the sponsor, or other tumors that have received at least one line of&#xD;
      therapy in the metastatic setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tumor response will be evaluated using the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors&#xD;
      (RECIST v1.1) and the immune-related Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (irRECIST).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the absence of confirmed disease progression and intolerable toxicities, subjects will be&#xD;
      allowed to continue TAB001 administration every 14 days in Part A or every 21 days in Part B.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION TAB001 doses are 80, 240 and 480 mg in Part A and 240 mg in Part B.&#xD;
      TAB001 will be administered as a 60-minute i.v. infusion for the first 2 doses and may be&#xD;
      decreased at the investigators discretion to 30 minutes in subsequent infusions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SAFETY EVALUATIONS Assessment of safety will be determined by vital sign measurements,&#xD;
      clinical laboratory tests, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status&#xD;
      evaluations, diagnostic imaging, physical examinations, electrocardiograms, and the incidence&#xD;
      and severity of adverse events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety will also include evaluations of immune safety and immunogenicity. Particular&#xD;
      attention will be given to adverse events that may follow enhanced T-cell activation such as&#xD;
      dermatitis and colitis, uveitis, or other immune-related adverse events (irAEs).&#xD;
&#xD;
      An irAE is a clinically significant adverse event of any organ that is associated with drug&#xD;
      exposure, of unknown etiology, and is consistent with an immune-mediated mechanism.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EFFICACY EVALUATIONS will include overall response, disease control, duration of response,&#xD;
      progression free survival, and overall survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PHARMACOKINETIC EVALUATIONS Pharmacokinetic parameters include AUC, Cmax, CL, Vd and t½z.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STATISTICAL METHODS The sample size for this study is not determined from power analysis. In&#xD;
      Part A, it is based on the 3+3 design for dose escalation and safety evaluation requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Descriptive statistics will include: mean, standard deviation, median, and minimum and&#xD;
      maximum values for continuous variables; frequencies and percentages for categorical&#xD;
      variables.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The efficacy parameters will be summarized using descriptive statistics. All safety and&#xD;
      pharmacokinetic parameters will be summarized using descriptive statistics.&#xD;
