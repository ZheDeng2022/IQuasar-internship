  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Specific aims are as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To adapt our existing CBT4CBT program for use with Spanish-speaking alcohol users in a&#xD;
           web-based platform&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To conduct an 8-week randomized trial evaluating the feasibility and efficacy of adding&#xD;
           CBT4CBT-Spanish to treatment as usual in a community based treatment program in a&#xD;
           population of 90 Spanish-speaking individuals who meet current criteria for alcohol use&#xD;
           disorder&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the long-term durability and/or delayed emergence of treatment effects&#xD;
           through a six month follow-up after termination of the study treatments. Given previous&#xD;
           evidence regarding the durability of standard clinician-delivered CBT and&#xD;
           computer-assisted CBT4CBT, we hypothesize that CBT4CBTSpanish will be significantly more&#xD;
           effective than standard treatment alone through the follow-up.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators will conduct a Stage 1 randomized clinical trial evaluating the program in&#xD;
      which 90 Spanish-speaking individuals with alcohol use disorder will be randomized to (1)&#xD;
      standard outpatient counseling at the Hispanic Clinic (ST; typically consisting of weekly&#xD;
      individual and group supportive counseling) or (2) CBT4CBT-Spanish as an adjunct to ST. Other&#xD;
      aspects of the trial will parallel those in the investogators completed trial of the English&#xD;
      version of CBT4CBT-Alcohol to facilitate comparability across studies. Treatments will be&#xD;
      delivered over an 8-week period with a 6-month follow-up to assess durability and/or delayed&#xD;
      emergence of treatment effects. The primary outcome measure will be percent days of&#xD;
      abstinence (PDA) by week. Secondary outcomes include percent heavy drinking days and number&#xD;
      of individuals with no heavy drinking days in the last 4 weeks of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be 90 individuals seeking treatment for alcohol use at the Hispanic Clinic&#xD;
      of CMHC. The clinic treats a heterogeneous population, where 42% of those in the co-occurring&#xD;
      treatment program report alcohol as their principal substance related issue and 43% are&#xD;
      women. As reported above, the investigators have demonstrated the ability to recruit,&#xD;
      randomize, retain, and follow-up high numbers of closely related samples in this setting.&#xD;

Participants will have access the CBT4CBT website in Spanish as an add-on to treatment. In this treatment participants will work with a computerized program that teaches skills for stopping alcohol use and increasing coping skills, such as how to understand patterns of alcohol use, how to cope with cravings for alcohol, how to refuse offers of alcohol, and so on.</description>
