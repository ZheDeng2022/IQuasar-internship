      The primary objective of the Sleep and Stent II is to determine the prevalence of REM-OSA in&#xD;
      DM versus non-DM patients undergoing clinically indicated PCI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objectives are to investigate the association between REM-AHI and (1) cardiac&#xD;
      arrhythmia based on ambulatory ECG monitoring, (2) excessive daytime sleepiness, and (3)&#xD;
      glycemic control in patients with DM.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, we will determine the prevalence of REM-OSA based on alternative definitions,&#xD;
      including (a) overall AHI at least 5 with AHI REM/AHI NREM ratio at least 2; (b) overall AHI&#xD;
      at least 5 with AHI REM/AHI NREM ratio at least 2 and with AHI NREM &lt; 15; (c) overall AHI at&#xD;
      least 5, AHI REM/AHI NREM ratio at least 2 and with AHI NREM &lt; 8.&#xD;

      The Sleep and Stent II is a cross-sectional study of patients who have undergone PCI for&#xD;
      coronary artery disease. A total of 200 adult patients who have undergone clinically&#xD;
      indicated PCI between 6 and 36 months ago are eligible. The study involves the 2 national&#xD;
      heart centers and the Ng Teng Fong General Hospital in Singapore (3 centers in total). The&#xD;
      National University Heart Center Singapore is the leading center and it is responsible for&#xD;
      the overall study design and study conduct. The estimated duration of the Sleep and Stent II&#xD;
      is 3 years (2018-2020).&#xD;
&#xD;
      All subjects and/or their legally authorized representative must provide written informed&#xD;
      consent before any study-related procedure can be conducted. The patients will be divided&#xD;
      into DM and non-DM groups, and the two groups will be matched for age, sex, and BMI. As a&#xD;
      standard clinical practice in Singapore, patients who have undergone PCI will be followed up&#xD;
      at the outpatient clinic for continuation of care. As such, the recruitment will be conducted&#xD;
      at the outpatient clinic. All recruited patients will undergo an overnight polysomnography at&#xD;
      the National University Health System Cardiosleep research laboratory.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All polysomnography studies will be conducted using a standardized level I diagnostic device&#xD;
      (Embla RemLogic, Natus Medical Inc. Canada). Outputs recorded from the portable diagnostic&#xD;
      device will be manually scored by an independent sleep technologist with Registered&#xD;
      Polysomnographic Technologist credentials, blinded to the patients' clinical characteristics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary measure of the polysomnography will be the AHI, quantified as the total number of&#xD;
      apneas and hypopneas per hour of sleep. An apnea is defined as a 90% or greater decrease in&#xD;
      airflow from the baseline value for at least 10 seconds. Apneas are further classified as&#xD;
      obstructive or central based on the presence or absence, respectively, of respiratory-related&#xD;
      chest wall movement. Hypopnea is defined as a 30-90% reduction in airflow from the baseline&#xD;
      value lasting 10 seconds or more, in conjunction with â‰¥3% oxygen desaturation. The&#xD;
      respiratory event scoring will be performed according to the American Academy of Sleep&#xD;
      Medicine guidelines. For all patients the AHI during total sleep time, the AHI during REM&#xD;
      (AHI-REM), and the AHI during non-REM sleep (AHI-NREM) will be calculated. REM OSA is defined&#xD;
      in a variety of ways including AHI at least 5 withAHI-REM/AHI-NREM ratio at least 2; overall&#xD;
      AHI at least 5 with AHI-REM/ AHI-NREM ratio at least 2 and with AHI-NREM less than 15;&#xD;
      overall AHI at least 5, AHI-REM/AHI-NREM ratio at least 2 and with AHI-NREM less than 8.&#xD;
