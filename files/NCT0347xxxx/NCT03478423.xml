      Background: Emergency department (ED) providers are frequently challenged with how best to&#xD;
      treat acute pain, specifically when non-opioid analgesics are insufficient or&#xD;
      contraindicated. Studies have documented older patients presenting to the ED with painful&#xD;
      conditions are less likely to receive pain medications than younger patients, and this&#xD;
      inadequate pain control has been associated with increased risk of delirium and longer&#xD;
      hospital stays. Given the concerns for drug interactions, adverse side effects, over-sedation&#xD;
      and addiction; emergency physicians often report uncertainty regarding the ideal choice of&#xD;
      opioid analgesic in older adults. There are no guidelines informing best practice for the&#xD;
      management of acute pain in this population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: The primary objective is to compare the efficacy of codeine, oxycodone and&#xD;
      hydromorphone for acute fracture pain in patients discharged from the ED.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: This will be a blinded, randomized controlled trial of adults (age â‰¥ 18) discharged&#xD;
      home from the ED with acute pain secondary to an upper extremity, lower extremity, rib,&#xD;
      pelvic or vertebral compression fracture. Patients will be randomized to receive a 3-day&#xD;
      supply of codeine, oxycodone or hydromorphone. Patients will also be given acetaminophen.&#xD;
      Patients will be contacted by phone or email 3 days following their ED visit. The primary&#xD;
      outcome will be differences in pain scores at 3 days assessed using the validated Brief Pain&#xD;
      Inventory (Short Form). Secondary outcomes will include side effects (ie: confusion,&#xD;
      constipation), adverse events (i.e, falls, healthcare visits) and pain interference with&#xD;
      daily activity. Patients, physicians and all research staff will be blinded to group&#xD;
      allocation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Importance: All analgesics (including opioids) prescribed to adults are associated with an&#xD;
      increased risk of adverse events. This study seeks to inform ED providers of opioid efficacy,&#xD;
      side effects and patient-important, functional outcomes in this growing patient population.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Introduction :Pain is a major symptom of many patients presenting to the emergency department&#xD;
      (ED), with up to 42% of ED visits being related to painful conditions. ED providers are&#xD;
      challenged with how best to treat acute pain, specifically when non-opioid analgesics are&#xD;
      ineffective or contraindicated. There is considerable debate regarding most appropriate&#xD;
      choice of analgesic when treating acute pain. Providers seek to prescribe the most effective&#xD;
      analgesic with the least side effects, including the least risk of opioid dependence. Factors&#xD;
      contributing to debate around the most appropriate opioid analgesic have also been influenced&#xD;
      by pharmaceutical industry marketing and health care systems' efforts to improve clinicians'&#xD;
      treatment of pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ontario's most commonly prescribed opioid is codeine. Yet, its utilization as an analgesic is&#xD;
      debated in the analgesic literature. Codeine is a prodrug that is metabolized to morphine in&#xD;
      the liver. In most people, 5% to 10% of codeine is converted to morphine. Thus, some experts&#xD;
      suggest that a 30 mg dose of codeine is considered equivalent to a 3 mg dose of morphine.&#xD;
      However, other experts in this area suggest equi-analgesic doses of opioids are equally&#xD;
      efficacious in relieving pain. In fact, codeine has been compared to hydrocodone using&#xD;
      morphine-equivalent doses and were found equally efficacious at relieving pain the ED in a&#xD;
      randomized controlled trial. Two additional randomized controlled trials have compared short&#xD;
      acting hydrocodone and short acting oxycodone found them to be equally effective to relieve&#xD;
      pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Another recent study by Chang et al., reported no statistically significant or clinically&#xD;
      important differences in pain reduction at 2 hours after single-dose treatment with ibuprofen&#xD;
      and acetaminophen or with 3 different opioid and acetaminophen combination analgesics for&#xD;
      patients presenting to the ED with acute extremity pain. The largest difference in decline in&#xD;
      mean pain score between any two treatments was 0.9 at the 2-hour time point, a difference&#xD;
      that was not statistically significant and was less than 1.3, which was the author's a priori&#xD;
      criterion to define a minimal clinically important difference in pain. This study had several&#xD;
      limitations including the limited follow-up time of 2 hours, lack of adverse event reporting,&#xD;
      and the exclusion of patients over the age of 65 years. This study is one of the only&#xD;
      published randomized trials evaluating analgesic efficacy of opioid and non-opioid analgesics&#xD;
      for an acutely painful condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is a surprising paucity of studies evaluating analgesic efficacy, particularly after ED&#xD;
      discharge, and there are no guidelines informing best practice for the management of acute&#xD;
      pain following ED disposition for acute pain. To date, there have not been studies directly&#xD;
      comparing the 3 most commonly prescribed opioids in Canadian EDs: codeine, hydromorphone and&#xD;
      oxycodone. In light of mounting concern about the misuse of oral opioids, studies are needed&#xD;
      to inform policy makers and to assist physicians in making evidence-based decisions about&#xD;
      optimal short-term outpatient pain management.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There remains a paucity of data informing ED providers of opioid efficacy and patient&#xD;
      important, functional outcomes in adults. Therefore, the objective of this study is to&#xD;
      identify a preferred prescribed oral opioid analgesic for outpatient pain management among&#xD;
      adults presenting to the ED with an acutely painful condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      reater pharmacodynamic sensitivity to analgesic central nervous system effects. Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To identify the most effective prescribed oral opioid analgesic for outpatient pain&#xD;
      management among adults presenting to the emergency department with an acutely painful&#xD;
      condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To describe analgesic use, side effects, adverse events and patient-important, functional&#xD;
      outcomes in adults.&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODS:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Setting This will be a pragmatic, blinded, randomized controlled trial (RCT) conducted&#xD;
      in the ED of Mount Sinai Hospital, in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. This is a tertiary care,&#xD;
      urban teaching hospital with approximately 65,000 ED visits per year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion Criteria Patients will be considered for inclusion if they are 18 years and older,&#xD;
      live independently, present to the ED with an acutely painful condition occurring within 7&#xD;
      days prior to ED visit, and if their treating ED physician intends to prescribe opioid&#xD;
      analgesic upon ED discharge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion Criteria Patients will be excluded from this study if they have an allergy to any&#xD;
      of the study drugs (acetaminophen, polyethylene glycol 3350 (PEG), codeine, oxycodone or&#xD;
      hydromorphone), are non-English speaking without an adequate interpreter available, are&#xD;
      already on prescribed chronic opioid pain medication, have ongoing use of sedating&#xD;
      medications (ie. benzodiazepines, antipsychotics), have current substance use disorder&#xD;
      (excluding tobacco), are on opioid substitution therapy, comorbidity representing an absolute&#xD;
      or relative contraindication to acute opioid prescribing (ie. any medical condition requiring&#xD;
      home oxygen, Addison's disease, dialysis dependence, obstructive sleep apnea on non-invasive&#xD;
      positive pressure ventilation, body mass index &gt; 45, Cushing's Disease), have moderate or&#xD;
      severe dementia, inability to follow-up, or reside in a nursing home or location where a&#xD;
      professional dispenses medications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Protocol Attending physicians will identify eligible patients prior to ED discharge,&#xD;
      and informed written consent for trial participation will be obtained by trained research&#xD;
      personnel. Research personnel will not approach physicians for fractures or painful&#xD;
      conditions alone, rather they approached on the basis of the treating physician's intent to&#xD;
      prescribe opioids for home use. After providing informed written consent, patients will be&#xD;
      randomized to either receive oxycodone, hydromorphone or codeine for analgesia for home use&#xD;
      using a fixed 1:1:1 allocation ratio produced by a computer-based random number generator.&#xD;
      Block sizes of 6 will be used to ensure equal allocation to each group. MSH pharmacy will&#xD;
      prepare study drugs in opaque vials with identical labels based on a randomization scheme&#xD;
      provided by the trial methodologist. The opaque vials will be included in sealed,&#xD;
      sequentially numbered study packets that will be replaced as they are used. To avoid&#xD;
      potential patient selection and allocation bias, all physicians, nurses, RAs and patients&#xD;
      will be blinded to the randomization schedule. Study investigators will be permitted to&#xD;
      un-blind the study medication in the event of allergic reaction, consisting of rash and/or&#xD;
      airway compromise.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each research packet to be dispensed to patients at ED discharge will contain 3 medication&#xD;
      vials and medication instructions as below:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Acetaminophen 500 mg Instructions: Take 1 - 2 tablets by mouth every 8 hours as needed&#xD;
           for pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Polyethylene Glycol 3350 (PEG) 17 g sachets Instructions: Dissolve in 120 to 240 mL (4&#xD;
           to 8 ounces) of beverage and drink. Use one sachet daily as needed to prevent&#xD;
           constipation if you are taking the opioid study drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Blinded Opioid Study Medication in an opaque vial (5 mg morphine equivalent tablets of&#xD;
           either codeine, oxycodone or hydromorphone) Codeine: 30 mg tablets Oxycodone: 5 mg&#xD;
           tablets Hydromorphone: 1 mg tablets Instructions: Take 1 tablet every 4 hours as needed&#xD;
           for moderate to severe pain if you continue to have pain despite taking acetaminophen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research packet will be kept in the locked narcotic cupboard of the ambulatory care&#xD;
      assessment are in the ED in a box labeled &quot;Study Drugs&quot;. At any given time, 3 packets will be&#xD;
      maintained, and the temperature of this cupboard will be monitored by the study RA. The room&#xD;
      temp logs will be maintained on a daily basis with a calibrated thermometer. The key to this&#xD;
      cupboard is kept by the nurse on duty in this area.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once a patient is randomized, the physician will order a study medication packet with a paper&#xD;
      order for prescribing the study drug (designed and provided by MSH pharmacy). The nurse in&#xD;
      the ambulatory care area will remove this packet from the cupboard, log its removal on a&#xD;
      study specific narcotic sheet for inventory in ED. As in any other narcotic stored in the ED,&#xD;
      the study packets will be counted daily at the end of the day as per narcotic regulations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The RA will record the patient's name, MRN, and other info on label that is dispensed with&#xD;
      study medication (follow labeling requirements). The RA will inform the patient of medication&#xD;
      instructions, possible side effects and medication reconciliation procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Trained research personnel will collect demographic and clinical parameters (medical history,&#xD;
      physical examination findings, diagnostic testing, ED management) from the patient and from&#xD;
      paper and electronic charts using a standardized data collection tool.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Discharge instructions will be read by the attending physician. Patients will be provided a&#xD;
      printed copy of the discharge instructions. The RA will discuss each of the medications&#xD;
      provided to the patient and read the specific instructions and potential side effects for&#xD;
      each medication. The RA will also instruct the patient how to complete the Medication Diary.&#xD;
      Prior to ED discharge, the RA will schedule the telephone follow-up assessment and will&#xD;
      administer the BPI. Patients will be provided a pre-addressed envelope to return study&#xD;
      medications and the completed Medication Diary to the research team at study completion. At&#xD;
      the time of discharge, a time will be scheduled for a courier to pick up unused study&#xD;
      medications from their home. The envelope will be signed by the patient on shipping and&#xD;
      signed by the study coordinator or pharmacy on receiving. The patient will also have the&#xD;
      option of bringing their unused study medications to their scheduled MSH Fracture Clinic&#xD;
      appointment, if applicable, where the RA will meet them to reconcile the study medications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be contacted via telephone by a RA to complete follow-up assessments 72 hours&#xD;
      following the initial ED visit. To assess the compliance of patients with discharge&#xD;
      instructions, they will be asked to complete a Medication Diary that consists of questions,&#xD;
      taking less than 1 minute to complete daily. If telephone contact is not successful on the&#xD;
      first day of scheduled follow-up, participants will be left a message to remind them of the&#xD;
      scheduled telephone interview. If telephone follow-up is not successful on the first day of&#xD;
      scheduled follow-up, attempts will be made on the 2nd and 3rd days. If contact is not made&#xD;
      within a 3 day timeframe, patients will be considered lost to follow-up, and their data will&#xD;
      be excluded from further analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome Measures The primary outcome of this study will be differences in pain severity 3&#xD;
      days following ED discharge as measured by the Brief Pain Inventory (BPI). BPI is the best&#xD;
      way to measure differences in pain severity in clinical trials. It measures pain severity&#xD;
      using the mean score of 4 questions (worst pain, least pain, average pain and current pain)&#xD;
      on a numeric rating scale (0-10).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcomes will include differences in functional outcomes, analgesic use, side&#xD;
      effects, and adverse events. Participants' functional outcomes will be assessed using the BPI&#xD;
      - interference questions. Analgesic use will be quantified in pill counts collected from both&#xD;
      telephone follow-up surveys as well as on the Medication Diaries. Side effects will be&#xD;
      measured using a modified version of The Numerical Opioid Side Effect (NOSE) Assessment Tool&#xD;
      during the telephone follow-up, and adverse events are defined as falls, unplanned visits to&#xD;
      a healthcare provider (return ED visits, family physician, walk-in clinic), allergic&#xD;
      reaction, overdose, and death.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Analyses Data will be entered directly into a study specific Microsoft Excel database&#xD;
      (Microsoft Corporation, Redmond, Washington). Descriptive statistics will be summarized using&#xD;
      means with standard deviations (SD), medians with interquartile ranges (IQR) or frequencies&#xD;
      with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) where appropriate. The study design assumes three arms&#xD;
      (codeine, oxycodone and hydromorphone), therefore the 2-tailed alpha will be set to 0.025 to&#xD;
      adjust for the increased risk of type-I error with 3 pairwise comparisons. An&#xD;
      intention-to-treat analysis will be performed. To test for pairwise equality between groups,&#xD;
      a 1-way ANOVA will be employed. Proportional differences will be assessed using Pearson&#xD;
      chi-square statistic. Missing data points will be excluded from the analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assuming a mean (SD) change in pain scores between groups of 2.2 (3.0), a minimum clinically&#xD;
      important difference on the Brief Pain Inventory of 2.0 , a 2-tailed alpha of 0.025 to adjust&#xD;
      for 3 pairwise comparisons and a beta of 0.20, the investigators estimate that 47 patients&#xD;
      per group (N=141) will be required. To account for potential loss to follow-up, the&#xD;
      investigators will increase sample size by 25% per group, resulting in a final sample size of&#xD;
      177 patients (59 per group).&#xD;
