  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Post-operative paediatric cerebellar mutism syndrome (pCMS) is a well-recognised complication&#xD;
      of resective surgery for brain tumours of the cerebellum and fourth ventricle in children.&#xD;
      Occurring in around 25% of infratentorial craniotomies, it is characterised by a delayed&#xD;
      onset of mutism and emotional lability, and may comprise motoric and cognitive cerebellar&#xD;
      deficits. Transient mutism gives way to prolonged, and often incomplete, recovery.&#xD;
      Neuroimaging studies are beginning to reveal anatomical and functional aberrancies in the&#xD;
      brain of children with pCMS. The cerebellar efferent pathways are likely to be implicated as&#xD;
      a neuroanatomical substrate in the development of pCMS, as shown by a handful of diffusion&#xD;
      tractography studies to date. However, the pathophysiology of this condition still remains&#xD;
      unclear. Hypoperfusion of supratentorial cortical and subcortical structures may mediate the&#xD;
      speech and behavioural deficits seen in pCMS, and is a candidate for a causal&#xD;
      pathophysiological mechanism.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aims to prospectively image children with pCMS using advanced MRI techniques&#xD;
      including diffusion tractography and arterial spin labelling, and to correlate this with&#xD;
      clinical descriptions of the syndrome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All children referred to Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children with a posterior fossa&#xD;
      brain tumour will be imaged pre-operatively, post-operatively and at delayed follow-up. In&#xD;
      tandem with this, clinical assessments will be made of children post-operatively to ascertain&#xD;
      which patients develop pCMS. In addition, anonymised advanced MRI data on healthy controls&#xD;
      will be used as a comparator group.&#xD;
