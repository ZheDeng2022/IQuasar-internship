    <textblock>
      This study is being done to evaluate the rate of hematological response (complete&#xD;
      remission/complete remission with partial hematological recovery [CR/CRh*]) induced by&#xD;
      blinatumomab in Chinese adults with relapsed/refractory B-precursor acute lymphoblastic&#xD;
      leukemia (ALL).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open label, single-arm, multicenter phase 3 study to evaluate efficacy and safety&#xD;
      of the BiTE (bispecific T cell engager) antibody blinatumomab in Chinese adults with&#xD;
      relapsed/refractory B-precursor ALL. The study will consist of a screening period, a&#xD;
      treatment period, and a follow-up period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment will consist of up to 5 cycles of blinatumomab. Participants who achieve a bone&#xD;
      marrow (BM) response (≤ 5% BM blasts) or CR/CRh*/CRi within 2 induction cycles of treatment&#xD;
      may continue to receive up to 3 additional consolidation cycles of blinatumomab. Thirty days&#xD;
      after end of the last dose of protocol-specified therapy, participants will have a safety&#xD;
      follow-up visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If subjects are suitable for allogeneic stem cell transplantation (alloHSCT) after treatment&#xD;
      with blinatumomab, they may undergo alloHSCT instead of receiving further consolidation&#xD;
      cycles with blinatumomab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be followed via clinic visit or telephone contact every 3 months after&#xD;
      their safety follow-up visit until death has been observed or a maximum of 2 years after&#xD;
      start of treatment, whichever occurs first.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A planned interim analysis to assess efficacy and safety of blinatumomab was to be based on&#xD;
      the interim analysis set (N = 90). The efficacious benefit assessment based on an&#xD;
      O'Brien-Fleming alpha spending function (O'Brien and Fleming, 1979) with the critical&#xD;
      boundary 42.2% at the interim analysis and 39.2% at the primary analysis in CR/CRh* rate. If&#xD;
      the interim analysis showed statistically efficacious and overall benefit-risk analysis to be&#xD;
      promising per the data review team review, then the interim analysis could become the primary&#xD;
      analysis of this study. In addition, the study would continue its enrollment until 120&#xD;
      participants had been enrolled and continued their participation in the study to complete&#xD;
      protocol-specified procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The data cutoff date of 12 April 2019 allowed for the 90th participant enrolled before 21&#xD;
      February 2019 to have had the opportunity to complete 2 cycles of treatment and the safety&#xD;
      follow-up visit (if the participant had discontinued treatment after 2 cycles).&#xD;

    <description>The European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire-C30 (EORTC QLQ-C30) is a 30-question tool used to assess the overall quality of life in cancer patients. It consists of 15 domains: 1 global health status (GHS) scale, 5 functional scales, and 9 symptom scales/items. The GHS is reported in this outcome.&#xD;
For the GHS, scores range from 0 to 100 with a high score indicating better global health status/functioning. A ≥ 10-point decrease from baseline indicates a deterioration in quality of life.&#xD;
Months are calculated from start of blinatumomab date to deterioration/censor date, divided by 30.5.</description>

    <description>Adverse events (AEs) were evaluated for severity according to the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE), version 4.03, as follows:&#xD;
Grade 1 - Mild AE; Grade 2 - Moderate AE; Grade 3 - Severe AE; Grade 4 - Life-threatening or disabling AE; Grade 5 - Death.&#xD;
An AE was considered &quot;serious&quot; if it resulted in death, was life-threatening, required or prolonged inpatient hospitalization, resulted in persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption to conduct normal life functions, was a congenital anomaly or birth defect or was a medically important condition.</description>

In general, Amgen does not grant external requests for individual patient data for the purpose of re-evaluating safety and efficacy issues already addressed in the product labelling. Requests are reviewed by a committee of internal advisors, and if not approved, may be further arbitrated by a Data Sharing Independent Review Panel. Upon approval, information necessary to address the research question will be provided under the terms of a data sharing agreement.

    <participant_flow>
      <recruitment_details>This is an ongoing study conducted at 23 centers in China. Overall 121 participants were enrolled.&#xD;
The data cutoff date for the primary analysis reported is 12 April 2019; 106 participants enrolled prior to the data cutoff date.&#xD;
The study includes a treatment period, a safety follow-up (SFU) visit 30 days after last dose and a follow-up period.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>The data cutoff date of 12 April 2019 allowed for the protocol-specified 90th participant enrolled before 21 February 2019 to have had the opportunity to complete 2 cycles of treatment and the SFU visit (if discontinued treatment after 2 cycles).&#xD;
Data are not available for the 15 participants who enrolled between 21 February 2019 and 12 April 2019.</pre_assignment_details>

          <description>Participants received blinatumomab by continuous intravenous (CIV) infusion over 4 weeks followed by a treatment-free interval of 2 weeks for up to 5 consecutive cycles. Treatment consisted of two induction cycles and up to 3 consolidation cycles of treatment for responders.&#xD;
In the first induction cycle, the initial dose of blinatumomab was 9 μg/day for days 1-7 and then escalated (dose step) to 28 μg/day starting on day 8 (week 2) through day 29 (week 4), followed by two weeks without blinatumomab treatment.&#xD;
In subsequent cycles (beginning with the second induction cycle and continuing through consolidation, for applicable participants) 28 μg/day was administered for all 4 weeks of continuous treatment, followed by a treatment-free interval of two weeks.</description>

        <description>A CR is defined as having ≤ 5% blasts in the bone marrow, no evidence of disease, and full recovery of peripheral blood counts (platelets &gt; 100,000/μL, and absolute neutrophil count [ANC] &gt; 1,000/μL).&#xD;
CRh* is defined as ≤ 5% blasts in the bone marrow, no evidence of disease and partial recovery of peripheral blood counts: platelets &gt; 50,000/μl, and ANC &gt; 500/μl.&#xD;
CR/CRh* rate is defined as the percentage of participants who achieve CR/CRh* within 2 cycles of treatment with blinatumomab. Participants without response assessment were accounted for in the denominator when calculating the response rate, ie, these participants were counted as non-responders.&#xD;
The interim analysis was to become the primary analysis by meeting pre-specified efficacy and safety criteria based on an O'Brien-Fleming alpha spending function with the critical boundary 42.2%.</description>

In subsequent cycles (beginning with the second induction cycle and continuing through consolidation, for applicable participants) 28 μg/day was administered for all 4 weeks of continuous treatment, followed by a treatment-free interval of two weeks.</description>

          <title>Percentage of Participants With a CR or CRh* or Complete Remission With Incomplete Hematological Recovery Without CRh* (CRi) (CR/CRh*/CRi) Within 2 Treatment Cycles With Blinatumomab</title>
          <description>CRi is defined as ≤ 5% blasts in the bone marrow, no evidence of disease and incomplete recovery of peripheral blood counts: platelets &gt; 100,000/μl or ANC &gt; 1,000/μl (but not both).&#xD;
CR/CRh*/CRi rate is defined as the percentage of participants who achieve CR/CRh*/CRi within 2 cycles of treatment with blinatumomab. Participants without response assessment were accounted for in the denominator when calculating the response rate, ie, these participants were counted as non-responders.</description>

      <pi_employee>Principal Investigators are NOT employed by the organization sponsoring the study.</pi_employee>
      <restrictive_agreement>The Clinical Trial Agreement generally does not restrict an investigator's discussion of trial results after completion. The Agreement permits Amgen a limited period of time to review material discussing trial results (typically up to 45 days and possible extension). Amgen may remove confidential information, but authors have final control and approval of publication content. For multicenter studies, the investigator agrees not to publish any results before the first multi-center publication.</restrictive_agreement>
