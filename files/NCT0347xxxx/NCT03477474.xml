  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this registry is to collect data that describes the characteristics of people&#xD;
      with advanced cancer for whom the Guardant360 assay is ordered and to observe their clinical&#xD;
      outcomes after receiving their results.&#xD;

      This is a prospective, descriptive registry of people with advanced cancer for whom a&#xD;
      Guardant360 assay has been ordered by their health care providers. The registry is divided&#xD;
      into modules according to primary cancer diagnosis. Module 1 includes subjects with advanced&#xD;
      NSCLC with additional modules added later in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All eligible people for whom blood for a Guardant360 assay has been collected will be invited&#xD;
      to participate in the registry. Subject demographics and relevant medical history will be&#xD;
      collected at the time of enrollment. Information on tumor molecular testing, treatment&#xD;
      decisions, and clinical outcomes from the time of enrollment will be collected in a&#xD;
      prospective manner. The registry does not require any specific treatments or procedures but&#xD;
      rather collects information on the treatment journey of each participant. Subjects may&#xD;
      participate in other clinical studies while also participating in GEODE.&#xD;
