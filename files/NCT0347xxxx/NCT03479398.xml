    <textblock>
      This project compares two methods of assessing the quality of cognitive behavioral therapy&#xD;
      (CBT) that do not involve directly observing sessions: 1) adherence checklists embedded in&#xD;
      clinical notes, and 2) rating the quality of worksheets that are completed with therapist&#xD;
      guidance during sessions. It also examines whether ratings of worksheets completed on a&#xD;
      mobile app are reliable and valid quality measures. This information can inform strategies to&#xD;
      monitor and enhance CBT quality, which can ultimately improve the quality of care and&#xD;
      clinical outcomes.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) has been demonstrated to be effective for numerous&#xD;
      presenting problems, including depression, anxiety, and post-traumatic stress disorder&#xD;
      (PTSD). Several large mental health systems have invested heavily in programs to train their&#xD;
      clinicians in CBTs, but relatively little attention has been devoted to the monitoring or&#xD;
      promotion of CBT quality after training is complete. Identifying strategies to do so can&#xD;
      facilitate research and training, and is critical to ensuring consumer access to high&#xD;
      quality, evidence-based treatments. The lack of a scalable, effective, and efficient method&#xD;
      of monitoring quality is a key barrier to efforts to promote high-quality implementation.&#xD;
      Self-report fidelity assessments increase clinician and consumer burden and may not&#xD;
      accurately reflect clinician skill or the intensity with which CBT interventions are&#xD;
      delivered. Observation and expert ratings are time and resource intensive and unlikely to be&#xD;
      feasible or affordable in large systems. To maximize the likelihood of broad implementation&#xD;
      once effective strategies to monitor quality are established, it is essential that these&#xD;
      strategies are feasible and acceptable in routine care contexts, leveraging information&#xD;
      collected during routine care. To date, few monitoring strategies that do not involve&#xD;
      observation, client/caregiver reports, or clinician self-reports have been tested. To address&#xD;
      this critical implementation challenge, we propose to refine and evaluate a method of&#xD;
      monitoring quality that is based on an evaluation of CBT worksheets that are completed in&#xD;
      session. Because the worksheets were developed to implement core cognitive and behavioral&#xD;
      elements and are embedded in CBTs across diagnostic categories, they may be used to elucidate&#xD;
      the clinician's ability to guide the client through CBT interventions in session. Preliminary&#xD;
      research with this measure demonstrated high correlations between the measure and observer&#xD;
      ratings of clinician competence, associations with subsequent symptom change, and high&#xD;
      agreement between raters with differing levels of familiarity with CBT. Completion of the&#xD;
      ratings based on worksheets requires only a small fraction of time required for session&#xD;
      observation and ratings. This project will compare this novel strategy to observer ratings&#xD;
      and adherence checklists that are embedded in clinical notes. Furthermore, it will compare&#xD;
      the accuracy of worksheet data collected by mobile app to paper-form worksheets, and assess&#xD;
      the feasibility and acceptability of these strategies. Because the core elements of CBT and&#xD;
      its worksheets are common across many CBTs, this research has broad implications for&#xD;
      monitoring fidelity to CBTs in a variety of mental health and healthcare systems and&#xD;
      settings. This research will be conducted by a team of investigators with expertise in CBT,&#xD;
      training, implementation, psychotherapy process and outcome research, psychometrics,&#xD;
      longitudinal data analysis, mobile technologies and healthcare economics, with input from&#xD;
      community partners and end-users. The resulting products have the potential to significantly&#xD;
      improve efforts to monitor and ensure ongoing high quality implementation of CBT in routine&#xD;
      care settings.&#xD;
