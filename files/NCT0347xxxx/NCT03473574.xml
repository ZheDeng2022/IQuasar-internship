  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To determine the efficacy in terms of objective response rate (ORR) of the combination of&#xD;
      durvalumab and tremelimumab in addition with gemcitabine or in addition with gemcitabine and&#xD;
      cisplatin in treatment-naïve patients with advanced, unresectable and/or metastatic&#xD;
      cholangio- and gallbladder carcinoma (CCA).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with CCA have poor outcomes, as a consequence of the very aggressive nature of the&#xD;
      disease, and the limited treatment options. Thus there is a significant unmet medical need&#xD;
      for additional treatment options for use in this patient population. As in most other tumor&#xD;
      entities however, only a fraction of patients respond to immunotherapy alone. Evidence&#xD;
      suggests that those patients might preferentially have tumors that have favorable mutational&#xD;
      landscapes, express the PD-L1 and/ or contain preexisting tumor-infiltrating CD8+ T cells&#xD;
      that are inhibited locally, e.g., by PD-1 engagement. In order to increase the proportion of&#xD;
      patients who could ultimately benefit from immunotherapies, it is important to develop&#xD;
      strategies that can be employed for converting tumor microenvironments lacking T cell&#xD;
      infiltration to ones displaying antitumor T-cell immunity and therefore to sensitize tumors&#xD;
      to checkpoint inhibition therapy. Therefore, the aim of this study is to determine the&#xD;
      combination of durvalumab and tremelimumab in addition with gemcitabine or in addition with&#xD;
      gemcitabine and cisplatin in treatment-naïve patients with advanced, unresectable and/or&#xD;
      metastatic cholangio- and gallbladder carcinoma.&#xD;
