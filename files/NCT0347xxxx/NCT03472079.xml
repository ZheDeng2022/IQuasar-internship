  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with septic shock in the intensive care unit have a high risk to develop acute&#xD;
      kidney injury (AKI) and AKI is an independent risk factor of mortality. Given the absence of&#xD;
      validated pharmacological treatments for limiting the progression of AKI or for accelerating&#xD;
      recovery from AKI, early intervention and the restoration of the glomerular filtration rate&#xD;
      (GFR) in this context of septic shock might improve the patients' prognosis. One major&#xD;
      challenge is to determine whether or not the AKI is reversible (return to normal function&#xD;
      KDIGO 0 within 72 hours). In this retrospective study the investigators will analyze all&#xD;
      patients admitted for a septic shock in three French ICUs between the 1st january 2014 and&#xD;
      01st January 2017 who developed an AKI (KDIGO ≥1) at admission and who had a determination of&#xD;
      the urine concentration of TIMP2*IGFBP7 at admission. The investigators will determine the&#xD;
      best threshold of TIMP2*IGFBP7 to distinguish the population of patients who will return to&#xD;
      normal kidney function within 72 hours (KDIGO 0).&#xD;

      Background :&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with septic shock in the intensive care unit have a high risk to develop acute&#xD;
      kidney injury (AKI). AKI is an independent risk factor of mortality. Given the absence of&#xD;
      validated pharmacological treatments for limiting the progression of AKI or for accelerating&#xD;
      recovery from AKI, early intervention and the restoration of the glomerular filtration rate&#xD;
      (GFR) in this context of septic shock might improve the patients' prognosis. One major&#xD;
      challenge is therefore how to determine whether or not the AKI is reversible. The&#xD;
      best-studied biomarkers (NGAL and KIM 1) have little discriminant power in septic patients&#xD;
      because of their poor specificity or unsuitable kinetics for very early diagnosis. The&#xD;
      combination of urine assays for tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase 2 (TIMP2) and&#xD;
      insulin-like growth factor binding protein 7 (IGFBP7) has shown good diagnostic performance&#xD;
      for the very early detection of the risk of developing AKI in the following 12 hrs. Urine&#xD;
      levels of these two markers specifically reflect damage to kidney tubules. Moreover, the&#xD;
      levels appear to be strongly correlated with the severity of tubule damage. Thus, one can&#xD;
      reasonably hypothesize that measurement of these markers in the very early stages of septic&#xD;
      shock might determine the presence and severity of kidney tubule damage. A threshold (yet to&#xD;
      be defined) would help to differentiate between (i) transient, non-severe injury and (ii)&#xD;
      injury that is already too severe to be reversible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Purpose : to determine whether or not the urine concentration of TIMP2*IGFBP7 may distinguish&#xD;
      patients with high risk of persistent or transient AKI during the early phase of septic&#xD;
      shock.&#xD;
