  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Inlet patch is a congenital condition of the upper oesophagus, consisting of stomach lining&#xD;
      that is in the wrong place. It affects 5% of the population. Symptoms are a feeling of a ball&#xD;
      in the back of the throat (called chronic globus sensation), cough and sore throat - these&#xD;
      account for 4% of general practitioner (GP) referral to Ear Nose &amp; Throat departments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is no recognised treatment. Drugs that reduce acid may help but do not block mucus&#xD;
      production. Argon Plasma coagulation has been shown to be successful but limited to a few&#xD;
      expert centres. The investigators have previously shown a device that uses radiofrequency&#xD;
      energy to remove the patch to be highly effective in a ten patient pilot study, with 80%&#xD;
      response rate that was durable over 1 year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this trial is to demonstrate the previous study was not due to placebo effect&#xD;
      alone, with a sham controlled arm. Patients would then crossover to treatment at 6 months&#xD;
      after sham. All males and non-pregnant females over 18 years old with previously diagnosed&#xD;
      inlet patch causing symptoms of globus, with &gt; 50% severity on a visual analogue score, are&#xD;
      eligible.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Inlet patch is a congenital anomaly of the upper oesophagus, consisting of stomach lining&#xD;
      that is in an aberrant position. Prevalence is up to 10% on endoscopy studies and 5% on post&#xD;
      mortem studies. There is thought to be a link with another condition of the lower oesophagus&#xD;
      called Barrett's oesophagus, although there is limited evidence. Unlike Barrett's oesophagus,&#xD;
      progression to cancer from an inlet patch is exceptionally rare.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The inlet patch can produce acid and mucus, and is associated with symptoms including sore&#xD;
      throat, cough and hoarseness. One particular symptom, called globus pharyngeus (the feeling&#xD;
      of a ball in the back of the throat) is often associated with an inlet patch.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is no recognised treatment for symptomatic inlet patch. Anti-acid medications works for&#xD;
      some but not all, which may in part be explained by the lack of acid producing cells in some&#xD;
      inlet patches. Ablation of the inlet patch has been successful in small series using Argon&#xD;
      Plasma Coagulation. This device is, however, associated with inter user variability and&#xD;
      unpredictable depth of ablation. Radiofrequency ablation (RFA) using the BarrxTM System is a&#xD;
      National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) and FDA approved device for&#xD;
      treatment of abnormal oesophageal lining, which has shown to be successful in reversing&#xD;
      Barrett's oesophagus to normal squamous lining. These devices are advantageous as the depth&#xD;
      of ablation is controlled. The investigators have previously demonstrated, in a pilot study,&#xD;
      that these devices are safe and effective for reversal of inlet patch to normal mucosa, with&#xD;
      improvement in symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will use the BarrxTM system to treat patients with symptomatic inlet patch that is&#xD;
      refractory to standard anti-acid medication, in a blinded sham controlled trial.&#xD;

    <description>Ablation using the Barrx RFA System is a new technique for field ablation in the oesophagus. It has been used for eradication of diseased epithelium of all three subclasses of Barrett's oesophagus (non-dysplastic Intestinal metaplasia (IM), Low grade dysplasia (LGD) and High grade dysplasia (HGD). The BarrxTM RFA System uses ultra short pulse RF energy delivering 40Watts/cm2 power density and 12Joule/cm2 energy density, and affects the mucosa whilst preserving the submucosa.&#xD;
Clinical trials have suggested that it is safe and effective for treating non-dysplastic IM, LGD and HGD in Barrett's oesophagus . Long term data show the effect to be durable over 5 years.</description>
