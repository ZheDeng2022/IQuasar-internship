      This phase IIA trial studies the side effects of ribociclib and aromatase inhibitor and how&#xD;
      well they work in treating participants with hormone receptor positive breast cancer that has&#xD;
      spread to other places in the body. Ribociclib and aromatase inhibitors may stop the growth&#xD;
      of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To estimate the safety and tolerability of the combination of ribociclib and an aromatase&#xD;
      inhibitor in adults age 70 or older with hormone receptor positive metastatic breast cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To describe the full toxicity profile including all grades. II. To estimate the rate of&#xD;
      worst grades of myelosuppression (neutropenia, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, and anemia),&#xD;
      neutropenic fever, gastrointestinal (GI) side effects (nausea, diarrhea, decreased appetite,&#xD;
      vomiting, stomatitis), fatigue, neuropathy, and thromboembolism.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To describe rates of dose reductions, dose holds, and hospitalizations. IV. To estimate&#xD;
      objective response rate and clinical benefit rate as defined by modified Response Evaluation&#xD;
      Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) (1.1) criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. To estimate median progression-free and overall survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To estimate the rate of adherence to ribociclib. II. To explore factors other than&#xD;
      chronologic age that can affect toxicity rates as identified using a cancer-specific&#xD;
      geriatric assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To describe the results of the Was It Worth It (WIWI) and the results of the Overall&#xD;
      Treatment Utility (OTU) Questionnaires.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants receive ribociclib orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-21 and aromatase&#xD;
      inhibitor per treating investigator's discretion. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence&#xD;
      of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, participants are followed up at 30 days, then annually&#xD;
      thereafter.&#xD;
