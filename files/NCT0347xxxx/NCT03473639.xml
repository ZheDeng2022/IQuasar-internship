  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to learn about the safety and side effects of combining&#xD;
      entinostat, an investigational drug, with capecitabine, a drug commonly used in breast cancer&#xD;
      (BC), in both participants with metastatic breast cancer (MBC) and then participants with&#xD;
      high-risk breast cancer after neo-adjuvant therapy.&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In order to identify the maximum dose that should be used in future participants, the first&#xD;
      participants will start at a low dose of both drugs. If the participants on this dose level&#xD;
      tolerate the treatment well without too many side effects, the next participants will receive&#xD;
      a higher dose of one of the medications, and if those participants also tolerate the&#xD;
      treatment well, then the drugs will continue to be increased with the next participants until&#xD;
      a maximum dose that participants tolerate well is reached.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants in both groups will receive entinostat on days 1, 8, and 15 of each 21-day cycle&#xD;
      and capecitabine on days 1-14 of each cycle. MBC participants may receive this treatment as&#xD;
      long as they do not have disease progression or side effects that require them to stop study&#xD;
      treatment while participants with high-risk BC after neo-adjuvant therapy will receive up to&#xD;
      8 cycles of study treatment as long as they do not have disease progression or side effects&#xD;
      that require them to stop study treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While participants are on study treatment, they will have regular physical exams and labs.&#xD;
      After participants finish study treatment, they should be followed by their primary&#xD;
      oncologist at least once a year. Study staff will also be in contact by phone at least once a&#xD;
      year for 10 years.&#xD;

         13. Known history of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) (HIV 1/2 antibodies), due to&#xD;
             concerns for potential drug-drug interactions with entinostat and anti-retroviral&#xD;
             medications.&#xD;
&#xD;
         14. Known active hepatitis B (e.g., hepatitis B surface antigen-reactive) or hepatitis C&#xD;
             (e.g., hepatitis C virus ribonucleic acid [qualitative]). Patients with past hepatitis&#xD;
             B virus (HBV) infection or resolved HBV infection (defined as the presence of&#xD;
             hepatitis B core antibody [HBc Ab] and absence of HBsAg) are eligible. HBV DNA test&#xD;
             must be performed in these patients prior to study treatment. Patients positive for&#xD;
             hepatitis C virus (HCV) antibody are eligible only if polymerase chain reaction is&#xD;
             negative for HCV RNA.&#xD;
&#xD;
         15. If female, is pregnant or breastfeeding.&#xD;
&#xD;
         16. The following medications are prohibited while the patient is receiving entinostat:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Any other HDAC Inhibitor, including valproic acid&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. DNA methyltransferase inhibitors&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. Any additional anticancer agents (excluding entinostat and capecitabine), such as&#xD;
                  chemotherapy, immunotherapy, targeted therapy, biological response modifiers, or&#xD;
                  endocrine therapy, will not be allowed, even if utilized as treatment of&#xD;
                  non-cancer indications.&#xD;
&#xD;
               4. Any investigational agents.&#xD;
&#xD;
               5. Radiation Therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
               6. Traditional herbal medicines; these therapies are not fully studied and their use&#xD;
                  may result in unanticipated drug-drug interactions that may cause or confound the&#xD;
                  assessment of toxicity.&#xD;
