  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Latitude is an observational study exploring how effective Bulkamid ® is as a first line&#xD;
      treatment for women with stress urinary incontinence. Women who choose to have Bulkamid as&#xD;
      part of their standard clinical care will be asked to complete questionnaires before and&#xD;
      after their surgery so that we can assess how their urinary symptoms change.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As a second part of the study, we are asking all patients having any first line treatment for&#xD;
      stress incontinence to complete a short questionnaire telling us how they decided what&#xD;
      treatment to have. A small number of these women will be contacted via telephone and asked&#xD;
      whether they would mind being interviewed to tell us more about this.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will also interview a number of doctors taking part in Latitude to find out how they&#xD;
      counsel patients about different treatment options for stress urinary incontinence.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-centre observational study to investigate the effectiveness of the urethral&#xD;
      bulking agent, Bulkamid®, as a primary treatment for stress urinary incontinence (SUI). It&#xD;
      also contains an embedded qualitative sub-study to investigate factors that influence patient&#xD;
      choice of surgical treatment for SUI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bulkamid® is a non-toxic hydrogel that is injected under the lining of the urethra. It&#xD;
      increases the urethral 'bulk', hence increasing resistance against leakage of urine. It is&#xD;
      being increasingly offered as a primary treatment for SUI due to the reduced associated&#xD;
      risks, ability to administer in the outpatient setting and recent controversy surrounding&#xD;
      polypropylene mesh. However, there is currently limited data on how effective it is as a&#xD;
      first line treatment, both in the short and long term, and what effect it may have on&#xD;
      secondary continence procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aims to collect data from 220 women who choose Bulkamid® as their primary&#xD;
      treatment over a total of 60 months to review its effectiveness. Telephone consultations will&#xD;
      take place at regular intervals using validated questionnaires to assess SUI symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is not known how easy women find it to choose between the surgical treatment options for&#xD;
      SUI, what factors they weigh up or what information would help them make this decision. The&#xD;
      embedded qualitative study of patient choice will use a combination of questionnaire and 2&#xD;
      in-depth semi structured interviews to investigate this further. Consultant Urogynaecologists&#xD;
      will also be interviewed to compare factors they think are important to their patients'&#xD;
      treatment decision with what is expressed by women with SUI. The overall aim is to develop a&#xD;
      prototype decision aid to better support women when making this treatment decision.&#xD;
