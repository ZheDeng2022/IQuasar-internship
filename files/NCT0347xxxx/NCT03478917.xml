      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Painful vasoocclusive crisis (VOC) occurs in people with sickle cell disease (SCD). People&#xD;
      with VOC have many visits to the hospital. About 10 30 percent of these people will go on to&#xD;
      develop acute chest syndrome (ACS). ACS can cause further ill health. It can also cause&#xD;
      death. Researchers want to find ways to diagnose ACS more quickly. To do this, they want to&#xD;
      use stored blood samples and scans from a study (the DeNOVO trial) that was closed in 2015.&#xD;
      They want to see if scans and samples taken of people with VOC who later developed ACS could&#xD;
      help diagnose ACS faster. The data of people in the DeNOVO study who did not develop ACS will&#xD;
      serve as controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To look at data from the DeNOVO trial to find a way to diagnose ACS more quickly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      People 10 85 years old who took part in NHLBI Protocol number 05-H-0019 (the DeNOVO trial).&#xD;
      The trial lasted from 2004 to 2008. The study was closed in November 2015.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Scans and intact, frozen samples from a study that was closed in 2015 will be studied. No new&#xD;
      participants will be enrolled.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Painful vasoocclusive crisis (VOC) is the most frequent acute clinical manifestation of&#xD;
      sickle cell disease (SCD), frequently necessitating emergency department visits and/or&#xD;
      hospitalization. Approximately 10-30% of patients admitted to the hospital with a VOC will go&#xD;
      on to develop acute chest syndrome (ACS), a complication of SCD resulting in significant&#xD;
      morbidity and mortality. While ACS related mortality appears to be improving in the United&#xD;
      States, the number of hospital admissions for ACS is on the rise. Unfortunately, the&#xD;
      diagnosis of ACS is often delayed with up to 50% of cases diagnosed two to three days after&#xD;
      an admission for VOC. The clinical diagnosis of ACS is often delayed as it mimics other&#xD;
      respiratory diseases. Furthermore, the lack of definitive laboratory and radiological&#xD;
      biomarkers further confounds the ability to detect rapidly progressive ACS, a phenotype&#xD;
      accounting for considerable ACS-related mortality. Currently, a key criterion for the&#xD;
      diagnosis of ACS is the presence of new airspace disease on a chest radiograph in a sickle&#xD;
      cell patient with respiratory symptoms. However, the appearance of abnormalities on chest&#xD;
      radiography (CXR) often lags behind clinical signs and diagnostic techniques such as computed&#xD;
      tomography (CT) which tends to reveal radiologic changes much earlier than CXR. Early&#xD;
      diagnosis and treatment of ACS improves outcomes, hence the scientific rationale to perform&#xD;
      such studies and develop diagnostic algorithms to facilitate early detection of ACS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the current study proposal, we will utilize stored blood samples and review CT scans and&#xD;
      CXRs from 65 participants of the DeNOVO trial (NHLBI protocol # 05-H-0019). This multicenter&#xD;
      trial conducted between 2004-08 at 11 centers including the NIH, showed that among patients&#xD;
      with SCD hospitalized with VOC, the use of inhaled nitric oxide compared with placebo did not&#xD;
      improve time to crisis resolution. In this study, patients enrolled at the NIH study site had&#xD;
      baseline admission research blood drawn and thoracic CT scans performed. A repeat CT scan and&#xD;
      repeat blood work was subsequently obtained during the development of ACS. The archived data&#xD;
      from this subset of the study cohort therefore provides an opportunity to rigorously test the&#xD;
      hypothesis that CT scans performed early in the setting of VOC in patients going on to&#xD;
      develop ACS would have utility in the rapid diagnosis of this condition. Furthermore, the&#xD;
      availability of stored plasma samples from this cohort permits the study of both imaging and&#xD;
      plasma biomarkers in a prospectively defined sample of SCD patients. Specifically, we will&#xD;
      identify patients admitted with VOC that went on to develop ACS and study their CT scans and&#xD;
      plasma to determine whether these biomarkers will rapidly diagnose ACS. The patients in the&#xD;
      same study who did not develop ACS will serve as controls.&#xD;
