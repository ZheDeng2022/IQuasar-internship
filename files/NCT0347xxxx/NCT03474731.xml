    <textblock>
      Background and justification: Nearly 29 million Americans (9.3% of the population) have type&#xD;
      2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) and another 86 million are considered prediabetic, 20-30% of whom&#xD;
      will develop diabetes within five years.4,5 T2DM disproportionately affects those from lower&#xD;
      socioeconomic status (SES) and rural backgrounds. Appalachian residents represent an extreme&#xD;
      version of this already vulnerable population, with rates of diabetes 46% higher than&#xD;
      national averages.6,7 The investigators have developed, pilot tested (N=41) and refined (N=48&#xD;
      in-depth interviews, 4 focus groups with 31 participants, and 2 CAB meetings with 16&#xD;
      members), a culturally appropriate, feasible, and promising intervention that combines&#xD;
      diabetes self-management education and tailored patient navigation intervention., Goal: Our&#xD;
      goal focuses on reducing HbA1c, BMI, blood pressure, lipids, and waist circumference and&#xD;
      improving T2DM self-management and clinic attendance. Leveraging local assets, including&#xD;
      faith communities, local health facilities, trained community health workers, and social&#xD;
      support, the investigators will expand a promising and refined pilot study and assess&#xD;
      outcomes, satisfaction and cost effectiveness. Innovation and impact: The proposed project is&#xD;
      among the first RCT to combine the two most influential approaches to diabetes control--&#xD;
      self-management education and tailored patient navigation in a community setting. The&#xD;
      Community to Clinic Navigation (CCN) intervention has the potential to sustainably empower&#xD;
      hard to reach populations with effective self-management education and enhance the quality of&#xD;
      healthcare in traditionally underserved communities, greatly improving T2DM outcomes.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      1. Background: Appalachian residents maintain disproportionately high rates of Type 2&#xD;
           Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) and suffer tremendous burdens from diabetic complications. The&#xD;
           main challenges to stemming adverse outcomes from T2DM involve ensuring optimal clinical&#xD;
           care and self-management. Because the prevalence of diabetes has tripled since 2005, the&#xD;
           already low supply of primary care physicians combined with this tremendous chronic&#xD;
           disease burden places huge demands on providers in rural Appalachia. Enhancing the&#xD;
           quality and efficiency of these practices by linking to community health workers has the&#xD;
           potential of mitigating the adverse effects of these shortages.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Patient navigation, particularly a clinic to community navigation (CCN) model offers an&#xD;
           innovative approach to address these inequities. Patient navigation has been implemented&#xD;
           almost exclusively in the cancer setting, despite being promising for chronic disease&#xD;
           management. The proposed project is, to our knowledge, the first to test a hybrid model&#xD;
           of clinic (health promotion professional) plus community (community health worker)&#xD;
           navigation among rural residents. Clinical patient navigation has been shown to&#xD;
           facilitate appointment setting and return visits, may improve goal setting, and enhances&#xD;
           some adherence (medication taking, blood glucose testing), but does not address some key&#xD;
           psychosocial (self-efficacy, patient activation) and practical concerns (transportation,&#xD;
           childcare, self-management) challenges. Community-based navigation programs have been&#xD;
           shown to enhance self-efficacy, decrease community barriers to care (e.g.,&#xD;
           transportation), and improved self-management, but may be less effective in ensuring&#xD;
           return visits and working collaboratively with the doctor.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Objectives: The investigators aim to test a CCN program that may improve the most&#xD;
           salient influences on diabetes outcomes and self-management, the health care context and&#xD;
           the patient's home context. Specifically, the investigators will (1) recruit 1200&#xD;
           participants from community settings with T2DM and HbA1c levels between 9-11% and&#xD;
           randomize them to one of three arms, DSMP; PN, or combined CCN intervention; (2) the&#xD;
           investigators will administer three quantitative assessments. All activities will take&#xD;
           place in Appalachia. Outcomes include physiologic data (HbA1C levels, blood pressure,&#xD;
           lipids, waist circumference and BMI, obtained by research staff); quantitative data&#xD;
           collection of self-management (medication taking, blood glucose, appointment adherence,&#xD;
           diet, physical activity, foot and eye care, obtained by interviewer); and psychosocial&#xD;
           variables (self-efficacy, patient activation, obtained by interviewer).&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Study Design: Behavioral randomized controlled trial, single blind design.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Study Population: Eligibility criteria: Adults 18+; Appalachian residence, and HBA1c&#xD;
           levels between 9-11%. Those who do not meet these inclusion criteria, are cognitively&#xD;
           impaired, or who do not wish to participate will be excluded. All race/ethnicities and&#xD;
           both genders will be included. Participants will be enrolled on a rolling basis from&#xD;
           June 1, 2014-June 2, 2019. Participants will be involved in the study for approximately&#xD;
           one year. The investigators anticipate a total of 1200 participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Subject Recruitment Methods and Privacy: Participants will be recruited through churches&#xD;
           and other community settings. If eligible (see above), project staff will call potential&#xD;
           participants within five days to verify eligibility and determine their interest in&#xD;
           participating in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Informed Consent Process: For those indicating an interest in participating, staff will&#xD;
           visit potential participants at their home or a location of their choosing and&#xD;
           administer the informed consent document. Study personnel for all phases of the project&#xD;
           will provide a clear explanation of the project and invite questions. Our informed&#xD;
           consent forms are written in a basic language. Interested participants will be asked to&#xD;
           provide their signature on the informed consent forms. A copy of the signed consent will&#xD;
           be provided for all participants. All forms will be read to participants to allay&#xD;
           concerns about limited literacy. No non-English speaking or cognitively impaired&#xD;
           participants will be recruited.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Research Procedures: The consort diagram (Figure 1) below provides an estimation and&#xD;
           visual description of the recruitment and sampling frame.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Fig 1: Consort diagram of enrollment&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Once informed consent documents are completed, participants (N=1200) will undergo&#xD;
                the baseline assessment. Baseline, posttest, and exit assessments will consist of&#xD;
                the same measures highlighted in Table 3.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. There will be three arms. For those randomized to the diabetes self management&#xD;
                program (n=435), within two weeks of initial recruitment and baseline assessment,&#xD;
                project staff will schedule the participant to attend a group Diabetes&#xD;
                Self-management Program, a six week, lay lead and en evidence-based diabetes home&#xD;
                self-management program (See Table 1, DSMP contents). Staff will arrange for the&#xD;
                group sessions of the DSMP. One session will take place every other week. Upon&#xD;
                completion of the DSMP program, approximately three month later, clinic navigation&#xD;
                will be implemented. For those randomized to the Patient Navigation group, within&#xD;
                two weeks of initial recruitment and baseline assessment, project staff will&#xD;
                schedule the participant to meet with the Community Health Worker who will&#xD;
                strategize about insuring that patients make their doctors' appointments as&#xD;
                scheduled. The CHW/Patient Navigator will make at least 4 calls to each participant&#xD;
                randomized to this group. For those randomized to the combined Community to Clinic&#xD;
                Navigation, CCN (n=435), both of the activities for the Diabetes self management&#xD;
                education group and the Patient navigation will be conducted. At month 5-6, the&#xD;
                posttest will take place. To assess sustainability, 3-4 months later, navigation&#xD;
                again will take place. An interviewer will complete the exit interview in month&#xD;
                10-11 using the same assessments. All throughout the intervention, standard medical&#xD;
                visits will take place.&#xD;

&#xD;
        8. Resources: The research and intervention activities will be conducted in participants'&#xD;
           homes, community sites, and the health clinics.&#xD;
&#xD;
        9. Potential Risks: The potential risks from participating in the study are very small.&#xD;
           Some risk of pain from a finger prick or psychological upset could result from&#xD;
           responding to interview questions or the emotional distress from questions about&#xD;
           diabetes management. The most significant risk involves any threat to confidentiality.&#xD;
           However, all project staff will be human subjects trained and have extensive experience&#xD;
           maintaining participant confidentiality.&#xD;
&#xD;
       10. Safety Precautions: In each stage of the research, the investigators will make every&#xD;
           effort to provide protection against risks. Study personnel will provide a clear&#xD;
           explanation of the project and invite questions during enrollment. In the rare event&#xD;
           that a participant experiences psychological distress resulting from the interview&#xD;
           questions or from the intervention, our staff will contact Dr. Van Breeding, internal&#xD;
           medicine physician at the MCHC. Dr. Breeding will consult with the participant, debrief&#xD;
           and discuss the participant's concerns, and refer participants to any additional&#xD;
           support. In addition, all project staff will receive training on how to respond to a&#xD;
           participant who needs additional assistance with diabetes management.&#xD;
&#xD;
       11. Benefit vs. Risk Participation in the study involves little risk for subjects in&#xD;
           comparison to the potential benefits of adopting improving diabetes outcomes.&#xD;
           Participants in the intervention group will receive their usual care, plus navigation&#xD;
           from a staff person at MCHC and an evidence-based diabetes self-management program at no&#xD;
           cost. If they are not assigned to the intervention arm, they will receive their usual&#xD;
           diabetes care. Given the disproportionate diabetes burden experienced by Appalachian&#xD;
           populations, implementing and evaluating this novel, theory based intervention has the&#xD;
           potential to save many lives while advancing intervention science.&#xD;
&#xD;
       12. Available Alternative Treatment(s): Participants will be randomized to the intervention&#xD;
           (the standard of care plus navigation with a clinic employee and community-based&#xD;
           navigation) OR will receive the standard treatment, which involves brief&#xD;
           clinically-based consultation with the health care provider.&#xD;
&#xD;
       13. Research Materials, Records, and Privacy: Two sources of data will be collected:&#xD;
           physiologic data collection (HbA1C levels, blood pressure, lipids, and BMI); and&#xD;
           quantitative assessments (surveys). Table 3 highlights the specific data to be&#xD;
           collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Table 3: Variables Data sources and collector Main outcomes HbA1C, blood pressure,&#xD;
           lipids, waist circumference, BMI Additional outcomes: Self-management outcomes&#xD;
           Medication taking, blood glucose testing, appointment adherence, diet, physical&#xD;
           activity, foot and eye care.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Assessments by UK project staff Diabetes Empowerment Scale (self-efficacy), patient&#xD;
           activation Assessments by UK project staff Sociodemographic, self-perceived health&#xD;
           status, depression, Clinic attendance, assessments by UK project staff&#xD;
&#xD;
       14. Confidentiality Confidentiality of all data will be maintained by never linking paper or&#xD;
           computer copy of data with the participants' names. A sheet with the participant's name,&#xD;
           address, telephone number, and identification number will be kept by the Project&#xD;
           Director and Principal Investigator separately in a locked file. Only staff members who&#xD;
           are authorized to review files will be permitted access to the data. As part of our&#xD;
           training, each lay health adviser and interviewer will be asked to sign a&#xD;
           confidentiality pledge promising never to reveal, alter, or falsify survey data. This&#xD;
           pledge is especially important in small, tight-knit rural communities. Data are held in&#xD;
           password-protected computers and secure servers at University of Kentucky which have&#xD;
           extensive firewalls and security measures. The investigator will keep all records&#xD;
           (tapes, informed consent documents, and other records like completed questionnaires) for&#xD;
           a minimum of six years after the completion of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;

PN has been shown to improve health behavior and increase self-efficacy, all with low costs. We will have to add an additional eligibility criterion for this group-they have to be out of compliance with medical appointments. Most participants will need PN services, owing to missed, rescheduled, or infrequent appointments. This means not attending their office visits, as recommended, which typically is every 3 months. We will interact with them to verify attendance and, at times, to access patient medical records if needed.</description>
