      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Generalized Arterial Calcification of Infancy (GACI) is a very rare disorder. It can be fatal&#xD;
      before birth or by age 6 months. Anumber of people with GACI survive into adulthood. Those&#xD;
      adults suffer from side effects of the disease, including rickets. It is unknown how common&#xD;
      the disease Autosomal Recessive Hypophosphatemic Rickets Type 2 (ARHR2) is. It also has side&#xD;
      effects. GACI and ARHR2 are usually caused by the mutations in the same gene. There are no&#xD;
      approved treatments for the two diseases. Researchers want to study people with these&#xD;
      diseases and their family members. This may help understand these rare and unique diseases&#xD;
      better. The data could lead to new treatments for GACI and ARHR2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To better understand the progression of GACI and ARHR2 and how genes might play a role in&#xD;
      them.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      People with GACI or ARHR2, both living and deceased, and their parents and siblings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will allow researchers to access their medical records. They will give this&#xD;
      consent by mail, email, or fax.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will be taken from the records. Participants names will not be used. Instead, they will&#xD;
      be identified by a code.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants may give a blood sample.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If a participant withdraws from the study, their data and samples will be destroyed. However,&#xD;
      the coded clinical data in the official medical record and data in databases will NOT be&#xD;
      destroyed.&#xD;

      This is a natural history study of patients with Generalized Arterial Calcification of&#xD;
      Infancy (GACI) or Autosomal Recessive Hypophosphatemic Rickets Type 2 (ARHR2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      GACI is an ultra-rare disorder with an estimated birth prevalence of around 1 in 200,000.&#xD;
      GACI is characterized by extensive arterial calcifications, arterial stenosis, myointimal&#xD;
      proliferation and periarticular calcifications. Individuals with GACI also experience&#xD;
      calcification in other body areas, such as joints and parenchymal organs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      GACI is generally fatal before birth or within the first six months after birth. The cause of&#xD;
      death is frequently myocardial infarction or stroke, and hypertension and congestive heart&#xD;
      failure are common in fetuses and infants with GACI. The first six months of life are&#xD;
      considered a critical period for GACI patients, and approximately 85% of infants with GACI do&#xD;
      not survive beyond this period (Moran 1975). However, the mortality rate decreases&#xD;
      substantially among patients who do survive beyond the critical period. Reports exist of&#xD;
      patients with GACI who survived into adulthood, but the frequency of this occurrence is&#xD;
      unknown, and adult patients suffer from a number of sequelae such as cognitive impairment&#xD;
      related to stroke. ARHR2 is characterized by short stature, dental caries, and bone&#xD;
      deformities, and biochemically by hypophosphatemia, hyperphosphaturia and elevated plasma&#xD;
      alkaline phosphatase. The disease frequency is unknown.&#xD;
&#xD;
      GACI and ARHR2 are most commonly due to mutations of ENPP1 (ectonucleotide&#xD;
      pyrophosphatase/phosphodiesterase 1), or less often from mutations in ABCC6 (adenosine&#xD;
      triphosphate binding cassette transporter protein subfamily C member 6). No founder mutations&#xD;
      are known, and thus no ethnic predilection is known. Both the GACI and ARHR2 phenotypes are&#xD;
      potentially fatal or associated with severe morbidity, with no FDA-approved drugs or proven&#xD;
      treatments. Animal data suggest that enzyme replacement therapy with ENPP1-Fc may be&#xD;
      effective in preventing morbidity or mortality of GACI and ARHR2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PXE (pseudoxanthoma elasticum) is an autosomal recessive disorder due to mutations in ABCC6&#xD;
      or, less often, ENPP1. PXE is characterized by ectopic calcification of the skin, eyes,&#xD;
      cardiovascular system and gastrointestinal system. This study will not focus on PXE but will&#xD;
      collect data on PXE patients, particularly when their presentation suggests elements of the&#xD;
      GACI or ARHR2 phenotypes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective of this study is to collect historical control data for future comparison&#xD;
      to data from patients treated with ENPP1-Fc so we can develop ENPP1-Fc as a treatment for&#xD;
      GACI or ARHR2. In addition, this study will allow for a better understanding of the disease&#xD;
      course to design future treatment trials. The study will utilize data obtained predominantly&#xD;
      from chart review. The goal is to enroll 100 participants, which include both living and&#xD;
      deceased individuals with GACI or ARHR2, and/or their parents and siblings. Our study will be&#xD;
      jointly and collaboratively conducted by the NIH and Inozyme.&#xD;
