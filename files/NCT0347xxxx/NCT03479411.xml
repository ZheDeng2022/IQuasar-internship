  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Phase 1, 3-part study to assess safety, tolerability and PK of single and multiple doses of&#xD;
      itraconazole administered as a dry powder for inhalation (PUR1900) in healthy subjects (parts&#xD;
      1 and 2) and a 2-period crossover study of single doses of itraconazole administered as a dry&#xD;
      powder for inhalation (PUR1900) and an oral solution (Sporanox) in adults with mild to&#xD;
      moderate, stable asthma (part 3)&#xD;

      Phase 1, multi-center, 3-part, open-label study in healthy adults (Parts 1 and 2) and adults&#xD;
      with mild to moderate, stable asthma (Part 3).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety, tolerability and PK will be assessed following either single ascending (SAD) or&#xD;
      multiple ascending (MAD) dosing of itraconazole administered as a dry powder for inhalation&#xD;
      (PUR1900; Part 1 and Part 2, respectively). Part 1 will comprise 3 separate cohorts planned&#xD;
      to receive single doses of 5, 10 and 25 mg itraconzaole, respectively. The study will have an&#xD;
      interleaved design; Part 2 will comprise 2 separate cohorts planned to receive daily doses of&#xD;
      itraconazole 10 and 20 mg per day for 14 days, respectively. Part 2, Cohort 1 will commence&#xD;
      after a review of safety data from Part 1 Cohort 2 suggests it is safe to do so.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 3 is a 2-period, randomised, crossover study in adult subjects with mild to moderate&#xD;
      stable asthma to assess the safety, tolerability and PK of single doses of itraconazole&#xD;
      administered as a dry powder for inhalation (PUR1900) and administered as an oral solution&#xD;
      (Sporanox® Oral Solution).&#xD;
