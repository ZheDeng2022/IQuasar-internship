      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation (CR) is the gold-standard in tertiary prevention of&#xD;
      coronary artery disease (CAD), yet average CR attendance is only 67%. Patient education is&#xD;
      commonly delivered during CR to impart information about CAD and its risk factors. An&#xD;
      underlying assumption is that knowledge will enhance patients' attitudes toward CR, promote&#xD;
      better program adherence, and improve clinically relevant cardiovascular outcomes. However,&#xD;
      more formative work is needed to characterize the impact of patient education delivered in a&#xD;
      CR setting on purported mechanisms-of-action in order to optimize efficacy. Few cardiac&#xD;
      patient education interventions have been empirically validated, and it is unclear whether&#xD;
      knowledge gains from education translate to improved CR attitudes and program adherence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: This study aims to 1) examine the association between cardiac patient education&#xD;
      and changes in knowledge about CAD, and; 2) explore whether changes in knowledge correspond&#xD;
      to (a) improved attitudes about CR (perceived necessity, concerns about exercise, practical&#xD;
      barriers, perceived personal suitability), and (b) increased CR adherence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: It is expected that 1) knowledge will increase from pre- to post-patient&#xD;
      education, and 2) knowledge gains will be associated with improved CR attitudes and better CR&#xD;
      adherence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: 100 adults with CAD referred to outpatient CR will be recruited prior to attending&#xD;
      four, mandatory 2.5-hour-long group-based education classes. Patients will subsequently&#xD;
      attend supervised CR exercise sessions twice-weekly for 12 weeks. Validated questionnaires&#xD;
      assessing knowledge about CAD and attitudes toward CR (i.e., perceived necessity, exercise&#xD;
      concerns, barriers, perceived suitability) will be completed pre- and post-cardiac education&#xD;
      classes, and 12-weeks post-CR. Adherence (# of CR exercise sessions attended) will be&#xD;
      obtained by chart review.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Implications: This study will help identify whether patient education delivered in a CR&#xD;
      setting impacts hypothesized treatment targets and inform future efforts to optimize&#xD;
      behavioral interventions for increasing CR utilization&#xD;

      BACKGROUND &amp; RATIONALE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cardiovascular disease, which includes coronary artery disease (CAD), is a leading cause of&#xD;
      death in Canada and worldwide. Cardiac rehabilitation (CR) is the gold standard intervention&#xD;
      for tertiary prevention of CAD, and is associated with improvements in cardiovascular risk&#xD;
      (e.g., blood pressure, psychological distress) and with 26% reductions in mortality. Despite&#xD;
      these benefits, only 20-50% of eligible patients participate and even fewer attend all&#xD;
      scheduled CR sessions. CR consists of multicomponent risk reduction interventions including&#xD;
      exercise training and patient education (PE). An underlying assumption of PE is that&#xD;
      imparting knowledge to patients will lead to changes in their adherence to health behaviours&#xD;
      and, ultimately, influence cardiovascular outcomes. Decades of research from behavioural&#xD;
      science, however, demonstrates that changing health behaviours, such as CR participation,&#xD;
      requires more than knowing &quot;what&quot; to do, but also favourable attitudes and self-efficacy&#xD;
      about behaviour change. PE has been demonstrated to enhance knowledge about CAD, but more&#xD;
      work is needed to understand whether changes in knowledge translate into more positive&#xD;
      attitudes, self-efficacy, and adherence to CR. To date, only one Canadian PE curriculum&#xD;
      within a CR setting has been empirically evaluated, and cardiac PE classes across settings&#xD;
      are often poorly described and variable in duration and format. To optimize adherence to CR&#xD;
      and its associated survival benefits, there is a need to evaluate whether a well-described&#xD;
      cardiac PE curriculum helps translate knowledge into favourable attitudes, self-efficacy, and&#xD;
      CR attendance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PRIMARY AIM: To determine the impact of a Calgary-based patient education curriculum&#xD;
      delivered in a CR setting (i.e., &quot;Taking Charge of your Heart Health&quot;; TCHH) on cardiac&#xD;
      knowledge post-TCHH and at 12-week follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY AIMS:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To examine the impact of cardiac education on attitudes toward CR, and self-efficacy for&#xD;
           CR attendance from pre- to post-TCHH&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To examine whether increases in CAD knowledge are associated with improvements in&#xD;
           attitudes toward CR, self-efficacy for CR adherence from pre- to post-TCHH oTo examine&#xD;
           whether increases in CAD knowledge from pre- to post-TCHH are associated with CR&#xD;
           adherence&#xD;
&#xD;
      HYPOTHESES: It is predicted that (1) knowledge about CAD will increase from pre- to&#xD;
      post-TCHH, and knowledge gains will be maintained at 12-weeks, and; (2) increases in&#xD;
      knowledge will be positively associated with improvements in attitudes toward CR,&#xD;
      self-efficacy toward CR participation, and actual CR adherence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODS:&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN: This is a prospective observational cohort study. As the cardiac education&#xD;
      intervention is a mandatory component of participation in the CR program, the present study&#xD;
      will observe and measure changes in CAD knowledge, CR attitudes, and CR adherence among&#xD;
      eligible CR patients who choose to participate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CR PROGRAM: The CR program consists of four mandatory 2.5-hour group-based cardiac education&#xD;
      classes (focused on physiology, risk factors, medications, nutrition, exercise, and stress&#xD;
      management) followed by 12 weeks of supervised exercise training held twice weekly. All&#xD;
      patients enrolled in the CR program are required to complete the 4 education classes prior to&#xD;
      starting CR exercise.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PROCEDURE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      â€¢ Patients will complete a baseline battery of validated questionnaires assessing CAD&#xD;
      knowledge, CR attitudes, and CR self-efficacy, as well as baseline demographic and medical&#xD;
      information prior to their first TCHH class (T1). Measures of CAD knowledge, CR attitudes,&#xD;
      and CR self-efficacy will be re-administered post-TCHH (T2), and after completion of CR&#xD;
      exercise training (12-weeks; T3).&#xD;
&#xD;
      DATA ANALYSIS: To evaluate the impact of patient education on knowledge, a repeated-measures&#xD;
      ANOVA will be performed with time as the independent variable (T1, T2, T3), and CAD knowledge&#xD;
      as the dependent variable. To evaluate the association between knowledge gains and CR&#xD;
      attitudes, self-efficacy, and CR adherence, residualized change scores will be calculated for&#xD;
      T1 to T2 knowledge, attitudes, and self-efficacy. The investigators will conduct separate&#xD;
      regression models with knowledge change scores as the independent variable, and with CR&#xD;
      attitudes change scores and CR adherence as dependent variables.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IMPLICATIONS: This study will inform strategies to help increase knowledge, and translate&#xD;
      knowledge into exercise adherence, among patients with CAD. Given the link between CR&#xD;
      attendance and morbidity/mortality, efforts to optimize patient education interventions and&#xD;
      CR utilization have the potential to significantly improve cardiovascular health outcomes.&#xD;

    <description>Beliefs and Attitudes about CR (BACR) Scales (Cooper, Weinman, Hankins, Jackson, &amp; Horne, 2007)&#xD;
13 items measured on four subscales assessing attitudes about CR (perceived necessity of CR, perceived suitability) and self-efficacy for completing CR exercise (concerns about exercise, practical barriers).&#xD;
Patients rate their agreement/disagreement with each item (e.g., &quot;Attending CR may help the long-term recovery of my heart condition&quot;) on a 5-point Likert-type scale with anchors at &quot;1&quot; (strongly disagree) and &quot;5&quot; (strongly agree).&#xD;
The BACR has established predictive validity for cardiac rehabilitation enrollment and attendance.&#xD;
Residualized change scores will be calculated to determine changes in BACR scores from pre- to post- cardiac education, and from post-education to 12-weeks (i.e., after CR exercise is complete)</description>

&#xD;
          -  Referred to and eligible for the TotalCardiology CR program following a diagnosis of&#xD;
             acute coronary syndrome (ACS). ACS patients will be targeted in this study because (a)&#xD;
             they represent the most common patient group referred to TotalCardiology (~70% of&#xD;
             referrals) and (b) patients with ACS follow an &quot;Early Cardiac Access Clinic&quot; stream at&#xD;
             TCR that involves a different schedule of exercise appointments than other patient&#xD;
             groups. Therefore recruiting ACS patients will enable a consistent CR referral and&#xD;
             intake process across all study participants.&#xD;
