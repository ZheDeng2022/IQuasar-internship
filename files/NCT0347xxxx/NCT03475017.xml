  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Many studies have been conducted to identify therapeutic strategies to modulate inflammation&#xD;
      and oxidative stress, complications that contribute to the increased morbidity and&#xD;
      cardiovascular mortality in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). Among several&#xD;
      non-pharmacological strategies, the use of bioactive compounds has emerged as a potential&#xD;
      approach to reduce these complications in CKD patients. In this context, turmeric/curcumin&#xD;
      may have positive consequences in terms of cardiovascular and nephroprotection because of its&#xD;
      antibacterial, antiviral, anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidative effects. The aim of this study&#xD;
      is the role of curcumin as a nutritional strategy to reduce cardiovascular risk factors as&#xD;
      inflammation and oxidative stress in CKD patients.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a longitudinal study of the type randomized crossover, double-blind,&#xD;
      placebo-controlled, washout period. We selected 30 patients with CKD in hemodialysis at&#xD;
      Clínica Renalcor / RJ (second sample calculation, considering p = 0.05 and test power of&#xD;
      80%). Eligible patients of both genders, previously evaluated and authorized by the medical&#xD;
      staff of the clinic, were invited to participate in the research.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research was carried out after signing the free and informed consent form, according to&#xD;
      the standards of the local Research Ethics Committees and required by Resolution 466 of&#xD;
      December 12, 2012 (Conselho Nacional de Saúde), based on the guidelines of the Declaration of&#xD;
      Helsinki and of the World Medical Association on human research. This project was approved by&#xD;
      the Ethics Committee of the Faculty of Medicine / UFF, number: 2.346.933. It is registered&#xD;
      with ClinicalTrials.gov under the number NCT 03475017.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion and exclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with stage 5 CKD (GFR &lt;15 mL / min) on hemodialysis for more than 6 months, aged at&#xD;
      least 18 years, and who had arteriovenous fistula (AVF) as vascular access were included in&#xD;
      the study. Patients who were pregnant, smokers, antibiotics in the last 3 months, antioxidant&#xD;
      supplements and habitual turmeric and / or turmeric intake, besides those with autoimmune and&#xD;
      infectious diseases, cancer, hepatic diseases and AIDS were not included in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The food intake was evaluated at the beginning and at the end of the intervention through the&#xD;
      24-h food recall technique. The analysis of total energy intake (kcal/kg), carbohydrates (%),&#xD;
      lipids (%), protein (g/kg), phosphorus (mg) and potassium (mg) were estimated using NutWin®&#xD;
      software.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessment of nutritional status Patients had their body weight (kg), height (m), arm&#xD;
      circumference (cm), waist circumference (WC) (cm) and skinfold measurements (mm) (biceps,&#xD;
      triceps, subscapular, and suprailiac) measured with the aid of calibrated balance,&#xD;
      stadiometer, tape measure and Lange Skinfold Caliper type adipometer (Cambridge Scientific&#xD;
      Industries Inc.) before and after intervention. Body mass index (BMI) was calculated from dry&#xD;
      body weight (kg) divided by squared height (m). Arm muscle area and body fat percentage were&#xD;
      calculated. All measurements were performed after the dialysis session by a trained staff&#xD;
      member.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood collection and biochemical analyzes Samples were collected in the morning after a 12-h&#xD;
      fasting before dialysis and immediately after arteriovenous fistula puncture in Vacutainer®&#xD;
      tubes containing ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid (EDTA) with anticoagulant (1.0 mg/mL).&#xD;
      After collection, an aliquot was used for the analysis with whole blood and another one was&#xD;
      centrifuged at 2500 rpm for 10 min at 4 C to obtain the plasma, which was distributed in 1.5&#xD;
      mL polypropylene eppendorfs tubes, identified and aliquoted for each analysis and stored at&#xD;
      80 C for further analysis. The whole blood was used to obtain the peripheral blood&#xD;
      mononuclear cells (PBMC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Real time PCR analysis Nrf2, NF-kB mRNA expression were evaluated from PBMC using&#xD;
      quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). TaqMan Gene Expression (Thermo&#xD;
      Fisher®) assays for the detection of Nrf2 (Hs00975961_g1), NF-kB (Hs00765730_m1), and GAPDH&#xD;
      (Hs02758991_g1) control mRNA expression were used. The Prism 7500 Sequence Detection System&#xD;
      ABI (Applied Biosystems®) and the standard cyclic conditions were used for PCR amplification.&#xD;
      NRf2, NF-kB mRNA expression were normalized against GAPDH, and the level of expressionwas&#xD;
      calculated using the DDCT (delta delta threshold cycle) method.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Biochemical parameters Relevant information such as the etiology of CKD and age were&#xD;
      collected from patients' records. Routine biochemical exams corresponding to collection&#xD;
      dates, such as urea, Kt/v, hemoglobin and albumin, serum phosphorus, potassium, parathyroid&#xD;
      hormone, glucose, and glycated hemoglobin were also obtained from routine medical records.&#xD;
      Serum levels of high sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP), total cholesterol,&#xD;
      triglycerides, c-HDL were determined using BioClin® kits using the biochemical analyzer&#xD;
      Bioclin BS-120 Chemistry Analyze. LDL was calculated using the Friedewald equation,&#xD;
      considering triglyceride values below 400 mg/dL: LDL Cholesterol ¼ (Total Cholesterol) - (HDL&#xD;
      Cholesterol) - (Triglycerides)/5.&#xD;
