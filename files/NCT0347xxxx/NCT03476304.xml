  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Caries disease is still the leading cause of severe tooth decay. Since this can lead to tooth&#xD;
      loss, it is important that appropriate treatment is advised to help prevent damage and&#xD;
      maintain tooth health. Faced with major coronary destruction, several times it becomes&#xD;
      necessary to perform the endodontic treatment, aiming to maintain the element in the buccal&#xD;
      cavity for longer. It is known that an excellent restorative treatment with poor endodontic&#xD;
      treatment and the inverse has a direct impact on the (in) success of the treatment. In this&#xD;
      context, the proper cleaning of the root canals is highlighted, aiming the removal of&#xD;
      bacteria and toxins. Acceptable restorations are those that provide adequate reestablishment&#xD;
      of anatomy, function, proximal contacts, and occlusal stability. Traditionally, indirect&#xD;
      restorations would be indicated in cases of extensive coronary destruction, because it was&#xD;
      believed that they would present greater resistance and longevity when compared to direct&#xD;
      restorations. However, contemporary dentistry admits that, thanks to adhesive and&#xD;
      conservative principles, this difference between direct and indirect procedures in terms of&#xD;
      longevity is not significant. The classic restorative procedure in cases of endodontically&#xD;
      treated teeth with great loss of coronary structure involves the use of intraradicular&#xD;
      retainers, followed by the creation of core and restoration through total crowns. Removal of&#xD;
      healthy tissue for the use of posts can weaken the remaining dental structure and increase&#xD;
      the risk of root perforations. In this sense, endocrown restorations show superiority when&#xD;
      compared to those made with intraradicular retainers. Although the indications are favorable&#xD;
      for the use of endocrown restorations, the clinical evidence available on the subject is&#xD;
      still scarce. In this double-blind randomized clinical trial, patients who need and meet the&#xD;
      inclusion criteria will will be allocated to one of the three restorative groups available,&#xD;
      being endocrown restoration in semi-direct composite resin, direct restoration in composite&#xD;
      resin retained on the post and ceramic crown retained in the post. Patients will be monitored&#xD;
      annually after completion of restorative treatment outcome. In addition to treatment&#xD;
      longevity, other secondary outcomes will be evaluated, such as patient satisfaction, impact&#xD;
      on quality of life and cost-effectiveness of the proposed treatments.&#xD;
