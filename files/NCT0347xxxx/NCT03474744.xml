    <textblock>
      For marginal zone lymphoma (MZL) Rituximab in combination with conventional chemotherapy is&#xD;
      widely used for those patients who fail local therapy or do not qualify for such. Depending&#xD;
      on the MZL subtype Rituximab/chemotherapy is able to induce in part long remissions, but do&#xD;
      not prevent relapse later on. In addition, chemotherapy associated toxicity is often&#xD;
      problematic in MZL patients, who are mostly of advanced age. Thus, chemotherapy - free&#xD;
      approaches are highly attractive for this patient group. Rituximab single agent is a widely&#xD;
      used chemotherapy - free approach in MZL, but was significantly inferior compared to&#xD;
      Rituximab/chlorambucil in a large randomized prospective clinical trial in treatment naïve&#xD;
      MZL with a CR rate of 56 % vs. 80%, respectively (P&lt;0.001). Thus, it is the major aim to&#xD;
      develop chemotherapy - free approaches for MZL, which approach efficacy of&#xD;
      Rituximab/chemotherapy combinations, but avoid chemotherapy associated toxicities. This in&#xD;
      particular important in MZL as many physicians are reluctant to treat these often elderly&#xD;
      patients with more intense treatments and prefer single agent therapies in these very often&#xD;
      well and long responding lymphoma subtype. The PI3K inhibitor Copanlisib has shown high&#xD;
      clinical activity in indolent B - cell lymphomas among them MZL. Based on these observations&#xD;
      it is the aim of this study to test the toxicity and efficacy of Copanlisib in combination&#xD;
      with the anti-CD20 antibody Rituximab in patients with newly diagnosed or relapsed MZL in&#xD;
      need of treatment, who are not eligible or failed local therapy, following the assumption&#xD;
      that this novel chemotherapy - free combination is significantly more effective than&#xD;
      Rituximab single agent therapy and at least as efficient as Rituximab/chemotherapy, but&#xD;
      avoids chemotherapy - related toxicity.&#xD;

      eligible for local therapy or relapsed after local or systemic therapy. For efficacy the rate&#xD;
      of complete remissions (according to the GELA criteria for gastric MALT or to the Cheson 2007&#xD;
      criteria for non-gastric extranodal, nodal and splenic MZL) after induction therapy will be&#xD;
      primarily analysed. For toxicity treatment associated adverse events, quality of life and&#xD;
      cumulative incidence of secondary malignancies will be documented.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients must meet all of the following inclusion criteria to be eligible for participation&#xD;
        in this study:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Confirmed CD20 positive MALT Lymphoma de novo or relapsed following or being not&#xD;
             eligible for local therapy (including surgery, radiotherapy) and antibiotics for H.&#xD;
             pylori-positive gastric lymphoma arisen at any extranodal site OR&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Confirmed CD20 positive de novo or relapsed splenic MZL following or not being&#xD;
             eligible for local therapy (including surgery and antiviral therapy for Hepatitis C&#xD;
             Virus) with symptomatic disease OR&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Confirmed CD20 positive de novo or relapsed nodal MZL Tissue diagnostic procedures&#xD;
             must be performed within 12 months prior to study entry and have to include&#xD;
             diagnostics by a reference pathology center. Biopsy material from an excisional or&#xD;
             core biopsy must be submitted for retrospective central confirmation. Tissue samples&#xD;
             dated &gt; 12 months prior to informed consent can be accepted only if tissue material is&#xD;
             available for retrospective confirmation, if there is no clinical indication for&#xD;
             transformation of disease, and if the request for additional biopsy would be unethical&#xD;
             treatment of the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
        In patients with splenic MZL without splenic tissue available for histologic review, the&#xD;
        diagnosis may be confirmed by the presence of splenomegaly and typical morphologic and&#xD;
        immunophenotypic findings in the blood and bone marrow. Bone marrow (acceptable up to 12&#xD;
        weeks before start of treatment) must be submitted for retrospective central confirmation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        - Patients in need of treatment: For patients with symptomatic splenic, nodal, or&#xD;
        non-gastric extranodal MZL disease that is de novo or has relapsed following local therapy&#xD;
        (i.e., surgery or radiotherapy) and requires therapy, as assessed by the investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
        For nodal MZL and extragastric MALT lymphoma:&#xD;
&#xD;
        - At least one bi-dimensionally measurable lesion (≥ 1.5 cm in its largest dimension by CT&#xD;
        scan or MRI). Please refer to Appendix C.&#xD;
&#xD;
        For SMZL:&#xD;
&#xD;
        For splenic MZL, an enlarged spleen on CT scan and lymphoma cell infiltration has to be&#xD;
        seen in bone marrow and/or peripheral blood. Please refer also to Appendix E.&#xD;
&#xD;

             or bone marrow infiltration)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  SMZL with concomitant hepatitis C infection which has not responded to or has relapsed&#xD;
             after Interferon and/or Ribavirin and/or direct antiviral agents (patients positive&#xD;
             for HCV antibody are eligible only if PCR is negative for HCV RNA).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  splenectomised patients with rapidly raising lymphocyte counts, development of&#xD;
             lymphadenopathy or involvement of extranodal sites if not being eligible for local&#xD;

&#xD;
        For gastric MALT lymphoma:&#xD;
&#xD;
        For gastric MALT lymphoma, the clinical evidence of the MZL as seen by gastroendoscopy is&#xD;
        sufficient. There is no need to show a measurable lesion by CT scan or MRI. Please refer to&#xD;
