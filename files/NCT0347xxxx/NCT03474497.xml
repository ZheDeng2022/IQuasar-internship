  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase I/II study that will evaluate the safety and toxicity of this combinatorial&#xD;
      approach. Eligible patients &gt;18 years of age with histologically proven metastatic NSCLC,&#xD;
      melanoma, RCC, or HNSCC who have failed PD-1 / PD-L1 checkpoint blockade therapy will be&#xD;
      enrolled. Patients must have a candidate treatment lesion (subcutaneous, nodal, or visceral)&#xD;
      accessible and safe for radiotherapy and serial intralesional injections as specified by the&#xD;
      protocol. They must also have at least one target lesion (distinct from treatment lesion and&#xD;
      outside of treatment lesion radiation field) evaluable for response by RECIST.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will consist of a phase I dose escalation using a standard 3+3 design to determine&#xD;
      safety and MTD of intralesional IL-2 which will be dose escalated in conjunction with&#xD;
      standard fixed doses of RT and Pembrolizumab. At the MTD there will be a phase II dose&#xD;
      expansion which will incorporate a simon-two stage design to assess efficacy and safety.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will receive pembrolizumab and intralesional IL-2 in combination with&#xD;
      hypofractionated radiotherapy.&#xD;

&#xD;
      Patients will receive pembrolizumab and intralesional IL-2 in combination with&#xD;
      hypofractionated radiotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Radiotherapy will be delivered to the treatment lesion during the second cycle of&#xD;
           therapy using an 8 Gy x 3 fractions palliative regimen. Fractions may be delivered on&#xD;
           consecutive or every other day but must be completed during week 1-2 of cycle 2 and will&#xD;
           not be repeated in future cycles.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pembrolizumab will be delivered at 200 mg in three week cycles per standard protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A total of four interleukin-2 treatments will be delivered into the treatment lesion by&#xD;
           intralesional injection biweekly (at least 48 hours apart) starting 24-96 hours after&#xD;
           the completion of radiotherapy and to be completed during the second on-trial cycle of&#xD;
           Pembrolizumab. Intralesional injections will be performed by direct visualization and/or&#xD;
           palpation of the lesion or under ultrasound or CT guidance as indicated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be assessed by a physician once during the first week of radiotherapy, during&#xD;
      each intralesional IL-2 injection, and with every cycle of pembrolizumab during the first&#xD;
      three cycles. Thereafter patients will be assessed every 30 days during the study period and&#xD;
      will continue until disease progression. All patients on active treatment will be discussed&#xD;
      at weekly conferences of the trial investigators. Routine laboratory evaluation will occur&#xD;
      pre-treatment and every 30 days. For response assessment patient will have imaging&#xD;
      pre-treatment and after every three cycles of Pembrolizumab. For collateral studies patients&#xD;
      will undergo mandatory treatment lesion biopsies and blood draws pre-treatment and during the&#xD;
      needle placement for the final IL-2 treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preliminary efficacy as determined by abscopal response rate, ORR, DCR and PFS will be&#xD;
      assessed every 3 cycles. The patient will remain on protocol treatment until progression as&#xD;
      determined by irRECIST, treatment is no longer tolerated, or the patient has completed 12&#xD;
      months of treatment. Patients on active treatment at 12 months may continue to receive&#xD;
      pembrolizumab but will revert to standard of care (SOC) management and be labeled in &quot;follow&#xD;
      up&quot;. At this time only PFS and long-term toxicity data will be collected every 3 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary endpoint is to determine if this regimen converts patients with resistance to PD&#xD;
      1/PD-L1 checkpoint blockade into responders as determined by abscopal response rate (defined&#xD;
      as response rate at lesions not treated with RT + IL-2) using irRECIST as well as ORR, DCR,&#xD;
      and PFS using RECIST 1.1. The secondary endpoint is tolerability, safety, and toxicity using&#xD;
      CTCAE v4.03. Correlative studies include immunophenotyping serial tumor biopsies and blood&#xD;
      samples.&#xD;
