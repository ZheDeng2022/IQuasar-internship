    <textblock>
      This randomized trial with a crossover design will examine the efficacy of rTMS targeting the&#xD;
      dorsomedial prefrontal cortex as a treatment for medication-resistant major depression in&#xD;
      patients meeting diagnostic criteria for borderline personality disorder.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients meeting standard DSM-5 diagnostic criteria for borderline personality disorder, who&#xD;
      also meet diagnostic criteria for a major depressive episode that has not responded to&#xD;
      medication, will be eligible for inclusion. In a study with a randomized crossover design,&#xD;
      they will undergo a course of either either active followed by sham or sham followed by&#xD;
      active treatment. Each phase (active or sham) will involve 15 days of rTMS targeting the&#xD;
      bilateral dorsomedial prefrontal cortex, 5x weekly, twice-daily with sessions 1 hour apart,&#xD;
      using 20 Hz stimulation. Followup visits will occur at 1, 4, and 12 weeks after both courses&#xD;
      of treatment.&#xD;
