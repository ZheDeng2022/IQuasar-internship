      Phase I randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in 50 males and non-pregnant&#xD;
      females, 18 to 49 years old, who are in good health and meet all eligibility criteria. This&#xD;
      clinical trial is designed to assess the safety, reactogenicity, and immunogenicity of&#xD;
      inactivated A/H5N1 influenza vaccine administered intradermally (ID) with topical Aldara or&#xD;
      control cream as a 2-dose regimen. The vaccine will be administered using the&#xD;
      MicronJet600(TM) device. Subjects will be assigned to 2 treatment arms (25 subjects per&#xD;
      treatment arm). Group A will receive two doses of A/H5N1 IIV ID with pre-application of&#xD;
      topical Aldara on Days 1 and 22. Group B will receive two doses of A/H5N1 IIV ID with&#xD;
      pre-application of topical control cream on Days 1 and 22. The duration of this study will be&#xD;
      approximately 20 months with patient participation duration approximately 7 months. The&#xD;
      primary objectives of this study are: 1) to assess the safety and reactogenicity after 2&#xD;
      doses of A/H5N1 IIV vaccine containing 9 mcg HA per dose administered ID approximately 21&#xD;
      days apart with topical Aldara or control cream; 2) to assess the serum HAI antibody&#xD;
      responses 21 days after receipt of the 2nd dose of A/H5N1 IIV administered ID at 9 mcg HA per&#xD;
      dose with topical Aldara or control cream.&#xD;

      This is a Phase I randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in 50 males and&#xD;
      non-pregnant females, 18 to 49 years old, inclusive, who are in good health and meet all&#xD;
      eligibility criteria. This clinical trial is designed to assess the safety, reactogenicity,&#xD;
      and immunogenicity of inactivated A/H5N1 influenza vaccine administered intradermally (ID)&#xD;
      with topical Aldara or control cream as a 2-dose regimen. The vaccine will be administered&#xD;
      using the MicronJet600(TM) device. Subjects will be assigned randomly to 1 of 2 treatment&#xD;
      arms (25 subjects per treatment arm) to receive 2 doses of A/H5N1 IIV administered ID with&#xD;
      topical Aldara or control cream. Group A will receive two doses of A/H5N1 IIV (9 mcg HA/dose)&#xD;
      ID with pre-application of topical Aldara on Days 1 and 22. Group B will receive two doses of&#xD;
      A/H5N1 IIV (9 mcg HA/dose) ID with pre-application of topical control cream on Days 1 and 22.&#xD;
      The duration of this study will be approximately 20 months with patient participation&#xD;
      duration approximately 7 months. The primary objectives of this study are: 1) to assess the&#xD;
      safety and reactogenicity after 2 doses of A/H5N1 IIV vaccine containing 9 mcg HA per dose&#xD;

      assess the serum HAI antibody responses 21 days after receipt of the 2nd dose of A/H5N1 IIV&#xD;
      administered ID at 9 mcg HA per dose with topical Aldara or control cream. The secondary&#xD;
      objectives are: 1) to assess unsolicited non-serious adverse events (AEs) following receipt&#xD;
      of 2 doses of A/H5N1 IIV administered ID approximately 21 days apart with topical Aldara or&#xD;
      control cream; 2) to assess medically-attended adverse events (MAAEs) including new-onset&#xD;
      chronic medical conditions (NOCMCs), and potentially immune mediated medical conditions&#xD;
      (PIMMCs) following receipt of two doses of A/H5N1 IIV administered ID approximately 21 days&#xD;
      apart with topical Aldara or control cream for six months after last vaccination; 3) to&#xD;
      assess the serum neutralizing (Neut) antibody responses 21 days following receipt of the 1st&#xD;
      and 2nd dose of A/H5N1 IIV administered ID with topical Aldara or control cream; 4) to assess&#xD;
      the serum HAI antibody responses 21 days following receipt of the 1st dose of A/H5N1 IIV&#xD;
      administered ID with topical Aldara or control cream; 5) to assess the serum HAI and Neut&#xD;
      antibody responses 7 days following receipt of the 2nd dose of A/H5N1 IIV administered ID&#xD;
      with topical Aldara or control cream.&#xD;

             A/H5 actual or potential exposure or infection prior to the first study vaccination.&#xD;
&#xD;
             - Assigned to a group receiving influenza A/H5 vaccine (does not apply to documented&#xD;
             placebo recipients)&#xD;
&#xD;
         21. Plan to travel outside the U.S. (continental U.S., Hawaii and Alaska) in the time&#xD;
             between the first study vaccination and 21 days after the last study vaccination.&#xD;
&#xD;
         22. Female subjects who are breastfeeding.&#xD;
&#xD;
         23. Blood donation or planned blood donation within 30 days prior to the study vaccination&#xD;
             through 30 days after the last blood drawn for this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
         24. Have signs or symptoms that could confound or confuse assessment of study vaccine&#xD;
             reactogenicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
             - The study vaccination should be postponed/deferred until signs or symptoms have&#xD;
             resolved and if within the acceptable protocol-specified window for that visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
         25. Receiving or planning to receive Aldara, imiquimod or resiquimod for any clinical&#xD;
             indication during the duration of study participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
         26. Patients with autoimmune skin diseases such as psoriasis or atopic dermatitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
         27. Known allergy to Aldara or its components, and/or to aqueous cream B.P.&#xD;
&#xD;
             - Methyl hydroxybenzoate (E 218) and propyl hydroxybenzoate (E 216) may cause allergic&#xD;
             reactions (possibly delayed). Cetyl alcohol and stearyl alcohol may cause local skin&#xD;
             reactions (e.g. contact dermatitis).&#xD;
&#xD;
             -- Liquid paraffin, white soft paraffin, cetostearyl alcohol, sodium lauryl sulfate,&#xD;
             phenoxyethanol may cause local skin reactions (e.g. contact dermatitis).&#xD;
&#xD;
         28. Presence of large or dark tattoos on the deltoid area that would significantly&#xD;
             interfere with reactogenicity assessment.&#xD;
