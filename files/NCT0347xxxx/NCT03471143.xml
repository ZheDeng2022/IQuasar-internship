  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Niemann-Pick disease, type C (NPC) is a lethal, autosomal recessive, lysosomal storage&#xD;
      disorder characterized by neurodegeneration in early childhood and death in adolescence. NPC&#xD;
      results from mutation of either the Niemann-Pick C1 disease (NPC1) (~95% of cases) or NPC2&#xD;
      genes. NPC is characterized by the endolysosomal storage of unesterified cholesterol and&#xD;
      lipids in both the central nervous system and peripheral tissues such as the liver.&#xD;
      Individuals with NPC demonstrate progressive central nervous system decline including&#xD;
      inability to coordinate balance, gait, extremity and eye movements. Acute liver disease in&#xD;
      the newborn/infant period is frequently observed, but subsequently resolves. However,&#xD;
      chronic, sub-clinical liver disease persists. Intrathecal 2-Hydroxypropyl-β-Cyclodextrin&#xD;
      (HP-β-CD, VTS-270) has proven effective in reducing the signs and prolonging life in animal&#xD;
      models and Phase 1/2a data support efficacy in NPC1 patients. VTS-270 also has been shown to&#xD;
      be effective in treating liver disease in the NPC1 cat.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This Phase 1/2a, open-label, multiple ascending dose trial will evaluate whether VTS-270&#xD;
      administered intravenously is effective in treating acute liver disease in NPC1 infants.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In the first phase of the study, infants will be treated for a total of 6 weeks, treated&#xD;
      twice weekly. Infants will be admitted to the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) for the&#xD;
      first week of treatment. Procedures during the first week of the study will include blood&#xD;
      draws for genetic testing, clinical and research blood draws, urine collection, abdominal&#xD;
      ultrasound, peripheral inserted central catheter (PICC) placement, hearing screening, and the&#xD;
      first two IV VTS-270 infusions through the PICC line. Weeks 2-6 will occur on an outpatient&#xD;
      basis. During week 2-6, the infant will receive 2 doses per week of VTS-270 with blood draws&#xD;
      and urine collection during weeks 2, 4, and 6. PICC line will be removed after final&#xD;
      infusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects who demonstrate significant reduction either in the glycine-conjugated&#xD;
      trihydroxycholanic acid biomarker or serum bilirubin (direct bilirubin or direct bilirubin:&#xD;
      total bilirubin ratio) will be allowed to crossover into the second phase of the study, an&#xD;
      open label phase of six months duration in which IV VTS-270 will be administered monthly for&#xD;
      a total of six doses. Month 1-6 procedures will occur on an outpatient basis. Procedures&#xD;
      during the second phase include a monthly intravenous line placement. After each monthly&#xD;
      visit, the intravenous line will be removed.&#xD;
