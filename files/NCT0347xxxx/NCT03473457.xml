      Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a group of genetically highly heterogeneous malignant disease&#xD;
      ,its' character is immature myeloid protocel abnormal differentiation and proliferation in&#xD;
      the bone marrow. The disease is the most common type of adult acute leukemia, Overall&#xD;
      survival (OS) was less than 50% in 5 years. Chimeric Antigen Receptor-transduced T cell&#xD;
      (CAR-T) therapy is one of revolutionary targeted immunotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CAR - T cells are taken in the form of genetic modification, and specific identified target&#xD;
      antigen monoclonal antibody of single variable region (scFv) expression in T cell surface,&#xD;
      and coupled with the activation of intracellular proliferation signal domain.When scFv&#xD;
      recognizes antigens expressed in malignant cells, it stimulates the activation signal of&#xD;
      downstream T cells and produces specific killing effects. CAR-T therapy is one of&#xD;
      revolutionary targeted immunotherapy.The efficacy of CAR-T cells for the treatment of acute B&#xD;
      lymphocytic leukemia has been widely recognized, although it start late, several clinical&#xD;
      trials have been register in ClinicalTrials.gov.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The cluster of differentiation (CD) antigen serves as the target for identification and&#xD;
      research in the immuno-phenotype detection of cells.As the surface markers of immune typing,&#xD;
      CD molecules can be used as cell identification for expression types and levels on the cell&#xD;
      surface.Cell surface of AML has a specific type of CD molecule expression,such as cluster of&#xD;
      differentiation antigen 33(CD33),cluster of differentiation 38(CD38),cluster of&#xD;
      differentiation 56 (CD56), cluster of differentiation 123(CD123), cluster of differentiation&#xD;
      117(CD117), cluster of differentiation 133(CD133), cluster of differentiation 34(CD34) and&#xD;
      Mucl.Therefore, it provides some good targets for the immunotherapy of CAR T cells.In AML&#xD;
      cells and mouse model,some studies have confirmed anti-CD33 CAR-T and anti-CD123 CAR-T with&#xD;
      good similar lethality, but the toxicity of CAR-T to myeloid hematopoietic stem/progenitor&#xD;
      cells and mononuclear cells is widespread.In comparison,CD123 CAR-T Off-target effects&#xD;
      slighter than CD33 CAR-T.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to lay a foundation for the application of relapsed/refractory AML patients with&#xD;
      CAR-T therapy，objects are refractory/ relapsed patients with AML,and plans to into the group&#xD;
      of the number of cases in 50 cases.The main content is safety, efficacy and feasibility&#xD;
      analysis of the CAR-T cells （single CAR-T or double CAR-T cells with&#xD;
      CD33,CD38,CD56,CD123,CD117,CD133,CD34 or Mucl ) in the treatment of refractory/relapsed AML.&#xD;
