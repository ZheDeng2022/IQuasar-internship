      The aim of the study is to evaluate adenoidectomy with bilateral partial tonsillectomy&#xD;
      compared with adenoidectomy with classical unilateral complete tonsillectomy for management&#xD;
      of pediatric Obstructive Sleep-Disordered Breathing (OSDB) in terms of efficacy of the&#xD;
      technique and reducing postoperative complications.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Tonsillectomy is one of commonly performed pediatric otorhinolaryngology surgeries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The two main indications of tonsillectomy in children include recurrent tonsillitis and&#xD;
      Obstructive Sleep-Disordered Breathing (OSDB); including obstructive sleep apnea and upper&#xD;
      airway resistance syndrome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Total tonsillectomy means total removal of the tonsillar tissue with the tonsillar capsule.&#xD;
      The main drawbacks of tonsillectomy are the potential for serious postoperative bleeding,&#xD;
      postoperative pain, eating and drinking difficulties, and reduced immune function in the&#xD;
      early stages after the operation. Partial tonsillectomy (intracapsular tonsillectomy,&#xD;
      subtotal tonsillectomy) means subtotal removal of tonsillar tissue, leaving a margin of&#xD;
      tissue on the tonsillar capsule . In contrast to complete tonsil removal, Partial&#xD;
      tonsillectomy does not violate the capsule, and leaves lymphoid tissue as a protective tissue&#xD;
      on the pharyngeal muscle layer thus preserving of the connective tissue capsule and&#xD;
      pharyngeal muscles. This diminishes the direct and indirect trauma during an intraoperative&#xD;
      procedure and the inflammation due to secondary infection during the postoperative period.&#xD;
      Recently, children with OSDB have benefited from the less invasive partial tonsillectomy with&#xD;
      less pain, equivalent or easier recovery, better food intake, and maintain the immunological&#xD;
      function of the tonsils, while being as effective as tonsillectomy for resolving upper-airway&#xD;
      obstructive symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Many studies have evaluated the outcomes of the two techniques, but uncertainty remains with&#xD;
      regard to the efficacy, complications and long term outcomes. Some studies have reported the&#xD;
      recurrence of obstructive symptoms due to regrowth of the remaining tonsillar tissue. Thus,&#xD;
      it is important to evaluate Partial tonsillectomy comprehensively, especially paying&#xD;
      attention to short-term and long-term results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Over the last years, unilateral complete tonsillectomy (usually combined with adenoidectomy)&#xD;
      was the most commonly utilized procedure for treatment of pediatric obstructive&#xD;
      sleep-disordered breathing below the age of four years old in Otorhinolaryngology Department,&#xD;
      Assiut University&#xD;

    <description>The CRIES scale is used for infants &gt; than or = 38 weeks of gestation. Characteristics of crying, oxygen requirement, changes in vital signs, facial expression, and sleep state are scored. A maximal score of 10 is possible. If the CRIES score is &gt; 4, further pain assessment should be undertaken, and analgesic administration is indicated for a score of 6 or higher.</description>
