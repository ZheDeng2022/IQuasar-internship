  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Obesity is a wide reaching problem in the United Kingdom. The most widely used obesity&#xD;
      therapies are based around drugs that reduce dietary fat digestion, and thereby reduce uptake&#xD;
      of calories from the diet. While such therapies have proved effective, patient compliance is&#xD;
      low due to the unwanted gastrointestinal side effects of these drugs. Dietary fibre is&#xD;
      generally classified as dietary material of plant origin that is indigestible to humans.&#xD;
      Dietary fibre is in fact a wide range of different compounds that have varied effects on the&#xD;
      human body. Initial findings from this laboratory suggest that some types of fibre can&#xD;
      greatly reduce the rate that fat is digested and absorbed in the gut.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Whether such fibre-based test foods are acceptable (i.e. taste good, are easy to include in&#xD;
      the diet and do not cause any unwanted gastrointestinal side effects) will be assessed in&#xD;
      longer term studies. To carry these studies out, healthy adults will be recruited.&#xD;
      Participants will attend an induction visit and will be asked to keep a food diary, and fill&#xD;
      out daily questionnaires on general well-being and feelings of fullness over a two-week&#xD;
      period whilst consuming the standard white bread given to them. Following this two-week&#xD;
      period, participants will attend the study centre again. At this time, participants will be&#xD;
      provided with dietary fibre-based study food (bread) to substitute into their standard diet&#xD;
      over the following two weeks (further bread will be provided as and when required).&#xD;
      Participants will fill out the same diaries and questionnaires as before over the first two&#xD;
      week period.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to test the acceptability of fibre-based foods in terms of their&#xD;
      palatability, ease of incorporation into the diet and the lack of unwanted side effects of&#xD;
      consumption. To meet these aims, participants will be provided with bread to incorporate into&#xD;
      their diet (by substituting like-for-like) over a two-week period. During this time,&#xD;
      participants will record what they have eaten, along with their general feelings of&#xD;
      well-being throughout this period. These measures will be compared to the same data collected&#xD;
      over the two-week period prior to giving the participants the study foods (as a &quot;background&quot;&#xD;
      measure of food intake and general well-being).&#xD;
&#xD;
      To carry these studies out, healthy adults will be recruited. Participants will attend an&#xD;
      induction visit at Newcastle University where we will take informed consent. Participants&#xD;
      will then be asked to keep a food diary, and fill out daily questionnaires on their general&#xD;
      well-being and feelings of fullness for the entirety of the following two weeks whilst&#xD;
      consuming the standard white bread given to them. Following this two-week period,&#xD;
      participants will attend the study centre again and will be provided with dietary fibre-based&#xD;
      study food (breads) to substitute into their standard diet over the following two weeks&#xD;
      (further foods will be provided as and when required). They will fill out the same diaries&#xD;
      and questionnaires as they did before over the first two week period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The wellbeing questionnaire will be filled out by participants every day with a more detailed&#xD;
      questionnaire completed at the end of each week. Volunteers will complete the more detailed&#xD;
      questionnaire five times. Once at the start of the study (baseline) and then at then once at&#xD;
      the end of each week consuming standard white bread and once at the end of each week&#xD;
      consuming the alginate bread. The standard wellbeing questionnaire will be completed every&#xD;
      day the volunteers are on the study.&#xD;
