    <textblock>
      This phase I trial studies the side effects of anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibody REGN2810&#xD;
      (REGN2810) and/or ipilimumab when given together with stereotactic body radiation therapy&#xD;
      before surgery in treating participants with prostate cancer that is growing, spreading, or&#xD;
      getting worse, and has spread to other places in the body, or formed a small number of new&#xD;
      tumors in one or two other parts of the body. Monoclonal antibodies, such as anti-PD-1&#xD;
      monoclonal antibody REGN2810 and ipilimumab, may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to&#xD;
      grow and spread. Stereotactic body radiation therapy is a specialized radiation therapy that&#xD;
      sends x-rays directly to the tumor using smaller doses over several days and may cause less&#xD;
      damage to normal tissue. Giving anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibody REGN2810 and ipilimumab with&#xD;
      stereotactic body radiation therapy before surgery may make the tumor smaller and reduce the&#xD;
      amount of normal tissue that needs to be removed.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the safety and tolerability for an established effective dose of systemic&#xD;
      REGN2810 and intraprostatic ipilimumab with stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) in&#xD;
      patients with locally advanced prostate cancer with or without oligometastatic disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine overall pathologic response rate after radical prostatectomy. II. To&#xD;
      determine prostate-specific antigen (PSA) progression free survival in men treated with&#xD;
      REGN2810 and intraprostatic ipilimumab with SBRT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To determine radiographic progression free survival in men treated with REGN2810 and&#xD;
      intraprostatic ipilimumab with SBRT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. Acute and chronic adverse events (AEs).&#xD;
