  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Kidney transplantation is a good treatment option for people with kidney disease. However,&#xD;
      there is still much to learn about how to best care for the transplanted kidney and keep it&#xD;
      functioning for a long time. Transplant recipients receive induction therapy and&#xD;
      immunosuppression (anti-rejection) drugs to prevent their body from rejecting the new kidney.&#xD;
      These drugs are used to prevent the immune system from attacking the transplanted kidney.&#xD;
      This research study will evaluate the safety and activity of mesenchymal stromal stem cells&#xD;
      (MSCs) infusion compared to saline-only infusion in reducing the immune suppression necessary&#xD;
      to achieve optimal renal function in renal transplant recipients. All participants will&#xD;
      receive routine care: basiliximab, tacrolimus, mycophenolate mofetil, and corticosteroids.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is a double-blind, randomized, controlled, dose-escalation and safety study of the&#xD;
      investigational product, autologous MSCs, to be assessed for inducing immune suppression in&#xD;
      living donor kidney transplant recipients as compared to saline, the placebo infusion. The&#xD;
      investigator will obtain exploratory immune response markers to estimate the effect of&#xD;
      autologous MSCs on the T- and B-cell response following living donor kidney transplantation.&#xD;
      The usual routine care supportive drugs will be given to all: corticosteroids during&#xD;
      induction, the calcineurin inhibitor tacrolimus (Prograf®, Astellas Pharma), and&#xD;
      mycophenolate mofetil (Cellcept®, Genentech) for maintenance therapy. All subjects will&#xD;
      receive basiliximab (Simulect®, Novartis), a standard drug used to induce immune suppression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 24 patients will be enrolled at the Houston Methodist Hospital. Safety analyses will be&#xD;
      conducted after the first 4 subjects have been enrolled and completed the first 30-90 days&#xD;
      posttransplant, with subject 2 enrolled 30 days after subject 1 and subject 3 enrolled 30&#xD;
      days after subject 2 (eg, a 30-day window between subject enrollment days). If no safety&#xD;
      signal has been detected, the next group of 4 subjects will be enrolled using no less than a&#xD;
      2-week enrollment window from subject 5, 2 weeks from subject 6, and so on. Subjects will be&#xD;
      evaluated in the same manner until 8 subjects in the final dosing group have completed 90&#xD;
      days or a decision to stop the study has occurred, whichever comes first. Each subsequent&#xD;
      dosing group will begin with a 30-day window of evaluation between subjects enrolled for the&#xD;
      first 4 subjects enrolled in the group. If no adverse safety signal has been detected in the&#xD;
      first 4 cases in that dosing group, the next 4 subjects enrolled will have a 2-week&#xD;
      evaluation window between enrollments. This early evaluation approach will allow for the&#xD;
      assessment of the inflammatory period occurring after transplantation. A final safety review&#xD;
      will occur at the end of the study and a report will be written.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will provide information needed to select a MSC dose level to be used in subsequent&#xD;
      clinical trials and to inform the design of subsequent trials.&#xD;

    <description>Infusional toxicity will be assessed as the occurrence of either 1) two or more participants having deep vein thrombosis (Grade 2 thrombotic event); 2) any participant having evidence of the first-pass phenomenon of cells trapping in the lung as evidenced by (a) shortness of breath at rest, (b) requiring ventilator support, or (c) pulmonary edema with hypoxia requiring support; or 3) Grade 4 hypertension or hypotension; or 4) acute myocardial infarction; or 5) new onset congestive heart failure; or 6) capillary leak syndrome; or 7) acute kidney injury; or 8) biopsy-proven rejection.</description>

    <measure>Number of participants without any acute rejection, graft loss, or death at 6 months post transplant.</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months post transplant</time_frame>
    <description>Rejection will be determined as biopsy-proven allograft rejection (BPAR). Graft loss will be counted when the patient loses kidney function to the point that they require chronic renal replacement therapy (e.g., dialysis for more than 8 weeks or a re-transplant).</description>
