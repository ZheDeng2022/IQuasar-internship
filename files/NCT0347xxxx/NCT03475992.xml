  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The trialed investigational medical imaging device is a low-power microwave breast imaging&#xD;
      system for cancer screening purposes. It is an active device which uses non-ionizing&#xD;
      radiation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Microwave imaging is an emerging imaging modality for the early detection of the breast&#xD;
      cancer. The physical basis of microwave imaging is the dielectric contrast between healthy&#xD;
      and cancerous breast tissues at microwave frequencies. Microwave imaging can potentially be&#xD;
      used for monitoring neoadjuvant chemotherapy treatment, breast health monitoring, and for&#xD;
      routine screening and diagnosis of the breast cancer at the early-stage. The non-invasive and&#xD;
      the non-ionizing characteristics of microwaves should allow for frequent scans of the breast&#xD;
      using microwave imaging, unlike X-ray mammography. In addition to safety, microwave imaging&#xD;
      does not require uncomfortable breast compression and it is potentially a lower-cost&#xD;
      modality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a first-in-human clinical test of the investigational device, which has been so far&#xD;
      tested only with experimental phantoms modelling the human female breast.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The clinical data that will be collected in the context of this study is intended to provide&#xD;
      early safety information for the investigational medical imaging device. In addition, this&#xD;
      exploratory data will guide the refinement of the device hardware and the imaging algorithm&#xD;
      design, before decision to proceed (or not) with further clinical tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Furthermore, this study will be used to guide sample size calculation for a subsequent study&#xD;
      designed to evaluate efficacy should that appear warranted once this study is completed.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-site early-phase pilot clinical study, taking place at Galway University&#xD;
      Hospital/HRB Clinical Research Facility, Galway.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will have a conventional history and breast examinations (Mammogram and / or&#xD;
      Ultrasound and Clinical assessment) performed by the physician, as per normal practice in the&#xD;
      Symptomatic Breast Unit of University Hospital Galway.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If patients are interested in the study, provide written informed consent and are deemed&#xD;
      eligible, they will attend the Clinical Research Facility Galway for a Microwave Breast&#xD;
      Imaging (MBI) scan. The data from the scan will be collected and stored securely. Patients&#xD;
      will be followed up 7-21 days after the microwave breast investigation or before surgery,&#xD;
      whichever comes first. Patients will be assessed for their experience of the microwave breast&#xD;
      investigation, and for any adverse events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigational medical imaging device consists of two subsystems, both performing a&#xD;
      non-invasive examination:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  the Microwave Breast Imaging subsystem (MBI subsystem);&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  the Optical Breast Contour Detection subsystem (OBCD subsystem);&#xD;
&#xD;
      The MBI subsystem is an active device which uses non-ionizing radiation. It illuminates the&#xD;
      breast with low-power electromagnetic waves in the microwave frequency spectrum, which&#xD;
      penetrate the breast under examination. The subsystem collects the scattered electromagnetic&#xD;
      waves and recovers useful information on the breast tissue consistency, given the dielectric&#xD;
      contrast of these tissues.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Multi-static radar detection technology is employed in the MBI subsystem for breast image&#xD;
      formation.The well-established Microwave Vision Group (MVG) technology for fast antenna&#xD;
      measurement, using multiple sensors in a vertical arch configuration, has been transposed to&#xD;
      a horizontal arch of sensors. In addition, vertical translation of the horizontal arch has&#xD;
      been enabled, such that 3D multi-static short-range radar imaging is possible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sensors are in contact with a cylindrical container filled with a liquid; the so-called&#xD;
      coupling liquid has been designed to have electromagnetic (EM) properties appropriately&#xD;
      selected such that the EM wave penetration in the breast is maximized.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the MBI scan, the patient is lying in a face down position on a special bed,&#xD;
      integrated with the MBI subsystem. The breast under examination is immersed in the coupling&#xD;
      liquid, through a dedicated circular opening of the bed. The breast is then scanned. This&#xD;
      vertical scan takes approximately 10-15 minutes to complete, depending on the size of each&#xD;
      breast.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to compute the required volume of coupling liquid, such that the container of the&#xD;
      MBI subsystem is optimally filled after immersion of the breast, a simple process for optical&#xD;
      assessment of the total volume of the breast takes place just before starting the MBI scan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Optical Breast Contour Detection (OBCD) subsystem serves to provide the total volume of&#xD;
      the breast, and also its external contour, as a priori information to the MBI subsystem. The&#xD;
      OBCD subsystem consists of a 3D optical camera placed below the examination table, at a&#xD;
      distance of several tens of centimetres below the breast. An azimuthal scan of the 3D camera&#xD;
      permits to reconstruct the external surface of the breast.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order for the breast contour to be a useful a priori information for the MBI subsystem, it&#xD;
      is important that the patient is lying in the same face down position during both the MBI and&#xD;
      OBCD scans. Thus, an identical examination table, as the one integrated with the MBI&#xD;
      subsystem, is also integrated with the OBCD subsystem. During the OBCD scan, the patient is&#xD;
      lying on the examination table, with her breast under examination inserted in the circular&#xD;
      opening of the examination table. For this scan, there is no coupling liquid; the breast is&#xD;
      in the air, hanging below the examination table.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both the breast bearing the palpable lump and the contralateral breast will be scanned. The&#xD;
      contralateral breast scan will serve as control in the data analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The MBI scan duration of each breast should not exceed 15 minutes. The recorded data will be&#xD;
      checked and in the case of non-optimal positioning of the patient, the scan may be repeated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is expected that the duration of the microwave breast investigation (including OBCD scan&#xD;
      of both breasts for breast volume assessment, preparation of the MBI subsystem, MBI scan of&#xD;
      both breasts, and data verification) should not exceed 1 hour. If the Data Quality Check&#xD;
      suggests repetition of the MBI scan, and upon agreement by the patient, the total duration of&#xD;
      the microwave breast investigation will be extended.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The written radiology reports from conventional imaging will be acquired and used to evaluate&#xD;
      the performance of the MBI subsystem in terms of detecting and estimating the size and&#xD;
      consistency of the breast lump.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MBI data analysis will be performed off-line, at MVG premises (France), and is expected to be&#xD;
      completed few months after the end-date of data collection. Following the assessment of the&#xD;
      MBI results by the medical experts involved in the study, a decision will be made regarding&#xD;
      the potential of this emerging imaging modality and the interest in proceeding with clinical&#xD;
      studies involving larger sample sizes. Based on these results, MVG will decide and plan&#xD;
      actions for refinement of the system, towards an upgraded version to be used for potential&#xD;
      future tests with a more significant impact.&#xD;
