  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the short-term antiviral potency of&#xD;
      GS-9131 functional monotherapy compared to placebo-to-match (PTM) GS-9131, each administered&#xD;
      once daily with the existing failing antiretroviral (ARV) regimen as demonstrated by the&#xD;
      proportion of participants achieving human immunodeficiency virus ribonucleic acid (HIV-1&#xD;
      RNA) &gt; 0.5 log10 decreases from baseline after up to 14 days of therapy in HIV-1 positive,&#xD;
      ARV treatment experienced adult participants with nucleos(t)ide resistant virus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a two-part study. Part 1 consists of three cohorts: 2 Sentinel Cohorts and 1&#xD;
      Randomized Cohort. Eligible participants from Part 1 will proceed to Part 2 followed by an&#xD;
      optional open-label extension.&#xD;

    <description>Treatment emergent virological failure was defined as an event with an onset date on or after the study drug start date and no later than 30 days after permanent discontinuation of the study drug. Virologic failure was defined as virologic rebound or as suboptimal virologic response in relation to pre-GS-9131 baseline plasma HIV-1 RNA levels. Virological rebound was defined as if participant at any visit after achieving HIV-1 RNA &lt; 50 copies/mL, a rebound in HIV-1 RNA ≥ 50 copies/mL, or a &gt;1 log10 increase in HIV-1 RNA from the nadir which was subsequently confirmed at the following scheduled or unscheduled visit. Suboptimal virologic response was defined as plasma HIV-1 RNA ≥ 200 copies/mL and reduction in HIV-1 RNA ≤ 1 log10 from pre-GS-9131 baseline at the Week 8 visit with confirmation at the next scheduled or unscheduled visit.</description>

    <participant_flow>
      <recruitment_details>Participants were enrolled at study sites in Uganda and Zimbawe. The first participant was screened on 03 April 2018. The last study visit occurred on 09 December 2019.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>88 participants were screened. The study was conducted in 2 parts. The Part 1 consisted of 3 cohorts- 2 Sentinel Cohorts and 1 Randomized Cohort and Part 2 consisted of 2 Sentinel Cohorts only. The Randomized Cohort in Part 1 was not initiated. The study was terminated because a majority of Sentinel Cohort 2 (Part 1) participants did not meet primary endpoint of human immunodeficiency virus ribonucleic acid (HIV-1 RNA) &gt; 0.5 log10 decrease from baseline in through up to 14 days of therapy.</pre_assignment_details>

        <description>Treatment emergent virological failure was defined as an event with an onset date on or after the study drug start date and no later than 30 days after permanent discontinuation of the study drug. Virologic failure was defined as virologic rebound or as suboptimal virologic response in relation to pre-GS-9131 baseline plasma HIV-1 RNA levels. Virological rebound was defined as if participant at any visit after achieving HIV-1 RNA &lt; 50 copies/mL, a rebound in HIV-1 RNA ≥ 50 copies/mL, or a &gt;1 log10 increase in HIV-1 RNA from the nadir which was subsequently confirmed at the following scheduled or unscheduled visit. Suboptimal virologic response was defined as plasma HIV-1 RNA ≥ 200 copies/mL and reduction in HIV-1 RNA ≤ 1 log10 from pre-GS-9131 baseline at the Week 8 visit with confirmation at the next scheduled or unscheduled visit.</description>

          <title>Part 2: Number of Participants With Treatment Emergent Protease Inhibitor (PI) Mutations at the Time of Virologic Failure</title>
          <description>Treatment emergent virological failure was defined as an event with an onset date on or after the study drug start date and no later than 30 days after permanent discontinuation of the study drug. Virologic failure was defined as virologic rebound or as suboptimal virologic response in relation to pre-GS-9131 baseline plasma HIV-1 RNA levels. Virological rebound was defined as if participant at any visit after achieving HIV-1 RNA &lt; 50 copies/mL, a rebound in HIV-1 RNA ≥ 50 copies/mL, or a &gt;1 log10 increase in HIV-1 RNA from the nadir which was subsequently confirmed at the following scheduled or unscheduled visit. Suboptimal virologic response was defined as plasma HIV-1 RNA ≥ 200 copies/mL and reduction in HIV-1 RNA ≤ 1 log10 from pre-GS-9131 baseline at the Week 8 visit with confirmation at the next scheduled or unscheduled visit.</description>
          <population>Due to early study termination, data were not collected as none of the participants qualified for resistance testing after Week 8.</population>
