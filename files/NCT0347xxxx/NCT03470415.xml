  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The heart and vessels are surrounded by layers of adipose tissue, which is a complex organ&#xD;
      composed of adipocytes, stromal cells, macrophages, and a neuronal network, all nourished by&#xD;
      a rich microcirculation. The layers of adipose tissue surrounding the heart can be subdivided&#xD;
      into intra- and extra-pericardial fat. Their thicknesses and volumes can be quantified by&#xD;
      echocardiography and computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging, respectively. The&#xD;
      term extrapericardial fat defines thoracic adipose tissue external to the parietal&#xD;
      pericardium. It originates from primitive thoracic mesenchymal cells and thus derives its&#xD;
      blood supply from noncoronary sources. Intrapericardial fat is further subdivided into&#xD;
      epicardial and pericardial fat. Anatomically, epicardial and pericardial adipose tissues are&#xD;
      clearly different. Epicardial fat is located between the outer wall of the myocardium and the&#xD;
      visceral layer of pericardium.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The epicardial fat layer originates from mesothelial cells and hence obtains its vascular&#xD;
      supply from the coronary arteries. Much of the importance within the epicardial fat is its&#xD;
      anatomical closeness to the myocardium and the fact that the two tissues share the same&#xD;
      microcirculation. Epicardial fat is a metabolically active organ that secrets numerous&#xD;
      bioactive substances, which may alter cardiac function. This small, visceral fat depot had&#xD;
      been accepted as a rich source of free fatty acids and a number of bioactive molecules, such&#xD;
      as adiponectin, resistin and inflammatory cytokines, which could lead to the coronary&#xD;
      endothelial dysfunction. Furthermore, epicardial adipose mass might reflect intra-abdominal&#xD;
      visceral fat. Epicardial adipose tissue is also clinically related to left ventricular mass&#xD;
      and other features of the metabolic syndrome, such as concentrations of LDL cholesterol,&#xD;
      fasting insulin and adiponectin, and arterial blood pressure. Epicardial fat thickness can be&#xD;
      visualized and measured with two-dimensional (2D) echocardiography. Standard parasternal&#xD;
      long-axis and short-axis views from 2D images permit the most accurate measurement of&#xD;
      epicardial fat thickness on the right ventricle, with optimal cursor beam orientation in each&#xD;
      view. Echocardiographically, epicardial fat is generally identified as the relatively&#xD;
      echo-free space between the outer wall of the myocardium and the visceral layer of&#xD;
      pericardium; its thickness is measured perpendicularly on the free wall of the right&#xD;
      ventricle at end-systole in 3 cardiac cycles. Because it is compressed during diastole,&#xD;
      epicardial fat thickness is best measured at end-systole at the point on the free wall of the&#xD;
      right ventricle at which the ultrasound beam is oriented in a perpendicular manner, using the&#xD;
      aortic annulus as an anatomic landmark. Epicardial fat thickness can be also appear as&#xD;
      hyperechoic space, if in large amount (&gt;15 mm). Maximum epicardial fat thickness is measured&#xD;
      from 2D parasternal long axis images at the point on the free wall of the right ventricle&#xD;
      along the midline of the ultrasound beam, perpendicular to the aortic annulus, used as an&#xD;
      anatomic landmark for this view. For midventricular parasternal short-axis assessment,&#xD;
      maximum epicardial fat thickness is measured from 2D images on the right ventricular free&#xD;
      wall along the midline of the ultrasound beam perpendicular to the interventricular septum at&#xD;
      midchordal and tip of the papillary muscle level, as anatomic landmarks. The average value of&#xD;
      3 cardiac cycles from each echocardiographic view is determined. The majority of population&#xD;
      based clinical studies have reported excellent interobserver and intraobserver agreement for&#xD;
      epicardial fat thickness measurement. Echocardiographic epicardial fat measurement may have&#xD;
      some advantages as an index of high cardiometabolic risk. It is a direct measure of visceral&#xD;
      fat rather than an anthropometric measure, such as waist circumference, that includes muscle&#xD;
      and skin layers. The echocardiographic measurement of epicardial fat provides a more&#xD;
      sensitive and specific measure of true visceral fat content, avoiding the possible&#xD;
      confounding effect of increased subcutaneous abdominal fat. It is an objective, noninvasive,&#xD;
      readily available, and certainly less expensive measure of visceral fat than MRI or CT.&#xD;
      Visceral cardiac fat can be quantified fairly precisely compared with ectopic fat deposition&#xD;
      in organs such as the liver, which can be described only qualitatively unless expensive&#xD;
      measurements are made, such as CT or MRI. Echocardiographic epicardial fat is a direct&#xD;
      measure of ectopic fat deposition, whereas anthropometric measures can be associated only&#xD;
      with ectopic fat deposition. It can be measured even from echocardiograms that were not&#xD;
      specifically performed to optimize the measurement of epicardial fat. It can be quantified&#xD;
      with other echocardiographic parameters, such left ventricular mass and ejection fraction,&#xD;
      traditionally associated with cardiovascular risk. Echocardiographic epicardial fat could be&#xD;
      a more reliable quantitative therapeutic marker during interventions modulating and reducing&#xD;
      visceral adiposity. Diabetic nephropathy or diabetic kidney disease is a syndrome&#xD;
      characterized by the presence of pathological quantities of urine albumin excretion, diabetic&#xD;
      glomerular lesions, and loss of glomerular filtration rate (GFR) in diabetics. Incipient&#xD;
      nephropathy is the initial presence of low but abnormal amounts of urine albumin, referred to&#xD;
      as microalbuminuria (persistent albuminuria at level 30-299 mg/24 hours), while overt&#xD;
      nephropathy or macroalbuminuria (persistent albuminuria at level 300 mg/24 hours).&#xD;
