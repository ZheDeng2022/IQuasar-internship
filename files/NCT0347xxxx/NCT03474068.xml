  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Back pain is experienced by approximately 80% of the population during their life. However,&#xD;
      only a small minority (&lt;1%) will have a medical condition (such as Cauda Equina Syndrome)&#xD;
      which requires immediate medical intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently, it is not known how many people access Emergency Medical Services (EMS) in an&#xD;
      attempt to meet their needs for their back pain. The demand on EMS is increasing and many of&#xD;
      these patients could be better managed by other services. Additionally, little is known about&#xD;
      the characteristics of those accessing EMS due to back pain, or the nature of the contacts&#xD;
      regarding issues such as outcome of the patient contact. The aims of this study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. to quantify the prevalence of people contacting EMS via telephone with non-traumatic&#xD;
           back pain&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. to describe the characteristics of people calling EMS with non-traumatic back pain&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. to describe key characteristics of the contact between the service user and EMS&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. to compare the call prevalence, patient characteristics and contact characteristics&#xD;
           between people with non-traumatic back pain and a group of people for whom EMS contact&#xD;
           is recommended as standard, in this case people presenting with cerebrovascular accident&#xD;
           (CVA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A secondary aim of the work is to explore what factors might predict patient outcomes such as&#xD;
      whether the patient is transported to A/E, whether the patient receives analgesics, and&#xD;
      whether the patient is admitted to hospital.&#xD;

      Purpose and Design&#xD;
&#xD;
      Back Pain is a common cause of chronic pain and disability. National Institute for Health and&#xD;
      Clinical Excellence (NICE, 2016) identify it as affecting 1 in 10 people and causing more&#xD;
      disability than any other condition. Whilst in most people it resolves without any healthcare&#xD;
      input in can be distressing and debilitating. For those whose pain has not improved with&#xD;
      non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) combined physical and psychological treatments&#xD;
      are recommended. These are provided by specialist services and are not available in Emergency&#xD;
      Departments or via Ambulance Services (collectively referred to as Emergency Medical&#xD;
      Services) however anecdotally many people with back pain self-refer to these services. The&#xD;
      prevalence of people self-referring and their characteristics are currently unknown as these&#xD;
      figures are not routinely reported although the information exists within the data collected&#xD;
      by ambulance services.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aims to analyse anonymised data from the North East Ambulance Service NHS Trust&#xD;
      (NEAS) to establish the prevalence of those calling with back pain. The characteristics of&#xD;
      people presenting to the North East Ambulance Service (NEAS) over a 12-month period with back&#xD;
      pain will be described and compared to a comparison group (people presenting with&#xD;
      cardiovascular accident (CVA)) to identify statistically significant characteristics. The&#xD;
      comparison group of CVA was chosen as this group is well defined, cannot be definitively&#xD;
      treated in the community and require rapid transfer to in-patient care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These characteristics may help target information and inform service design to meet those&#xD;
      people with back pain not accessing specialist services that are more appropriate for their&#xD;
      condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will request anonymised data from NEAS. The data will cover all people who have&#xD;
      accessed their services in a 12-month period who were recorded as having: an initial&#xD;
      presentation of back pain; a clinical impression of back pain; initial presentation of CVA;&#xD;
      or clinical impression of CVA. The information include data related to the call or&#xD;
      attendance, patient demographics, geographical location and clinical data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will be analysed to establish descriptive statistics related to patients calling with&#xD;
      back pain and comparing these to those with CVA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment&#xD;
&#xD;
      The data being used for this study is from a currently existing NEAS database and therefore&#xD;
      there will be no recruitment of participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion/exclusion All patients over the age of 16 will be included. Those aged under 16&#xD;
      will be excluded as they are not included in clinical guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All incidents that receive an initial coding or clinical impression of back pain or&#xD;
      cerebrovascular accident will be included.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Risks, Burdens and Benefits&#xD;
&#xD;
      The data has been collected for clinical care and not for research purposes. Therefore&#xD;
      patients will not have explicitly consented for their information to be used for research.&#xD;
      The Information Governance Officer at NEAS has confirmed that the data will be in&#xD;
      non-personally identifiable when it is released to the research team and is compliant with&#xD;
      Section 33 of the Data Protection Act 1998.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main risk to patients is that their clinical data is being used for research purposes.&#xD;
      However identifiable data will only be available to the usual clinical team. Anonymised&#xD;
      information will be extracted by a NEAS member of staff before it is securely transferred to&#xD;
      the team at Teesside University where it will be analysed. Names and addresses will be&#xD;
      completely removed from the database before it leaves the NHS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Some publications require raw data to be supplied. This would be supplied but it will be a&#xD;
      non-personally identifiable dataset.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Confidentiality&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Caldicott Principles will be followed:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Justify the purpose(s) of obtaining the information&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Don't use person-identifiable information unless it is absolutely necessary&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Use the minimum necessary person-identifiable information&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Access to person-identifiable information should be on a strict need-to-know basis&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Everyone with access to person-identifiable information should be aware of their&#xD;
           responsibilities&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Understand and comply with the law&#xD;
&#xD;
      Problems arising from the processing of identifiable data and how they will be handled&#xD;
&#xD;
      Individual's data may be held in more than one system depending on their specific pathway of&#xD;
      care and the best way to link these records is via the incident number. Before releasing the&#xD;
      data NEAS will apply a mathematical function to all incident numbers, this will ensure they&#xD;
      no longer be linked to individuals but records with the same incident number will still be&#xD;
      linked. The nature of this function will be retained by NEAS and not disclosed to the&#xD;
      research team.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The database contains socioeconomic data in the form of patients' postcodes. This&#xD;
      socioeconomic data is important as it has been linked to ambulance service use. A postcode is&#xD;
      identifiable data. To overcome this NEAS will supply only the first four digits which covers&#xD;
      a sufficiently large geographical area that this will no longer be identifiable data. The&#xD;
      first four digits will be sufficient to identify a Lower Layer Super Output Area code (LSOA&#xD;
      code) which is the equivalent index of socioeconomic status.&#xD;
