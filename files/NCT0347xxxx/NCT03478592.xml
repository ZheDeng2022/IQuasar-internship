    <textblock>
      The meta-analysis comparing the cryopreservation of human embryos by vitrification or&#xD;
      slow-freezing suggested that more well design studies as randomized trials are necessary to&#xD;
      identify the most successful method for cryopreservation. The efficacy of the vitrification&#xD;
      with the GAVI system will be compared with the conventional slow freezing method through a&#xD;
      randomized control trial. Couples in IVF attempt will be randomized at the day of embryo&#xD;
      cryopreservation by the biologist. Supernumerary frozen embryos will be thawed and&#xD;
      transferred in utero in case of failure of the &quot;fresh&quot; embryo transfer. The outcomes of the&#xD;
      thawing and frozen/thawed embryo transfer will be assessed. In the two groups, the patients&#xD;
      will benefit of the standard IVF procedures applied in the Assisted Reproductive Technologies&#xD;
      (ART) center of Toulouse.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The last decade has seen a development of a new cryopreservation technique called&#xD;
      vitrification. Despite a lack of randomized control trials comparing slow-freezing and&#xD;
      vitrification, vitrification seems to show better recovery rates and pregnancy outcomes.&#xD;
      However vitrification is a manual, labour-intensive and highly skilled procedure, results can&#xD;
      vary between embryologists and clinics. The GAVI system, an automation instrument with a&#xD;
      novel closed system device has been developed. The present study would like to assess the&#xD;
      outcomes for embryos automatically vitrification processed with the GAVI system compared with&#xD;
      those processed with conventional reference technique of slow freezing.&#xD;
