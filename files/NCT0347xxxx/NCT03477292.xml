      There is evidence that using shorter antibiotic regimens may help in decreasing antimicrobial&#xD;
      resistance and reducing drug-related adverse events.6 Moreover, short-course treatments were&#xD;
      found to be as effective as longer-course antibiotic treatment.7,8 In a pooled analysis of&#xD;
      four randomized trials in VAP comparing shorter versus long duration of antibiotics in the&#xD;
      management of VAP, no difference in the mortality was found. We hypothesize that the use of&#xD;
      short course of antibiotics in the treatment of VAP due to drug resistant Acinetobacter&#xD;
      baumanii (sensitive to carbapenems and/or colistin only) may result in a higher&#xD;
      antibiotic-free days and drug related adverse events, in comparison to a longer duration of&#xD;
      antibiotics. In this study, we propose to study a 7-day versus 14-day course of antibiotics&#xD;
      in patients with drug-resistant Acinetobacter baumanii.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) is one of the major causes of morbidity and mortality&#xD;
      in the ICU, accounting for 25% of the total infections occurring in this setting and 50% of&#xD;
      all antibiotic prescriptions in patients who are mechanically ventilated.1,2 The incidence of&#xD;
      VAP depends not only on the type of the institution, the preventive measures and therapeutic&#xD;
      approaches that are used, but also on the type of surveillance systems by which incidence is&#xD;
      estimated. There are reports of incidence across different settings varying from 1.4 up to&#xD;
      42.8 episodes of VAP/1,000 ventilation-days.2 Patients with VAP have significantly longer ICU&#xD;
      and hospital lengths of stay compared with similar patients without VAP.3,4 Consequently, the&#xD;
      economic burden of VAP is considerable, leading to significant draining of resources. Even&#xD;
      after adjusting for underlying severity of illness, the attributable cost of VAP amounts to&#xD;
      several thousands of US dollars per patient.5 There is evidence that using shorter antibiotic&#xD;
      regimens may help in decreasing antimicrobial resistance and reducing drug-related adverse&#xD;
      events.6 Moreover, short-course treatments were found to be as effective as longer-course&#xD;
      antibiotic treatment.7,8 In a pooled analysis of four randomized trials in VAP comparing&#xD;
      shorter versus long duration of antibiotics in the management of VAP, no difference in the&#xD;
      mortality was found.9 There was an increase in the antibiotic free days in the short course&#xD;
      antibiotic arm. There was no difference in the number of relapses of VAP with either modality&#xD;
      of treatment.9 In another analysis of six studies with 1088 subjects, there was a higher&#xD;
      occurrence of relapses of VAP due to non-lactose fermenting gram negative organism.10&#xD;
      However, there was no difference in the mortality rates.10 The problem with both these&#xD;
      meta-analyses was that they did not provide information regarding the outcomes of VAP due to&#xD;
      Acinetobacter baumanii.9,10 Also, the short duration strategy included studies that&#xD;
      randomized patients to seven to eight days and ten-to fifteen days in the long duration&#xD;
      strategy. None of the previous studies has provided information about outcomes of VAP due to&#xD;
      Acinetobacter baumanii. In our observation, most of the episodes of VAP in our ICU are due to&#xD;
      drug resistant Acinetobacter baumanii. We hypothesize that the use of short course of&#xD;
      antibiotics in the treatment of VAP due to drug resistant Acinetobacter baumanii (sensitive&#xD;
      to carbapenems and/or colistin only) may result in a higher antibiotic-free days and drug&#xD;
      related adverse events, in comparison to a longer duration of antibiotics. In this study, we&#xD;
      propose to study a 7-day versus 14-day course of antibiotics in patients with drug-resistant&#xD;
      Acinetobacter baumanii.&#xD;
