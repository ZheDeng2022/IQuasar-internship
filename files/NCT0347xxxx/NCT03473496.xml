      Multiple myeloma（MM） is one of the most common malignant diseases in the blood system.There&#xD;
      is still no cure for the disease which only control the development of the disease in various&#xD;
      ways.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In recent years, the understanding of pathogenic molecular mechanism in MM , many new types&#xD;
      of drugs can be used in the treatment of this disease, one of the most widely used is&#xD;
      proteasome inhibitors and immune regulator.Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation has also&#xD;
      been shown to improve complete remission rates and prolong patient survival.Combined with the&#xD;
      advantages of multiple therapies, chimeric antigen receptor T cells (CAR-T) have gradually&#xD;
      become one of the strongest and most powerful weapons against multiple myeloma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CAR - T cells was taken in the form of genetic modification, and specific identified target&#xD;
      antigen monoclonal antibody of single variable region (scFv) expression in T cell surface,&#xD;
      and coupled with the activation of intracellular proliferation signal domain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When scFv recognizes antigens expressed in malignant cells, it stimulates the activation&#xD;
      signal of downstream T cells and produces specific killing effects. CAR-T therapy is one of&#xD;
      revolutionary targeted immunotherapy.The efficacy of CAR-T cells for the treatment of acute B&#xD;
      lymphocytic leukemia has been widely recognized, and several clinical trials have been&#xD;
      reported in the treatment of multiple myeloma with CAR-T cells.Throughout registration of&#xD;
      clinical trials and published research results, B-cell maturation antigen (BCMA) as one of&#xD;
      targets , its effect is more significant than other molecules.As with BCMA antigens, cluster&#xD;
      of differentiation 138(CD138), cluster of differentiation 56 (CD56) or cluster of&#xD;
      differentiation 38(CD38) antigens are also highly expressed in multiple myeloma cells.With&#xD;
      CD138 as the target for the treatment of CAR-T cells, several clinical studies have been&#xD;
      registered, and the results show that some of them are effective.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to lay a foundation for the application of relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma&#xD;
      patients with CAR-T therapy，objects are refractory/ relapsed patients with multiple&#xD;
      myeloma,and plans to into the group of the number of cases in 50 cases.The main content is&#xD;
      safety, efficacy and feasibility analysis of the CAR-T cells （single CAR-T or double CAR-T&#xD;
      cells with BCMA、CD138、CD56 or CD38 ) in the treatment of refractory/relapsed multiple&#xD;
      myeloma.&#xD;
