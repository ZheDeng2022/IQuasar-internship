      Carpal tunnel syndrome occurs when a nerve gets pinched as it passes through a confined&#xD;
      tunnel within the wrist and hand. It is the most commonly pinched nerve and often results in&#xD;
      disabling hand numbness, tingling, pain and weakness. For moderate and severe cases, an&#xD;
      operation is often performed that cuts the ligament that presses on the nerve. This surgery&#xD;
      is generally very successful but involves a 2-5 cm long incision at the base of the palm.&#xD;
      Recovery from the surgery usually takes 3-8 weeks. Ultrasound provides a clear noninvasive&#xD;
      way of looking at the contents of the carpal tunnel. A technique has been developed whereby a&#xD;
      wire thread is looped around the ligament using a needle guided by ultrasound. The ligament&#xD;
      is cut by the wire below the surface of the skin. This technique results in 2 needle puncture&#xD;
      holes instead of the open incision of the traditional surgery. The investigators have&#xD;
      completed research on this technique in cadavers. It was confirmed that complete or almost&#xD;
      complete cutting of the ligament can be safely and predictably accomplished. This research&#xD;
      will look at the effectiveness of this looped thread technique of carpal tunnel release on&#xD;
      patients who have carpal tunnel syndrome. Specifically, participants will be required to: 1.&#xD;
      rate the severity of their carpal tunnel syndrome symptoms and disability using a standard&#xD;
      questionnaire, 2. measure hand sensation, 3. measure pinch and grip strength tests of their&#xD;
      hands, 4. undergo ultrasound measurements of the size of the pinched nerve at the carpal&#xD;
      tunnel, and 5. undergo electrical tests to measure the nerves ability to conduct impulses&#xD;
      across the carpal tunnel. These will be measured before the looped wire procedure and at 3&#xD;
      and 6 months following the procedure. Recovery time will also be measured.&#xD;

      Objectives: to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of a minimally invasive&#xD;
      ultrasound-guided looped thread technique of carpal tunnel release&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background: Carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) is the most common peripheral entrapment neuropathy,&#xD;
      having a prevalence of 3.7%. CTS is the 2nd leading worktime loss condition. Open surgical&#xD;
      decompression of the carpal tunnel is an evidence-based and commonly performed treatment for&#xD;
      moderate to severe cases, predictably providing long-term symptom relief. This surgical&#xD;
      technique involves placing a 2-5 cm long longitudinal incision at the palm, incising the&#xD;
      skin, subcutaneous tissue, palmar fascia, palmaris longus tendon (if present) and transverse&#xD;
      carpal ligament under direct visualization. After 3-8 weeks of recovery, most patients&#xD;
      experience excellent relief of symptoms and improvement in hand function. On occasion, the&#xD;
      procedure is complicated by nerve damage, scar or pillar pain. A variety of strategies have&#xD;
      been devised to minimize the invasive nature of carpal tunnel release in hopes to reduce post&#xD;
      procedure pain, weakness and recovery time. In the late 1980s, an endoscopic release&#xD;
      technique was devised. A recent meta-analysis of existing randomized control trials comparing&#xD;
      open to endoscopic release found endoscopic release to provide better early recovery of grip&#xD;
      and pinch strength, less scar tenderness and earlier returned to work (~9 days). There was a&#xD;
      similar risk of pillar pain and reoperation, and a higher risk of nerve injury (mostly&#xD;
      transient neurapraxia). The development of high-resolution ultrasound scanning allows&#xD;
      detailed visualization of the carpal tunnel and its contents. Hydrodissection, the injection&#xD;
      of fluid during ultrasound visualization, adds to image clarity of both the contents of the&#xD;
      carpal tunnel as well as the location of operative instruments. A few minimally invasive&#xD;
      ultrasound-guided percutaneous carpal tunnel release techniques have been described. The&#xD;
      cutting instruments have included needle tip, knife, saws blades, and thread. Initial results&#xD;
      of these techniques suggest that they are feasible, safe, effective and are associated with&#xD;
      short recovery times. The most recently described minimally invasive technique involves&#xD;
      percutaneously looping a cutting thread around the transverse carpal ligament using a needle&#xD;
      under ultrasound guidance. By reciprocally sliding the 2 ends of the thread back and forth&#xD;
      like a Gigli saw, the transverse carpal ligament is transected. Only 2 needle puncture site&#xD;
      are required. The looped thread carpal tunnel release (TCTR) procedure was initially&#xD;
      performed on a single cadaveric hand and dissection demonstrated complete transection of the&#xD;
      transverse carpal ligament and no injury to other structures. The authors then performed the&#xD;
      same procedure on 34 hands of 20 patients. The primary outcome measure was the Levine-Katz&#xD;
      questionnaire completed 3 months postprocedure. The questionnaire scores were compared to&#xD;
      those reported in the literature for open and endoscopic release techniques and were found to&#xD;
      be similar. No post TCTR complications were reported. Our research group has recently&#xD;
      completed a cadaveric evaluation of this technique and found that ultrasound accurately&#xD;
      defines the critical boundries and contents of the carpal tunnel in all cases, complete or&#xD;
      near-complete transection of the transverse carpal ligament was achieved and no trauma was&#xD;
      sustained by any structure within the carpal tunnel other than the transverse carpal&#xD;
      ligament.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedure/Methods: subjects with clinical and electrophysiologically confirmed CTS from the&#xD;
      practice of the principal investigator will be invited to participate. The 1st phase of this&#xD;
      study will involve TCTR of 5 carpal tunnels. Within a month prior to and at 3 and 6 months&#xD;
      post procedure the following outcome measures will be collected: subjective measure of&#xD;
      symptom and functional limitation severity (Boston Carpal Tunnel Questionnaire); monofilament&#xD;
      hand sensibility testing, grip and pinch strength; median nerve cross-sectional area&#xD;
      measurement at the carpal tunnel inlet using ultrasound; and electrophysiologic function of&#xD;
      the median nerve across the carpal tunnel (motor and sensory conduction velocities and&#xD;
      amplitudes). At weekly intervals for the 1st month, each subject will also be contacted to&#xD;
      report on their recovery (return to everyday activities including work) and any adverse&#xD;
      effects/complications. The Boston Carpal Tunnel Questionnaire will also be completed at 1&#xD;
      month post TCTR. Assuming no serious complications are encountered from the initial 5&#xD;
      procedures, and upon approval from the supervising Data and Safety Monitoring Board, 15&#xD;
      additional carpal tunnels will undergo TCTR and the same outcome measures will be recorded.&#xD;
      The outcome data will be analyzed using a repeated measures Analysis of Variance (Boston&#xD;
      Carpal Tunnel Questionnaire; monofilament hand sensibility;grip and pinch strength; median&#xD;
      nerve cross-sectional area; median nerve motor and sensory conduction velocities and&#xD;
      amplitudes) and descriptive statistics (recovery duration and adverse effects/complications).&#xD;
