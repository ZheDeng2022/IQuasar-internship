      The objective is the development and validation of morphological markers informative of&#xD;
      aortic dilatation in order to improve the precision of the risk of aneurysm of the thoracic&#xD;
      aorta and of acute aortic syndrome for patients with bicuspid aortic valve (BAV).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of this study is to demonstrate a correlation between the aortic local&#xD;
      pulse wave velocity (PWV) measured with MRI and the progression of the thoracic aorta&#xD;
      diameters measured by MRI after a follow-up of 2 years.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Background Bicuspid Aortic Valve (BAV) is the most common congenital heart defect with&#xD;
      prevalence around 1 to 2% of the general population . It is defined by the presence of two&#xD;
      functional cusps with less than three parallel zones of apposition between the cusps. This&#xD;
      different valve's morphology is associated with a spectrum of valvular (aortic stenosis and&#xD;
      insufficiency) and aortic complications (aneurysm and dissection). Indeed, the valvular&#xD;
      abnormality is associated with changes in the aortic arch with an increase in the incidence&#xD;
      of ascending aortic aneurysm unrelated to valvular functional impairment. The mechanisms&#xD;
      responsible for aortic involvement are still incompletely understood but combine, in varying&#xD;
      proportions, a constitutional fragility (linked to a common embryological origin of the&#xD;
      aortic valve and the aortic arch) and to the haemodynamic modifications, generated by the&#xD;
      specific morphology of BAV .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Current risk prediction of aneurysm development is currently performed only with the&#xD;
      ascending aortic diameter, associated with history of aortic coarctation and familial history&#xD;
      of dissection. Moreover, aortic dilatation may occur after aortic valve replacement alone,&#xD;
      necessitating a second intervention, with a higher surgical risk. Improvement of the&#xD;
      aortopathy evaluation is therefore a major stake in the evaluation of the BAV patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Studies of the biomechanical properties of the BAV aortic wall converge towards an increase&#xD;
      in arterial stiffness as well as in other elastopathies such as Marfan's disease. Thus,&#xD;
      measurements of aortic distensibility in trans-thoracic echocardiography (TTE) or MRI, or the&#xD;
      measurement of the Pulse Wave Velocity (PWV) are significantly different case of BAV compared&#xD;
      to the general population. However, no prospective study has demonstrated the prognostic role&#xD;
      of these morphological biomarkers in the prediction of aortic dilation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      From a biomechanical point of view, the vessel's rupture appears when the mechanical stress&#xD;
      applied to the wall exceeds the material resistance properties. The aortic resistance&#xD;
      evaluation requires the use of different imaging modalities which propose the measurement of&#xD;
      stiffness parameters. Circumferential stiffness (with TTE or MRI) can be evaluated by&#xD;
      measuring the distensibility. In addition, longitudinal stiffness can be evaluated by&#xD;
      measuring the local PWV.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We aim at better defining the vascular involvement of BAV patients by determining the&#xD;
      prognostic role of functional parameters as non-invasive predictive factors for aortic&#xD;
      dilation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      1.Main hypothesis The main hypothesis is that the progression of aortic dilation is dependent&#xD;
      on the longitudinal and circumferential aortic stiffness in case of BAV.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will therefore try to demonstrate a correlation between the local PWV&#xD;
      measurements in MRI, combined with a simultaneous measurement of the non-invasive central&#xD;
      pressure (SphygmoCor XCEL®, Atcor Medical ©), with the segmental aortic size progression. The&#xD;
      investigators hope to define new biomarkers aortic dilation prediction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      1.Secondary hypothesis&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The measurement of the local PWV of the common carotid artery, measured with UF, is&#xD;
           correlated with the progression of the aortic dilation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The measurement of aortic distensibility at the Valsalva sinus and ascending tubular&#xD;
           aortic levels, measured in TTE or MRI, correlates with the progression of aortic&#xD;
           dilation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Originality and innovative aspects - Prospective evaluation of the different aortic segments&#xD;
      dilatation in case of BAV: Few studies have prospectively evaluated the aortic dilation&#xD;
      progression in BAV. There are currently no prognostic markers of dilatation validated in this&#xD;
      group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Use of aortic MRI combined with central pressure measurement as a prognostic evaluation&#xD;
      tool for aortopathy associated with BAV: Following the development of 4D MRI in&#xD;
      cardiovascular imaging, evaluation of the aorta is possible by studying both the wall's&#xD;
      movements during the cardiac cycle and the wall shear stress evaluation. This makes possible&#xD;
      to obtain, at each part of the thoracic aorta, measures of circumferential distensibility,&#xD;
      local PWV, and shear stress.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Coupling these two imaging modalities is particularly interesting in the aortic evaluation of&#xD;
      BAV due to the involvement of the flow changes in aortic stiffness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Use of the common carotid artery stiffness as a prognostic evaluation tool for aortopathy&#xD;
      associated with BAV independently of the aortic diameter Due to the common embryological&#xD;
      origin of aorta and the common carotid arteries, aortopathy associated with BAV is associated&#xD;
      with an increase in of the common carotid arteries stiffness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The evaluation of the carotid artery will therefore help to evaluate the correlation between&#xD;
      carotid rigidity and progression of aortic dilation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Evaluation of the local PWV as carotid stiffness biomarker Ultrasound analysis will also be&#xD;
      innovative, with the use of a fine ultrasonic method with very high frame rate (more than&#xD;
      10,000 images per second) developed by the Langevin Institute (Mathias Fink, Michael Tanter&#xD;
      and Mathieu Pernot). The collaboration between the Langevin Institute and the H.E.G. lead to&#xD;
      numerous publications both in the vascular and cardiac levels. The vascular medicine&#xD;
      department has an Aixplorer® prototype with vascular and cardiac applications on site. The&#xD;
      advantage of this technology is its ultrafastecho mode with very high temporal resolution&#xD;
      which allows the vascular level to visualize and to calculate the speed of the arterial pulse&#xD;
      wave which is correlated to the local rigidity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The use of this innovative technique in aortic bicuspid will hopefully validate the&#xD;
      evaluation of the carotid velocity of the pulse wave as an easily accessible prognostic&#xD;
      marker of aortic dilation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Purpose of the research&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective is the development and validation of morphological markers informative of&#xD;
      aortic dilatation in order to improve the precision of the risk of aneurysm of the thoracic&#xD;
      aorta and of acute aortic syndrome for patients with BAV.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of this study is to demonstrate a correlation between the aortic local&#xD;
      PWV measured with MRI and the progression of the thoracic aorta diameters measured by MRI&#xD;
      after a follow-up of 2 years&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objectives are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To demonstrate a correlation between the progression of the dilatation of the different&#xD;
           segments of the thoracic aorta with the following measures:&#xD;

                tubular aortic level.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Aortic distensibility measured in TTE of the same segments in TM and in B mode .&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Carotid pulse rate measured on carotid arteries by UF.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To demonstrate a correlation between the progression of the dilatation of the different&#xD;
           segments of the thoracic aorta with the following environmental risk factors:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Active Smoking&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Diabetes&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Hypertension&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Familial form of aortic BAV (defined by the presence of a relative, 1st or 2nd&#xD;
                degree, with BAV or thoracic aortic aneurysm)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Morphological type of BAV&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Aortic coarctation&#xD;
