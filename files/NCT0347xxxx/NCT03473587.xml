      This trial will compare the effects of a culturally targeted intervention designed to assist&#xD;
      participants to identify and overcome individual barriers to colorectal cancer (CRC) and to&#xD;
      promote CRC screenings using motivational interviewing (Ml) delivered by a lay health advisor&#xD;
      (LHA) compared to the current standard-of-care (distribution of a brochure describing CRC&#xD;
      screening services offered by the hospital) on CRC screening compliance.&#xD;

      The specific aim of this project is to adapt and pilot a tailored intervention to promote CRC&#xD;
      screenings in a rural Appalachian Kentucky emergency department (ED) in order to: (a)&#xD;
      evaluate the feasibility of providing a cancer screening promotion intervention in an&#xD;
      emergency department (ED) that serves a rural Appalachian community; and (b) assess the&#xD;
      effects of the intervention on barriers to CRC screening, stage of readiness to screen and&#xD;
      CRC screening engagement. The first phase of the project will involve the adaptation and&#xD;
      pretesting of the intervention. This phase will take approximately 6 months. The second phase&#xD;
      of the project will involve piloting the intervention and evaluating its efficacy and&#xD;
      feasibility and will take place over the following 18 months. We will conduct a randomized&#xD;
      controlled trial to examine the efficacy and feasibility of delivering the LHA delivered MI&#xD;
      intervention to promote CRC screening in persons waiting in a rural Appalachian emergency&#xD;
      department (ED) for non urgent complaints. We will evaluate efficacy by measurement of CRC&#xD;
      screening status at baseline and three and six months post intervention.&#xD;
