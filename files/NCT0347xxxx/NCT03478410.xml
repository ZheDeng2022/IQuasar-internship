  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Exosome plays an important role in the pathophysiology of the cardiovascular system. Since&#xD;
      the field of cardiovascular exosome is still in its infancy, there are no available data&#xD;
      regarding to its role in cardiac arrhythmias. The current study investigates the role of&#xD;
      epicardial fat derived exosomes in patients who suffer from atrial fibrillation.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Myocardial cells communication is mediated via direct cell to cell contact, cell to matrix&#xD;
      interaction, long-range signals, electrical signals, and via extracellular chemical molecules&#xD;
      (such as proteins, nucleotides, lipids and short peptides). Cell to cell communication can be&#xD;
      achieved through direct contact (i.e. Gap junction, cell surface protein/protein interaction)&#xD;
      or via secreted signaling molecules (i.e. hormones, neurotransmitters, cytokines). In the&#xD;
      last few decades, a third intercellular communication mechanism has gained intense attention&#xD;
      - extracellular vesicles that include: (1) apoptotic vesicles (1000-4000 nm), (2)&#xD;
      microvesicles (100 nm - 1000 nm), and the smallest extracellular vesicles (3) exosomes&#xD;
      (40-100 nm).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The exosomes are produced through the endosomal pathway and are able to carry cargo and&#xD;
      transfer them to recipient cells, thus contributing to cell-to-cell communication. The&#xD;
      exosomes cargo includes protein content, rRNA, tRNA, short DNA sequences, messenger RNA&#xD;
      (mRNA) and microRNA (miRNA). The last two can change the gene expression within the target&#xD;
      cells and by that affect myocardial cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nowadays, it is known that in the cardiovascular system, exosome plays important roles in the&#xD;
      pathophysiology of myocardial infarction (MI) and as an indicator for the damage and repair&#xD;
      mechanisms post-acute MI (i.e. miR-126), in myocardial remodeling, and cardiac regeneration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since the field of cardiovascular exosome is still in its infancy, there are no available&#xD;
      data regarding to its role in cardiac arrhythmias. Therefore, there is place to investigate&#xD;
      the role of exosomes in patients who suffer from atrial fibrillation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Some of the important issues to explore are: (1) Do the epicardial fat in patients with&#xD;
      atrial fibrillation release quantitatively and qualitatively different exosomes than in&#xD;
      patients without atrial fibrillation? (2) Can epicardial fat exosomes be a clinical biomarker&#xD;
      for arrhythmias? (3) Can these exosomes be a target for the treatment and prevention of&#xD;
      arrhythmias?&#xD;
&#xD;
      The current study will include patients who undergo any cardiac surgery and will give&#xD;
      informed consent. An epicardial fat biopsy will be taken and cultured in a medium that&#xD;
      contain M-199 medium, dexamethasone, gentamicin, and insulin for 9 days. The exosomes will be&#xD;
      collected from the medium and analyzed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participants will be divided into two groups: (1) participants with atrial fibrillation,&#xD;
      (2) participants who did not develop ever atrial fibrillation.&#xD;
