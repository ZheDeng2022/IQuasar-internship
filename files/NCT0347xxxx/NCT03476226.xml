  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether patients experience a better quality of&#xD;
      life when they have received education about coping strategies for cognitive dysfunction.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cancer treatment may consist of chemotherapy, radiation, hormone therapy, surgery or a&#xD;
      combination of all disciplines. However, breast cancer therapies have at times demonstrated&#xD;
      distressing effects in patients/survivors during and/or following treatment. One area that is&#xD;
      found to cause distress for the breast cancer patient is changes in cognitive function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Areas most commonly impacted by changes in cognitive function as a result of chemotherapy&#xD;
      include executive functioning (including judgment, hindsight and foresight), processing speed&#xD;
      or reaction time, working memory, and organizational skills.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Due to the limited amount of research involving quality of life as related to cognitive&#xD;
      dysfunction, there is a clear need for additional investigation. Treatment typically focuses&#xD;
      on the physical and psychosocial aspects of patients/survivors, however emphasis should also&#xD;
      be placed on the impact of quality of life during treatment and survivorship due to the&#xD;
      potential for far-reaching effects as previously discussed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Oncology nurses may be instrumental in identifying patients with Cognitive Dysfunction. In&#xD;
      doing so, the nurse may then communicate with the patient/survivor as to the impact of&#xD;
      Cognitive Dysfunction on quality of life. The nurse can provide appropriate education and or&#xD;
      additional support options.&#xD;
