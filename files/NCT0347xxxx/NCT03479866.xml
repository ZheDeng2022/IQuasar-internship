  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The foods we eat - our diet - can affect whether we develop diseases during our lives, such&#xD;
      as diabetes or heart disease. This is because the amount and types of foods we eat can affect&#xD;
      our weight, and because different foods are metabolised (processed) by the body in different&#xD;
      ways.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Scientists have also found that the bacteria in our guts (the gut microbiome) affects our&#xD;
      metabolism, weight and health and that, together with a person's diet and metabolism, could&#xD;
      be used to predict appetite and how meals affect levels of sugar (glucose) and fats (lipids)&#xD;
      found in blood after eating. If blood sugar and fat are too high too often, there's a greater&#xD;
      chance of developing diseases such as diabetes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The gut microbiome is different in different people. Only 10-20% of the types of bacteria&#xD;
      found in our guts are found in everyone. This might mean that the best diet to prevent&#xD;
      disease needs matching to a person's gut microbiome and it might be possible to find&#xD;
      personalised foods or diets that will help reduce the chance of developing chronic disease as&#xD;
      well as metabolic syndrome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study investigators are recruiting volunteers aged 18 years or over from the TwinsUK&#xD;
      cohort to take part in a study that aims to answer the questions above. The participants will&#xD;
      need to come in for a clinical visit where they will give blood, stool, saliva and urine&#xD;
      samples. The participants will also be given a standardised breakfast and lunch and fitted&#xD;
      with a glucose monitor (Abbott Freestyle Libre-CE marked) to monitor their blood sugar&#xD;
      levels. After the visit, the participants will be asked to eat standardised meals at home for&#xD;
      breakfast for a further 12 days. Participants will also be required to prick their fingers at&#xD;
      regular intervals to collect small amounts of blood, and to record constantly their appetite,&#xD;
      food, physical activity and sleep using apps and wearable devices.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Choice of design: The study is a single arm mechanistic intervention study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population: Twin participants will be recruited from the TwinsUK database and non-twins&#xD;
      will be recruited via social media platforms and advertising campaigns.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening Assessment: Prospective participants will be selected based on the defined&#xD;
      inclusion and exclusion criteria by the study management team. Recruitment will be done over&#xD;
      the phone and via the Internet and emails and prospective participants will be booked in for&#xD;
      their initial appointment to acquire baseline measurements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study duration: Each participant will take part in the study for a period of up to 3 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The PREDICT study will be divided into 3 protocol cohorts, where all participants (n=2,500)&#xD;
      complete a baseline clinical visit as described below. Of this total, Cohort 1 (n=1,150) will&#xD;
      complete a home-based dietary intervention lasting up to 2 weeks (June 2018 - May 2019).&#xD;
      Within this group, 100 participants will complete an additional home-based dietary&#xD;
      intervention lasting up to 3 weeks (February 2019 - May 2019).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following completion of this first cohort, Cohort 2 (n=900) will complete a similar&#xD;
      home-based dietary intervention lasting up to 2 weeks (June 2019 - May 2023). Within this&#xD;
      cohort, 50 participants will also complete deep cardiometabolic phenotyping at their clinical&#xD;
      visit (September 2019 - February 2020).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Finally, Cohort 3 (n=450) will only complete the baseline clinical visit (June 2019 - May&#xD;
      2023).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dietary intervention:&#xD;
&#xD;
      On day one (baseline visit) participants will be given standardised meals for breakfast and&#xD;
      lunch. Participants continuing onto the home-based intervention (n=2,050) will receive a&#xD;
      dietary intervention lasting up to 12 days following their clinical visit. Each participant&#xD;
      will be instructed to eat standardised meals for breakfast, which must be their first meal of&#xD;
      the day. On some of these days the participants will also be asked to eat a standardised&#xD;
      lunch meal. Participants are free to eat whatever they wish at all other times, although we&#xD;
      may provide a list of recommended foods. The standardised meals will be provided to all&#xD;
      participants by the study team on the day of the visit. The foods included as part of these&#xD;
      meals will be foods that are commonly consumed and can be made from products sold in UK&#xD;
      supermarkets. Participants will be reassured that the amount of food will be designed to&#xD;
      ensure a stable body weight over the course of the study. Participants will be asked to&#xD;
      consume the entire amount of food indicated for the standardised meals and to record any&#xD;
      left-over food via a digital app for which training will be provided at the start of the&#xD;
      study. For the remaining 2 days post the 12 day dietary intervention period, participants are&#xD;
      free to eat and drink whatever they wish or choose from the list of recommended foods&#xD;
      provided to them. They will be asked to track all meals, snacks and drinks on their digital&#xD;
      app. Participants will also be advised not to change their physical activity patterns during&#xD;
      the course of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the baseline visit, regular contact will be made with the participants via phone, their&#xD;
      app and text messages for the period of the intervention to encourage compliance and answer&#xD;
      any queries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anthropometry: Weight, height, waist and hip circumference, blood pressure, body fat will be&#xD;
      taken using standard procedures, in duplicates by a trained researcher at all face to face&#xD;
      appointments. DXA scans using a Hologic machine will be used to assess body composition in&#xD;
      all participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dietary and Lifestyle: Participants will be asked to complete a simple online baseline&#xD;
      questionnaire plus record daily dietary and activity information using digital apps.&#xD;
      Lifestyle information (such as sleep, exercise and heart rate) will be monitored using&#xD;
      digital wearable devices. Dietary information and psychological data (eg hunger) will be&#xD;
      recorded in a digital mobile phone app. Training in all apps and equipment will be given at&#xD;
      the baseline visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Digital devices: Participants will be asked to record daily dietary and activity information&#xD;
      using digital apps and lifestyle information will be monitored using digital wearable&#xD;
      devices. The continuous glucose monitor (Freestyle Libre, CGM) provides continuous glucose&#xD;
      profiles for up to 14 days. The CGM will be inserted on the back of the upper arm at the&#xD;
      baseline visit by a nurse. Subcutaneous interstitial fluid glucose concentrations are&#xD;
      measured every 15 minutes by the CGM, and can be displayed on a remote device when necessary.&#xD;
      The readings will be blinded so that the participant's behaviour is not affected by the&#xD;
      glucose readings. The CGM will be removed at the end of the intervention period. Removal of&#xD;
      the glucose monitor can be performed by the participants at home and detailed instructions on&#xD;
      the removal procedure will be provided to them on day 1 of their visit. A 24-h contact number&#xD;
      will be made available to participants for any inquiries or if any problems arose. Data from&#xD;
      the CGM will be downloaded, and glucose profiles will be evaluated on the basis of data&#xD;
      collected on days 1-14.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood samples: Postprandial blood will be collected on day one in the clinic and on&#xD;
      additional days at home using finger-prick blood sampling.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Digital app: Participants will be asked to download an app designed specifically for this&#xD;
      study, which provides diet &amp; activity logging functionality similar to widely used existing&#xD;
      apps such as MyFitnessPal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be asked to record and monitor the following information via the digital&#xD;
      app and wearable devices:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Daily record of foods eaten throughout the day with serving sizes and photographs&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Continuous sleep and physical activity patterns&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Periodical hunger, satiety and appetite ratings&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Psychological feeling of energy and mood&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Daily medication consumption&#xD;
&#xD;
      During their baseline visit day, participants will be assisted with installation and setup&#xD;
      and provided with instructions on how to use the app. The app will be available in versions&#xD;
      for both iOS and Android operating systems, and will support a wide range of mobile phone&#xD;
      models as expected across the participant population. The app will synchronise remotely with&#xD;
      backend database servers, over an encrypted and authenticated API, and will support offline&#xD;
      operation for when patients wish to record an entry without network coverage. This continuous&#xD;
      background synchronization means that it will not be necessary to explicitly download data&#xD;
      from the phone at the end of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A subgroup of participants from Cohort 2 (n=50) who continue onto the home-phase will be&#xD;
      recruited to provide additional cardiometabolic measures, based on previously collected&#xD;
      metabolomic and phenotyping data. This subgroup will undergo an abdominal XMR scan and&#xD;
      cardiovascular tests at their baseline visit, before continuing onto the home-based&#xD;
      intervention.&#xD;
