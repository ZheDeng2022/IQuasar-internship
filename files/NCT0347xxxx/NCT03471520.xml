  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There has been some recent evidence to support the use of earplugs and eye masks to prevent&#xD;
      delirium, but the existing studies have been small, have not been thoroughly replicated, and&#xD;
      have only been conducted with intensive care unit (ICU) patients. Therefore, we propose to&#xD;
      conduct a single-arm pilot study for an eventual single-blinded randomized controlled trial&#xD;
      designed to assess the efficacy of earplugs and eye masks worn at night for prevention of&#xD;
      delirium in a population of general medicine inpatients over the age of 65. The primary&#xD;
      outcome will be incidence of delirium as measured by Confusion Assessment Method (CAM). In&#xD;
      this pilot study, we will assess feasibility and will not perform any statistical&#xD;
      comparisons. In the subsequent randomized controlled trial, we will be comparing the hazard&#xD;
      rates on an intention-to-treat basis. Secondary outcomes will be exploratory and include&#xD;
      length of stay, cost data, and use of pharmacologic interventions for sleep, delirium, or&#xD;
      agitation. There are no physical risks and no cost to the subjects in this study.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Admitted to General Medicine (units 8100 and 8300 only) from the Duke University&#xD;
             Hospital (DUH) Emergency Department&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age &gt;= 65&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Admitted from outside hospitals, clinics (i.e., direct admissions), or transferred&#xD;
             from another department&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Admitted as &quot;observation&quot; (i.e., expected length of stay &lt; 2 nights)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Admitted &gt; 24 hours prior to time of enrollment&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Non-English-speaking patients will be excluded because a language barrier would&#xD;
             introduce inaccuracy into the CAM measurement and for feasibility reasons (e.g.,&#xD;
             availability of translator services)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Blind or deaf patients will be excluded because they are unlikely to benefit from the&#xD;
             intervention, but sensory-impaired patients will be included&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients lacking decision-making capacity for whom no Legally Authorized&#xD;
             Representative (LAR) is available&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Primary reason for admission &quot;altered mental status&quot;, drug withdrawal, stroke, or&#xD;
             seizure&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients for whom a withdrawal pathway has been preemptively initiated based on their&#xD;
             substance use history (e.g., the alcohol withdrawal pathway order set or other as&#xD;
             needed (&quot;PRN&quot;) orders for the indication of withdrawal)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Delirium present at time of enrollment&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) &lt; 10 at time of enrollment&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Enrolled in this trial during a previous admission (i.e., we will not resample)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Enrolled in a separate trial this admission&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Contraindication to using earplugs or an eye mask (e.g., facial trauma or other safety&#xD;
             concern)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Significant fall risk per nursing assessment&#xD;
