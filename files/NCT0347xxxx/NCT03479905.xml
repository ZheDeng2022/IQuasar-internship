  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is standard practice in the United States and many parts of world to perform&#xD;
      Gastrointestinal endoscopy with the patient under deep intravenous sedation. Obesity is&#xD;
      accepted as a patient specific risk factor for hypoxic events during procedural sedation for&#xD;
      GI endoscopic procedures. The obese population has a higher prevalence of obstructive sleep&#xD;
      apnea (OSA), which is characterized by repeated obstruction of the upper airway, and leads to&#xD;
      apnea and desaturation. This prospective, randomized study was designed to compare the&#xD;
      effectiveness of the high flow nasal cannula, standard nasal cannula and standard face mask&#xD;
      in morbidly obese patients with a high risk of sleep apnea, (BMI greater than 40, STOPBANG&#xD;
      greater or equal to 5) receiving deep intravenous sedation during colonoscopies. This study&#xD;
      will assess which method leads to a lower incidence of intraoperative desaturation events&#xD;
      compared to the current standard of care.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The prevalence of morbid obesity is increasing worldwide. As the severity of obesity&#xD;
      increases, the incidence of diagnosed obstructive sleep apnea also rises. Studies have shown&#xD;
      an incidence of sleep apnea as high as 64% in patients with a body mass index (BMI) over 40&#xD;
      and 100% in patients with a BMI greater than 60. Patients with OSA have been shown to have&#xD;
      significant desaturations under intravenous sedation due to airway narrowing and obstruction.&#xD;
      Several studies have also shown that morbidly obese subjects, independent of a diagnosis of&#xD;
      OSA, run a higher perioperative risk of adverse airway events, including hypoxia. Providing&#xD;
      anesthesia for this patient population is challenging and requires careful titration of drugs&#xD;
      and superb airway management skills.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The current standard of care for oxygen delivery in this setting is a Salter nasal cannula.&#xD;
      Humidified high flow nasal cannula (HFNC) oxygen therapy utilizes an air oxygen blend&#xD;
      allowing from 21% to 100% FiO2 delivery and generates up to 60 L/min flow rates. The gas is&#xD;
      heated (35 to 40 degree Celsius) and humidified through an active heated humidifier and&#xD;
      delivered via a single limb heated inspiratory circuit (to avoid heat loss and condensation)&#xD;
      to the subject through a large diameter nasal cannula. Theoretically, HFNC offers significant&#xD;
      advantages in oxygenation and ventilation over conventional methods. Constant high flow&#xD;
      oxygen delivery provides steady inspired oxygen fraction (FiO2) and decreases oxygen&#xD;
      dilution. It also washes out physiologic dead space and generates positive end expiration&#xD;
      pressure (PEEP) that augments ventilation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Some studies have demonstrated a positive effect of HFNC on the apnea-hypopnea index (AHI)&#xD;
      showing that use of HFNC could decrease hypoxic episodes in subjects with repetitive upper&#xD;
      airway obstruction such as obstructive sleep apnea. The STOP-BANG questionnaire (SB) has been&#xD;
      used successfully to screen patients undergoing therapeutic endoscopic procedures at higher&#xD;
      risk for sedation-related adverse events.&#xD;
