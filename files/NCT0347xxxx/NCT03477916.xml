  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Obesity is increasing in western society at a rapid rate and is associated with metabolic and&#xD;
      cardiovascular disease. Although genetics, improper diet, and sedentary lifestyle are known&#xD;
      to be factors that can cause obesity, there is a new idea that certain gut microbes may also&#xD;
      be involved. Patients who are obese tend to have different kinds of gut microbes compared&#xD;
      with lean healthy individuals. Previous studies have shown that changing the gut microbes of&#xD;
      obese individuals by doing a fecal transplant (FMT) using gut microbes from a lean individual&#xD;
      improves insulin resistance. However, the effects were not maintained. In addition, research&#xD;
      has highlighted a necessary role for dietary fiber in the maintenance of microbes required&#xD;
      for human health and also that increasing dietary fiber can reduce inflammation that is&#xD;
      associated with insulin resistance. This project builds on the findings that gut microbes can&#xD;
      be modulated by both FMT and dietary fiber supplementation and will examine if combining&#xD;
      these two treatments can increase the effectiveness of these treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this study is to use fecal microbial transplant to change the gut microbes&#xD;
      of obese individuals to those seen in lean individuals and then to use fiber supplements to&#xD;
      help maintain the beneficial effects. In this study, overweight individuals who have&#xD;
      metabolic syndrome will receive a fecal transplant using a pill form and then consume a&#xD;
      variety of fiber supplements for 6 weeks. Effects on metabolic parameters, quality of life,&#xD;
      weight, and dietary intake will be followed. Microbial composition will be measured in stool&#xD;
      samples.&#xD;
