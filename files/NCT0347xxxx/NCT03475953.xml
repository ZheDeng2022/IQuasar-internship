      This is a multicenter, prospective open-labeled phase Ib trial based on a dose escalation&#xD;

      combination with Avelumab (no dose escalation for Avelumab) in patients with advanced&#xD;
      digestive solid tumors followed by independent phase II trials to evaluate the association of&#xD;
      Regorafenib at the RP2D with Avelumab in 10 cohorts of advanced or metastatic tumors :&#xD;
