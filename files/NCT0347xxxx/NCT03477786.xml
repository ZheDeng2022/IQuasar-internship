  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The BP4DM study was initiated as a prospective randomized controlled trial to investigate the&#xD;
      renal protection effect for tight blood pressure control for Taiwanese T2DM patients without&#xD;
      previously diagnosed CV events. We set our primary outcome for the prevention of&#xD;
      microalbuminuria development. The secondary outcomes include mortality, annual renal function&#xD;
      declining rate, and development of cardiovascular events. The recruitment period for the RCT&#xD;
      trial is from 2013 Oct to 2019 Dec. In addition, we also intend to continuously follow up all&#xD;
      our recruited hypertensive diabetes patients for at least 10 years to observe their clinical&#xD;
      outcomes including cardiovascular, renal, retinal outcomes and mortality.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The evidence from previous literature shows importance of the blood pressure control in T2DM.&#xD;
      About 20% (16-29%) reduction in microalbuminuria development can be reached by continuously&#xD;
      lowering blood pressure level from 154/87 mmHg to 144/82 mmHg (the UKPDS), to 134.7/74.8 mmHg&#xD;
      (the ADVANCE study), and even to 119.3/64.4 mmHg (the ACCORD study). However, several&#xD;
      limitations are also inherent in the above well-known studies. First, most of the recruited&#xD;
      participants previous trials were Caucasians. Although 3293 Chinese patients were recruited&#xD;
      in the ADVANCE study, they only accounted for 29.6% of total enrollees in that trial. The&#xD;
      representative of Asian population is inadequate. There is also lack of domestic&#xD;
      evidence-based guideline designated for Taiwanese T2DM patients in optimizing their blood&#xD;
      pressure control. In addition, some characteristics in Asian T2DM population are different&#xD;
      from what have been observed in the Caucasian T2DM patients. For example, there is BMI&#xD;
      discrepancy between T2DM in Western and Eastern countries, more ACEi/ARB side effects (e.g.,&#xD;
      cough) observed in Asian population, and the possible difference in CKD/ESRD incidence in&#xD;
      T2DM between different ethnic groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Moreover, the enrollees in most well-known trials (e.g., ADVANCE and ACCORD studies) were&#xD;
      those who suffered from at least one cardiovascular risk factor for secondary prevention. To&#xD;
      our best knowledge, there is no study designed to evaluate effectiveness of blood pressure&#xD;
      control for T2DM patients without previous CV events. Therefore, we initiated a prospective&#xD;
      randomized controlled trial to investigate the renal protection effect for tight blood&#xD;
      pressure control for Taiwanese T2DM patients without previously diagnosed CV events. We set&#xD;
      our primary outcome for the prevention of microalbuminuria development to partly respond to&#xD;
      the urgent need for this society in solving the huge burden caused by the high incidence and&#xD;
      prevalence of diabetic nephropathy in Taiwan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study includes two parts: (1) a RCT trial, (2) an observational cohort study. The&#xD;
      recruitment period of this study is from 2013 Oct to 2019 Dec. The RCT trial will be ended in&#xD;
      2019 Dec. In addition, we also intend to continuously follow up all our recruited&#xD;
      hypertensive diabetes patients for at least 10 years to observe their clinical outcomes&#xD;
      including cardiovascular, renal, retinal outcomes and mortality (the part of the&#xD;
      observational cohort study).&#xD;
