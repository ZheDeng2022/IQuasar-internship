  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study will evaluate the human abuse liability of PTI-821 (oxycodone extended-release&#xD;
      capsules) when administered nasally compared to crushed oxycodone IR tablets and crushed&#xD;
      OxyContin tablets, also administered nasally.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The nasal human abuse liability of PTI-821 will be compared to oxycodone IR using&#xD;
      pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic assessments. A comparison to OxyContin will be dose using&#xD;
      pharmacokinetic assessments.&#xD;

&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Evidence or history of clinically significant hematological, renal, endocrine,&#xD;
             pulmonary, gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, hepatic, psychiatric, neurologic, or&#xD;
             allergic disease (including drug allergies, but excluding untreated, asymptomatic,&#xD;
             seasonal allergies at time of dosing).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Diagnosis of substance and/or alcohol dependence (excluding caffeine and nicotine).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has participated in, is currently participating in, or is seeking treatment for&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Has a positive urine drug screen (UDS) excluding tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) at&#xD;
             Screening and the admission for Qualification Phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has a positive alcohol breath test at Screening or upon admission to the study center&#xD;
             for the Qualification Phase.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Other severe acute or chronic medical or psychiatric condition or laboratory&#xD;
             abnormality that may increase the risk associated with study participation or&#xD;
             investigational product administration or may interfere with the interpretation of&#xD;
             study results and, in the judgment of the investigator, would make the subject&#xD;
             unsuitable for entry into this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Positive test for Hepatitis B, Hepatitis C, or HIV at Screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Allergy or history of hypersensitivity to naloxone hydrochloride (HCl), oxycodone HCl,&#xD;
             other opioids, and/or lactose.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any condition possibly affecting drug absorption.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Physical (eg, constricted or collapsed veins) or mental obstruction (ie, phobia) that&#xD;
             would prevent serial blood sample collection.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Clinically significant illness in the judgment of the investigator within 30 days&#xD;
             before Screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Treatment with an investigational drug within 30 days (or as determined by the local&#xD;
             requirement, whichever is longer) or 5 half-lives preceding the first treatment during&#xD;
             the Qualification Period (Visit 2), if longer than 30 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Screening BP &gt; 140 mm Hg (systolic) or &gt; 90 mm Hg (diastolic) following at least 5&#xD;
             minutes of rest. If BP is &gt; 140 mm Hg (systolic) or &gt; 90 mm Hg (diastolic), the BP&#xD;
             should be repeated two more times and the average of the three BP values should be&#xD;
             used to determine the subject's eligibility.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant females; breastfeeding females; males and females of childbearing potential&#xD;
             who are unwilling or unable to use a highly effective method of contraception as&#xD;
             outlined in this protocol for the duration of the study and for 28 days after the last&#xD;
             dose of study medication. Urine pregnancy tests must be collected and confirmed&#xD;

             assessments required by the study. Examples include antihypertensive agents, drugs for&#xD;
             seizures, and diabetes medications. Hormonal contraceptives (oral, injected,&#xD;
             intrauterine, transdermal or implanted) are allowed in this study provided the subject&#xD;
             remains on the same treatment throughout the entire study and has been using that&#xD;
             hormonal contraceptive for an adequate period of time to ensure effectiveness. Limited&#xD;
             use of non-prescription medications that are not believed to affect subject safety or&#xD;
             the overall results of the study may be permitted on a case-by-case basis following&#xD;
             approval by the investigator. As an exception, acetaminophen may be used at doses of 1&#xD;
             g/day.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Blood donation (excluding plasma donations) of approximately 1 pint (500 mL) or more&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Unwilling to be searched (including personal effects) for illicit substances before&#xD;
             admission to the study center.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject is a heavy smoker (&gt; 20 cigarettes per day on average in the past 30 days&#xD;
             prior to Screening), chews tobacco, uses nicotine-containing products (including&#xD;
             nicotine transdermal patches), and/or is unable to abstain from smoking for at least&#xD;
             10 hours during any day.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Current pending legal charges or currently on probation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects who are investigational site staff members directly involved in the conduct&#xD;
             of the study and their family members, site staff members otherwise supervised by the&#xD;
             investigator, or subjects who are PTI employees directly involved in the conduct of&#xD;
             the study.&#xD;
