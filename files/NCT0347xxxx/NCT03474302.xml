  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is designed to develop and evaluate a physical activity promotion program among&#xD;
      elderly African Americans with a long-term goal of reducing risk of Alzheimer's disease. The&#xD;
      motivation for this study is that previous exercise interventions have improved cognitive&#xD;
      function in older adults with and without cognitive impairments, but these studies were&#xD;
      largely conducted without substantial African American representation. Due to genetic and&#xD;
      environmental differences between African American and other populations, it is unclear&#xD;
      whether positive findings from previous interventions will translate to African American&#xD;
      individuals. Investigators hypothesize that a community-based physical activity intervention&#xD;
      will a) be tailored to African American adults, b) increase daily amounts of physical&#xD;
      activity, and c) improve cognitive function in sedentary older African American adults.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Investigators will randomize 56 older African American adults into 1) a physical activity&#xD;
      intervention specifically tailored to older African American or 2) a successful aging group.&#xD;
      The 12-week physical activity intervention will consist of group based exercise sessions at a&#xD;
      community facility and the successful aging groups will occur at Pennington Biomedical.&#xD;
      Cognitive functioning and blood markers of circulating neurotrophic factors will be assessed&#xD;
      to determine the brain effects of physical activity in this understudied population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 1: To tailor a physical activity promotion intervention to community-dwelling&#xD;
      African American elderly adults. Investigators will use focus groups to gather information&#xD;
      needed to tailor a physical activity program to elderly African Americans.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 2: To determine if a physical activity promotion intervention in African&#xD;
      American adults is effective in modifying physical activity and biological markers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 3: To determine if a physical activity promotion intervention in African&#xD;
      American adults benefits cognition and brain health. Change over the course of the&#xD;
      intervention will be assessed in key AD related cognitive domains (memory, executive&#xD;
      function, and processing speed).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Collecting this data sets the stage for the definitive study of exercise benefits on measures&#xD;
      of amyloid, tau, inflammation, brain metabolism, and other AD-relevant pathways in elderly&#xD;
      African Americans, which could in turn increase understanding of neurobiological mechanisms&#xD;
      and optimal physical activity recommendations for elderly African Americans.&#xD;
