    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and preliminarily evaluate the&#xD;
      effectiveness of Plasmodium immunotherapy for advanced breast cancers and advanced liver&#xD;
      cancers.The treatment will last 4-6 weeks from the day of successful infection and will be&#xD;
      terminated by antimalarial drugs.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is to enroll 30 patients in each type of cancer. Each patient will be vaccinated&#xD;
      with P.vivax-infected red blood cells containing approximately 0.1-1.0 × 10^7 Plasmodium&#xD;
      parasites and be observed for the exact infection time, parasitemia condition and infection&#xD;
      course; principal clinical symptoms such as fever; gastrointestinal reaction; peripheral&#xD;
      blood parameters; the changes in heart, lung, liver and kidney function. Preliminarily&#xD;
      observe the changes in the primary and metastatic lesions of the cancer, the tolerance of&#xD;
      patients to Plasmodium infection, changes in tumor-related parameters and immunological&#xD;
      related parameters.The rate of the erythrocytes infected by plasmodium is controlled below&#xD;
      0.01% by using Artemisinin during the course, and clinical treatment is conduced according to&#xD;
      the microscopic examination to ensure that no serious complications occurs.The duration of&#xD;
      the planned treatment of each subject is 4-6 weeks. The time of the treatment course is based&#xD;
      on vaccination with P.vivax-infected red blood cells. After 4-6 weeks, parasitemia will be&#xD;
      terminated by antimalarial drugs for terminating the treatment of Plasmodium immunotherapy&#xD;
      (the immunological treatment effect may persist after the termination of Plasmodium&#xD;
      infection), and then the patients are followed up for 2 years.&#xD;
