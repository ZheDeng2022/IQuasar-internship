        Patients who are prescribed Deltyba速 per prescribing information (PI) for the purpose of&#xD;
        treatment can be included.&#xD;
&#xD;
        The expected number of patients during the enrollment period is 248 patients based on the&#xD;
        number of patients who might be taking Deltyba, which was estimated considering annual mean&#xD;
        change rate from 2009 to 2014 and the rate of patients who had no resistance to pulmonary&#xD;
        MDR-TB therapies2, 3.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Therefore, the target number of subjects is about 150, which is 60 % of the number of&#xD;
        patients who are expected to take Deltyba during the registration period (n=248).&#xD;
&#xD;
        The number of subjects may vary from one investigator to another.&#xD;
