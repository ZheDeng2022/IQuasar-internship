          <description>Etrolizumab 1.5 milligrams per kilogram of body weight (mg/kg) was administered by subcutaneous (SC) injection once every 4 weeks (Q4W) for a total of 4 doses over the course of the 24-week randomized treatment phase (16-week treatment period plus 8-week safety follow-up). Participants were then given the option to participate in the 312-week open-label extension (OLE) treatment phase with etrolizumab 1.5 mg/kg SC Q4W followed by the 104-week safety surveillance phase (no etrolizumab treatment) to monitor for progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML).

Participants were then given the option to participate in the 312-week open-label extension (OLE) treatment phase with etrolizumab 1.5 mg/kg SC Q4W followed by the 104-week safety surveillance phase (no etrolizumab treatment) to monitor for progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML).

        <title>Number of Participants With Adverse Events by Highest Severity Grade, Assessed According to National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, Version 4.0 (NCI-CTCAE v4.0), During the Randomized Treatment Phase</title>
        <description>All adverse events (AEs) were graded for severity using the NCI-CTCAE v4.0. Any AE not specifically listed was assessed per the following 5 grades: Grade 1 = mild; asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagnostic observations only; or intervention not indicated. Grade 2 = moderate; minimal, local, or non-invasive intervention indicated; or limiting age-appropriate instrumental activities of daily living. Grade 3 = severe or medically significant, but not immediately life-threatening; hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization indicated; disabling; or limiting self-care activities of daily living. Grade 4 = life-threatening consequences or urgent intervention indicated. Grade 5 = death related to AE. Not all grades are appropriate for all AEs; some AEs have fewer than 5 options. The terms &quot;severe&quot; and &quot;serious&quot; are not synonymous and are independently assessed for each AE. Multiple occurrences of AEs were counted only once per participant at the highest (worst) grade.</description>

          <title>Number of Participants With Malignancies by Highest Severity Grade, Assessed According to NCI-CTCAE v4.0, During the Randomized Treatment Phase</title>
          <description>Malignancies were graded for severity using the NCI-CTCAE v4.0. Any AE not specifically listed was assessed per the following 5 grades: Grade 1 = mild; asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagnostic observations only; or intervention not indicated. Grade 2 = moderate; minimal, local, or non-invasive intervention indicated; or limiting age-appropriate instrumental activities of daily living. Grade 3 = severe or medically significant, but not immediately life-threatening; hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization indicated; disabling; or limiting self-care activities of daily living. Grade 4 = life-threatening consequences or urgent intervention indicated. Grade 5 = death related to AE. Not all grades are appropriate for all AEs; some AEs have fewer than 5 options. The terms &quot;severe&quot; and &quot;serious&quot; are not synonymous and are independently assessed for each AE. Multiple occurrences of AEs were counted only once per participant at the highest (worst) grade.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants With Confirmed Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy (PML) During the Post-Treatment PML Monitoring Phase</title>
        <description>The 104-week safety surveillance PML-monitoring phase (no etrolizumab treatment) will consist of telephone calls approximately every 6 months with administration of the protocol's PML Subjective Checklist. If there are any signs or symptoms suggestive of PML identified on this subjective checklist during the telephone call, the participant will be asked to come into the clinic for a neurologic examination. The protocol's PML Algorithm will be followed for any suspected case of PML, and any confirmed case of PML will be reported as a serious adverse event.</description>
        <time_frame>Approximately every 6 months from last dose of study drug until the end of the PML monitoring phase (up to 104 weeks)</time_frame>

      <time_frame>From Baseline until 12 weeks after the last dose of study drug; primary results are presented for the randomized treatment phase (up to 24 weeks). Safety data is still being collected during the OLE phase and results will be updated after its completion.</time_frame>
      <desc>After informed consent but prior to initiation of study drug, only serious AEs caused by protocol-mandated intervention were reported. After initiation of study drug, all AEs were reported until the last study visit or 12 weeks after the last dose of study drug. After this period, only serious AEs related to prior study drug were reported.</desc>

          <title>Etrolizumab Q4W</title>
          <description>Etrolizumab 1.5 milligrams per kilogram of body weight (mg/kg) was administered by subcutaneous (SC) injection once every 4 weeks (Q4W) for a total of 4 doses over the course of the 24-week randomized treatment phase (16-week treatment period plus 8-week safety follow-up). Participants were then given the option to participate in the 312-week open-label extension (OLE) treatment phase with etrolizumab 1.5 mg/kg SC Q4W followed by the 104-week safety surveillance phase (no etrolizumab treatment) to monitor for progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML). All participants who chose not to enter the OLE phase after the 24-week randomized treatment phase entered the 104-week PML monitoring phase.</description>
