  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single center, single arm phase I trial to test the feasibility and safety of&#xD;
      Tumor- Infiltrating Lymphocyte-Adoptive Cell Therapy (TIL-ACT) followed by nivolumab rescue&#xD;
      in unresectable locally advanced or metastatic melanoma patients. The trial is based on&#xD;
      lymphodepleting chemotherapy followed by ACT, utilizing ex vivo expanded TILs in combination&#xD;
      with high dose interleukin-2 (IL-2) (optional, depending on patient's tolerance), followed by&#xD;
      nivolumab rescue (if indicated) for a maximum duration of 2 years.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The objective of the trial is to define the feasibility and safety of TIL-ACT in metastatic&#xD;
      melanoma patients. In addition, the feasibility and safety of nivolumab rescue in patients&#xD;
      with advanced metastatic disease is examined.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study treatment will begin with intravenous non-myeloablative (NMA) lymphodepleting&#xD;
      chemotherapy composed by fludarabine and cyclophosphamide. Both treatments will be started on&#xD;
      the same day. Fludarabine will be administered for five days, and cyclophosphamide for two&#xD;
      days. TILs will be infused intravenously over a period of 20-30 minutes. Between 3 and 24&#xD;
      hours after the infusion of TILs, optional IL-2 will be started as a bolus administration&#xD;
      every eight hours at minimum form the start of each administration, for a maximum of eight&#xD;
      doses, with a maximum interval of 24 hours. In order to avoid profound and long-lasting&#xD;
      neutropenia, pegfilgrastim will be given subcutaneously. Supportive care will be given during&#xD;
      the recovery phase from immune depletion and IL-2 therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nivolumab rescue will be initiated for eligible patients. For all patients, the first&#xD;
      on-treatment radiological assessment will be performed 30 days after the TIL infusion, and&#xD;
      then at month 3, and then every 12 weeks for the first 3 years of follow-up and every 4-6&#xD;
      months for the next 2 years, until progression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two Positron Emission Tomography-Computed Tomography (PET-CT) (18FDG (Fludeoxyglucose (F18))&#xD;
      and 68Ga-NODAGA-RGD ((68)Ga-labelled NOTA-conjugated RGD peptide) will be performed at&#xD;
      baseline, following chemotherapy, and between 22-30 days after the TIL infusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The safety assessment for TIL-ACT (TLT (treatment-limiting toxicity) period) will extend from&#xD;
      day -7 (when NMA chemo starts) till 30 days after TIL infusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first three evaluable patients will be enroled no less than 2 weeks apart from each&#xD;
      other. An interim analysis of safety at our center will be performed at the completion of the&#xD;
      TLT period of the third evaluable patient.&#xD;
