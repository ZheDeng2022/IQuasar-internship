  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Incorrect labelling of blood samples occurs at a rate of 1% in the general laboratories and&#xD;
      6% in Blood Transfusion Laboratories. The most serious error 'Wrong Blood in Tube' (WBIT)&#xD;
      occurs when blood is taken from the intended patient, but labelled with another patient's&#xD;
      details. Consequences may include, misinterpretation of a patient's diagnosis or clinical&#xD;
      status, incorrect referral or treatment of a patient, or in the worst case scenario,&#xD;
      incorrect cross matching for blood of the wrong blood group, which may lead to catastrophic&#xD;
      outcomes, including death.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The root causes for these errors is failure to identify the patient correctly and failure to&#xD;
      correctly label the blood tubes at the bedside. To date, despite significant initiatives, it&#xD;
      has proved very difficult to eradicate or reduce the error rate. Our project involves a&#xD;
      novel, technology enhanced learning approach using proficiency based progression in a&#xD;
      prospective randomised controlled methodology to significantly reduce this error.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This approach to learning is more efficient and effective than the traditional approach of&#xD;
      repeated practice and is made possible with metric-based simulations. This project will&#xD;
      reduce the incidence of adverse events and avoidable medical errors associated with sampling&#xD;
      and labelling errors including WBITs. This will be achieved by training healthcare&#xD;
      practitioners to a proficiency standard in venepuncture. Thereby minimising the failure of&#xD;
      health care professionals to identify the patient correctly and failure to correctly label&#xD;
      the blood tubes at the bedside.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This project's impact will deliver reduced sampling and labelling errors -including WBITs by&#xD;
      a factor of 40-69%. Reductions of this magnitude will have profound national and&#xD;
      international implications on how these types of skills are acquired and quality assured.&#xD;
      This would result in improved patient safety and savings of over â‚¬500,000 at Cork University&#xD;
      Hospital and if applied nationally result in exchequer savings of millions of euro annually.&#xD;

      The goal of the study is identification, development and operational definition and then&#xD;
      validation of phlebotomy performance Metrics which will be used to characterize the optimal&#xD;
      performance of healthcare practitioner's execution of phlebotomy. These validated Metrics&#xD;
      will serve as an educational and training tool to improve and quality assure phlebotomy&#xD;
      training. The validated metrics will be used to produce validated metric-based simulations&#xD;
      which will be used to establish a training benchmark based on experienced clinicians'&#xD;
      performance. It will also be used to underpin deliberate practice in simulated training.&#xD;
&#xD;
      By introducing proficiency-based progression training supported by technology enhanced&#xD;
      learning we aim for reductions in the error rates of wrong blood in tube of 40 to 69%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective 1 To characterize the process of taking a blood sample correctly and the correct&#xD;
      process for labelling a blood sample bottle and laboratory request form to reduce the&#xD;
      incidence of wrong blood in tube.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This will involve metric development and metric validation of the process of taking a blood&#xD;
      sample correctly and the correct process for labelling a blood sample bottle and laboratory&#xD;
      request form - as a result of a consultative process, including qualitative analysis of WBIT&#xD;
      errors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective 2 To quantitatively define a proficiency benchmark and then to design training to&#xD;
      the proficiency standard and assessment of proficiency up to and including real time feedback&#xD;
      to the doctor and patient in the clinical arena.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective 3 Design a new approach to training including assessment using technology enhanced&#xD;
      learning, incorporating online learning and simulation based training of taking a blood&#xD;
      sample to a proficiency standard.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective 4 To implement the training and assessment in the highest risk groups and document&#xD;
      the effectiveness of the intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The training will be delivered to all interns commencing work at Cork University Hospital on&#xD;
      July 10th 2017 as proficiency based progression simulation training with additional&#xD;
      systematic proximate feedback.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data from each training group will be identified using the laboratory tracking quality system&#xD;
      and using comparison with the historical data from the previous year(s).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective 5 To use the research data generated to recommend an evidence based training and&#xD;
      competency assessment approach to health care providers in Ireland, together with evidence&#xD;
      based individual feedback for any residual errors. This will allow us to internationally&#xD;
      address the universal problem of sample mislabeling and WBIT.&#xD;
