  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Over the last two decades in the field of oncology, the prevention, diagnosis, treatment and&#xD;
      rehabilitation have reached a remarkable development, improving healing rates and reducing&#xD;
      the number of deaths from cancer. The most frequent cancer in the female population is the&#xD;
      breast one, which consequences can become disabling. In recent years, surgeons need to find&#xD;
      more effective and less invasive treatments. Nowadays, despite the achievements, oncological&#xD;
      surgery can cause side effects that cannot allow the return to normal life. Some of these&#xD;
      problems are represented by the formation of edema and seroma, which can be handled by the&#xD;
      physiotherapist through the manual lymphatic drainage and the application of an elastic tape.&#xD;
      The elastic tape is used a lot in clinical practice, despite it lacks supportive evidence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary aim of the study is to verify the effectiveness of Kinesio Tex Tape in reducing&#xD;
      edema and seroma formation following complex reconstructive breast surgery. The secondary&#xD;
      goals are the evaluation of the quality of the scar, of the perception of pain, of the degree&#xD;
      of satisfaction and disability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is a controlled, monocentric, national, comparative, randomized, single-blind study. The&#xD;
      sample size is 60 patients who undergo complex reconstructive breast surgery. Patients are&#xD;
      divided into two groups: the experimental one (receiving standard treatment and Kinesio Tex&#xD;
      Tape application) and a group of control (just receiving standard treatment). To evaluate&#xD;
      edema and seroma, ultrasound is used; ultrasounds will be on the 1st, 15th and 30th&#xD;
      postoperative days (T0, T1 and T2); Vancouver Scar Scale is used to define the quality of the&#xD;
      scar (T0 and T2); to measure the subjective perception of pain and to evaluate the degree of&#xD;
      patient satisfaction, two VAS scales are administered (the VAS scale for pain is administered&#xD;
      at T0, T1 and T2, while the VAS scale for satisfaction is given at T1 and T2); Finally, to&#xD;
      assess the degree of disability, the DASH Questionnaire is used (T0, T1 and T2).&#xD;

      Screening at the first evaluation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The anamnesis for each potentially eligible patient will be performed to assess whether the&#xD;
      inclusion and exclusion criteria are met.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the selection criteria for inclusion in the study are met, the patient will be proposed to&#xD;
      participate in the study with the delivery of the patient information sheet and the form will&#xD;
      be delivered to obtain written and signed informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Only after having signed the signature on the form, the patient will in fact be eligible for&#xD;
      the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization assigns to each patient the treatment strategy assigned by the random process,&#xD;
      as well as the numerical code that uniquely identifies the patient in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once the randomization has been carried out, the following information will be collected at&#xD;
      the moment before the tape application:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Name and surname.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Age.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Profession.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Type of surgical intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Side of the surgical intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Previous or concurrent diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Eventual adverse events.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Thickness of skin and subcutaneous tissue, detected by ultrasound.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Thickness of liquid, detected by ultrasound.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pain referred by the patient (VAS Scale).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patient satisfaction level (VAS Scale).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Scar quality measured by the blind surgeon (Vancouver Scar Scale)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Disability of the patient (DASH Questionnaire)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening for subsequent evaluations:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following information will be collected:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Thickness of skin and subcutaneous tissue (edema) and serum collection (seroma) detected&#xD;
           by ultrasound.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Quality of the scar measured by the blind surgeon (Vancouver Scar Scale).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Subjective pain sensation (VAS Scale).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patient satisfaction level (VAS Scale).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Disability of the patient (DASH Questionnaire).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Kinesio Tex Tape strips are applied to the patient in the experimental group following the&#xD;
      technique of Dr. Kenzo Kase for lymphatic drainage. The choice of tape's length and of&#xD;
      strips' number to be applied is based on the area of the breast edema and / or presence of&#xD;
      seroma, which must be completely covered. The patch is cut into a fan strip: a length of&#xD;
      kinesio tex tape is solid at one end and cut to create 4-6 narrow strips or tails. Corners&#xD;
      are rounded to prevent detachment. The application area must be clean and dry. The major base&#xD;
      is positioned near the functioning lymph node stations closest to the edema and / or seroma&#xD;
      area. The bases and the tails of the fan must be applied with zero tension, while for the&#xD;
      central part is reached 15-25% of tension, which is created manually or by extending the&#xD;
      structures involved. Tails are applied in parallel, with a small distance between them.The&#xD;
      first application takes place on the 1st post-operative day, while the second is performed on&#xD;
      the 7th post-operative day. In the event that the tape is detached from one application to&#xD;
      another, it is necessary that the patient resume in the clinic for a new application, so as&#xD;
      to ensure continuity of the therapeutic effect; otherwise, the patient is eliminated from the&#xD;
      study. The experimental group also receives the expected standard treatment. By standard&#xD;
      treatment we mean physiotherapeutic evaluation and physiotherapy counseling. The educational&#xD;
      part, the demonstration of the exercises to be performed autonomously and the demonstration&#xD;
      of prosthesis mobilization are included in this treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Temporary or ultimately treatment interruption:&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are no conditions that allows to interrupt and then restart the study. If a subject&#xD;
      decides to interrupt the study, the decision will be ultimate and a conclusion visit will be&#xD;
      carried out in order to understand the drop out motivations; data will be analysed for&#xD;
      intention-to-treat analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      • Statistics considerations&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to assess the 1st co-primary endpoint (seroma resolution at 30 days) the percentages&#xD;
      will be compared; from our clinical experience we except the 50% of subjects without tape&#xD;
      will resolve seroma at 30 days, while 90% of subjects with kinesio-tape treatment will&#xD;
      resolve at the same time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to highlight this difference we will need to recruit 30 subjects per group with 2,5&#xD;
      % alpha error and 80% statistical power.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Regarding the 2nd co-primary endpoint (edema reduction), taking as reference the mean of five&#xD;
      ultrasound breast acquisition, a size of 30 subjects in each group and a 80% statistical&#xD;
      power will be required to determine a difference of 1.69 mm between null hypothesis which&#xD;
      establishes the mean of both groups is 10.00 mm and alternative hypothesis establishing the&#xD;
      2nd group mean is 8.31 mm, taking a standard deviation of 2.00 mm for both groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      • Statistics analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
      Demographics data and outcomes in the study will be analysed through descriptive statistics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In case of Gaussian distribution, the continuous variables will be described through mean and&#xD;
      standard deviation, while in case non-Gaussian distribution the continuous variables will be&#xD;
      described through median and interquartile range. Categorical variables will be described&#xD;
      through frequency percentages.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Considered variables' normal distribution will be verified through Shapiro-Wilk Test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the 1st co-primary endpoint (seroma resolution) at 30 days proportions will be compared,&#xD;
      and in order to make the survival analysis seroma resolution times will be considered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Curves will be estimated through Kaplan and Meier method and two groups comparison will be&#xD;
      carried out through log-rank test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the 2nd co-primary endpoint (edema reduction) means at 30 days will be compared through&#xD;
      repeated measures analysis of variance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The analysis will be conducted through intention-to-treat population analysis, considering&#xD;
      the two groups as randomized.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Also a confirmation analysis will be conducted on population who has correctly carried out&#xD;
      the treatment (per-protocol population).&#xD;
&#xD;
      • Ethical and regulating considerations:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This clinical study will be conducted according to the main laws drawn up by the 18th World&#xD;
      Medical Assembly (Helsinki, 1964) and to all the applicable amendments drawn up by World&#xD;
      Medical Assembly, and to the ICH guide lines for Good Clinical Practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This clinical trial will conducted with reference to all international laws and regulations,&#xD;
      and to national laws and regulations in force in the Nation where it is carried out, as well&#xD;
      as to each applicable guide line.&#xD;
&#xD;
      • Informed consent:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigator, or a person appointed by him and under his responsibility, will inform&#xD;
      exhaustively participants about all aspects pertaining to the clinical trial, according to&#xD;
      all the applicable regulating dispositions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will be exhaustively informed about the study, using words and language they&#xD;
      will be able to understand.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before taking part to the clinical trial the subjects will have had signed the informed&#xD;
      consent forms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients will be told they will be able to drop out the study whenever they want, without&#xD;
      any requested explanations, and that their decisions will not have any consequence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Every informed consent will be included in the investigator's files. The patient will be&#xD;
      given a dated and signed copy of informed consent.&#xD;

    <measure>Quality of the scar</measure>
    <time_frame>The measurement is assessed at 1st and 30th post-operative days.</time_frame>
    <description>The surgeon will make the evaluation of the quality of the scar using the Vancouver Scar Scale. The scale includes the following subscales: Pigmentation (M) in which the best score is &quot;0 = normal&quot; and the worst is &quot;2= Hyperpigmented&quot; , Pliability (P) in which the best score is &quot;0 = normal&quot; and the worst &quot;5 = contracture&quot;, Height (H) in which the best score is &quot; 0 = flat&quot; and the worst is &quot;3 = &gt; 5 mm&quot; and Vascularity (V) in which the best score is &quot;0 = normal&quot; and the worst is &quot;3 = purple. The subscales' scores are summed to compute a total score, where lower values represent a better quality of the scar.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Subjective perception of pain</measure>
    <time_frame>The measurement is assessed at 1st,15th and 30th post-operative days.</time_frame>
    <description>The subjective perception of pain will be measured using Visual Analogue Scale for Pain. It is a measurement tool mainly used to indicate subjective pain characteristics. It consists of a strip of 10 cm in which its extremities correspond respectively to &quot; 0 = no pain&quot;, &quot;10 = worst pain that I can imagine&quot;, where lower values indicate a good subjective perception of pain. The health professional asks the patient to mark the pain perceived at that moment on the scale.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Degree of patient satisfaction</measure>
    <time_frame>The measurement is assessed at 15th and 30th post-operative days.</time_frame>
    <description>The degree of patient satisfaction will be measured using Visual Analogue Scale. It consists of a strip of 10 cm in which its extremities correspond respectively to &quot;0 = no satisfaction&quot;, &quot;10 = maximum satisfaction&quot;, where higher values indicate a good degree of satisfaction. The health professional asks the patient to mark the satisfaction perceived at that moment on the scale.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Degree of disability</measure>
    <time_frame>The measurement is assessed at 1st, 15th and 30th post-operative days.</time_frame>
    <description>The degree of disability will be measured using DASH scale (The Disability of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand). It is a questionnaire concerning symptoms and abilities to perform certain activities that mainly require the use of the upper limb. For each subscale (30 items) the best score is &quot;1 = no difficulty&quot; and the worst is &quot;5 = unable&quot;. The patient is asked to assign a score from 1 to 5 for each activity reported by referring only to the operated side. For the activities contraindicated by the surgeon patients are suggested to give score 5, &quot;unable&quot;.&#xD;
On the 15th and 30th post-operative day the questions related to the activities of daily life refer to the past week, while on the 1st post-operative day the patients are required to consider the time passed since the intervention. The subscales' scores are summed to compute a total score, where lower values represent a lower degree of disability.</description>
