  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an observational, crossover study that will be examine use behaviors, chemical&#xD;
      exposures, and biological effects of SREC compared to TC use in subjects confined to a&#xD;
      research ward setting.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Daily cigarette smokers who are familiar with e-cigarette (EC) use will be instructed to use&#xD;
      only NIDA Standardized Research Electronic Cigarettes (SREC) and tobacco cigarettes (TC)&#xD;
      while enrolled on the study. Our overall goals are two-fold: (1) to compare nicotine and&#xD;
      toxicant exposure and pharmacological effects of SREC used alone vs tobacco cigarettes alone&#xD;
      (TC), or dual use; and (2) using SREC alone, TC alone, or ad libitum SREC use combined with&#xD;
      50% reduction in usual TC use as a model for dual use, to examine the extent to which&#xD;
      nicotine and toxicant exposure and biomarkers of potential harm compare among the 3 groups.&#xD;
      The former would inform the effects of total switching, the latter would inform the potential&#xD;
      harm reducing effects of smoking fewer TC while using EC.&#xD;

    <measure>Change in Mean score on the Modified Cigarette Evaluation Questionnaire (mCEQ)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline through study completion, approximately 2 years</time_frame>
    <description>The mCEQ use three multi-item domains (subscales) and two single items: &quot;Smoking Satisfaction&quot;, &quot;Psychological Reward&quot;, &quot;Aversion&quot;, &quot;Enjoyment of Respiratory Tract Sensations&quot; and &quot;Craving Reduction&quot;. Scores for each subscale are calculated as the average of its individual item responses of The items are rated on a seven-point scale ranging from 1 (not at all) to 7 (extremely). Higher scores indicate greater intensity of each smoking effect with, for example, greater satisfaction or psychological reward after smoking. Scores will be compared between SREC, TC, and dual use</description>

    <measure>Patterns of puffing</measure>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Mean score on the Minnesota Tobacco Withdrawal Scale-Revised (MTWS-R)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline through study completion, approximately 2 years</time_frame>
    <description>The MTWS-R features two separate measures for examining the severity of nicotine withdrawal symptoms in a participant: a self-report scale and an observer scale. The observer scale asks the scale-taker to rate the severity of four symptoms in someone the they know who is experiencing nicotine withdrawal: &quot;angry/irritable/frustrated,&quot; &quot;anxious/tense,&quot; &quot;depressed,&quot; and &quot;restless/impatient.&quot; The self-report version asks for rankings of the severity of those same four symptoms, plus eleven others that cannot be observed by outsiders (including such things as &quot;desire or craving to smoke,&quot; &quot;insomnia, sleep problems, awakening at night,&quot; or &quot;dizziness). Both scales use a Likert-type scale for the severity ratings, ranging from 0 (&quot;not at all&quot;) to 4 (&quot;severe&quot;). These scores are tallied to calculate an a total withdrawal discomfort score and will be compared between SREC, TC, and dual use.</description>

    <measure>Change in Mean score on the Questionnaire on Smoking Urges (QSU-Brief)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline through study completion, approximately 2 years</time_frame>
    <description>The QSU-Brief consists of 10 statements about the respondent's feelings and thoughts about his or her desire to smoke cigarettes as he or she is completing the questionnaire (i.e., right now). Each response is scored a number ranging from 1 (strongly disagree) to 7 (strongly agree) and total scores are calculated by summing the item scores to compare craving between SREC, TC, and dual use.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Mean score on the Positive and Negative Affect Scale (PANAS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline through study completion, approximately 2 years</time_frame>
    <description>The Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS) is a brief scale is comprised of 20 items, with 10 items measuring positive affect (e.g., excited, inspired) and 10 items measuring negative affect (e.g., upset, afraid). Each item is rated on a five-point Likert Scale, ranging from 1 = Very Slightly or Not at all to 5 = Extremely, to measure the extent to which the affect has been experienced in a specified time frame and the final score is derived out of the sum of the ten items on both the positive and negative side. Scores can range from 10-50 for both the Positive and Negative Affect with the lower scores representing lower levels of Positive/Negative Affect and higher scores representing higher levels of Positive/Negative Affect. The scores will be comparted between SREC, TC, and dual use.</description>
