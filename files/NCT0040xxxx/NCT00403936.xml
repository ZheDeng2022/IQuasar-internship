  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study was designed to determine whether a simple manipulative technique of relaxing the&#xD;
      tissues of the occipito-atlantal junction in the neck had any effect on the activity of the&#xD;
      sympathetic or parasympathetic nervous system. Subjects were dark adapted then measures of&#xD;
      pupillary activity, reflecting autonomic nervous system activity were taken before and after&#xD;
      treatment. The study hypothesis was that thet treatment technique would have no effect on the&#xD;
      pupillary measures, hence indicating no effect on autonomic system activity.&#xD;

      This study was a within subjects/crossover design in which each subject received the&#xD;
      treatment and served as his/her own control. 100 subjects were recruited from the&#xD;
      student/staff population of the university, were 18 y/o or older with no condition affecting&#xD;
      pupillary activity. Pupillary activity was measured with a PLR100 pupillometer and included&#xD;
      pupillary diameter, pupillary response latency, maximum constriction velocity and maximum&#xD;
      redilation velocity. Subjects were adapted to a dim light environment, measures taken,&#xD;
      treatment given at either third or fourth time period and measures retaken. The study was&#xD;
      approved by the NSU IRB. Subject numbers were sufficient to have statistical power to find an&#xD;
      effect. The study found an effect of treatment on maximum size, showing a decrease with&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
