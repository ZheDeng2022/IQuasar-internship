    <textblock>
      The purpose of this trial is to evaluate the safety, efficacy and pharmacokinetics of 100mg,&#xD;
      200mg , 300mg and 400mg once daily of OPC-67683, administered orally for 14 consecutive days,&#xD;
      in patients with uncomplicated, smear-positive pulmonary TB.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The four OPC-67683 treatment groups will comprise 12 patients each and the one standard&#xD;
      therapy (Rifafour e-275) group six patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Trial 242-06-101 is an exploratory and not a confirmatory trial and as such no hypothesis&#xD;
      will be tested statistically.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The control group, six patients treated with Rifafour, will serve as an control to confirm&#xD;
      the microbiological assessments during the trial.&#xD;

             hospital admission is warranted.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Rifampicin-resistant bacteria detected in the sputum susceptibility testing at&#xD;
             Screening.&#xD;
