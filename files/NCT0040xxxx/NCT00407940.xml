  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The rise of minimal access surgery has heralded the approval of a number of endovascular&#xD;
      devices with similar indications. This is particularly true for the treatment of lower&#xD;
      extremity ischemia. Comparable devices are selected for patient use somewhat arbitrarily,&#xD;
      often dependent on industry influence. An unmet need is NON-industry sponsored prospective&#xD;
      trials COMPARING devices head-to-head so that endovascular surgeons can even contemplate&#xD;
      evidence-based device selection. At present, we seek to compare two new high-technology&#xD;
      devices that are indicated to treat lower extremity arterial stenoses associated with&#xD;
      claudication.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Peripheral arterial disease affects more than 12 million Americans, and its incidence is&#xD;
      growing annually. The male/female ratio of patients with claudication is just under 2/1. The&#xD;
      arteries involved by atherosclerosis involve the arteries to the thigh and leg. These include&#xD;
      the femoral and popliteal arteries. Fifty percent of people with femoral-popliteal PVD are&#xD;
      symptomatic. Symptoms are typically related to exertional fatigue of thigh and calf muscles.&#xD;
      These symptoms, referred to as claudication, seldom represent a life or even limb-threatening&#xD;
      process. They do, however, result in significantly decreased productivity and an often&#xD;
      devastating quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Traditional interventions for lower extremity claudication include technologies invented in&#xD;
      the first half of the 20th century including surgical bypass; and those invented in the&#xD;
      second half of the twentieth century, including balloon angioplasty and stenting. These&#xD;
      interventions have substantial shortcomings. It is, however, relevant to note that&#xD;
      endovascular (aka endoluminal or endovascular surgery) is becoming increasingly popular and&#xD;
      gaining wide-spread support from vascular interventionalist societies wordwide.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main shortcomings of angioplasty and stenting is the resultant inflammatory response. The&#xD;
      mechanical injury to blood vessels is followed by a complex repair response comprising&#xD;
      intimal vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) hyperplasia, vessel wall scarring and shrinkage of&#xD;
      the vascular lumen, often resulting in reduced blood flow and subsequent muscle (or end&#xD;
      organ) ischemia. Rodent, rabbit and large animal models have provided valuable insights into&#xD;
      the pathophysiology of these responses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The devices utilized in this protocol are both FDA approved for the procedures described in&#xD;
      the protocol. The devices include the Silverhawk™ System (FoxHollow Technologies, Redwood&#xD;
      City, CA) and the PolarCath™ Peripheral Dilatation System, Boston Scientific, Natick,&#xD;
      Massachusetts). Hereafter both products will be referred to as the &quot;Devices.&quot;&#xD;
