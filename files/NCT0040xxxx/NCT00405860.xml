  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Microscopic polyangiitis (MP) is a primary systemic vasculitis predominantly affecting small&#xD;
      blood vessels. Following the widespread introduction of ANCA testing, the primary systemic&#xD;
      vasculitis (SV), Wegener?s granulomatosis (WG) and microscopic polyangiitis (MP) appear to be&#xD;
      more frequent than was previously thought (see definitions in Appendix 6). In addition, the&#xD;
      existence of early and organ-limited forms of these diseases, such as renal-limited&#xD;
      vasculitis (RLV) is now clearly recognized. Their annual incidence exceeds 20 per million per&#xD;
      year and they account for at least 5 % of the causes of end stage renal failure. The two&#xD;
      diseases share many features of their histology, serology and response to treatment, pointing&#xD;
      to similarities in their pathogenesis, which have justified a common approach to their&#xD;
      management. The standard treatment with corticosteroids (CS) and cyclophosphamide (CYC) is&#xD;
      usually effective at controlling active disease but continued treatment is necessary to&#xD;
      prevent disease relapse. Due to the cumulative toxicity associated with CYC treatment,&#xD;
      alternatives have been looked for. Mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) has been used to treat&#xD;
      patients with a variety of immune-mediated nephritides, including ANCA-associated vasculitis,&#xD;
      with less toxicity than CYC but with variable outcome. The present trial will examine whether&#xD;
      substitution of oral CYC with oral MMF is equally efficient for induction of remission with&#xD;
      less adverse effects in cases of MP with mild to moderate renal involvement. All patients&#xD;
      will receive the same regimen of oral prednisone + MMF. Prednisone will be tapered to a stop&#xD;
      after 24 weeks but MMF will continue for a total of 18 months unless there is worsening or&#xD;
      persistent disease. The trial ends after 18 months.&#xD;

      1. Patients will receive I.V. methylprednisone, or I.V. dexamethazone, oral prednisone and&#xD;
           oral MMF therapy as outlined in table 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. MMF will be initiated within the first 1-2 weeks of the start of steroids. Patients will&#xD;
           receive CellCept, 750 mg po b.i.d for the first week. Dose will be increased to 1000 mg&#xD;
           po b.i.d for the second week, and thereafter, according to blood levels and patient&#xD;
           tolerance. Target blood levels are 1 ? 3.5 &amp;#61549;g/ml. Treatment will be for a total&#xD;
           of 18 months. This is based on the published dose-dependent adverse effect profiles in&#xD;
           transplant patients (31-32) and on reports that lower doses are ineffective and shorter&#xD;
           courses (less then 6 months) result in relapses or failure of therapy (25). Dose will be&#xD;
           reduced in patient who can not tolerate MMF at the above dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2) Relapse treatment to follow guidelines for relapse regimens. 3) After 18 months, all&#xD;
      medications will be tapered to a full stop unless disease is active or grumbling.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4) Pneumocystis pneumonia prophylaxis will be used during the trial (with&#xD;
      sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim, or Dapsone or Mepron if allergic to sulfa).&#xD;
