    <textblock>
      Cholera is a severe diarrhea illness caused by bacteria. The purpose of this study is to&#xD;
      better understand how the immune systems of people in Dhaka, Bangladesh, fight infection with&#xD;
      cholera. Understanding immune responses that influence the outcome of infection with cholera&#xD;
      can assist in the development of more effective cholera vaccines. The International Center&#xD;
      for Diarrheal Diseases Research, Bangladesh (ICDDR,B) will enroll in this study 75 patients&#xD;
      with acute cholera and 250 of their household contacts. Individuals ages 2-60 years are&#xD;
      eligible. Study participation will last 1 year for cholera patients and 30 days for household&#xD;
      contacts. Participants will come to the ICDDR,B for 3 (household contacts) or 4 (cholera&#xD;
      patients) study visits, and field workers will visit them at home at other times. For all&#xD;
      participants, blood samples will be taken at each of the ICDDR,B visits. Household contacts&#xD;
      will have rectal swabs taken at 2 ICDDR visits and during field worker visits.&#xD;

      The purpose of this study is to investigate protective immunity to human cholera in Dhaka,&#xD;
      Bangladesh. Immune responses to Vibrio cholerae are poorly understood and have not been&#xD;
      extensively studied in an endemic setting such as Bangladesh. Understanding systemic and&#xD;
      mucosal immune responses that influence the outcome of infection with V cholerae can assist&#xD;
      in the development of more effective cholera vaccines. Identifying host factors, such as&#xD;
      human genetic variations or nutritional status, that affect the outcome of infection with V&#xD;
      cholerae can lead to an improved understanding of disease pathogenesis and better treatment&#xD;
      modalities. One of the likely key determinants of protection following either natural cholera&#xD;
      or vaccination is the duration of immune responses to key antigens, particularly at the&#xD;
      mucosal surface. This study proposes to assess the duration of immune responses in a group of&#xD;
      75 cholera study participants over the course of 1 year of follow-up and to correlate&#xD;
      baseline immune responses in 250 household contacts of the index patients, with protection&#xD;
      from disease over the subsequent 30 days. The researchers will assess the duration of&#xD;
      immunity in serum to known cholera virulence factors, including the serum vibriocidal&#xD;
      antibody and antibodies specific for LPS, cholera toxin, B subunit (CtxB), and TcpA. The&#xD;
      researchers will also measure antigen-specific memory B cells circulating in human blood,&#xD;
      which has previously been used to examine the longevity of B cell immunologic memory&#xD;
      following various infections and vaccinations. The objectives of this study are to determine&#xD;
      genes and proteins expressed by V. cholerae during human infection; determine which V.&#xD;
      cholerae proteins are immunogenic during human cholera infection in Bangladesh; assess the&#xD;
      duration of immune responses to V. cholerae antigens following an episode of cholera;&#xD;
      determine which anti-V. cholerae immune responses are protective on exposure to cholera in&#xD;
      household contacts; and evaluate selected host factors that influence the development of&#xD;
      immune responses following cholera, or susceptibility to symptomatic cholera following&#xD;
      exposure in household contacts. A total of 325 study participants (75 index patients with&#xD;
      acute cholera and 250 of their household contacts) will be enrolled. Index study participants&#xD;
      will be recruited from among patients presenting with acute cholera to the International&#xD;
      Center for Diarrheal Diseases Research, Bangladesh (ICDDR,B) hospital in Dhaka, Bangladesh.&#xD;
      Any individual with acute cholera between the ages of 2 to 60 years, inclusive, without a&#xD;
      severe complicating illness, and any household contact of the cholera patients between the&#xD;
      ages of 2 and 60 years, inclusive, is eligible for enrollment in this study. The length of&#xD;
      participation for each study participant will be 1 year for acute cholera index patients and&#xD;
      30 days for their household contacts. For cholera patients, study physicians will perform an&#xD;
      initial assessment and collect blood at various time points over 1 year. Study participants&#xD;
      (cases and household contacts) will come to the ICDDR,B for blood collection. On Study Days 3&#xD;
      through 6 and 8 through 10, a trained field worker will visit the household contacts to&#xD;
      collect information about symptoms and treatment of diarrhea and to obtain rectal swab&#xD;
      samples. Household contacts will come to the ICDDR,B on Days 2 or 3, and 7 (range 6-9) for a&#xD;
      questionnaire, rectal swab, and blood drawing. Questionnaires will be filled out upon&#xD;
      enrollment and at each study visit.&#xD;
