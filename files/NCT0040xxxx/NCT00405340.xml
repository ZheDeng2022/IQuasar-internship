  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Membranous glomerulopathy (MN) is still the most common glomerular disease associated with&#xD;
      nephrotic proteinuria (NS). Up to 40% of patients reach end stage renal failure (ESRD),&#xD;
      making MN the 2nd or 3rd most common cause of ESRD caused by a primary glomerulopathy.&#xD;
      Current treatment options include corticosteroids, alkylating agents, and cyclosporin, but&#xD;
      their use is controversial and the associated adverse effects and high cost temper their&#xD;
      usage. Experimental data in MN suggests that B cell activation results in immunoglobulin&#xD;
      deposition along the glomerular basement membrane causing injury to the membrane and&#xD;
      subsequent proteinuria. Drugs that non-selectively inhibit B cells and, these pathogenic&#xD;
      antibodies, are closely associated with improved outcomes. Based on the rationale that&#xD;
      selective depletion of B cells in humans would prevent the production of ?nephrotoxic?&#xD;
      immunoglobulins and subsequent renal injury we recently treated 15 patients with MN with&#xD;
      rituximab 1g i.v. twice (day 1 and day 15). Baseline proteinuria of 13.0±5.5g/24h decreased&#xD;
      to 9.1±7g, 9.7±8g and 6.5±6 g/24h at 3, 6, and 9 months, respectively (mean ± SD). Analysis&#xD;
      of the pharmacokinetic data obtained from this study, however, suggests that in heavily&#xD;
      nephrotic patients, rituximab dosed in this fashion results in patients being under-treated.&#xD;
      The present study propose to test the hypothesis that rituximab, given in accordance to the&#xD;
      standard lymphoma protocol (375mg/m2 x 4), will result in a more effective and profound&#xD;
      depletion of B cells, a more complete suppression of pathogenic antibodies, and a higher&#xD;
      remission rate of the NS while maintaining a favorable safety profile.&#xD;

      a. Study Overview: Once a patient with idiopathic MN and proteinuria &gt;5g/24h is identified&#xD;
      and meets other entry criteria, he/she will receive a minimum of 4 months of&#xD;
      non-immunosuppressive therapy aimed at maximizing Ang II blockade (run-in phase). The target&#xD;
      blood pressure (&lt;130 mmHg systolic BP &gt;75% of the readings; but not &lt;100 mmHg systolic) is&#xD;
      chosen based on recent recommendations by the JNC VII.(38) 1) The first step will be the&#xD;
      administration of an ARB. This is chosen because ARBs are as effective as ACEIs in blocking&#xD;
      the AT1 mediated adverse effects of Ang II, while being better tolerated, with minimal cough&#xD;
      or angioedema, and less hyperkalemia. Because this part of the study aims to maximize Ang II&#xD;
      blockade, ARB dose will continue to be increased every 2 weeks until the maximum&#xD;
      tolerated/FDA approved dose is achieved or until intolerable side effects occur (e.g.&#xD;
      development of postural hypotension, light headed, hyperkalemia, etc). 2) Once ARB dose has&#xD;
      been maximize and there are no observable side-effects, and/or blood pressure is not at&#xD;
      target, a long acting ACEi will be added. ACEi dose will be increased every 2 weeks aiming to&#xD;
      achieve maximum tolerated or maximum approved dosage. For patients whose blood pressure&#xD;
      control is not at target additional medication will be added in the following order: 3) a&#xD;
      loop diuretic, 4) a cardioselective &amp;#946;-blocker, 5) a non-dihydropyridine calcium channel&#xD;
      blocker (CCB), and 6) clonidine. The selection of these drugs adheres to the recommendation&#xD;
      of the JNC VII.(38) The choice of a non-dihydropyridine CCB was made because of concerns that&#xD;
      dihydropyridine-type CCB may obscure the anti-proteinuric effects of the above therapy. In&#xD;
      order to further ensure that any potential adverse effect is minimized we have limited CCB to&#xD;
      be used as a fifth agent, and to be used only when the combination of ARB/ACEi, diuretic, and&#xD;
      &amp;#946;-blocker have failed to reduce BP to target level. Concomitant Treatment: 1. At the&#xD;
      start of the run-in/conservative phase of the study, and as part of the standard of care for&#xD;
      patients with NS and severe hyperlipidemia, patients will be started on atorvastatin 10 mg a&#xD;
      day (or its equivalent) and if tolerated (no evidence of persistent elevation of liver&#xD;
      transaminase &gt;3x upper limit of normal, muscle pain, high CK, or rhabdomyolysis) the dose can&#xD;
      be increased according to the recently published KDOQI-dyslipidemia guidelines.(39) The dose&#xD;
      should not be increased above the maximum of 40 mg/day. The rationale for not using a higher&#xD;
      statin dose is because of the risk of developing proteinuria with the use of statins at high&#xD;
      doses. Patients will remain at the highest tolerated dose for the entire duration of the&#xD;
      study. Serum lipids will be measured at baseline and every 3 months thereafter. 2. High&#xD;
      sodium intake (e.g. &gt;200 mm NaCl/d or 4.6 g sodium/d) can significantly impair the beneficial&#xD;
      effects of Ang II blockade.(40) Therefore patients will be instructed to go on a low salt&#xD;
      diet (2-3g/day). 3. Patients will receive dietary counseling at enrollment regarding a&#xD;
      dietary protein target intake of 0.8 g/kg ideal body weight/day of high quality protein and&#xD;
      will be encouraged to maintain the same diet throughout the duration of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rituximab: If at the end of this period the patient still meets entry criteria he/she will be&#xD;
      treated with rituximab, 375 mg/m2 i.v. on days 1, 8, 15 and 22, with subsequent follow-up of&#xD;
      at least one year. Patients will be retreated at month 6th once B-cells return to circulation&#xD;
      and will be independent of the clinical status of the patient. B-cell return is defined as&#xD;
      CD19+B cell count &gt; 15/microliter or &gt;5% of baseline count. There will be a +/- 3 day window&#xD;
      for each study visit, to account for weekends, holidays, and scheduling conflicts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Figure 3. Schematic time-line for the study. Primary endpoint.&#xD;
&#xD;
      1. Change in proteinuria from baseline to 12 months. This approach was selected taking in&#xD;
      consideration that B cell recovery following administration of rituximab usually begins at 6&#xD;
      months after the last infusion, but it is not complete until 9-12 months later, (complete&#xD;
      recovery is defined as normalization of CD19+ B cell counts; normal CD19+ count is 71-567&#xD;
      cells/&amp;#956;l).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary endpoints.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Complete and partial remission rates at 6, 9, and 12 months (see definitions in Table 3)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Pharmacokinetics/bioavailability&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Rate of decline in urinary protein&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Frequency of relapse after CR&#xD;
&#xD;
