      To determine safety and effectiveness of dexmedetomidine when administered for conscious&#xD;
      sedation during flexible bronchoscopy (FB) in patients with Chronic Obstructive pulmonary&#xD;
      Disease (COPD).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a pilot study designed to provide preliminary data on the use of dexmedetomidine for&#xD;
      outpatient FB procedures requiring sedation. Clinical parameters such as vital signs, level&#xD;
      of sedation, dosing and supplemental sedation, and measures of comfort will be evaluated in a&#xD;
      population of patients with known Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease undergoing elective FB.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with COPD scheduled for outpatient FB will be provided with an intravenous infusion&#xD;
      of dexmedetomidine (1 mcg/kg/hr) (Precedex®: Hospira, Inc, Lake Forest, IL) over a 15-30 min&#xD;
      period before the procedure and continued throughout the procedure. No loading dose will be&#xD;
      used prior to start of infusion. The FB procedure will be conducted according to standard&#xD;
      practice using routine monitoring technique.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This dosing regimen of 1.0 mcg/kg/hr was chosen because the loading dose will be omitted and&#xD;
      since a previous review have documented a lack of adverse events with maintenance doses&#xD;
      exceeding 1 mcg/kg/hr.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Drug infusion will be discontinued if any of the following adverse events are observed:&#xD;
      recurrent apnea (Respiratory Rate &lt;7) lasting more than 30 seconds over a 5 min observation&#xD;
      period, sustained episodes (30 seconds) hemoglobin oxygen saturation lower than 90% over a 5&#xD;
      min observation period, decrease of heart rate to below 50 beats/min, mean arterial pressure&#xD;
      below 70% of its initial value.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If needed, additional sedation will be provided with alternating doses of midazolam 1 mg, or&#xD;
      Fentanyl 25 mcg for pain, agitation interfering with the completion of the procedure, or for&#xD;
      persistent cough non-responsive to local lidocaine instillation. The amount of Fentanyl and&#xD;
      versed used as an adjunct for conscious sedation will also be recorded as part of this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The quality of sedation will be assessed using the Richmond Agitation Sedation Scale. The&#xD;
      quality of analgesia will be assessed using the 11-point (0-10) Numerical Pain Rating scale&#xD;
      (NRS). The level of recovery from anesthesia and the return of psychomotor fitness will be&#xD;
      assessed using the Modified Post anesthesia Discharge Scoring System (MPADSS). The duration&#xD;
      of FB and the time from the end of the procedure to the patient reaching a score of 9 and 10&#xD;
      on the MPADSS (readiness for discharge) will also be measured.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Except for the measurements described above (NRS), no additional procedures will be performed&#xD;
      for the purposes of this study.&#xD;
