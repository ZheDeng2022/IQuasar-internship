      To determine whether intraoperative hyperglycemia potentiates renal injury in the setting of&#xD;
      cardiac surgery requiring cardiopulmonary bypass.&#xD;

      Significance:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Postoperative renal dysfunction is a common complication of cardiopulmonary bypass occurring&#xD;
      in nearly 8% of all patients undergoing myocardial revascularization. Both diabetes and&#xD;
      preoperative hyperglycemia are independent risk factors for postoperative renal dysfunction&#xD;
      after coronary artery bypass surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The cause of renal injury is multifactoral and in most cases involves renal ischemia from&#xD;
      alteration of renal perfusion, resistance, metabolic byproducts (free-radical species),&#xD;
      inflammatory mediators and embolic processes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the setting of ischemia, specifically, neuronal, hyperglycemia has been shown to worsen&#xD;
      neurologic outcome and interfere with wound healing-possibly increasing the incidence of&#xD;
      wound infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hyperglycemia is common during cardiopulmonary bypass in both diabetic and non-diabetic&#xD;
      patients as a result of altered glucose regulation during hypothermic conditions (body&#xD;
      temperature actively cooled to 28 degree centigrade) and, more importantly, from delivery of&#xD;
      cardioplegia to arrest the heart allowing for surgical repair in a non-beating heart. The&#xD;
      cardioplegia is rich in potassium, among other agents, believed to offer cardioprotection&#xD;
      during cardiopulmonary bypass and is prepared in Dextrose 5% and normal saline. On average,&#xD;
      each patient receives nearly 2 liters of this solution, amounting to 100 grams or more of&#xD;
      glucose. In this setting, hyperglycemia is also promoted from insulin suppression, stress&#xD;
      hormone induced gluconeogenesis and enhanced tubular resorption.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Only recently have perioperative clinicians become aware about potential ischemic effects of&#xD;
      hyperglycemia during bypass and the need to maintain 'tight' control of glucose to avoid&#xD;
      stroke. This practice, however, is inconsistent and mostly applied to diabetic patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We hypothesize that tubular injury may be exacerbated by hyperglycemia in non-diabetic&#xD;
      patients while undergoing hypothermic cardiopulmonary bypass and have undertaken this&#xD;
      prospective observational study to investigate the relationship between intraoperative&#xD;
      glucose and postoperative renal dysfunction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology:&#xD;
&#xD;
      We plan to study to 200 patients ≥ 50 years of age scheduled for procedures requiring&#xD;
      cardiopulmonary bypass whether for coronary revascularization or valvular surgery. After&#xD;
      informed consent is obtained each patient's preoperative lab values consisting of serum&#xD;
      glucose, urine glucose, creatinine and BUN will be noted. Each patient's pre-induction&#xD;
      hemodynamics will also be noted. During bypass, serum and urine glucose will be measured&#xD;
      every 20 minutes in addition to collecting information on temperature of cardioplegic&#xD;
      solution, lowest patient temperature, time of bypass, and use of diuretics, or vasoactive&#xD;
      drugs. Additional sampling of serum creatinine and glucose and vital signs will take place&#xD;
      upon arrival in the cardiac intensive care unit after surgery and throughout hospitalization&#xD;
      as is standard of care in cardiac surgery at this institution. No extra samples will be taken&#xD;
      but the standard measurements will be observed. The clinical outcome of interest is a new&#xD;
      onset of renal dysfunction defined as a post-operative serum creatinine change of 0.5 mg/dl&#xD;
      or greater after surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Male and female patients ≥ 50 years of age&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Patients undergoing on pump cardiopulmonary bypass for either myocardial&#xD;
           revascularization (coronary artery bypass graft) or valvular surgery (valve repair or&#xD;
           replacement)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Patients with insulin dependent diabetes&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Patients with preexisting renal dysfunction defined as Creatinine&gt; 2 mg/dl&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Patients in need of emergency cardiac procedures&#xD;

      At the following times when plasma glucose will be measured, an additional 6 mL of blood will&#xD;
      be drawn (from indwelling routine arterial line catheter) into EDTA tubes and immediately&#xD;
      centrifuged: baseline following induction, once during cardiopulmonary bypass, at arrival in&#xD;
      the intensive care unit, and the morning after surgery- totaling 24 mls of blood. The&#xD;
      platelet rich plasma will be withdrawn and one half of the volume immediately frozen for&#xD;
      subsequent HPLC measurement of BH2 and BH4. The remaining plasma will be subjected to&#xD;
      progressive centrifugation steps in order to concentrate the platelet fraction that will then&#xD;
      be suspended in buffer and frozen. VASP expression and phosphorylation will be determined by&#xD;
      Western blot.&#xD;
