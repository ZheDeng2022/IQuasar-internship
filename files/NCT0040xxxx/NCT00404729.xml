  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In the management of glaucoma, as for as in other optic nerve diseases, an important goal of&#xD;
      ophthalmologists is represented by the possibility of influencing visual function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this regard, Parisi et al [Ophthalmology 1999; 106:1126-1134.] suggested the intramuscular&#xD;
      treatment with Cytidine-5-diphosphocholine (CDP-Choline or citicoline) to improve&#xD;
      glaucomatous visual defects. In particular, recent studies reported the effects of citicoline&#xD;
      on glaucomatous retinal and postretinal visual structures evaluated by electrophysiological&#xD;
      examinations (PERG and VEP). It was observed that a 2-month period of treatment with&#xD;
      citicoline may induce improvement in both ganglion cell function (PERGs with increase in&#xD;
      amplitudes and shortening in times-to-peak) and in neural conduction along postretinal visual&#xD;
      pathways (VEPs with increase in amplitudes and shortening in times-to-peak). The effects of&#xD;
      citicoline on glaucomatous retinal and postretinal structures were not present 8 months after&#xD;
      the end of treatment. However, performing several 2-month period of treatment with citicoline&#xD;
      during a total period of 8 years, it was found a additional improvement of the glaucomatous&#xD;
      retinal and postretinal impairment [Parisi V. Doc Ophthalmol. 2005 Jan;110:91-102). In this&#xD;
      work, the investigators aimed to assess whether there similar visual function outcomes can be&#xD;
      reached by the oral treatment with citicoline in patients affected by glaucomatous optic&#xD;
      nerve disease as of as in other optic nerve diseases (i.e. non-arteritic ischemic optic&#xD;
      neuropathy)&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Participants: 30 patients with open-angle glaucoma (OAG) and 15 patients (mean age&#xD;
      64.6±3.3ys) with non-arteritic ischemic optic neuropathy (NION) were enrolled enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ten OAG patients will be untreated (NT-AOG, 10 eyes), while 20 OAG patients (T-AOG, 20 eyes)&#xD;
      and 15 NION patients (T-NION, 14 eyes) were treated with Citicoline (oral treatment:1600&#xD;
      mg/die per 60 days) (Cebrolux®, Tubilux, Italy).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: In T-OAG, NT-OAG and T-NION patients, Visual Evoked Potentials (VEPs)were recorded&#xD;
      in response to 15' checkerboard pattern stimuli.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VEPs were assessed 5 times during a total period of 360 days: at baseline conditions (0 day),&#xD;
      after two different cycles of 60 days of treatment (days 0-60 and days 180-240), and after&#xD;
      two different cycles of 120 days of wash out (days 60-180 and 240-360). In NT-AOG patients,&#xD;
      VEPs were assessed at baseline conditions (0 day) and after 60, 180, 240 and 360 days.&#xD;
