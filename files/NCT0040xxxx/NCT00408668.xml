  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test three candidate malaria vaccines in new combinations to&#xD;
      assess their efficacy at preventing malaria infection and triggering immune responses against&#xD;
      malaria.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Two of the vaccines ('FP9 ME-TRAP' and 'MVA ME-TRAP') have been designed at the University of&#xD;
      Oxford. The other vaccine (PEV3A) has been designed jointly between the Swiss Tropical&#xD;
      Institute and a Swiss company called Pevion Biotech Ltd. These are new vaccines that have&#xD;
      been given to only a limited number of people before.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We aim to test these vaccines by:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  assessing their ability to prevent malaria infection&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  determining how good they are at triggering a detectable immune response against malaria&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  studying their safety further&#xD;
&#xD;
      Volunteers will be given up to six vaccinations over three months and will then be exposed to&#xD;
      malaria infection. We do this by allowing mosquitoes infected with malaria to bite them under&#xD;
      closely regulated conditions and observing if and when they develop blood stage malaria. If&#xD;
      the vaccines provide some protection from malaria infection then either they will not develop&#xD;
      malaria after the bites or the time taken to develop malaria will be longer. If not all&#xD;
      volunteers are protected then we will be able to try and improve our vaccines by comparing&#xD;
      the immune responses of volunteers who are protected to those not protected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The information we get from this study may help to prevent malaria infection and disease in&#xD;
      those who live in endemic areas and in travellers. The results of this study will be&#xD;
      published in scientific journals and may be presented at professional meetings.&#xD;
