      Primary Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the maximum tolerated dose of the combination of cisplatin, imatinib&#xD;
           mesylate, and pemetrexed in metastatic malignant mesothelioma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To explore the biologic effects of cisplatin, imatinib mesylate, and pemetrexed on tumor&#xD;
           tissue by:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  histologic analysis of biopsy tissue&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  by non-invasive assessments of tumor vascularity performed before, during and after&#xD;
           treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  electron microscopy analysis of endothelial cell architecture after patient treatment&#xD;
           with imatinib mesylate&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To explore the effects of cisplatin, imatinib mesylate, and pemetrexed on surrogate&#xD;
           markers in serum.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the rate of response to therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the doses of the combination regimen of cisplatin, imatinib mesylate, and&#xD;
           pemetrexed that enables de-phosphorylation of platelet derived growth factor receptor&#xD;
           (PDGF-R) on malignant mesothelioma tumor cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the pharmacokinetic interaction between agents in this combination regimen.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Cisplatin is used to treat different cancers, including testicular, germ cell, head and neck,&#xD;
      bladder, and lung cancer. This drug has an atom-containing platinum, which is designed to&#xD;
      poison cancer cells, causing them to die.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pemetrexed is designed to block enzymes in the body that play a part in tumor growth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Imatinib mesylate is a drug that blocks certain proteins that play a part in the development&#xD;
      of cancer. Imatinib mesylate has also been shown to increase the effect of chemotherapy in&#xD;
      tumor cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before you can start treatment on this study, you will have what are called &quot;screening&#xD;
      tests.&quot; These tests will help the doctor decide if you are eligible to take part in this&#xD;
      study. You will have your complete medical history recorded and a physical exam, including&#xD;
      measurement of your vital signs (temperature, pulse, breathing rate, and blood pressure) and&#xD;
      weight. An ECOG performance status evaluation (a test looking at your ability to perform&#xD;
      day-to-day activities) will be done. Blood will be drawn (about 3 to 4 teaspoons) through a&#xD;
      needle in your vein for routine tests. You will be asked about any medications you are&#xD;
      taking. Women who are able to have children must have a negative blood pregnancy test. Also,&#xD;
      your tumor will be evaluated by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or computerized tomography&#xD;
      (CT) scans before the start of this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will begin taking imatinib&#xD;
      mesylate. Depending on when you begin treatment on this study, you may be asked to take 3, 4,&#xD;
      or 6 tablets of imatinib mesylate by mouth once a day. Your doctor will also ask you to take&#xD;
      folic acid tablets (or a multivitamin with folic acid) during the week before you receive&#xD;
      your first infusion of pemetrexed and then every day while you are on this study. You will&#xD;
      also be given an injection of vitamin B12. The vitamin B12 shot will be repeated every 9&#xD;
      weeks during treatment on this study. Folic acid and vitamin B12 will help to decrease the&#xD;
      risk of severe side effects from pemetrexed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After 1 week of imatinib mesylate and folic acid, you will receive cisplatin and pemetrexed&#xD;
      by IV infusion. Cisplatin (given over 2 hours) and pemetrexed (given over 40 minutes) will be&#xD;
      given on the first day of each treatment cycle for a total of 6 cycles. Each cycle is 28 days&#xD;
      long.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dexamethasone will also be given by vein before you receive pemetrexed. Dexamethasone will&#xD;
      help to decrease the risk of rash and nausea that may be caused by pemetrexed. Your doctor&#xD;
      will also ask you to take dexamethasone tablets by mouth twice a day (12 hours apart) only on&#xD;
      Day 2 of each cycle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Every 4 weeks, you will have a physical exam, including measurement of your vital signs and&#xD;
      weight. You will also have a performance status evaluation. Blood will be drawn (about 3 to 4&#xD;
      teaspoons) through a needle in your vein for routine tests. Also, at every 8 weeks, your&#xD;
      tumor will be measured by a CT or an MRI scan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After you complete 6 treatment cycles of cisplatin and pemetrexed, you will continue to take&#xD;
      imatinib mesylate tablets every day up to 1 month after the 6 treatment cycles. If you&#xD;
      develop any intolerable side effects or if your disease gets worse, your treatment on this&#xD;
      study may be delayed; the dose of the study drugs decreased until your side effects are gone;&#xD;
      or you may be taken completely off this study. Your doctor will talk with you about any&#xD;
      changes in your dosing schedule or in the doses of your medication after you been evaluated&#xD;
      in the clinic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After you have completed all of your treatment, you will have what is called an end-of-study&#xD;
      visit. At this visit, you will have a physical exam, including measurement of your vital&#xD;
      signs and weight. You will have an ECOG performance status evaluation. You will have blood&#xD;
      drawn (about 3 to 4 teaspoons) through a needed in your vein for routine tests. You will also&#xD;
      have your tumor measured by CT or an MRI scan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an investigational study. Both cisplatin and pemetrexed have been approved by the FDA&#xD;
      for the treatment of malignant mesothelioma. The FDA has approved imatinib mesylate for the&#xD;
      treatment of leukemia and certain sarcomas; however, it has been authorized by the FDA for&#xD;
      use in research only in the treatment of malignant mesothelioma. Up to 42 patients will take&#xD;
      part in this study. All will be enrolled at M. D. Anderson.&#xD;
