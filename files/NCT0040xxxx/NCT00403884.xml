      In this prospective clinical study SRT is performed with various pulse durations at 1.7µs and&#xD;
      additionally 200ns to evaluate the different clinical effects of both laser regimens. The&#xD;
      macular diseases to be treated are drusen maculopathy and geographic atrophy due to&#xD;
      age-related macular degeneration as well as diabetic macular edema and central serous&#xD;
      chorioretinopathy.&#xD;
&#xD;

      a new barrier of retinal pigment epithelium cells. If this theory is true, the destruction of&#xD;
      the photoreceptors causing visual field defects would be only an unwanted and unnecessary&#xD;
      side effect. Thus, SRT is able to avoid these unintentional side effects and to achieve the&#xD;
      benefit by just treating the RPE.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Conventional laser photocoagulation has been shown to be beneficial in a variety of retinal&#xD;
      diseases like age related macular degeneration (AMD), diabetic maculopathy (DMP), diabetic&#xD;
      retinopathy (DRP) or central serous retinopathy (CSR). There are several hints that the&#xD;
      positive effect is mediated by the RPE. The RPE is the main target of laser energy due to its&#xD;
      high amount of melanosomes and absorbs about 50 to 60 % of the energy applied to the retina.&#xD;
      Today conventional retinal laser treatment is performed using the continuous-wave argon laser&#xD;
      (514 nm). Generally the exposure times are longer than 50 ms, typically 100 to 200ms. After&#xD;
      application of the laser energy onto the retina usually an ophthalmoscopically visible&#xD;
      grayish-white lesion results from thermal heat conduction. Histologically a destruction of&#xD;
      the RPE, which is the primary absorption site, occurs, leading to an irreversible destruction&#xD;
      of the outer and inner segments of the neuroretina due to thermal denaturation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The effect of laser treatment to the fundus was studied by several groups. In vivo it could&#xD;
      be observed that argon laser photocoagulation of the monkey- and human fundus causes necrosis&#xD;
      of the RPE and a detachment of the RPE from Bruch´s membrane, budding of individual RPE cells&#xD;
      and a multilayered RPE formation in the area of laser irradiation by seven days after&#xD;
      treatment. Histologic sections revealed that by irradiating the RPE with a conventional argon&#xD;
      laser the whole area of the cells is destroyed and the choriocapillaris as well as the&#xD;
      vessels of the choroid are damaged. After laser photocoagulation RPE cells migrate and&#xD;
      proliferate to cover the defect. In vivo after mild coagulations as usually performed in&#xD;
      macular coagulation the RPE barrier gets intact again.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several macular diseases are thought to be caused only by a reduced function of the RPE&#xD;
      cells. Therefore a method for the selective destruction of the RPE cells without causing&#xD;
      adverse effects to choroid and neuroretina, especially to the photoreceptors, seems to be an&#xD;
      appropriate treatment (SRT). The selective effect on RPE cells, which absorb about 50% of the&#xD;
      incident light due to their high melanosome content has been demonstrated using 5 µs argon&#xD;
      laser pulses at 514nm with a repetition rate of 500 Hz. By irradiating the fundus with a&#xD;
      train of µs laser pulses it was possible to achieve high peak temperatures around the&#xD;
      melanosomes. This led to a destruction of the RPE, but only a low sublethal temperature&#xD;
      increase in adjacent tissue structures. This selective destruction of the RPE cells sparing&#xD;
      the photoreceptors without causing laser scotoma has been proven by histologic examinations&#xD;
      at different times after treatment. The first clinical trial using a Nd:YLF laser system with&#xD;
      a pulse duration of 1,7µs (100 pulses, 100 and 500 Hz) also proved the concept of selective&#xD;
      RPE destruction and demonstrated the clinical potential of this technique. However, one of&#xD;
      the problems concerning selective RPE laser destruction is the inability to visualize the&#xD;
      laser lesions. Therefore it is necessary to perform fluorescein angiography after treatment&#xD;
      to confirm the laser success and to make sure that sufficient energy was used. Since&#xD;
      dosimetry of such laser lesions is not known, test lesions with various energy and numbers of&#xD;
      pulses in non-significant areas of the macula - usually at the lower vessel arcade - have to&#xD;
      be applied to elucidate the energy levels required for treatment. If the RPE is damaged, or&#xD;
      the tight junctions of the RPE barrier are broken, fluorescein from angiography can pool from&#xD;
      the choriocapillaris into the subretinal space. Thus fluorescein angiography has been used to&#xD;
      detect a break of the RPE barrier. However, fluorescein angiography is an invasive method and&#xD;
      has as already described a potential risk for allergic reactions because of the intravenous&#xD;
      injection of the fluorescein dye.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The damage mechanism in SRT is more a thermo-mechanical one than a purely thermal one as in&#xD;
      conventional laser treatment due to the short-duration laser pulses in the&#xD;
      microsecond-regime. Thus, microbubble formation around the melanosomes inside the RPE cell&#xD;
      occurs during treatment, probably leading to disruption of the cell; this is in contrast to&#xD;
      thermal denaturation in conventional laser photocoagulation. The formation of microbubbles&#xD;
      around the strong absorbing melanosomes inside the RPE has been proofed as damage mechanism&#xD;
      during irradiation of the RPE with µs laser pulses. If energy is absorbed and converted to&#xD;
      heat the thermoelastic expansion of the absorbing medium will generate an opto-acoustic (OA)&#xD;
      transient. During irradiation of RPE with µs laser pulses a classical thermoelastic transient&#xD;
      will be emitted. Due to the formation and collapse of microbubbles around the melanosomes&#xD;
      during a successful SRT treatment, additional OA bubble transients will be emitted. This is&#xD;
      analogous to the emission of acoustic transients during formation and collapse of cavitation&#xD;
      bubbles. An OA based on-line dosimetry system can differentiate between a pure thermoelastic&#xD;
      transient in a subthreshold irradiation and OA bubble transients superimposed to the pure&#xD;
      thermoelastic transients in case of a successful treatment irradiation. Thus, SRT can&#xD;
      clinically be guided by this specific OA detection system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this prospective clinical study SRT is performed with various pulse durations at 1.7µs and&#xD;
      additionally 200ns to evaluate the different clinical effects of both laser regimens, which&#xD;
      were already determined to be safe in animal experiments. The macular diseases to be treated&#xD;
      are drusen maculopathy and geographic atrophy due to age-related macular degeneration as well&#xD;
      as diabetic macular edema and central serous chorioretinopathy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The beneficial effect in laser treatment of diabetic macular edema is thought to be&#xD;
      associated with the restoration of a new barrier of retinal pigment epithelium cells. A&#xD;
      similar effect is postulated in the treatment of drusen, central serous retinopathy and&#xD;
      macular edema after vein occlusion. If these latter theories are true, the destruction of the&#xD;
      photoreceptors causing visual field defects would be only an unwanted and unnecessary side&#xD;
      effect. Thus, SRT is able to avoid these unintentional side effects and to achieve the&#xD;
      benefit by just treating the RPE.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study the clinical effect of SRT for these diseases is evaluated on a long-term&#xD;
      basis. For diabetic macular edema previously non-treated eyes with focal or diffuse macular&#xD;
      edema are randomized to SRT or conventional treatment. Best corrected visual acuity has to be&#xD;
      at least 0.1 and no central ischemia must be present. The endpoint is visual acuity and&#xD;
      reduction of edema as determined by fundus photography, angiography and optical coherence&#xD;
      tomography. Regarding central serous chorioretinopathy visual acuity decay should last longer&#xD;
      than 2 months with angiographically seen leakage outside the fovea. Endpoint is visual acuity&#xD;
      and reduction of subretinal edema as determined by optical coherence tomography. Regarding&#xD;
      AMD drusen maculopathy has to show soft confluent drusen and hyperpigmented spots.&#xD;
      Angiographically a choroidal neovascularization has to be ruled out. Both eyes of the patient&#xD;
      must have symmetric patterns since one eye is treated and the other one observed. End point&#xD;
      would be a visual acuity and reduction of drusen as determined by fundus photography. For&#xD;
      geographic atrophy due to age-related macular degeneration both eyes of the patient should&#xD;
      present symmetric areas of atrophy. Laser treatment takes place at the rim of the atrophy&#xD;
      zone in one eye whereas the other eye is observed. Due to RPE proliferation induced by SRT&#xD;
      the major endpoint for this entity will be the stop or reduction of geographic atrophy&#xD;
      enlargement in the treated eye compared with the fellow eye. Visual acuity should be at least&#xD;
      0.1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will be followed at various times after treatment as derived from a strict&#xD;
      inclusion and follow-up protocol. The study is approved by the institutional study board and&#xD;
      ethical committee; patients safety is covered by a private insurance company.&#xD;
