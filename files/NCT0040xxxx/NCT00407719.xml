    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to see if the drug bevacizumab is safe and effective to use for&#xD;
      people with choroidal neovascularization (CNV). CNV is an eye condition where abnormal blood&#xD;
      vessels grow in the part of the eye responsible for central (straight ahead) vision. The drug&#xD;
      is produced using recombinant DNA technology and has been approved by the FDA for use in&#xD;
      colon cancer. Although not yet approved for people with CNV, the FDA has given permission to&#xD;
      use this drug in this study.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Bevacizumab is a recombinant humanized monoclonal antibody against VEGF. It has been approved&#xD;
      by the FDA for the treatment of metastatic colon cancer 18. We hypothesize that VEGF also&#xD;
      plays a role in the development of CNV in pathologic myopia. Therefore, employing a mode of&#xD;
      therapy that would decrease the risks posed to eyes with attenuated sclera, we have treated,&#xD;
      through special approval by the Pharmacy and Therapeutic Committee of the Johns Hopkins&#xD;
      University School of Medicine, two patients with persistent myopic CNV with intravenous&#xD;
      bevacizumab 19. Despite multiple treatments with PDT, the CNV remained active and vision&#xD;
      continued to decline in these two index patients. After four infusions of bevacizumab, the&#xD;
      CNV became inactive. Six months after the last infusion in each patient, the CNV showed no&#xD;
      evidence of activity or leakage on fluorescein angiography. Vision also improved in the&#xD;
      diseased eyes of both patients. The two patients tolerated the infusions well, with no&#xD;
      adverse events detected. In particular, blood pressure remained stable and no proteinuria was&#xD;
      noted on serial analyses of 24-hour urine collections. The Bascom Palmer Eye Institute at the&#xD;
      University of Miami has also recently reported favorable outcomes of bevacizumab administered&#xD;
      in repeated doses to 14 patients (age &gt; 65 years) with CNV secondary to AMD that has been&#xD;
      refractory to other therapies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We propose a non-randomized, open-label pilot study to evaluate the effect of bevacizumab in&#xD;
      patients with CNV due to any cause other than AMD. This design will allow us to closely&#xD;
      monitor safety and tolerability of bevacizumab while we evaluate 3 bioactivity outcomes.&#xD;
      Based upon dramatic responses in two patients with CNV due to myopic degeneration, we&#xD;
      hypothesize that treatment with bevacizumab may have major advantages over current standard&#xD;
      of care.&#xD;
