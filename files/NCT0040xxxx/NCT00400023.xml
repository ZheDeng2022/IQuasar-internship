  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1, open-label, randomized, 2-sequence, cross-over, pharmacokinetic (PK) study&#xD;
      evaluating the effect of the DPD inhibitory action of CDHP as an S-1 component compared with&#xD;
      FT alone on the PK of 5-FU in patients with advanced solid tumors. The study will be&#xD;
      conducted in 2 parts (Cross-Over Pharmacokinetic Phase and S-1 Extension Phase).&#xD;

               -  Patient withdraws consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Patient has toxicities that, in the opinion of the Investigator, require the&#xD;
                  patient's discontinuation.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Patient has an intercurrent illness that in the opinion of the Investigator&#xD;
                  requires the patient's discontinuation.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  The Investigator concludes that it is in the patient's best interest to&#xD;
                  discontinue therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Patient is willingly or inadvertently noncompliant in the opinion of the&#xD;
                  Investigator and requires the patient to be discontinued.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  During optional Extension Phase, the patient has objective PD (defined by imaging&#xD;
                  studies or clinical evaluation). g. During optional Extension Phase, the patient&#xD;
                  requires a recovery period of &gt; 4 weeks (ie, more than 3 weeks from the scheduled&#xD;
                  start date of the next cycle; see Section 4.5.4.1.1).&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  The patient completes the Cross-Over Pharmacokinetic Phase but does not choose to&#xD;
                  enter the optional S-1 Extension Phase.&#xD;
