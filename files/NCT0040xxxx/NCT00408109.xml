      This study will determine if an experimental avian flu (bird flu) vaccine is safe, whether it&#xD;
      has side effects and if it can stimulate an immune response in people. The vaccine being&#xD;
      tested in this study is made from DNA (genetic material) that codes for an influenza protein&#xD;
      called hemagglutinin 5 (H5), which is based on the protein from the bird flu virus. The study&#xD;
      will determine if the body creates resistance or immunity to the H5 protein. The hope is that&#xD;
      an immune response to this protein may protect against bird flu virus infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy people between 18 and 60 years old who have been vaccinated with the current season's&#xD;
      influenza vaccine may be eligible for this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants are randomly assigned to receive injections of one of the following: 1) study&#xD;
      vaccine at 1 mg dose, 2) study vaccine at 4 mg dose, or 3) placebo (salt-water solution).&#xD;
      They receive three injections about 4 weeks apart in the upper arm muscle. Participants&#xD;
      record their temperature and symptoms at home for 5 days after each injection, either on a&#xD;
      diary card or electronically using the Internet, and report any side effects to a study&#xD;
      physician or nurse as soon as possible. They return to NIH for clinic visits every 2 weeks&#xD;
      for the first 12 weeks, then at week 26 and at week 42 to check for health changes or&#xD;
      problems. Blood is drawn at all visits and urine samples are collected through week 10.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If a participant develops serious side effects, the study physician may decide that he or she&#xD;
      should not receive any further injections. However, all participants are asked to continue&#xD;
      the follow-up visits even if they do not get the full set of three injections.&#xD;

      Study Design: This is a Phase I double-blind, placebo-controlled study to evaluate safety,&#xD;
      tolerability, and immunogenicity of a recombinant DNA vaccine against the influenza virus&#xD;
      hemagglutinin H5. The hypothesis is that this vaccine will be safe for human administration&#xD;
      and will elicit antibody and T cell responses against the H5 protein. The primary objectives&#xD;
      are to evaluate the safety and tolerability of the investigational vaccine at a 1-mg and 4-mg&#xD;
      dose in healthy adults. Secondary and exploratory objectives are related to the&#xD;
      immunogenicity of the study vaccine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Product Description: The vaccine is composed of a single closed-circular DNA plasmid that&#xD;
      encodes the H5 protein with a CMV/R promoter. Vaccine vials will be supplied at 4 mg/mL. Each&#xD;
      vaccination will be 1 mL administered intramuscularly (IM) in the deltoid muscle using the&#xD;
      Biojector 2000 Needle-Free Injection Management System (Biojector). The placebo and diluent&#xD;
      is phosphate buffered saline (PBS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects: A total of 45 healthy adults, ages 18-60 years, will be enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Plan: Subjects will be simultaneously randomized at a ratio of 1:1:1 into one of two&#xD;
      dosage groups or a placebo group. Subjects and clinicians will be blinded to group&#xD;
      assignment. All subjects will receive 3 injections on the schedule shown in the schema. The&#xD;
      protocol requires nine clinic visits and three telephone follow-up contacts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Duration: Each participant will complete 42 weeks of clinical follow up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Endpoints: The primary endpoint is safety and tolerability of the regimen. The&#xD;
      secondary immunogenicity endpoint is H5-specific antibody as measured by hemagglutination&#xD;
      inhibition (HAI) assay at Study Week 12. H5-specific T cell responses measured by&#xD;
      intracellular cytokine staining (ICS) assay, enzyme-linked immunospot (ELISPOT) assays and&#xD;
      other immunogenicity assays at timepoints throughout the study may also be completed as&#xD;
      exploratory evaluations.&#xD;
