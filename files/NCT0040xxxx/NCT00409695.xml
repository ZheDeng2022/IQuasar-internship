      Primary Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the response and toxicity rate at day 56 of two different dose levels of&#xD;
           thymoglobulin (ATG) [anti-thymocyte globulin (rabbit)] as a treatment of&#xD;
           steroid-refractory acute graft versus host disease (aGVHD).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the response rate at day 28.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the overall survival and non-relapse mortality at 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the toxicity profile of thymoglobulin when used for the treatment of&#xD;
           steroid-refractory aGVHD in each of two dose schedules.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To characterize the pharmacokinetic profile of thymoglobulin in each of two dose&#xD;
           schedules.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To analyze biomarkers of cellular drug effect by quantifying T-cell apoptosis in aims of&#xD;
           finding the minimal effective dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine immune-reconstitution after administration of thymoglobulin to patients&#xD;
           with steroid-refractory aGVHD for each dose schedule.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      GvHD is a common side effect of a stem cell transplant. It is caused by a type of white blood&#xD;
      cell (a lymphocyte). ATG is designed to kill lymphocytes and is commonly used to help prevent&#xD;
      or treat GvHD and to treat steroid-refractory aGvHD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before you can start treatment on this study, you will have &quot;screening tests.&quot; These tests&#xD;
      will help the doctor decide if you are eligible to take part in this study. You will be asked&#xD;
      questions about your medical history. You will have a complete physical exam. You will have&#xD;
      blood drawn (about 2 tablespoons) for routine tests and to check for any viral infections.&#xD;
      Women who are able to have children must have a negative blood (about 1 teaspoon) or urine&#xD;
      pregnancy test. You will also have a biopsy of the site that is suspected to be affected by&#xD;
      aGvHD. The study doctor will describe the type of biopsy procedure you will have, which will&#xD;
      depend on the part of the body that is affected by the disease. If you had an earlier biopsy&#xD;
      performed that confirmed aGvHD, you will not need a biopsy repeated for this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are found to be eligible to participate in this study, you will be randomly assigned&#xD;
      (as in the toss of a coin) to 1 of 2 groups. Participants in Group 1 will receive a higher&#xD;
      dose of ATG by vein. Participants in Group 2 will receive a lower dose of ATG by vein. You&#xD;
      will have an equal chance of being in 1 of the 2 groups. Participants in both groups will&#xD;
      receive doses of ATG over 4-6 hours, 1 time a day every other day for a total of 3 doses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During this study, you will be able to remain on steroids and any other drugs you may be&#xD;
      receiving for treatment of aGvHD (such as tacrolimus or cyclosporine). You will also have&#xD;
      blood drawn (about 1 teaspoon) to learn the effect of ATG on the lymphocytes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will be taken off this study, if the disease is stable as determined by the study doctor,&#xD;
      if the disease gets worse, or you experience any intolerable side effects. If you are taken&#xD;
      off this study, your study doctor will discuss other treatment options with you.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After you finish receiving the study medication, you will come to the clinic at regularly&#xD;
      scheduled follow-up visits. At first, you will be seen in the clinic once a week for 1 month.&#xD;
      You will also have additional blood drawn (about 2 teaspoons) for biomarker testing (testing&#xD;
      that looks at how the drug is working in your body). After the first month of follow-up&#xD;
      visits, you will come in for visits every other week while you are on this study, which will&#xD;
      continue until you have at least 2 consecutive (back to back) evaluations of the disease&#xD;
      status to see if the disease is stable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an investigational study. ATG is FDA approved and commercially available. You and/or&#xD;
      your insurance provider will be financially responsible for the cost of ATG while you are on&#xD;
      this study. Up to 40 patients will take part in this study. All will be enrolled at M.D.&#xD;
      Anderson.&#xD;
