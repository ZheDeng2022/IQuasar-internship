    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical research study is to determine the safety and effects of giving a&#xD;
      special kind of immune cells called &quot;alloreactive natural killer (NK) cells&quot; with high dose&#xD;
      chemotherapy and allogeneic hematopoeitic stem cell transplantation with the goal of defining&#xD;
      the maximum tolerated dose of NK cells. The NK cells will be donated from a relative of yours&#xD;
      who has certain genetic type in their blood called HLA, that almost matches yours. The stem&#xD;
      cells you will receive will come from a separate HLA matched (HLA A, B, C, DR) relative or&#xD;
      unrelated donor. The safety of this treatment will also be studied.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      NK cells are part of the immune system (the cells in your body that fight disease).&#xD;
      Sometimes, NK cells react against and fight leukemia cells that are mismatched with your body&#xD;
      for certain HLA tissue type proteins. When the NK cells react, these cells are called&#xD;
      &quot;alloreactive NK cells.&quot;&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, researchers will collect alloreactive NK cells from the blood of a relative of&#xD;
      yours whose HLA proteins do not match yours exactly. The NK cells are separated from the&#xD;
      blood using a machine called a CLINIMACs system. This machine uses special kinds of cells and&#xD;
      magnetic beads to separate the NK cells. The drug interleukin-2 is then added to the NK&#xD;
      cells, to improve their function. The interleukin-2 will be washed out of the cell sample&#xD;
      before it is given to you. The CliniMACS System is a medical device that is used to separate&#xD;
      types of blood cells from blood that is removed from the body during leukapheresis. These&#xD;
      separated cells are processed for use in treatments such as stem cell transplants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are able to take part in this study, you will receive high-dose chemotherapy for 4&#xD;
      days. You will receive fludarabine over about 30 minutes daily as an intravenous (IV--through&#xD;
      a needle in your vein) infusion . You will also receive busulfan over 3 hours by IV once a&#xD;
      day. About 2 days later, you will be given the infusion of the alloreactive NK cells by IV.&#xD;
      Patients will receive one of 3 dose levels. Some patients will receive interleukin-2 daily&#xD;
      for 4 days to enhance the function of the NK cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Five (5) days after the NK cell infusion, thymoglobulin will be given to you by IV daily for&#xD;
      3 days. Thymoglobulin is an immunosuppressive treatment to reduce the risk of graft&#xD;
      rejection. Then blood stem cells will be administered IV from a different stem cell donor&#xD;
      whose HLA type matches yours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will receive the drugs tacrolimus and methotrexate to help lower the risk of a reaction&#xD;
      called &quot;graft-vs.-host disease&quot; (GVHD). GVHD is when the donated immune cells in the&#xD;
      transplant react against the body of the person receiving the cells. Tacrolimus will be given&#xD;
      by IV for about 2 weeks, and after that it is given by mouth as a pill for at least 3 months.&#xD;
      Methotrexate will be given as an IV injection for 3 to 4 doses over the first 11 days after&#xD;
      the stem cell transplant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will also receive the drug G-CSF (Neupogen) as an injection under the skin until your&#xD;
      blood cell counts reach a certain high enough level.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will need to stay in the hospital for about 4 weeks. After you leave the hospital, you&#xD;
      will continue as an outpatient in the hospital area, which means you will have to stay close&#xD;
      enough to be able to come back for any visits for at least 100 days after the transplant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will be asked to come back to the clinic at 3, 6, and 12 months after your transplant for&#xD;
      routine safety testing. This will include a physical exam, a bone marrow biopsy, and routine&#xD;
      blood draws.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an investigational study. The way the researchers make the alloreactive NK cells&#xD;
      using the CLINIMACs device is investigational. The CliniMACS device is not FDA approved. At&#xD;
      this time, it is being used in research only. Up to 18 patients will take part in this study.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Patients with age &lt;/= 70 years with one of of the following: Acute myeloid leukemia&#xD;
             past first remission, in first or subsequent relapse, in second or greater remission&#xD;
             or primary induction failure; Myelodysplastic syndromes with intermediate or high risk&#xD;

&#xD;
          3. Patients must have a haploidentical relative who is predicted to be alloreactive based&#xD;
             upon the presence of the relevant KIR genes and incompatibility with the recipient for&#xD;
             HLA C and Bw antigens.&#xD;
