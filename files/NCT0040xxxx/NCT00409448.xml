      This study will evaluate the effectiveness of an Internet-based psychosocial treatment in&#xD;
      improving problem-solving, communication skills, stress management strategies, and coping&#xD;
      among children who have had a traumatic brain injury and their families.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A traumatic brain injury (TBI) is caused by a strong blow, jolt, or penetration to the head&#xD;
      that disrupts normal brain functioning. A TBI can range from a mild concussion to severe&#xD;
      brain damage. Falls, assaults, and motor vehicle accidents account for more than 50% of TBIs.&#xD;
      Physical symptoms of a TBI can be subtle to severe and can include nausea, memory loss, mood&#xD;
      swings, blurred vision, and light-headedness. This type of injury can be very stressful for&#xD;
      families and can result in feelings of anxiety, burden, and depression among family members.&#xD;
      A child who experiences a TBI will often display new social and behavioral problems, leading&#xD;
      to further parental distress and increased family dysfunction. Recent studies have shown that&#xD;
      problem-solving interventions can reduce caregiver distress and improve child adjustment&#xD;
      following a TBI. However, access to skilled therapists and specialized care for this kind of&#xD;
      psychosocial treatment is often limited in many communities. In such communities, the&#xD;
      Internet offers a new way to meet the mental and other health needs of individuals with TBIs.&#xD;
      This study will evaluate the effectiveness of an Internet-based psychosocial treatment in&#xD;
      improving problem solving, communication skills, stress management strategies, and coping&#xD;
      among teens who have had a TBI and their families.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Families participating in this study will be randomly assigned to either an Internet-based&#xD;
      counselor-assisted problem-solving (CAPS) group or an Internet resource comparison group&#xD;
      (IRC). Participants assigned to CAPS will work with a trained counselor who will guide them&#xD;
      through a 6-month structured online problem-solving and skill-building program via one-on-one&#xD;
      videoconference sessions. Families assigned to IRC will receive computers, high speed&#xD;
      Internet access, and links to brain injury information and resources, but no access to the&#xD;
      CAPS Web site content. The effectiveness of CAPS will be assessed after treatment and at 6-&#xD;
      and 12-month follow-up evaluations.&#xD;
