    <textblock>
      This study will examine metabolic and biological factors in people with Li-Fraumeni syndrome,&#xD;
      a rare hereditary disorder that greatly increases a person's susceptibility to cancer.&#xD;
      Patients have a mutation in the p53 tumor suppressor gene, which normally helps control cell&#xD;
      growth. This gene may control metabolism as well as cancer susceptibility, and the study&#xD;
      findings may help improve our understanding of not only cancer but also other conditions,&#xD;
      such as cardiovascular function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy normal volunteers and patients with the Li-Fraumeni syndrome and their family members&#xD;
      may be eligible for this study. Candidates must be at least 18 years of age, in overall good&#xD;
      health and cancer-free within 1 year of entering the study. Participants undergo the&#xD;
      following procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood tests for routine lab values and for research purposes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  ECG and echocardiogram (heart ultrasound) to evaluate heart structure and function.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Resting and exercise metabolic stress testing: The subject first relaxes in a chair&#xD;
           wearing the facemask and then exercises on a stationary bicycle or treadmill while&#xD;
           wearing the mask. This test uses the facemask to measure oxygen usage by the body to&#xD;
           determine metabolic fitness. Electrodes are placed on the body to monitor the heart in&#xD;
           an identical manner to a standard exercise stress test.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Magnetic resonance imaging of metabolism: The subject lies on a bed that slides into a&#xD;
           large magnet (the MRI scanner) for up to 60 minutes. During scanning, the arm or leg&#xD;
           muscles are stressed by inflating a blood pressure cuff and by exercising the limb for&#xD;
           several minutes. Subjects may be asked to squeeze a rubber ball or exercise with a foot&#xD;
           pedal. Immediately afterwards, the pressure in the cuff is released and remains deflated&#xD;
           for 10 to 15 minutes. No more than three 5-minute episodes of blood flow stoppage are&#xD;
           performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Standard MRI scan of exercised limb to determine muscle volume.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Brachial artery reactivity test to measure blood vessel function: Before the exercise&#xD;
           stress testing, subjects lie on a stretcher while the brachial artery (artery in the&#xD;
           forearm) is imaged using a noninvasive ultrasound method. Artery size and blood flow&#xD;
           velocity are measured before and after inflating a blood pressure cuff on the forearm.&#xD;
           Vessel size and flow velocity measurements are repeated after 15 minutes and again after&#xD;
           administration of nitroglycerin under the tongue.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Oral glucose tolerance testing to test for diabetes: To assess sugar metabolism,&#xD;
           subjects drink a sugar solution. Blood samples are collected before drinking the&#xD;
           solution and 1 and 2 hours after drinking the solution.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Muscle biopsy (optional according to subject preference): Subjects may be given small&#xD;
           amounts of sedation for the procedure. A small area of skin over a leg muscle is numbed&#xD;
           and a small amount of muscle tissue is surgically removed.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      We have previously reported that TP53 (encoding p53 protein), one of the most frequently&#xD;
      mutated genes in human cancers, dose dependently modulates the balance between the&#xD;
      utilization of oxidative and glycolytic pathways for energy generation in human colon cancer&#xD;
      cells and mouse liver mitochondria. Though morphologically similar to their wild-type&#xD;
      littermates, mice deficient in p53 display a gene dose-dependent decrease in aerobic exercise&#xD;
      capacity, implying that p53 has functions beyond its well characterized cell cycle&#xD;
      activities. These current findings have broad implications in fields ranging from cancer and&#xD;
      aging research to cardiovascular physiology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the Li-Fraumeni familial cancer syndrome (LFS), affected individuals harbor a germline&#xD;
      mutation in TP53, hence they are heterozygous with reduced wild-type p53 activity. We&#xD;
      hypothesize that the heterozygous individuals will display alterations in aerobic capacity&#xD;
      and metabolism that previously has been unappreciated. This IRB proposal translates our&#xD;
      experimental observation to human subjects in collaboration with extramural groups studying&#xD;
      this rare familial syndrome. The results may not only help clarify why mutations of p53 gene&#xD;
      are so common in cancers by potentially conferring metabolic advantages in tumorigenesis, but&#xD;
      they may also give us an opportunity to understand a fundamental regulatory mechanism in&#xD;
      cellular energy generation relevant to other processes.&#xD;
