        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Histologically or cytologically confirmed malignant solid tumor (at diagnosis)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Relapsed or refractory tumors in which correct standard treatment approaches have&#xD;
             failed&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Measurable primary and/or metastatic disease: at least one bi-dimensionally measurable&#xD;
             lesion. For patients with neuroblastoma, measurable disease will be defined by the&#xD;
             modified International Neuroblastoma Staging System (Brodeur et al.1993). For patients&#xD;
             with osteosarcoma, measurable lesions are lung metastases and osseous lesions with&#xD;
             soft tissue tumor, in exclusion of completely calcified or necrosed lesion at study&#xD;
             entry. A patient with an unique osseous lesion without soft tissue mass can be&#xD;
             included in the study if the lesion is operable and thus accessible for histological&#xD;
             response assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  No more than one salvage therapy for relapse&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age at inclusion: 6 months to ≤ 20 years&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Lansky play score ≥ 70% or ECOG performance status ≤ 1&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Life expectancy ≥ 3 months&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Adequate organ function:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Adequate hematological function: neutrophil count &gt;= 1.0 x 10^9/L, platelet count&#xD;
                  &gt;= 100 x 10^9/L; in case of bone marrow disease: &gt;= 75 x 10^9/L; hemoglobin &gt;= 8&#xD;
                  g/dL&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Adequate renal function: creatinine &gt; 1.5 x ULN for age; If serum creatinine is &gt;&#xD;
                  1.5 ULN of age, then creatinine clearance (or radioisotope GFR) must be &gt; 70&#xD;
                  ml/min/1.73 m2 Adequate hepatic function: bilirubin &gt; 1.5 x ULN; AST and ALT &gt;&#xD;
                  2.5 x ULN (AST, ALT ≤ 5 x ULN in case of liver metastases).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Wash out of 3 weeks in case of prior chemotherapy, 6 weeks if treatment included&#xD;
             nitrosoureas, 2 weeks in case of vincristine alone; 4 weeks in case of prior&#xD;
             radiotherapy. Patients must have recovered from the acute toxic effects of all prior&#xD;
             therapy before enrollment into the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Able to comply with scheduled follow-up and with management of toxicity&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  All patients with reproductive potential must practice an effective method of birth&#xD;
             control while on study. Female patients with childbearing potential must have a&#xD;
             negative pregnancy test within 7 days before study treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Written informed consent from patient, parents or legal guardian&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Concurrent administration of any other antitumor therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have previously completed or withdrawn from this study or any other study&#xD;
             investigating gemcitabine or oxaliplatin.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have a serious concomitant systemic disorder (for example, active infection including&#xD;
             HIV or cardiac disease) that in the opinion of the investigator, would compromise the&#xD;
             patient's ability to complete the study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pre-existing sensory or motor neuropathy &gt;Grade 2 (excluding neuropathy due to disease&#xD;
             and/or surgery)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of allergic reaction to platinum compounds&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Are pregnant or breast feeding&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Presence of symptomatic brain metastases in patients with solid non-central nervous&#xD;
             system (CNS) tumors&#xD;
