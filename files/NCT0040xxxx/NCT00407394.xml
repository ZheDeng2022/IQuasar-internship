      Background: The current Integrated management of childhood infections (IMCI) algorithm&#xD;
      prescribes that children with wheeze and fast breathing presenting to first level health&#xD;
      facilities are given antibiotics if they continue to have fast breathing after two doses of&#xD;
      bronchodilator. The primary purpose of the algorithm is to prevent mortality due to bacterial&#xD;
      pneumonia. However, an unknown proportion of children managed in this fashion will have a&#xD;
      viral related wheezing illness or asthma rather than pneumonia. Although it is unlikely that&#xD;
      wheezing syndromes are a significant cause of mortality for children in developing countries,&#xD;
      these algorithms are likely to result in unnecessary administration of antibiotics as well as&#xD;
      inadequate treatment of recurrent wheezing illness. We do not have clear evidence about&#xD;
      whether antibiotics can be withheld in some categories of children with wheeze. It is clear&#xD;
      that wheeze can occur in bacterial infection and in addition co-infection with virus and&#xD;
      bacteria has been well demonstrated in several studies of pneumonia etiology in children.&#xD;
      Although some studies have found that children with more severe disease or who are blood&#xD;
      culture positive are more likely to be febrile at presentation, this sign is not sufficiently&#xD;
      sensitive or specific to determine whether antibiotics should be administeredSetting: The&#xD;
      study will be conducted in eight medical colleges situated in Lucknow, Nagpur, New Delhi,&#xD;
      Mumbai, Chennai, Trivandrum, Vellore, and Chandigarh. Design: This will be a multicentric,&#xD;
      randomized, double blind efficacy trial. . Hypothesis: The primary hypothesis is that the use&#xD;
      of oral amoxycillin for three days would be as effective, in terms of clinical cure on day 4&#xD;
      as compared to use of oral placeboMain objective: To compare the proportion of children aged&#xD;
      2 to 59 months presenting with non-severe pneumonia with wheeze whose respiratory rate does&#xD;
      not fall below the age specific cut-off after three doses of nebulized salbutamol, that&#xD;
      achieve clinical cure on day 4 on 3 day of treatment with oral amoxycillin versus&#xD;
      placebo.Inclusion criteria: Children aged 2-59 months with non-severe pneumonia based on WHO&#xD;
      criteria of respiratory rate above the age specific cut-off, audible / ausculatory wheeze.&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria: Children with severe disease, received any documented antibiotic&#xD;
      treatment in the past 48 hours, diagnosed asthmatic on maintenance therapy, complicating&#xD;
      acute non-pulmonary or chronic illness, known drug allergy, hospitalization in the past 2&#xD;
      weeks, history of measles within the last month, known immunodeficiency disorder, prior&#xD;
      enrollment in the study, residing in areas not accessible for follow-up or whose guardian&#xD;
      refuses to consent for the study. Sample size: Has been calculated to test the null&#xD;
      hypothesis. There will be 950 children in each arm. Thus each site is required to recruit a&#xD;
      minimum of 225 cases over 18 months.&#xD;

      Background: The World Health Organizations acute lower respiratory infections (ALRI)&#xD;
      management algorithms depend primarily on two key clinical signs: elevated respiratory rate&#xD;
      and chest indrawing. The current Integrated management of childhood infections (IMCI)&#xD;
      algorithm prescribes that children with wheeze and fast breathing presenting to first level&#xD;
      health facilities are given antibiotics if they continue to have fast breathing after two&#xD;
      doses of bronchodilator. The primary purpose of the algorithm is to prevent mortality due to&#xD;
      bacterial pneumonia. However, an unknown proportion of children managed in this fashion will&#xD;
      have a viral related wheezing illness or asthma rather than pneumonia. Although it is&#xD;
      unlikely that wheezing syndromes are a significant cause of mortality for children in&#xD;
      developing countries, these algorithms are likely to result in unnecessary administration of&#xD;
      antibiotics as well as inadequate treatment of recurrent wheezing illness. In both developed&#xD;
      and developing countries respiratory syncytial virus is the predominant etiological agent&#xD;
      responsible for bronchiolitis and wheezing illness in the first two years of life. Moreover&#xD;
      data from several studies demonstrates that respiratory syncitial virus (RSV) infection and&#xD;
      the bronchiolitis syndrome are a major component of the total ALRI in children living in&#xD;
      developing countries. The relevant literature on therapy includes studies in which children&#xD;
      were labelled as bronchiolitis and others in which children were classified as wheezing&#xD;
      illness.We do not have clear evidence about whether antibiotics can be withheld in some&#xD;
      categories of children with wheeze. It is clear that wheeze can occur in bacterial infection&#xD;
      and in addition co-infection with virus and bacteria has been well demonstrated in several&#xD;
      studies of pneumonia etiology in children. Although some studies have found that children&#xD;
      with more severe disease or who are blood culture positive are more likely to be febrile at&#xD;
      presentation, this sign is not sufficiently sensitive or specific to determine whether&#xD;
      antibiotics should be administered.There has been extensive debate about whether infants and&#xD;
      young children in the first year of life respond to bronchodilator therapy. Proposed reasons&#xD;
      for a lack of response have included: immaturity of bronchiolar smooth muscle, increased&#xD;
      dynamic airway closure and relatively larger degrees of mucosal edema. A literature search&#xD;
      between 1980 and 2000 reveals five randomized placebo controlled trials of beta agonist&#xD;
      administered to acutely wheezing infants in which clinical outcomes were determined. Overall&#xD;
      these studies support the hypothesis that children aged less than 12 to 18 months are less&#xD;
      responsive to bronchodilator therapy than older children. However, they also demonstrate that&#xD;
      use of inhaled short acting bronchodilators for the acute treatment of wheeze offers some&#xD;
      benefits for clinical outcomes even in this young age group. The benefits of beta agonists&#xD;
      may be restricted to children with recurrent wheezing and at most provide a very small&#xD;
      clinical benefitSetting: The study will be conducted in eight medical colleges situated in&#xD;
      New Delhi, Chandigarh, Lucknow, Mumbai, Nagpur, Chennai, Vellore and Trivandrum. Design: This&#xD;
      will be a multicentric, randomized, double blind efficacy trial. Block randomization will be&#xD;
      done in Dept. of Pharmacology, KGMU, Lucknow, which is not the coordinating center for the&#xD;
      trial. Blocks will be generated in mixed batches. The medicines will be then placed in by the&#xD;
      pharmacy according to the intervention type determined by the pharmacy. Two hundred and&#xD;
      twenty five random numbers will be generated in blocks of varying lengths for each of the&#xD;
      nine sites.OutcomesPrimary: Clinical Cure: Respiratory rate below agerate below ages specific&#xD;
      cut-off (&lt;50 bpm in infants &lt;1 year and &lt;40 bpm in ages 12 - 59 months) and absence of&#xD;
      auscultatory as well as audible wheeze.Secondary: Response to nebulization: Respiratory rate&#xD;
      below age specific cut-off (&lt;50 bpm in infants &lt;1 year and &lt;40 bpm in ages 12 - 59 months)&#xD;
      after a maximum of three doses of nebuliaztion with salbutamol, auscultaroy wheeze may or may&#xD;
      not be present. But there is no audible wheeze.Clinical failure of therapy: Any signs of&#xD;
      severe pneumonia or severe disease; chest in drawing, convulsions, drowsiness or inability to&#xD;
      drink at any time; Respiratory rate above age specific cut-off on day 4 or after that (with&#xD;
      or without wheeze);Oxygen saturation on pulse oximetry &lt;90% on day 4 or after that;&#xD;
      Documented axillary temperature &gt; 101 degrees Fahrenheit. In addition, children who die&#xD;
      within the follow-up period of 14 days or are lost to follow-up on day 4 will also be&#xD;
      considered as failed.Clinical relapse at day 7- 15: Signs of severe pneumonia or very severe&#xD;
      disease among cases who were clinically cured on day 4 follow-up.Hypothesis: The primary&#xD;
      hypothesis is that the use of oral amoxycillin for three days would be as effective, in terms&#xD;
      of clinical cure on day 4 as compared to use of oral placebo. Intervention: Amoxycillin&#xD;
      tablets (125 mg) or placebo They will be used after dissolving in 5 ml of clean water. The&#xD;
      medicines will be given according to the weight of the child as follows:q 4 - 6 KG ½ tablet&#xD;
      thrice a dayq 7 - 10 KG 1 tablet thrice a dayq 11 - 15 KG 1 ½ tablet thrice a dayq 16 - 20 KG&#xD;
      2 tablets thrice a dayMain objective: To compare the proportion of children aged 2 to 59&#xD;
      months presenting with non-severe pneumonia with wheeze whose respiratory rate does not fall&#xD;
      below the age specific cut-off after three doses of nebulized salbutamol, that achieve&#xD;
      clinical cure on day 4 on 3 day of treatment with oral amoxycillin versus placeboSecondary&#xD;
      objectives: Among all cases of non-severe pneumonia with wheeze1. To assess the proportion of&#xD;
      children aged 2 to 59 months presenting with non-severe pneumonia with wheezing audible&#xD;
      wheeze2. To assess the proportion of children aged 2 to 59 months presenting with non-severe&#xD;
      pneumonia with wheezing who respond to up to three doses of nebulization with&#xD;
      salbutamol.Among cases of non-severe pneumonia with wheeze aged 2 to 59 months who respond to&#xD;
      three doses of salbutamol3. To assess the proportion of who fail therapy at day 4 of the&#xD;
      initial successful bronchodilator therapy with inhaled salbutamol.4. To assess the proportion&#xD;
      relapse at day 11- 14 of the initial successful bronchodilator therapy with inhaled&#xD;
      salbutamol.5.To compare the cost of treatment of clinical failures and relapses among those&#xD;
      treated with oral salbutamol.6 .To assess the association of bronchodilator response with&#xD;
      age, season, number of previous wheezing episodes, audible versus auscultatory wheeze and&#xD;
      family history of asthma.7.To assess the association of relapse in children who showed&#xD;
      improvement after being treated with inhaled salbutamol, with age, respiratory syncytial&#xD;
      virus (RSV) isolation, season, number of previous wheezing episodes, audible versus&#xD;
      auscultatory wheeze and family history of asthma.Among cases of non-severe pneumonia with&#xD;
      wheeze aged 2 to 59 months who do not respond to three doses of salbutamol8.To compare the&#xD;
      proportion of children who are judged to be clinically cured after 3 days of treatment but&#xD;
      who relapse within the next 11-14 days observation on 3-day treatment with oral amoxycillin&#xD;
      versus placebo.9.To compare the cost of treatment of clinical failures and relapses among&#xD;
      those treated with oral amoxycillin or placebo.10. To assess the association of clinical&#xD;
      failure on day 4 with age, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) isolation, season, number of&#xD;
      previous wheezing episodes, audible versus auscultatory wheeze, family history of asthma and&#xD;
      randomization to amoxycillin therapy.Inclusion criteria: Children aged 2-59 months with&#xD;
      non-severe pneumonia based on WHO criteria of respiratory rate above the age specific&#xD;
      cut-off, audible / ausculatory wheeze, accessible to follow up, whose guardians give written&#xD;
      informed consent.Exclusion criteria: Children with severe disease, received any documented&#xD;
      antibiotic treatment in the past 48 hours, diagnosed asthmatic on maintenance therapy,&#xD;
      complicating acute non-pulmonary or chronic illness, known drug allergy, hospitalization in&#xD;
      the past 2 weeks, measles or history of measles within the last month, known immunodeficiency&#xD;
      disorder, prior enrollment in the study, residing in areas not accessible for follow-up or&#xD;
      whose guardian refuses to consent for the study. Radiological Pneumonia on X-Ray.Sample size:&#xD;
      Two modes of therapies will be assumed to be equal if the failure rate in new regimen is not&#xD;
      more than 17%. So each site will be required to recruit and follow up 225 cases in each arm&#xD;
      over 18 months. Thus there will be 950 children in each arm.Policy relevance: The present&#xD;
      study plans to evaluate the role of antibiotic in children with non-severe pneumonia&#xD;
      presenting with wheeze. It will define the patient and disease characteristics associated&#xD;
      with clinical failure and the need for antibiotics. The results of the study will formulate&#xD;
      policy to use antibiotics in children with non-severe pneumonia and wheeze.&#xD;
