  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if the combination of everolimus and imatinib will&#xD;
      slow the growth of or cause a reduction in the size of the cancer, and to determine the side&#xD;
      effects of the combination in patients with melanoma. Each of the drugs in this combination,&#xD;
      if used alone, would not be expected to have an effect against the cancer. However, when used&#xD;
      together, there is a possibility that they could work together to damage the cancer cells, or&#xD;
      to block the formation or function of the blood vessels that feed the cancer, either of which&#xD;
      could result in slowing the growth of or shrinking the cancer. Both drugs work by blocking&#xD;
      signals that are sent from outside of a cell to the inside of the cell that direct the cell&#xD;
      to make certain substances to keep the cell alive. Cancer cells or blood vessels that feed&#xD;
      cancer cells may be more sensitive to drugs that block these signals.&#xD;

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have histologically confirmed stage III unresectable or stage IV&#xD;
             metastatic melanoma. Patients must have measurable disease as defined by RECIST&#xD;
             criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with up to 1 prior cytotoxic regimen for metastatic disease will be eligible.&#xD;
             There will be no prior limitation on adjuvant therapies for stage II/III disease or&#xD;
             for patients with stage IV disease treated after resection of all metastatic disease.&#xD;
             There will be no prior limitation on biological or hormonal therapies (immune&#xD;
             therapies, interferon, hypomethylating agents, histone deacetylase inhibitors, etc.),&#xD;
             however, patients previously treated with mTOR inhibitors will be excluded. Prior&#xD;
             treatment for metastatic disease is not required. Patients must have recovered from&#xD;
             the acute toxicities of prior treatment. Chronic toxicities must have recovered to ≤&#xD;
             grade 1. The minimum interval between prior treatment and first day of dosing on this&#xD;
             trial is as follows: standard cytotoxic agents and radiation therapy, 21 days;&#xD;
             mitomycin and nitrosoureas, 6 weeks; hormonal and immunotherapy agents, 2 weeks; minor&#xD;
             surgery, 2 weeks, major surgery, 3 weeks; investigational agents 4-weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age &gt;18 years. Because no dosing or adverse event data are currently available on the&#xD;
             use of everolimus in combination with imatinib in patients &lt;18 years of age, children&#xD;
             are excluded from this study, but will be eligible for future pediatric phase 1&#xD;
             combination trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  ECOG performance status &lt; 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Life expectancy of greater than 3 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have organ and marrow function as defined below:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Leukocytes &gt;3,000/μL; Absolute neutrophil count &gt;1,500/ μL; platelets &gt;100,000/ μL;&#xD;
             Hemoglobin ≥ 9.0 gm/dL (may be transfused to this level); PT/PTT &lt; 1.5x upper limit of&#xD;
             normal; Total bilirubin ≤ 2.0 mg/dL;AST(SGOT)/ALT(SGPT) &lt;3X institutional upper limit&#xD;
             of normal; Creatinine ≤ 2.0 mg/dL or creatinine clearance &gt;50 mL/min/1.73m2&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The effects of everolimus and imatinib on the developing human fetus are unknown. For&#xD;
             this reason, women of child-bearing potential and men must agree to use adequate&#xD;
             contraception (barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry, for&#xD;
             the duration of study participation and 3 months after stopping study drug. Should a&#xD;
             woman (or the partner of a man participating in this trial) become pregnant or suspect&#xD;
             she is pregnant while participating in this study, she should inform her treating&#xD;
             physician immediately.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients may not be receiving any other investigational agents. Patients may not have&#xD;
             received prior treatment for their cancer with an mTOR inhibitor.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with known brain metastases or leptomeningeal disease are excluded from this&#xD;
             clinical trial because of their poor prognosis and because they often develop&#xD;
             progressive neurologic dysfunction that would confound the evaluation of neurologic&#xD;
             and other adverse events. Patients with previously treated brain metastases, who no&#xD;
             longer require steroids, and have no evidence of progression for at least 8 weeks&#xD;
             following treatment of known brain metastases, are eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Baseline diastolic blood pressure &gt; 95 mmHg. Blood pressure medications may be used to&#xD;
             bring the diastolic pressure to levels acceptable for protocol enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active&#xD;
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, ventricular&#xD;
             cardiac arrhythmia, myocardial infarction within the previous 6 months, dyspnea at&#xD;
             rest, active GI bleeding or ulcer disease, diabetes mellitus, or psychiatric&#xD;
             illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because everolimus and imatinib are agents&#xD;
             with the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Because there is an&#xD;
             unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to&#xD;
             treatment of the mother with everolimus and imatinib, breastfeeding should be&#xD;
             discontinued if the mother is treated on this protocol. These potential risks may also&#xD;
             apply to other agents used in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Known HIV-positive patients, because of the potential for pharmacokinetic interactions&#xD;
             with everolimus and imatinib, and because the potential immunosuppressive actions of&#xD;
             everolimus may increase progression or infectious complications of HIV. Appropriate&#xD;
             studies will be undertaken in HIV-positive patients when indicated.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients receiving warfarin (see section 5.2), or chronic treatment with steroids or&#xD;
             another immunosuppressive agent. In addition, patients requiring the following agents&#xD;
             are excluded from the study, and must not take the agents while on the trial:&#xD;
             ketoconazole, itraconazole, erythromycin, clarithromycin, dexamethasone, phenytoin,&#xD;
             carbamazepine, rifampin, Phenobarbital, St. John's Wort, simvastatin, other HMG-CoA&#xD;
             reductase inhibitors (if metabolized by CYP3A4), cyclosporine, pimozide,&#xD;
             triazolo-benzodiazepines, dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers, and acetaminophen&#xD;
             or acetaminophen containing products such as Percoset or Vicodin. Patients taking&#xD;
             CYP3A4 interacting agents with narrow therapeutic windows will be excluded from the&#xD;
             trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient is &lt; 5 years free of another primary malignancy except: if the other primary&#xD;
             malignancy is not currently clinically significant nor requiring active intervention,&#xD;
             or if other primary malignancy is a basal cell skin cancer or a cervical carcinoma in&#xD;
             situ. Existence of any other malignant disease is not a allowed.&#xD;
