&#xD;
          -  For subjects of reproductive potential (males and females), use of a reliable means of&#xD;
             contraception throughout their study participation&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Discontinuation or withdrawal from Study U2970g or failure to complete the Week 52&#xD;
             visit&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  In the investigator's opinion, lack of any clinical improvement by Week 52 in Study&#xD;
             U2970g and for whom the proposed therapy would represent risk without benefit&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Current thrombocytopenia or at high risk for developing clinically significant&#xD;
             bleeding or organ dysfunction requiring therapies such as plasmapheresis or acute&#xD;

             poorly controlled chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or asthma, cardiovascular&#xD;
             disease, accelerated hypertension, major depression) that in the investigator's&#xD;
             opinion would preclude subject participation&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Known active infection of any kind (excluding fungal infection of nail beds), any&#xD;
             major episode of infection requiring hospitalization, or treatment with IV antibiotics&#xD;
