      The purpose of this study is to assess prospectively the efficacy of hydroxyurea therapy in&#xD;
      the setting of cerebrovascular disease, manifest as conditional or abnormal transcranial&#xD;
      doppler ultrasonography (TCD) flow velocities, in children with sickle cell anemia (SCA). TCD&#xD;
      is used to measure flow velocity in intracranial arteries as a marker of increased stroke&#xD;
      risk in children with SCA. The primary objective of this protocol is to determine whether&#xD;
      hydroxyurea reduces elevated TCD velocity.&#xD;

      The purpose of this study is to assess prospectively the efficacy of hydroxyurea therapy in&#xD;
      the setting of cerebrovascular disease, manifest as conditional or abnormal transcranial&#xD;
      doppler ultrasonography (TCD) flow velocities, in children with sickle cell anemia (SCA). TCD&#xD;
      is used to measure flow velocity in intracranial arteries as a marker of increased stroke&#xD;
      risk in children with SCA. The primary objective of this protocol is to determine whether&#xD;
      hydroxyurea reduces elevated TCD velocity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The STOP (Stroke Prevention in Sickle Cell Anemia) trial, a multicenter, randomized,&#xD;
      controlled trial for primary stroke demonstrated that monthly blood transfusions, when&#xD;
      compared to observation alone, significantly reduced the risk of primary stroke for children&#xD;
      with SCA whose TCD velocity exceeded 200 cm/sec. Despite the STOP trial's clear results,&#xD;
      there are unresolved issues regarding TCD and stroke risk in children with SCA. First, the&#xD;
      predictive value of an abnormal result is not compelling since less than a third of children&#xD;
      with an abnormal TCD velocity and even fewer with conditional results will ever develop a&#xD;
      clinical stroke. There is also discordance between TCD and MRI results. Only 40% of children&#xD;
      with abnormal TCD velocity will have abnormalities on brain MRI (Wang, et al. J Pediatr&#xD;
      Hematol/Oncol 2000;22(4):335-339, Pegelow, et al. Arch Neurol 2001;58:2017-2021). There are&#xD;
      also well recognized risks of chronic blood transfusions, including iron overload and&#xD;
      alloimmunization, and the necessary duration of transfusion protection for children with&#xD;
      abnormal TCD velocity is unknown. Unfortunately, there are currently no therapeutic options&#xD;
      besides blood transfusions for patients with SCA and an abnormal TCD velocity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Erythrocyte transfusions and hydroxyurea have many similar beneficial effects in patients&#xD;
      with SCA. Transfusions may prevent primary stroke by lowering the % HbS, by increasing the&#xD;
      hematocrit, by improving red cell rheology, by decreasing red cell adhesion, and by lowering&#xD;
      TCD velocity. Hydroxyurea leads to many of the same changes, thus in this protocol, we will&#xD;
      examine whether hydroxyurea, like transfusions, can lower TCD velocity. In our patients with&#xD;
      SCA who have been screened with TCD ultrasonography, we have observed that children who were&#xD;
      screened while receiving hydroxyurea had lower TCD velocity measurements than those who were&#xD;
      not on hydroxyurea. In a small number of patients with TCD velocity measurements before and&#xD;
      after initiation of hydroxyurea for non-neurological reasons, the TCD velocity declined&#xD;
      significantly after achieving full dose hydroxyurea therapy. The changes in TCD velocity were&#xD;
      correlated with changes in hematocrit since hydroxyurea increases blood counts in patients&#xD;
      with SCA. For each % increase in hematocrit, the TCD velocity increased by 6.3 cm/sec. This&#xD;
      was similar to an abstract from the STOP trial, in which TCD flow velocity declined by 7.9&#xD;
      cm/sec for each increase in % hematocrit from transfusions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on this preliminary data, we initiated this prospective, single-institution, pilot&#xD;
      trial to determine whether hydroxyurea therapy lowers TCD flow velocity in children with&#xD;
      sickle cell anemia.&#xD;
