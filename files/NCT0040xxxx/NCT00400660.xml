  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      GSK615915A is being developed as a novel surfactant for use in the formulation of GSK's&#xD;
      future generation of Metered Dose Inhalers (MDIs). A surfactant in a MDI would provide a more&#xD;
      stable drug suspension, this in turn will produce a consistent dose of drug being delivered&#xD;
      with each puff.&#xD;
