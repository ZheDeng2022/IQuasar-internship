  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Heart transplanted patients often develop coronary artery disease and therefore have their&#xD;
      coronary arteries examined with coronary angiography once a year.The purpose of the study is&#xD;
      to validate computer tomography of the coronary arteries against coronary angiography and&#xD;
      intravascular ultrasound in heart transplanted patients. Additionally the association between&#xD;
      different inflammatory markers and the development of CAD specific to heart transplanted&#xD;
      patients will be studied.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Heart transplanted patients (HTx) often develop coronary artery disease (CAD) which is a&#xD;
      major cause of graft failure and death in this group of patients. Therefore, heart&#xD;
      transplanted patients have their coronary arteries examined annually. At present this is&#xD;
      being done with coronary angiography. Recent development of the computed tomography (CT)&#xD;
      technology has made it possible to examine the coronary arteries with CT angiography (CTA),&#xD;
      which is a non-invasive method. The goal of the study is to validate CTA against coronary&#xD;
      angiography.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Coronary artery disease lesions in heart transplanted patients differ from CAD lesions in&#xD;
      native hearts. HTx patients develop diffuse intimal thickening affecting the whole length of&#xD;
      the vessel starting in the periphery. These lesions specific to HTx patients are not depicted&#xD;
      on coronary angiography. The second aim of this study is to compare the accuracy of CTA&#xD;
      depicting such lesions with the gold-standard, intravascular ultrasound.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The third aim of this study is to study the association between different inflammatory&#xD;
      markers and the development of CAD specific to heart transplanted patients.&#xD;
