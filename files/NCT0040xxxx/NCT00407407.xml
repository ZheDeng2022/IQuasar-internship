      The primary purpose of this study is to determine the maximum tolerated dose and&#xD;
      dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) of weekly and every 3-weeks ABI-007 in combination with&#xD;
      carboplatin (area under the curve [AUC]=6) in patients with ovarian cancer, primary&#xD;
      peritoneal cancer, or fallopian tube cancer.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with a histological diagnosis of primary peritoneal carcinoma, fallopian tube&#xD;
             or epithelial ovarian carcinoma (Stage III or IV) with either (optimal less than or&#xD;
             equal to 1 cm) residual disease or suboptimal residual disease following initial&#xD;
             appropriate surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with the following histologically confirmed types of ovarian cancer are&#xD;
             eligible: serous cystadenocarcinoma, mucinous cystadenocarcinoma, clear cell&#xD;
             adenocarcinoma, adenocarcinoma (unspecified), malignant Brenner's tumor, endometrioid&#xD;
             adenocarcinoma, undifferentiated carcinoma, mixed epithelial carcinoma and&#xD;
             transitional cell carcinoma. Patients with extraovarian papillary serous&#xD;
             cystadenocarcinoma are eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who do not have measurable disease may be included and will be assessed for&#xD;
             toxicity and progression-free survival only. Measurable disease is NOT required but&#xD;
             when present will be followed to assess response. For patients to be evaluated for&#xD;
             response of measurable disease, tumor must be greater than or equal to 2.0 cm with&#xD;
             conventional computed tomography (CT) imaging or greater than or equal to 1.0 cm with&#xD;
             spiral CT imaging.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  No prior chemotherapy for ovarian cancer is permitted.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must be entered no more than 12 weeks postoperatively.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  ECOG performance status 0-2.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age greater than or equal to 18 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient has the following blood counts at Baseline:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  ANC greater than or equal to 1.5 x 10^9 cells/L;&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Platelets greater than or equal to 100 x 10^9 cells/L;&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Hemoglobin (Hgb) greater than or equal to 9 g/dL.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient has the following blood chemistry levels at Baseline:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  AST (SGOT), ALT (SGPT) less than or equal to 2.5x upper limit of normal range&#xD;
                  (ULN);&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Total bilirubin less than or equal to ULN;&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Creatinine less than or equal to 1.5 mg/dL.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Peripheral neuropathy Grade 0 or 1 by National Cancer Institute Common Terminology&#xD;
             Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  It is assumed that almost all patients already had bilateral oophorectomy. However, if&#xD;
             a female of childbearing potential, has a negative pregnancy test (within 72 hours of&#xD;
             the first dose of study drug), the patient must agree to use an effective method to&#xD;
             avoid pregnancy for the duration of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have signed an approved informed consent and authorization permitting&#xD;
             the release of personal health information.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have received any prior treatment, other than initial debulking surgery,&#xD;
             for the cancer being treated in this study. Patients may have received adjuvant&#xD;
             chemotherapy for localized breast cancer, if the therapy was completed greater than or&#xD;
             equal to 3 years before registration in this study and if the patient remains free of&#xD;
             recurrent or metastatic disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have received prior radiotherapy to any portion of the abdominal cavity&#xD;
             or pelvis. Prior radiation for localized cancer of the breast, head and neck or skin&#xD;
             is permitted if it was completed greater than or equal to 3 years before registration&#xD;
             in this study and if the patient remains free of recurrent metastatic disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Concurrent immunotherapy or hormonal therapy for ovarian cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Parenchymal brain metastases, unless documented to be clinically and radiographically&#xD;
             stable for at least 6 months after treatment for the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Serious intercurrent medical or psychiatric illness, including serious active&#xD;
             infection (i.e. requiring antibiotics).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with borderline or low malignant potential tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of other malignancy within the last 5 years, which could affect the diagnosis&#xD;
             or assessment of ovarian cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have received an investigational drug within the previous 3 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient is currently enrolled in a different clinical study in which investigational&#xD;
             procedures are performed or investigational therapies are administered. Also, a&#xD;
             patient may not enroll in such clinical trials while participating in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant or nursing women.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with unstable angina or those who have had myocardial infarction within the&#xD;
             past 6 months. Patients with evidence of cardiac conduction abnormalities (e.g.,&#xD;
             bundle branch block, heart block) are eligible if their cardiac status has been stable&#xD;
             for the 6 months prior to study entry.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with prior hypersensitivity to both Taxol and Taxotere.&#xD;
