      This is an open-label, Phase I study of intravitreally administered ranibizumab in 20&#xD;
      subjects with macular edema associated with CRVO. Patients will be evaluated at baseline with&#xD;
      ophthalmic examination, fluorescein angiography, optical coherence tomography, and color&#xD;
      photography. Subjects will receive open-label intravitreal injections of 0.5 mg ranibizumab&#xD;
      administered every 28 ± 2 days for a total of 3 injections. Thereafter they are to be&#xD;
      evaluated every month until month 12. If the patients have signs of increased intraretinal&#xD;
      hemorrhage or a persistence / increase in central macular edema as determined by optical&#xD;
      coherence tomography when compared to their last visit, are eligible for re-injection at that&#xD;
      monthly visit.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ability to provide written informed consent and comply with study assessments for the&#xD;
             full duration of the study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age &gt; 18 years&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Clinical evidence of perfused central retinal vein occlusion. A central retinal vein&#xD;
             occlusion (CRVO) is defined as an eye that has retinal hemorrhages and a dilated&#xD;
             retinal venous system in all 4 quadrants. Other evidence of a CRVO may include&#xD;
             telangiectatic capillary bed and collateral vessels at the optic nerve head. .&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Central macular edema present on clinical examination and OCT testing with a central&#xD;
             point thickness &gt; 250 microns&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Visual acuity score greater than or equal to 34 letters (20/200) and less than or&#xD;
             equal to 73 letters (20/40) by the ETDRS visual acuity protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Media clarity, pupillary dilation and patient cooperation sufficient to allow OCT&#xD;
             testing and retinal photography&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnancy (positive pregnancy test) or known to be pregnant, also premenopausal women&#xD;

             participation in the study (i.e. chronic alcoholism, drug abuse)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient has significant diabetic retinopathy (greater than moderate NPDR) or macular&#xD;
             edema associated with diabetic retinopathy&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Exam or OCT reveals evidence of vitreoretinal interface abnormality that may be&#xD;
             contributing to the macular edema&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Eye that in the investigator has no chance of improvement in visual acuity following&#xD;
             resolution of macular edema (i.e subretinal fibrosis or geographic atrophy)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any other additional ocular diseases which could irreversibly compromise the visual&#xD;
             acuity of the study eye including amblyopia, anterior ischemic optic neuropathy&#xD;
             (AION), age related macular degeneration (AMD), retinal detachment, severe cataracts,&#xD;
             etc.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Evidence of neovascularization of the iris or retina (presence of ischemic CRVO)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of Grid/Focal laser or Panretinal laser in the study eye&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of vitreous surgery in the study eye&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of use of intravitreal, peribulbar, or retrobulbar steroids within six months&#xD;
             of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of Cataract Surgery within 6 months of enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of YAG capsulotomy within 2 months of the surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Visual acuity &lt;20/400 in the fellow eye&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Uncontrolled Glaucoma, pressure &gt;30 despite treatment with glaucoma medications.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Use of Bevacizumab in either eye within the past 30 days&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Use of Pegaptinib sodium in either eye within the past 6 weeks&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Use of Triamcinolone in either eye&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have received any other systemic experimental drug within 12 weeks prior to&#xD;
             enrollment.&#xD;
