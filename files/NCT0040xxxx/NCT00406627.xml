  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to check blood samples for lymphatic filariasis to determine&#xD;
      whether the recent Program to Eliminate Lymphatic Filariasis was successful in controlling&#xD;
      lymphatic filariasis in areas of Egypt. Volunteers will participate in a health assessment&#xD;
      program carried out by Ain Shams University and approved by the Egyptian Ministry of Health&#xD;
      and Population. This program includes a brief interview and laboratory tests to detect worm&#xD;
      parasites in participants' blood. Volunteers and family members found to have worms in their&#xD;
      blood will be referred for treatment. This study will provide early detection of this&#xD;
      parasitic infection and referral for prompt treatment in order to prevent spread of the&#xD;
      infection to others. Approximately 23,500 people, 6 years of age and older, will participate&#xD;
      per year. Study participants will include people living in areas of Egypt that are known to&#xD;
      have the filariasis parasite. Volunteers will participate for up to 2 years.&#xD;

      The purpose of this study is to detect lymphatic filariasis in blood samples to determine&#xD;
      whether the recently concluded Program to Eliminate Lymphatic Filariasis has been successful&#xD;
      in controlling lymphatic filariasis (LF) in areas of Egypt. The Research and Training Center&#xD;
      on Vectors of Diseases (RTC) at Ain Shams University in Cairo, Egypt, will be the central&#xD;
      site for data management and laboratory studies. Field sites (localities for village and&#xD;
      school surveys) are 44 villages and small towns in 27 Districts and 7 governorates in the&#xD;
      Nile river delta and in Giza. These localities are chosen based on inclusion in the Egyptian&#xD;
      National Program to Eliminate Lymphatic Filariasis (PELF). Other localities will be chosen&#xD;
      because of proximity to known endemic localities or a past history of filariasis endemicity.&#xD;
      The primary study objective is to conduct population-based field studies to address key&#xD;
      questions faced during late stages of programs for elimination of lymphatic filariasis (ELF).&#xD;
      The investigators will test the hypothesis that filariasis has been eliminated in Egypt by 5&#xD;
      rounds of Mass Drug Administration (MDA) and attempt to answer the following questions: (1)&#xD;
      Has LF been eliminated in localities included in the Egyptian National ELF Program? The&#xD;
      investigators will study 44 localities (22 per year in alternate years). (2) What&#xD;
      characteristics in endemic communities affect the likelihood of success or failure for ELF&#xD;
      programs? The goal here is to identify key characteristics shared by localities that achieved&#xD;
      elimination. (3) Are there significant foci of infection in localities that were not included&#xD;
      in the Egyptian National PELF? The investigators will screen 20 new localities per year for&#xD;
      the first 3 years of the project. The investigators will conduct a cohort study of the&#xD;
      natural history of filarial antigenemia in treated populations. This study will test two&#xD;
      hypotheses: (a) Filarial antigenemia without microfilaremia following completion of a MDA&#xD;
      program with diethylcarbamazine and albendazole is of very little parasitological&#xD;
      significance. That is to say, these people are unlikely to develop levels of microfilaremia&#xD;
      that support filariasis transmission. (b) Following completion of a MDA program, filarial&#xD;
      antigen levels in amicrofilaremic subjects will decline over time and disappear without&#xD;
      further treatment. The investigators will assess the value of advanced diagnostic methods for&#xD;
      detecting foci of continued transmission and for early detection of resurgent transmission.&#xD;
      The duration of this study is 5 years, and approximately 23,500 people will participate per&#xD;
      year. Most participants will be studied only once in cross-sectional surveys. The study&#xD;
      population will include females and males over 6 years of age who live in areas of Egypt that&#xD;
      are known to have been endemic or are now suspected to be endemic for bancroftian filariasis.&#xD;
      Subject selection will not be based on health status. A subset of people, approximately 120,&#xD;
      will be followed in a cohort study for 2 years.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Gender, minority and child inclusion: Males and females will be included in&#xD;
        population-based village studies without regard to race or ethnic group. There is no reason&#xD;
        to exclude pregnant women from population-based studies. There is no reason to exclude&#xD;
        children from the village/town studies, and they are included. Younger children will be&#xD;
        studied in the school surveys (with large numbers per locality) because they are important&#xD;
        sentinels for ongoing filariasis transmission.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Eligibility for the cohort study: Subjects in household surveys with positive&#xD;
        immunochromotography test, filarial antigen tests, and negative microfilaria thick blood&#xD;
        smears and who took diethylcarbamazine and albendazole during the Egyptian Program to&#xD;
        Eliminate Lymphatic Filariasis will be invited to participate in the study. Subjects must&#xD;
        be residents of localities that have met the Basic Elimination criterion (community&#xD;
        microfilaria prevalence by thick smear less than 1% or antigen prevalence rate less than&#xD;
        2%). Consenting subjects will be screened further by testing a sample of venous blood&#xD;
        collected after 9 p.m. for microfilaremia by membrane filtration and by performing an ELISA&#xD;
        to quantitate filarial antigenemia in serum. Eligible subjects will have no microfilaremia&#xD;
        by smear and antigen levels &gt; 20 ng/ml.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion of children less than 10 years of age from community studies of filarial antigen&#xD;
        and microfilaria prevalence is justified because prevalence rates for these parameters are&#xD;
        exceedingly low in young children in low transmission areas like Egypt.&#xD;
