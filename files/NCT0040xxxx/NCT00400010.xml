    <textblock>
      In a randomized controlled trial, patients recruited in a general hospital and fulfilling&#xD;
      criteria for alcohol dependence, alcohol abuse or at-risk drinking will be randomly allocated&#xD;
      to two conditions:(1) Transtheoretical Model (TTM)-based expert system group, patients&#xD;
      receive an individualized feedback on drinking norms, health-related risks and core&#xD;
      constructs of the TTM, augmented by a TTM-based manual, (2) Control group,receiving a booklet&#xD;
      on health behavior.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome assessment will be conducted after 12 months. The hypothesis is that individualized&#xD;
      feedback leads to greater reduction in alcohol consumption and elevated readiness to change&#xD;
      at follow-up.&#xD;

      Background: A promising approach in secondary prevention of problem drinking is to provide&#xD;
      brief interventions in medical settings. However, brief interventions have not become&#xD;
      implemented in general practices (GPs) due to insufficient role security and therapeutic&#xD;
      commitment of physicians. Computerized expert systems can provide very cost-effective means&#xD;
      of intervention and have been effective in the field of smoking cessation. However, in the&#xD;
      alcohol field, research on this issue is scarce.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives: Comparing an expert system based on the Transtheoretical Model of behavior change&#xD;
      for patients with at-risk drinking, alcohol abuse or alcohol dependence to a control&#xD;
      condition. Methods: About 2,500 screenings among consecutive general hospital patients aged&#xD;
      18 to 64 will be conducted. Subjects fulfilling inclusion criteria (severe alcohol dependence&#xD;
      excluded) will be randomly assigned to one of two conditions with 150 patients each: (1) In&#xD;
      the TTM-based expert system group, patients receive an individualized feedback on drinking&#xD;
      norms, health-related risks and core constructs of the TTM, augmented by a TTM-based manual.&#xD;
      (2) In the control group, participants receive a booklet on health behavior. Outcome&#xD;
      assessment will be conducted after 12 months. Outcome variables are alcohol consumption,&#xD;
      stages of change progress and utilization of formal help. Expected impact: Findings are&#xD;
      expected to provide evidence for a computerized TTM based expert system to be used in primary&#xD;
      care. This would be the first international results confirming such an approach in the&#xD;
      alcohol field. If a TTM-based expert system would be effective, this could significantly save&#xD;
      resources and enhance secondary prevention. Therefore, data are of great public health&#xD;
      interest. Relationship to the objective of the collaboration: As in the other studies,&#xD;
      empirical data on new proactive approaches to reach underserved populations in the addiction&#xD;
      field will be provided. The project will add knowledge on the economical use of&#xD;
      interventions.&#xD;
