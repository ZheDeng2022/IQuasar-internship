  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main treatment option for Treatment Resistant Depression is electroconvulsive therapy&#xD;
      (ECT) which is often effective but complicated by cognitive side effects, need for&#xD;
      anaesthesia and considerable stigma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In recent years considerable efforts have been made to increase public awareness about&#xD;
      depression and increase access to services. However, the increasing number of patients&#xD;
      accessing treatment for depression in clinical services is also likely to be accompanied by a&#xD;
      sizeable increase in the number of patients with TRD. Despite the demand, relatively few&#xD;
      treatment options are available to such patients. One of the only substantially new&#xD;
      treatments developed for TRD in recent years has been the advent of repetitive transcranial&#xD;
      magnetic stimulation (rTMS). Repetitive TMS has been evaluated in over 20 trials conducted&#xD;
      over the last 10 years. Previous research indicates that rTMS has antidepressant activity;&#xD;
      however, the proportion of patients who respond to rTMS and the degree of treatment response&#xD;
      demonstrated in trials to date is limited. The limitations of these studies include&#xD;
      relatively small samples and limited duration of treatment (i.e., 2 weeks) as well as a lack&#xD;
      of long term follow-up. As rTMS is gradually entering use in routine clinical practice (for&#xD;
      example, recent regulation of its use in Canada), research is urgently required to establish&#xD;
      ways to enhance treatment response both in regards to the extent of response within&#xD;
      individuals and the proportion of individuals in whom rTMS has effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stimulation site is another important treatment factor; thus far almost all of the trials of&#xD;
      rTMS in TRD conducted have evaluated the utility of high frequency left prefrontal cortex&#xD;
      (PFC) rTMS (HFL-TMS). In addition, several studies have evaluated the treatment efficacy of&#xD;
      low frequency rTMS to right PFC (LFR-TMS). In a previously published study we have&#xD;
      demonstrated that these two approaches have similar therapeutic benefit and both were&#xD;
      superior to sham stimulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A promising new approach to enhance efficacy involves combining LFR-TMS and HFL-TMS in a&#xD;
      sequential manner. We describe this as sequential bilateral rTMS (SB-rTMS). We have recently&#xD;
      published the results of the first substantial evaluation of SB-rTMS showing not only a&#xD;
      superiority to placebo in TRD but also a therapeutic response that is substantially superior&#xD;
      to response rates in most of the published studies of unilateral rTMS (&gt;50% of patients&#xD;
      achieving standard criteria for clinical response compared to usually &lt;30% in most studies).&#xD;
      In this proposed research study, we will directly test the hypothesis that SB-rTMS produces a&#xD;
      greater therapeutic response than HFL-TMS and compare both of these forms of stimulation to&#xD;
      placebo (i.e., sham) stimulation.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Justification for project&#xD;
&#xD;
      TRD is clearly a major health issue - depression is common, results in marked morbidity and&#xD;
      mortality and a large percentage of patients do not respond to, or cannot tolerate standard&#xD;
      treatment. The development of new treatments for this condition is undoubtedly required.&#xD;
      International efforts are underway to try and establish the efficacy of HFL-TMS to the point&#xD;
      where the technique may be approved by regulatory authorities and clinically introduced.&#xD;
      However, clearly the response rate to HFL-TMS is suboptimal for its widespread use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The overall goal of this research program is to develop rTMS methods to the point at which&#xD;
      they are highly relevant and applicable to clinical practice. None of the substantial&#xD;
      international studies is focusing on novel applications such as SBrTMS. As an outcome, we&#xD;
      expect positive results to change the focus of rTMS application and practice nationally and&#xD;
      internationally. If we can follow our well received initial study of this technique with a&#xD;
      substantial comparative trail as planned here, it will provide enough evidence for the more&#xD;
      widespread adoption and testing of SBrTMS as a viable alternative to HFL-TMS. Ultimately,&#xD;
      this or a modification of it, may become the rTMS administration method of choice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additionally, we will have a sufficient sample size to start to explore meaningful predictors&#xD;
      of clinical response including biological, psychosocial/personality variable predictors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypotheses / Research Questions&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Hypothesis&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Hypothesis 1: Treatment with left sided and SBrTMS will both result in a greater&#xD;
           reduction in HAMD and MADRS scores than sham rTMS.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Hypothesis 2: Treatment with SBrTMS will result in a greater reduction in HAMD and MADRS&#xD;
           scores than left sided rTMS applied alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Hypotheses&#xD;
&#xD;
      â€¢ Greater than 50% of treatment responders to rTMS will continue to experience clinical&#xD;
      benefits from rTMS, as indexed by persistently low HAMD and MADRS scores, at 6 months post&#xD;
      acute treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology including project design and sequence of procedures&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experimental Design&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will involve a 2 phases of treatment: an acute treatment phase of 3-9 weeks&#xD;
      duration and a maintenance treatment phase, lasting 52 weeks. In the initial 3 weeks of the&#xD;
      acute treatment phase the study will be randomised, double blind and sham-controlled with&#xD;
      three arms:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. SBrTMS&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Unilateral left rTMS&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Sham rTMS&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior to randomization, participants will undergo an EEG and MRI (see below for more detail).&#xD;
      The EEG and MRI will be repeated once during the active treatment phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization will occur via the generation of a single computer number sequence. Subjects&#xD;
      will be randomised immediately prior to the commencement of the first treatment session,&#xD;
      after the measurement of bilateral resting motor thresholds with standard means [30].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Acute treatment will be administered daily, 5 days per week initially for three weeks (i.e.&#xD;
      15 treatments). Following 3 weeks of treatment response will be assessed and the blind&#xD;
      broken. At this point non responders (i.e. HAM-D score &gt; 10) who have been receiving active&#xD;
      treatment will be offered an additional 3 weeks of treatment at the same treatment&#xD;
      parameters. Responders who have been receiving active treatment will enter the maintenance&#xD;
      phase. At week 6 treatment response will again be assessed and non responders will be offered&#xD;
      a final 3 weeks of active treatment while responders will enter the maintenance phase. At&#xD;
      week 9 response will again be assessed and non responders will cease their participation in&#xD;
      the trial, while responders will continue onto the maintenance phase. With regard to the sham&#xD;
      treatment arm, subjects who respond to treatment and received sham treatment will be&#xD;
      discontinued from the study at week 3. Those subjects who are classified as non responders&#xD;
      and were in the sham treatment arm will be randomised to one of the two active treatment arms&#xD;
      and receive an additional 3 weeks of active treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The maintenance phase will be open labeled and consist of weekly treatments at the same&#xD;
      parameters to which patients initially responded, for a total of 8 weeks. Maintenance&#xD;
      treatment will then be further reduced to fortnightly treatments for 44 weeks. Patients will&#xD;
      be evaluated clinically every 2 weeks. Should patients relapse (i.e. a HAM-D score of &gt;15 for&#xD;
      2 consecutive weeks), they will be offered active treatment only (i.e. no sham treatment) for&#xD;
      up to six weeks at the same stimulus parameters to which they previously experienced a&#xD;
      response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion Criteria: Patients will be included if they:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Have a DSM-IV diagnosis of a major depressive episode (SCID 11).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Aged 18-85.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Have treatment resistant depression at Stage II of the Thase and Rush classification&#xD;
           [31]; .e. have failed to achieve a clinical response, or did not tolerate, at least two&#xD;
           separate antidepressant trials of sufficient dose for at least 6 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Have a Hamilton Depression Rating Scale Score of &gt; 20 (moderate - severe depression).&#xD;
           Including only a severely ill group of subjects limits the placebo response rate [32].&#xD;
           Moreover, this will allow us to address the application of rTMS methods in the most&#xD;
           clinically relevant subgroup of patients (in addition helping to constrain group&#xD;
           heterogeneity, a major issue in depression research).&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Have had no increase or initiation of new antidepressant (or other psychoactive) therapy&#xD;
           in the 4 weeks prior to screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additional Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Patients who have an unstable medical condition, neurological disorder or any history of&#xD;
           a seizure disorder or are currently pregnant or lactating.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. In the opinion of the investigator, are a sufficient suicidal risk to require immediate&#xD;
           electro-convulsive therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Have a current DSM IV diagnosis of substance abuse or dependence disorder, a diagnosis&#xD;
           of a personality disorder (SCID II) or another axis 1 disorder.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Please note: several of these criteria (e.g. inclusion criteria 1 &amp; 2, exclusion criteria 3)&#xD;
      have been selected to explicitly constrain the heterogeneity of the sample to increase the&#xD;
      likely power of the study to detect differences between the groups given the potentially&#xD;
      subtle difference between the treatment methods.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample Size Calculations We aim to recruit 40 patients into each group (total n=120). The&#xD;
      sample size calculation for the study was conducted based on the within group standard&#xD;
      deviation of 12.9 (this was the standard deviation for baseline to final study visit in our&#xD;
      SBrTMS study) and between group difference of 5.0 points. With an alpha of 0.05 the study&#xD;
      will have a power of 0.87 to detect a difference in end scores between the 3 groups&#xD;
      (calculation in PASS 8.0).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical Measures Demographic variables and potential co-variates will be recorded at&#xD;
      baseline following a clinical interview. These will include the duration of the current&#xD;
      episode, years from first diagnosis, number of previous episodes, type and dose of current&#xD;
      and previous treatment and family history of mood disorder.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical measures will be performed at randomization, at 3 and 6 weeks (and 9 weeks in the&#xD;
      patients in the extension phase) as well as at the follow up assessments. A trained rater who&#xD;
      is blind to treatment type will administer all measures. Raters will be required to maintain&#xD;
      &gt;90% reliability on the primary outcome assessments on ratings with 6 monthly assessments&#xD;
      based on videotaped interviews.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To ensure comparability with previous studies, the primary outcome variable will be the&#xD;
      17-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAMD). Other outcome measures will include the&#xD;
      Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS), Beck Depression Questionnaire (BDI), Brief&#xD;
      Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) and an interview to record the subjective experiences of TMS&#xD;
      and any adverse events. Final response and remission rates will be measured using standard&#xD;
      rating scale score criteria but the patients will need to achieve these scores at the study&#xD;
      end and at the 2 week follow up assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessments made at baseline to explore potential predictors of clinical response will&#xD;
      include the CORE rating of melancholia [33], the Measure of Parental Styles [34], the&#xD;
      Depressive Personality Inventory [35] and the Costello and Comrey trait anxiety measure [36].&#xD;
&#xD;
      A battery of cognitive tests will be administered prior to commencement and at 3, 6 and 9&#xD;
      weeks in the active treatment phase with a specific focus on attention and memory:&#xD;
&#xD;
      HVLT, Controlled oral word association, Trail making A&amp;B, Digit Span The inclusion of these&#xD;
      measures in the will assess the potential beneficial effects of TMS on frontally mediated&#xD;
      cognitive functions as well as act as a safety check.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TMS Treatment TMS will be administered with a Medtronic Magpro30 magnetic stimulator using a&#xD;
      70mm figure of 8 coil. Prior to the commencement of treatment TMS, single pulse TMS will be&#xD;
      used to measure the resting motor thresholds (RMT) for the abductor pollicis brevis (APB)&#xD;
      bilaterally in all subjects using standard published methods [30].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stimulation parameters rTMS will be administered on a daily basis 5 days per week for all&#xD;
      subjects:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bilateral:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Left: 10Hz, 100% RMT, 30 Trains, 5 second duration, 25 second inter-train interval Right: 1&#xD;
      Hz, 100% RMT, 1 Train of 600 pulses&#xD;
&#xD;
      Left Unilateral:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Left: 10Hz, 100% RMT, 30 Trains, 5 second duration, 25 second inter-train interval Right: as&#xD;
      above, BUT, applied with a Medtronic sham coil Sham: the following applied with a sham coil&#xD;
      Left: 10Hz, 100% RMT, 30 Trains, 5 second duration, 25 second inter-train interval Right: 1&#xD;
      Hz, 100% RMT, 1 Train of 600 pulses Missed sessions will be 'made up' by an extension of the&#xD;
      treatment duration but only one missed session will be allowed weekly and only one missed&#xD;
      session in a row.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stimulation localisation This will follow standard procedures. Firstly, the site for the&#xD;
      optimal activation of the abductor pollicis brevis muscle in the contralateral hand will be&#xD;
      located whilst stimulating the relevant motor cortical region at supra-threshold intensity.&#xD;
      This site will be marked on the scalp. We will then measure 6 cm anteriorly on the scalp&#xD;
      surface and mark it with ink. This point will be then used as the site of stimulation. The&#xD;
      majority of rTMS studies have measured 5 cm anteriorly. However, this has been shown to&#xD;
      result consistently in localisation that is posterior to the dorsolateral PFC [37]. The&#xD;
      measurement described here should result in more consistent treatment of dorsolateral PFC but&#xD;
      still provide considerable stimulation overlap with the established '5 cm' site.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Imaging MRI imaging will be conducted before the commencement of treatment (all subjects) and&#xD;
      at the end of the active treatment phase where possible. Each subject will undergo a 3D&#xD;
      sagittally orientated T1 weighted structural MR scan on the 1.5 Tesla MRI scanner at the&#xD;
      Alfred (128 slices). Analysis of scalp to cortex distance in prefrontal cortex and at the&#xD;
      site of stimulation will be conducted using previously published methods. This will allow the&#xD;
      post hoc analysis of the relationship between scalp to cortex distance and treatment&#xD;
      response. In addition, where possible subjects will undergo additional measures of white&#xD;
      matter tract integrity (diffusion tensor imaging) and activation. None of the scanning&#xD;
      procedures will involve the administration of contrast.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Electroencephalography (EEG) EEG before and after the acute phase of treatment will be used&#xD;
      to examine mean absolute spectral power within 5 frequency bands. The mean absolute power (in&#xD;
      squared microvolts per hertz) will then be computed within the following 5 frequency bands:&#xD;
      delta (0.5-3.5 Hz), theta (3.5-7.5 Hz); alpha (7.5-12.5 Hz); beta 1 (12.5-20.5 Hz), and beta&#xD;
      2 (20.5-32.5 Hz). EEG activation / spectral power will be assessed at rest (eyes open and&#xD;
      closed) and during cognitive engagement in several tasks.&#xD;
