    <textblock>
      Alefacept is a new anti-psoriatic drug within the group of the so-called biologics. In about&#xD;
      30% of patients alefacept induces a more than 75% improvement of psoriasis after a 12-week&#xD;
      treatment period. The start of anti-psoriatic effect by alefacept is delayed, however&#xD;
      improvement of psoriatic lesions outlasts the end of alefacept treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Narrowband UVB (UVB-311nm) phototherapy is an established anti-psoriatic treatment regimen&#xD;
      with rapid onset of anti-psoriatic efficacy but disease-free intervals after the end of&#xD;
      successful treatment courses may be short.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, in this half-side (left/right side) comparison study we aim to investigate whether&#xD;
      an additional narrowband UVB treatment accelerates and improves the anti-psoriatic treatment&#xD;
      effects of alefacept.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Psoriasis is an inflammatory skin disease that affects an estimated 2% to 3% of the world's&#xD;
      population. There are a wide range of local and systemic clinical treatments and agents for&#xD;
      clearing, or at least reducing the expression of, psoriatic skin lesions. There is a new&#xD;
      generation of antipsoriatic drugs that specifically target T-cell mediated inflammatory&#xD;
      pathways and that are approved for the treatment of moderate to severe psoriasis in the&#xD;
      United States. Alefacept (Amevive) is one of these so-called biologics. Alefacept appears to&#xD;
      have several advantages over other systemic antipsoriatic agents and is very well tolerated&#xD;
      by patients. Weekly administration of alefacept for 12 weeks reduced the psoriasis area and&#xD;
      severity index (PASI) by greater than 75% in 30% of patients. The maximal antipsoriatic&#xD;
      effect, however, apparently occurs after the 12-week course has ended. In vitro studies and&#xD;
      previous case reports suggested that alefacept's antipsoriatic effect may be augmented when&#xD;
      it is administered in combination with UVB. These findings prompted us to conduct a&#xD;
      prospective randomized half-body comparison study, in which we ask whether the clinical&#xD;
      response of psoriatic lesions to alefacept could be improved by combining alefacept with&#xD;
      standard UVB 311nm phototherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Comparison: Psoriatic patients are treated with intravenous alefacept once per week for 12&#xD;
      weeks. One randomized chosen body-half (left or right side) is additionally treated with&#xD;
      narrowband UVB (UVB-311nm) three times per week until complete clearance of psoriatic lesions&#xD;
      at the UV-treated side. PASI is evaluated before, weekly during, and for 3 to 12 months after&#xD;
      alefacept +/- narrowband UVB treatment.&#xD;
