      Objective of the trial is to assess the safety and efficacy of Montelukast in treatment of&#xD;
      Erythema Nodosum leprosum (ENL) reaction in multibacillary leprosy patients either in&#xD;
      combination with prednisolone or alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis is that montelukast will reduce the severity of ENL reaction in Multibacillary&#xD;
      leprosy patients without causing an unacceptably high incidence of adverse effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design is a multicentre hospital-based single-blind prospective trial for leprosy patients&#xD;
      with ENL reaction. prior written consent will be taken from the patients who will undergo the&#xD;
      trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Endpoints are decrease in severity of ENL and absence of new nerve function impairment&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Leprosy is still a common medical problem in many countries including Bangladesh, and&#xD;
      currently there are at least 3500 leprosy patients in this country at risk of ENL reaction,&#xD;
      which is a distressing complication of Multibacillary (MB) leprosy liable to result in&#xD;
      permanent disability if not well treated. The drug of choice is either prednisolone ( which&#xD;
      often causes adverse effects especially with prolonged use) or thalidomide which is not&#xD;
      available in Bangladesh.Clofazimine in high doses is recommended as an alternative but&#xD;
      supplies are difficult to obtain. Hence the need for an alternative drug which could be used&#xD;
      as a steroid sparing agent or an alternative to steroids in ENL reaction. Montelukast is a&#xD;
      leukotriene inhibitor already available on the open market in this country as an&#xD;
      immunomodulator, and a small clinical trial with zafirlukast ( very similar drug) suggested&#xD;
      that drugs in this group may be effective for ENL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a phase two trial to assess the safety and efficacy of montelukast as an alternative&#xD;
      or supplementarry treatment for ENL reaction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible patients presenting to one of the participating hospitals with ENL reaction will be&#xD;
      randomly allocated to one of three groups to receive prednisolone only or prednisolone plus&#xD;
      montelukast or montelukast alone. Any patients who have major contra-indications to steroids&#xD;
      will be put into a separate observational group and receive montelukast only.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Drug regimens are prednisolone starting at 40 mg od nd tapered over 12 weeks. Montelukast&#xD;
      10mg od for 16 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients will be monitored weekly for 8 weeks then monthly for 4 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At least 20 patients will be enrolled in each group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients will be closely observed for adverse effects, and any who deteriorate will&#xD;
      receieve additional steroid according to the protocol. Any who develop new nerve function&#xD;
      impairment will be removed from the trial and given a full course of prednisolone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis will be done on an intention to treat basis and will look for any statistically&#xD;
      significant difference in ENL score at 2 weeks, 12 weeks and 24 weeks, or a difference in the&#xD;
      number of patients who develop new nerve function impairment, as well as the incidence and&#xD;
      severity of any adverse effects in each group.&#xD;
