  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of the study is to evaluate the efficacy of a neuroprotective dietary&#xD;
      supplement in patients suffering from herniated lumbar disc causing nerve root compression.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Herniated lumbar discs exert pressure on nerves in the spine leading to pain, numbness,&#xD;
      tingling and weakness of the leg, sometimes termed &quot;sciatica&quot;. This syndrome affects about&#xD;
      1-2% of the population, usually at the age of 30 to 50 (the prime working years) leading to&#xD;
      significant economic impact.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Injuries of nerves can lead to degeneration of the parent nerve cells, the neurons. Recent&#xD;
      evidence indicates that herniated lumbar disc exerts mechanical pressure on spinal nerve&#xD;
      roots that leads to local ischemia and inflammation resulting in nerve injury (i.e.&#xD;
      neurotrauma). This neurotrauma can lead to degeneration of the corresponding nerve cells&#xD;
      (dorsal root ganglia sensory neurons and spinal cord motoneurons), resulting in persistent&#xD;
      deficits in motor functions, sensation and pain. Enhancing nerve cell survival capabilities&#xD;
      (i.e., neuroprotection), therefore, should prove a novel therapeutic strategy for slowing or&#xD;
      preventing degeneration of neurons resulting from herniated lumbar disc compression. Yet, in&#xD;
      spite of an intensive search, clinically effective and safe neuroprotective therapeutic is&#xD;
      not available.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The active ingredient in the dietary/medical food supplement under study was discovered to be&#xD;
      an efficacious neuroprotective agent. The original findings, confirmed by laboratories&#xD;
      throughout the world, indicate that the active compound is unique as it acts at multiple&#xD;
      molecular targets to exert its robust neuropeotective effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The active ingredient is found in many plant, fish and meet foodstuffs and is being used and&#xD;
      sold as a food supplement and nutraceutical. Its use as a neuroprotective agent is patented&#xD;
      and thus, it constitutes an ideal candidate for neuroprotective treatment in herniated lumbar&#xD;
      disc and other spine skeletal pathologies causing nerve compression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The safety of the dietary supplement under study was clearly demonstrated in a recent&#xD;
      clinical trial. Results of the trial demonstrated improvement in the general health status&#xD;
      and indicated efficacy in alleviating symptoms in participants with herniated lumbar disc and&#xD;
      other spine skeletal pathologies causing nerve root compression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The present study is randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial designed to ascertain&#xD;
      the therapeutic efficacy of the dietary supplement in participants with herniated lumbar disc&#xD;
      causing nerve damage symptoms. The study is being conducted in two medical centers in Israel.&#xD;
      Eighty participants are presently being recruited and are screened under strict inclusion and&#xD;
      exclusion criteria. Eligible individuals are invited to participate after signing a detailed&#xD;
      informed consent prior to beginning of the study. The participants are being assigned&#xD;
      randomly to receive either the dietary ingredient or placebo in a blind fashion whereby&#xD;
      neither the treating physician nor the participant are aware of the type of treatment.&#xD;
