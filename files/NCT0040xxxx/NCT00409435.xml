  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a 3-day study comparing pyridostigmine versus placebo in the treatment of postural&#xD;
      tachycardia syndrome (POTS). The researchers expect pyridostigmine to improve tachycardia and&#xD;
      stabilize blood pressure.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will be done at the outpatient General Clinical Research Center (GCRC) at Charlton&#xD;
      7 and will involve two visits. Visit 1 will take about 3 hours, and Visit 2 will occur 2 days&#xD;
      after Visit 1 and will take about 2 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will be put in one of two groups by chance (as in the flip of a coin). One group will be&#xD;
      taking placebo (an inactive substance), the other group 180 mg pyridostigmine in time release&#xD;
      formulation. Both placebo and pyridostigmine will look identical and will be taken as one&#xD;
      capsule per day for 3 days. Neither you nor the study doctor will know at the time of&#xD;
      treatment whether the treatment being given is active or inactive. However, in case of an&#xD;
      emergency, this information will be available.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For each of the two visits, the following tests and procedures will be performed:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  When you arrive at the GCRC, you will have a general medical and neurological&#xD;
           examination and height and weight measurement.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Questionnaires. You will be asked to answer a series of questions on your autonomic&#xD;
           symptoms (such as rapid heart rate, feeling of tiredness, cold and sweaty hands) at each&#xD;
           of your two visits. The questionnaire you will be given during your first visit should&#xD;
           take approximately 30 minutes to complete. The questionnaire you will be given during&#xD;
           your second visit should take approximately 10 minutes to complete.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Autonomic Reflex Screen. An autonomic reflex screen will be done during each visit. This&#xD;
           consists of the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Quantitative sudomotor axon reflex test (QSART): QSART is a routine clinical test&#xD;
                that evaluates the response of the sweat gland to a drug, acetylcholine. One&#xD;
                capsule is placed on your forearm and three on your leg and foot. The testing is&#xD;
                done by passing a small electrical current, for 5 minutes, to activate the nerves&#xD;
                that supply the sweat glands. You will feel a slight burning sensation.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Cardiovascular recordings: Blood pressure, heart rate, and other cardiovascular&#xD;
                measurements will be studied by placing electrodes on the chest and a finger or&#xD;
                wrist cuff for continuous blood pressure recordings.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Valsalva maneuver: This involves blowing very hard into a bugle (like blowing up a&#xD;
                balloon) for 15 seconds.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Head-up tilt: Following a period of rest (at least 5 minutes), you will be tilted&#xD;
                up to an angle of not more than 80 degrees and recordings will be made for up to 30&#xD;
                minutes. On Visit 1, one hour after you have taken the study medication, this test&#xD;
                will be repeated. This test will be done only once on Visit 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Hormone level measurements: This will be done during each visit. An IV will be&#xD;
                inserted into a vein in your arm from which approximately one teaspoon of blood&#xD;
                will be drawn while you are lying down and one teaspoon after standing up. This&#xD;
                will be repeated only on Visit 1, one hour after the study drug is given. A total&#xD;
                of four teaspoons of blood will be drawn on Visit 1 and 2 teaspoons will be drawn&#xD;
                on Visit 2.&#xD;
