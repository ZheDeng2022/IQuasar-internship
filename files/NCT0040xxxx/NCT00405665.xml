    <textblock>
      The objective of this trial is to determine the safety and effect on pulmonary function of 14&#xD;
      days of inhaled L-arginine versus placebo administered over a period of 14 days in a cohort&#xD;
      of CF patients.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Despite the inflammatory nature of lung disease in CF, nitric oxide (NO) formation as well as&#xD;
      the expression of NOS2 has been found to be decreased in CF airways. While the reasons for&#xD;
      impaired airway NO formation remain incompletely understood, there is evidence that low NO&#xD;
      formation contributes to lung pathophysiology in CF. Constitutive endogenous formation of&#xD;
      Nitric oxide (NO) in airways is thought to play a role in neurotransmission, smooth muscle&#xD;
      relaxation and bronchodilation. Previous animal experiments have shown that the addition of&#xD;
      L-arginine, the precursor of enzymatic NO formation, resulted in a significantly greater&#xD;
      relaxation of tracheas. There is also evidence that a single dose of inhaled L-arginine&#xD;
      improves pulmonary function in CF. In this study we will assess the effect of L-arginine&#xD;
      inhalation on lung function, nitric oxide formation, airway inflammation and bacterial&#xD;
      infection in CF patients.&#xD;

    <description>Group 1 will receive the active treatment followed by the inactive treatment. The active treatment phase will consist of L-arginine 250 mg/ml dispensed in 2.2 ml vials, from which the patient will take 2ml (500mg) and dilute with 3ml of sterile water to give 5ml of a 100mg/ml solution. Dosing in the inactive treatment phase will consist of a placebo of similar osmolarity and appearance will be formulated and dosed in a similar fashion. It will consist of 2.2ml vials of 1110mmol/L hypertonic saline. Again, the patient will take 2ml and dilute with 3ml of sterile water to give a 445mmol/L solution which has similar tonicity (10%) to the L-arginine. Both treatment phases will be administered by inhalation with a PARI eFLOW device.</description>
