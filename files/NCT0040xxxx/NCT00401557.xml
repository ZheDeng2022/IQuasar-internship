  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine how the body defends itself against Leishmania&#xD;
      (Viannia), a parasite that can cause a skin infection and skin sores. Certain cells in the&#xD;
      immune system act more aggressively against Leishmania in people with mild Leishmania&#xD;
      symptoms than in those who have long-term or recurring symptoms of the disease. Participants&#xD;
      in the study will include people who currently have Leishmania infection, people who have had&#xD;
      the infection in the past, and people who have never been exposed to the parasite. This study&#xD;
      will enroll 220 adults, ages 18 to 70 years, at 3 sites in Colombia. Blood samples will be&#xD;
      collected from volunteers at least once during the study. Participants will also undergo HIV&#xD;
      testing. Volunteers will participate in up to 2 study visits, scheduled 2-3 weeks apart.&#xD;

      This is a cross-sectional study that aims to determine the mechanisms that lead to the&#xD;
      distinct in vitro susceptibility of human macrophages to L. Viannia infection, and their&#xD;
      relationship to clinical phenotype. It is the third part of a study which includes DMID&#xD;
      protocols 06-0009 and 06-0010. The general objective of the study is to determine the&#xD;
      mechanisms that lead to the distinct in vitro susceptibility of human macrophages to L.&#xD;
      Viannia infection, and their relationship to clinical phenotype. (Understanding the immune&#xD;
      mechanisms underlying disease should provide insight for the development of new methods for&#xD;
      treatment and intervention.) The specific objectives of the study are: to determine the&#xD;
      association of the Toll response profile of monocytes and macrophages with the in vitro&#xD;
      susceptibility phenotype, and analyze Toll receptor response in relation with both in vitro&#xD;
      and clinical phenotype in participants presenting asymptomatic, chronic and recurrent disease&#xD;
      and in healthy donors (controls)(Toll receptors); to determine gene expression response of&#xD;
      susceptible and resistant macrophages to exposure and infection by L. panamensis, in order to&#xD;
      identify genes and gene products that determine the course of infection in the host cell and&#xD;
      that are linked to clinical response; to define the interaction of cytokines and Leishmania&#xD;
      infection in promoting the latent persistence of infection or activation of growth, and to&#xD;
      explore the role of apoptosis in elimination or propagation of infection (Apoptosis); and to&#xD;
      determine the functional phenotypic characteristics of susceptible and resistant macrophages&#xD;
      from healthy donors and clinically disparate individuals by flow cytometric analyses&#xD;
      (Functional Phenotype of mononuclear phagocytes). Participants of the four specific&#xD;
      objectives will be asked to provide relevant demographic, clinical and epidemiologic&#xD;
      information and blood samples. Monocytes and macrophages differentiated from peripheral blood&#xD;
      samples will be analyzed by different methodologies (flow cytometry, Real time PCR, ELISA and&#xD;
      microarray analysis), and the results compared across the groups in order to determine if the&#xD;
      macrophage response to infection is a determinant of recurrent and/or chronic disease&#xD;
      development. Participants will be enrolled at three sites in Colombia: CIDEIM, Cali; CIDEIM,&#xD;
      San Andr√©s Hospital, Tumaco; and San Juan Bautista Hospital, Chaparral. Patients (males and&#xD;
      females) aged between 18-70 years with historic chronic or recurrent cutaneous leishmaniasis&#xD;
      diagnosed at any of these three study sites will be invited to participate in the study.&#xD;
      Asymptomatic and healthy donors (controls) will also be enrolled. A maximum of 220&#xD;
      participants will be enrolled. For historic (chronic and recurrent) and asymptomatic&#xD;
      participants, a single study visit is planned. For healthy donors, 2 study visits are&#xD;
      planned. The second visit will be programmed 2-3 weeks after the first visit. Study outcome&#xD;
      measures will be levels of transcription of cytokines (e.g. TNF-alpha, IL-10, IL-12) and&#xD;
      nuclear transcription factors normalized to the number of macrophages; percentage of&#xD;
      non-infected and infected macrophages/monocytes expressing specific cytokine receptors and&#xD;
      Toll like receptors; density of receptor expression; percentage of apoptotic cells; number&#xD;
      and change in number of parasites in apoptotic and non-apoptotic cells; nitric oxide level;&#xD;
      cytokine production as concentration of supernatants of macrophage cultures (e.g. TNF-alpha,&#xD;
      IL-10, and IL-12); intracellular cytokine production, intracellular nitric oxide level;&#xD;
      percentage of infected macrophages/monocytes and number of intracellular parasites over time&#xD;
      to assess survival and replication; and percentage of non-infected and infected&#xD;
      macrophages/monocytes expressing specific activation and differentiation markers and the&#xD;
      intensity of marker expression.&#xD;
