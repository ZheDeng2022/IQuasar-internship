  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Postmenopausal women with a history of breast cancer often suffer from climacteric symptoms&#xD;
      such as hot flushes and sweating episodes. Conventional hormone therapy is not allowed in&#xD;
      such patients because there are indications that hormones may cause breast cancer to recur.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tibolone is a steroid with estrogenic, progestogenic and androgenic activity and is&#xD;
      registered for treatment of climacteric complaints. Tibolone has a pharmacologic and clinical&#xD;
      profile that is different from conventional hormones. In contrast to conventional hormones,&#xD;
      tibolone does not increase breast density and causes less breast pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The LIBERATE study is a study in which the safety and efficacy of tibolone has been&#xD;
      investigated in postmenopausal women that have been treated for breast cancer.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A growing proportion of women diagnosed with early stage breast cancer seek help with&#xD;
      vasomotor and sexual complaints. Frequently, these symptoms result from adjuvant cancer&#xD;
      treatment, irrespectively whether this is hormonal (e.g. tamoxifen, aromatase inhibitors),&#xD;
      cytotoxic, or surgical (oophorectomy) in nature. Estrogen-containing hormone therapy is&#xD;
      effective, but considered unsafe. Non-hormonal therapy is less effective. Tibolone, which&#xD;
      does not increase mammographic breast density, has proven to be effective and thus could be&#xD;
      an important treatment option for women persistently seeking help.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this trial is to demonstrate safety, efficacy and tolerability of oral 2.5&#xD;
      mg tibolone daily in breast cancer patients, who, after surgery, have no evidence of disease&#xD;
      and who suffer from climacteric complaints. Primary study endpoint is breast cancer&#xD;
      recurrence, including primary contralateral breast cancer. Secondary outcome variables&#xD;
      include menopausal symptoms, bone mineral density and health-related quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients were eligible for this study when they had been surgically treated within the&#xD;
      previous 5 years for histologically confirmed T1-3, N0-2, M0 breast cancer and had to have&#xD;
      vasomotor symptoms, with a last menstruation at least 12 months before (or bilateral&#xD;
      oophorectomy).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The LIBERATE Trial has been designed to show non-inferiority of tibolone compared to placebo.&#xD;
      Adequate sample size was estimated to be at least 1500 subjects in each arm, assuming a&#xD;
      breast cancer recurrence rate of 5% per year in the first 3 years and an dropout rate of 5%&#xD;
      per year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The LIBERATE Study has successfully included the appropriate number of women with the proper&#xD;
      risk profile so that significant results can be obtained in relation to safety and efficacy&#xD;
      of tibolone in breast cancer patients with menopausal complaints.&#xD;
