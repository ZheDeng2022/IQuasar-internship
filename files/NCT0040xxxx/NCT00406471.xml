  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The RAVE (Rubeosis Anit-VEgf) trial, utilizes monthly intravitreal Ranibizumab (Lucentis)&#xD;
      injections for 9 months to see if total VEGF blockade will prevent neovascular glaucoma and&#xD;
      eliminate the need for panretinal photocoagulation in patients with ischemic central retinal&#xD;
      vein occlusion.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The most devastating complication of ischemic CRVO is the development of anterior segment&#xD;
      neovascularization and the resulting morbidity from neovascular glaucoma. This complication&#xD;
      appears to be directly correlated with intraocular VEGF levels. Currently there is no proven&#xD;
      treatment to decrease the formation of rubeosis. Current management of the disease consists&#xD;
      of pan-retinal photocoagulation once significant anterior segment neovascularization becomes&#xD;
      manifest. This treatment destroys peripheral retina (with peripheral retinal field) and&#xD;
      presumably works by eventually lowering ocular VEGF levels which causes secondary regression&#xD;
      of rubeosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As ranibizumab blocks VEGF, this treatment when delivered intraocularly may prevent&#xD;
      neo-vascular glaucoma while preserving peripheral visual fields in this patient population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Risks of intravitreal injections are well known and include endophthalmitis and retinal&#xD;
      detachment. This risk should be less than 1% with proper injection technique and experienced&#xD;
      retinal surgeons. As the incidence of neovascular glaucoma (with resultant loss of central&#xD;
      and peripheral visual fields) is approximately 50% in ischemic CRVO, the small risk of&#xD;
      intravitreal injection is warranted if the drug shows efficacy. In a small number of subjects&#xD;
      in previous animal and human trials, intraocular pressure was acutely elevated when the drug&#xD;
      volume was placed intravitreally. An eye with a compromised circulation (such as ischemic&#xD;
      CRVO) may experience less perfusion if this occurred. Previous intravitreal studies of&#xD;
      ranibizumab have not utilized anterior chamber paracentesis to compensate for the volume of&#xD;
      intravitreal drug to be placed. This was reasonable because an eye with a normal retinal&#xD;
      circulation can tolerate relatively high intraocular pressure for a limited time. This&#xD;
      protocol for this study will include anterior chamber paracentesis prior to intravitreal&#xD;
      injection to minimize this potential risk.&#xD;
