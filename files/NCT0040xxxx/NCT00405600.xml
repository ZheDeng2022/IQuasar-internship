  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of spinal fusion is to relieve pain and/or increase stability in painful or unstable&#xD;
      spine joints. A patient may or may not receive rods and screws with the use of bone graft&#xD;
      materials to facilitate bone growth and a fusion thus preventing movement of the bones of the&#xD;
      spine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this research study, bone graft substitute material called Bone Morphogenetic Protein-2&#xD;
      known as BMP-2 Infuse will be used. No hip bone will be used. The surgical procedure will&#xD;
      consist of BMP-2 Infuse with or without the use of rods and screws.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this study we will be using BMP-2 Infuse instead of the iliac crest bone graft for the&#xD;
      spinal fusion. The BMP-2 Infuse has been researched in the only completed clinical trial for&#xD;
      spinal fusions. It has demonstrated equivalence to the iliac crest bone graft with regard to&#xD;
      both fusion rate and clinical outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently, the acceptable standard of care for spinal fusion surgery requires instrumented or&#xD;
      non-instrumented procedure with the use of bone graft materials, to facilitate bone growth,&#xD;
      and a fusion, thus eliminating movement between the inciting vertebrae.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, the surgical procedure will be BMP-2 Infuse with instrumentation or BMP-2&#xD;
      Infuse alone.&#xD;

             duration.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient has clinical and radiologic history of degenerative disc disease or&#xD;
             spondylolisthesis (no greater than grade 1 utilizing Meyerding's classification&#xD;
             (Meyerding HW, 1932)); spinal stenosis for which conservative treatment has failed and&#xD;
             lumbar spinal fusion is indicated.&#xD;
