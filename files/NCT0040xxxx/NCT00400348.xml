        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
               -  epithelial ovarian cancer or&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  primary peritoneal carcinomatosis or&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  fallopian tube cancer. Enrollment of patients with clear cell histology is&#xD;
                  encouraged.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Have measurable disease according to RECIST or detectable disease by 1) CA-125 at&#xD;
             least twice the ULN within 14 days prior to registration for protocol therapy; 2)&#xD;
             Ascites and/or pleural effusion attributed to tumor; 3) solid and/or cystic&#xD;
             abnormalities on radiographic imaging that do not meet RECIST definitions for target&#xD;
             lesions. Radiographic assessments must be obtained within 28 days prior to&#xD;
             registration for protocol therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Be 18 years of age or older at the time of consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Be at least 4 weeks since last anti-cancer treatment, radiation or surgery at the time&#xD;
             of registration for protocol therapy (with the exception of hormonal therapy, where a&#xD;
             1 week wash-out period is sufficient; minor surgeries, such as catheter placement or&#xD;
             removal within 1 week from enrollment are allowed).&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Have failed at least one prior platinum based chemotherapeutic regimen. (Platinum&#xD;
             failure is defined as Platinum-refractory (progression while receiving a&#xD;
             platinum-containing regimen) or platinum-resistant (disease progression within 6&#xD;
             months from completion of platinum-containing regimen).&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Have life expectancy of at least 3 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Have ECOG performance status of 0 or 1 as assessed within 14 days prior to&#xD;
             registration for protocol therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Have near-normal organ function, as evidenced by laboratory data within 14 days prior&#xD;
             to registration for protocol therapy:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase less than 2.5 times upper&#xD;
                  limit of normal (ULN)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Total bilirubin less than 1.5 times ULN&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Alkaline phosphatase less than 2.5 times ULN&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Absolute neutrophil count greater than or equal to 1,500 cells/mm3&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  White blood cell count greater than or equal to 3,000 cells/mm3&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Hemoglobin greater than or equal to 9.0 g/dL&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Platelets greater than 75,000/mm3&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Creatinine levels less than 1.5 times ULN&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Have no evidence of bowel obstruction, malabsorption, or other contraindication to&#xD;
             oral medication.&#xD;

&#xD;
         12. Females of childbearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test within 7 days&#xD;
             prior to being registered for protocol therapy. Subjects are considered not of&#xD;
             childbearing potential if they are surgically sterile (they have undergone a&#xD;
             hysterectomy, bilateral tubal ligation, or bilateral oophorectomy) or they are&#xD;
             postmenopausal.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Be breastfeeding.&#xD;

&#xD;
          3. Have a history of myocardial infarction or angina pectoris or angina equivalent within&#xD;
             6 months prior to registration for protocol therapy (the patient may be on&#xD;
             anti-anginal medications if the symptoms can be entirely controlled), or have&#xD;
             uncontrolled hypertension or congestive heart failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Have participated in any clinical trial involving conventional or investigational&#xD;
             drugs or devices within 4 weeks prior to registration for protocol therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Have had any active cancer in addition to the epithelial ovarian cancer within the&#xD;
             last 5 years, with the exception of:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  superficial skin cancer (basal cell or squamous cell skin carcinoma)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  carcinoma in situ of the cervix&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Stage I endometrial cancer with less than 50% invasion of the myometrium, or&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  other adequately treated Stage I or II cancer in complete remission.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Have an active infection requiring antibiotic treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Be receiving concurrent anticoagulation therapy (low dose coumadin for port-a-cath&#xD;
             maintenance is allowed).&#xD;
&#xD;
