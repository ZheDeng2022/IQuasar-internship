      The pupose of this study is to demonstrate the safety of the Litx™ therapy and confirm the&#xD;
      zone of tumor destruction with escalated light doses following intraoperative treatment of&#xD;
      primary or recurrent glioma.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Light Infusion Technology (Litx™) is a locoregional cancer treatment in which a systemically&#xD;
      administered light-activated drug (LS11) is activated locally by illuminating the diseased&#xD;
      tissue using light-emitting diodes (LEDs) of a specific wavelength. The activated&#xD;
      photosensitizer reacts with endogenous oxygen to yield highly reactive species of oxygen that&#xD;
      cause destruction of cellular structures such as mitochondria, lysosomes and cell walls&#xD;
      leading to irreversible cell damage and tissue death.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Either twenty-four or twelve hours prior to surgery, the patient will receive an intravenous&#xD;
      dose of 1 mg/kg of LS11, given IV by slow push over 3-5 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following craniotomy, patients will undergo intraoperative placement of a single Light&#xD;
      Source, centrally placed within the tumor, under direct visualization prior to tumor&#xD;
      resection. Following placement of the light source (with the depth of the end of the light&#xD;
      bar from the cortical surface to be calculated from the pre-operative MRI and spiral CT scan,&#xD;
      so as to be centralized within the main tumor bulk), light will be delivered following a&#xD;
      predetermined escalation schedule (either 100 J/cm or 200 J/cm) at 20 mW/cm light energy for&#xD;
      a treatment time of 1 hour 24 minutes (100J/cm) or 2 hours 46 minutes (200 J/cm). The Light&#xD;
      Source will then be manually removed and the tumor maximally resected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The resected tumor and marginal tissue will be submitted for pathology to determine depth of&#xD;
      cell death, extent of tumor tissue containing closed vessels, any evidence of vessel closure&#xD;
      or other damage to tissues outside of the projected kill zone.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Have right hand dominance&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Be adults aged &gt;18 years&#xD;
&#xD;

             sociological, geographical or medical conditions which in the Principal Investigator's&#xD;
             opinion could compromise compliance with the objectives and procedures of this&#xD;
             protocol or obscure interpretation of the trial's data are excluded.&#xD;
