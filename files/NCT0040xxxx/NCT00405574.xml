  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, randomized, phase II study of the safety and efficacy of two dose&#xD;
      levels of oral ATN-224 in patients with prostate cancer with a rising serum PSA in the&#xD;
      absence of detectable disease. Patients will be randomized (1:1) after confirmation of&#xD;
      eligibility requirements. The primary endpoint is to determine the proportion of patients who&#xD;
      do not have PSA progression for 24 weeks. PSA progression is defined as at least a 50%&#xD;
      increase in PSA and &gt;5 ng/mL from baseline or post-treatment nadir if lower than baseline,&#xD;
      confirmed by another PSA at least 28 days later.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      ATN-224 is an orally active, small molecule that has been shown in cellular and animal models&#xD;
      to be anti-angiogenic and to have activity against prostate cancer cell lines. ATN-224 has&#xD;
      the potential to affect the progression of prostate cancer by mechanisms that include both&#xD;
      antiangiogenic and antitumor pathways. ATN-224 may change the time to overt metastatic&#xD;
      disease in patients with rising PSA as the only manifestation of disease after treatment with&#xD;
      curative intent and delay the need for hormonal therapies.&#xD;

&#xD;
               -  Doubling time &lt; 12 months after local therapy in patients who have not had any&#xD;

               -  Doubling time &lt; 12 months starting at least 6 months after their last dose of&#xD;

          -  Patients must have a serum testosterone &gt;150 ng/dL at the time of study entry.&#xD;
             Patients may have received previous castrating hormonal therapy or anti-androgens,&#xD;
             provided that the testosterone level is &gt;150 ng/dL at the time of study entry. Prior&#xD;
             chemotherapy is also allowed as long as the requirements for adequate organ and marrow&#xD;
             function are met.&#xD;
&#xD;

             contraception (hormonal and/or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to&#xD;
             study entry and for the duration of study participation through the follow up visit 28&#xD;
