  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this phase 2 study is to determine if difluprednate ophthalmic emulsion is&#xD;
      effective in the treatment of uveitis.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective was to investigate the efficacy and safety of 0.05% difluprednate&#xD;
      ophthalmic emulsion in patients with endogenous anterior uveitis and to determine its&#xD;
      clinical usefulness for treatment of this disease in the early phase of development, in&#xD;
      comparison with Rinderon® solution (containing 0.1% betamethasone sodium phosphate) that has&#xD;
      widely been used for treatment of postoperative inflammation, uveitis, etc. as a steroid&#xD;
      ophthalmic solution.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objective was to establish the evaluation system for a dose-finding study.&#xD;
