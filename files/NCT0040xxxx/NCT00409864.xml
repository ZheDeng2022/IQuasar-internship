  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cancer of the gallbladder (CaGB) is one of the most common causes of malignant obstructive&#xD;
      jaundice. Jaundice is the second most common presentation and occurs in 30-60% of patients&#xD;
      with CaGB. It is obstructive in nature and frequently associated with pruritus, which is very&#xD;
      disturbing for the patients. The usual mechanism of obstruction is direct infiltration of the&#xD;
      bile duct by the tumour. Most patients with CaGB with obstructive jaundice are not amenable&#xD;
      to a curative surgical resection and hence effective palliation is the goal of treatment.&#xD;
      Although surgical bypass has been the traditional palliative approach, it is associated with&#xD;
      substantial morbidity and mortality. Non-operative alternatives in the form of percutaneous&#xD;
      and endoscopic drainage are available. A few trials have shown that endoscopic drainage is&#xD;
      better than percutaneous drainage in patients with lower end bile duct obstruction due to&#xD;
      pancreatic and peri-ampullary cancer. However, the scenario is quite different in patients&#xD;
      with upper end of bile duct obstruction as occurs due to CaGB. Endoscopic drainage is&#xD;
      associated with a higher incidence of cholangitis in patients with a block at the upper end&#xD;
      of the bile duct and the success rate varies from 40% to 80%, while percutaneous drainage may&#xD;
      be associated with complications such as biliary leak and bleeding. There has been no&#xD;
      randomized trial comparing endoscopic and percutaneous drainage in patients with malignant&#xD;
      obstruction due to CaGB. The objective of the present study is to carry out a randomized&#xD;
      prospective trial comparing percutaneous and endoscopic biliary drainage in patients with&#xD;
      CaGB with obstructive jaundice and to assess their quality of life.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Hypothesis: Percutaneous biliary stenting is superior to endoscopic stenting in providing&#xD;
      successful biliary drainage by 20% in patients with unresectable malignant hilar block due to&#xD;
      carcinoma of gall bladder.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background: Malignant biliary obstruction at the liver hilum is caused by a heterogeneous&#xD;
      group of tumours that include cholangiocarcinoma, gallbladder cancer (CaGB) and metastatic&#xD;
      cancer. CaGB is the commonest cause of malignant hilar obstruction in India (1). Jaundice is&#xD;
      the second most common presentation and occurs in 30-60% of patients with CaGB (2-5). It is&#xD;
      obstructive in nature and frequently associated with pruritis, which is very disturbing for&#xD;
      the patients. Most patients with CaGB with surgical obstructive jaundice are not amenable to&#xD;
      a curative surgical resection (5) and hence effective palliation is the goal of treatment.&#xD;
      Although surgical bilioenteric bypass has been the traditional palliative approach (6), it is&#xD;
      associated with substantial morbidity and mortality. Non-operative alternatives in the form&#xD;
      of percutaneous and endoscopic drainage are available (7-8). Unilateral drainage of single&#xD;
      liver lobe may be sufficient to palliate the jaundice and, pruritis and improve the quality&#xD;
      of life (9-15). A few trials have shown that endoscopic drainage is better than percutaneous&#xD;
      drainage in patients with lower end bile duct obstruction due to pancreatic and periampullary&#xD;
      cancer. However, the scenario is quite different in patients with hilar malignant&#xD;
      obstruction. Endoscopic drainage is associated with a higher incidence of cholangitis in&#xD;
      patients with a block at the confluence (Bismuth types 2 and 3) and the success rate varies&#xD;
      from 40% to 80%, while percutaneous drainage may be associated with complications such as&#xD;
      biliary leak and bleeding. There has been no randomized trial comparing endoscopic and&#xD;
      percutaneous drainage in patients with malignant hilar obstruction alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: To compare unilateral PTBD and endoscopic stenting in patients with CaGB with&#xD;
      hilar block in terms of Successful drainage and Quality of life Patients and Methods&#xD;
      Consecutive patients with CaGB and jaundice will be enrolled in the study. The diagnosis of&#xD;
      CaGB and biliary obstruction will be established on the basis of an ultrasound of the abdomen&#xD;
      and a dual phase CT scan. Histological and/or cytological confirmation of the malignancy will&#xD;
      be established wherever possible by doing a FNAC/trucut biopsy. Hilar block will be&#xD;
      classified according to the Bismuth Corlette classification based on the preprocedural&#xD;
      investigations (16). Final differentiation between type 2 and 3 blocks will be based on&#xD;
      findings noted during intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria CaGB with hilar block not suitable for curative resection with one or more&#xD;
      of the following criteria: (i) Jaundice with serum bilirubin &gt;10 mg/dl, (ii) Pruritus, (iii)&#xD;
      Cholangitis Exclusion criteria: Poor performance status: Karnofsky index &lt; 60, Type 1 and 4&#xD;
      hilar block, Uncontrolled ascites, Duodenal obstruction, Patients who opted for insertion of&#xD;
      a metallic stent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size calculation: The number of patients to be included was calculated to be 91&#xD;
      patients in each group based on the assumption that percutaneous drainage will be better than&#xD;
      endoscopic drainage by 20 %. The sample size was calculated by the formula for a power of 80%&#xD;
      and alpha error of 0.05.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients will be randomly divided into two groups using random blocks generated by a&#xD;
      computer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group A - percutaneous biliary drainage (PTBD) Group B - Endoscopic stenting (ES)&#xD;
      Pre-procedural preparation(17) Patients will undergo detailed investigations and an informed&#xD;
      consent will be obtained.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The procedure will be performed under conscious sedation (midazolam and pentozocine) with a&#xD;
      liberal infiltration of local anesthetic at the site and the capsule of the liver for PTBD.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. PTBD procedure (17) Either a right or left sided approach will be used for PTBD. Once&#xD;
           entry will be gained to a suitable duct the standard Seldinger technique will be used to&#xD;
           place a guidewire in the biliary system. The tract will be dilated and after crossing&#xD;
           the obstruction with a hydrophilic guidewire, a ring biliary catheter will be placed to&#xD;
           provide internal-external drainage. In a subsequent session, a 10 F, straight plastic&#xD;
           stent (polyurethane) will be placed into the system across the obstruction to provide&#xD;
           internal drainage.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Endoscopic stenting (18) A therapeutic duodenoscope and a standard sphincterotome will&#xD;
           be used for cannulation of the bile duct. A hydrophilic guidewire will be used to cross&#xD;
           the malignant stricture. After the stricture is crossed a guide catheter will be passed&#xD;
           over the guidewire and then a 10 F straight plastic stent will be inserted across the&#xD;
           stricture over the guidewire.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary outcome measures:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Successful drainage: A decrease in bilirubin to less than 75% of the pretreatment value&#xD;
           within 7 days&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Early cholangitis: Occurring within 48 hours to 7 days of the procedure as evidenced by&#xD;
           fever, leukocytosis and worsening LFTs.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Quality of life&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcome measures:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Complications&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Procedure-related and 30-day mortality&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Stent patency time will be defined by time to stent occlusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hematological and biochemical parameters will be assessed at days 2 and 7, 1 month after&#xD;
      stent placement and every 3 months thereafter. Patients will be re-evaluated 7 days, 1 month&#xD;
      after stent placement and 3 months thereafter.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Quality of life will be assessed using the WHO-QOL BREF26 and EORTC QLQ-30 questionnaires&#xD;
      pre-procedure, at 1 month and at 3 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      World Health Organization-QOL BREF-26 (19) This has 26 items, which cover physical,&#xD;
      psychological, social and environmental domains. The daily activity is graded in accordance&#xD;
      with the 5 grade scale of performance status recommended by the WHO. WHO-QOL domain scores&#xD;
      will be calculated using the guidelines given in the WHO-QOL scoring manual. A high score&#xD;
      represents a high level of QOL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EORTC QLQ-30 (20) The EORTC QLQ-30 consists of 30 generally applicable items. It incorporates&#xD;
      a functional scale (items 1-5), a role functioning scale (item 6,7), a general symptom scale&#xD;
      (item 8-19), scales on cognitive (item 20-25), emotional (items 21-24) and social (items&#xD;
      26-27) functioning, financial strain scale (item 28) and global health status scale (item&#xD;
      29,30). Scoring will be done using the EORTC scoring manual.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A high score for a functional scale will represent a high/healthy level of functioning, a&#xD;
      high score for global health status/QOL will represent high QOL but a high score for symptom&#xD;
      scale/item will represent a higher level of symptomatology/ problem.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will be instructed to contact the department, if any symptom suggestive of a&#xD;
      complication appeared. Additional information regarding current status or death will be&#xD;
      obtained by direct contact with the referring physician or the patient by telephone/letter.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis Data will be analyzed according to both the intention-to-treat (ITT) and&#xD;
      per protocol (PP) methods. The baseline characteristics will be expressed in mean (SD). The&#xD;
      Pearson chi -square test and Fischer exact test will be used for comparison of categorical&#xD;
      data as appropriate. The t-test will be used for comparison of continuous variables.&#xD;
      Cumulative survival will be estimated using Kaplan-Meier life table analysis, and the groups&#xD;
      will be compared by log rank chi-square test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The QOL score analysis will be done using Paired 't' test for comparison between baseline and&#xD;
      1 month and baseline and 3 months within the groups. MANOVA will be used to assess the trend&#xD;
      of the scores.&#xD;
