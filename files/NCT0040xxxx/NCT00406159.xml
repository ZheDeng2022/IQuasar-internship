      PURPOSE&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this investigation is to evaluate the cognitive and behavioral effects of&#xD;
      Hyperbaric Oxygenation Therapy in children who present with a diagnosis of autism spectrum&#xD;
      disorder.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HYPOTHESIS&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Hyperbaric Oxygenation Therapy will be safe to use with children with autism.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Hyperbaric Oxygenation Therapy will have a statistically significant effect on the&#xD;
           symptoms of autism.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Hyperbaric Oxygenation Therapy will have a clinically significant observable effect on&#xD;
           the overt symptoms of autism.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. The decreases in the symptoms of autism will correlate positively with the number of&#xD;
           Hyperbaric Oxygenation Therapy sessions.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Treatment gains obtained from Hyperbaric Oxygenation Therapy will be maintained at&#xD;
           follow-up, post 40 treatment sessions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SPECIFIC AIMS&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Provide further evidence for the safety of Hyperbaric Oxygenation Therapy in children&#xD;
           with autism.&#xD;

      Participants &amp; Setting&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants in this study will be 30 consecutive children referred to Thoughtful House for&#xD;
      the treatment of autism or a related developmental disorder. Participants may or may not also&#xD;
      be concurrently receiving intensive behavioral intervention services from the Center for&#xD;
      Autism and Related Disorders. All therapy and behavioral testing sessions will occur on the&#xD;
      premises of Thoughtful House.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following criteria will be considered inclusionary:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Male and female children 2-10 years diagnosed with autism, PDD, or Aspergers&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  No anticipated changes in treatment for the study duration (e.g., diet, nutrients)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  No additional biomedical treatments started 6 weeks prior to enrollment&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
        -  Under the care of a caregiver willing to participate by attending regularly scheduled&#xD;
           appointments and completing the necessary measures&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following criteria will be considered exclusionary:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Current otitis media Sinus infection Asthma Pulmonary cysts Emphysema Upper respiratory&#xD;
      infection Severe claustrophobia, intolerance to being in the chamber History of Seizures&#xD;
      Unstable/uncontrolled disorder of any kind&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design Ten sets of multiple baseline measurement groups, 3 participants each (n=30) will be&#xD;
      used to evaluate the effects of HBOT on the behavioral measures of adaptive (mean length of&#xD;
      utterance, MLU), aberrant, and stereotyped behaviors. The first participant in each multiple&#xD;
      baseline will receive sessions of the behavioral measures for a minimum of one week prior to&#xD;
      the implementation of HBOT. Subsequent participants cannot receive HBOT until an effect is&#xD;
      observed (as determined via visual inspection and statistical analysis of the data) on prior&#xD;
      participants or until prior participants have received 40 HBOT treatments, whatever occurs&#xD;
      first. Subsequent to receiving 40 HBOT treatments, each participant will be given a break&#xD;
      from HBOT for at least one week, during which time the schedule of behavioral measures will&#xD;
      remain the same. If proficiency on the behavioral measures decreases when HBOT is terminated&#xD;
      for one week, HBOT may be reinitiated as per the discretion of the physician and parent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HBOT Systematic Desensitization&#xD;
&#xD;
      Because children with autism often do not tolerate changes in the environment, we anticipate&#xD;
      difficulties with initial treatment compliance in some children. In a clinical setting,&#xD;
      children become acquainted with the mask and machine, and are introduced to an enclosed&#xD;
      oxygen chamber and HBOT begins at a prescribed pressure. Below are the general&#xD;
      desensitization procedures for the participants:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The child is introduced to the mask and therapist models how it is worn&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The child is required to hold the un-strapped mask loosely against his/her face until&#xD;
           he/she can breathe while holding the mask in place for a minute or more&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. The child is required to strap the mask on for a minute, with gradual increase to 30+&#xD;
           minutes&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. The child is seated upright in the chamber with the mask on and the HBOT machine off for&#xD;
           a minute, with a gradual increase to 30+ minutes&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. The child is lying down in the chamber with the mask on and the HBOT machine on at a low&#xD;
           pressure setting for a minute, with gradual increase to 30+ minutes&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. The child has the mask strapped on and lying down, while the HBOT is running for an hour&#xD;
&#xD;
      For some children who exhibit severe noncompliance with the HBOT procedure, relaxation&#xD;
      training and listening to preferred music prior to the HBOT procedure may be used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to minimize the influence of learning and attention from parents/therapists during&#xD;
      HBOT/placebo sessions, all children will be viewing a developmentally-appropriate DVD (e.g.,&#xD;
      Disney movie) during all HBOT sessions to minimize confounding effects that may occur with&#xD;
      other activities. The viewing of DVDs will continue throughout all 80 sessions and during&#xD;
      follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedures Data will be collected according to the following schedule: prior to treatment,&#xD;
      following 5, 15, 25, and 40 HBOT treatments, as well as at post-treatment and 1 and 3-month&#xD;
      follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Behavioral Measures Participants who are receiving intensive behavioral intervention services&#xD;
      during the course of the study will have continuous measures of many aspects of performance&#xD;
      recorded daily, as a part of their behavioral intervention services. Such measures will be&#xD;
      customized to the behavioral education needs of each child, but are likely to include, at a&#xD;
      minimum: 1) measure of adaptive behavior (e.g., language); 2) measure of aberrant behavior&#xD;
      (e.g., tantrums, etc.); and 3) stereotyped behavior. All such continuous measures can be&#xD;
      observed throughout the course of the participant's involvement in the study. However, the&#xD;
      consideration of any particular continuous measure as part of the current study would require&#xD;
      inter-observer agreement data be collected on those measures for a minimum of 25% of the&#xD;
      observed data. That is, a second, independent observer must record data on all behavioral&#xD;
      clinical measures which will be included in the study. Participants who are not receiving&#xD;
      intensive behavioral intervention services will receive only the behavioral measures&#xD;
      described below. Participants who are receiving intensive behavioral intervention services&#xD;
      during the course of the study will receive the measures described below, as well as any of&#xD;
      their clinical behavioral measures for which adequate inter-observer agreement data are&#xD;
      collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Repeated acquisition task&#xD;
&#xD;
      A defining feature of autism is a global impairment in one's ability to learn. Repeated&#xD;
      acquisition tasks are commonly used in drug behavioral pharmacology studies to assess the&#xD;
      effect of a drug on the ability of an individual to learn, that is, the efficiency with which&#xD;
      the individual's behavior is brought under new forms of stimulus control. Repeated&#xD;
      acquisition tasks typically involve the participant learning to respond to a new sequence of&#xD;
      positions during each session. For example, four levers or buttons are presented and the&#xD;
      participant must press the four buttons in a particular sequence in order to earn&#xD;
      reinforcement. However, the correct sequence is different for every session, and typically&#xD;
      one session is conducted daily, so the sequence of responding required to earn reinforcement&#xD;
      is different each day. The performance of the participant can be analyzed in a number of ways&#xD;
      including the percent correct for the entire session, the total number of responses or the&#xD;
      number of errors made until 80% correct responding is reached.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The complexity of the task can be adjusted by varying either or both of two parameters: 1)&#xD;
      the number of response positions present (e.g., number of buttons present), and 2) the number&#xD;
      of responses in the sequence required for reinforcement. For example, ten buttons could be&#xD;
      present but the participant is only required to press one particular button out of the ten in&#xD;
      order to get reinforcement, versus pressing a sequence of ten which involves each button&#xD;
      once, versus having only two buttons present, etc. The standard degree of complexity in&#xD;
      behavioral pharmacology research is having four response options present and requiring the&#xD;
      participant to respond to all four in a particular order to earn reinforcement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Delayed matching to sample&#xD;
&#xD;
      An additional cognitive process that might be of interest when evaluating HBOT is short-term&#xD;
      memory. A common behavioral measure of short-term memory is a delayed matching-to-sample&#xD;
      (DMTS) procedure. In such procedures, a sample stimulus is presented and then removed and a&#xD;
      delay occurs between the removal of the sample stimulus and the presentation of two or more&#xD;
      comparison stimuli. The participant earns reinforcement for choosing the correct comparison&#xD;
      stimulus. The delay between the removal of the sample stimulus and the presentation of the&#xD;
      comparison stimuli can vary from zero to any conceivable duration, but typically does not&#xD;
      exceed 60 seconds.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The relation between the sample stimulus and the correct comparison stimulus can be varied in&#xD;
      order to alter the difficulty of the task. For example, the sample stimulus and the correct&#xD;
      comparison stimulus may be identical, often referred to as &quot;identity matching.&quot; This is the&#xD;
      easiest form of DMTS. Alternatively, the sample stimulus may be related to the correct&#xD;
      comparison stimulus in an abstract dimension. For example, the sample stimulus may be the&#xD;
      written word car and the correct comparison stimulus might be a bicycle, with a gorilla and a&#xD;
      fork as distracters.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sessions can be conducted with a fixed delay or the delay can be systematically increased&#xD;
      during the session in order to identify a threshold at which the participant is no longer&#xD;
      able to respond correctly. For example, on the first trial, the delay may be zero second and&#xD;
      then the delay may be increased by 4 seconds on each subsequent trial, contingent on correct&#xD;
      responsse on the previous trial. The data are then analyzed to determine the longest delay at&#xD;
      which the participant was consistently correct at 80% accuracy. This threshold can be&#xD;
      considered a measure of the participant's short term memory at the time of the session.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Standardized Measures&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to the direct measures of behavior described above, standardized intelligence and&#xD;
      adaptive assessments will be conducted prior to the initiation of HBOT. These will include:&#xD;
&#xD;
      ADI/ADOS WPPSI-III (2-6 years) /WASI (6+ years) Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scale (VABS)&#xD;
      Subjective Questionnaires Aberrant Behavior Checklist Clinical Global Impression ATEC&#xD;
      Selected sections of the APEQ BRIEF Parenting Stress Index Repetitive Behavior Scale A side&#xD;
      effect questionnaire Thoughtful House Caregiver diary&#xD;
&#xD;
      Laboratory &amp; Physiological Measures Full physical exam (weight, height, vital&#xD;
      signs-temperature) Otoscopic examination prior to enrollment in the study&#xD;
&#xD;
      STATISTICAL DESIGN/ANALYSIS&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary measures will consist of changes in the rate and percentage of change from pre&#xD;
      and post HBOT adaptive, aberrant, and stereotyped behaviors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ADVERSE EFFECTS AND MANAGEMENT: the only 2 most commonly encountered adverse reactions are&#xD;
      ear pain and sinus pressure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ear Pain: This can be minimized or ameliorated by working on pressure equalization techniques&#xD;
      across the tympanic membrane. These techniques include:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Yawning Drinking water/juice Val Salva (Plugging nose and mouth, blowing air out the ears)&#xD;
      Jaw thrust and swallowing Bending head to the side and yawning/swallowing. The technician can&#xD;
      slow the rate of pressurization allowing adequate time for pressure equalization to occur&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sinus pressure: this can be ameliorated with slowing down the rate of pressurization and&#xD;
      depressurization. Also, the administration of 0.5% Neosynephrine intranasally and&#xD;
      pseudoephedrine can be used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Should a serious adverse event occur, the form SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENT REPORTING FORM will be&#xD;
      filled out and reported to the IRB office within 5 business days and a written summary of the&#xD;
      circumstances surrounding the adverse reaction be submitted to the IRB for review at the next&#xD;
      scheduled IRB meeting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Minor reactions, such as ear pain or sinus pressure will be managed and documented by the&#xD;
      physician.&#xD;
