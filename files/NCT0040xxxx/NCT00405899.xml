  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to determine whether there is a relationship between&#xD;
      interferon-gamma levels and the incidence of viral respiratory infections in allergic&#xD;
      children treated with allergy immunotherapy as compared to those treated with standard&#xD;
      medical care (nasal steroids, antihistamines) over a 1-year period. The hypotheses to be&#xD;
      tested are 1) interferon-gamma levels will be significantly increased 3, 6, 9 and 12 months&#xD;
      in allergic children treated with allergy immunotherapy as compared to those treated with&#xD;
      standard medical care, 2) the incidence of viral respiratory infections will be reduced at 3,&#xD;
      6, 9 and 12 months in allergic children treated with allergy immunotherapy as compared to&#xD;
      those treated with standard medical care.&#xD;

      This study will consist of five visits. Visit 1 will occur after subjects complete an initial&#xD;
      clinical evaluation for allergy at this site. Subjects will select their treatment (allergy&#xD;
      immunotherapy as compared to standard medical care) prior to enrollment in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 1 will include informed consent, review of inclusion and exclusion criteria and&#xD;
      phlebotomy for the determination of serum interferon-gamma levels. At the end of this visit,&#xD;
      diary cards to capture the frequency of symptoms of viral respiratory infections will be&#xD;
      distributed. Visits 2-5 will occur 3, 6, 9 and 12 months after visit 1 and will include&#xD;
      review/exchange of diary cards, and phlebotomy for determination of serial serum&#xD;
      interferon-gamma levels.&#xD;
