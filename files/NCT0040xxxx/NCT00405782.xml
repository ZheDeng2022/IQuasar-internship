  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is being done to evaluate the impact of moderate-intensity exercise (such as&#xD;
      walking) on quality of life, energy level, endurance and mood in women with metastatic breast&#xD;
      cancer. Studies have shown that women with early stage breast cancer who exercise during&#xD;
      treatment have more energy, less sleep disturbance, less anxiety and depression, and better&#xD;
      strength and endurance than women who do not exercise. These studies have also shown that&#xD;
      women who exercised during treatment for early stage breast cancer did not develop injuries&#xD;
      or increased fatigue from exercising during chemotherapy and radiation treatments. The&#xD;
      investigators are conducting this trial to see if women with metastatic breast cancer&#xD;
      experience similar benefits from exercise as women with earlier breast cancer. The&#xD;
      investigators also wish to determine whether women with advanced disease are able to exercise&#xD;
      safely during their treatment under the supervision of an exercise physiologist.&#xD;

      -  Participants will be randomized to one of two groups. Study participants assigned to&#xD;
           Group A will immediately participate in a 16-week exercise program, and participants&#xD;
           assigned to Group B will wait 16 weeks before taking part in an exercise program.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Before beginning the exercise program (Group A) or waiting period (Group B),&#xD;
           participants will undergo a series of tests to measure exercise capacity, fatigue level&#xD;
           and quality of life. They will be asked to complete a series of questionnaires and meet&#xD;
           with an exercise physiologist and undergo a treadmill test designed to measure physical&#xD;
           fitness in patients with a chronic illness. The participant will complete the&#xD;
           questionnaires again 8 weeks after enrolling in the protocol and will complete one final&#xD;
           set and undergo a second treadmill test after the 16-week study period has ended.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants in Group A will be given a 16-week gym membership, as well as a heart rate&#xD;
           monitor and a pedometer. They will meet with an exercise physiologist, who will design&#xD;
           an exercise program for each participant. Participants will meet with the exercise&#xD;
           physiologist weekly for 4 weeks, then once per month for the duration of the study. The&#xD;
           target exercise goal will be 150 minutes of moderate-intensity exercise each week.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be given an exercise journal to record the minutes of cardiovascular&#xD;
           exercise and steps taken each day. These journals will be reviewed by the exercise&#xD;
           physiologist each week.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants in Group B will be allowed to exercise as much as they wish during the&#xD;
           first 16-weeks of their time on the study, but they will not be given a formal exercise&#xD;
           plan or a gym membership until the completion of the 16-week waiting period. During this&#xD;
           time, they will also complete questionnaires at the time of study entry, 8 weeks after&#xD;
           enrolling, and at the end of 16 weeks. After the 16-week delay period has passed,&#xD;
           participants in Group B will be given a pedometer, heart rate monitor and 16-week gym&#xD;
           membership. They will also meet with an exercise physiologist weekly for one month, and&#xD;
           the exercise physiologist will design an individualized exercise plan for these&#xD;
           participants.&#xD;
