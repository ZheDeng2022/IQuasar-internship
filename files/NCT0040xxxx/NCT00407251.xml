    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the efficacy of patupilone chemotherapy and to find&#xD;
      out what effects (good and bad) the drug Patupilone has on patients with prostate cancer that&#xD;
      has progressed following hormone treatment and docetaxel chemotherapy.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Prostate cancer is the most common cancer diagnosed and the second most common cause of&#xD;
      cancer death in men in North America (Jemal 2003). Many patients with localized disease have&#xD;
      an excellent long-term survival and high cure rates with standard approaches (D'Amico 1998).&#xD;
      However, patients with high risk, locally advanced and metastatic disease have a poor&#xD;
      prognosis, and although hormonal therapy in the form of medical or surgical castration can&#xD;
      induce significant long-term remissions,development of androgen independent disease is&#xD;
      inevitable. Androgen independent (AI) disease, also termed hormone refractory prostate cancer&#xD;
      (HRPC), is clinically detected by a rise in prostate specific antigen (PSA) and worsening of&#xD;
      symptoms. Once patients reach this stage, therapeutic options are limited and prognosis is&#xD;
      poor&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with hormone refractory prostate cancer after docetaxel chemotherapy have limited&#xD;
      treatment options and no treatment has been proven to be efficacious. Because of the&#xD;
      mechanism of action and the activity of anti-microtubule agents and combinations in general&#xD;
      for HRPC, patupilone has potential for therapeutic activity in patients with HRPC that have&#xD;
      progressed after first line docetaxel chemotherapy.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have histological or cytological diagnosis of adenocarcinoma of the&#xD;
             prostate.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have metastatic or locally recurrent disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have documented evidence of PSA progression&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The PSA must be &gt; 5 ng/mL at the time of study entry.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  ECOG performance status of 0, 1 or 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have a life expectancy of at least 12 weeks in the judgment of the&#xD;
             investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Chemotherapy: patients must have received prior docetaxel based chemotherapy (either&#xD;
             as a single agent or in combination). Patients must have evidence of progression while&#xD;
             receiving docetaxel based chemotherapy or within 6 months after the completion of&#xD;
             docetaxel based chemotherapy. Prior adjuvant or neoadjuvant chemotherapy is permitted&#xD;
             provided therapy was completed &gt; 12 months prior to registration. Prior therapy with&#xD;
             mitoxantrone or experimental non-cytotoxic chemotherapy is permitted (e.g. monoclonal&#xD;
             antibodies, vaccine therapy, receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Hormonal Therapy: Prior hormone therapy is permitted. Patients must be hormone&#xD;
             refractory and have been previously and currently treated with androgen ablative&#xD;
             therapy (medical or surgical castration). Therapy with LHRH agonist must continue for&#xD;
             those prostate cancer patients already receiving this treatment at the time of&#xD;
             enrollment. If the patient has discontinued the LHRH agonist, this must be restarted&#xD;
             and the castrate level of testosterone must be present. Patients must have&#xD;
             discontinued any use of non-steroidal antiandrogens (e.g. bicalutamide, nilutamide,&#xD;
             flutamide) at least 6 weeks prior to initiation of protocol therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Radiation: Prior external beam radiation is permitted provided a minimum of 4 weeks&#xD;
             has elapsed between the last dose and enrollment to the trial. Exceptions may be made&#xD;
             for low dose, nonmyelosuppressive radiotherapy after consultation with the principal&#xD;
             investigator. Prior strontium is not permitted. Patients must have had less than 30%&#xD;
             of marrow bearing areas irradiated.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Steroids: Current treatment with steroids are permitted provided the dose is less than&#xD;
             or equivalent to a daily dose of prednisone of 20mg.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Laboratory Requirements - within 7 days prior to enrollment Hematology: absolute&#xD;
             granulocytes ≥ 1.5 x 109/Lplatelets ≥ 100 x 109/Lhemoglobin ≥ 90 g/L Biochemistry:&#xD;
             bilirubin ≤ 1.0 x upper limit of normal serum creatinine ≤ 1.5 x upper limit of normal&#xD;
             AST/ALT ≤ 2.5 x upper limit of normal&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient consent must be obtained according to local Institutional and/or University&#xD;
             Human Experimentation Committee requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must be accessible for treatment and follow-up. Patients registered on this&#xD;
             trial must be treated and followed at the participating centre.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with a history of other invasive cancer, except adequately treated&#xD;
             non-melanoma skin cancer or other solid tumours curatively treated with no evidence of&#xD;
             disease for &gt; 3 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with known brain metastases should be excluded from this clinical trial&#xD;
             because of their poor prognosis and because they often develop progressive neurologic&#xD;
             dysfunction that would confound the evaluation of neurologic and other adverse events.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic&#xD;
             composition to Patupilone or other agents used in the study.&#xD;

             protocol treatment including: myocardial infarction within 6 months prior to study&#xD;
             entry congestive heart failure unstable angina active cardiomyopathy unstable&#xD;
             ventricular arrhythmia uncontrolled hypertension uncontrolled psychotic disorders&#xD;
