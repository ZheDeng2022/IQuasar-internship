  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to examine whether breathing helium-hyperoxia during exercise in&#xD;
      a pulmonary rehabilitation program can improve the exercise tolerance and health related&#xD;
      quality of life of patients with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      It is well accepted that the exercise training as part of a comprehensive pulmonary&#xD;
      rehabilitation program can improve exercise tolerance, functional status and quality of life&#xD;
      in patients with COPD. It is feasible that if patients were able to perform a greater volume&#xD;
      or intensity of exercise during rehabilitation then the outcomes of the program would be&#xD;
      improved. Recent research has demonstrated that breathing a helium-hyperoxic gas mixture can&#xD;
      significantly reduce dynamic hyperinflation and dyspnea during exercise in patients with COPD&#xD;
      and can increase exercise tolerance to a greater extent than breathing room air or a&#xD;
      nitrogen-based hyperoxic gas. If patients with COPD were to breathe a helium-hyperoxic gas&#xD;
      during exercise they should be able to tolerate a greater intensity of exercise while&#xD;
      maintaining similar levels of exertional symptoms to those observed at lower exercise&#xD;
      intensities breathing room air. As a result patients randomized to the helium-hyperoxia&#xD;
      condition should obtain greater improvements in exercise tolerance than those receiving usual&#xD;
      care (i.e. breathing room air)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Comparisons: Standard pulmonary rehabilitation of patients with COPD receiving either usual&#xD;
      care (air breathing) or helium-hyperoxia (40% O2, 60% Helium).&#xD;
