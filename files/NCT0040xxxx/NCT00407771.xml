      -  The purpose of this study is to examine the effects of tirofiban on platelet function&#xD;
           the Ultegra RPFA in diabetic patients undergoing elective coronary angioplasty and&#xD;
           stenting already treated with high loading dose (600mg) clopidogrel.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  About 44 people will be in the study. The study duration is a single hospitalization&#xD;
           period during which the angioplasty will be performed in addition to a 30-day post&#xD;
           hospitalization follow-up period.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients taking part in the study will be assigned by chance into two groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Group 1: patients will be treated with the glycoprotein inhibitor, Tirofiban&#xD;
                (25mcg/kg over 3 min bolus dose and 0.15 mcg/kg/hr for 12-24 hours), started&#xD;
                immediately after insertion of the sheath.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Group 2: patients will be treated with equivalent placebo&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will be loaded with 600 mg clopidogrel at least 4 hours prior to scheduled&#xD;
      intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will have platelet function analyses at baseline and following treatment.&#xD;

      Introduction Diabetes is a major risk factor for coronary artery disease and diabetic&#xD;
      patients are considered CAD equivalent in the absence of CAD1. The presence of CAD and&#xD;
      diabetes makes the patient at a much higher risk for future morbidity and mortality.&#xD;
      Moreover, percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) in diabetics is associated with a higher&#xD;
      risk of major adverse cardiac events (MACE). Several studies have also suggested that the&#xD;
      release of cardiac biomarkers during PCI procedures have an independent predictability of a&#xD;
      worse prognosis in terms of both morbidity and death. Furthermore, previous investigations&#xD;
      suggested that glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors (GPI) should be used routinely in all&#xD;
      diabetics undergoing PCI due to their higher propensity of developing a hyper aggregatory&#xD;
      status during such procedures that puts them at a higher risk of developing myocardial injury&#xD;
      and subsequent cardiac biomarkers release. However, recent investigation suggested that high&#xD;
      dose clopidogrel (600 mg given at least 4 hours prior to intervention) is as protective as&#xD;
      Abciximab in low risk patients undergoing elective PCI 2. Thus, high dose clopidogrel&#xD;
      preloading without GPI has become the standard for low risk patients undergoing elective PCI.&#xD;
      There is limited data in the literature to suggest that routine administration of GPI prior&#xD;
      to PCI in diabetic patients with a high dose preloading with clopidogrel is actually&#xD;
      beneficial. That is why this trial is being undertaken.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experience with the high dosage of tirofiban Several studies performed following the&#xD;
      completion of TARGET strongly suggested that the 10 Âµg/kg bolus dose of tirofiban is&#xD;
      inadequate3. The TARGET dosing regimen of tirofiban inhibited 20 uMADP-mediated platelet&#xD;
      aggregation only by 60-66% from 15-60 minutes after onset of treatment when tested with PPACK&#xD;
      as a sample anticoagulant, and as a result of rapid tissue redistribution yielded a tirofiban&#xD;
      plasma level of 35-40 ng/mL4. Abciximab, as it was dosed in the TARGET trial, produced a&#xD;
      90-95% inhibition of platelet aggregation in this same time period. This difference in extent&#xD;
      of platelet aggregation inhibition was proposed as the reason why more procedure-related&#xD;
      ischemic events occurred among subjects receiving tirofiban in the TARGET trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To date, several published trials have been described using the single high-dose bolus (SHDB)&#xD;
      of tirofiban in various clinical settings. Taken together, more than 600 patients received&#xD;
      the SHDB of tirofiban in these clinical trials without evidence of a greater than expected&#xD;
      increase in the frequency of bleeding events or thrombocytopenia. A variety of clinical,&#xD;
      angiographic, and echocardiographic endpoints all consistently demonstrate that the SHDB of&#xD;
      tirofiban is superior to placebo and appears to be comparable to abciximab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two trials up to now demonstrated that in the same dosing paradigm SHDB of tirofiban achieves&#xD;
      comparable levels of platelet inhibition as does abciximab for patients undergoing PCI4, 5.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The largest experience published by Danzi and colleagues was a 554- patient observational&#xD;
      study comparing the safety and efficacy of SHDB tirofiban in PCI patients to a cohort of PCI&#xD;
      patients who received abciximab6. Patients were enrolled sequentially: the first 280 received&#xD;
      abciximab and the subsequent 274 received HDB tirofiban. The incidence of major bleeding&#xD;
      events or access site bleeding complications for patients treated with SHDB tirofiban was&#xD;
      less than that seen with abciximab. Moreover, the point estimate of the incidence of&#xD;
      in-hospital and 30-day major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) in the SHDB tirofiban group&#xD;
      was actually below that in the abciximab group (5.6% vs. 7.1%; P=0.65). This clinical&#xD;
      experience suggests that SHDB tirofiban, administered at the time of PCI, is safe and can&#xD;
      produce results similar to abciximab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Danzi and colleagues published a second clinical trial comparing echocardiographic,&#xD;
      angiographic and clinical outcomes in 100 patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial&#xD;
      infarction (STEMI) who were treated with SHDB tirofiban versus abciximab7. There was slightly&#xD;
      greater improvement in echocardiographic outcomes in patients treated with HDB tirofiban&#xD;
      compared with abciximab. Angiographic and clinical outcomes were similar for the two groups.&#xD;
      Again, while there was no incidence of major bleeding or severe thrombocytopenia reported for&#xD;
      either treatment group, there were actually less episodes of minor bleeding in patients&#xD;
      treated with SHDB tirofiban compared with abciximab (4% vs. 8%; P = 0.71). In short, this&#xD;
      clinical experience demonstrated that SHDB tirofiban, administered at the time of PCI, was&#xD;
      comparable to abciximab in treating STEMI patients undergoing PCI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A second STEMI manuscript described the study design and demographics of the STRATEGY trial&#xD;
      which evaluated STEMI patients who were randomized to receive either SHDB tirofiban +&#xD;
      sirolimus eluting stent or abciximab + bare metal stent. This study confirmed the findings of&#xD;
      Danzi and co-workers, and also found that the SHBD tirofiban resulted in the same results, as&#xD;
      compared to patients treated with Abciximab, with a trend towards a lower bleeding rate with&#xD;
      the SHBD tirofiban regimen8 The ADVANCE trial evaluated the efficacy and safety of SHDB&#xD;
      tirofiban compared with placebo in treating high-risk patients9. The study enrolled 202&#xD;
      patients with either a single coronary artery occlusion/diabetes, diagnosed NSTEMI, or&#xD;
      multivessel coronary artery disease. This trial demonstrated a statistically significant&#xD;
      decrease in 6-month MACE or bailout GP IIb/IIIa inhibitor use for patients treated with HDB&#xD;
      tirofiban versus placebo (19.8% vs, 34.7%; P=0.01). SHDB tirofiban was shown to significantly&#xD;
      reduce the increase in cardiac markers (both troponin I and CK-MB) associated with ischemic&#xD;
      events. Subgroup analysis showed a statistically significant decrease in lowering the primary&#xD;
      endpoint for diabetic and ACS patients treated with SHDB tirofiban. Finally, there was no&#xD;
      major bleeding, need for red blood cell transfusion, or severe thrombocytopenia, and there&#xD;
      was no significant difference in even minor bleeding rates between SHDB tirofiban-treated&#xD;
      patients and those treated with placebo (4% vs. 1%; P = 0.19).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In summary, these trials represent a significant clinical experience demonstrating the safety&#xD;
      and efficacy of the SHDB of tirofiban administered at the time of PCI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mechanistic/Pharmacological rationale of benefit expected The use of Tirofiban, given at&#xD;
      single high dose bolus, is expected to act on the final common pathway of platelet&#xD;
      activation, thus it will completely bypass the COX-1 mediated signal activation (the&#xD;
      intracellular pathway on which Aspirin-mediated platelet inhibition is based on). The use of&#xD;
      SHDB Tirofiban will result in a dramatic inhibition of platelet activation compared to&#xD;
      patients treated with aspirin and clopidogrel alone, determining a significant and profound&#xD;
      increase in platelet function which is in contrast to the TACTICS dose10.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective of the investigation The Ultegra RPFA is an automated turbidimetric whole blood&#xD;
      assay designed to assess platelet function on the basis of the ability of activated platelets&#xD;
      to bind to fibrinogen12. The Ultegra RPFA is as accurate and precise as conventional&#xD;
      turbidimetric platelet aggregometry13, and a recent study has demonstrated that the&#xD;
      measurements are not operator dependent or influenced by concomitant medications, hematologic&#xD;
      parameters, or demographics14.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objectives of this proposal is to conduct a pilot study examining the platelet function&#xD;
      using the Ultegra RPFA in diabetic patients undergoing elective PCI when treated with&#xD;
      tirofiban and high loading dose (600mg) clopidogrel versus high loading dose clopidogrel&#xD;
      alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additional assays of flow cytometry and platelet monocyte aggregation will be analyzed in a&#xD;
      similar fashion before and after treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline blood samples will also be assessed for lipid profile, Hs-CRP, FBS, renal function,&#xD;
      liver function, CBC and HbA1c.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Null Hypothesis It is expected that tirofiban arm will provide over 90% platelet aggregation&#xD;
      inhibition compared to the Clopidogrel alone arm which will provide a maximum of 50% platelet&#xD;
      aggregation inhibition. Therefore, an expected difference of 40% in platelet inhibition is&#xD;
      anticipated in this pilot trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      End points&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary endpoint:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To investigate the magnitude of platelet aggregation inhibition using SHBD tirofiban with&#xD;
      clopidogrel versus clopidogrel alone before randomization, 10 minutes (t=0) and 8 hours (t=8)&#xD;
      post tirofiban administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Observational point:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The difference of flow cytometry and platelet monocyte aggregation between the two&#xD;
           groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The incidence of troponin T release 12 hours post PCI among the two groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. The difference in mean troponin T between the groups at 12 hours post PCI.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Major adverse cardiac events (MACE) at 24 hours and 30 days post PCI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up All patients screened (independent of their AR status) will be clinically&#xD;
      followed-up for 1 month to evaluate observational point.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design and Procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Type of study This is a randomized, open label, placebo controlled (with bailout tirofiban as&#xD;
      rescue) single center study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Considerations&#xD;
&#xD;
      Number of patients The study enrollment will be stopped as soon as a total of 44 patients&#xD;
      randomized to receive Tirofiban (in addition to Aspirin, Heparin and 600mg Clopidogrel) vs.&#xD;
      Aspirin, Heparin and 600mg clopidogrel alone and who actually undergo PCI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis Two analyses will be performed; the first is based on intention to treat&#xD;
      and the other considering bailout tirofiban administration and will reflect actual treatment.&#xD;
      Since the primary outcomes are related to operator independent analysis of platelet function,&#xD;
      we do not expect bias in the interpretation of final results and conclusions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main Study Flow 44 Diabetic patients referred for elective PCI will be randomized into two&#xD;
      groups. Group 1: patients will be treated with the GPI, Tirofiban (25mcg/kg over 3 min bolus&#xD;
      dose and 0.15 mcg/kg/hr for 12-24 hours), started immediately after insertion of the sheath.&#xD;
      Group 2: patients will be treated with equivalent placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will be loaded with 600 mg clopidogrel at least 4 hours prior to scheduled&#xD;
      intervention.&#xD;
