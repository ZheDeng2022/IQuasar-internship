      This trial is referred to as the &quot;umbrella trial&quot;. The BATTLE program consists of this&#xD;
      umbrella trial plus four phase II protocols into which the umbrella patients are enrolled.&#xD;
      Patients will first enroll in the BATTLE umbrella trial and undergo a tumor biomarker&#xD;
      analysis that will be used to assign them to one of the four phase II studies. All patients&#xD;
      enrolled in one of the phase II BATTLE protocols must be enrolled in this protocol.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This study is the &quot;umbrella&quot; or screening study in a group of 5 studies known as the BATTLE&#xD;
      (Biomarker-integrated Approaches of Targeted Therapy of Lung Cancer Elimination) program. In&#xD;
      order to participate in one of the research studies, you must first agree to take part in&#xD;
      this screening study, which will be used to determine if you are eligible. After&#xD;
      participating in this study, you may be assigned to a study that is using an investigational&#xD;
      drug. The investigational drug(s) to be used in each of the 4 studies are not approved by the&#xD;
      Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for commercial use in this setting; however, the FDA has&#xD;
      permitted its use in these research studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you agree to participate in this screening study, your complete medical history (including&#xD;
      smoking history) will be recorded and you will have a physical exam, including measurement of&#xD;
      vital signs (blood pressure, pulse, temperature, and breathing rate), height, and weight. You&#xD;
      will have blood (about 2 teaspoons) drawn for routine tests. You will also have blood (about&#xD;
      1-2 tablespoons) drawn to check your blood clotting function, thyroid function, and lipid&#xD;
      (fat) levels. You will have a urine test, a performance status evaluation (questions about&#xD;
      your ability to perform everyday activities), and an electrocardiogram (ECG -- a test that&#xD;
      measures the electrical activity of the heart).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Your tumor will be evaluated by chest x-ray and computed tomography (CT) or magnetic&#xD;
      resonance imaging (MRI) scans to evaluate the status of the disease. You will have a brain&#xD;
      MRI. Women who are able to have children must have a negative blood (about 1 teaspoon)&#xD;
      pregnancy test before receiving the study drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A sample of your tumor tissue will be collected for biomarker analysis. If your tumor tissue&#xD;
      cannot be reached, you will not be able to participate in this research study. To collect a&#xD;
      tumor biopsy, you will have either a CT-guided core biopsy, bronchoscopy, or other type of&#xD;
      biopsy (such as subcutaneous, cutaneous, or lymph node). You will be asked to stop taking any&#xD;
      medication that affects blood-clotting (such as aspirin or coumadin) before the biopsy&#xD;
      procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the cutaneous (skin) biopsy, you will be given a local anesthetic by either a spray or&#xD;
      shot to numb your skin. A small cut will be made to remove all or a piece of the affected&#xD;
      skin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the CT-guided core biopsy of the lung, subcutaneous, and/or lymph node biopsy, a tissue&#xD;
      sample is withdrawn from an organ or suspected tumor mass using a very thin needle and a&#xD;
      syringe. The needle is guided while being viewed by the physician on a CT scan. Any site that&#xD;
      can be safely biopsied will be considered for the collection of tissue. Sites not commonly&#xD;
      biopsied include kidneys, adrenal glands, and brain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the bronchoscopy, you will be given drugs to relax, and then a local anesthetic will be&#xD;
      sprayed into your nose and throat to numb those areas. A slim, flexible tube with a light&#xD;
      will be placed through your nose or mouth and into your lungs. A small brush will be fed&#xD;
      through the tube and into your lungs. The brush will gently scrape off a sample of lung&#xD;
      tissue. Tweezers will then be fed through the tube to collect the tissue samples (biopsy). A&#xD;
      small amount of water will be sprayed into your lungs and then suctioned out through the tube&#xD;
      to collect tissue samples and mucous samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the CT-guided core biopsy or bronchoscopy, you should not take any medications by mouth&#xD;
      or have any solid food for at least 6 hours before the procedure. You also should not have&#xD;
      any liquids 2 hours before the procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are eligible to take part in this study, you will be assigned to 1 of the 4 research&#xD;
      studies based on the results of your tumor analysis. You will be asked to read and sign a&#xD;
      separate informed consent to take part in one of the research studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You have the right to leave the study at any time. If you choose to stop participating in&#xD;
      this study, you should contact the study chair and/or research nurse. Your doctor may decide&#xD;
      to take you off this study if your medical condition gets worse and/or you are unable to&#xD;
      comply with study requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an investigational study. Up to 250 patients will take part in this study. All will&#xD;
      be enrolled at M. D. Anderson.&#xD;
