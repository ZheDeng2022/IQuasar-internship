  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of study is to determine if Lucentis combined with imatinib mesylate will help&#xD;
      treatment in patients with newly diagnosed choroidal neovascularization.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label dose escalating study (n=15) to evaluate the safety and tolerability of&#xD;
      the addition of imatinib mesylate to the Lucentis treatment regime over a 6 month period in&#xD;
      patients with newly diagnosed choroidal neovascularization:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  5 patients will be treated with 4 weeks of imatinib mesylate 400mg per day (the lowest&#xD;
           typical starting dose) to be started concurrently with ranibizumab (Lucentis) 0.5mg&#xD;
           intravitreal injection. The patients would be injected at monthly intervals for the&#xD;
           first 3 months followed by treatment on an as needed basis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If imatinib mesylate is safely tolerated for the first 4 weeks, the following set of 5&#xD;
           patients will be treated with 6 weeks of imatinib mesylate 400mg per day to be started&#xD;
           concurrently with Lucentis 0.5mg intravitreal injection. The patients would be injected&#xD;
           at monthly intervals for the first 3 months followed by treatment on an as needed basis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If imatinib mesylate is safely tolerated for the first 6 weeks, the following set of 5&#xD;
           patients will be treated with 8 weeks of imatinib mesylate 400mg per day to be started&#xD;
           concurrently with Lucentis 0.5mg intravitreal injection. The patients would be injected&#xD;
           at monthly intervals for the first 3 months followed by treatment on an as needed basis.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have a BCVA letter score in the study eye between 73-24 (approximately 20/40 to&#xD;
             20/320) using an ETDRS chart&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have a CNV lesion of any type in the study eye with the following characteristics as&#xD;
             determined by fluorescein angiography:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Evidence that CNV extends under the geometric center of the foveal avascular zone.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The area of the CNV must occupy at least 50% of the total lesion.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The lesion must be ≤4000 microns in greatest linear dimension (GLD)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  For occult with no classic CNV, the lesion must have presumed recent disease&#xD;
             progression as assessed by the Investigator and defined as having at least one of the&#xD;
             following criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Blood associated with the lesion at baseline&#xD;
