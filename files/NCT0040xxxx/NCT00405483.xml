      The purpose of this study is to determine if MIS for primary hip replacement surgery&#xD;
      increases the risk of long term aseptic loosening as predicted by implant micromotion&#xD;
      detected by radiostereometric analysis.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Hip replacement is an effective option for treating chronic hip conditions that cause pain&#xD;
      and functional impairment(1). Significant improvements in quality of life, as measured by&#xD;
      both disease specific and generic quality of life measures, have been well documented (2-4).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hip replacement implants are a 'ball in cup' design, and consist of two articulating&#xD;
      components: a femoral head replacement which can consist of a ball attached to a stem that is&#xD;
      inserted into the proximal femur, and an acetabular component, which can be made of different&#xD;
      materials that are inserted into a liner of metal that is inserted into the pelvis. These&#xD;
      components can be attached to the patient's bone using either polymethylmethacrylate - a&#xD;
      polymer more commonly referred to as bone cement - or by roughening the surface of the&#xD;
      implant to allow bone ingrowth. Hip replacements can therefore be broadly classified by the&#xD;
      fixation technique used: cemented, uncemented, or hybrid, consisting of a cemented femoral&#xD;
      component and an uncemented acetabular component. The uncemented design is very commonly used&#xD;
      in younger patients because the quality of bone is better in the patient, the implants have&#xD;
      demonstrated long term survival, and the cementing step is no longer necessary for achieving&#xD;
      long term fixation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The 10 year survival of current uncemented total hip designs approaches 95% (5). The majority&#xD;
      of the 5% that are revised are done so for aseptic (&quot;non-infected&quot;) loosening of the&#xD;
      components. The functional results of revision total hip surgery are poorer than primary hip&#xD;
      replacement surgery (3, 5, 6). There are approximately 20 000 hip replacement performed each&#xD;
      year in Canada (CIHI website); this will result in roughly 1000 revisions over the next 10&#xD;
      years - a great expense, both in terms of health care resources and in patients' loss of&#xD;
      function. Obviously, efforts directed at decreasing revision rates are clinically and&#xD;
      financially worthwhile.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Implant failure due to aseptic loosening is thought to arise from both patient related&#xD;
      factors such as age, sex and diagnosis, and from implant related factors such as design and&#xD;
      materials used (5). Efforts at reducing aseptic loosening by changing implant design and&#xD;
      cement formulation have occasionally resulted in products that perform well in the laboratory&#xD;
      but fail miserably in real life, often after being implanted into large numbers of&#xD;
      patients(7-10). This has led to a call for careful and controlled introduction of new implant&#xD;
      designs using randomized trials and precise radiographic assessment techniques such as&#xD;
      radiostereometric analysis (RSA) to look for early signs of loosening and impending failure&#xD;
      (7, 9, 11).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Minimally Invasive Surgery (MIS) is a new technology in the optimization of healthcare&#xD;
      services. It has been developed to minimize damage to surrounding tissue during arthroplasty.&#xD;
      by reducing the size of the incision. The possible benefit is dramatic reductions in length&#xD;
      of stay (LOS) for total hip replacement (THR) patients (12). However, MIS development has led&#xD;
      to modifications to existing instrumentation, prostheses and technique which may impact&#xD;
      long-term survival of the implant (13). There has been little research investigating the&#xD;
      effects of these changes on long-term patient outcomes following MIS surgery. The use of RSA&#xD;
      will allow for better understanding of the early fixation of the implant and the potential&#xD;
      for early failure due to aseptic loosening.&#xD;
