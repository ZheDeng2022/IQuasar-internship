      The purpose of this study is to perform a prospective evaluation regarding the relationship&#xD;
      between platelets function and cardiovascular events in patients with ESRD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will include 100-200 patients with ESRD, age 18 years or older, treated in the&#xD;
      nephrology division of Assaf Harofeh medical center.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary end points of the study are cardiovascular events including acute myocardial&#xD;
      infarction (defined as symptoms + acute elevation of TnI), need for coronary artery disease&#xD;
      revascularization, or acute cerebrovascular event (TIA or CVA) and mortality. The secondary&#xD;
      end points are any hospitalization due to acute coronary syndrome, active bleeding with the&#xD;
      need for blood transfusion and dialysis access graft thrombosis (time to thrombosis).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood will be taken for complete blood count including platelets count and mean platelets&#xD;
      volume, serum electrolytes, albumin, blood lipids, Kt/V, troponin and two 5 ml aliquots from&#xD;
      each blood collection will be separated and stored at -70co until analyzed for oxidative&#xD;
      stress, homocysteine and highly sensitive CRP will be performed. Five mL of blood will be&#xD;
      sent for platelets function assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the follow up period the correlation between platelets function an cardiovascular&#xD;
      events will be assessed.&#xD;

      Background Platelets play an important role in cardiovascular disease both in the&#xD;
      pathogenesis of atherosclerosis and in the development of acute thrombotic events. Their&#xD;
      importance in coronary disease and in acute coronary syndromes is indirectly confirmed by the&#xD;
      benefit of antiplatelet agents (particularly aspirin, clopidogrel, ticlopidine, and the&#xD;
      glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors) in these disorders. Cardiovascular disease is the single&#xD;
      best predictor of mortality in patients with end-stage renal disease, as it accounts for&#xD;
      almost 50 percent of deaths. Patients with end stage renal disease (ESRD) have an increased&#xD;
      tendency to bleeding due to platelet dysfunction that can be partly corrected by either&#xD;
      hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis in approximately two-thirds of cases. Currently there is&#xD;
      only scant data concerning the relations between platelet function and cardiovascular risk in&#xD;
      patients with ESRD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Platelets, platelet products, and thrombosis play important and proximate causal roles in the&#xD;
      occurrence of acute occlusive vascular events such as MI and ischemic stroke. The disruption&#xD;
      of platelet and fibrin rich atherosclerotic plaques may lead to enhanced platelet deposition,&#xD;
      and ultimately the formation of a thrombus that can precipitate an acute clinical event. The&#xD;
      following observations are compatible with the importance of platelet thrombus formation in&#xD;
      acute ischemic syndromes:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Thrombus formation within a coronary vessel is the acute precipitating event in most&#xD;
           unstable ischemic coronary syndromes, as documented by angiographic and pathologic&#xD;
           studies . Among patients with sudden death due to coronary thrombosis, the thrombi&#xD;
           typically have a layered appearance indicative of episodic growth. Episodic growth may&#xD;
           alternate with intermittent fragmentation of the thrombus, leading to distal&#xD;
           embolization of both thrombus and platelet aggregates and microinfarction.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Increased platelet-derived thromboxane A2 and other prostaglandin metabolites have been&#xD;
           found in patients with acute myocardial infarction and unstable angina, providing&#xD;
           biochemical support for platelet activation as the cause of these events.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients with unstable angina have elevated levels of P-selectin, an integral membrane&#xD;
           protein involved in platelet adhesion. Pulsatile shear stress, as occurs in stenotic&#xD;
           arteries, can cause platelet aggregation via an increased expression of P-selectin.&#xD;
           Hydrodynamic shear stress, resulting from plaque rupture, can activate platelets and&#xD;
           cause both platelet aggregation (via glycoprotein IIb/IIIa and von Willebrand factor)&#xD;
           and platelet-mediated neutrophil aggregation via upregulation of P-selectin. Although&#xD;
           levels of P-selectin decrease during the first month after treatment, levels remain&#xD;
           higher than normal even with therapy with glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors, suggesting&#xD;
           continued platelet activation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Aggregating platelets from patients with acute coronary syndromes produce less nitric&#xD;
           oxide than those from patients with stable or no angina. Why this might occur is not&#xD;
           known, but impaired nitric oxide production can enhance platelet aggregation and&#xD;
           thrombus formation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Another platelet-related factor believed to contribute to cardiovascular thrombosis is the&#xD;
      presence of larger, more reactive platelets in patients with acute ischemic events (19-21).&#xD;
      The increase in platelet size, which is in compensation for a persistent decrease in platelet&#xD;
      count, results from the ongoing consumption of platelets in unstable angina; this is not seen&#xD;
      in an acute myocardial infarction. In addition, platelets from patients with unstable angina,&#xD;
      as determined by studying platelet aggregability ex vivo, are hyperaggregable. These effects&#xD;
      promote thrombus growth, limitation of blood flow, and acute ischemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Except for the important of platelets in occlusive vascular events several studies suggests&#xD;
      that they may also have a role in the evolutionary phase of the atherosclerotic plaque. After&#xD;
      adhesion to exposed subendothelium following endothelial injury they release vasoactive&#xD;
      substances that induce smooth muscle cell migration and proliferation. Platelets may serve as&#xD;
      a lipid source in the development of the fatty streak and can promote foam cell formation&#xD;
      even in the absence of hyperlipidemia. However, currently there is no clear clinical evidence&#xD;
      that platelets contribute to coronary atherosclerosis. In addition, prophylactic therapy with&#xD;
      aspirin has not been clearly shown to decrease the atherosclerotic burden.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ESRD is associated with prolongation of the bleeding time due primarily impaired platelet&#xD;
      function. It is likely that multiple factors are responsible for the platelet dysfunction in&#xD;
      uremia. Three of the factors that may contribute are the retention of uremic toxins, anemia,&#xD;
      and nitric oxide.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Uremic toxins - The importance of circulating toxins is suggested by the often&#xD;
           beneficial effect of acute dialysis on platelet dysfunction, although the bleeding time&#xD;
           is rarely normalized. In addition, raising the BUN to 60 to 120 mg/dL by dietary&#xD;
           manipulation can diminish platelet adhesiveness and prolong the bleeding time in some&#xD;
           normal subjects. Urea alone, however, is probably not the major platelet toxin and there&#xD;
           is no predictable correlation between the BUN and the bleeding time in patients with&#xD;
           renal failure. Other potential toxins include guanidinosuccinic acid, phenolic acid, and&#xD;
           middle molecules (mol wt 500 to 3000 daltons). In vitro studies in which normal&#xD;
           platelets are incubated with uremic serum suggest that a dialyzable factor interferes&#xD;
           with the binding of fibrinogen to the platelet glycoprotein (GP) IIb/IIIa receptor. In&#xD;
           addition, uremic platelets are unable to adequately increase the expression of GP&#xD;
           IIb/IIIa and P-selectin in response to stimulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Anemia - Previously, anemia was a common finding in chronic renal failure. The degree of&#xD;
           anemia appears to correlate relatively closely with the degree of prolongation of the&#xD;
           bleeding time. Furthermore, correction of anemia with blood transfusions or&#xD;
           erythropoietin often improves platelet function. It has been proposed that the rheologic&#xD;
           factors play an important role in the relationship between anemia and platelet&#xD;
           dysfunction. At a hematocrit above 30 percent, the red cells primarily occupy the center&#xD;
           of the vessel, while the platelets are in a skimming layer at the endothelial surface.&#xD;
           This close proximity allows the platelets to adhere and then form a platelet plug when&#xD;
           there is endothelial injury. With anemia, on the other hand, the platelets are more&#xD;
           dispersed, thereby impairing adherence to the endothelium.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Nitric oxide - Nitric oxide (NO; endothelium-derived relaxing factor) is an inhibitor of&#xD;
           platelet aggregation that is produced by endothelial cells and platelets. Studies in&#xD;
           uremic patients have shown that platelet NO synthesis is increased and that uremic&#xD;
           plasma stimulates NO production by cultured endothelial cells. The increase in NO&#xD;
           synthesis may be due to elevated levels of guanidinosuccinic acid, a uremic toxin that&#xD;
           may be a precursor for nitric oxide in this setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although patients with ESRD are at increase risk for cardiovascular disease there are only&#xD;
      scant data concerning the cardioprotective effect of antiplatelets drugs for primary or&#xD;
      secondary prevention in this population. In a retrospective evaluation of patients with ESRD&#xD;
      after acute myocardial infarction, Berger et al. have found that aspirin is underused in this&#xD;
      population (67.0%) and Similar results were found by McCullough et al., . Balanced against&#xD;
      the potential, but unproven benefit of aspirin in patients with ESRD are its potential risks,&#xD;
      including bleeding and a possible acceleration of access thrombosis. The evidence for&#xD;
      accelerate dialysis access graft thrombosis is based on the work of Himmelfarb and&#xD;
      colleagues. In their trial aspirin appeared to increase the relative risk (RR=1.99) of graft&#xD;
      thrombosis. They subsequently demonstrated that, in vitro, aspirin enhanced platelet-derived&#xD;
      growth factor-induced vascular smooth muscle proliferation. Adding clopidogrel to aspirin in&#xD;
      hemodialysis patients was associated with a significantly increased risk of bleeding and&#xD;
      probably would not result in a reduced frequency of graft thrombosis. Although data&#xD;
      concerning aspirin for primary or secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease in ESRD&#xD;
      patients is not sufficient its efficacy is well proven in the general population. Currently,&#xD;
      it seems not ethical to perform a randomized placebo controlled trial to evaluate the&#xD;
      antiplatelet protective effect in these patients. The purpose of this study is to perform a&#xD;
      prospective evaluation regarding the relationship between platelets function and&#xD;
      cardiovascular events in patients with ESRD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods The study will include 100-200 patients with ESRD, age 18 years or older, treated in&#xD;
      the nephrology division of Assaf Harofeh medical center. Patients will be excluded if their&#xD;
      platelets count will be lower then 50,000 cu/mm, if they have known hematologic malignancies,&#xD;
      other solid malignancy with life expectancy of less then 1 year or if they are treated with&#xD;
      Warfarin (Comadin). Patients will sign a written informed consent before their inclusion in&#xD;
      the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary end points of the study are cardiovascular events including acute myocardial&#xD;
      infarction (defined as symptoms + acute elevation of TnI), need for coronary artery disease&#xD;
      revascularization, or acute cerebrovascular event (TIA or CVA) and mortality. The secondary&#xD;
      end points are any hospitalization due to acute coronary syndrome, active bleeding with the&#xD;
      need for blood transfusion and dialysis access graft thrombosis (time to thrombosis).&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the beginning of the study, blood will be taken for complete blood count including&#xD;
      platelets count and mean platelets volume, serum electrolytes, albumin, blood lipids, Kt/V,&#xD;
      troponin and two 5 ml aliquots from each blood collection will be separated and stored at&#xD;
      -70co until analyzed for oxidative stress, homocysteine and highly sensitive CRP will be&#xD;
      performed. Five mL of blood will be sent for platelets function assessment (described below).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The follow up period will be up to 2 years. During the follow up period, treatment with&#xD;
      aspirin or clopidogrel will be given as needed and platelet function will be assessed after&#xD;
      any change in the antiplatelets therapy. Patients who are being treated with aspirin, will&#xD;
      continue to take the medication with no dose change unless they will have acute&#xD;
      cardiovascular event or active bleeding. Patients will be treated with antihypertensive&#xD;
      therapy, erythropoietin, calcium, vitamin D and other medications as needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Platelet Function Tests Cone-and-Platelet Analyzer This technology has been described&#xD;
      elsewhere (40). Briefly, 200 µL of citrated blood was placed in a polystyrene well and&#xD;
      subjected to a shear rate of 1300 sec-1 using a rotating conical disk for 2 minutes. The well&#xD;
      was washed and stained by May-Gruenwald stain. Platelet adhesion was evaluated as the&#xD;
      percentage of total area covered with platelets designated as surface coverage (%) and&#xD;
      aggregation as the mean size of the surface-bound aggregates designated as average size&#xD;
      (µ'm2) by use of an image analysis system (Galai).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aspirin Response Assay 3.6µl Arachidonic Acid and 0.2ml blood will be added into a micro tube&#xD;
      (2ml), (final Arachidonic Acid concentration 0.275 mM). The tube will be rotated on the tube&#xD;
      mixer at 10rpm for 1 minute. 130µl will be placed in a well and tested with the cone and&#xD;
      platelet analyzer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clopidogrel Response Assay 5µl ADP and 0.2ml blood will be added into a micro tube (2ml)&#xD;
      (final ADP concentration 1.25µM). The tube will be rotated on the tube mixer at 10rpm for 1&#xD;
      minute. 130µl will be placed in a well and tested with the cone and platelet analyzer.&#xD;
