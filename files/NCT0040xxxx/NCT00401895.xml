      Clinical Efficacy of Transjugular Intrahepatic Portosystemic Shunt With 8- or 10-mm Covered&#xD;
      Stents in Cirrhotic Patients:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A Randomized Controlled Study&#xD;
&#xD;
      Introduction In the treatment of esophageal varices rebleeding1 and ascites/hydrothorax&#xD;
      refractory to the diuretic therapy2 by transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS),&#xD;
      shunt stenosis (occurring in 30-70% of cases during the first post-procedural year) and the&#xD;
      onset of hepatic encephalopathy (30-55% of cases at one year) represent two major problems.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since the year 2000, a new polytetrafluoroethylene covered stent has highly improved TIPS&#xD;
      patency, thus inducing a remarkable reduction of rebleeding incidence. Some authors, however,&#xD;
      suggest that the maintenance of the shunt patency may involve an increased risk of hepatic&#xD;
      encephalopathy, although the data in the present literature are limited and controversial.&#xD;
      The only randomized controlled study3 available, in fact, reports a lower incidence of&#xD;
      hepatic encephalopathy in those patients treated with covered stents as compared with those&#xD;
      treated with conventional metallic stents. In our preliminary experience,4 instead, a similar&#xD;
      incidence of hepatic encephalopathy was noted in both groups. In addition, in the group of&#xD;
      patients treated by covered stents, a higher number of cases with persistent and intractable&#xD;
      hepatic encephalopathy (requiring shunt reduction) was recorded.5 Post-TIPS hepatic&#xD;
      encephalopathy incidence increases with the decrease of post-procedure portal pressure which&#xD;
      depends on the caliber of the stent used to create the anastomosis. This might suggest the&#xD;
      use of covered stents with a smaller diameter aimed at reducing the risk of hepatic&#xD;
      encephalopathy. Coated stents with different diameters are presently commercially available,&#xD;
      but clinical studies on the assessment of the best stent diameter for a better clinical&#xD;
      efficacy, a reduced number of complications, and an effective portal pressure reduction&#xD;
      (essential in the treatment of those pathologies in which TIPS is indicated) still do not&#xD;
      exist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim of the study The purpose of our study is to compare the clinical efficacy and the&#xD;
      incidence of complications of TIPS created with 8- and 10-mm covered stents in patients with&#xD;
      hepatic cirrhosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods All consecutive cirrhotic patients who have undergone TIPS at our Department for&#xD;
      bleeding of esophagogastric varices refractory to medical or endoscopic treatment or for&#xD;
      ascites/hydrothorax refractory to diuretic therapy will be considered eligible for the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before the TIPS procedure, all the patients will undergo a complete clinical evaluation&#xD;
      (including psychometric tests) to assess their past or present history of hepatic&#xD;
      encephalopathy; their Child-Pugh and MELD scores will be determined; abdominal ultrasounds&#xD;
      and esophagogastroduodenoscopies will be also carried out. The patients will be then&#xD;
      randomized into two groups to undergo TIPS with either 8- or 10-mm covered stents (VIATORRÂ®,&#xD;
      W. L. Gore &amp; Associates Inc., Flagstaff, AZ). The two groups will be followed up according to&#xD;
      the same post-TIPS protocol:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  an outpatient consultation one month post-procedure and every three months thereafter or&#xD;
           when clinically necessary. Each consultation will include a clinical exam, Child-Pugh&#xD;
           and MELD scores determination, and hepatic encephalopathy assessment;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  a post-procedure ultrasound will be carried out at one and four weeks, at three and six&#xD;
           months, and every six months thereafter or in case of bleeding recurrence or ascites;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  a follow-up esophagogastroduodenoscopy will be performed at one week and at one month&#xD;
           following TIPS, and every six months thereafter or when necessary;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  an angiography will be done in presence of shunt dysfunction (bleeding or ascites&#xD;
           recurrence due portal hypertension) or in case of variceal recurrence at risk of&#xD;
           bleeding associated with signs of shunt dysfunction at ultrasound.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following study end-points are defined:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  hepatic encephalopathy incidence: the hepatic encephalopathy grade will be evaluated&#xD;
           according to the modified West Haven Criteria. Those patients presenting grade II&#xD;
           (lethargy, apathy, personality changes, inappropriate behavior, minimal disorientation&#xD;
           for time or place) or higher grades of hepatic encephalopathy episodes will reach the&#xD;
           main study end-point;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  incidence of persistent hepatic encephalopathy: defined as the presence of a continuous&#xD;
           mental state alteration, with episodes of further worsening episodes;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  incidence of recurrent hepatic encephalopathy: defined as the onset of at least three&#xD;
           episodes of open hepatic encephalopathy in a six-month period;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  incidence of variceal rebleeding: defined as the finding, at esophagogastroduodenoscopy,&#xD;
           of ongoing or recent variceal hemorrhage or the finding of blood in the stomach and the&#xD;
           presence of varices as the only potential cause of bleeding;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  shunt dysfunction: defined as the finding of a portosystemic gradient higher than 12 mm&#xD;
           Hg and angiographic evidence of shunt stenosis or occlusion;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  recurrence of ascites: defined as the need of performing at least one evacuation of&#xD;
           ascitic fluid with paracentesis;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  survival: all deaths of any cause will be recorded. All mortalities occurring within a&#xD;
           six-week period from a digestive bleeding episode will be considered as related to the&#xD;
           bleeding itself. All deaths occurring within 30 days post-TIPS placement will be&#xD;
           considered as early mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size The sample size will be calculated on the main study end-point: the incidence of&#xD;
      hepatic encephalopathy. On the basis of previous studies, the post-TIPS incidence of hepatic&#xD;
      encephalopathy is considered to be of 50% at one year. To obtain a clinically significant&#xD;
      (from 50 to 25%) encephalopathy incidence reduction (a = 5% and b= 20%) it will be therefore&#xD;
      necessary to enroll 57 patients per group. Randomization will be by sealed envelopes in&#xD;
      blocks of ten.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis The comparability of the two groups treated with 8- or 10-mm covered&#xD;
      stents will be verified by c2 o Student t-test. The incidence of hepatic encephalopathy (main&#xD;
      study end-point), shunt dysfunction, rebleeding, recurrence of ascites, and mortality&#xD;
      (secondary end-points) will be calculated by Kaplan-Meier method and compared by Log-rank&#xD;
      test. The Number Cruncher Statistical System (NCSS) software will be employed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The rules and guidelines of the &quot;Good Clinical Practice&quot; and all legal requirements on&#xD;
      sensitive data storage and experimental protocols will be followed.&#xD;
