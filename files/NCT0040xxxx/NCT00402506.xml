  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the effect of MC-1 on the combined incidence of&#xD;
      cardiovascular death and nonfatal myocardial infarction (MI) up to and including 30 days&#xD;
      following coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery compared with placebo.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) effectively relieves angina, results in longer&#xD;
      survival, and a better quality of life in specific subgroups of patients with obstructive&#xD;
      coronary artery disease. Due to the high incidence of coronary artery disease worldwide, as&#xD;
      well as the effectiveness of the surgical procedure, CABG surgery makes up one of the top ten&#xD;
      most frequently performed procedures in North America and Europe. In the United States it is&#xD;
      estimated that approximately 467,000 CABG procedures were performed in 2003.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite the benefits of CABG surgery, patients undergoing these procedures may also suffer&#xD;
      serious adverse outcomes including operative mortality, myocardial infarction, unstable&#xD;
      angina, ventricular failure, life-threatening arrhythmia, renal insufficiency, and stroke.&#xD;
      Some of the proposed causes of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality after CABG include&#xD;
      perioperative ischemia, inadequate myocardial protection and reperfusion injury. The impact&#xD;
      of these serious complications is significant. Incidence rates of death and MI following CABG&#xD;
      surgery range from 5% to 12% depending on risk status. Results from large clinical trials&#xD;
      have recently demonstrated the importance of neurologic deficits as a problematic outcome of&#xD;
      CABG. These deficits include memory impairment, psychomotor, visuospatial, attention and&#xD;
      language abilities as measured by neuropsychological testing as well as sensorimotor&#xD;
      abnormalities associated with stroke.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MC-1 is a naturally occurring metabolite of vitamin B6. Evidence from pre-clinical and&#xD;
      clinical studies suggests that MC-1 protects the heart from ischemic damage and&#xD;
      ischemia-reperfusion injury. This trial will assess the cardioprotective effects of MC-1&#xD;
      compared to placebo in patients undergoing high-risk CABG surgery.&#xD;
