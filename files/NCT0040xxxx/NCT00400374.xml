    <textblock>
      This is a phase I study of second primary tumor prevention in early stage (stage I/II)&#xD;
      patients diagnosed with squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will evaluate the effect on cells and clinical response to study medications:&#xD;
      Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR), Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitor Erlotinib (OSI-774,&#xD;
      Tarceva™), and Cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) Inhibitor (Celecoxib). The side effects of the&#xD;
      medications will be assessed, and chemicals in the cells will be evaluated both before and&#xD;
      after medication is administered that may show how the drugs work. This information will help&#xD;
      researchers determine whether additional studies with these drugs should be conducted to&#xD;
      determine if the drugs can help prevent pre-cancerous lesions from becoming cancerous.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SCCHN accounts for 5% of all cancer, and there is an incidence of approximately 37,200 new&#xD;
      cases in the United States per year with 11,000 deaths. The five-year survival rate for&#xD;
      patients with SCCHN in the United States and other developed countries is still poor,&#xD;
      approximately 40%, comparable to the five-year survival rate in the 1970s despite advances in&#xD;
      detection, surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy. Thus, a preventative approach before the&#xD;
      development of invasive cancer or second primary tumors (SPTs) is highly desirable and novel&#xD;
      strategies to reduce cancer incidence in SCCHN and other tobacco-carcinogen related&#xD;
      malignancies are being pursued.&#xD;
