      The purpose of this research is to evaluate how accurately a proposed &quot;Functionality&#xD;
      Assessment Questionnaire&quot; measures the differences between low-functioning and&#xD;
      high-functioning visually challenged individuals who are legally blind.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The specific aim of this research is to establish the scientific validity of an evaluation&#xD;
      assessment tool that will measure the functional level of the visually challenged population.&#xD;
      For this study a quantitative, self-evaluation tool has been designed to assess the&#xD;
      functional skills at performing a variety of activities. It is called the Functional&#xD;
      Assessment Questionnaire. The questionnaire is an innovative approach to measuring the level&#xD;
      of these functional skills. It also includes critical benchmarks of real-world success that&#xD;
      are not considered in assessing functional levels of the visually challenged, but are&#xD;
      measures of evidence-based outcomes. It is a comprehensive measurement tool covering many&#xD;
      areas of daily living, including:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Education Level&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Employment Level&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Income Level&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Personal Living Skills&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Kitchen Skills&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Mobility Level&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Reading/Writing Skills&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. Oral Communication Skills&#xD;
&#xD;
        9. Social Skills&#xD;
&#xD;
       10. Technology Level&#xD;
&#xD;
       11. Financial Management Skills&#xD;
&#xD;
       12. Recreation Skills&#xD;
&#xD;
       13. Organizational Skills&#xD;
&#xD;
       14. Independence Level&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each of these categories include a progressive scale of 10 activities, 1 being the lowest&#xD;
      level of functionality and 10 being the highest level of functionality. Most of the&#xD;
      categories are easily self-evaluated, though some will require one-on-one discussion with the&#xD;
      test administrator. At the completion of the Functional Assessment Questionnaire, a&#xD;
      functionality score, ranging between 14 and 140 is tabulated for each individual.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to maintain scientific integrity of the Functional Assessment Questionnaire, certain&#xD;
      non-identifiable information will be collected on each human subject. This information&#xD;
      includes:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Age&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Sex&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Visual Acuity (BCVA)&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Peripheral Field&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Diagnosed Eye Condition&#xD;
&#xD;
      Comparative statistical analysis will be performed with the Functional Assessment&#xD;
      Questionnaire results and the widely used SF-36 (36-Item Short Form Health Survey Instrument)&#xD;
      and NEI-VFQ-25 with Appendix (National Eye Institute/Visual Function Questionnaire-25)&#xD;
      questionnaires. The goal will be to check which questionnaire is more sensitive and accurate&#xD;
      in measuring functional level outcomes both prior to (low-functioning individuals) and after&#xD;
      (high functioning individuals) vision rehabilitation program participation.&#xD;

        Approximately 30 legally blind individuals. Between 12-15 individuals will be categorized&#xD;
        as poor or low-functioning, and the same number of subjects that are categorized as&#xD;
        high-functioning.&#xD;
&#xD;
        The factors that will establish high-functioning abilities will be outward skills in&#xD;
        adapting to vision loss, such as:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Employment in mainstream job market&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Extensive vision rehabilitation&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Inclusion into mainstream society&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Success in real world&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Demonstrated ability to live independently, shop, cook, clean, pay bills, and move&#xD;
             around safely without assistance.&#xD;
