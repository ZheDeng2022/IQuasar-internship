    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the safety of docetaxel and CNTO 328 when given&#xD;
      together as a treatment. The second goal of this study is to determine if a combination of&#xD;
      docetaxel and CNTO 328 has an effect on prostate cancer.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1 open-label, multicenter, nonrandomized study of the safety and&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics of the combination of CNTO 328 and docetaxel in patients with metastatic&#xD;
      Hormone-Refractory Prostate Cancer (HRPC). Eligible patients must be age &gt;= 18 years, have&#xD;
      histologically or cytologically confirmed adenocarcinoma of the prostate, and have documented&#xD;
      metastatic disease. Prior chemotherapy for metastatic disease is not allowed.The study will&#xD;
      last for approximately 26 months. This study will be conducted in 4 phases: 1. Screening (up&#xD;
      to 4 weeks): understanding and signing an informed consent form, physical/neurological exam,&#xD;
      an ECG, vitals will be checked, urinalysis, a radiologic assessment, routine blood samples,&#xD;
      study blood samples, a circulating tumor cell blood sample, a testosterone level blood&#xD;
      sample, and a prostate specific antigen (PSA) sample. If the results show that the patient&#xD;
      can be a part of the study, the patient will begin the run-in phase. If the results of the&#xD;
      screening show that the patient cannot be part of the study, the patient will not receive&#xD;
      docetaxel as part of this study or CNTO 328.Starting with the first docetaxel infusion, the&#xD;
      patient will be required to take prednisone twice a day, until the end of Cycle 3. After&#xD;
      Cycle 3, the study doctor will decide if and/or when the prednisone taken. Dexamethasone will&#xD;
      be required at 12 hours, 3 hours, and 1 hour before the start of every docetaxel infusion&#xD;
      through Cycle 3. After Cycle 3, the study doctor will decide how the dexamethasone will be&#xD;
      taken. Antiemetics (to prevent nausea and vomiting) are also required. The study doctor will&#xD;
      decide the dose, how often, and how these should take them 2. Run-in Phase (up to 3&#xD;
      weeks):The term run-in phase describes a period of time before the start of the formal study&#xD;
      treatment. During this phase, the patient will receive only one drug, either docetaxel or&#xD;
      CNTO 328 depending on the assigned group. Groups 1A, 2, and 3: The patient will be given&#xD;
      docetaxel 3 weeks before the formal study treatment begins. During the next 2 weeks the&#xD;
      patient will not receive any study drug, but will undergo certain tests and procedures. Group&#xD;
      1B: The patient will be given a CNTO 328 infusion 2 weeks before the formal study treatment&#xD;
      begins. During the next week the patient will not receive any study drug, but will have&#xD;
      certain tests and procedures. 3. Cycles 1 through 17 (14 cycles - up to 46 weeks and with&#xD;
      additional 3 cycles -up to 55 weeks):Cycles 1 through 17 are each planned to be 3 weeks in&#xD;
      length. All treatment groups will receive an infusion of docetaxel on week 1 of every cycle.&#xD;
      The CNTO 328 infusion occurs based on the treatment group to which the patients are assigned.&#xD;
      Group 1A: Patients will receive a 6mg/kg infusion of CNTO 328 every two weeks, starting on&#xD;
      week 1, cycle 1. Group 1B: Patients will receive a 6mg/kg infusion of CNTO 328 every two&#xD;
      weeks, starting two weeks prior to cycle 1.Group 2: Patients will receive a 9 mg/kg infusion&#xD;
      of CNTO 328 every three weeks, starting on week 1, cycle 1. Group 3: Patients will receive a&#xD;
      12mg/kg infusion of CNTO 328 every three weeks, starting on week 1, cycle 1. The overall&#xD;
      amount of CNTO 328 increases with each higher group. Therefore, Group 1A and 1B will be&#xD;
      filled before Group 2, and Group 2 will be filled before Group 3. This allows CNTO 328 to be&#xD;
      tested in a safer manner. The docetaxel dose remains the same for all three groups.Patients&#xD;
      may receive up to 14 cycles of treatment provided there is no evidence of disease&#xD;
      progression, including serum PSA progression, or unacceptable toxicity. However, patients&#xD;
      responding to treatment with at least stable disease (SD) after 14 cycles will be permitted&#xD;
      to receive 3 additional cycles of treatment. In addition to drug therapy, patients will&#xD;
      receive other tests and procedures. Most of the tests required before study medication is&#xD;
      administered and throughout the study would be done normally during any treatment for&#xD;
      prostate cancer. However, these tests and procedures may be done more often. The following&#xD;
      are the tests and procedures: Routine blood tests; Study blood samples; Testosterone level&#xD;
      sample; PSA sample; Circulating Tumor Cell blood sample; Urinalysis; Physical&#xD;
      exam/neurological exam; Vital signs; ECG (electrocardiogram); Radiological tests4. Follow-up:&#xD;
      After patients complete treatment they will have follow-up visits including patients that&#xD;
      discontinue treatment early. The patients will have them 1, 2, 3, and 4 weeks after the final&#xD;
      treatment cycle is completed. The Week 4 visit will be the &quot;End of Study Visit&quot;. There will&#xD;
      be 3 more visits at 12, 18, and 24 weeks after the final treatment cycle. Long-term&#xD;
      Follow-up: No matter when or why the patients leave the study, the study doctor or nurse may&#xD;
      telephone them to ask about their health and/or look at their medical records every 3 months&#xD;
      to check on how they are doing. They will do this for one year after the last infusion of&#xD;
      study drug. Patients will not need to go to the study center or have any tests performed. The&#xD;
      study center will also ask about any treatment the patient received after they completed&#xD;
      their participation in the study . Docetaxel 75 mg/m2 will be given intravenously (into the&#xD;
      vein) once every 3 wks for up to 17 three week cycles. CNTO328 will be administered&#xD;
      intravenously (into the vein) over 2 hours according to one of the following regimens: 6&#xD;
      milligrams of medication per kilogram of body weight (mg/kg) once every 2 wks; 9 mg/kg once&#xD;
      every 3 wks; and 12 mg/kg every 3 wks for up to 17 three week cycles.&#xD;
