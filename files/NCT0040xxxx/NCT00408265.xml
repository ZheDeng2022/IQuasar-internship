      The purpose of this study is to compare the effects of self-help materials for smoking&#xD;
      cessation and self-help materials for smoking cessation plus prize-based contingency&#xD;
      management (CM), in which prize incentives are available for breath and saliva samples that&#xD;
      indicate smoking abstinence, in substance abuse treatment patients who want to quit smoking.&#xD;

      The specific aims of this study are: (1) to examine the efficacy of self-help materials&#xD;
      compared to self-help materials plus prize contingency management (CM) for smoking abstinence&#xD;
      in substance abuse treatment patients and (2) examine the effects of smoking abstinence on&#xD;
      substance use and substance treatment retention. To address these specific aims, cigarette&#xD;
      smokers entering treatment for alcohol, cocaine or heroin abuse or dependence, who report&#xD;
      daily smoking (at least one cigarette per day) for the past year, and who meet other&#xD;
      inclusion and exclusion criteria, are randomly assigned to receive self-help materials or&#xD;
      self-help materials plus CM. Individuals in the CM group have the opportunity to win prizes,&#xD;
      worth on average $1, $20, or $100, when they meet smoking abstinence criteria (CO &lt; 8ppm and&#xD;
      salivary cotinine &lt; 10ng/mL). Participants meet with research staff 4 times/week during Weeks&#xD;
      1-4, 2 times/week during Weeks 5-8 and 1 time/week during Weeks 9-12. Follow-up interviews&#xD;
      are scheduled 1, 3 and 6 months following the smoking quit date.&#xD;
