    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether outpatient therapeutic management guided by&#xD;
      impedance cardiography (ICG), in addition to standard clinical assessment, will result in a&#xD;
      longer time in days to the first heart failure hospitalization than therapy guided by&#xD;
      clinical assessment alone.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The course of patients with chronic heart failure is marked by periodic episodes of clinical&#xD;
      decompensation that not only impair the quality of life and may be fatal but also consume&#xD;
      substantial health care resources, primarily due to the costs of hospitalization. Heart&#xD;
      failure management programs have been developed to reduce the frequency and severity of these&#xD;
      clinical events, but their effectiveness may be limited by physicians' difficulty in&#xD;
      identifying patients at imminent risk. Reliable prediction of these events may afford&#xD;
      physicians the opportunity to intervene aggressively and potentially minimize the need for&#xD;
      hospitalization or the risk of a serious adverse outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Noninvasive impedance cardiography (ICG) is a simple test that utilizes changes in thoracic&#xD;
      electrical impedance to measure thoracic fluid content, changes in the duration of cardiac&#xD;
      ejection and the velocity of blood flow within the aorta. ICG has been used to estimate&#xD;
      cardiac output and cardiac filling pressure in patients with or without heart failure (HF).&#xD;
&#xD;
      PREVENT-HF is a randomized prospective study being conducted at up to 35 experienced&#xD;
      investigative centers from the United States, Canada, and Europe. Subjects will be enrolled&#xD;
      within 4-12 days of a discharge from a hospitalization for exacerbation of heart failure,&#xD;
      with screening procedures to occur prior to the enrollment. Following enrollment, subjects&#xD;
      will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to outpatient management by either clinical assessment&#xD;
      (Standard Care Arm) or ICG in addition to clinical assessment (ICG Arm) during the enrollment&#xD;
      visit. ICG variables will be collected in all subjects but will be blinded in the Standard&#xD;
      Care Arm. Each subject's study participation will last for a minimum of 24 weeks and a&#xD;
      maximum of 52 weeks post-discharge. Four weeks after hospital discharge, subjects will visit&#xD;
      the clinic. Remaining study visits will occur every four weeks thereafter until the subject&#xD;
      has completed the 52-week visit or until the subject has experienced a hospitalization that&#xD;
      has been adjudicated by the Clinical Events Committee as being a heart failure&#xD;
      hospitalization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the PREDICT study, a composite ICG score was the most powerful predictor of a short-term&#xD;
      HF event when compared to standard clinical variables. This composite ICG score is provided&#xD;
      for subjects in the PREVENT-HF ICG Arm. If the score indicates a subject is at a higher risk&#xD;
      for a short-term HF event, clinicians will be required to intervene. Clinicians may intervene&#xD;
      if indicated by the subject's clinical status for an intermediate-risk score, and&#xD;
      intervention is not recommended based on the ICG score for lower-risk scores. Compliance to&#xD;
      these guidelines will be tracked.&#xD;
