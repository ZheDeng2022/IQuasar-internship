      Background By means of measurements of series of non-invasive inflammatory markers in exhaled&#xD;
      breath (condensate), a reflection of inflammatory processes and oxidative stress, can be&#xD;
      obtained. Thereby, these techniques could be important in monitoring asthma and CF lung&#xD;
      disease in children. Fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO) and inflammatory markers in&#xD;
      exhaled breath condensate (EBC) reflect ongoing inflammation and oxidative stress in the&#xD;
      airways. These markers have a promising capacity for monitoring diagnoses of CF and asthma&#xD;
      lung disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim To study the course of inflammatory markers in time in children with asthma and CF, in&#xD;
      stable periods and during pulmonary exacerbations. In addition, we study the ability of&#xD;
      inflammatory markers to predict safe tapering of medical treatment in both populations.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To study the course of inflammatory markers in EBC during an exacerbation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To study which IM are already elevated before a clinical exacerbation is evident and can&#xD;
           predict exacerbations in time.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To study which inflammatory markers can predict safe discontinuation of antibiotics in&#xD;
           children with CF, or tapering of inhaled corticosteroids in children with asthma.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To study the relationship between inflammatory markers in EBC, the severity and control&#xD;
           of CF and asthma, the symptoms and lung function within patients will be analysed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods Children with CF (n=30) and children with asthma (n=40) were recruited included from&#xD;
      our outpatient clinic. During this longitudinal study patients visit the outpatient clinic&#xD;
      were followed-up for 12 months; every two months during one year. patients visited our&#xD;
      outpatient clinic. In addition to these standard visits, During exacerbations patients four&#xD;
      extra visits were planned during an exacerbation. were asked to visit the University Hospital&#xD;
      Maastricht four times. These additional visits were planned with a maximum of two times&#xD;
      during the study. By means of a home monitor, children were asked to assess measurements of&#xD;
      Besides measurements in the University Hospital, children measured forced expiratory volume&#xD;
      in one second (FEV1) at home using a home monitor, to record medication use, and, to record&#xD;
      presence and severity of pulmonary symptoms. Outcome parameters were: 1) FeNO assessment in&#xD;
      exhaled air, 2) inflammatory markers in EBC, 3) lung function parameters, 4) specific&#xD;
      questionnaires to assess asthma and CF control and severity, 5) data originating from the&#xD;
      home monitor.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Asthma is defined as a chronic inflammatory disorder, leading to recurrent episodes of&#xD;
             wheezing, breathlessness, chest tightness, and/or coughing, based on variable airway&#xD;
             obstruction [18]. Children with docter-diagnosed asthma known at the department of&#xD;
             Paediatric Pulmonology, were recruited from the University Hospital Maastricht. Atopic&#xD;
             and not atopic asthmatic children were allowed; treatment with inhalation&#xD;
             corticosteroïd (ICS) was not obliged.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Children known with CF were recruited from University Hospital Maastricht. CF was&#xD;
             defined as a combination of typical clinical features and an abnormal sweat test&#xD;
             (Chloride &gt; 60 mM). CF lung disease was treated according to the CBO consensus ref.&#xD;
             Main aspects of treatment were:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  antibiotic treatment,&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  agents to promote airway secretion clearance, such as DNase,&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  bronchodilators, and,&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  physiotherapy. All alternations of medical therapy were allowed and accurately&#xD;
                  documented.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Diseases that may interfere with the results of the study (e.g. upper airway&#xD;
             infection, cor vitium, anatomic abnormalities of the airway and other chronic&#xD;
             inflammatory diseases, such as Morbus Crohn and rheumatoid arthritis),&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Mental retardation,&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Inability to perform measurements properly,&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Active smoking and,&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Use of the following medication: papaverin, sodium nitroprusside,&#xD;
             angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, oxymetazoline, L-arginine, or nitric&#xD;
             oxide synthase (NOS) inhibitors&#xD;
