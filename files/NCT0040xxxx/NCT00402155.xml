      Reading can be an uncomfortable and difficult task for some people. Symptoms include&#xD;
      unpleasant somatic and perceptual effects, such as eye-strain, headache, and blurred text,&#xD;
      despite normal visual acuity. This condition has been called Visual Discomfort, but little is&#xD;
      known about the symptoms and frequency of reading problems associated with this disorder.&#xD;
      Several studies have proposed that Visual Discomfort is caused by increased noise in the&#xD;
      visual system due to spreading cortical activation across different spatial frequency&#xD;
      channels. This study examines the prevalence and severity of visual discomfort in a college&#xD;
      student population and tests the noisy visual system hypothesis.&#xD;

      Wilkins et al (1980) found that paroxysmal activity in photosensitive epileptic patients can&#xD;
      be triggered by binocular viewing of a large repetitive striped pattern with a spatial&#xD;
      frequency of 1-4 cycles deg-1, a contrast of 10% or more, and a duty cycle of 50%.&#xD;
      Sensitivity to this visual pattern varies in the non-epileptic population (Wilkins et al,&#xD;
      1984) but can produce unpleasant somatic (e.g., eye-strain, headache) and perceptual effects&#xD;
      (e.g., flicker, color illusions). This condition has been termed visual discomfort (Wilkins&#xD;
      et al., 1984) or visual stress (Wilkins, 1995).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Reading can be especially difficult for those with visual discomfort because most printed&#xD;
      text is a repetitive striped pattern with the same characteristics that cause visual&#xD;
      discomfort; that is, spatial frequencies between 1-6 cycles deg-1 (Legge et al., 1985), high&#xD;
      contrast, and 50% duty cycle (Wilkins &amp; Nimmo-Smith, 1984; 1987). Those with visual&#xD;
      discomfort report a variety of symptoms when they read, such as, movement of print, blurring,&#xD;
      letter distortion (size, doubling, fading or darkening), patterns appearing in white spaces,&#xD;
      color illusions as letter highlights or moving blobs, nausea, dizziness, headache,&#xD;
      eye-strain, and glare discomfort (Wilkins, 2003). One study (Wilkins &amp; Nimmo-Smith, 1987)&#xD;
      found that decreasing the duty cycle (double or triple spacing the lines of text) was&#xD;
      sufficient to reduce or eliminate most of the unpleasant symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Symptom frequency while reading appears to vary with a person's sensitivity to the striped&#xD;
      pattern (Conlon et al., 1998) and is more common among those who suffer from headaches or&#xD;
      migraines (Wilkins et al, 1984; Conlon et al., 1999). Effective reading time is considerably&#xD;
      reduced by visual discomfort symptoms (Conlon et al, 1998; Conlon et al, 1999, Wilkins,&#xD;
      2003). Most college students with visual discomfort cannot read for more than an hour at a&#xD;
      time without taking a break (Conlon et al., 1999).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Very little is known about the symptoms and frequency of reading problems associated with&#xD;
      visual discomfort. Conlon et al (1999) has conducted the only study that has used a symptom&#xD;
      questionnaire with published validity and reliability. The scale consists of 23 items that&#xD;
      sample a wide variety of visual symptoms associated with reading using a four point rating&#xD;
      scale. The internal consistency of the scale was high (Cronbach alpha = .91), and several&#xD;
      experiments confirmed the scale could predict unpleasant symptom frequency and performance&#xD;
      efficiency while reading.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The scale was normed on a sample of 515 college student volunteers from Australia.&#xD;
      Individuals were rated as having low, moderate, or severe discomfort based on total rating&#xD;
      scores below 35%, 35-69.5%, and above 70%, respectively. Twelve percent were classified as&#xD;
      severe and 35% as moderate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experiments with a sample of the normative group were conducted to validate the scale. They&#xD;
      checked for normal or corrected normal visual acuity but did not screen for other concomitant&#xD;
      conditions, such as oculomotor dysfunction or learning disabilities. The most frequently&#xD;
      reported symptoms included text movement, the appearance of color, and eye-strain. Headache,&#xD;
      dizziness and visual distortions were reported infrequently. Oral reading rate was highly&#xD;
      correlated (r = .71) with visual discomfort scores. Conlon (personal communication) has found&#xD;
      that individuals with visual discomfort read silently at a normal rate but comprehension&#xD;
      suffers, whereas oral reading rate is impaired but comprehension is good.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mechanisms of Visual Discomfort.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Three different mechanisms have been proposed that could induce visual discomfort while&#xD;
      reading.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A. Noisy visual system. Working from a model of visual epilepsy, Wilkins (1986) has proposed&#xD;
      that visual discomfort is caused by hypersensitivity in some cortical cells that share&#xD;
      sensitivity for a particular spatial frequency and orientation. Several studies have examined&#xD;
      the contrast sensitivity functions (CSF) of high visual discomfort individuals and found&#xD;
      weaker sensitivity at intermediate (Wilkins et al., 1984) and sometimes at higher spatial&#xD;
      frequencies (Conlon, Lovegrove, Barker, &amp; Chekaluk, 2001). A recent pilot study of ten&#xD;
      children with visual discomfort found differences in visual evoked potential (VEP) amplitudes&#xD;
      among those with a history of headache and migraines (Riddell, Wilkins, &amp; Hainline, 2006).&#xD;
&#xD;
      These results have been interpreted as evidence for greater noise in the visual system.&#xD;
      Prolonged exposure to a single spatial frequency is thought to increase localized cortical&#xD;
      excitation that spreads to adjacent cells in a different spatial frequency channel. This&#xD;
      spreading of cortical activation is what causes the unpleasant symptoms. Studies by Wilkins&#xD;
      and colleagues (1984) showed the most common spatial frequency at which unpleasant symptoms&#xD;
      occurred was at 4 cycles deg-1 - the peak of the contrast sensitivity function. Conlon et al.&#xD;
      (1999) presented a similar cortical model in which visual discomfort is caused by 'noise' due&#xD;
      to poor inhibitory connections between spatial frequency channels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      B. Accommodative and Vergence Insufficiency. Visual discomfort symptoms also have been&#xD;
      association with convergence and accommodative insufficiency in children (Evans et al, 1995;&#xD;
      Evans et al, 1996; Borsting et al., 1999; 2003, 2004). Convergence Insufficiency (CI), or&#xD;
      difficulty maintaining binocular fusion of an approaching object, is defined by one or more&#xD;
      clinical signs that include: exophoria at near that is greater than at distance, decreased&#xD;
      positive fusional vergence, and a near point of convergence that has receded. The prevalence&#xD;
      of CI in school-aged children varies from about 4-8% depending on the presence of two or&#xD;
      three CI signs (Rouse et al., 1997; Rouse et al., 1999). Accommodative insufficiency (AI), or&#xD;
      difficulty maintaining focus on an approaching target, is often associated with CI. Borsting&#xD;
      et al. (2003) found that 40% of school-aged children with AI also had CI, and almost 80% of&#xD;
      those with all three signs of CI had AI. Borsting et al (2003) found children with normal&#xD;
      binocular vision had an average symptom score of 3.8, whereas the three-sign CI and AI&#xD;
      children reported significantly more symptoms, averaging 6.7 and 6.4, respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently, Rouse et al (2004) administered a revised version of the Convergence Insufficiency&#xD;
      Symptom Survey (CISS) to 46 adults with CI and 46 with normal binocular vision to assess&#xD;
      reliability and validity. The CISS is a 15 item 4-point Likert survey that quantifies the&#xD;
      severity symptoms with a score range from 0 to 60. The mean CISS score for the CI and normal&#xD;
      groups were 37.3 and 11.0, respectively. The interclass correlation coefficient was 0.89, and&#xD;
      the 95% limits of agreement were -9.0 to 7.6 indicating good to excellent reliability. These&#xD;
      results raise questions about the CI and AI of adults with visual discomfort symptoms and&#xD;
      suggest oculomotor dysfunction could be a possible cause of this disorder.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A comparison of several items between Conlon's Visual Discomfort Survey and the CISS shows&#xD;
      striking similarities and suggest the two surveys are measuring similar symptomatology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      C. Longitudinal Chromatic Aberration. The focal characteristics of the accommodative response&#xD;
      also are affected by longitudinal chromatic aberration (Kruger et al., 1995; Lee et al.,&#xD;
      1999; Stark et al., 2002; Rucker &amp; Kruger, 2004; Rucker &amp; Kruger 2006). When the L/M-cone&#xD;
      contrast ratio of a stimulus is high, the mean accommodation level decreases, biasing the&#xD;
      response towards far; S-cone stimulus contrast biases the response towards near (Stark et&#xD;
      al., 2002; Rucker &amp; Kruger, 2004). A low-pass filter reduces accommodation demand by 0.50 D&#xD;
      (Kroger &amp; Binder, 2000), and reading performance tends to be better with blue transmitting&#xD;
      filters (Solman, Cho, &amp; Dain, 1991; Williams, Lecluyse, &amp; Rock-Fauchex, 1992; Solan, 1998;&#xD;
      Iovino et al., 1998; Edwards &amp; Hogben, 1999; Ray, Fowler, &amp; Stein, 2005), whereas diffuse red&#xD;
      light impairs reading (Chase et al., 2003).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Children with higher L/M ratio sensitivity are poorer readers (Chase et al., in press). This&#xD;
      L/M ratio variation may affect their accommodative response and interfere with text&#xD;
      perception. Wilkins et al. (2005) found that individuals who benefit from color filters while&#xD;
      reading preferred very specific hues and saturations, perhaps to compensate for individual&#xD;
      accommodative bias.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ray et al. (2005) reported a high proportion (39%) of reading-impaired children had poor&#xD;
      accommodation. The use of yellow filters significantly may have normalized their&#xD;
      accommodative response by balancing L- and M-cone input (Stromeyer et al., 1997; Stromeyer et&#xD;
      al., 2000), and reading skills improved more in those who used yellow filters than a placebo.&#xD;
      Simmers et al. (2001) found significantly higher variability in the low frequency component&#xD;
      of accommodative response functions among five subjects with visual discomfort symptoms. This&#xD;
      variability decreased to normal levels when color filters were used or luminance was reduced.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To explore these alternative hypotheses, we will administer the Visual Discomfort Scale to a&#xD;
      large sample of students and measure the prevalence, severity and symptom patterns of this&#xD;
      problem in a college population. A stratified, random sample of 100 students will receive a&#xD;
      vision and psycho-educational assessment to screen for concomitant conditions that might&#xD;
      hamper reading performance or contribute symptoms of visual discomfort. Vision testing&#xD;
      includes an optometric exam to assess accommodation and vergence, CSF to test for noisy SF&#xD;
      channels, and electroretinograms (ERG) and visual evoked potentials (VEP) to measure L/M cone&#xD;
      sensitivity variation.&#xD;
