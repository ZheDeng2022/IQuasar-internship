      The study will be undertaken at the ENT department of the Leicester Royal Infirmary and in a&#xD;
      research laboratory at the University of Leicester and also in the ENT department at the West&#xD;
      Suffolk Hospital. One hundred subjects will be recruited. Subjects will be invited to undergo&#xD;
      a series of smell tests using graded concentrations of 4 odours in 120ml bottles (1). This&#xD;
      test has been described and validated by our previous work (2). The test will be fully&#xD;
      explained to the subject beforehand by the researcher who will test the patient. The subject&#xD;
      will be started with the smallest concentration of each odour and will ascend through the&#xD;
      bottles until they detect 2 in a row, at which point the weaker concentration of the odour&#xD;
      will be taken as their threshold. They will have a threshold levels determined for the odours&#xD;
      phenethyl alcohol (roses), mercaptan (gas), acetic acid (vinegar) and eucalyptol (menthol).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Then, the subject will undergo a sodium citrate nasal douche at a specific concentration or&#xD;
      will douche with sterile water. There will be three concentrations used (3%, 6% and 9%) and a&#xD;
      control solution (sterile water). Patients will be randomly allocated to one of the four&#xD;
      groups using a coded bottle system. Both patient and tester will be blinded to the solution&#xD;
      used as these will be made in the pharmacy and coded for anonymity - the code will be broken&#xD;
      at the end of the trial. Subjects will then be retested with the bottles and threshold levels&#xD;
      will be observed for the four odours at 15 minute intervals over 2 hours. The purpose of the&#xD;
      repeated tests is to determine the length of the effect (if present) of the citrate on the&#xD;
      olfactory ability of the patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      (N.B. Sodium citrate is a licensed product for use in body cavities (e.g. stomach, bladder)&#xD;
      and can be found in the British National Formulary - the concentrations proposed do not&#xD;
      exceed those used elsewhere.)&#xD;
