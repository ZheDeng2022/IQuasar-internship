  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to determine the safety of IL-12 gene therapy for patients with&#xD;
      recurrence of prostate cancer after radiation therapy and those with or without metastatic&#xD;
      disease with a prostate gland intact. These, of course, would include recurrent prostate&#xD;
      cancer after definitive radiation therapy. The prostate cancer will be treated with a&#xD;
      prostatic injection of a replication-defective adenovirus vector delivering the IL-12 gene.&#xD;
      Following virus injection, patients will be hospitalized for 23 hours for observation. Only&#xD;
      one course of therapy will be administered. Each patient will be carefully monitored for&#xD;
      toxic effects. Three to five patients will be tested with a low dose of virus and if there&#xD;
      are no serious adverse side effects, the dose will be slowly escalated in subsequent groups&#xD;
      of 3-5 patients or until unacceptable toxicity is reached. Effectiveness will be monitored by&#xD;
      serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA), transrectal ultrasound of the prostate, prostate&#xD;
      biopsy and comparison of survival times to historical survival times for patients with&#xD;
      radiation recurrent prostate tumors. The primary objective of this initial study is to&#xD;
      determine whether the treatment is associated with significant toxicity.&#xD;

      The development of a clinical trial for gene therapy in prostate cancer will be coordinated&#xD;
      with our collaborators at Baylor involved in similar studies in order to facilitate the&#xD;
      approval process. We have submitted a proposal to the NIH Recombinant DNA Advisory Committee&#xD;
      (RAC) committee for accelerated review. A detailed clinical protocol and informed consent for&#xD;
      a Phase I clinical trial of gene therapy for prostate cancer has been approved by the Baylor&#xD;
      Affiliates Review Board and the FDA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Human subjects included in this project will be limited to men who have biopsy-proven local&#xD;
      recurrence or persistence of cancer in the prostate gland with or without metastatic disease&#xD;
      after hormone therapy, cryosurgery and/or definitive irradiation therapy. Patients with&#xD;
      biopsy-proven prostate cancer, clinical stages T1-T3, Nx-N1 or M0-M1 are eligible.&#xD;
      Biologically active local recurrence of tumor will be defined as biopsy-proven cancer in the&#xD;
      prostate, at least one year after the completion of radiation therapy, in a patient who has a&#xD;
      rising serum PSA level on at least 3 separate occasions at least 2 weeks apart.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will also be carefully followed to document toxicity, using standard CTEP toxicity&#xD;
      criteria. Responses will be categorized as follows: progressive disease, stable disease,&#xD;
      partial objective response, and complete objective response. Progressive disease will be&#xD;
      defined as a rise in the serum PSA level by 25% in the first 3 months and thereafter, a&#xD;
      positive biopsy in conjunction with an enlarging nodule on digital rectal exam or an&#xD;
      enlarging hypoechoic lesion on ultrasound, or the development of new symptoms clearly related&#xD;
      to the cancer in the presence of a positive biopsy, or the presence on biopsy of cancer of&#xD;
      higher grade or cancer that is more extensive. A complete response will be defined as a serum&#xD;
      PSA level that decreases to less than 1 ng/ml, in combination with a negative biopsy of the&#xD;
      prostate and the absence of symptoms referable to cancer. A partial objective response would&#xD;
      be a PSA level that decreases by at least 50% compared to baseline in association with a&#xD;
      biopsy result that shows clearly diminished or minimum but persistent cancer cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This Phase I study is designed to evaluate the safety of Adv/IL-12 gene therapy with an&#xD;
      intent to offer a potential therapeutic advantage. The potential risks associated with the&#xD;
      use of gene therapy in this group would appear reasonable in so far as evaluations will be&#xD;
      frequent and progression (should it occur) will be found early and allow rapid movement of&#xD;
      the patient to other possible therapies. Effectiveness will be monitored by serum PSA,&#xD;
      transrectal ultrasound of the prostate, prostate biopsy and comparison of survival times to&#xD;
      historical survival times for patients with radiation recurrent prostate tumors. Additional&#xD;
      research laboratory analyses will be performed to evaluate the immune response engendered by&#xD;
      this gene therapy protocol. This will consist of analysis of serum and/or plasma and urine&#xD;
      for systemic cytokine production using standard ELISA methodologies that we have performed in&#xD;
      previous studies. In addition we will collect whole blood for the analysis of T cells by flow&#xD;
      cytometry. We have established protocols for this analysis that can detect total CD4 and CD8&#xD;
      cells as well as those that express markers of activation such as HLA/DR.&#xD;
