  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary aim of this protocol is to investigate a possible new, neuroprotective treatment&#xD;
      to prevent cognitive deficits that occur after carotid endarterectomy. We will investigate&#xD;
      whether a widely used antibiotic agent - minocycline - that has shown neuroprotective effects&#xD;
      in animal models of neurological diseases - can reduce the cognitive deficits associated with&#xD;
      the surgical procedure of carotid endarterectomy (CEA). Because these cognitive deficits are&#xD;
      believed to be a result of small strokes (due to emboli and/or hypoperfusion), this study&#xD;
      will provide preliminary data on the use of this drug as a neuroprotective agent in stroke -&#xD;
      a leading cause of disability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      (1) The first aim of this study is to examine whether 5 doses of minocycline administered 36&#xD;
      hrs before and 1 dose 12 hrs after the surgical procedure in patients undergoing CEA are&#xD;
      effective to reduce the cognitive deficits associated with this procedure as compared with&#xD;
      placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      a. The null hypothesis is that there is no difference in cognitive performance changes after&#xD;
      CEA between the patients that receive placebo or minocycline.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This protocol is a phase IIa study that will prospectively investigate whether minocycline&#xD;
      (an antibiotic that showed neuroprotective effects in animal models) can decrease the&#xD;
      cognitive deficits associated with carotid endarterectomy. This trial will be a randomized,&#xD;
      parallel-group design, double-blind, placebo controlled clinical trial conducted at the&#xD;
      Brigham and Women's Hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The principal aim of this investigation is to study the effects of minocycline on cognitive&#xD;
      performance after carotid endarterectomy. To measure cognitive function, we will perform a&#xD;
      neuropsychological battery of tests (as detailed below). This battery of tests will be&#xD;
      carried out by a blinded rater (a neurologist) and will be performed according to the&#xD;
      following timetable:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Training session: before the baseline, patients will perform the tasks several times until&#xD;
      they reach a stable plateau (defined as a variation of less than 10% in the last three&#xD;
      trials) in order to eliminate the confounding effect of learning.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline evaluation: the baseline evaluation will be performed in the day prior to the&#xD;
      surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post-treatment evaluation: post-treatment evaluation will be performed 24 hours after the&#xD;
      surgical procedure by the same blinded rater.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Neuropsychological battery of tests: we based our neuropsychological battery of tests on a&#xD;
      similar study that evaluated the cognitive deficits associated with CEA and will consist of&#xD;
      the following tests:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Trail making test - parts A and B (this test evaluates visual concept and visuo-motor&#xD;
           track)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Controlled Oral Word Association (letters C, F and L) (this test evaluates verbal&#xD;
           fluency)&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. The Boston Naming Test (naming of 60 pictures) (this test evaluates left hemisphere&#xD;
           damage)&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Digit Span Forward and Backward (this test evaluates working memory)&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Stroop Task (this test evaluates selective attention and mental flexibility)&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Mini-mental state examination (this test evaluates an adult patient's level of global&#xD;
           cognitive functioning)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood sample analysis: As a secondary outcome, we will analyze subjects blood sample in&#xD;
      respect to two particular substances: S100B and neuron specific enolase. The rationale for&#xD;
      performing proteomic studies is that past research has shown that subtle cerebral injuries&#xD;
      after carotid endarterectomy, even in the absence of stroke, might be associated with a&#xD;
      significant increase in serum S100B (Connolly, 2001 - Neurosurgery, 2001 49 (5)) and also in&#xD;
      traumatic brain injury (Cotena, 2006, J Neurosurg 2006 104 (6)). In addition, neuron specific&#xD;
      enolase (NSE) also seems to be valuable to predict brain damage in patients with brain&#xD;
      traumatic injury (Naeimi, 2006 - Brain Inj 2006 20(5)), thus showing that these two&#xD;
      substances might be important biomarkers to be investigated in our study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After eligibility screening (inclusion and exclusion criteria), consent form, medical history&#xD;
      and physical exam participants will be randomized to the exposure - minocycline or placebo.&#xD;
      The pills (minocycline and placebo) will have the same appearance and only one person will&#xD;
      know whether the treatment is active or placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Because our sample size will be relatively small, participants will be randomized to&#xD;
      minocycline or placebo through a randomization stratification approach. This approach will&#xD;
      ensure that both groups will have a similar distribution regarding baseline performance in&#xD;
      the cognitive tests. Participants will be gathered into groups (strata) defined by their&#xD;
      performance in the neuropsychological tasks (baseline). Participants within each stratum will&#xD;
      be randomized to one of two treatment groups - minocycline and placebo - according to a block&#xD;
      randomization of four and using a randomization list generated by a computer that will take&#xD;
      into account the study entrance order. These groups are defined as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Minocycline: we will use the dosage of minocycline that is currently used for clinical&#xD;
      indications and also used in trials employing this drug as an anti-inflammatory agent.&#xD;
      Minocycline will be administered in the period of 36 hrs before surgery (100 mg twice a day&#xD;
      and 200 mg in the morning of the surgery - total of 5 doses) and 12 hrs after surgery (single&#xD;
      dose of 100 mg).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The two doses of minocycline administered in the morning of the surgery will be taken with a&#xD;
      small sip of water.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Placebo: placebo pill will have the same appearance as the real drug (minocycline) and will&#xD;
      be administered using the same timetable as the active drug.&#xD;
