  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this multi-center, randomized, clinical study is to establish the safety and&#xD;
      effectiveness of the TOPS™ System, used following decompression, in the treatment of lower&#xD;
      back and leg pain with, or without spinal claudication, that results from moderate or severe&#xD;
      lumbar spinal stenosis at one vertebral level between L3 and L5.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is being conducted to evaluate a new surgical implant (TOPS™ System, Impliant).&#xD;
      The TOPS™ System is an alternative to spinal fusion that is designed to stabilize but not&#xD;
      fuse the affected vertebral level following decompression surgery to alleviate pain stemming&#xD;
      from moderate/severe lumbar spinal stenosis while maintaining range of motion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When non-surgical treatment is ineffective, decompression (including laminectomy and medial&#xD;
      facetectomy) and fusion of the spinal segments with moderate/severe lumbar spinal stenosis&#xD;
      has been used to stabilize the motion segment and to alleviate the patient's clinical&#xD;
      symptoms. Spinal fusion surgery using metal instrumentation is designed to stop motion at a&#xD;
      painful, unstable spinal segment by permanently fusing the segment. While fusion may decrease&#xD;
      pain generated at the treated segment, the procedure also eliminate motion at the implanted&#xD;
      level and transfers and thus increases loads on the adjacent segments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The TOPS System is intended to provide stabilization following decompression in patients with&#xD;
      disease at one level from L3 to L5. The ideal goal of stabilization is to preserve mobility&#xD;
      but eliminate abnormal motion and prevent deformity. By using the TOPS System, it may be&#xD;
      possible to preserve load-bearing dynamics and spinal biomechanics, and thereby maintaining&#xD;
      motion at the treated segment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The TOPS surgical technique, utilizing a standard top loading pedicle screw-based system, is&#xD;
      the same as a standard posterior spinal fusion with the exception of the placement of the&#xD;
      TOPS motion segment. Therefore, the surgeon will be executing the steps of surgical exposure,&#xD;
      decompression, insertion of pedicle screws (with attention to proper placement/alignment) and&#xD;
      closure in the same manner as he/she would in a standard posterior spinal fusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of the clinical investigation is to compare the safety and effectiveness of the&#xD;
      TOPS System to a control group of patients undergoing posterior spinal fusion with pedicle&#xD;
      screws and local autograft bone in the treatment of back and leg pain that results from&#xD;
      moderate/severe lumbar spinal stenosis at a single vertebral level between L3 to L5.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior to entering the study, patients will be evaluated by the investigator according to the&#xD;
      inclusion/exclusion criteria. Patients recruited to the study will be randomized in a 1:1&#xD;
      ratio to undergo implantation of the TOPS System or the control spinal fusion procedure.&#xD;
      Patient follow-up will be evaluated immediately post-operatively and at discharge, 6 weeks, 3&#xD;
      months, 6 months, 12 months, and 24 months.&#xD;
