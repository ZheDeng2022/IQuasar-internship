  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare outcomes of combined chiropractic care in anterior&#xD;
      knee pain patients with patellofemoral pain syndrome.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Exercise is standard of care for PFPS but gives limited pain reduction and functional&#xD;
      improvement. Previous manipulative therapy for PFPS (with and without exercise) has been&#xD;
      limited to the patellofemoral joint alone. However, literature suggests additional&#xD;
      manipulative therapy with exercise and soft-tissue treatment may give a better outcome.&#xD;
      Further research is needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, this project is a pilot study to inform a future randomized controlled trial to&#xD;
      determine if chiropractic adjusting of the full lower extremity (lumbosacral through foot)&#xD;
      combined with exercise and soft tissue treatment (Protocol and group A) is superior to&#xD;
      chiropractic adjusting of the knee (alone) combined with exercise and soft tissue treatment&#xD;
      (Protocol and group B) in the treatment of patellofemoral pain syndrome. We will use the&#xD;
      Anterior Knee Pain Scale (AKPS) and Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) as valid and reliable primary&#xD;
      outcome measures, a functional measure (step-ups, step-downs and squats) and a Patient&#xD;
      Satisfaction Scale (PSS - discharge or refer) as secondary outcome measures. This study will&#xD;
      help establish the feasibility of conducting quality research at Cleveland Chiropractic&#xD;
      College Los Angeles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this pilot study there will be two groups of 10 subjects each&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Group A will receive CMT to the knee only, exercise and soft tissue treatment (Graston&#xD;
           Instrument Soft Tissue Mobilization hereafter GISTM)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Group B will receive CMT to the lumbosacral, sacroiliac and (all) lower extremity&#xD;
           joints, exercise and soft tissue treatment (GISTM).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Enrolled subjects will receive a total of 6 treatments. The primary endpoint will be a 2&#xD;
      month follow-up after the 6th treatment.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  anterior, peri or retropatellar knee pain &gt;3 months from at least two of the&#xD;
             following: prolonged sitting, stair-climbing, squatting, running, kneeling, and&#xD;
             hopping/jumping or overuse activities. Pain is relieved by rest.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  insidious onset of symptoms unrelated to a traumatic incident; and&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  presence of pain on palpation of the patellar facets, on step down from a 25-cm step,&#xD;
             or during a double-legged squat&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  other disorders such as OA, instability or medial meniscus injury must be ruled out&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  X-ray or MRI findings not required. There is no clear correlation between severity of&#xD;
             complaints and arthroscopic or radiologic findings&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A VAS-Worst pain of ≥ 5.0; a AKPS of ≥ 50.This reflects the current probability that&#xD;
             less PFPS patients with less severity currently consult chiropractors for this&#xD;
