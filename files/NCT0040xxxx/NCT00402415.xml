  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There are two drugs involved in this study. Sunitinib (Sutent(R)) is approved by the Food and&#xD;
      Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of advanced renal cell (kidney) cancer and&#xD;
      gastrointestinal stromal tumors. Sunitinib is thought to work by blocking the growth of blood&#xD;
      vessels into tumors; reducing the blood supply to tumors can slow their growth and sometimes&#xD;
      causes the tumors to shrink. Sirolimus has been approved by the FDA to prevent the body from&#xD;
      rejecting organ transplants. Sirolimus is being tested for its effects against cancer because&#xD;
      it can slow the growth of some tumors in animal models. Sirolimus is thought to slow cancer&#xD;
      growth in these animal models both by direct effects on the tumor cells, and also by blocking&#xD;
      production of growth factors that stimulate production of blood vessels. We hope that the&#xD;
      combined use of these two drugs will have better anti-cancer effects than either agent alone.&#xD;
      This study is designed to find out if different doses of Sirolimus combined with a standard&#xD;
      dose of Sutent are safe and well tolerated. Additionally, it is hoped to gain knowledge about&#xD;
      the way that Sutent(R) in combination with sirolimus affects the blood vessels produced by&#xD;
      cancer.&#xD;

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have histologically confirmed malignancy that is metastatic or&#xD;
             unresectable and for which standard curative or palliative measures do not exist or&#xD;
             are no longer effective. Patients with previously untreated metastatic renal cell&#xD;
             carcinoma are eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have measurable disease by RECIST criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have at least 1 lesion located in the neck, lung, solid organ (including&#xD;
             liver) or soft tissue in abdomen or pelvis, or soft tissue in lower extremities that&#xD;
             is 3 cm and ideally &lt;7 cm in the transaxial plane. Larger lesions may be considered if&#xD;
             they meet all other criteria. Index lesions must be well demarcated.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  ECOG performance status of 0-1.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Must be ≥18 years of age.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Women of child-bearing potential (i.e., women who are pre-menopausal or not surgically&#xD;
             sterile) must use acceptable contraceptive methods (abstinence, intrauterine device&#xD;
             [IUD], oral contraceptive or double barrier device), and must have a negative serum or&#xD;
             urine pregnancy test within 1 week prior to beginning treatment on this trial. Nursing&#xD;
             patients are excluded. Sexually active men must also use acceptable contraceptive&#xD;
             methods. Pregnant and nursing patients are excluded because the effects of the&#xD;
             combination of SU11248 (Sutent®) and sirolimus on a fetus or nursing child are&#xD;
             unknown.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Patients must have the following clinical laboratory values: ANC count ≥1500/mm3;&#xD;
             Platelets ≥100,000/mm3; Serum creatinine ≤2x upper limit of normal. If serum&#xD;
             creatinine is above the upper limit of normal (but less than 2x normal), patients must&#xD;
             have a measured 24 hour urine creatinine clearance ≥ 50 ml/min to be eligible; Total&#xD;
             bilirubin &lt; 1.5x upper limit of normal; Serum calcium &lt; 12.0 mg/dl; Alanine&#xD;

&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Diagnosis or history of central nervous system (CNS) disease (i.e. primary brain&#xD;
             tumor, malignant seizures, CNS metastases or carcinomatous meningitis).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any active uncontrolled bleeding and any patient with a bleeding diathesis (for&#xD;
             example, active peptic ulcer disease). Any grade 3 hemorrhage within 4 weeks prior to&#xD;
             starting treatment.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Hypertension that cannot be controlled by medications (&gt;150/100 mm Hg despite optimal&#xD;
             medical therapy).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  QTc interval &gt; 500 msec on baseline EKG.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Cardiac ejection fraction below institutional lower limit of normal.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Measured 24-hour urine creatinine clearance &lt; 50 ml/min.&#xD;

             cerebrovascular accident or transient ischemic attack, or pulmonary embolus.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Known HIV infection. Patients with HIV infection are excluded because there may be&#xD;
             unknown or dangerous drug interactions between sirolimus/SU11248 (Sutent®) and the&#xD;

             carcinomas of the skin, or in situ cervical cancer, or any stage I malignancy &gt; 2&#xD;
             years from treatment).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Other severe acute or chronic medical or psychiatric condition or laboratory&#xD;
             abnormality that may increase the risk associated with study participation or study&#xD;
             drug administration, or may interfere with the interpretation of study results, and in&#xD;
             the judgment of the investigator would make the subject inappropriate for entry into&#xD;
             this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients taking concurrent medications of any kind which are strong inducers or&#xD;
