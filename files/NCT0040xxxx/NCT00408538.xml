  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is the first to try this product in the rectum of humans. This study is only to&#xD;
      find out if the gel is safe for use in the rectum, not to see if the gel works. Information&#xD;
      gathered from this study will help investigators decide whether this gel is safe enough to&#xD;
      move onto the next phase of studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Information gathered from this study will also help investigators determine what participants&#xD;
      did and did not like about the product and what types of products people might want to use in&#xD;
      the future. Currently condoms and abstinence are the only methods proven to prevent the&#xD;
      spread of HIV sexually.&#xD;

      The purpose of this study is to obtain preliminary data on the safety and acceptability of&#xD;
      UC-781 vaginal microbicide gel (0.1% and 0.25%) versus placebo when rectally administered in&#xD;
      HIV-1 seronegative adults.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will enter a screening period, which includes Visit 1 and if necessary a&#xD;
      medication washout period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects who are deemed eligible after this screening period will return for a baseline&#xD;
      evaluation (Visit 2), including clinical evaluation and mucosal specimen collection, as well&#xD;
      as the Baseline Behavioral Questionnaire (BBQ). The BBQ will be administered by Computer&#xD;
      Assisted Self-Interview (CASI). Subjects may complete the web-based CASI in the privacy of&#xD;
      their own home. If a subject does not have access to the Internet, prefers to complete the&#xD;
      BBQ at the study site, or requires assistance in using the CASI, he or she will be&#xD;
      accommodated at the study site.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completing Visits 1 and 2, eligible subjects will be randomized to one of three groups:&#xD;
      0.1% UC-781 gel, 0.25% UC-781 gel, or a placebo gel (12 per group). A subset of 9 subjects (3&#xD;
      from each group) will also participate in a pK sub-study, which will include 6 timepoints&#xD;
      (Visit 3- pre, 0.25 hr, 2 hr, 4 hr, Visit 3A- 24 hr, and Visit 5- 1 day post-QD dose). During&#xD;
      randomization, study staff will be notified if the participant is randomized to the pK&#xD;
      substudy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will involve 2 stages of treatment. Each treatment stage is independent of the&#xD;
      other. This study aims to examine the effects of 2 different dosing regimens, NOT cumulative&#xD;
      safety over the both stages.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once randomized, subjects will return to the clinic (Visit 3), where a single dose of the&#xD;
      study gel (Treatment Stage 1) will be administered followed by clinical evaluation, including&#xD;
      flexible sigmoidoscopy, and sample collection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will return to the clinic for Treatment Stage 2 Clearance (Visit 4), in the week&#xD;
      prior to beginning Treatment Stage 2. If given clearance, the subject may begin Treatment&#xD;
      Stage 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Treatment Stage 2, subjects will begin to self-administer once daily outpatient doses of&#xD;
      the study gel for 7 days. After completion of Stage 2 the subject will complete a Product&#xD;
      Acceptability Questionnaire (PAQ) by CASI and return to clinic for evaluation and specimen&#xD;
      collection (Visit 5).&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of Visit 5, subjects will be contacted by an interviewer to complete an&#xD;
      in-depth phone interview regarding product acceptability.&#xD;
