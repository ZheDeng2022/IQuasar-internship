    <textblock>
      Bevacizumab is an anti-VEGF agent used in approved for use in metastatic colorectal carcinoma&#xD;
      (FDA Approved). This study analyzes the safety and efficacy of off-label Intravitreal&#xD;
      Injection of bevacizumab (Avastin) for CNVM, Macular oedema due to diabetic retinopathy,&#xD;
      vascular occlusion and other retinal disorders.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>

      Purpose: To study the efficacy and safety of invitreal injection of bevacizumab (avastin) in&#xD;
      all the following conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Age related macular degeneration with Juxtafoveal and Subfoveal CNVM: Recurrent CNVM&#xD;
           following PDT and TTT with IVTA. Patient who could not afford PDT, Macugen or Lucentis&#xD;
           which is FDA approved.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Myopic CNVM, Idiopathic CNVM, Inflammatory CNVM and other conditions associated with&#xD;
           CNVM.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Refractory macular oedema due to vein occlusion, Pseudophakia, Clinically significant&#xD;
           macular oedema (CSME) etc. that affects vision and does not respond adequately to usual&#xD;
           treatment methods.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Proliferative diabetic retinopathy, non-resolving vitreous haemorrhage with PDR&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Informed consent were taken from all the patients, based on the guidelines of OMIC&#xD;
           (Ophthalmic mutual insurance company)Avastin: Risk management recommendations and&#xD;
           consent form.&#xD;
&#xD;
      American Academy of ophthalmology-Risk management recommendations for off-label ,&#xD;
      Intravitreal use of Avastin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Included indications, exclusion criteria, possible complications and the off-label status of&#xD;
      the drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Best corrected visual acuity, Fundus Photography, anterior segment examination, Optical&#xD;
      coherence tomography and in selected patients Electrophysiology, VEP and Fundus fluorescein&#xD;
      angiography was done according to surgeons discretion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All the patients were examined on day 1, 1st week and subsequently depending on the surgeons&#xD;
      discretion and tests were performed during follow ups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During follow up best-corrected visual acuity, anterior and posterior segment examination.&#xD;
      Fundus photography, Intraocular pressure and OCT was repeated and in selected patients FFA,&#xD;
      ERG,and VEP was done, physicians follow up was done.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preparation of the Drug:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bevacizumab Avastin (Avastin) comes in a sterile vial (100 mg in 4 ml) preservative free and&#xD;
      ensure safety the vial injection was within a day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Injections were given with 30 gauge needle, tuberculin syringes single use. 0.05ml containing&#xD;
      1.25 mg drug was given intravitreally under all aseptic precautions under topical&#xD;
      anaesthesia,suggested by Flynn , Harry w.and scott, Ingrid u. -Evolving guidelines for&#xD;
      intravitreous injections.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following the injection topical antibiotics was given for 1 week.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: Prospective interventional non randomised case series.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Informed consent process&#xD;
&#xD;
      Informed consent was taken in English and the patients were explained in their local language&#xD;
      by the treating surgeon.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Food and Drug Administration approved Avastin for the treatment of metastatic Colorectal&#xD;
      cancer. It is the first humanized Anti-VEGF antibody, which prevents angiogenesis. Since the&#xD;
      drug is FDA approved the off-label drug is used for Intravitreal usage. For other purposes if&#xD;
      patients are well-informed about the product, base, its use on firm scientific method and&#xD;
      sound medical evidence, and maintain records of its use and effects. Ophthalmologists are&#xD;
      using Avastin &quot;off-label&quot; to treat AMD and similar conditions since research indicates that&#xD;
      VEGF is one of the causes for the growth of the abnormal vessels that cause these conditions.&#xD;
      All the patients were informed about the &quot;off-label&quot; status, which is not FDA approved.&#xD;
      Similar to kenalog, which is FDA approved but the off-label drug is used as Intravitreal&#xD;
      injection to treat eye conditions.&#xD;
