  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      CIDEIM, Centro Internacional de Entrenamiento e Investigaciones Medicas, is conducting a&#xD;
      research study about the disease Cutaneous Leishmaniasis, which is caused by the Leishmania&#xD;
      parasite and causes skin sores. Researchers hope to find out how the human body defends&#xD;
      against Leishmania. A total of 472 individuals, ages 7 to 70 years, belonging to one of the&#xD;
      following groups will be included in this study: recurring disease, chronic disease, disease&#xD;
      with no sign or symptoms (asymptomatic), and healthy individuals. Study procedures will&#xD;
      include a questionnaire and buccal swab (swabbing of the inside of the cheek with a cotton or&#xD;
      wooden applicator). In addition, asymptomatic and healthy individuals will provide a blood&#xD;
      sample. Study participation will be up to 1.5 hours.&#xD;

      The purpose of this study is to define the proportion of low and high expression Mif alleles&#xD;
      in individuals with recurrent or chronic Cutaneous Leishmaniasis and compare it with that of&#xD;
      individuals with asymptomatic infection and healthy donors (controls), in order to determine&#xD;
      if these alleles are associated with outcome of infection. This study is part 2 of a project&#xD;
      that includes DMID protocols 05-0139 and 06-0010. Specific objectives are to: determine the&#xD;
      proportion of low expression (5-CATT) Mif alleles in individuals with recurrent or chronic&#xD;
      cutaneous leishmaniasis, healthy donors (controls), and individuals with asymptomatic&#xD;
      infection; determine the proportion of high expression (6,7,8-CATT) Mif alleles in&#xD;
      individuals with recurrent or chronic cutaneous leishmaniasis, healthy donors (controls), and&#xD;
      individuals with asymptomatic infection; and determine the Mif Genotype repertoire and&#xD;
      frequency distribution in the endemic population of study. This study will be conducted in&#xD;
      472 participants who will be enrolled into one of the following 4 groups: recurrent disease,&#xD;
      chronic disease, asymptomatic infection, and healthy donors (controls). Patients (males and&#xD;
      females) aged between 7-70 years with chronic or recurrent cutaneous leishmaniasis (historic&#xD;
      or active) diagnosed in either Cali (CIDEIM) and Tumaco (San Andr√©s Hospital) on the&#xD;
      Colombian Pacific Coast will be invited to participate in the study. Asymptomatic and healthy&#xD;
      donors (controls) will also be enrolled. Pregnant women will not be enrolled. Consent and&#xD;
      samples will be obtained during a single study visit of up to 1.5 hours. No further follow-up&#xD;
      visits are planned for this study. Genetic material extracted and amplified from buccal swabs&#xD;
      will be used to determine the proportion of low and high expression Mif alleles of each&#xD;
      group. Expression in recurrent and chronic participants will be compared to that of&#xD;
      asymptomatic participants and healthy donors (controls) in order to determine if expression&#xD;
      frequencies are related to the outcome of infection. Blood samples obtained from asymptomatic&#xD;
      and healthy donors will undergo in vitro blastogenesis testing to confirm&#xD;
      asymptomatic/healthy donor status. Study outcome measures are: frequency of low expression&#xD;
      (5-CATT) Mif alleles in participants with recurrent or chronic disease, individuals with&#xD;
      asymptomatic infection and healthy donors (controls); frequency of high expression&#xD;
      (6,7,8-CATT) Mif alleles in participants with recurrent or chronic disease individuals with&#xD;
      asymptomatic infection and healthy donors (controls); and Mif Genotype repertoire and&#xD;
      frequency distribution in the endemic population in the study site.&#xD;
