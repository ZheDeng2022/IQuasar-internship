      This is an open-label, Phase I study of intravitreally administered ranibizumab in subjects&#xD;
      with unresolving CSC and subfoveal fluid. Patients will be evaluated at baseline with&#xD;
      ophthalmic examination, fluorescein angiography, optical coherence tomography, and color&#xD;
      photography. Subjects will receive open-label intravitreal injections of 0.5 mg ranibizumab&#xD;
      administered every 28 days (± 2 days) for 3 injections. Thereafter they are to be evaluated&#xD;
      every month until month 12. Treatment will be administered to patients if there is presence&#xD;
      of active leakage as determined by fluorescein angiography or persistence presence of sub&#xD;
      retinal fluid upon OCT examination at that monthly visit.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A history of persistent central serous chorioretinopathy present for at least 3 months&#xD;
             Best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) of 20/40 (73 letters on the ETDRS chart) to light&#xD;
             perception as measured by ETDRS protocol refraction.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  No signs of choroidal neovascularization&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Documented subfoveal fluid by OCT&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Active leak associated with the subfoveal fluid&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The ability and willingness to provide written informed consent&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prior treatment with laser or PDT&#xD;

          -  Any other additional ocular diseases which could irreversibly compromise the visual&#xD;
             acuity of the study eye including amblyopia, anterior ischemic optic neuropathy&#xD;
             (AION), age related macular degeneration (AMD), retinal detachment, severe cataracts,&#xD;
             etc.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  An anticipated need for ocular surgery during the duration of the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Within 1 month prior to screening, have had intra ocular surgeries (including cataract&#xD;
             surgery) in the study eye.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Within 1 month prior to screening had YAG laser capsulotomy in the study eye&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have received any other systemic experimental drug within 12 weeks prior to&#xD;
             enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Rubeosis iridis or neovascular glaucoma&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any untreated rhegmatogenous retinal detachment.&#xD;
&#xD;
