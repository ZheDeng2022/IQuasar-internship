  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a pilot study that will focus on the collection of preliminary data to determine the&#xD;
      efficacy of quetiapine for individuals with social phobia. We hypothesize that individuals&#xD;
      will react with less self-reported anxiety and physiological reactivity in the drug condition&#xD;
      than in the placebo condition. If true, this would constitute a strong signal for a&#xD;
      significant treatment effect for quetiapine in social phobia. A positive treatment effect in&#xD;
      this study would provide rationale for further investigation of the efficacy of quetiapine&#xD;
      for cue reactivity for individuals with social phobia. Further study would include increased&#xD;
      sample size in order to obtain statistical power and replication of findings. We will utilize&#xD;
      the IR formulation of quetiapine.&#xD;

      Primary Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the use of quetiapine to diminish cue reactivity to&#xD;
      a Virtual Reality environment for individuals with Social Phobia. The following primary and&#xD;
      secondary outcome measures will be administered to subjects during each Virtual Reality&#xD;
      exposure in treatment and non-treatment conditions. The outcome measures have demonstrated&#xD;
      adequate reliability and validity in the detection of clinical change for individuals with&#xD;
      social phobia in open label studies using quetiapine (Schutters, van Megen, and Westenberg,&#xD;
      2005). The Personal Report of Confidence as a Speaker (PRCS; Paul, 1966) will be utilized as&#xD;
      the primary measure to establish individual diagnosis and severity level. Pertaub and Slater&#xD;
      (2002) demonstrated the sensitivity of the PRCS in measuring anxiety responses to virtual&#xD;
      audiences. A total score of 21 or greater on the PRCS will be required for study inclusion&#xD;
      (Carrigan and Levis, 1999). Carrigan and Lewis (1999) reported a mean score of 23.73 on the&#xD;
      30-item PRCS for individuals reporting fear of public speaking. Subjective units of distress&#xD;
      ratings and measures of blood pressure and heart rate will be obtained within session in&#xD;
      order to measure immediate changes in subject's cue reactivity to VRE stimuli. The outcome&#xD;
      measures include:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Measure: Personal Report of Confidence as a Speaker (PRCS)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Measures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale (LSAS) Clinical Global Impressions-Improvement Scale (CGI)&#xD;
      Brief Social Phobia Scale Social Phobia Inventory Fear of Negative Evaluation Scale Hamilton&#xD;
      Rating Scale for Anxiety In session-Subjective Units of Distress Blood Pressure and heart&#xD;
      rate monitored within session&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A crossover, double-blind within subjects design will be used. The two conditions are placebo&#xD;
      and drug prior to exposure to social anxiety cues in the virtual environment. Each subject&#xD;
      will be in both conditions over the course of two visits. Each subject will be in only one&#xD;
      condition on the first visit and will then cross-over to the other condition on the second&#xD;
      visit. Order will be counter-balanced across subjects. The treatment phase of the study will&#xD;
      include the two afore mentioned visits, totaling 60 minutes each. This will include the&#xD;
      treatment and pre-post assessment&#xD;
