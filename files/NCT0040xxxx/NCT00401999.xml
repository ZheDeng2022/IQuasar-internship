      This study will examine the relationship between variations in a gene called OPRM1 and the&#xD;
      response to alcohol. The OPRM1 (Mu-opioid Receptor-1) gene helps regulate brain pathways&#xD;
      involved in experiencing pleasure. Brain pathways use a chemical called dopamine. Different&#xD;
      forms of the OPRM1 gene may lead to differences in how dopamine is released and subsequently&#xD;
      to differences in a person's response to alcohol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy non-smokers between 21 and 45 years of age may be eligible for this study. Candidates&#xD;
      are screened with a medical and psychiatric history and physical examination, blood and urine&#xD;
      tests, and breathalyzer (breath alcohol test). A blood test is also done to determine the&#xD;
      variant of OPRM1 gene.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants undergo the following procedures in three study sessions:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Session 1&#xD;
&#xD;
      &quot; Breathalyzer test, urine test for illicit drugs and pregnancy test for women who can become&#xD;
      pregnant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      &quot; Insertion of catheters (plastic tubes) into a vein in one arm for infusing alcohol and into&#xD;
      the other arm for drawing blood samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
      &quot; Completion of questionnaires on how intoxicated the subject feels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      &quot; Blood draw for research studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      &quot; Eye movement test (a visor with a digital camera tracks the subject's eye movements while&#xD;
      he or she watches lights on a computer screen).&#xD;
&#xD;
      &quot; 45-minute alcohol infusion (up to 0,08 grams per deciliter - a level considered in most&#xD;
      states as driving under the influence of alcohol).&#xD;
&#xD;
      &quot; Repeat breathalyzer, questionnaires, eye movement test and blood draw every 15 minutes&#xD;
      during the infusion and again after the infusion is complete.&#xD;
&#xD;
      &quot; Subjects remain in the clinic until their blood alcohol content falls below 0.02 g/dL,&#xD;
      determined by a breathalyzer test done every 15 minutes. Subjects can usually return home&#xD;
      about 3 to 4 hours after the alcohol infusion stops.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sessions 2 and 3&#xD;
&#xD;
      The procedure is the same as for session 1, except subjects receive an infusion of alcohol&#xD;
      one session and an infusion of saline (salt water) the other. Also, subjects undergo positron&#xD;
      emission tomography (PET) scanning during the infusions. For this test, the subject lies on a&#xD;
      bed that slides in and out of a doughnut-shaped scanner. A custom-molded mask is used to&#xD;
      support the head and prevent it from moving during the scanning. A small amount of&#xD;
      radioactive substance called C-11 raclopride is injected through one of the catheters to&#xD;
      trace brain dopamine activity.&#xD;

      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Reinforcing properties of alcohol are in part mediated through endogenous opioids. Mesolimbic&#xD;
      dopamine (DA) release is a key signal for drug reward, and endogenous opioids are thought to&#xD;
      exert their effects by modulating the activity of this system. A functional mu-opioid&#xD;
      receptor (OPRM1) A118G single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) alters the affinity of the&#xD;
      mu-opioid receptor for its endogenous ligand, is in some studies associated with increased&#xD;
      risk for alcohol and heroin addiction, and confers differential pain sensitivity and&#xD;
      subjective responses to alcohol. This prompts the question whether the differential&#xD;
      subjective response to alcohol observed as a function of the OPRM1 A118G genotype reflects&#xD;
      differential activation of the mesolimbic DA release. The objective of this study is to&#xD;
      examine the role of the A118G OPRM1 polymorphism for responses to a highly standardized&#xD;
      intravenous alcohol challenge, with regard to psycho-physiological variables measured in the&#xD;
      laboratory, and for brain dopamine release measured by 11C raclopride PET.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population:&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will screen healthy participants from the general population to obtain samples of two&#xD;
      groups of subjects: 1) persons homozygous for the major 118A allele (118AA genotype); 2)&#xD;
      persons carrying one or two copies of the variant 118G allele (118AG or 118GG genotype,&#xD;
      hereafter called 118GX).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design and Outcome Measures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will compare the response of these groups to a standardized alcohol challenge using the&#xD;
      procedure in place for NIAAA protocols 03-AA-0283 Influence of Age and Gender on Alcohol&#xD;
      Metabolism and Acute Responses and 04-AA-0060 The Effect of Ethanol on Cerebral Blood Flow as&#xD;
      Measured by Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging and the Development of Conditioned Response&#xD;
      to Ethanol Administration . Participants will be given a standardized IV infusion of an&#xD;
      alcohol solution infused to achieve and maintain a target blood alcohol level of 80 mg%. Pre&#xD;
      and post infusion measures will be made in two areas: 1) subjective response as measured by&#xD;
      standardized questionnaires, and 2) measures of physiologic response, to include saccadic eye&#xD;
      movements and blood chemistries. We hypothesize that 118GX subjects will have significantly&#xD;
      higher subjective response to alcohol challenge than 118AA subjects. We will then repeat the&#xD;
      alcohol infusion procedure in all participants twice in the PET scanner, infusing alcohol or&#xD;
      saline, and assess displacement of 11C raclopride, a positron emitter labeled ligand which&#xD;
      binds preferentially to D2 receptors. We hypothesize that 118GX subjects will have more 11C&#xD;
      raclopride displacement after alcohol infusion relative to placebo, indicating greater&#xD;
      amounts of dopamine release.&#xD;
