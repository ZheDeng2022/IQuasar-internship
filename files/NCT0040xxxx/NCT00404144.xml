      The objective of this study is to assess the safety and efficacy of the Paclitaxel-eluting&#xD;
      PTCA-balloon catheter (3µg/mm2 balloon surface area) in the treatment of significant (≥ 70%&#xD;
      and &lt; 100 %) stenoses in native coronary arteries with reference diameters from 2.25 mm to&#xD;
      2.8 mm and ≤ 22 mm in length for procedural success and preservation of vessel patency.&#xD;

      Background information:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stent deployment for the treatment of coronary artery stenoses has evolved as the standard&#xD;
      treatment in nearly all types of coronary lesions over the past two decades. The initial&#xD;
      recurrence rate of bare stents in the range of 20 30 % in low risk stenoses has been further&#xD;
      reduced by devices with passive coatings such as silicon carbide, heparin, phosphorylcholine,&#xD;
      and carbon.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the percutaneous transluminal treatment of stenotic coronary arteries with diameters below&#xD;
      3 mm, however, none of the currently available methods, namely balloon angioplasty with&#xD;
      conventional balloons (POBA) and deployment of non-drug eluting stents have shown acceptable&#xD;
      results for the various reasons inherent to these approaches. Although some studies showed&#xD;
      POBA and the deployment of bare stents to be equally effective with respect to restenosis, in&#xD;
      a recently published meta-analysis of eleven trials the restenosis rates were as high as 25.8&#xD;
      % for POBA and 34.2 % for bare stents, respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Brachytherapy initially demonstrated encouraging results. However, due to its disadvantages&#xD;
      such as delayed endothelialization, the risk associated with additional stenting, the&#xD;
      cumbersome logistics at the sites and in the labs, brachytherapy is not considered as a valid&#xD;
      approach. Data with the Sirolimus-eluting Cypher™ stent in vessels averaging 2.60 ± 0.54 mm&#xD;
      in diameter showed the benefit of this cytostatic drug in this indication. However, this&#xD;
      approach introduces a layer of metal to the per se small vessel and, thus, reduces the&#xD;
      vascular lumen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Rationale:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since none of the above mentioned options for the percutaneous treatment of small vessel&#xD;
      coronary artery stenoses seems to be universally recommendable the Paclitaxel-eluting PTCA&#xD;
      balloon catheter has to be considered as an alternative. The possible advantages over either&#xD;
      the uncoated balloon or bare stent include the antiproliferative mode of action of the&#xD;
      compound. In comparison to the drug eluting stents (DES) the homogenous distribution of the&#xD;
      compound along the target vessel segment, the lack of chronic mechanical alteration of the&#xD;
      artery and the ease of access to the lesion would favor the Paclitaxel-eluting balloon.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, there are no data available on the use of the drug eluting balloons in small vessel&#xD;
      disease and the information on the other indication evaluated to date, the treatment of&#xD;
      in-stent restenosis is limited. In the latter indication, the animal model and according to&#xD;
      unpublished results in humans, the proliferation induced by a Paclitaxel-eluting balloon&#xD;
      catheter was significantly less compared to an uncoated balloon, the Paclitaxel-coated Taxus™&#xD;
      stent, and to the Sirolimus-eluting Cypher™ stent. Therefore, it is prudent to test the&#xD;
      Paclitaxel-eluting PTCA balloon catheter as an alternative approach for the percutaneous&#xD;
      transluminal treatment of small vessel coronary artery lesions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since none of the alternative methods has unequivocally shown its superiority over the other,&#xD;
      none of them may serve as the golden standard and, i.e., for direct comparison. Consequently,&#xD;
      as the initial step conducting a single arm study with the Paclitaxel-eluting balloon is&#xD;
      suggested with historic data serving for comparison. Once these results will have been&#xD;
      obtained a prospective randomized trial shall be discussed.&#xD;
