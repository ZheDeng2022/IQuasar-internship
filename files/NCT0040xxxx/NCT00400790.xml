  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: Different anaesthetic agents have been shown to have different protective effects&#xD;
      upon heart, brain and renal function under ischaemic conditions (oxygen starvation).&#xD;
      Cardiopulmonary bypass takes over the work of the heart and the lungs during heart surgery,&#xD;
      but oxygenation of vital organs such as the brain and heart may not be perfect, and can&#xD;
      produce brain or heart damage as a consequence. Propofol and desflurane are commonly used&#xD;
      anaesthetic agents, and there has been recent research to suggest that anaesthetic agents may&#xD;
      provide some protection during periods where inadequate oxygenation occurs, with the&#xD;
      potential to reduce the degree of organ damage. Both types of anaesthetics are used for&#xD;
      cardiac surgery with anaesthetists choosing between them largely on the basis of personal&#xD;
      preference.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim: To determine whether the use of either propofol or desflurane as the primary anaesthetic&#xD;
      agent, can lead to differences in postoperative brain function, total morbidity or cost,&#xD;
      following coronary artery surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: Patients will be recruited by professional research staff and will be randomised&#xD;
      into one of two groups (90 in each group). They will receive a standardized technique for&#xD;
      anaesthesia, cardiopulmonary bypass and postoperative ICU treatment. The only difference&#xD;
      between the 2 groups will be as to which anaesthetic agent they receive during the surgical&#xD;
      period, desflurane or propofol. Measurements will involve i) brain function testing before&#xD;
      and 3 months after surgery ( a set of 10 verbal or manual tests), ii) incidence of delirium&#xD;
      in the immediate postoperative period (a survey form), iii) incidence of total postoperative&#xD;
      morbidity and iv) cost of hospital stay. Data collection will be by anaesthesia and research&#xD;
      staff and a neuropsychologist will employed for performing the brain function testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anticipated timeline: Initial recruitment completed by 15-18 months following trial&#xD;
      commencement. Follow up completed 3 month after the last enrolment. Data validation,&#xD;
      statistical analysis and manuscript preparation completed by 24 months.&#xD;

      Aims To investigate whether there are differences in postoperative cognitive function, total&#xD;
      morbidity or cost, following cardiac surgery determined by the use of either propofol or&#xD;
      desflurane as the primary anaesthetic agent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis&#xD;
&#xD;
      The null hypothesis is that there are no differences in postoperative cognitive function,&#xD;
      total morbidity or economic cost based on the type of primary anaesthetic delivered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants: Following human ethics committee approval, and informed written consent, 180&#xD;
      patients undergoing elective cardiac surgery will be randomized to receive desflurane or&#xD;
      propofol as the primary anaesthetic agent during surgery. This will be conducted at the Royal&#xD;
      Melbourne Hospital. Data will be collected preoperatively, intraoperatively and throughout&#xD;
      the entire hospital stay, and including a three-month follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adult male and female patients aged 18 years or older, undergoing on-pump elective coronary&#xD;
      artery bypass surgery with general anaesthesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Off-pump cardiac surgery&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Require surgery for acute coronary syndrome&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Dialysis dependent renal dysfunction&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Severe liver dysfunction as determined by liver transaminases 1.5X greater than normal.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Pre-existing diagnosis of schizophrenia, dementia recent stroke or cognitive disorder&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Recent alcohol/drug abuse/intoxication&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Re-do Coronary Artery Grafts&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. Coronary Artery Grafts plus other surgery&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interventions&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will receive either propofol or desflurane as the primary anaesthetic agent for the&#xD;
      duration of this surgery. The following minor differences between groups are outlined:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. For anaesthesia induction, the desflurane group will receive inhalational sevoflurane,&#xD;
           as desflurane is pungent and irritant to the airway making inhalational induction of&#xD;
           anaesthesia difficult. Following induction of anaesthesia with sevoflurane, the&#xD;
           anaesthetic will be changed to desflurane at 0.5-2 MAC as necessary (this will include&#xD;
           desflurane administration during cardiopulmonary bypass via the oxygen inlet to the&#xD;
           circuit).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Patients in the propofol group will have general anaesthesia induced and maintained by&#xD;
           propofol (effect site steering using an Asena TCI pump and levels maintained from&#xD;
           1.5-3Âµg/ml using the Marsh pharmacokinetic profile). No volatile anaesthesic agent will&#xD;
           be allowed in this group including during CPB.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following anaesthesia, surgery, cardiopulmonary bypass, and sedation techniques will be&#xD;
      common for both groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Anaesthesia co-induction / sedation with fentanyl (2-5 ug/kg) and midazolam (0.025-&#xD;
           0.05mg/kg). Following induction of anaesthesia, patients will be maintained on a&#xD;
           combined intravenous infusion of fentanyl (1.5 ug/kg/hr) and midazolam (0.025-0.05&#xD;
           mg/kg/hr) with Fi02=1.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Anaesthesia monitoring: In addition to specified routine anaesthetic monitoring as per&#xD;
           Australian and New Zealand College of Anaesthetists guidelines for general anaesthesia&#xD;
           (38), all patients will have intra-arterial pressure monitoring, pulmonary artery (PA)&#xD;
           pressure monitoring, nasopharyngeal temperature monitoring and transoesophageal&#xD;
           echocardiography. These are standard monitoring for patients undergoing cardiac surgery&#xD;
           at the Royal Melbourne Hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Hemodynamic management: metaraminol or nitro-glycerin can be administered to control&#xD;
           systemic arterial blood pressure within a systolic arterial pressure range of 100-140&#xD;
           mmHg. Beta blockade can be used at the anaesthetists discretion for either haemodynamic&#xD;
           control, or management of ventricular arrhythmias.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Cardiopulmonary bypass: the venous reservoir of the cardiopulmonary bypass circuit will&#xD;
           be primed with 2L of crystalloid solution (Plasma-lyte(R) Baxter Healthcare) and&#xD;
           maintained at a temperature of 35 degrees Celsius. Cardiopulmonary bypass will be&#xD;
           performed in a standardized technique with cannulation of the ascending aorta and with a&#xD;
           single two-staged right atrial-caval cannula with non-assisted venous drainage. After&#xD;
           initiation of cardiopulmonary bypass the patient's nasopharyngeal temperature will be&#xD;
           allowed to drift progressively down to 34 degrees Celsius at which point it will be&#xD;
           maintained by a heat exchanger until rewarming is initiated. Patients' haemoglobin will&#xD;
           be maintained above 70 g/l. The ascending aorta will be cross-clamped and cardiac arrest&#xD;
           will be induced by administration of tepid blood cardioplegia at a temperature ranging&#xD;
           from 20-25 degrees Celsius. The ratio of blood to the initial crystalloid cardioplegia&#xD;
           required to achieve arrest will be 4:1 in order to obtain a potassium concentration in&#xD;
           the induction cardioplegia of at least 20 mmol/l. Arrest will be achieved by antegrade&#xD;
           administration of cardioplegia through an aortic root catheter, followed by retrograde&#xD;
           administration through a coronary sinus catheter. Left ventricular distension will be&#xD;
           monitored for by transoesophageal echocardiography. Further doses of maintenance&#xD;
           cardioplegia are given following completion of graft anastomoses. Rewarming of the&#xD;
           patient will commence at the beginning of the last distal anastomosis (or 15 minutes&#xD;
           prior to aortic cross clamp removal). The temperature of the heat exchanger used to&#xD;
           achieve this will not exceed 37 degrees Celsius. Atrial pacing wires will be attached if&#xD;
           electrical activity has not been established after 5 minutes of reperfusion or if&#xD;
           pre-operative heart rate is less than 60 per minute or if the patient is on B-adrenergic&#xD;
           antagonists. The patient will remain on full cardiopulmonary bypass support for a period&#xD;
           of time approximately equal to 20-25% of cross clamp time or until the anaesthetist,&#xD;
           perfusionist, and surgeon are satisfied that cardiac function is appropriate to achieve&#xD;
           separation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Post CPB hemodynamic management: Cardiac output will be measured by a thermodilution&#xD;
           technique. Dobutamine can be administered for low cardiac output (cardiac index less&#xD;
           than 2.0 L/min/m2) and noradrenaline can be used for low SVR syndrome if felt&#xD;
           appropriate by anaesthetist, surgeon, or intensivist concerned.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Postoperative sedation: following skin closure, all anaesthesia agents will be ceased. A&#xD;
           low dose propofol infusion will be permitted for postoperative ICU sedation until they&#xD;
           are suitable for extubation.The aim is for a Ramsay sedation score of 2 upon initial&#xD;
           return to ICU then once haemodynamically stable, to aim for a score of 4. Patients will&#xD;
           be escorted to the intensive care unit and will be ventilated until they have achieved&#xD;
           accepted standard criteria for extubation (awake and co-operative, warm,&#xD;
           haemodynamically stable, PaCO2&lt;50mmHg, PaO2&gt; 100 on FiO2 = 0.4). Patients will be&#xD;
           allowed to awaken in ICU and extubated.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Rescue protocol: In both groups additional rescue analgesia will be allowed in the form&#xD;
           of fentanyl, or morphine, paracetamol, tramadol, or indomethacin as necessary to provide&#xD;
           adequate analgesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Endpoints&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Endpoint - neurological protection 1. Neurocognitive function testing (preoperative,&#xD;
      prior to hospital discharge, and at 3 months postoperation)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Endpoints&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Delirium as assessed by confusion assessment method (CAM).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. In-hospital morbidity as determined by composite morbidity score&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tertiary endpoints&#xD;
&#xD;
      1. Cost of post-operative care&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following endpoints are cumulative and reported for the entire hospital stay:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Composite morbidity/mortality score This will be a weighted morbidity score. It will score 3&#xD;
      points for death, 2 points for a major morbid outcome and 1 point for any minor outcome.&#xD;
      Major morbid outcome is defined as any outcome that is permanent (e.g. stroke) or has a&#xD;
      natural history in that it could lead to death, but without actually causing death. It is&#xD;
      derived from morbidity likely to result from inadequate tissue perfusion or immunomodulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Economics Hospital economics will be assessed on multiple criteria;&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Time spent in ICU&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Time spent in hospital&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Cost of all blood products&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Re-operation&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Pathology and other investigations needed while in hospital&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Cost of drugs administered&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cost/economics estimations are taken from Australian published studies and index to 2006&#xD;
      prices. Investigation tests are based on rebates from the Medical benefit schedule. Both are&#xD;
      listed below. The cost of re-operation is based on theatre time for four hours indexed to&#xD;
      2006 prices, and do not include doctors fees. The number of hospital days which will be&#xD;
      charged as the hospital length of stay - ICU time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The actual cost of the operation are &quot;fixed costs&quot; (this only relates to the primary&#xD;
      operation and not to reoperations). The cost that we are looking at, therefore are&#xD;
      potentially variable costs which may be impacted upon by the possible use of volatile&#xD;
      anaesthesia, or propofol. Obviously a return to OR would involve costs involving OR time,&#xD;
      disposables including CPB circuits, and drugs (including aprotinin and recombinant factor&#xD;
      VIIa).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size Estimates of power and minimal group size were obtained by performing a forward&#xD;
      looking power analysis based upon the ability to show a significant difference in&#xD;
      neurocognitive testing. This is based on our previous study showing a 38% incidence of&#xD;
      neurocognitive abnormality in a group consistent with the propofol arm, and aiming for an&#xD;
      effect size reduction of 50%. For an 80% power to reject the null hypothesis of no&#xD;
      significance (P&lt;0.05) in each group, the sample size is 90 patients in each group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization The treating anaesthetist will allocate randomization by the sealed envelopes&#xD;
      method.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Implementation The patients will be recruited by professional research staff. Randomization&#xD;
      will be implemented by the treating anaesthetist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blinding The study will be open label for the treating anaesthetist who will also collect&#xD;
      intraoperative data, and patient (as they will either have an inhalational induction or an&#xD;
      intravenous induction, blinding is not possible), Preoperative and postoperative data will be&#xD;
      collected by professional research staff who will be blinded to the treatment protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical methods Continuous data collected over repeated measurement intervals will be&#xD;
      examined by repeated measures ANOVA and adjusted for multisample asphericity by applying the&#xD;
      Greenhouse Geisser correction. Categorical data will be analysed using Fischer's Exact test.&#xD;
      Data will be corrected for multiple comparisons within families of endpoints using the&#xD;
      Ryan-Holm Bonferroni correction. Intention to treat analysis will be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A blinded interim analysis of results will be performed by the data safety monitoring&#xD;
      committee upon conclusion of enrolment of 80 patients. Stopping values to terminate the study&#xD;
      will be set at a P value &lt; 0.001 for primary endpoints.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Timeline We anticipate initial recruitment will be complete 15-18 months following trial&#xD;
      commencement. Follow up will be complete 3 month after the last enrollment. Data validation,&#xD;
      statistical analysis and manuscript preparation will be complete by 24 months.&#xD;
