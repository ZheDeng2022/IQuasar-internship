      Intervention description:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Complementary Approaches to Lower Mean arterial pressure (CALM) is a multi dispensary program&#xD;
      aimed to reduce blood pressure in hypertensive patients. The program utilizes a naturopathic&#xD;
      dietary approach, education on cooking and food consumption choices, walking physical&#xD;
      exercise, Qi Gong - a form of Chinese slow movement exercise combined with relaxation&#xD;
      breathing and imagery and group therapy coaching in stress management techniques and&#xD;
      mind-body balancing techniques.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Trial Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To compare the effect of CALM in reducing blood pressure to the standard dietary DASH&#xD;
      approach in hypertensive patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology:&#xD;
&#xD;
      120 Participants will be randomly assigned in to two groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  CALM program for reducing blood pressure as the treatment group.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Standard DASH diet and lifestyle modification counseling as the control group. Inclusion&#xD;
           Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Adult men and women over 18 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients using anti hypertensive medications with mean systolic blood pressure&#xD;
           measurements of 120-180 mm Hg and/or mean diastolic measurements of 70-100 mm Hg as&#xD;
           determined by a 24 hour Holter test.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients not using anti hypertensive medications with mean systolic blood pressure&#xD;
           measurements of 130-180 mm Hg and or mean diastolic measurements of 80-100 mmHg.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Signed informed consent (appears in IRB forms)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessment of Efficacy Primary end point efficacy will be assessed by comparing the mean BP&#xD;
      measurements in the CALM group to the mean BP measurements in the DASH control group. Blood&#xD;
      pressure measurements will be performed by 24 hours Holter BP monitoring in the beginning and&#xD;
      at the end of the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary end points efficacy will be assed by comparing CALM to DASH programs with respect&#xD;
      to effects use of BP medications and weight loss. Lab test and pulse wave analysis will also&#xD;
      be assessed at the beginning and at the end of the study.&#xD;

      walking physical exercise, Qi Gong - a form of Chinese slow movement exercise combined with&#xD;
      relaxation breathing and imagery and group therapy coaching in stress management techniques&#xD;
      and mind-body balancing techniques.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Trial Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objective To compare the effect of CALM in reducing blood pressure to the standard&#xD;
      dietary DASH approach in hypertensive patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives To provide information on the efficacy of CALM in reducing weight and&#xD;
      improving quality of life. and to examine it's potential to indicate a dose reduction in&#xD;
      hypertensive medications. To evaluate CALM effects on cardiovascular disease risk factors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Trial Design&#xD;
&#xD;
      A single center parallel randomized control trial including two groups and enrolling 120&#xD;
      participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary End Point A comparable change in blood pressure measurements between CALM and DASH&#xD;
      groups after the 16 week period of the trial as measured by a 24 hour holter test which will&#xD;
      be performed in the beginning and the end of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary End Points&#xD;
&#xD;
      A comparable change in hypertensive medications A comparable change in weight reduction&#xD;
&#xD;
      Comparable changes in cardiovascular risk factors as indicated by following laboratory tests&#xD;
      and evaluations :&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arterial wall thickening , hemoglobin, hemoglobin A1c, creatinine, liver function parameters,&#xD;
      highly sensitive c-reactive protein (hsCRP), low density lipoprotein (LDL), high density&#xD;
      lipoprotein (HDL), triglycerides (TG), oxidized LDL (oxLDL), nitric oxide metabolites and&#xD;
      microalbumine/creatinine ratio.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology 120 Participants will be randomly assigned in to two groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  CALM program for reducing blood pressure as the treatment group.(As described below in&#xD;
           section 6)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Standard DASH diet and lifestyle modification counseling as the control group. (As&#xD;
           described below in section 6)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Duration of the study Group intervention in the treatment arm consists of 16 weeks of the&#xD;
      CALM program. Due to the limited number of participants we can allocate to each group, three&#xD;
      16 weeks cycles will be repeated in order to recruit the needed number of participants for&#xD;
      the trial. Thus the treatment phase is expected to last for 48 weeks. Recruitment is expected&#xD;
      to last about three months. An additional 6 months will be required for completion of data&#xD;
      entry and analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Location of the study The study will take place in Asaf Harofeh Medical Center, Israel and&#xD;
      will be conducted in Shiram - The Department of Integrated Medicine and in the Research and&#xD;
      Development Unit of Assaf Harofeh Medical Center.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment of the Subjects Patients will be recruited from the community and from Asaf&#xD;
      Harofeh medical center. Patients from a number of departments within the hospital will be&#xD;
      invited to participate in the study. An advertisement in the local newspaper and in the&#xD;
      medical center's web site will be published (appears in IRB forms) Recruitment will continue&#xD;
      until the overall quota of subjects (50 per group) will be met.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization Subjects will be randomly assigned to each treatment group utilizing a&#xD;
      computerized randomization system. A random list will be generated by the study statistician.&#xD;
      The random list will be kept in a sealed envelope in the study site. The list will be readily&#xD;
      available in case of any emergency.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow up Subjects will be assessed in the beginning and at the end of the trial and again 6&#xD;
      months later. Compliance questioners will be filled during several stages of the trial as&#xD;
      described in section 8 below.&#xD;

      Treatment of the subjects&#xD;
&#xD;
      The CALM group will receive a weekly 4 hour group coaching session for 16 weeks. Each session&#xD;
      will include the following parts:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. A group aerobic walking session. Participants will reach a target heart rate which will&#xD;
           be determined in advance as 60-75% of maximal heart rate expected for their age and with&#xD;
           accordance to their physical ability. The group walk will last for a maximum of one&#xD;
           hour. All participants will be encouraged to walk at least 3 times per week&#xD;
           independently.&#xD;
&#xD;
           .&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. A 1 hour weekly Qi Gong session. The class will include 45 minutes of slow movement&#xD;
           exercises emphasizing relaxation, abdominal breathing and visualization stretching and&#xD;
           meditation. A 15 minutes prerecorded guided imagery meditation aimed to reduce blood&#xD;
           pressure will be performed in a seated or supine position. Participants will be given a&#xD;
           CD with the 15 minutes mediation and will be encouraged to use it at home once a day.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Dietary counseling and cooking instructions for forming a healthy home cooking routine&#xD;
           which will be based on naturopathic rice diet approach. A group meal will be prepared by&#xD;
           participants in each session and participants will dine together. All participants will&#xD;
           be encouraged to follow the same diet at home.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Group therapy meeting focusing on stress management techniques and mind - body&#xD;
           balancing. Emphasis will be put on developing communication skills based on&#xD;
           nonjudgmental and empathic approaches, methods for dealing with stress and anxiety,&#xD;
           discarding low self esteem and negative thought patterns and developing positive&#xD;
           thinking patterns.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The DASH control group will receive group coaching sessions for 16 weeks. Each session will&#xD;
      include the following parts:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. A group aerobic walking session. Participants will reach a target heart rate which will&#xD;
           be calculated in advance as 60-75% of maximal heart rate expected for their age. The&#xD;
           group walk will last for a maximum of one hour. All participants will be encouraged to&#xD;
           walk at least 3 times per week independently.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Dietary counseling and cooking instructions according to a standard DASH diet. This will&#xD;
           include a diet rich in fruits, vegetables and low fat dairy products. A group meal will&#xD;
           be prepared by participants in each session and participants will dine together. All the&#xD;
           participant will be encouraged to follow the same diet at home.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessment of Efficacy&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary end point efficacy will be assessed by comparing the mean BP measurements in the CALM&#xD;
      group to the mean BP measurements in the DASH control group. Blood pressure measurements will&#xD;
      be performed by 24 hours Holter BP monitoring in the beginning and at the end of the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary end points efficacy will be assed by comparing CALM to DASH programs with respect&#xD;
      to effects use of BP medications and weight loss. Lab test and pulse wave analysis will also&#xD;
      be assessed at the beginning and at the end of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pulse wave analysis Assessment of arterial stiffness will be performed, at baseline, at the&#xD;
      end of 16 weeks of the trial and following 6 months, by a noninvasive technique using the&#xD;
      commercially available SphygmoCor System (AtCor Medical,LTD, Australia). All measurements&#xD;
      will be performed by S.E while the patient is in the recombinant position at room temperature&#xD;
      of 25oc. In brief, peripheral pressure waveforms will be recorded from the radial artery at&#xD;
      the wrist, using applanation tonometry with a high-fidelity micromanometer (Millar&#xD;
      Instruments). When 20 sequential waveforms will be recorded, a validated 16-18 generalized&#xD;
      transfer function will be applied to generate the corresponding central aortic pressure&#xD;
      waveform. Augmentation index (AIx) and augmented pressure (AP) were derived by calculation,&#xD;
      using pulse wave analysis technique. The merging point of the incident and the reflected wave&#xD;
      (the inflection point) will be identified on the generated aortic pressure waveform. AP will&#xD;
      be calculated as maximum systolic pressure minus pressure at the inflection point. AIx will&#xD;
      be calculated as AP divided by pulse pressure and expressed as percentage. Higher values of&#xD;
      AIx indicated increased wave reflection from the periphery or earlier return of the reflected&#xD;
      wave as a result of increased pulse wave velocity (attributable to increased arterial&#xD;
      stiffness), and vice versa. Only high-quality recordings, defined as those with in-device&#xD;
      quality index &gt;80% (as derived from an algorithm including average pulse height, pulse height&#xD;
      variations, diastolic variations, and the maximum rate of rise of the peripheral waveform)&#xD;
      and the curves acceptable upon a visual inspection performed by one investigator, will be&#xD;
      included in the analysis. All pulse wave measurements will be taken in the same sitting&#xD;
      position, in a quiet, temperature controlled room (23 ± 1°C), after at least 15 minute&#xD;
      resting period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Laboratory Tests At the beginning and at the end of the study, blood will be drawn for&#xD;
      measurement of hemoglobin, hemoglobin A1c, creatinine, liver function tests, highly sensitive&#xD;
      c-reactive protein (hsCRP) and lipid profile including total cholesterol high density&#xD;
      lipoprotein (HDL) and triglycerides (TG). LDL will calculated. Five cc of plasma will be&#xD;
      preserved in -70oc for future evaluation of oxidative stress (oxLDL, MDA) and NO.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Life Quality &amp; well being questioners Patients will fill the MOS 36 life quality&#xD;
      questionnaire in the beginning, at week 4, week 10 and at the end of the trial. In addition a&#xD;
      specific questionnaire for assessing dietary and cooking lifestyle will be filled in the&#xD;
      begging and at the end of the trial. These questionnaires will again be after six months for&#xD;
      the follow up period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Compliance Compliance questionnaires will address three topics: adherence to the diet&#xD;
      recommendations and cooking instructions at home, number of exercise sessions per week and&#xD;
      frequency of using the Qi Gong meditation disk at home. Questionnaires will be filled at the&#xD;
      end of weeks 4,10 &amp; 16 (end of trial) and at the follow up meeting post 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessment of Safety No adverse events or risks are expected for participants enrolled in&#xD;
      this trial. However, initially, the strict dietary program may influence the participants&#xD;
      overall energy level. Transient symptoms such as dizziness and headaches may also present in&#xD;
      early stages of the study participants will be couched in advance on how to maintain any&#xD;
      undesired influences. Nevertheless, any adverse event will be reported on the Adverse Event&#xD;
      Form along with the probability of the adverse event being study-related.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Decreasing doses or cessation of BP Medications use BP medication doses will be changed by&#xD;
      the primary investigator or by the patient healthcare physician. The physician in charge will&#xD;
      reduce BP lowering medications in case systolic blood pressure will decrease below 110 mmHg&#xD;
      or if participants will present symptoms of low blood pressure such as weakness, ortostatizm,&#xD;
      dizziness, presyncope or syncope. Before any change in BP lowering medications patients will&#xD;
      be encouraged to get another 24 hours holter of BP measurement test. All changes in BP&#xD;
      medications will be recorded.&#xD;
