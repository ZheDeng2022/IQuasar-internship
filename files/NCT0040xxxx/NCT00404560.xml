    <textblock>
      This screening study will examine the causes of immune disorders affecting white blood cells,&#xD;
      which defend against infections and will try to develop better means of diagnosis and&#xD;
      treatment of these immune disorders. This is a 2 visit screening study and patients&#xD;
      determined to be of interest for additional study or treatment will be asked to provide&#xD;
      consent for enrollment into an appropriate NIH follow up study. This study does not cover the&#xD;
      cost of the first visit to NIH for travel or lodgings but does cover the subsequent visit if&#xD;
      there is one. A financial assessment may determine if the patient is eligible for financial&#xD;
      assistance. This study does not enroll children under the age of 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients known to have or suspected of having increased susceptibility to infections and&#xD;
      their blood relatives may be eligible for this study, at the discretion of the principal&#xD;
      investigator. Patients and family members may undergo the following procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Personal and family medical history.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Physical examination and blood and urine tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Studies of breathing function (pulmonary function testing)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Dental examination.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Eye examination.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Genetic Testing&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Stored specimens for future analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Microscopic examination of saliva, wound drainage or tissues removed for medical reasons&#xD;
           for cell, hormone or DNA studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, patients will be asked to obtain permission for investigators to obtain their&#xD;
      medical records, previous test results, or radiographic studies prior to the first visit.&#xD;
      Patients will be asked to undergo imaging studies, such as a chest X-ray, CT scan or MRI&#xD;
      scan.&#xD;

      This screening study is designed to evaluate patients with suspected or identified recurrent&#xD;
      or unusual infections and their family members for clinical and in vitro correlates of&#xD;
      exposure and susceptibility. It will allow for up to 2 visits to obtain blood, urine, saliva,&#xD;
      stool, skin biopsy, or wound drainage from such patients or their family members for research&#xD;
      studies related to understanding the nature of the infection as well as the genetic and&#xD;
      biochemical bases of these diseases. Patients determined by initial evaluation to be of&#xD;
      interest for additional study or treatment will be asked to provide consent for enrollment&#xD;
      into an appropriate NIH follow-up study. The present study will enroll up to 2000 patients&#xD;
      and family members over the next 25 years.&#xD;

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        PATIENTS:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients known to have, or suspected of having an infection susceptibility and their&#xD;
             healthy blood relatives will be eligible for enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants must be over 1 month of age. There will be no limit as to sex, race or&#xD;
             disability.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have a primary physician outside of the NIH and may be required to&#xD;
             submit a letter from their physician that documents their relevant health history.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The participant or the participant's guardian will be willing and capable of providing&#xD;
             informed consent after initial counseling by clinical staff. Separate consent forms&#xD;
             for all interventional procedures will be obtained after explanation of the specific&#xD;
             procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients and relatives must agree to have blood and tissue stored for future studies&#xD;
             of the immune system and/or other medical conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients and relatives may be concurrently enrolled on other protocols as long as the&#xD;
             Principal Investigator is informed.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The patient must be enrolled on this protocol to have relatives enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
        The patient and patient relative cohorts will include the following special populations:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Children: Children are included in this study because immune defects may present in&#xD;
             early childhood, and early diagnosis or characterization may benefit subjects.&#xD;
             Children who do not meet the age and weight criteria for care at the Clinical Center,&#xD;
             may have sample collection only.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Decisionally impaired adults: Patients and patient relatives will be able to provide&#xD;
             informed consent for themselves or, if they lack the capacity to provide informed&#xD;
             consent, the study team will obtain consent from the legally authorized&#xD;
             representative. Patients with underlying immune disorders, autoimmune phenomena or&#xD;
             severe infections may sometimes present with delirium, encephalopathy, or coma and are&#xD;
             therefore unable to provide informed consent. Excluding patients who are unable to&#xD;
             provide consent could adversely impact patient access to medical therapy at the NIH as&#xD;
             well as adversely impact research recruitment. Excluding patients unable to provide&#xD;
             consent would also essentially prohibit us from evaluating patients at higher risk for&#xD;
             adverse outcomes and therefore skew our understanding of disease. Similarly, enrolled&#xD;
             patient subjects who lose the ability to provide ongoing consent during study&#xD;
             participation may continue in the study. The risks and benefits of participation for&#xD;
             subjects unable to consent should be identical to those described for less vulnerable&#xD;
             patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. A well understood acquired abnormality which leads to infection susceptibility, such&#xD;
             as HIV, cytotoxic chemotherapy, or active malignancy may be adequate explanation for&#xD;
             the infection diathesis. These may be grounds for exclusion if, in the opinion of the&#xD;
             investigators, the presence of such disease process interferes significantly with&#xD;
             evaluation (applicable to patients and their blood relatives).&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Severe or uncommon infections or syndromes often require highly specialized teams and&#xD;
             institutions. Some referred cases will not be able to be handled appropriately at the&#xD;
             NIH and may be deemed ineligible for admission, as determined by the Principal&#xD;
             Investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Pregnancy&#xD;
