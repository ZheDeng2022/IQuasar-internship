    <textblock>
      Background: The use of thiazide diuretics in the treatment of hypertension (HT) is widely&#xD;
      considered a first line treatment, given the efficacy and low cost of this class of drugs.&#xD;
      This indication is not unanimous, because thiazides can cause metabolic alterations and other&#xD;
      side effects increasing cardiac and cerebrovascular risk, which reduce compliance to&#xD;
      treatment and increase health care system cost. However, large intervention trials in HT&#xD;
      suggest that the improvement in cardiovascular prognosis of HT patients depends more on&#xD;
      follow-up procedures than on type of drug used. Furthermore, the investigators have&#xD;
      documented improved compliance to antihypertensive therapy by implementing cooperation&#xD;
      between general practitioners (GPs) and HT specialists.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives: In a multicenter, open label randomized study the investigators will compare the&#xD;
      persistence on therapy of thiazides versus other treatments, as a first line antihypertensive&#xD;
      therapy, in a clinical setting characterized by a strict cooperation between GPs and HT&#xD;
      specialist. The investigators will also analyse candidate genes with impact on drug-induced&#xD;
      metabolic alterations to elucidate the pathophysiology of these phenomena.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: 260 GPs will recruit 2600 hypertensive patients with indication to pharmacological&#xD;
      treatment and randomise them to starting treatment with chlortalidone (12.5 to 25 mg daily,&#xD;
      1300 pts) or a GP decided single drug (excluding thiazides) or combination therapy at highest&#xD;
      tolerated dose. In both groups any other class of antihypertensive drugs can be added over&#xD;
      time in order to achieve blood pressure control (&lt;140/90 mmHg). Follow-up will last 2 years.&#xD;
      Blood sample and urine analyses, carotid and cardiac ultrasound will be performed at baseline&#xD;
      and scheduled time points. Genotyping will be performed by sequencing. Data will be collected&#xD;
      and stored using a web based centralized Case Report Form (CRF) Expected results: Results&#xD;
      will highlight whether a follow-up strategy based on tight cooperation between GPs and HT&#xD;
      specialists can allow the use of thiazides as first line antihypertensive therapy without any&#xD;
      negative effect on persistence, adherence and efficacy of the treatment. These data can be&#xD;
      used to reduce total burden of the Health Care System in HT by replacing more expensive drugs&#xD;
      with diuretics in the 50% of hypertensive patients, who do not receive this class of drugs.&#xD;
      Furthermore, the pharmacogenetic approach may clarify the pathophysiological mechanisms of&#xD;
      drug-induced metabolic side effects&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Background and rationale&#xD;
&#xD;
      Many comments have been issued about similarities and differences between 2003 American and&#xD;
      European guidelines for the management of arterial hypertension (1,2), especially after the&#xD;
      publication of the Antihypertensive and Lipid-Lowering Treatment to Prevent Heart Attack&#xD;
      Trial (ALLHAT) study (3-5). Both guidelines agree that the majority of hypertensive patients&#xD;
      require more than one medication to achieve optimal blood pressure control and, consistent&#xD;
      with the most recent findings, the need of expensive, large clinical trials to demonstrate&#xD;
      the superiority of one medication on another is probably over (3,6). What is clear now is&#xD;
      that blood pressure must be optimally controlled to reduce risk of cardiovascular mortality&#xD;
      and morbidity in population, no matter which combination of medications is used. Comparison&#xD;
      between single medications is substantially academic and conceals the reality: in all trials,&#xD;
      in most circumstances comparison is between combinations, more than single medications. In&#xD;
      the Losartan Intervention for Endpoint Reduction Study (LIFE study) (6), for instance, there&#xD;
      has been a comparison between the combination of losartan with low dose hydrochlorothiazide&#xD;
      versus the combination of atenolol with the same diuretic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The difference between the seventh Joint National Committee (USA) on Prevention, Diagnosis&#xD;
      and Management of Hypertension (JNC VII) and European Society of Cardiology (ESC) and&#xD;
      European Society of Hypertension (ESH) 2003 guidelines, often presented as substantial, is in&#xD;
      the priority that Americans still give to the diuretic therapy, consistent with the most&#xD;
      waited results of the ALLHAT (3).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The ALLHAT was a randomized, double-blind, multicenter clinical institutional trial, entirely&#xD;
      sponsored by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) (3), and designed to&#xD;
      determine whether occurrence of fatal or nonfatal coronary heart disease is lower for high&#xD;
      risk hypertensive patients treated with amlodipine, lisinopril, doxazosin, or chlorthalidone.&#xD;
      The protocol was also approved by an independent Review Committee external to the NHLBI (7).&#xD;
      The ALLHAT recruited 9,000-15,000 participants/intervention arm (total: 33,357), and the&#xD;
      follow-up was quite long (4-8 years). The doxazosin arm was closed prematurely because of&#xD;
      higher mortality (8). Despite a number of important limitations of this study (4,9), the&#xD;
      overall impact of its findings remains very high.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The baseline characteristics of the ALLHAT participants were substantially similar in the 3&#xD;
      arms completing the study. Chlortalidone was significantly more effective than both&#xD;
      amlodipine and lisinopril in achieving optimal control of blood pressure at year 1 and year 2&#xD;
      and more effective than lisinopril in blood pressure control at year 3, 4 and 5 (all&#xD;
      p&lt;0.001). Consistent with the better control of blood pressure, chlortalidone tended to&#xD;
      provide a 10% more protection for combined fatal and non fatal coronary heart disease than&#xD;
      lisinopril whereas protection was similar for amlodipine, though this protection was less&#xD;
      evident than the superiority in controlling blood pressure. In fact, the difference in risk&#xD;
      profile versus the lisinopril arm achieved statistical significance only for elderly and&#xD;
      African-American participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Another relevant finding from the ALLHAT concerns the incidence of congestive heart failure&#xD;
      that was substantially less with chlortalidone than with either amlodipine or lisinopril.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are many recurrent criticisms to all trials showing the superiority of diuretics over&#xD;
      other medications in controlling blood pressure. First of all, worsening of glucose&#xD;
      metabolism, due to thiazide effects, is matter of concern (4,14-18). Also the ALLHAT authors&#xD;
      report a higher incidence of diabetes in the diuretic group which, however, did not affect&#xD;
      the outcome results (3). However, this concern is also sustained by recent evidence of the&#xD;
      dangerous effect of incident diabetes in patients with arterial hypertension (15).&#xD;
&#xD;
      One factor that might aggravate glucose metabolism during therapy with diuretics is the&#xD;
      underestimated effect of hypokalemia, which interferes with glucose-stimulated insulin&#xD;
      release, a condition that might be aggravated by association with beta-adrenergic block&#xD;
      (19,20). Among other beneficial effects, including improvement in blood pressure control,&#xD;
      correction of hypokalemia prevents or significantly reduces thiazide-induced hyperglycemia&#xD;
      (21-24). It is possible that low-dose potassium-sparing diuretics by preventing hypokaleemia&#xD;
      might also prevent metabolic effects of thiazide, at the same time enhancing the&#xD;
      antihypertensive effects of thiazide (25), but, this hypothesis has never been tested in ad&#xD;
      hoc trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The second concern about the use of diuretics is the risk of low therapeutic compliance of&#xD;
      hypertensive patients, due to the diuretic effect and other hypokalemia-related side-effects&#xD;
      (26,27). These few reports, however, contrast with the evidence that quality of life is&#xD;
      improved by long term therapy with diuretics (28-30). The effort, therefore, should probably&#xD;
      be direct toward persistence of initial treatment with diuretics, a goal that might be&#xD;
      reached by improving the procedures of follow-up, for instance, as we have recently proposed,&#xD;
      by implementing internet-based digital networks, connecting hypertension specialists with&#xD;
      general practitioners (31). The Campania Salute (CS)network is a system that was set up in&#xD;
      1995 by us (31). It is an italian regional network system aimed at improving the management&#xD;
      of essential hypertension by integrating the activity of general practitioners (GPs) with&#xD;
      hypertension specialists. This network includes about 12.000 hypertensive patients followed&#xD;
      by 23 outpatient hypertensive clinics allocated in different Community Hospitals in the&#xD;
      Campania Region and 60 GPs, homogeneously allocated in the regional area, referring to the&#xD;
      Hypertension Clinic of Federico II University Hospital in Naples (coordinating centre). GPs&#xD;
      were randomly selected among a pool of physicians referring their patients to the&#xD;
      Hypertension Clinic at Federico II University. Through the CS system clinical data detected&#xD;
      at each visit can be shared between the coordinating center and the peripheral units.Low-risk&#xD;
      hypertensive patients continue their follow up in the peripheral units, whereas high-risk&#xD;
      hypertensive patients are more closely followed up by the coordinating centre, which also&#xD;
      evaluates target organ damage and associated diseases. Patients' information is shared&#xD;
      through on-line access to the remote database, integrated by smartcards. The smartcard&#xD;
      belongs to patients and contains his/her personal identification number (PIN). This PIN&#xD;
      allows users to access the file of the patient stored in the database. Each physician has&#xD;
      also his own PIN to access into the database, limited to his/her own patient files. Clinical&#xD;
      data are upgraded at each visit by GPs and physicians of both peripheral centres and&#xD;
      coordinator centre. Access to the remote database allows users to read all clinical and&#xD;
      laboratory data, as well as tracking electrocardiography (ECG) and cardiac and vascular&#xD;
      ultrasound images. In addition, the smartcard also works as portable database in which&#xD;
      identification and clinical data are reported. By virtue of a central database, data of&#xD;
      individual patients can be stored, updated and retrieved directly on-line by participants in&#xD;
      the project. The restricted access to individual data requires the pre-assigned&#xD;
      identification code of both the patient and the relevant remote units. The central database&#xD;
      uses Wincare software (TSD Projects, Milan, Italy) which contains separate sheets for medical&#xD;
      history, physical examination, biochemistry electrocardiography, cardiovascular ultrasound,&#xD;
      other imaging tests and ambulatory blood pressure monitoring. The last update of an&#xD;
      individual patient's record can also be downloaded and stored in the patient's personal&#xD;
      smartcard. We started the CS project with the aim of obtaining a stronger interaction between&#xD;
      GPs and hypertension clinics, by providing a direct link and accessible patients' records.&#xD;
      Blood pressure control was improved with our referral system, since better overall results&#xD;
      were obtained if the patient was followed within the network. Indeed, at the end of the&#xD;
      observation period, 51% of patients in the CS group had a blood pressure below 140/90 mmHg, a&#xD;
      percentage comparable to that of patients included in clinical trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This follow-up strategy also allowed an active pharmacovigilance procedure, with side effects&#xD;
      promptly reported to the GPs, which prevented the occurrence of difference in compliance&#xD;
      among the various antihypertensive treatments. In addition, this kind of follow-up allowed by&#xD;
      means of pharmacogenetic studies to demonstrate that the occurrence of side effects may be&#xD;
      predicted from individual genotype (32). Indeed, we have recently reported that in patients&#xD;
      bearing β2AR gene Glu27 variant or the β3AR gene Arg64 variant there was a larger occurrence&#xD;
      of hypertriglyceridemia, alone or in combination with elevated cholesterol levels.&#xD;
      Furthermore, the β2AR Glu27variant significantly associates with hypetriglyceridemia in a&#xD;
      cumulative fashion. The risk of developing this side effect after β-blockade was four-fold&#xD;
      higher in patients homozygous for the β2AR Glu27 variant than in β2AR27Gln allele. This&#xD;
      result not only allowed the identification of patients at high risk to develop metabolic&#xD;
      complications to chronic β-blockade treatment, but also contributed to elucidate the&#xD;
      pathophysiological mechanisms which mediate these side effects, raising the possibility to&#xD;
      prevent them.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives of the study&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study has been designed to assess whether a follow-up strategy based on a strict&#xD;
      cooperation between GPs and hypertension specialists allows the use of diuretics as&#xD;
      first-line antihypertensive treatment with a persistence on assigned therapy equivalent to&#xD;
      that achieved by using any other first line antihypertensive therapy. Assessment of safety&#xD;
      and efficacy for controlling cardiovascular risk will be also performed as secondary&#xD;
      endpoint. In fact, in contrast with trials comparing single-drug effects, this study compares&#xD;
      two strategies of antihypertensive management, based on either real-word prescriptions or a&#xD;
      regimen in which thiazide diuretics represent a forced first line antihypertensive therapy.&#xD;
      If our hypothesis will be demonstrated diuretics might be suggested as an efficient and&#xD;
      economic first line antihypertensive treatment, on which build up optimal antihypertensive&#xD;
      therapy by adding other class drugs, in all patients, provided that the follow-up procedure&#xD;
      is based on the proposed organization. This approach will be of great utility for the&#xD;
      National Health Care System to reduce costs, since, a large part of the economic burden is&#xD;
      related to the use of antihypertensive medications more expensive than thiazides, as first&#xD;
      line agents, in particular so far only 40% of the hypertensive patients receive diuretics in&#xD;
      their therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Finally, the pharmacogenetic study is focused on characterization of polymorphisms of&#xD;
      candidate genes associated to development of metabolic side effects of diuretics, to help&#xD;
      understanding of mechanisms underlying these adverse events. This kind of information will&#xD;
      help to prevent the occurrence of adverse events by the use of adeguate combination&#xD;
      treatment, thus resulting in the further reduction of the cost of antihypertensive treatment&#xD;
      due to the reduction of the number of patients that discontinue therapy for occurrence of&#xD;
      adverse events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a multicenter, open label, randomized study to compare the effects of an&#xD;
      antihypertensive strategy using a thiazide diuretic as first-line, versus the use as initial&#xD;
      therapy of other antihypertensive treatments. All the analyses will be performed by personel&#xD;
      blinded to treatment. The study will be performed in collaboration with the Società Italiana&#xD;
      Medicina Generale (SIMG), Sezione Campania, and the Società Italiana Ipertensione Arteriosa&#xD;
      (SIIA), Sezione Campania.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population. The recruitment phase will last 8 months. During this period 2600 patients&#xD;
      will be enrolled, in the offices of 260 GPs' with documented previous experience in&#xD;
      controlled studies, performed according to recommendations of Good Clinical Practice, and&#xD;
      availability to access to Internet. Selected GPs will be trained to the use of the web-based&#xD;
      database on which they will store the required information of patients participating into the&#xD;
      study. This training period will last a week and will be supervised by the coordinator's&#xD;
      center. Exemplificative print outs of the web-based CRF are available for evaluation on the&#xD;
      web site www.campaniasalute.it.&#xD;
&#xD;
      GPs are required: 1) to record a full medical history, including smoking and drinking habits,&#xD;
      based on a pre-defined clinical record; 2) to collect demographic and anthropometric measures&#xD;
      (height, weight, waist circumference at the iliac crest); 3) to perform a complete physical&#xD;
      exam. At baseline and at each visit thereafter, seated office blood pressure will be measured&#xD;
      in triplicate using a manual sphygmomanometer according to international guidelines.&#xD;
      Measurements will be rounded to the closest 2 mmHg interval.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria: Hypertensive patients will be 18 to 75-year old. Eligible patients are&#xD;
      required to have stage Ic or II essential hypertension, and to be previously untreated or&#xD;
      poorly controlled. They will be selected by GPs participating into the study. Similar to&#xD;
      untreated patients, those with poor control of blood pressure under multiple-drug therapy&#xD;
      will start treatment with one single drug, which will be titrated to the highest dose before&#xD;
      adding subsequent medications, based on the GP's judgement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypertension will be defined according to 2003 ESH/ESC guidelines (1). Blood and urine tests&#xD;
      will be performed, according to guidelines for Hypertension Management For General&#xD;
      Practitioners (GP) of the Regione Campania (see Bollettino Ufficiale Regione Campania, number&#xD;
      11, 18/02/2002, allegato A). This screening includes cell blood counts (CBCs), serum&#xD;
      creatinine, sodium, potassium, uric acid, total cholesterol, triglycerides, HDL-cholesterol,&#xD;
      glucose, urine analysis and EKG. LDL will be calculated starting from the total cholesterol,&#xD;
      triglyceride and HDL-cholesterol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria. Women in fertile age not using recognized contraceptive methods, or&#xD;
      pregnant or nursing will be excluded from the protocol, since the use of many&#xD;
      antihypertensive drugs is contraindicated in pregnancy and lactation. Patients will be&#xD;
      excluded when presenting with documented coronary or cerebrovascular events in the previous 6&#xD;
      months, NYHA class higher than 1, history of congestive heart failure, secondary&#xD;
      hypertension, cancer disease, renal disease (serum creatinine &gt;2 mg/dl), liver cirrhosis or&#xD;
      severe dysfunction, or any other health problem that may interfere with the projected 2 year&#xD;
      follow-up. Data will be stored in an electronic database located in the Coordinating Centre,&#xD;
      to which GPs may have access for uploading data on a daily base, using personal, encrypted,&#xD;
      login and password. Eligible patients will be asked for written informed consent and&#xD;
      thereafter referred to the identified Hypertension Specialist Centre located in their areas,&#xD;
      for end-organ damage evaluation by echocardiography, carotid ultrasound and urine dip-stick.&#xD;
      These data will be stored in the central database. After local echocardiographic evaluation,&#xD;
      patients showing left ventricular Ejection Fraction &lt; 45% will be excluded from the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible patients will be asked for blood sampling for genomic DNA analysis and then&#xD;
      randomised by the coordinating centre to either diuretics or other treatment. This latter&#xD;
      will be decided by the GPs. Randomization will be organized in permuted blocks of 10 patients&#xD;
      for each GP, half of which will be assigned to diuretics. The randomization code will be&#xD;
      communicated to the referring GP by e-mail.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood samples for genetic analysis and signed informed consents will be sent to the&#xD;
      coordinating centre for storage. Blood samples will be coded and anonymously processed for&#xD;
      genetic analysis by the Department of Pharmacology of FEDERICO II University of Naples. The&#xD;
      data resulting from this analysis will be stored in the patient CRF page.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention: Drugs will be administered orally. GPs should use chlortalidone (12.5-25 mg&#xD;
      daily) in the arm with compulsive thiazide diuretic as first line. In the alternative arm,&#xD;
      GPs may choose any appropriate single-drug (excluding thiazide diuretic) or combination&#xD;
      therapy, as first-line, at the tolerated dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After randomization, patients will be evaluated monthly at the GPs' office, for therapy&#xD;
      adjustment, to achieve blood pressure normalization (i.e Systolic Blood pressure &gt;140 mmHg,&#xD;
      and Diastolic Blood pressure &gt;90 mmHg). In the thiazide arm, if blood pressure normalization&#xD;
      is not achieved not even with the maximal dose, it will be possible to add any other classes&#xD;
      of antihypertensive drugs. Once blood pressure normalization is achieved, GPs will monitor&#xD;
      blood pressure once every 2 months, at the renewal of the drug prescription. Blood pressure&#xD;
      values will be stored in the central database. At each visit, GPs will record drug therapy,&#xD;
      including concomitant medications, evaluate the compliance to assigned antihypertensive&#xD;
      regimen, and monitor and record adverse events by reporting all data in the CRF. After two&#xD;
      years from randomization, patients will be checked for blood and urine tests and referred to&#xD;
      the Hypertension Specialist Centre for echocardiography, carotid ultrasounds and urine&#xD;
      dip-stick. This data will be stored in the central database.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Information retrieval: At each visit, the GPs will record drug therapy, including concomitant&#xD;
      medications, will evaluate the compliance to the assigned antihypertensive medications by&#xD;
      pill count, and will monitor and record adverse events by reporting all data in the CRF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pre clinical cardiovascular disease will be assessed by echocardiography and carotid&#xD;
      ultrasonography. All ultrasound exams will be sent to the Reading Center at Federico II&#xD;
      University Hospital and will be processed, according to procedures described in the annex.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Monitoring of the study: All data will be reported on a specifically designed electronic&#xD;
      clinical research form (CRF) (see web site: www.campaniasalute.com), and will be transferred&#xD;
      to the Coordinating Center for data storage and analysis. The Steering Committee will appoint&#xD;
      a Data Coordinating Committee to evaluate all CRFs on a continuous way to ensure quality and&#xD;
      objectivity of the analysis performed by trained professionals. In order to monitor for&#xD;
      patient security, GPs will be asked to actively monitor periodically for adverse events, by&#xD;
      asking patients at the time of drug prescription renewal for the occurrence of symptoms or&#xD;
      signs that can be related to aggravation of their condition or adverse events of therapy. In&#xD;
      selected cases, GPs can refer the patients to the Hypertension Specialist Centre for eventual&#xD;
      instrumental and or blood and urinary analyses. Adverse events will be reported in the&#xD;
      digital CRF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size estimate: The main outcome to be tested is whether persitance on therapy of an&#xD;
      antihypertensive regimen based on diuretics as first choice is equivalent to that obtained in&#xD;
      a free regimen using any other antihypertensive medication as first choice (equivalence&#xD;
      study).&#xD;
&#xD;
      As secondary outcomes, reduction of left ventricle (LV) mass and carotid intima-media&#xD;
      thickness will be evaluated as markers of preclinical cardiovascular disease, under the&#xD;
      hypothesis that improvement of end-organ damage under diuretic-based treatment will not be&#xD;
      different from the treatment based on other antihypertensive medications (equivalence). The&#xD;
      reduction of the ESH/ESC risk-score will also be evaluated, under the same equivalence&#xD;
      hypothesis. Sample size was primarily estimated for the primary outcome, but afterward tested&#xD;
      on power also on secondary outcomes. See Annex for details&#xD;
&#xD;
      Organizational characteristics: The study will be governed by a Steering Committee chaired by&#xD;
      the Principal Investigator (Prof. Bruno Trimarco). The study will be performed as a&#xD;
      collaborative effort of 260 general practitioners (with previous experience in scientific&#xD;
      initiatives), specialist centers (Community Hospitals and University Hospitals in which&#xD;
      specialized evaluation of hypertension related organ damage is routinely evaluated). The&#xD;
      Department of Medicina Clinica, Scienze Cardiovascolari ed Immunologiche, division of&#xD;
      Coronary Intensive Care Unit and High Blood Pressure Center will act as a Coordinating&#xD;
      Center, run by Professor Trimarco, PI. The central database will be stored at this center,&#xD;
      and the other specialist centers and GPs will have remote access to it through encrypted&#xD;
      login and password. The web-based access to the database has already been implemented at the&#xD;
      Coordinating Center, within the Campania Salute Project, a regional network of Community&#xD;
      Hospitals and GPs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Echocardiograms and carotid ultrasounds will be performed at the Federico II University&#xD;
      Hospital or in peripheral centers, under a standardized protocol, which will be distributed&#xD;
      in an electronic format (CD-ROM). All studies will be directly transmitted through the&#xD;
      Internet to the Reading Center.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Feasibility: The Principal Investigator, Bruno Trimarco, has a long and extensive experience&#xD;
      in running trials of antihypertensive treatment and management of hypertension (see CV). As&#xD;
      Director of the Coordinating Institution he will personally assure full support of the&#xD;
      institution facilities, and of professional help in monitoring and statistics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Ultrasound Reading Center has wide experience in centralized reading of studies on LV&#xD;
      hypertrophy and function as well as in studies on arterial structure and has been involved in&#xD;
      a number of international multicenter trials (35,40). The Reading Center is provided of 4&#xD;
      work stations for echocardiographic reading and 2 for carotid ultrasound, with high level of&#xD;
      security for preservation of data and privacy. All echocardiograms will be classified with a&#xD;
      reception number which will join the recruitment number of the participant (every&#xD;
      participants will have 2 identification numbers in addition to the number of identification&#xD;
      document).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Timing: The study will last 3 years. The first eigth months will be spent for recruitment and&#xD;
      randomization. The follow-up will last 2 years. Analysis of data will be performed ad&#xD;
      interim, as soon as the last recruited patient completes the intermediate evaluation after&#xD;
      one year of follow-up. Final main analysis will be performed right after the conclusion of&#xD;
      follow-up of the last recruited patient. A number of analysis concerning secondary end-points&#xD;
      and including every ancillary study that might be proposed from the Steering Committee or the&#xD;
      participating Hypertension Specialist Centres, will be implemented thereafter.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethical aspects. We have tried to minimize possible therapy related side effects to those&#xD;
      that are usually observed in the practical clinic. Indeed, all treatments and dosages are&#xD;
      those that are usually adopted by general practitioner for the daily practice. Therefore, we&#xD;
      do not expect any additional risk for patients that are enrolled in the study. The&#xD;
      complications that are associated to thiazide treatment will be prevented by the use of&#xD;
      maximal doses that are in the low range of therapeutic effect, and close to the regimen that&#xD;
      currently used in daily practice. As for intromission in the private sphere of the patients,&#xD;
      the data will be nominally entered in the database by the physician using a login/password&#xD;
      protected web-based 32bit encrypted connection, and available only for this research purposes&#xD;
      after given informed consent by the patients.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Hypertensive patients will be 18 to 75-year old.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Eligible patients will be asked for written informed consent and thereafter referred&#xD;
             to the identified Hypertension Specialist Centre located in their areas, for end-organ&#xD;
             damage evaluation by echocardiography, carotid ultrasound and urine dip-stick.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Eligible patients are required to have stage Ic or II essential hypertension, and to&#xD;
             be previously untreated or poorly controlled. They will be selected by GPs&#xD;
             participating into the study. Similar to untreated patients, those with poor control&#xD;
             of blood pressure under multiple-drug therapy will start treatment with one single&#xD;
             drug, which will be titrated to the highest dose before adding subsequent medications,&#xD;
             based on the GP's judgement.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Hypertension will be defined according to 2003 ESH/ESC guidelines (1). Blood and urine&#xD;
             tests will be performed, according to guidelines for Hypertension Management For&#xD;
             General Practitioners (GP) of the Regione Campania (see BURC number 11, 18/02/2002).&#xD;
             This screening includes cell blood counts (CBCs), serum creatinine, sodium, potassium,&#xD;
             uric acid, total cholesterol, triglycerides, HDL-cholesterol, glucose, urine analysis&#xD;
             and EKG. LDL will be calculated starting from the total cholesterol, triglyceride and&#xD;
             HDL-cholesterol.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Omen in fertile age not using recognized contraceptive methods, or pregnant or nursing&#xD;
             will be excluded from the protocol, since the use of many antihypertensive drugs is&#xD;
             contraindicated in pregnancy and lactation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients will be excluded when presenting with documented coronary or cerebrovascular&#xD;
             events in the previous 6 months, NYHA class higher than 1&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of congestive heart failure&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Secondary hypertension&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Cancer disease&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Renal disease (serum creatinine &gt;2 mg/dl)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Liver cirrhosis or severe dysfunction, or any other health problem that may interfere&#xD;
             with the projected 2 year follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Data will be stored in an electronic database located in the Coordinating Centre, to which&#xD;
        GPs may have access for uploading data on a daily base, using personal, encrypted, login&#xD;
        and password. These data will be stored in the central database. After local&#xD;
        echocardiographic evaluation, patients showing left ventricular Ejection Fraction &lt; 45%&#xD;
        will be excluded from the study.&#xD;
