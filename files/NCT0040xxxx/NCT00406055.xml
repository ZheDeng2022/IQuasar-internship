  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purposes of this study is to 1) Provide additional information that the commercially&#xD;
      available Abbott Vascular Carotid Stent Systems and Embolic Protection Systems can be used&#xD;
      successfully by a wide range of physicians under commercial use conditions. 2) Provide an&#xD;
      ongoing post-market surveillance mechanism for documentation of clinical outcomes and for&#xD;
      possible extension of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) coverage to a&#xD;
      broader group of patients.&#xD;

      The CHOICE study will provide a mechanism for collection of data from Abbott Vascular's&#xD;
      Carotid Stent Systems and Embolic Protection Systems when used by a broad group of physicians&#xD;
      under commercial use conditions. The original CAPTURE and EXACT studies had built-in features&#xD;
      that limited the ability to collect on-going real world data because they restricted the&#xD;
      number of sites that could participate (up to 150 sites) and limited enrollment at each site&#xD;
      (up to 50 patients per site). This study will not have these restrictions. The CHOICE study&#xD;
      will also provide an ongoing post-market surveillance mechanism for documentation of clinical&#xD;
      outcomes and for possible extension of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS)&#xD;
      coverage to a broader group of patients.&#xD;
