  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this phase 2 study is to determine if difluprednate ophthalmic emulsion is&#xD;
      effective in the treatment of postoperative inflammation.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The objective is to assess efficacy endpoints in comparison with 0.1% BM ophthalmic solution,&#xD;
      prior to investigation of the efficacy and safety of 0.05% DFBA ophthalmic emulsion in the&#xD;
      treatment of postoperative intraocular inflammation.&#xD;
