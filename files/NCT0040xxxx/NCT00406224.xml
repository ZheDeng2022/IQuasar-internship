  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background It has recently been shown that diffuse luminance flicker increases retinal and&#xD;
      optic nerve head blood flow. This indicates that a neuro-vascular coupling between neural&#xD;
      activity and blood flow exists as described previously for the brain. Although a lot of&#xD;
      mediators such as NO, pO2, pCO2, H+ and K+ have been proposed, the mechanism of this coupling&#xD;
      is still a matter of controversy. However, it has been shown in an animal experiment, that an&#xD;
      increase in blood flow, evoked by diffuse luminance flicker stimulation is paralleled by an&#xD;
      decrease in pO2 in the tissue. Thus, in this study we set out to investigate the flicker&#xD;
      light induced increase in blood flow under elevated blood pO2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study rationale The motive for the investigation of retinal blood flow regulation is to&#xD;
      enhance our understanding of the coupling mechanism between increased neural activity and&#xD;
      blood flow in the retina in order to gain new insight in the pathophysiology of several eye&#xD;
      diseases associated with ocular vascular disorders Study objectives To test the hypothesis&#xD;
      whether oxygen breathing influences flicker light induced changes in optic nerve head blood&#xD;
      flow&#xD;
