      The use of bisphosphonates during childhood to ameliorate the skeletal abnormalities&#xD;
      associated with osteogenesis imperfecta, idiopathic juvenile osteoporosis, fibrous dysplasia&#xD;
      of bone and cerebral palsy. There is paucity of long-term studies among children regarding&#xD;
      the safety and efficacy of bisphosphonates.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Osteomyelitis and necrosis of the jaws has been was discovered and reported as a serious&#xD;
      adverse event in bisphosphonate-treated adults patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To our knowledge, there is no report in the literature about osteomyelitis in children&#xD;
      treated with bisphosphonates and the influence of long term treatment with bisphosphonates on&#xD;
      children's jaws, the reaction to extractions and on the oral cavity.&#xD;

&#xD;
      Osteomyelitis and necrosis of the jaws has been was discovered and reported as a serious&#xD;

&#xD;
      To our knowledge, there is no report in the literature about osteomyelitis in children&#xD;
      treated with bisphosphonates and the influence of long term treatment with bisphosphonates on&#xD;
      children's jaws, the reaction to extractions and on the oral cavity Aim of the study: to&#xD;
      examine the influence in the oral cavity of bisphosphonate in children Materials and methods&#xD;
      Population: 50 children treated with bisphosphonate will be included in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following data will be recorded:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. age, gender, initial disease, age at diagnosis, additional diseases&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. duration and dosage of the bisphosphonate medication (kind of bisphosphonate, age at the&#xD;
           beginning of the drug treatment, duration of treatment, frequency of intake, additional&#xD;
           medications)&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Clinical dental examination was performed for detection of; caries, gingival&#xD;
           inflammation and oral hygiene, sequence of dental eruption, teeth extractions, and&#xD;
           presence of exposure bone.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Unstimulated whole saliva was collected using the spitting method as previously&#xD;
           described. Sialochemistry analysis will be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Serum analysis findings including: calcium (Ca), phosphorous (P), alkaline phosphatase&#xD;
           (AlP) and parathyroid hormone (PTH),vitamin D cross-linked telopeptides (ctx, ntx), bone&#xD;
           density. (these examination are performed routinely, in these patients, as part of&#xD;
           medical follow up.&#xD;
