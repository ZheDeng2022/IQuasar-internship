  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study we will examine where the radioactive tracer [11C]PBR28 is distributed in the&#xD;
      body of healthy volunteers to calculate the radiation exposure to organs of the body. We will&#xD;
      also test if [11C]PBR28 binds to your blood cells and compare with the binding in PET images.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The peripheral benzodiazepine receptor (PBR) is distinct from central benzodiazepine&#xD;
      receptors associated with GABA(A) receptors. Although PBR was initially identified in&#xD;
      peripheral organs such as kidneys, endocrine glands and lungs, later studies identified PBR&#xD;
      in the central nervous system. In normal conditions, PBR is expressed in low levels in some&#xD;
      neurons and glial cells. PBR can be a clinically useful marker to detect neuroinflammation&#xD;
      because activated microglial cells in inflammatory areas express much greater levels of PBR&#xD;
      than in microglial cells in resting conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PBR has been imaged with positron emission tomography (PET) using&#xD;
      [(11)C]1-(2-chlorophenyl-N-methylpropyl)-3-isoquinoline carboxamide (PK11195). However, this&#xD;
      classical ligand provides only low levels of specific signals and is not sensitive to detect&#xD;
      changes that occurred in vivo. Recently we developed a new ligand,&#xD;
      N-acetyl-N-(2-[(11)C]methoxybenzyl)-2-phenoxy-5-pyridinamine [(11)C]PBR28), which showed much&#xD;
      greater specific signals than [(11)C]PK11195 in non-human primates. Therefore, [(11)C]PBR28&#xD;
      is a promising PET ligand. However, radiation absorbed doses have not been estimated from&#xD;
      human whole body imaging.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The initial purpose of this protocol is to estimate radiation absorbed doses of [11C]PBR28 by&#xD;
      performing whole body imaging studies on ten healthy human subjects. The radiation absorbed&#xD;
      doses are required to apply this PET ligand in various neurological and psychiatric disorders&#xD;
      in the future.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Under the current and other protocols using [(11)C]PBR28, we found that some healthy subjects&#xD;
      and patients have very low to no binding of [(11)C]PBR28. We studied approximately 188&#xD;
      subjects in total under protocols using [11C]PBR28 and found that 8.5% (16/188) had almost no&#xD;
      binding of [(11)C]PBR28. Several published ligands have been tested and all of the tested&#xD;
      ligands recently developed show low affinity to a subset of humans. By using [(11)C]PBR28, we&#xD;
      need to exclude PBR28 nonbinders from the data to study changes in PBR. By using a PET ligand&#xD;
      that binds equally to PBR28 binders and nonbinders, we would be able to study all subjects.&#xD;
      We also confirmed that PBR28 nonbinders determined by PET do not show binding in in vitro&#xD;
      binding assays using blood cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We wish to test new ligands currently being developed in our chemistry group by obtaining&#xD;
      blood samples from additional PBR28 nonbinders (= low affinity binders) and by performing in&#xD;
      vitro binding assays. Because our preliminary analysis of whole body imaging has shown that&#xD;
      the differences between PBR28 binders and nonbinders might somewhat vary among organs and the&#xD;
      cause of the nonbinding phenomenon is not fully understood, after identifying PBR28&#xD;
      nonbinders by binding assays, we will perform whole body imaging using [(11)C]PBR28.&#xD;
