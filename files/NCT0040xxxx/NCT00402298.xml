      This is a study of the safety and efficacy of MDMA-assisted therapy in people with war or&#xD;
      terrorism-related posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) occurs after experiencing a traumatic event or events.&#xD;
      PTSD is a public health problem that causes a great deal of suffering. This study will&#xD;
      examine whether two six to eight-hour long sessions of 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine&#xD;
      (MDMA)-assisted therapy scheduled three to five weeks apart are safe, and whether combining a&#xD;
      fully therapeutic dose of MDMA with psychotherapy, compared with a low (&quot;active placebo&quot;)&#xD;
      dose of MDMA, will reduce PTSD symptoms, with symptoms measured four times, twice during the&#xD;
      study, and during two follow-up assessments six and twelve months after the second&#xD;
      experimental session. People who received the active placebo dose of MDMA can then take part&#xD;
      in an &quot;open label&quot; study continuation, with the participant receiving a fully active dose of&#xD;
      MDMA on two more six to eight hour-long psychotherapy sessions. Open-label means that the&#xD;
      participants and the researchers know that the participant will receive the fully active dose&#xD;
      of MDMA. People who receive the full dose of MDMA, and anyone who received low-dose MDMA and&#xD;
      does not undergo the open-label study continuation will have PTSD symptoms measured six and&#xD;
      twelve months after the second fully active or low dose MDMA session. People who take part in&#xD;
      the open label study continuation have their PTSD symptoms checked six and 12 months after&#xD;
      the second open label MDMA-assisted session.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MDMA is a substance that has unique effects that make it well suited to intensive therapy.&#xD;
      MDMA may belong to a new class of drugs, called entactogens, that produce feelings of&#xD;
      closeness to others, empathy, well being, and insightfulness. Currently, MDMA is scheduled in&#xD;
      the US and Israel, and doctors and therapists cannot give it to people outside of research&#xD;
      studies like this one. Anecdotal reports of therapy conducted before MDMA was made illegal&#xD;
      suggest that MDMA-assisted therapy may benefit people with PTSD, and there is an ongoing&#xD;
      placebo-controlled study of MDMA-assisted therapy in people with crime or war-related PTSD&#xD;
      occurring in the US.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will look at MDMA-assisted therapy in 12 individuals aged 18 years or older&#xD;
      diagnosed with PTSD that arose out of war or terrorism-related trauma, with PTSD symptoms not&#xD;
      improving after trying at least one treatment. Eight of 12 participants will be assigned to&#xD;
      receive the full dose of MDMA, and four will be assigned to receive a low or &quot;active placebo&quot;&#xD;
      dose of MDMA during each of two experimental sessions. People will be assigned to full or&#xD;
      low-dose MDMA &quot;by chance,&quot; as by flipping a coin. The fully active dose consists of an&#xD;
      initial dose of 125 mg MDMA and a supplemental dose of 62.5 mg given 2 to 2.5 hours later.&#xD;
      The active placebo dose consists of an initial dose of 25 mg MDMA and a supplemental dose of&#xD;
      12.5 mg.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will last approximately four months, and will include two sixty minute long&#xD;
      introductory therapy sessions, two active placebo or fully active dose MDMA-assisted therapy&#xD;
      sessions, a sixty to ninety minute long therapy session 24 hours after each experimental&#xD;
      session, and one to two hour-long therapy sessions occurring weekly between the first and&#xD;
      second experimental session, and between the second experimental session and the end of the&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PTSD symptoms will be measured at the start of the study and eight weeks (two months) after&#xD;
      the second experimental session. PTSD symptoms are assessed six and twelve months after the&#xD;
      second experimental session in people who do not take part in the open-label study&#xD;
      continuation. People who take part in the open-label study continuation will have their PTSD&#xD;
      symptoms measured six and twelve months after the second MDMA-assisted therapy session.&#xD;

    <description>The Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale for DSM-IV (CAPS-IV) is a clinician administered and scored assessment of PTSD symptoms via structured interview based upon PTSD diagnosis in DSM-IV. It contains symptom subscales, a CAPS-IV total severity score, and a diagnostic score. The total severity score is a sum of symptom frequency and intensity scores for the subscales B (re-experiencing), C (avoidance) and D (hypervigilance) and ranges from 0 to 136, with higher scores indicating greater severity of PTSD symptoms.</description>

        <description>The Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale for DSM-IV (CAPS-IV) is a clinician administered and scored assessment of PTSD symptoms via structured interview based upon PTSD diagnosis in DSM-IV. It contains symptom subscales, a CAPS-IV total severity score, and a diagnostic score. The total severity score is a sum of symptom frequency and intensity scores for the subscales B (re-experiencing), C (avoidance) and D (hypervigilance) and ranges from 0 to 136, with higher scores indicating greater severity of PTSD symptoms.</description>
