  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to develop and validate a questionnaire (non-invasive technique) to&#xD;
      identify patients who are hypervigilant for noxious visceral sensations and who show a lower&#xD;
      threshold to report pain. This questionnaire would be useful in studies investigating the&#xD;
      role of visceral pain hypervigilance and pain sensitivity in the comorbidity of IBS with&#xD;
      other somatic disorders.&#xD;

      Methods: There are two phases to the project: (1) Development of the pool of items&#xD;
      (questions), and (2) validating individual items based on their correlation with an objective&#xD;
      gold standard - the response criterion statistic, B, calculated from a barostat test of pain&#xD;
      sensitivity. We will perform barostat tests of pain thresholds and other measures of pain&#xD;
      sensitivity that are based on sensory decision theory analysis in a relatively large group of&#xD;
      84 IBS patients. Sensory decision theory divides pain perception into two components: a&#xD;
      perceptual sensitivity index (P(A)) and a response criterion (B). The response criterion is&#xD;
      sensitive to cognitive and psychological influences on pain perception. We will use this&#xD;
      index (B) as the gold standard against which to select items for a scale to measure&#xD;
      hypervigilance for visceral pain. The process will involve (a) pooling items from existing&#xD;
      questionnaires that seem related to the concept, (b) obtaining additional questions from&#xD;
      consultants who are experts in visceral perception and psychometric test development, (c)&#xD;
      identifying the items that show the strongest correlations with the response criterion, (d&#xD;
      using principal components analysis to reduce the items to the smallest number of&#xD;
      non-redundant items that predict the response criterion and treating this as a provisional&#xD;
      questionnaire of hypervigilance, and (e calculating psychometric characteristics of this&#xD;
      questionnaire.&#xD;
