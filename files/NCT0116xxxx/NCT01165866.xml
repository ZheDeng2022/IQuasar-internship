      Is intravenous metoclopramid as effective as intravenous ondansetron in the treatment of&#xD;
      persistent vomiting in patients with acute gastroenteritis.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this study, we will compare the efficacy of a single intravenous dose of ondansetron&#xD;
      versus intravenous metoclopramide in the treatment of persistent vomiting in simple&#xD;
      gastroenteritis in a larger RCT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PEC Al Saad is the main Pediatric Emergency Center in the state of Qatar with approximately&#xD;
      200,000 visits annually. It has a capacity of 42 observation beds providing most of the&#xD;
      inpatient facilities except for intensive care monitoring. Patients admitted to the PEC are&#xD;
      managed there for 48 hours or longer if needed, they are then transferred to Hamad General&#xD;
      Hospital for further investigation and completion of their treatment. Hamad General Hospital&#xD;
      is the main tertiary care hospital in Qatar with a capacity of around 100 pediatric beds.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All acute gastroenteritis patient between 1-14 years presenting to PEC Al Saad with diarrhea,&#xD;
      persistent vomiting , fail oral rehydration and admitted to the observation unit for&#xD;
      intravenous hydration will be eligible for the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients were excluded from the study if they had one or more of the following: Previous&#xD;
      abdominal surgery,Suspicion of surgical abdominal,Bile stained vomitus,History of hepatic&#xD;
      illness,Metabolic diseases, including diabetes mellitus and in-born error of&#xD;
      metabolism,Children with shock or impending shock,Sever dehydration,Previous hypersensitivity&#xD;
      or abnormal reaction to metoclopramide or ondansetron,Parenteral antiemetic treatment in the&#xD;
      previous 24hrs or Seizure disorder&#xD;
&#xD;
      One group will receive a single IV dose of Ondansetron after enrollment and the second group&#xD;
      will receive a single IV dose of Metoclopramide On arrival to the PEC, patients with simple&#xD;
      gastroenteritis will be assessed by the pediatric specialist on-call, patients with&#xD;
      persistent vomiting who fail ORS therapy will be admitted for observation and management as&#xD;
      usual. The pediatric specialist in the observation room will take history, perform full&#xD;
      physical examination and evaluate the degree of dehydration . Patients will be assessed for&#xD;
      eligibility to the study based on the aforementioned inclusion criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Guardians of eligible patients will be approached regarding the study, explaining the purpose&#xD;
      and the treatment modalities, patients will be included after obtaining a verbal and written&#xD;
      consent. Complete blood count, serum electrolytes, renal function, HCO3 level will be&#xD;
      requested for all study patients upon recruitment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The observation physician will complete the data collection sheet that will include the&#xD;
      patient's demographics, physical examination, degree of dehydrations , number, amount and&#xD;
      time of every vomiting and diarrhea episode and lab work results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intravenous Ondansetron and intravenous metoclopramide treatment will be prepared by a&#xD;
      pharmacist, who will put each treatment in a sealed coded envelope A and B depending on the&#xD;
      content (Ondansetron or Metoclopramide). The code of intervention package will be deposited&#xD;
      with the pharmacist. The medical team in addition to the patients will be blinded to the&#xD;
      content of the envelopes. There will be no detectable difference in the color or smell of the&#xD;
      different solutions, the amount of medication will be determined by the weight of the patient&#xD;
      (Ondansetron 0.15mg/kg maximum dose 4mg, Metoclopramide 0.3 mg/kg maximum dose 10mg),&#xD;
      medication will be added in the buret and mixed with normal saline to make up 50cc of&#xD;
      medication and normal saline for intravenous administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will receive a single intravenous dose of the study medication after enrollment over&#xD;
      10 minutes and intravenous fluids will be started at the rate required based on the&#xD;
      percentage of dehydration. Patients will be kept NPO for one hour after the completion of the&#xD;
      antiemetic infusion and last episode of vomiting, oral fluids will be started thereafter and&#xD;
      increased gradually until fully tolerated and the patient is ready for discharge. If vomiting&#xD;
      recur NPO period will be extended for another half an hour from the last vomit and oral&#xD;
      fluids will be tried gradually until the patient is fit for discharge. Vomiting and diarrhea&#xD;
      episodes will be recorded by time and amount throughout admission.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Duration of IV fluid therapy needed, observed study medication side effects all will be&#xD;
      recorded until the patient is ready for discharge if extra-pyramidal side effect are seen or&#xD;
      suspected diphen hydramine 1 mg/kg (maximum dose 50mg/dose) will be given over 5 minutes and&#xD;
      the patient will be observed until free of symptoms. Addition interventions such as&#xD;
      antibiotics, antipyretics will be recorded as additional therapies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The treating physician will discharge patients based on clinical grounds such as tolerating&#xD;
      oral fluids, improve hydration status, absent of significant fluid loss through stool and&#xD;
      free of major medication side effects. Patients found to be fit for discharge, will have date&#xD;
      and time of discharge documented. In addition parents will be asked to give a number ,that&#xD;
      represent their perception of their child's nausea symptoms and oral intake improvement on&#xD;
      discharge, 0-100, 0 indicates no improvement and 100 back to base line.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Discharge Patients will be sent home on oral fluid therapy and BRAT diet. All patients will&#xD;
      be followed up for 72 hours post discharge by a phone call daily.&#xD;
