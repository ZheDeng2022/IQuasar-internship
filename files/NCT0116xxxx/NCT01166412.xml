      WHAT IS THE STUDY PRODUCT? The study product is a contraceptive patch, which has the study&#xD;
      drug on the patch. The patch is applied directly to the skin and it contains Levonorgestrel&#xD;
      (LNG) in a time-release form. LNG is a hormone that has been tested and been approved by the&#xD;
      Food &amp; Drug Administration (FDA) in other forms, for example: contraceptive pills,&#xD;
      intrauterine devices (IUDs, which are put in the uterus (womb)) and implants (drug in silicon&#xD;
      tubing placed under the skin). The use of LNG in the form of a contraceptive patch makes this&#xD;
      an experimental drug because the way the drug will be absorbed in the body is a new&#xD;
      technique. This study drug does not contain estrogen and it does not protect against HIV,&#xD;
      AIDS, or any other sexually transmitted diseases (STDs).&#xD;
&#xD;
      LNG is a progestin (a type of drug that is like a hormone. Progestins can cause changes at&#xD;
      the opening of the uterus (womb), such as thickening of the cervical mucus (fluid). This&#xD;
      thickened cervical mucus makes it difficult for the male's sperm to reach and fertilize the&#xD;
      woman's egg. Since LNG is being absorbed through your skin from the patch, it is&#xD;
      experimental, and it is unknown if this study product will really prevent pregnancy like&#xD;
      other progestins.&#xD;
&#xD;
      WHY IS THIS STUDY BEING DONE?&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to find out:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  How well the patch prevents pregnancy&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  How safe the patch is to use every day&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  How much study drug needs to be in the patch to make sure that it prevents pregnancy&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  How the study drug in the patch affects cervical mucus (fluids)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  How the study drug in the patch affects your rate of ovulation (how often you release an&#xD;
           egg)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  How well the patch sticks to your skin, without falling off, for a week at a time&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Whether the patch causes any skin irritation or rash (redness or itchiness)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Whether the study drug in the patch affects your everyday life and if it causes any side&#xD;
           effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      WHAT DOES THE STUDY INVOLVE? We expect that there will be approximately twenty (20) women at&#xD;
      each of the six (6) participating clinics in the study. In total, there will be about 120&#xD;
      women from all over the United States who will be in this study. This study is comparing the&#xD;
      effectiveness of two different doses of the study drug (40ug and 75 ug) in the patches. This&#xD;
      study is an open-label randomized trial, meaning that you and your study doctor will be aware&#xD;
      of the dosage of study drug that you will be given. Randomization means that you will be&#xD;
      selected by chance, like tossing a coin or rolling a dice. You have a 50% chance of being in&#xD;
      the group that receives the 40ug dose patch or the group that receives 75ug dose patch.&#xD;

      This is a Phase I/II, multi-center, open-label, randomized, parallel group, pharmacokinetic,&#xD;
      pharmacodynamic study of the AG1000-6.5 and AG1000-12.5 transdermal contraceptive delivery&#xD;
      systems (TCDS) in healthy women followed as an outpatient for up to three 28-day cycles (12&#xD;
      weeks or approximately 3 months). During this study, subjects will receive active treatment&#xD;
      with the LNG TCDS patches for 11 weeks, followed by one week of post-treatment assessment.&#xD;
      The TCDS is designed for one week of patch wear. This study will be conducted by the National&#xD;
      Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) in its Contraceptive Clinical Trials&#xD;
      Network (CCTN) at 6 sites in the USA and will enroll approximately 120 women.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will enroll approximately 120 subjects, who will be randomized across all sites&#xD;
      into the two treatment groups (~60 subjects at each dose level). The randomization schedule&#xD;
      will be further stratified to ensure enrollment of approximately 50% of subjects with BMI &gt;32&#xD;
      kg/m2 and &lt;40 kg/m2 and approximately 50% of subjects with BMI &lt;32 kg/m2 for each dose level.&#xD;
