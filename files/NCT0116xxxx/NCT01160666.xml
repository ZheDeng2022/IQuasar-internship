  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sjögren's syndrome (SS) is a systemic autoimmune disease characterized by an increase in BAFF&#xD;
      (BLyS) levels and a resulting B cell hyperactivity. B cells are involved in the pathogenesis&#xD;
      of SS in both systemic and glandular features, and B cell downregulation may lead to a&#xD;
      decrease of disease activity. Moreover, pathogenesis of SS is closed to that of Systemic&#xD;
      lupus erythematosus, where Belimumab has been proven to be effective.&#xD;

&#xD;
      This phase II open-label study has 2 mains objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the proof of concept of efficacy of belimumab in subjects with SS&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the safety and tolerability of belimumab in subjects with SS Belimumab will&#xD;
           be administered (10mg/kg on D0 D14 D28 and every 28 days for 24 weeks, with extension to&#xD;
           48 weeks if responders) to all patients&#xD;
