      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Retrospective analyses of long-term BASKET findings identified patients with large&#xD;
      drug-eluting stents (DES) (&gt;2.5mm Stents) as patients at risk for late cardiac death/nonfatal&#xD;
      myocardial infarction. In view of new DES with absorbable polymers and new bare metal stents&#xD;
      BMS) with thin struts and biocompatible polymers, BP-II will be launched to test their&#xD;
      comparative clinical safety up to 12 years if treated with an aspirin/prasugrel combination,&#xD;
      since prasugrel halved stent thrombosis rates compared to clopidogrel in a large ACS trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective is to demonstrate non-inferiority of the Nobori DES stent compared to&#xD;
      the Xience Prime DES stent on safety and e cacy in patients requiring stents &gt;=3.0mm in&#xD;
      diameter on the background of contemporary dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) with prasugrel&#xD;
      and aspirin&#xD;

      Background and Study Design&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is a multicentre, prospective, randomized, open-label trial comparing safety and&#xD;
      efficacy of the Nobori® drug-eluting stent (DES), the Xience Prime® DES, and the ProKinetic®&#xD;
      bare-metal stent (BMS) in patients at low risk of restenosis, i.e. receiving stents &gt;=3.0mm&#xD;
      diameter only, on the background of contemporary antiplatelet therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2289 patients were recruited at 8 centres in 5 countries and randomized 2:1 to DES or BMS,&#xD;
      and 1:1 to either DES subgroup. Randomization was stratified according to centre.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis Datasets&#xD;
&#xD;
      The full analysis set (FAS) will include all randomized patients of whom written informed&#xD;
      consent was obtained. Patients needing an urgent PCI were asked for oral consent prior to the&#xD;
      percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) and for written informed consent afterwards. This&#xD;
      means that some randomized patients gave oral but not written informed consent. Patients who&#xD;
      gave oral informed consent and died before written informed consent could be obtained will be&#xD;
      included in the FAS. All other patients without signed informed consent will be excluded&#xD;
      regardless of oral informed consent. In accordance with the intention-to-treat principle all&#xD;
      patients will be analysed according to the allocated treatment group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The per-protocol set (PPS) will include only those patients from the FAS who did not have one&#xD;
      of the following major protocol violations:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  inclusion criteria not met&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  exclusion criteria met&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  procedures performed that were not approved by Institutional Review Board (IRB)/Ethics&#xD;
           Committee (EC)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  no study stent (Nobori,Xience Prime or ProKinetic) received&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  only stents &lt; 3mm in nominal size, provided that the maximum vessel size measured during&#xD;
           the procedure was &lt;2.75mm&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  undergoing multiple step procedure with a different stent received than randomised for&#xD;
           the second or subsequent step.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion of patients older than 75 years was not approved by the local ethics committee of&#xD;
      the Canton St.Gallen, Switzerland, and consequently, age &gt; 75 years was added to the&#xD;
      exclusion criteria for the center Cantonal Hospital St. Gallen. Patients who did not receive&#xD;
      the randomly allocated stent, but another study stent according to the study protocol, will&#xD;
      be included and analysed according to the stent received (per protocol analysis).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Demographic and Baseline Characteristics&#xD;
&#xD;
      Demographic and baseline data will be presented for each treatment arm using the FAS.&#xD;
      Continuous variables will be presented as mean, standard deviation, median, 1st and 3rd&#xD;
      quartile. Categorical variables will be presented as frequencies and percentages. Comparisons&#xD;
      of continuous data will be done using a non-parametric Kruskal-Wallis rank sum test.&#xD;
      Comparisons of categorical data will be done using a chi-squared test if the expected number&#xD;
      of observations in each cell exceeds 5 - otherwise Fisher's exact test will be applied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objective&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective is to demonstrate non-inferiority of the Nobori DES stent compared to&#xD;
      the Xience Prime DES stent on safety and efficacy in patients requiring stents &gt;=3.0mm in&#xD;
      diameter on the background of contemporary dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) with prasugrel&#xD;
      and aspirin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Endpoint&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary endpoint is the time to the first major adverse cardiac event (MACE) observed&#xD;
      within 24 months. MACE is a composite endpoint including cardiac death, myocardial infarction&#xD;
      (MI) and target-vessel revascularization (TVR).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Hypothesis, Model and Method of Analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Hypothesis&#xD;
&#xD;
      The statistical null-hypothesis is that Nobori DES is inferior to Xience Prime DES regarding&#xD;
      the MACE rate (pi) at 24 months when using a prespecified non-inferiority margin (delta), in&#xD;
      terms of absolute risk difference:&#xD;
&#xD;
      H0 : pi_Nobori - pi_XiencePrime &gt;= delta&#xD;
&#xD;
      The alternate hypothesis is that the e ect of Nobori DES is non-inferior to Xience Prime DES&#xD;
      using the same non-inferiority margin as above.&#xD;
&#xD;
      alternate hypothesis (HA) : pi_Nobori - pi_XiencePrime &lt; delta&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will use a non-inferiority margin of 3.8 % absolute risk difference. The sample size&#xD;
      calculation was based on delta = 3.8 %, assuming a MACE rate in the Xience Prime arm of 7.6&#xD;
      %, as observed in the BASKET-PROVE (BP) trial, for both DES (Kaiser et al., 2010). The stated&#xD;
      non-inferiority margin considers a 50 % relative excess of events or more in the Nobori DES&#xD;
      arm as inferior. This threshold is similar to that of the LEADERS trial (Windecker et al.,&#xD;
      2008).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Model and Method of Analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
      The absolute risk difference of MACE at 24 months between the Nobori DES and the Xience Prime&#xD;
      DES will be compared to the non-inferiority margin, using a two-sided 95 % confidence&#xD;
      interval (CI) applying a continuity-corrected modification of the Wilson's score method&#xD;
      (Newcombe, 1998). Non-inferiority will be declared if the upper limit of the 95 % CI of the&#xD;
      absolute risk difference does not exceed delta. The probability of MACE within 24 months will&#xD;
      be calculated and graphically visualized using the Kaplan-Meier estimator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will estimate the hazard ratio of the Nobori DES versus the Xience Prime DES using Cox&#xD;
      proportional hazards (PH) survival analysis, allowing to test for superiority if&#xD;
      non-inferiority can be established. The model will contain the factor &quot;stent type&quot; (Nobori&#xD;
      DES vs. Xience Prime DES) and be stratified according to the variable &quot;centre&quot;. Hazard ratios&#xD;
      will be presented with the corresponding 95 % CI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proportional hazards assumption will be assessed in two steps: 1) Visually through&#xD;
      log-log curves and 2) Testing Schoenfeld's residuals for time-dependency. In case of&#xD;
      non-proportional hazards a time-independent logistic regression model will be used to analyze&#xD;
      the incidence of the primary endpoint within 24 months as binary variable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An additional landmark analysis will be performed for the time-intervals 0-12 months and&#xD;
      12-24 months. We will t a time-strati ed Cox PH model, including an interaction term between&#xD;
      the factor &quot;stent type&quot; and time-interval (0-12 vs. 12-24 months). The interaction term will&#xD;
      be compared to the null hypothesis of no-interaction using a log-likelihood ratio test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The analyses are performed on the PPS (but see sensitivity analyses). All tests will have a&#xD;
      two-sided significance level, alpha, of 0.05.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Handling of Data and Missing Values&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will be analysed for potential extreme outliers. If present, each outlier will be&#xD;
      investigated. However, outliers will be included in the analysis, except if a clinical cause&#xD;
      can be excluded. There will be no missing values for the primary endpoint since losses to&#xD;
      follow-up can be incorporated in the Cox proportional hazards models by censoring the time&#xD;
      observed at the last follow-up/last contact date (right censoring).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sensitivity Analyses&#xD;
&#xD;
      S1: All analyses will be repeated for the FAS. It is important to note that for&#xD;
      non-inferiority analyses, estimates from intention-to-treat analyses are less conservative,&#xD;
      i.e., more likely to establish non-inferiority than those from per-protocol analyses, since&#xD;
      differences may be blurred by including patients with major protocol violations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      S2: In the Cox PH model described for the primary endpoint, we will test for an interaction&#xD;
      between &quot;stent type&quot; and &quot;centre&quot; using a log-likelihood ratio test. A significant&#xD;
      interaction means differences in treatment-effect across centres. This will determine whether&#xD;
      the treatment-effect was homogeneous, which is important for the interpretation of results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      S3: In case of non-proportional hazards, time-independent analyses using logistic regression&#xD;
      will be performed for the prespecified time-periods 0-12 months and 0-24 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subgroup Analyses&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will investigate the effect of Nobori DES versus Xience Prime DES across the following&#xD;
      prespecified subgroups:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Diabetes (yes vs. no).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Acute coronary syndrome (ACS, ACS vs. stable coronary artery disease).&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Stent length per segment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. At least one stent &lt;3.0mm received (yes vs. no).&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. More than one stented segment (yes vs. no).&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Prior myocardial infarction (yes vs. no).&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Smoking current (yes vs. no).&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. Gender (female vs. male)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interaction terms between the factor &quot;stent type&quot; and each of the above factors will be&#xD;
      included in the Cox regression model, together with the main effects of &quot;stent type&quot; and the&#xD;
      respective factor, and compared to the null hypothesis of no-interaction using a&#xD;
      log-likelihood ratio test. A significant interaction means that the effect of treatment&#xD;
      differs between subgroups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
      A1: To demonstrate superiority of the Nobori DES over the ProKinetic BMS in terms of MACE&#xD;
      within 24 months. This comparison will also act as an internal control for the&#xD;
      non-inferiority analysis (primary objective), with the ProKinetic BMS as a putative placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A2: To compare the Nobori DES to the ProKinetic BMS, and the Nobori DES to the Xience Prime&#xD;
      DES in terms of late harm (cardiac death, MI and stent thrombosis from month 12-24).&#xD;
&#xD;
      B: To compare the Nobori DES to the Xience Prime DES, and the Nobori DES to the ProKinetic&#xD;
      BMS in terms of additional secondary endpoints.&#xD;
&#xD;
      C: To investigate the safety - or possible harm - of DAPT with prasugrel and aspirin in&#xD;
      patients with stable coronary artery disease (CAD) versus acute coronary syndromes (ACS)&#xD;
      regarding bleeding events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      D: To assess the effect of DAPT with aspirin plus prasugrel versus aspirin plus clopidogrel&#xD;
      as used in a historical comparator cohort with BASKET-PROVE (BP).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Endpoints&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Components of the primary endpoint.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Cardiac death&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Myocardial infarction (MI)&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
                  -  Any TVR&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  Non-MI related TVR&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Composite safety endpoint of cardiac death and non-fatal MI.&#xD;

&#xD;
             -  Definite or probable&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Definite, probable or possible&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Major bleeding including fatal bleeding, i.e., BARC &gt;=3.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. All cause death.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Net clinical benefit = Primary endpoint plus major bleeding.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Hypothesis, Model and Method of Analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
      [A1] Nobori DES versus ProKinetic BMS: MACE within 24 months&#xD;
&#xD;
      The statistical null hypothesis is that there is no difference between Nobori DES and&#xD;
      ProKinetic BMS in terms of MACE. The Cox PH model described for the primary end-point which&#xD;
      includes the factor &quot;stent type&quot; now compares Nobori DES to ProKinetic BMS. In case of&#xD;
      non-proportional hazards a logistic regression model will be used to analyze the incidence of&#xD;
      MACE within 24 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      [A2] Nobori DES versus ProKinetic BMS, and Nobori DES versus Xience Prime DES: Late harm&#xD;
&#xD;
      The statistical null hypothesis is that there is no difference between Nobori DES and&#xD;
      Prokinetic BMS, and no difference between Nobori DES versus Xience Prime DES in terms of late&#xD;
      harm. We will use a Cox PH model, landmark analysis and a time-strati ed Cox PH model (for&#xD;
      the time-intervals 0-12 months and 12-24 months), as described in for the primary objective,&#xD;
      for the endpoints cardiac death, non-fatal MI and stent thrombosis. Assessment of the&#xD;
      proportional hazards assumption will be performed in accordance to the method described for&#xD;
      the primary endpoint. In case of non-proportional hazards, logistic regression models will be&#xD;
      used to analyze the incidence of events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      [B] Nobori DES versus ProKinetic BMS, and Nobori DES versus Xience Prime DES: Other secondary&#xD;
      endpoints&#xD;
&#xD;
      The statistical null hypothesis is that there is no difference between Nobori DES and&#xD;
      ProKinetic BMS, and Nobori DES and Xience Prime DES in terms of secondary endpoints. All&#xD;
      secondary endpoints 1-6 will be analysed using Cox PH models including the factor &quot;stent&#xD;
      type&quot; and strati ed according to &quot;centre&quot; for events within 24 months - as specified for the&#xD;
      primary endpoint. Assessment of the proportional hazards assumption will be performed in&#xD;
      accordance to the method described for the primary endpoint. In case of non-proportional&#xD;
      hazards, logistic regression models will be used to analyze the incidence of events. Landmark&#xD;
      analyses at 0-12 and 12-4 months will be performed. Absolute probabilities of the event of&#xD;
      interest will be calculated and graphically visualized using the Kaplan-Meier estimator.&#xD;
      Subgroup analyses as specified for the primary endpoint will be performed for all secondary&#xD;
      endpoints.&#xD;
&#xD;
      [C] Safety of DAPT with prasugrel and aspirin in patients with stable CAD regarding bleeding&#xD;
      events&#xD;
&#xD;
      For this analysis we will generate four subgroups based on stent type (DES vs. BMS) and&#xD;
      indication: 1) DES+Stable CAD, 2) DES+ACS, 3) BMS+Stable CAD, and 4) BMS+ACS. The endpoints&#xD;
      major bleeding (BARC &gt;=3), MACE (including its components), and stent thrombosis (see&#xD;
      definitions in Section 5.1) will be analysed using Kaplan-Meier curves and a Cox PH model&#xD;
      including the above groups as the 4-level factor &quot;indication-by-stent type&quot; and the&#xD;
      stratifying factor &quot;centre&quot;. Thereby, we will make the following comparisons: a) DES-ACS vs.&#xD;
      DES-stable CAD, b) BMS-ACS vs. BMS-stable CAD, and c) DES-stable CAD vs. BMS-stable CAD. In&#xD;
      case of non-proportional hazards, the survival analysis will be complemented by a&#xD;
      time-independent logistic regression analysis on major bleeding events at 24 months as well&#xD;
      as at a cut-o point of 12 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      [D] Comparison between BP II and BP regarding DAPT with prasugrel plus aspirin versus&#xD;
      clopidogrel plus aspirin&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two separate comparisons between trials will be made in terms of major bleeding events (BARC&#xD;
      &gt;=3), MACE (including its components), and stent thrombosis (see definitions in Section 5.1),&#xD;
      using the FAS from both trials (BP: as presented in Kaiser et al. (2010)):&#xD;
&#xD;
      Comparison 1&#xD;
&#xD;
      DAPT (12 months duration) with prasugrel and aspirin in DES patients (BP II) versus DAPT (12&#xD;
      months duration) with clopidogrel and aspirin in DES patients (BP).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The statistical null-hypothesis is that there are no differences in rates of major bleeding&#xD;
      events between DAPT treatment with prasugrel plus aspirin (as in BP II) versus clopidogrel&#xD;
      plus aspirin (as in BP) in patients treated with DES. The endpoint major bleeding (BARC &gt;=3)&#xD;
      will be compared between all DES patients in BP II and all DES patients in&#xD;
&#xD;
      BP using a Cox PH model. Because patient populations come from two different trials rather&#xD;
      than from one single randomised trial, a propensity score weighted analysis will be used to&#xD;
      balance the data for confounding effects. The predictors for the calculation of propensity&#xD;
      scores will include potential confounders, i.e., variables that may affect the treatment&#xD;
      (DAPT as determined by trial) as well as the outcome (occurrence of bleeding events) such as:&#xD;
      age, sex, body weight, renal function, hypertension, diabetes, prior MI, etc. We will use&#xD;
      inverse probability weighting (Hernan &amp; Robins, 2006) to estimate the e ect of &quot;DAPT&quot; on the&#xD;
      hazard of bleeding. The Cox PH model will include &quot;DAPT&quot; (prasugrel vs. clopidogrel) and&#xD;
      &quot;indication&quot; (stable CAD vs. ACS) as predictors. In addition, the model will include the&#xD;
      interaction between &quot;DAPT&quot; and &quot;indication&quot;, to test whether the difference due to type of&#xD;
      DAPT depends on indication. Hazard ratios along with corresponding 95 % CI will be presented.&#xD;
      If the two DES in BP II (Nobori and Xience Prime) should differ with regard to bleeding&#xD;
      events, MACE and stent thrombosis, we will also include &quot;stent type&quot; as predictor (Cypher and&#xD;
      Xience in BP were very similar).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Comparison 2&#xD;
&#xD;
      DAPT with prasugrel and aspirin (1 month duration) (BP II) versus DAPT with clopidogrel and&#xD;
      aspirin (12 months duration) (BP) in stable CAD patients with BMS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The statistical null-hypothesis is that there are no differences in rates of major bleeding&#xD;
      events between DAPT treatment with prasugrel plus aspirin (as in BP II) versus clopidogrel&#xD;
      plus aspirin (as in BP) in stable CAD patients treated with BMS. The endpoint major bleeding&#xD;
      (BARC &gt;=3) will be compared between stable CAD patients with BMS from BP II and stable CAD&#xD;
      patients with BMS from BP using a Cox PH model. As for comparison 1 a propensity score&#xD;
      weighted analysis will be performed, and an inverse probability weighting used to estimate&#xD;
      the effect of &quot;DAPT&quot; on the hazard of bleeding. Hazard ratios along with corresponding 95 %&#xD;
      CI will be presented.&#xD;
&#xD;
      General&#xD;
&#xD;
      In case of non-proportional hazards, the survival analysis will be complemented by a&#xD;
      time-independent logistic regression analysis on bleeding events at 12 and 24 months,&#xD;
      estimating odds ratios instead of hazard ratios.&#xD;
&#xD;
      5.3 Handling of Data and Missing Values&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will be analysed for potential extreme outliers. If present, each outlier will be&#xD;
      investigated. However, outliers will be included in the analysis, except if a clinical cause&#xD;
      can be excluded. In case of missing values for secondary endpoints, all available values will&#xD;
      be used and no imputation of missing values will be performed.&#xD;

      Clinical Relevance:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The results of BPII will provide evidence for the performance of the newest-generation stents&#xD;
      on the market in daily practice and insights about the efficacy and safety of current stent&#xD;
      designs in an all-comer population. Moreover, BPII will assess the performance of DAPT with&#xD;
      aspirin and prasugrel compared with aspirin plus clopidogrel in terms of ischemic and&#xD;
      bleeding endpoints. - Thus, these findings should have major impact on the current use of&#xD;
      coronary stents, medical antiplatelet therapy regimes and our understanding of possible&#xD;
      reasons for late stent thrombosis.&#xD;
