      Diagnosis of oral squamous cell carcinoma is always too late. Due to this delay for&#xD;
      diagnosis, prognosis is very bad. It has been demonstrate that systematic oral examination&#xD;
      decrease mortality in tobacco and alcohol consumers population (Sankaranarayanan and al.&#xD;
      Lancet 2005, 4, 1927-1933 ). An other study has demonstrate that autofluorescence is a useful&#xD;
      technic for detection of dysplasia and squamous cell carcinoma that cannot be seen with&#xD;
      conventional oral examination((Poh CF Wink Cancer Res on 2006 ( 22 ): 6616-22; Poh CF Head&#xD;
      Neck 2007 ( 1 ) 7 71-6).However autofluorescence has never been evaluated has a screening&#xD;
      tool for systematic oral examination and the reproductibility has never been studied.&#xD;

      The study of Sankaranarayanan and al. (Lancet on 2005, 4, 1927-1933) demonstrated the&#xD;
      influence on the decline of mortality of a realized systematic screening, by a simple visual&#xD;
      inspection of the oral cavity in alcohol-smoker patients. The sensibility of the visual&#xD;
      inspection to diagnose the oral cancers is estimated at 85 % and the specificity in 97 %.&#xD;
      However some lésions are not diagnosed with common oral examination(Downer MC Oral Oncol.&#xD;
      2004 ( 3 ) 264-73). The examination in autofluorescence coupled with the visual inspection&#xD;
      could be a solution to improve early diagnosis of potentially malignant disorders . Indeed,&#xD;
      dysplasia and cancerous lesions can be revealing by an autofluorescence examination (Lane PM&#xD;
      J Biomed opt on 2006 ( 2 ): 024006). Other works demonstrated that infra-clinical lesions&#xD;
      could be revealed by the autofluorescence (Poh CF Wink Cancer Res on 2006 ( 22 ): 6616-22;&#xD;
      Poh CF Head Neck 2007 ( 1 ) 7 71-6). On the other hand the sensibility and the specificity of&#xD;
      the autofluorescence in situation of screening were not estimated and studies carried out on&#xD;
      sick subjects tend to overestimate the metrological performances of a technique. Besides the&#xD;
      reliability of the technique (reproducibility) was not studied. For these reasons, it is&#xD;
      recommended to realize in situation of screening in an alcohol-smoker population:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  a study of reliability to estimate the reproducibility inter-observer of the examination&#xD;
           of the oral cavity in tissular autofluorescence and,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  a feasibility study to estimate the potential contribution of the autofluorescence with&#xD;
           regard to a simple visual inspection in the screening of the potential malignant&#xD;
           disorders.&#xD;
