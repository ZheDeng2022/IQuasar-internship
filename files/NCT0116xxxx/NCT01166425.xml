      Study Design This is the second study of a multiphase, multicenter trial that will&#xD;
      comprehensively examine lithium in the treatment of pediatric participants with bipolar I&#xD;
      disorder. In order to examine the treatment of bipolar disorder with lithium, this study will&#xD;
      include four phases of treatment. The first phase, the Efficacy Phase, will include&#xD;
      participants being randomized to either lithium or placebo for 8 weeks to determine the&#xD;
      efficacy of lithium in the treatment of children and adolescents with bipolar I disorder.&#xD;
      Once participants complete the Efficacy Phase, participants may be eligible to continue in&#xD;
      the Long- Term Effectiveness Phase for a maximum of 24 weeks of lithium treatment.&#xD;
      Subsequently, participants meeting response criteria during the Long-Term Effectiveness Phase&#xD;
      will be eligible to continue in the Discontinuation Phase. During the Discontinuation Phase,&#xD;
      participants will be randomized to either placebo or lithium treatment for up to 28 weeks.&#xD;
      Finally, those participants who experience a mood relapse during the Discontinuation Phase&#xD;
      will be enrolled in an Open Label Restabilization Phase and treated with lithium for up to 8&#xD;
      weeks.&#xD;

      The following are the objectives of this study:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To determine if lithium is more efficacious in reducing symptoms of mania than placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To describe the short-term safety of lithium in the pediatric population relative to&#xD;
           placebo treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To examine the effectiveness and efficacy of lithium as a maintenance treatment for&#xD;
           children and adolescents with bipolar I disorder.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To examine the long-term and short-term safety and tolerability of lithium in pediatric&#xD;
           bipolar I disorder.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. To examine the effects of lithium treatment over time on specific aspects of cognitive&#xD;
           functioning that have been reported to be adversely affected by lithium in the adult&#xD;
           population.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. More specifically, to determine the integrity of fine-motor, attention, verbal memory,&#xD;
           and selected executive function domains prior to treatment at baseline, at the end of&#xD;
           week 8/early termination of the Efficacy Phase, and at the end of week 24/early&#xD;
           termination from the Long- Term Effectiveness Phase (after 24/32 weeks of lithium&#xD;
           treatment).&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. To examine the relationship between systemic exposure to lithium and effectiveness and&#xD;
           toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. To examine the long-term safety and tolerability of combination therapy, lithium plus&#xD;
           other psychotropic agents, in pediatric bipolar I disorder.&#xD;
&#xD;
        9. To critically assess the efficacy of lithium for prophylaxis against recurrence of mood&#xD;
           symptoms in children and adolescents.&#xD;
&#xD;
       10. In those participants who discontinue treatment with lithium and experience a mood&#xD;
           relapse, to determine the duration of lithium treatment necessary before&#xD;
           re-stabilization is achieved.&#xD;
&#xD;
       11. To evaluate the influence of intrinsic factors [e.g. age, gender, race, renal function,&#xD;
           height, (measured by stadiometer) and weight] on lithium exposure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Study population for this study: Children and adolescents 7- 17 years of age who meet&#xD;
      DSM-IV diagnostic criteria for Bipolar I (mania, mixed mania) without psychotic symptoms as&#xD;
      determined by a child and adolescent psychiatrist will be eligible for this study.&#xD;

One mid-week dose increase will be scheduled in addition to the weekly increases at the scheduled in-clinic visits. On day 3 (+/- 2 days), a dose increase of 300 mg may occur based on the results of a telephone call placed by the study investigator to the participant's parent/guardian. During the telephone call, the prescribing clinician will assess medication adherence, adverse events, and overall improvement since baseline.</description>
