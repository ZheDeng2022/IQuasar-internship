  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      NRI research focuses on nursing interventions that are patient-centered, culturally&#xD;
      congruent, cost-effective and outcome-driven. High priority populations of interest are&#xD;
      veterans with Spinal Cord Injuries (SCI). The development of innovative tele home techniques&#xD;
      for preventing pressure ulcers in veterans with SCI is of high importance in the VA. Our&#xD;
      findings may provide clinicians with improved methods for skin and wound assessment and more&#xD;
      effective and efficient PUP strategies for Hispanic and non Hispanic veterans. The new model&#xD;
      for primary care, the patient-centered Medical Home provides an exciting change in the VA&#xD;
      that can benefit from the proposed project.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>

      The goal of the proposed project is to evaluate outcomes of a telehealth nursing intervention&#xD;
      based on a social cognitive behavioral model to promote self management in pressure ulcer&#xD;
      prevention, reduce costs and identify barriers and facilitators of using telehealth&#xD;
      technology in the home environment. The telehealth intervention links to the Medical Home&#xD;
      Model in the areas of providing self-management, patient education and family involvement in&#xD;
      the veterans' care at home. NRI research focuses on nursing interventions that are&#xD;
      patient-centered, culturally congruent, cost-effective and outcome-driven. Improving SCI care&#xD;
      and the quality of life in veterans is a critical component of the VA mission. Veterans with&#xD;
      SCI face many secondary complications including pressure ulcers (PU). Although PUs in SCI has&#xD;
      been conceptualized as a mechanical alteration in skin integrity, there is ample evidence&#xD;
      that supports the presence of a behavioral component to PU development. Based on promising&#xD;
      results from our feasibility and validation pilot study, we propose &quot;TELEPUPPS&quot; (TELE&#xD;
      pressure ulcer prevention problem solving), a program that innovatively combines two unique&#xD;
      and complementary telehealth technologies--wireless tele-technology with camcorders and an&#xD;
      in-home messaging device for veterans and their informal caregivers to prevent PUs. The&#xD;
      proposed project is a randomized, controlled multi-site trial. The study will be conducted at&#xD;
      the NF/SG VHS in Gainesville and Lake City, Florida and the VA Caribbean Healthcare System&#xD;
      (VACHS) in San Juan, Puerto Rico. Two hundred and thirty-two Hispanic and non Hispanic white&#xD;
      veterans with SCI, caregivers and the absence of a PU for at least six months will be&#xD;
      randomly assigned to one of two study arms: (1) TELEPUPPS; or (2) telephone attention control&#xD;
      (TAC). Both groups will receive the usual medical care provided by the VA. The TELEPUPPS&#xD;
      participants will learn self care management of PUP through a program based on a social&#xD;
      cognitive behavioral model to reinforce problem solving and self-efficacy in preventing&#xD;
      pressure ulcers. The program has been translated and validated for Puerto Rican veterans&#xD;
      using focus groups. The TELEPUPPS participants will receive six TELEPUPPS sessions and the&#xD;
      TAC participants will have six phone contacts every other week for three months. All&#xD;
      participants will be assessed at baseline (T1), three months (T2), and nine months (T3).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessments will focus on 1) the study outcomes: PU prevention (Number of PUs and stage of&#xD;
      PU), QOL, depression, adherence to self-management strategies for PUP, veteran and caregiver&#xD;
      satisfaction, costs, and barriers and facilitators; (2) potential mediating variables:&#xD;
      problem solving and self-efficacy; and (3) covariates including demographics and socio&#xD;
      economics: age, ethnicity, education, marital status, rural vs. urban, caregiver, income,&#xD;
      employment/retired status and health status variables. VA Project&#xD;
