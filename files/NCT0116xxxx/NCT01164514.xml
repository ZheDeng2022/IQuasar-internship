  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test the safety of an experimental vaccine against sepsis&#xD;
      (infection of the blood) alone and with an experimental adjuvant (a substance that may&#xD;
      improve vaccine effectiveness). This study will also find out how well antibodies are made&#xD;
      after receiving vaccine alone or vaccine combined with adjuvant. Participants will include up&#xD;
      to 34 healthy volunteers between the ages 18-50 years. Participants will be randomly assigned&#xD;
      to 1 of 4 groups to receive vaccine alone, vaccine with adjuvant (2 different dosages) or&#xD;
      placebo (inactive substance). Participants will receive 3 vaccinations at different times&#xD;
      during the study (Day 0, Day 29 and Day 59). Study procedures will include blood samples,&#xD;
      urine samples, electrocardiogram (measures heart activity) and a completion of a memory aid&#xD;
      to document side effects. Participation will involve 16 clinic visits and 3 follow-up&#xD;
      telephone calls over 12 months.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Invasive Gram negative bacterial infection resulting in sepsis continues to command&#xD;
      substantial morbidity and mortality despite effective antibiotics and modern intensive care.&#xD;
      It has been estimated that there are 300,000 cases per year in the United States. The&#xD;
      emergence of multiple antibiotic resistant strains of bacteria adds to the urgency of finding&#xD;
      novel therapies for the treatment of gram negative sepsis. Sepsis is a systemic inflammatory&#xD;
      condition characterized by fever, hypotension, tachypnea, and tachycardia which can lead to&#xD;
      multiple organ/system failure and ultimately death. This study is a randomized, partial&#xD;
      blinded, placebo-controlled phase I safety and immunogenicity study in healthy subjects of&#xD;
      detoxified J5 core glycolipid/ group B meningococcal outer membrane protein vaccine for&#xD;
      gram-negative bacterial sepsis administered with and without synthetic unmethylated&#xD;
      cytosine-guanosine motif (CPG) oligodeoxynucleotide 7909 adjuvant. The primary objective of&#xD;
      this study is to establish the safety and tolerability of the combination of vaccine and CPG&#xD;
      7909. The secondary objective of this study is to determine if the combination of vaccine&#xD;
      with the CPG 7909 is more immunogenic than vaccine alone. One dosage level of vaccine based&#xD;
      on lipopolysaccharide (LPS) content will be studied in a three-dose regimen administered&#xD;
      intramuscularly (IM). Since prior experience indicates no significant differences in&#xD;
      immunogenicity response between the 10 and 25 microgram (mcg) doses of vaccine, researchers&#xD;
      will test the 10 mcg dose. Researchers will also use 2 different doses of the CPG 7909&#xD;
      adjuvant (500 mcg and 250 mcg). There will be a control group that receives normal saline&#xD;
      (NS) alone (placebo). The purpose of this study is to assess whether or not this vaccine is&#xD;
      safe and well tolerated when given with an adjuvant, CPG 7909. The other goal of this study&#xD;
      is to ascertain whether or not the combination of vaccine and adjuvant induces a more robust&#xD;
      antibody response to the vaccine than is observed with the vaccine alone. The study&#xD;
      population will include approximately 28-34 healthy subjects ages 18-50 years, inclusive,&#xD;
      recruited from existing pool of Center for Vaccine Development (CVD) subjects. Subjects will&#xD;
      be randomized to one of four study groups: (Group 1) 10 mcg vaccine alone; (Group 2) 10 mcg&#xD;
      vaccine plus 500 mcg CPG 7909; (Group 3) 10 mcg vaccine plus 250 mcg CPG 7909; and (Group 4)&#xD;
      placebo (normal saline). After blood is obtained for pre-vaccination antibody levels,&#xD;
      subjects will receive 3 vaccinations at Day 0, 29 and 59. Subjects will be followed for&#xD;
      safety (both clinical signs and symptoms and laboratory tests) and antibody response&#xD;
      (anti-core glycolipid antibody by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay [ELISA], and&#xD;
      opsonophagocytic response). Assessments for reactogenicity will be done for 60 minutes post&#xD;
      vaccination and on the first and second days after each vaccination at the CVD and via 8 day&#xD;
      memory aid, to be completed by the subject, after each vaccination. An electrocardiogram&#xD;
      (EKG) will be performed after each vaccination. Blood sampling will be performed on Days 0,&#xD;
      14, 36, 66, 120, 180, and 365 to measure the immunogenicity of the vaccine with and without&#xD;
      adjuvant and for antibody screening. A safety evaluation will be done by telephone on Day 90,&#xD;
      Day 150 and Day 239, and a final safety antibody and immunogenicity evaluation will be done&#xD;
      during the clinic visit at Day 365.&#xD;
