      Delirium is an acute confusional state characterized by fluctuating mental status,&#xD;
      inattention, and either disorganized thinking or an altered level of consciousness. This form&#xD;
      of organ dysfunction occurs in up to 50% of hospitalized patients and is associated with&#xD;
      worsening mortality, prolonged hospital length of stay, higher health care costs, and&#xD;
      accelerated functional and cognitive decline. Despite the negative consequences of delirium,&#xD;
      the majority of cases are unrecognized by hospital physicians because it is not routinely&#xD;
      screened for. In an effort to facilitate delirium screening, we sought to validate two brief&#xD;
      delirium assessments (&lt;2 minutes) in the hospital setting.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Delirium is often missed because physicians do not routinely screen for this diagnosis. Most&#xD;
      delirium assessments can take up to 10 minutes to perform making them less likely to be&#xD;
      incorporated into the routine physician assessment. Using brief (&lt;2 minutes) and easy to use&#xD;
      delirium assessments may ameliorate this quality of care issue. The Confusion Assessment&#xD;
      Method for the Intensive Care Unit (CAM-ICU) possesses these characteristics, but has only&#xD;
      been validated in mechanically and non-mechanically ventilated intensive care unit patients.&#xD;
      As a result, it still requires validation in the non-ICU hospitalized patients. Recently, we&#xD;
      also developed the Brief Confusion Assessment Method (B-CAM) which is a modification of the&#xD;
      CAM-ICU. The benefit is that it takes even less time than the CAM-ICU. However, it also&#xD;
      requires validation in hospitalized patients. As result, we propose the following and the&#xD;
      following specific aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim #1: To validate the B-CAM in non-ICU hospitalized patients. The B-CAM will be performed&#xD;
      by a clinical trials associate (CTA) and principal investigator in 150 non-ICU hospitalized&#xD;
      patients that are &gt; 65 years old. This instrument will be validated against a psychiatrist's&#xD;
      Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th. Edition Text Revision assessment&#xD;
      as the reference standard.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim #2: To validate the CAM-ICU in non-ICU hospitalized patients. The CAM-ICU will be&#xD;
      performed by a clinical trials associate (CTA) and principal investigator in approximately&#xD;
      150 non-ICU hospitalized patients that are &gt; 65 years old. This instrument will be validated&#xD;
      against a psychiatrist's Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th. Edition&#xD;
      Text Revision assessment as the reference standard.&#xD;
