  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to develop an exploratory design for future Proof-of-Concept&#xD;
      trials which reliably and accurately measure the central nervous system (CNS) effects of&#xD;
      potentially new drugs that oppose the effects of ketamine at a subanesthetic dose level given&#xD;
      to healthy volunteers. A functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and&#xD;
      electroencephalogram (EEG) performed simultaneously during a ketamine challenge will register&#xD;
      the effects triggered by Ketamine.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This will be a double-blind (neither physician nor patient knows the name of the assigned&#xD;
      drug), placebo-controlled, randomized (study drug assigned by chance), 2 way crossover&#xD;
      ketamine challenge study (participants may receive different interventions sequentially&#xD;
      during the trial) in 24 healthy male volunteers. For all participants, this study will&#xD;
      consist of an eligibility screening examination, two 2-day treatment periods, separated by at&#xD;
      least 1 week, and a follow-up examination about 7 days after last dose administration. The&#xD;
      maximal study participation for each volunteer will be around 6 weeks. Apart from observing&#xD;
      possible neural and vascular ketamine effects, the cerebral ketamine effects will be&#xD;
      investigated by simultaneously performing fMRI/EEG during ketamine administration. These&#xD;
      investigations will be done while volunteers rest as well as during cognitive testing (visual&#xD;
      oddball task). Safety evaluations include continuous monitoring of vital signs and oxygen&#xD;
      saturation. Due to the pharmacokinetic properties of ketamine the assessments will start&#xD;
      after an intravenous ketamine bolus (drug given directly into the vein over a short period of&#xD;
      time) followed by a 1 minute break. During the assessments there is a continuous intravenous&#xD;
      (minimal) drug administration. Before the assessments start there will be an intravenous&#xD;
      bolus of 0.1 mg/kg ketamine in 5 minutes time followed by a 1 minute break after which a&#xD;
      continuous infusion will start of 0.015625 mg/kg/min ketamine. Since the plasma level&#xD;
      elevates during the infusion the administered dose will be lowered by 10% every 10 minutes.&#xD;
