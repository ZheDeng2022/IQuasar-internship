  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This trial examined the impact of acute and chronic almond ingestion on indicators of glucose&#xD;
      control (postprandial glycemia and hemoglobin A1c). Hypotheses:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Almonds will stimulate the secretion of GLP-1 in healthy adults and in adults with T2D&#xD;
           The investigators were not able to demonstrate a relationship between GLP-1 secretion&#xD;
           and almond consumption. Individuals with T2D were characterized with significantly&#xD;
           greater GLP-1 secretion than the non-diabetic control subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Acute ingestion of almonds will decrease the postprandial glycemia and insulinemic&#xD;
           responses in healthy controls and in individuals with T2D The investigators data support&#xD;
           the hypothesis: almond consumption by individuals with T2D did attenuate postprandial&#xD;
           glycemia; however, almond consumption did not alter glycemia in non-diabetic control&#xD;
           subjects&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Chronic almond ingestion for 12 weeks will reduce fasting glucose (FG) and A1c&#xD;
           concentrations in individuals with T2D The investigators data demonstrated modest&#xD;
           beneficial effect of almond consumption on A1c in individuals with T2D. Almond&#xD;
           consumption was also associated with modest weight loss as compared to the control&#xD;
           treatment (low fat cheese sticks).&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  12 subjects with diagnosed T2D for at least 1 year and 12 healthy individuals without&#xD;
             T2D will be recruited for the acute almond trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  24 subjects with diagnosed T2D for at least 1 year will be recruited for the chronic&#xD;
             almond trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects from the campus population and nearby communities will be recruited to&#xD;
             participate in these trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Men and women must be willing to comply with the experimental protocol including the&#xD;
             restriction of nut consumption:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  subjects recruited for the acute almond study must agree not to consume any nuts&#xD;
                  or nut butters for 1-week prior to and during the 2-week trial&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  participants in the chronic almond study must agree not to consume nuts or nut&#xD;
                  butters more than 2 times per week during the 12 week trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants must have a body mass index (BMI) from 20 to 35 kg/m2 and are aged 30 to&#xD;
             70 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects with T2D may take oral hyperglycemic agents.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  History of a peanut allergy&#xD;
