  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Critically ill patients are consistently underfed. Feeding protocols are standardized system&#xD;
      tools used to guide nutrition practices, but to date have failed to improve delivery of&#xD;
      nutrition. The PEP uP Protocol is a new enhanced feeding protocol. Twenty North American&#xD;
      Intensive Care Units (ICUs) will assess baseline nutrition practices. Ten ICUs will be&#xD;
      randomized to implement the PEP uP Protocol and educational intervention, and ten will be&#xD;
      randomized to continue usual care. Nutrition practices will be reevaluated 6 months after&#xD;
      baseline. The investigators hypothesize that the PEP uP Protocol will increase delivery of&#xD;
      nutrition, and may ultimately lead to improved survival of critical illness.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There is a well known and well described relationship between malnutrition, immune&#xD;
      dysfunction, and infection. Critically ill patients are often hypermetabolic and can rapidly&#xD;
      become nutritionally compromised. Repeated efforts over the past few years have not&#xD;
      significantly improved the amount of calories delivered via the enteral route. Historically,&#xD;
      feeding protocols have been used to guide the delivery of enteral nutrition (EN) but they&#xD;
      frequently utilize conservative, reactionary approaches to optimizing nutrition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We propose a new, innovative approach that protocolizes an aggressive set of strategies to&#xD;
      providing EN and shifts the paradigm from reactionary to proactive followed by de-escalation&#xD;
      if nutrition therapy is not needed. The key components of this new protocol are the&#xD;
      following: 1) Starting feeds at the target rate based on increasing evidence that some&#xD;
      patients tolerate starting nutrition at a higher rate of delivery and that slow start ups are&#xD;
      not necessary. For patients who are hemodynamically stable, we propose to shift from an&#xD;
      hourly rate target goal to a 24 hour volume goal and give nurses guidance on how to make up&#xD;
      this volume if there was an interruption for non-gastrointestinal reasons. This&#xD;
      'volume-based' goal represents a significant shift in practice from traditional fixed hourly&#xD;
      rate goals to a new protocol in which nurses can increase the hourly rate depending on how&#xD;
      many hours they have left in the day to ensure that the patient receives the 24 hour volume&#xD;
      within the day. 2) For patients who are deemed unsuitable for high volume intragastric feeds,&#xD;
      we provide an option to initiate 'trophic feeds.' Trophic feeds represent an idea to provide&#xD;
      a low volume of a concentrated feeding solution for 24 hours or longer, designed to maintain&#xD;
      gastrointestinal structure and function rather than meet their protein and caloric goals.&#xD;
      This option should reduce the numbers of patients ordered to be kept nil per os (NPO). Thus,&#xD;
      PEP uP patients may gain some of the benefit of early EN. 3) To optimize tolerance in the&#xD;
      early phase of critical illness, we propose to use a semi elemental feeding solution instead&#xD;
      of a standard polymeric solution. There is some evidence that these semi elemental solutions&#xD;
      are better assimilated than polymeric solutions in the critical care setting. These solutions&#xD;
      can be changed to a more traditional polymeric solution once the patient is tolerating&#xD;
      adequate amounts of nutrition. 4) Rather than wait for a protein debt to accumulate because&#xD;
      of inadequate delivery of EN, protein supplements are prescribed at initiation of EN and can&#xD;
      be discontinued if EN is well tolerated and they are receiving all their protein requirements&#xD;
      through their standard EN. This strategy guarantees that the patient will most likely receive&#xD;
      all their protein requirements in the early phase of their critical illness. 5) Rather than&#xD;
      wait for a problem with gastrointestinal tolerance to develop, we propose to start motility&#xD;
      agents at the same time EN is started with a re-evaluation in the days following to see if it&#xD;
      is necessary. By preventing delayed gastric emptying, which frequently occurs in this patient&#xD;
      population, we can improve nutritional adequacy. 6) Based on emerging evidence that a higher&#xD;
      gastric residual volume (the volume of feeds remaining in the stomach when the bedside nurse&#xD;
      aspirates the feeding tube) is safe and perhaps results in greater nutritional adequacy, we&#xD;
      will include a higher gastric residual volume of 300ml in our protocol. It has been shown in&#xD;
      one randomized trial that a feeding protocol that starts a motility agent empirically at the&#xD;
      time of initiation of feeds and uses a higher threshold for a critical gastric residual&#xD;
      volume (250 ml) improves nutritional adequacy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since the bedside nurses initiate and utilize feeding protocols to achieve target goals, we&#xD;
      will couple this newer generational feeding protocol with a comprehensive nurse-directed&#xD;
      nutritional educational intervention that will focus on its safe and effective&#xD;
      implementation. This focus on nursing nutrition education represents a major shift away from&#xD;
      traditional education which has focused on dietitians and physicians.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our hypothesis is that this aggressive feeding protocol combined with a nurse-directed&#xD;
      nutrition educational intervention will be safe, acceptable, and effectively increase protein&#xD;
      and energy delivery to critically ill patients. We postulate that this increased provision of&#xD;
      calories and protein may translate into improved clinical outcomes, particularly for the&#xD;
      patients at the extremes of weight, but the current study is not powered to demonstrate such&#xD;
      a difference.&#xD;
