  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Malaria caused by Plasmodium falciparum continues to be a global problem with devastating&#xD;
      consequences. A greater understanding of the immunologic and parasitologic factors associated&#xD;
      with infection and disease is badly needed, and will accelerate the development of highly&#xD;
      protective vaccines for both mothers and children. Pregnancy malaria is associated with low&#xD;
      birth weight, maternal anemia, and gestational hypertension, and both inflammation and the&#xD;
      fetal response to infection may contribute to these poor outcomes. Childhood malaria is a&#xD;
      major cause of mortality, and we have found that risk of childhood malaria is related to in&#xD;
      utero exposure to pregnancy malaria, as well as other host factors like iron status and&#xD;
      constitutive cytokine levels. Pregnancy malaria is caused by a distinct parasite binding&#xD;
      phenotype, and as our primary hypothesis in this study we speculate that severe childhood&#xD;
      malaria parasites may also have distinct features. A longitudinal cohort study will be&#xD;
      conducted in Ouelessebougou, Mali an area of intense seasonal transmission. Up to 2000&#xD;
      pregnant women and their infants and 2000 children ages 0 - 3 will be enrolled and followed&#xD;
      to age 5 years, with clinical evaluation and periodic venous and peripheral blood samples&#xD;
      obtained. In addition, 2000 febrile children up to age 10 years will be enrolled at the&#xD;
      Ouelessebougou district health centers or the Gabriel Tour(SqrRoot)(Copyright) Pediatric&#xD;
      Hospital in Bamako, Mali, with acute and convalescent samples being obtained and 500 pregnant&#xD;
      women enrolled at the health centers and hospital in Ouelessebougou district or the Gabriel&#xD;
      Tour(SqrRoot)(Copyright) Hospital in Bamako for a case-control study on pregnancy malaria and&#xD;
      preeclampsia. Clinical, parasitologic and host response (including immunologic) endpoints&#xD;
      will be analyzed using appropriate statistical methods, including possible confounders, to&#xD;
      determine factors associated with infection and disease in pregnant woman and young children.&#xD;

&#xD;
        A study participant must satisfy the following criteria to be enrolled in this study:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Pregnant women aged 15-45 years and their newborn infants who are residents of the&#xD;
             district of Ouelessebougou for at least one year at the time of enrollment; OR&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Children aged 3 years or less, who are residents of the district of Ouelessebougou for&#xD;

             Gabriel Toure Hospital in Bamako.&#xD;
&#xD;
             Febrile non-hospitalized children (aged 0-10 years) with non-severe malaria will be&#xD;

             of Gabriel Toure Hospital in Bamako and for a case-control study of pregnancy malaria&#xD;
             and preeclampsia. Cases include women with signs/symptoms of preeclampsia. Control&#xD;
             pregnant women without signs/symptoms of preeclampsia will be recruited sequentially&#xD;
             after identification of individual cases, matched for parity, age (+/-2 years) and&#xD;
             pregnancy trimester.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. The study participant or parent/guardian understands the study and gives informed&#xD;

        A participant will be excluded from the study if any one or more of the following criteria&#xD;
        are met:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Chronic, debilitating illness, other than malaria, determined by history and physical&#xD;
             examination fo mother or study participant.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Conditions that in the judgment of the investigator could increase the risk to the&#xD;
