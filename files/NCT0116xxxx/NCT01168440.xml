      VHL patients may benefit from sunitinib. This study will investigate the following objectives&#xD;
      :&#xD;
&#xD;
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the objective response rate according to RECIST criteria, in VHL patients&#xD;
           with advanced tumors or tumors untreatable by other means, and treated with sunitinib.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the safety and tolerability of sunitinib in VHL patients according to the&#xD;
           NCI-CTC criteria Version 3.0.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the following time-to-event endpoints: overall survival, time to disease&#xD;
           progression, progression free survival, time to response and duration of response.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate quality of life in VHL patients receiving sunitinib.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Treatment with sunitinib, 50 mg PO daily, 6 weeks courses with schedule 4/2 (4 weeks of&#xD;
      treatment followed by 2 weeks of rest).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dose reduction depending on type and severity of toxicity. At the end of treatment period&#xD;
      (after 8 courses), responding and well tolerating patients will be allowed to receive&#xD;
      sunitinib upon investigator's opinion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up for up to 24 months from inclusion.&#xD;

             medications. Otherwise, patient is not eligible. Anticoagulants drugs (among which&#xD;
             coumadin/warfarin) may be, either switched to low-molecular-weight heparin, or be&#xD;
             subject to individual dose adaptation in order to maintain INR in the target range&#xD;
             with regard to patient's history, all along his participation in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Signed and dated informed consent document stating that the patient, or legally&#xD;
             representative, has been informed of all the aspects of the trial prior to enrollment&#xD;
