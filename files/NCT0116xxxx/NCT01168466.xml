      This study measures whether the symptoms of frontotemporal dementia (FTD) can be successfully&#xD;
      treated by (a) biofeedback training to increase brain blood flow, (b) biofeedback to increase&#xD;
      the frequency of the brain's dominant brainwave rhythm, and (c) rhythmic stimulation to&#xD;
      increase the brain's dominant brainwave frequency.&#xD;

      Objectives and Significance&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. What is (are) the primary goal(s) of the study The purpose of this study is to evaluate&#xD;
           the efficacy of biofeedback training to increase regional cerebral blood flow (CBF) and&#xD;
           peak alpha frequency (PAF) on the cognitive and behavioral symptoms of frontotemporal&#xD;
           dementia (FTD). We will also measure the effects of EEG driven photostimulation during&#xD;
           PAF neurofeedback on learning of higher PAF states and related clinical outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. What is (are) the secondary goal(s) of the study A diversity of clinical,&#xD;
           neuropsychological, and physiological variables will be collected in this study. For&#xD;
           instance, a full 19-channel quantitative EEG (QEEG) assessment will be performed at&#xD;
           intake. The relationship between EEG power and coherence and the symptoms of this&#xD;
           disorder could potentially provide an important contribution to the literature on the&#xD;
           usefulness of QEEG for differential diagnosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An additional goal of the study is to contribute to the understanding of how neurofeedback&#xD;
      works. For instance, we will take measurements to determine if learning to control the PAF&#xD;
      involves awareness of some internal subjective state related to the PAF. Also, the effect of&#xD;
      the reward signal on a brainwave called the P300 may show the importance of having the reward&#xD;
      tone sounding the majority of the time during neurofeedback sessions. Finally, we will&#xD;
      measure whether blood flow changes during EEG biofeedback and whether the EEG is affected by&#xD;
      blood flow biofeedback.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We propose several measurements that will contribute to an understanding of the mechanism of&#xD;
      action of neurofeedback.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Frontotemporal Dementia and Cerebral Hyperperfusion Single photon emission computed&#xD;
      tomography (SPECT) studies have shown cerebral blood flow to be significantly reduced in the&#xD;
      frontal and temporal regions in FTD patients (Miller et al., 1997; Read et al., 1995). The&#xD;
      anatomical distribution of reduced CBF corresponds to the pattern of neuropsychological&#xD;
      deficits (McMurtray et al., 2006).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Not surprisingly, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computed tomography (CT) in FTD&#xD;
      patients shows atrophy in the frontal and temporal regions (Mendez et al., 1996; Neary and&#xD;
      Snowden, 1996). However, Spilt et al. (2005) hypothesized that neurodegeneration and dementia&#xD;
      are largely secondary to pathologies of cerebral blood flow. When compared to elderly&#xD;
      controls with optimal cognitive function, patients with DSM-IV dementia did not differ&#xD;
      significantly from elderly controls with respect to the number of cerebral infarctions.&#xD;
      Demented patients showed significantly more white matter lesions (p=.028) and cerebrospinal&#xD;
      fluid (CSF; p=.016), but a reduction in cerebral blood flow had the largest effect size&#xD;
      (p&lt;.001). An attempt to build a logistic regression model showed that no significant residual&#xD;
      variance could be explained after cerebral blood flow was included in the model.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Another argument for the central role of blood flow in dementia is that Alzheimer's patients&#xD;
      with brain damage (regions of MRI signal hyperintensity) have increased oxygen extraction per&#xD;
      mL/min. That is, blood supply rather than demand seems to be the problem. Oxygen extraction&#xD;
      would be expected to be unaltered if reduced blood flow were secondary to tissue damage&#xD;
      (Spilt et al., 2005; Yamaji et al, 1997).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Positron emission tomography (PET) imaging in FTD patients reveals reduced glucose metabolism&#xD;
      in the frontal and anterior temporal lobes, but also in the cingulate gyrus, insula, uncus,&#xD;
      and subcortical structures (Jeong et al., 2005; Garraux et al., 1999; Ishi et al., 1998).&#xD;
      Grimmer et al. (2003) performed a longitudinal study on ten patients diagnosed with FTD. At&#xD;
      the initial assessment, FTD patients had reduced metabolic activity compared to controls in&#xD;
      frontal cortical areas, the caudate nuclei, and the thalami. On a 1-2 year follow-up,&#xD;
      significant progression of the original deficits was observed in the orbitofrontal cortex and&#xD;
      the subcortical structures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Given the substantial evidence linking dementia and FTD in particular to reduced cerebral&#xD;
      blood flow, we hypothesize that training FTD patients to increase cerebral blood flow will&#xD;
      alleviate FTD symptoms and slow the progress of the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recent studies have suggested that individuals can learn to increase CBF through biofeedback.&#xD;
      Yoo et al. (2006) showed that participants given feedback of fMRI activity of the auditory&#xD;
      cortex while listening to music were able to significantly increase the mean blood&#xD;
      oxygenation as well as the number of significant voxels. Another study (deCharms et al.,&#xD;
      2005) trained participants to change fMRI activity in the rostral anterior cingulate gyrus&#xD;
      (RACG), a region implicated in pain perception. Control conditions included sham feedback or&#xD;
      feedback from a different brain region. When a noxious thermal stimulus was applied,&#xD;
      participants had decreased pain sensation when trained to decrease RACG activity and&#xD;
      increased pain sensation when trained to increase RACG activity. In another phase of the&#xD;
      study, eight chronic pain patients reported decreased pain after down-training fMRI in the&#xD;
      same region.&#xD;
&#xD;
      fMRI costs more than $1000 per session, which places this form of therapy beyond the reach of&#xD;
      most patients. However, it is possible to provide CBF neurofeedback for the outermost 1.5 cm&#xD;
      of cerebral cortex with a relatively inexpensive device that uses the refractive properties&#xD;
      of oxygenated hemogoblin to red and infrared light (Toomim et al., 2004). A light source is&#xD;
      attached to the scalp (typically on the forehead) with a headband, 3 cm away from an infrared&#xD;
      sensor, which detects the relative absorption by oxygenated blood. This procedure is known as&#xD;
      hemoencephalography or HEG. Toomim et al. (2004) showed that ten sessions improved&#xD;
      impulsivity scores on the Test Of Variables of Attention (TOVA) in 28 patients of diverse&#xD;
      psychopathology. Carmen (2004) provided frontal HEG to 100 migraine patients, and found that&#xD;
      90% of those who completed at least six sessions reported significant improvement in migraine&#xD;
      symptoms. In a single case study, Mize (2004) reported that a child with ADHD showed&#xD;
      significant improvement on the IVA, which improvement persisting into the 18-month follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Frontotemporal Dementia and Peak Alpha Frequency&#xD;
&#xD;
      The PAF in health adults has an average of 10-11 Hz. Higher PAF is associated with higher&#xD;
      memory performance (Klimesch, 1997), reading ability (Suldo, 2000), vocabulary, and response&#xD;
      control (Angelakis et al., 2004a). After a series of cognitive tasks, PAF was reduced in&#xD;
      traumatic brain injury patients compared to normal controls, but only weakly or&#xD;
      nonsignificantly reduced compared to controls during the task or the baseline conditions.&#xD;
      Thus, Angelakis et al. (2004b) argued that PAF is both a trait and a state marker of&#xD;
      cognitive preparedness. Passant et al (2005), Chan et al. (2004) and Yenner et al. (1996) all&#xD;
      observed a reduction in PAF in FTD patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We hypothesize that EEG biofeedback rewarding higher PAF will result in an improvement in&#xD;
      symptoms in FTD patients. In EEG biofeedback or neurofeedback, an individual's real-time EEG&#xD;
      is presented continuously as a visual or auditory signal, and desired variations are&#xD;
      rewarded. A recent double-blind controlled study (Angelakis et al., 2007) showed that&#xD;
      neurofeedback rewarding increased PAF improved cognitive processing speed and executive&#xD;
      function in normal elderly adults.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The efficacy of neurofeedback as a therapy has been demonstrated for attention deficit&#xD;
      hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), epilepsy, anxiety, and addictive disorders. Other disorders&#xD;
      such as schizophrenia, depression, learning disabilities (LD), and traumatic brain injury are&#xD;
      under investigation as candidates for neurofeedback therapy (Monastra, 2003).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Frontotemporal Dementia and EEG-Driven AVS&#xD;
&#xD;
      Like EEG neurofeedback, EEG-dependent auditory and visual stimulation (AVS), has showed&#xD;
      promise for improving cognitive function by modifying the PAF. A substantial body of research&#xD;
      has demonstrated that rhythmic AVS can induce EEG rhythms corresponding to the frequency of&#xD;
      stimulation (Frederick et al., 2004). Russell (1997) reported on a study in which the&#xD;
      continuously varying PAF of LD and ADHD children was used as a signal to produce AVS&#xD;
      alternately at 5% above and 5% below the PAF for 30 second intervals, for 20 minute sessions.&#xD;
      While the theoretical aim of this study was to improve the flexibility of the PAF (not to&#xD;
      change the mean frequency), it showed that treating the PAF can effectively treat cognitive&#xD;
      dysfunction. These children showed significant gains in cognitive and behavioral measures&#xD;
      that persisted to the 16-month follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We hypothesize concurrent EEG-Driven photostimulation during PAF enhancement neurofeedback&#xD;
      (where rewards are presented as auditory tones, with eyes closed) will increase the rate of&#xD;
      learning of PAF enhancement, and have increased therapeutic efficacy compared to PAF&#xD;
      neurofeedback alone. In addition to helping induce higher PAF, rhythmic photostimulation has&#xD;
      the benefit of increasing CBF by inducing repetitive waves of activation throughout the&#xD;
      brain. It may therefore also enhance the effects of the HEG training described above in part&#xD;
      I.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Understanding the mechanism of action of neurofeedback could potentially lead to more refined&#xD;
      methods of treatment with improved efficacy. We propose three measurements that would&#xD;
      contribute to an improved understanding of how neurofeedback works.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. A common practice in EEG neurofeedback is for the reward signal to be adjusted so that&#xD;
           the client spends the majority of the time with the reward tone on. This is believed to&#xD;
           improve motivation and compliance, but there might be another reason. When the reward&#xD;
           tone goes off, it amounts to a rare event requiring a behavioral change. This situation&#xD;
           is similar to the design of many studies which have shown that the absence of an&#xD;
           expected stimulus evokes a positive deflection in the EEG called the P300 wave. The P300&#xD;
           has been associated with the orientation reflex, and with a phase-resetting of the&#xD;
           background EEG rhythms. If a greater P300 during reward tone offset is observed than&#xD;
           during reward tone onset, this would suggest that the brain responds to the loss of&#xD;
           reward with an electrical signal that disrupts and resets ongoing EEG activity. This&#xD;
           would provide independent physiological support to the conventional clinical wisdom of&#xD;
           providing frequent rewards.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Some theorists argue that the efficacy of neurofeedback depends on the normalization of&#xD;
           the abnormal physiology (e.g., PAF or CBF) correlating with the disorder (Duff, 2004).&#xD;
           Others (Othmer, Othmer and Kaiser, 1999) argue that the efficacy of neurofeedback&#xD;
           results from the brain's adaptive responses to the altered brain states induced by&#xD;
           training. This model is similar to that explaining the efficacy of antidepressant drugs,&#xD;
           and could explain the importance of multiple sessions over weeks and months of training.&#xD;
           Thus, we will measure whether changes in clinical and neuropsychological test variables&#xD;
           relate with the changes of PAF and CBF (average and variance per session). The&#xD;
           relationships (or lack thereof) between physiological and psychological variables from&#xD;
           this study will contribute to the field's understanding of how neurofeedback works.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. A criticism raised against HEG training in favor of EEG biofeedback is that blood flow&#xD;
           changes are typically secondary to metabolic demands created by neuronal activity. Thus,&#xD;
           it is unclear whether HEG feedback is training a nonspecific EEG activation or if some&#xD;
           other mechanism is involved. We propose to measure the EEG adjacent to the HEG training&#xD;
           site to determine if HEG changes are correlated with EEG activation (enhanced 14-21 Hz&#xD;
           and reduced 4-7 Hz amplitude, or increased PAF). It is of similar interest to see if the&#xD;
           HEG blood flow intensity measure increases during PAF training.&#xD;
