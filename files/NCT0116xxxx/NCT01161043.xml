      The purpose of this study is to assess performance of a new subcutaneous glucose sensor over&#xD;
      a seven day sensor life when used with currently marketed Medtronic Diabetes devices. In&#xD;
      addition performance of the new sensor will be calculated for use of the new sensor with&#xD;
      proposed new devices using new calibration algorithms.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The first generation Medtronic MiniMed Subcutaneous Glucose Sensor (Sof-Sensor) was&#xD;
      originally approved by the FDA for commercialization as part of the Continuous Glucose&#xD;
      Monitoring System (CGMS) on June 15, 1999 (PMA 980022). The Sensor is composed of a&#xD;
      microelectrode with a thin coating of glucose oxidase beneath several layers of biocompatible&#xD;
      membrane. This same sensor was used as part of subsequent continuous glucose monitoring (CGM)&#xD;
      systems, such as the Guardian REAL-Time and Paradigm REAL-Time sensor augmented insulin pump.&#xD;
      The current configuration of sensor has undergone in vitro and in vivo testing. A new&#xD;
      second-generation glucose sensor (herein referred to as the Comfort Sensor) has been&#xD;
      developed. The first-generation glucose sensor was approved with reported sensor accuracy&#xD;
      (MAD) of 18%; it was labeled for maximum use duration of 72 hours, using only the abdomen as&#xD;
      an insertion site. The new sensor is shorter and has a smaller diameter, with a smaller gauge&#xD;
      introducer needle. The new sensor inserter is designed to be used with the new sensor. The&#xD;
      objectives of this study are to 1) Assess performance of the Comfort Sensor when used over a&#xD;
      period of seven days with currently available devices, and 2) Assess performance of the&#xD;
      Comfort Sensor when used over a period of seven days using new calibration algorithms&#xD;
      (post-processed with algorithm for future devices). Accuracy data will be calculated based on&#xD;
      comparing calibrated glucose sensor values to glucose meter values during in-home testing.&#xD;
      The devices that will be used for gathering sensor data during this study will be: 1) the&#xD;
      Comfort Sensor, 2) the MiniLink (Transmitter), and 3) the Guardian REAL-Time Display Device.&#xD;

    <description>The primary accuracy parameter (primary effectiveness endpoint) was the comparative readings of paired sensor and SMBG glucose readings, measured on days 1 through 6. Accuracy is defined as within 20% agreement between SMBG and paired sensor (within 20 mg/dL if SMBG â‰¤ 80 mg/dL). Accuracy ranges from 0 - 100, with higher number suggests better accuracy.</description>
