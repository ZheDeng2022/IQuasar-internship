  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to assess whether a combination of chemotherapy,&#xD;
      Trastuzumab and RAD001 will result in no evidence of microscopic disease at the time of&#xD;
      surgery in 50% of enrolled patients.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This is an open-label Phase 2 neoadjuvant study for patients with histologically confirmed,&#xD;
      HER-2 positive operable breast cancer. All patients will receive 18 weeks of neoadjuvant&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The trial has an initial 2 week &quot;biomarker lead in&quot; phase. During this two week phase&#xD;
      patients will either receive Trastuzumab alone or Trastuzumab + Everolimus. This two week&#xD;
      lead in phase will be randomized open label. The rest of the 16 weeks of the neoadjuvant&#xD;
      trial treatment is non randomized open label.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the first two weeks of neoadjuvant treatment the eligible subjects will be randomly&#xD;
      assigned to either receive or not receive Everolimus. This assignment will be accomplished by&#xD;
      a previously prepared schedule (maintained by the investigational pharmacy), such that&#xD;
      investigators are unaware of assignment until after the subject has been enrolled on the&#xD;
      study and received assignment of Everolimus or not.&#xD;
