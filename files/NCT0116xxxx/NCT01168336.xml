  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study aims to evaluate the safety and pharmacokinetics of extended release and standard&#xD;
      formulations of betahistine when administered as monotherapy and as compared to their safety&#xD;
      and pharmacokinetics when co-administered with olanzapine and to determine potential dose&#xD;
      limiting toxicities and/or drug-drug interactions affecting the pharmacokinetics or safety of&#xD;
      either medication, with particular emphasis on somnolence and weight gain secondary to&#xD;
      olanzapine treatment&#xD;
