  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      For patients with leukemia who have not responded to or have progressed after an initial&#xD;
      response to standard therapy, therapeutic options are limited. Although responses to standard&#xD;
      regimens do occur, durable remissions are achieved infrequently and current regimens are not&#xD;
      curative in the majority of patients. Identification of active agents in patients with&#xD;
      relapsed Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) ultimately affords the potential for use upfront as a&#xD;
      component of induction regimens that may translate to improved outcome. Therefore,&#xD;
      development of new agents is of critical importance. This study will look at a new,&#xD;
      investigational agent, ON 01910.Na, to determine if it has the potential to help Patients&#xD;
      with AML and Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia (ALL) and transformed Myeloproliferative Neoplasms.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single center, open-label, phase 1/2 study in which 2 to 34 patients with&#xD;
      refractory acute myeloid or lymphocytic leukemia or transformed myeloproliferative neoplasms&#xD;
      (MPNs)who meet all other inclusion/exclusion criteria will be administered a daily dose of&#xD;
      2400 mg ON 01910.Na dose as a intravenous continuous infusion (IVCI) over 24 hours for 72 to&#xD;
      120 consecutive hours every 2 weeks for the first 4 weeks then will receive oral rigosertib&#xD;
      at a 560 mg twice-daily dose as capsules taken continuously.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the phase 1 component of the trial, a standard dose escalation scheme will be followed&#xD;
      with the enrolment of at least three patients treated with a daily dose of 2400 mg ON&#xD;
      01910.Na IVCI over 24 hours for 72 hours. The dose escalation scheme will follow a&#xD;
      traditional dose escalation rule, also known as the &quot;3+3&quot; rule:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If none of the initial three patients treated in the 72-hour cohort experience dose-limiting&#xD;
      toxicity (DLT), during the first two 2-week cycles, then a new cohort of three patients will&#xD;
      be treated at the same 2400 mg/24h daily dose but for an increased 120 hours duration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DLT is defined as an adverse event possibly related to ON 01910.Na that is:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Grade ≥ 3 non-hematological toxicity other than nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, fever,&#xD;
           esophagitis/dysphagia&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Grade ≥ 3 nausea and vomiting uncontrolled by antiemetics; grade ≥ 3 diarrhea&#xD;
           uncontrolled by antidiarrheal agents; grade ≥ 3 drug-induced fever uncontrolled by&#xD;
           antipyretics; grade ≥3 metabolic abnormalities that are not controlled by optimal&#xD;
           supportive care measures&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Grade ≥ 3 stomatitis and/or esophagitis/dysphagia lasting &gt; 3 days&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Marrow cellularity &lt;5% on day 42 or later (6 weeks) from start of therapy without&#xD;
           evidence of leukemia&#xD;
&#xD;
      If one of the three patients in the 72-hour cohort experiences a DLT during the first two&#xD;
      cycles, then three additional patients will be treated for the same 72 hours duration.&#xD;
      Escalation to the 120-hour cohort will proceed only if no more than one of the six patients&#xD;
      treated in the 72-hour cohort experiences a DLT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If two or more patients in the 72-hour cohort experience DLT during the first two cycles,&#xD;
      then the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) will have been exceeded, no further dosing extension&#xD;
      will occur, and a full safety review will determine if further enrollment of patients will&#xD;
      proceed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If none of the initial three patients in the 120-hour cohort experiences DLT during the first&#xD;
      two cycles, this regimen will be confirmed as the Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) and no further&#xD;
      dose escalation will occur.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If one of the three patients in the 120-hour cohort experiences DLT during the first two&#xD;
      cycles, then three additional patients will be treated for the same duration. If no more than&#xD;
      one patient experiences a DLT, the 120-hour regimen will be confirmed as the Maximum&#xD;
      Tolerated Dose (MTD) and no further dose escalation will occur.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If two or more patients in the 120 hours cohort experience DLT during the first two cycles,&#xD;
      then the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) will be determined to be 2400 mg/24h administered for&#xD;
      72 hours every other week.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once the phase 1 portion of the study is completed, accrual to the phase 2 portion will&#xD;
      begin. Patients treated at the MTD during the phase 1 portion will be included in the phase 2&#xD;
      component and will be evaluated for response and secondary end points.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The total study duration is 30 weeks, which includes a 2-week screening phase, a 24-week&#xD;
      dosing phase (4-week rigosertib CIV administration, followed by 20 weeks of oral rigosertib&#xD;
      administration), and a 4-week follow-up phase that begins after the last dose of rigosertib.&#xD;
      Beginning at week 5, patients will be assessed for response every time a complete blood count&#xD;
      (CBC) is performed and followed up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who achieve by week 24 a response or stabilization of their disease are eligible to&#xD;
      receive an additional 24 weeks of rigosertib at the same dose and will be followed up.&#xD;

                  thrombocythemia (ET), polycythemia vera (PV)) with at least 10% blasts in bone&#xD;
                  marrow and chronic myeloid leukemia in a blast phase refractory or relapsing&#xD;
                  after standard therapy&#xD;

             prior chemotherapy to at least grade 1. In the presence of rapidly proliferating&#xD;
             disease, patients can be included after a washout period of 7 days. Hydroxyurea can be&#xD;
             administered as clinically indicated, and no washout is required.&#xD;
