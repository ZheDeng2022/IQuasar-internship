      The purpose of this study is to determine whether dietary quercetin supplementation effects&#xD;
      thermotolerance and heat acclimation in human subjects exposed to exercise/heat stress.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim I. To determine if quercetin in combination with repeated bouts of thermally&#xD;
      stressful exercise will impact intestinal barrier function. The investigators will examine&#xD;
      urinary lactulose excretion, plasma endotoxin,plasma quercetin, inflammatory cytokines (TNF-a&#xD;
      &amp; Il-6), anti-inflammatory cytokines (Il-10), and HSP70 and HSF-1 content of peripheral blood&#xD;
      mononuclear cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim II. To determine whether quercetin's suppresses the ability of human subjects to&#xD;
      acclimate to exercise/heat stress. The investigators will examine body temperatures, heart&#xD;
      rates, physiological strain, sweat and plasma volume responses to standardized heat tolerance&#xD;
      tests.&#xD;

      Overall Protocol:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will involve a repeated-measures design (2 conditions) in which subjects will&#xD;
      perform exercise in the heat. Each condition will begin with an Intestinal Permeability&#xD;
      Measurement (IP1), where subjects will be admitted to the General Clinical Research Center&#xD;
      (GCRC), drinking a test solution and collecting their urine for 8 hours to measure intestinal&#xD;
      integrity prior to heat stress. This will be followed by a Heat Tolerance Trial (HT1: 50min&#xD;
      exercise at 50% VO2max in environmental chamber controlled at 56oC, 20%RF), used as a&#xD;
      baseline measurement of subject's capacity to work in the heat. Following HT1 each subject&#xD;
      will perform 7 Days of Heat Acclimation (HA)exercise (controlled hyperthermia design, each&#xD;
      subject will elevate core temperature &gt;39oC in 50min during 50 minutes of exercise in&#xD;
      environmental chamber controlled at 56oC, 20%RF; rest 10 min in environmental chamber; then&#xD;
      perform another 50min of exercise at this elevated core temperature). On days 1 and 7 of HA&#xD;
      subjects will follow exercise by performing additional Intestinal Permeability Measurements,&#xD;
      providing pre (IP2) and post acclimation (IP3) measurements of intestinal permeability. Day 6&#xD;
      of HA will provide a posttest measurement of subjects' capacity to work in the heat, and will&#xD;
      be synonymous with Heat Tolerance Trial 2 (HT2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will take quercetin during the seven days of HA in one condition, and placebo in the&#xD;
      other. At least 1 month must elapse before a subject will be allowed to repeat the opposite&#xD;
      condition. The order will be balanced (half will take quercetin first, the other half&#xD;
      placebo). This will be a double blinded study. Neither the investigators nor the subjects&#xD;
      will know whether a HA involves quercetin or placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Due to the possibility of outside factors causing variations in intestinal permeability over&#xD;
      the course of the study, IP1 will always be used as a baseline condition, with IP2 and IP3&#xD;
      being scored relative (as percent change) to the first. Subjects will never be supplemented&#xD;
      in IP1, as this might affect basal measurements of permeability. However, because quercetin&#xD;
      supplementation may only exert a transient effect on intestinal permeability, subjects will&#xD;
      always be supplemented (with either placebo or quercetin, according to condition) in IP2 and&#xD;
      IP3.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In all conditions, subjects will be required to follow guidelines on diet and exercise. They&#xD;
      will be instructed to avoid caffeine, alcohol, and to stay well hydrated. They will be&#xD;
      instructed to avoid exercise that is not directly outlined by the experiment (see attached).&#xD;
      Their meals will be provided by the GCRC to ensure adequate nutrition and to avoid high&#xD;
      dietary levels of quercetin. We are currently working with BioNutrition on this menu. To&#xD;
      ensure compliance with this diet, subjects will fill out a food diary.&#xD;
