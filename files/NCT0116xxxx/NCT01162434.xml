  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Treatment resistant depression (TRD) is a major health concern, with 10% of patients with&#xD;
      major depressive disorder not responding to conventional treatments. The investigators&#xD;
      propose to compare the MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) brain scans of patients with TRD,&#xD;
      which were collected during surgical planning for deep brain stimulation, with age, sex,&#xD;
      handedness and education-matched healthy volunteer controls, to investigate anatomical&#xD;
      differences, specifically the volume of certain brain structures.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All the patients treated at Frenchay Hospital, UK, with deep brain stimulation (DBS) for&#xD;
      treatment resistant depression (TRD) will be given a Patient Information Sheet, and asked if&#xD;
      they would like to participate in this research related to their condition. If they indicate&#xD;
      they would like to participate, patients will be asked to sign a separate informed consent&#xD;
      form (ICF) to give permission for their previously collected MRI scan to be used for this new&#xD;
      research purpose. Information on handedness of the patients has not been previously&#xD;
      collected, so patients will be given a short questionnaire to determine their handedness. The&#xD;
      patients will not be required to perform any further tasks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For each patient that agrees to participate in the study, two healthy matched control&#xD;
      participants will be recruited. Participants will be recruited from an existing volunteer&#xD;
      database and by local advertisements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Respondents interested in participating will be given a letter of invite and a participant&#xD;
      information sheet. They will be asked several basic questions including contact details,&#xD;
      health status, age, sex, handedness, highest qualification achieved, and scanning&#xD;
      requirements in order to assess their basic suitability for the study. If suitable,&#xD;
      participants will be invited to attend a screening visit. Here, the informed consent form&#xD;
      will be signed, then their medical history will be taken, and they will be given a MINI&#xD;
      neuropsychiatric evaluation to assess their physical and mental status. Females who have the&#xD;
      possibility of being pregnant will be asked to provide a urine sample to check they are not&#xD;
      pregnant, and will be required to use adequate contraception until after their scan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If suitable, participants will complete two computerised tests of mood. Then they will have a&#xD;
      scan date booked at Frenchay hospital. At the scanning visit, participants will be assessed&#xD;
      for any changes in health since their screening visit, and then will complete an MRI scan.&#xD;
      The same scanner with the same sequences will be used for the healthy controls that were used&#xD;
      for the patients. Two sequences will be collected: a coronal T1 FFE (fast field echo) volume&#xD;
      acquisition and an axial high resolution T2 limited volume acquisition where 16 slices are&#xD;
      collected with 8 above the ACPC (anterior commissure posterior commissure) plane and 8 below.&#xD;
      These sequences match the sequences that our DBS patients have had and will allow both&#xD;
      automated anatomical quantitative analysis (using Statistical Parametric Mapping version 5&#xD;
      (SPM5)) and quantitative description of other MRI signals such as white matter bright spots.&#xD;
      Participants will receive no payment, but can have a printout of their scan if they wish.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The scans will then be analysed and compared to the patient scans.&#xD;
