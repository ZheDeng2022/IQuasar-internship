      Japanese encephalitis (JE) is one of important zoonotic infectious diseases in Taiwan. JE&#xD;
      caused by Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) which transmitted by Culex tritaeniorhynchus and&#xD;
      used swine as amplifying host. Infections leading to overt encephalitis are estimated to be 1&#xD;
      in 1000 cases. Among JE confirmed cases, approximately 25 percent of cases die and 50 percent&#xD;
      of the survivals develop permanent neurologic and/or psychiatric sequelae. JEV circulated in&#xD;
      Taiwan are belonged to genotype III and the vaccine strain selected from same genotype.&#xD;
      Genotype I JEV was first detected in northern Taiwan in 2008 by CDC, and the same genotype&#xD;
      JEV were detected in mosquito collected in central Taiwan by our group. In order to study the&#xD;
      genotypic shift of JEV in Taiwan areas, and the effects of the replacement of genotype on&#xD;
      vaccine, we will conduct the JEV seroepidemiology in Hualien county which was the highest&#xD;
      incidence of JEV in Taiwan. The aims of this study were: (1) study the circulating of&#xD;
      genotype I JEV in Hualien county; (2) determine the virulence of genotype I JEV in human; (3)&#xD;
      differential diagnosis of JEV genotype I or III infection among confirmed cases; (4) measure&#xD;
      the cross neutralizing activity, after immunized with genotype III JEV vaccine, against&#xD;
      genotype I JEV; (5) determine the age-specific seroprevalence of JEV antibody; (6) estimate&#xD;
      the annual risk of infection for JEV.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      According to CDC Taiwan epidemiology data, Hualien county had 6 confirmed JEV infection&#xD;
      patients in 2009 witch was the highest county in Taiwan. Since mass vaccination was arranged&#xD;
      since 45 years ago in Taiwan, most of the JEV infection was happened on the elderly, possible&#xD;
      due to aging and immune compromised. However, from Mennonite Christian Hospital and CDC&#xD;
      records, most of the confirmed JEV patients in Hualien county were aboriginal people. The&#xD;
      youngest patient in 2009 is around 30-year-old who lived in the mountain side aboriginal&#xD;
      village. Whether aboriginal people are at more risk for JEV infection or Genotype I JEV was&#xD;
      appeared in Hualien with more virulent, resistent to vaccine protection is unknown.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to understand the risk of JEV infection and environmental (mosquito, swine)&#xD;
      surveillance, we had arranged a small cohort study in 2 villages. The 2 villages are located&#xD;
      at middle Hualien with direct distance around 20 KM between each other. Both villages had&#xD;
      several pig farms and mosquito numbers in summer were very high. Both villages had document&#xD;
      JEV infection resident in past 2 years. The first village was near the river ready to&#xD;
      entrance the sea (wetlands) and many migrate birds appeared in the summer every year. The&#xD;
      residence were mostly Han people. The seconds village was located very closed to the central&#xD;
      mountain Taiwan and the residence were almost aboriginal people.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this year 2010, we plan to do the following research:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Collect mosquito in 2 villages since May.2010 with RT-PCT method to identify the JEV&#xD;
           genotype&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Collect sera from swine in 2 villages to identify the JEV genotype&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Collect sera from 312 residency in 2 villages at May and Sep 2010 to detect sub-clinical&#xD;
           infection rate. ( estimated sub-clinical infection rate = 2.5%)&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Identify the JEV from new diagnosed patient in 2010.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since virus was hardly detected by RT-PCR or virus isolation from JEV infected patient, the&#xD;
      virus identified from mosquito or swine in the nearby may show indirect evidence of the JEV&#xD;
      genotype.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After comparing the 2 sera from the same person during the summer in these 2 villages, we can&#xD;
      identify:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The subclinical infection rate of the JEV (genotype I or III, depends on JEV isolated&#xD;
           from mosquito)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Whether aboriginal people near the central mountains are at more risk then people near&#xD;
           the wetlands.&#xD;

        Volunteers were recruited from 2 villages in Hualien county Taiwan. There were at least one&#xD;
        patient who had confirmed diagnosis of Japanese virus encephalitis in past 2 years. Many&#xD;
        pig farms were located in these 2 villages also. The volunteers are either living or&#xD;
        working in the villages during 2010 summer. We had blood test for IgM, IgG for Japanese&#xD;
        virus encephalitis before and after the summer season to identify possible subclinical&#xD;
        infection. At the same time, mosquito were analyzed by RT-PCR periodically to identify&#xD;
        possible virus in the community.&#xD;
