  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Malaria, a disease responsible for over one million deaths per year, is caused by a germ&#xD;
      spread by mosquito bites. The purpose of this study is to evaluate a vaccine designed for the&#xD;
      prevention of malaria caused by the parasite, Plasmodium falciparum, and to evaluate the&#xD;
      device used to give the vaccine. This study will provide information on how safe, effective,&#xD;
      and tolerable the vaccine is in healthy adults. The participants will be assigned, by chance,&#xD;
      to receive 3 doses/shots of the vaccine or a placebo (substance that contains no medication)&#xD;
      by injection in the upper arm. Study participants will include 39 healthy adults aged 18-40&#xD;
      years who have not been exposed to malaria and who will enroll at the Emory Vaccine and&#xD;
      Treatment Evaluation Unit in Atlanta, Georgia. Study procedures include physical exams and&#xD;
      several blood samples. Participants will be involved in the study for approximately seven and&#xD;
      one half months.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Malaria is a mosquito-borne disease caused by protozoan parasites of the genus Plasmodium&#xD;
      (P.). It is estimated that there are 350-500 million clinical cases of malaria per year,&#xD;
      accounting for over one million deaths. The majority of deaths occur among children under&#xD;
      five years of age in Africa, especially in those areas with poor access to healthcare&#xD;
      services. Severe disease occurs most frequently with P. falciparum, at least partially due to&#xD;
      its ability to infect a higher percentage of erythrocytes and to adhere to capillary walls.&#xD;
      Development of a safe and effective vaccine targeting P. falciparum is a major public health&#xD;
      goal. To be truly effective in the general population, a vaccine should induce responses&#xD;
      targeting &quot;immunologically&quot; conserved regions. Epitope-based vaccines represent a very&#xD;
      logical approach to this problem because they can be designed to focus immune responses only&#xD;
      on conserved epitopes. The proposed clinical trial will be the first to evaluate a novel&#xD;
      deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA)-based, polyepitope vaccine against P. falciparum malaria. The&#xD;
      study will be conducted as a phase I, randomized, prospective, controlled, single-center,&#xD;
      dose-escalating trial. This study is designed to provide information regarding the safety and&#xD;
      tolerability of the EP (Electroporation) 1300 vaccine that will allow further development of&#xD;
      the vaccine in future studies. Immunogenicity will be assessed in a preliminary fashion as a&#xD;
      secondary endpoint. The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the safety,&#xD;
      reactogenicity and tolerability of the EP1300 (DNA) vaccine administered via electroporation&#xD;
      in healthy adult volunteers. The secondary objectives are to obtain preliminary&#xD;
      immunogenicity data for the EP1300 polyepitope DNA vaccine as assessed by interferon-gamma&#xD;
      enzyme-linked immunospot assay and to assess the tolerability of the administration procedure&#xD;
      in healthy volunteers. Thirty-nine healthy adults aged 18 through 40 who have no previous&#xD;
      history of malaria exposure or infection, no history of travel to malaria-endemic areas, and&#xD;
      who have not received vaccines for malaria infection will be enrolled in this study. Subjects&#xD;
      will be randomized to receive 3 doses of either the DNA vaccine or normal saline placebo at&#xD;
      day 0, 28, and 56. DNA doses will be administered in dose-escalating fashion from 0.25 mg to&#xD;
      4 mg. Dose escalation will proceed following a review of all safety data up to and including&#xD;
      the 2-week safety data time point following the second immunization in the prior dosage&#xD;
      group; review includes participation by Division of Microbiology and Infectious Diseases and&#xD;
      the Safety Monitoring Committee.&#xD;
