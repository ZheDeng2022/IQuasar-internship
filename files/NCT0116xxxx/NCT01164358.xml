  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a prospective, open, not randomized, unilateral multicenter eye study&#xD;
      consisting of two study arms to observe the long term satisfaction of patients after an&#xD;
      INTRACOR treatment. The satisfaction is determined with the help of the patient perception&#xD;
      and the subjective / objective diagnostic data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis of the study is that patients after an INTRACOR treatment are satisfied in the&#xD;
      long term.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is divided into two study arms. The first study arm includes patients of the&#xD;
      preceding study &quot;Intrastromal Correction of Ametropia by Femtosecond Laser (study ISCAF),&#xD;
      study arm 1, Presbyopia sub-group: treatment pattern 5-Rings&quot; and the second study arm&#xD;
      includes patients of the previous &quot;Intrastromal Presbyopia Correction by Means of Femtosecond&#xD;
      Laser (study # 0905)&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis of the study is that patients after a INTRACOR treatment are satisfied in the&#xD;
      long term.&#xD;
&#xD;
      By detailed patient information and a clarification conversation it is guaranteed that every&#xD;
      interested and agreeing patient fulfils the inclusion criteria of this study. The&#xD;
      quantitative measuring values of the patient perception are assessed by a questionnaire. For&#xD;
      measuring the subjective / objective diagnostic data only certificated diagnostic devices are&#xD;
      used. No invasive intervention in the eye will be made to change the visual acuity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Within the scope of the study between 98 and 135 patients should be examined. 49 to 63&#xD;
      patient are intended for the first study arm and 49 to 72 for the second study arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The follow-up examinations are carried out at 12 months and/or 24 months as well as for 36&#xD;
      months after the INTRACOR treatment. The study end points are determined for all follow-up&#xD;
      examinations. The aim criteria should be reached for the final examination, which is after 36&#xD;
      months, at the latest.&#xD;

    <description>Satisfaction is assesed by three questions:&#xD;
Do you fell comfortable with the treatment result? Would you do the traetment again? Would you recommend the treatment to a relativ or a friend?&#xD;
If two out of these three questions are answered with &quot;yes&quot; then it can be assumed that the patient is satisfied.</description>
