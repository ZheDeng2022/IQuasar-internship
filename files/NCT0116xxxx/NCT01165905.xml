  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Treatment of cancer is often more effective when two or more drugs are used together. For&#xD;
      example, when gemcitabine, an approved drug, and ON 01910.Na, a new investigational&#xD;
      anti-cancer drug, are used together to treat cancer cells in laboratory animals, there is&#xD;
      more inhibition of the growth of the cancer cells compared to either drug used by itself.&#xD;
      These results offer promise that gemcitabine and ON 01910.Na could be used to treat cancer in&#xD;
      patients. However, before studies that seek to find out if gemcitabine and ON 01910.Na is an&#xD;
      effective combination in patients can be done, doctors must first know what is largest, safe&#xD;
      dose of ON 01910.Na that can be used in combination with gemcitabine and what is the best&#xD;
      regimen to use. This study is designed to answer that question.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The order of infusion will be gemcitabine first, immediately followed by ON 01910.Na (with&#xD;
      the only exception being the first infusion for those patients undergoing PK sampling; where&#xD;
      the ON 01910.Na infusion will be given first on this occasion). The dose of gemcitabine will&#xD;
      be fixed at 1000 mg/m2 i.v. as a 30 minutes infusion on days 1, 8, and 15 every 28 days. As&#xD;
      of Amendment 2, the starting dose of ON 01910.Na is 250 mg/m2 as a 24 hour intravenous (i.v.)&#xD;
      infusion on days 1, 8 and 15 of a 28-day course. The dose of ON 01910.Na will be escalated in&#xD;
      increments in successive cohorts (dose level (DL) 1 = 250 mg/m2, DL 2 = 650 mg/m2, DL 3 =&#xD;
      1050 mg/m2, DL 4= 1350 mg/m2) of new patients. A course is defined as 4 weeks in length.&#xD;
      Toxicity will be graded according to the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology&#xD;
      Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE v3.0). A minimum of three new patients will be treated&#xD;
      at each dose level with a minimum of a 1 week stagger between the dosing of the first and&#xD;
      remaining patients in each new dose cohort. In exceptional circumstances (e.g. where there is&#xD;
      one slot available in a cohort and two eligible patients have been screened), the Sponsor may&#xD;
      allow four patients to enter a cohort (or seven patients to enter an expanded cohort). A DL&#xD;
      -1A (ON 01910.Na = 125 mg/m2) is set in case dose de-escalation is required with the starting&#xD;
      dose due to ON 01910.Na-related toxicity. A DL -1A gemcitabine = 750 mg/m2 and DL - 1B at 500&#xD;
      mg/m2 are set in case dose de-escalation is required with the starting and subsequent doses&#xD;
      due to gemcitabine-related toxicity. If DLT is not observed in the first three patients, then&#xD;
      the dose of ON 01910.Na will be increased to the next level. If DLT occurs in any of the&#xD;
      first three new patients in the first course, at least three additional new patients will be&#xD;
      treated. If no further DLT is encountered, dose escalation will proceed. Alternately, if DLT&#xD;
      is noted in one or more of three additional patients, dose escalation will be terminated and&#xD;
      the MTD will be defined as the highest dose level at which none of the first three patients&#xD;
      or no more than one of six patients experienced DLT in course 1. All patients receiving doses&#xD;
      exceeding the confirmed MTD will have their dose reduced to the MTD; even if apparently&#xD;
      tolerating their current dose. Intra-patient dose escalation of ON 01910.Na will be&#xD;
      permitted. There will be no limit to the number of courses that could be administered to a&#xD;
      patient who is both tolerating and benefiting from therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Escalation to the next dose level will occur only after the third evaluable patient (or&#xD;
      sixth, if an expanded cohort), on the previous dose level has been observed for 4 weeks. Dose&#xD;
      escalation decisions will be made by a Cohort Review Committee (CRC). Intra-patient dose&#xD;
      escalation of ON 01910.Na will be allowed after the third evaluable patient on the next dose&#xD;
      level has been observed for 4 weeks with acceptable tolerability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once the MTD has been defined, an expanded cohort of 9 to 12 additional patients (depending&#xD;
      if 3 or 6 patients were enrolled on the previous cohort) will be enrolled at the MTD dose&#xD;
      level in order to further define the safety and tolerability of this regimen, and&#xD;
      characterize the pharmacokinetics of ON 01910.Na alone and after gemcitabine, and perform a&#xD;
      tumor biomarker study.&#xD;
