      To use Cook balloon uterine stent to prevent intrauterine adhesion (IUA), and to see if&#xD;
      leaving it in the uterus will cause uterine infection.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Background：Intrauterine adhesion (IUA) can cause infertility. Hysteroscopic surgery can&#xD;
      effectively treat most IUA. In order to prevent adhesion reformation after surgery, most&#xD;
      gynecologists will prescribe high-dose estrogen to stimulate endometrial growth, and leave an&#xD;
      IUD or a Foley catheter in uterus for 1-3 months. But neither IUD nor Foley catheter conform&#xD;
      to the uterine cavity. The Cook balloon uterine stent was designed to fit into the uterine&#xD;
      cavity. But it was designed to tamponade the uterus to prevent post-operative uterine&#xD;
      bleeding. It's not known if it can be left in the uterus for 30 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design：Uterine culture was done before hysteroscopic surgery, and 30 days later. The&#xD;
      study group comprise patients with uterine stent; the control group comprise patients who&#xD;
      undergo hysteroscopic surgeries but without uterine stent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Method：Immediately before hysteroscopic surgery, a culture tip is inserted into the uterine&#xD;
      cavity and sent for culture. Another culture was done 30 days later, and a second-look&#xD;
      hysteroscope is done to evaluate the healing of uterine cavity. The removed uterine stent was&#xD;
      sent for bacterial culture too. The same procedures are done for patients with and without&#xD;
      uterine stent. The bacterial counts will be compared before and after hysterosocpic&#xD;
      surgeries, and between the two groups of patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Effect：If leaving the uterine stent in the uterus up to 30 days does not cause bacteria to&#xD;
      grow, we can be confident to leave the stent for 30 days.&#xD;
