    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the efficacy and safety of eslicarbazepine&#xD;
      acetate (BIA 2-093) as monotherapy for patients with newly diagnosed partial-onset seizures.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Epilepsy affects more than 50 million adults and children worldwide. Prevalence estimates in&#xD;
      the total population vary from 4 to 8 per 1000 subjects. Anti-epileptic drugs (AEDs) are the&#xD;
      major intervention and approximately 60% of newly diagnosed patients are seizure free on a&#xD;
      single AED, but about 40% are not satisfactorily controlled and 25% suffer from significant&#xD;
      adverse events (AEs). This lack of seizure control and unsatisfactory tolerability means&#xD;
      there is still a need for new, effective AEDs that can be used as monotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Given the efficacy of ESL in controlling partial onset seizures, the good tolerability and&#xD;
      the convenience of QD dosing instead of twice daily (BID) dosing, ESL could offer a&#xD;
      beneficial alternative as a first-line therapy in patients newly diagnosed with epilepsy&#xD;
      experiencing partial-onset seizures. This study aims to demonstrate the efficacy and safety&#xD;
      of ESL as a monotherapy treatment for this patient population proving non-inferiority to a&#xD;
      standard therapy, Carbamazepine controlled release (CBZ-CR).&#xD;
