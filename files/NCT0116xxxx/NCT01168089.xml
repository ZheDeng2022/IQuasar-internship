      Luminous Medical, the Sponsor is developing a glucose monitor for the critical care setting.&#xD;
      The Sponsor's ultimate goal is to provide a near-continuous blood glucose monitor that&#xD;
      automatically measures glucose. In this study, Luminous will evaluate the performance of the&#xD;
      near-infrared measurement in blood samples collected from patients in the intensive care unit&#xD;
      setting.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Maintenance of tight glycemic control in critically ill patients has been demonstrated to&#xD;
      significantly reduce morbidity and mortality in critical care patients in the OR and ICU&#xD;
      settings. Numerous (&gt;20) peer-reviewed publications have demonstrated the benefits of tight&#xD;
      glycemic control. For example, tight glycemic control has been shown to reduce surgical site&#xD;
      infections by 60% in cardiothoracic surgery patients (Furnary et al., 1999), and has been&#xD;
      shown to reduce overall ICU mortality by 40% with significant reductions in ICU morbidity and&#xD;
      length of stay (Van den Berghe, 2001).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Historically, caregivers treated hyperglycemia (high blood glucose) only when glucose levels&#xD;
      exceeded 220 mg/dL. However, based upon these recent clinical findings, experts now recommend&#xD;
      controlling blood glucose to within the normoglycemic range (80-110 mg/dL). Adherence to such&#xD;
      strict glucose control regimens requires near-continuous monitoring of blood glucose and&#xD;
      frequent adjustment of insulin infusion to achieve normoglycemia while avoiding risk of&#xD;
      hypoglycemia (low blood glucose). Surveys indicate that, in response to this demonstrated&#xD;
      clinical need, more than 50% of US hospitals have now adopted tight glycemic control&#xD;
      protocols for some critical care patients, with an additional 23% expected to adopt such&#xD;
      protocols within the next 12 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently, these TGC protocols require intravenous administration of insulin to achieve and&#xD;
      manage glucose control to within the normoglycemic range. The protocols also mandate frequent&#xD;
      monitoring of patient blood glucose levels by nursing staff. With existing technology, each&#xD;
      test involves removal of a blood sample and testing on handheld meters or blood gas&#xD;
      analyzers. This process is cumbersome, labor intensive, and often disruptive to the patient.&#xD;
      Although hospitals are responding to the identified clinical need, current technology has&#xD;
      limited adoption due to two principal reasons:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Fear of hypoglycemia: administering insulin to maintain the patient in the target&#xD;
           glucose range of 80-110 mg/dL exposes the patient to increased risk clinical&#xD;
           hypoglycemia (blood glucose less than 50 mg/dL). Critical care patients are often&#xD;
           sedated and do not exhibit typical signs of hypoglycemia, exacerbating the risk of&#xD;
           hypoglycemia. The need for frequent monitoring and concern about risk of hypoglycemia&#xD;
           increase caregiver stress and can limit adherence to tight glycemic control protocols.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Glucose monitoring by conventional methods represents a burdensome procedure: most tight&#xD;
           glycemic control protocols require frequent glucose monitoring and insulin adjustment at&#xD;
           30 minute to 2 hour intervals (typically hourly) to avoid hypoglycemia while maintaining&#xD;
           normoglycemia. Glucose determination with current technology (including instrument&#xD;
           preparation, blood sample acquisition and instrument analysis) typically takes 5 minutes&#xD;
           per measurement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Sponsor is developing an automated patient-attached blood glucose monitor that will&#xD;
      automatically make frequent blood glucose measurements. Frequent measurements will allow&#xD;
      better tracking of patient glucose status and will provide blood glucose trend information.&#xD;
      The system will alert caregivers to impending or actual hypoglycemia conditions. Automation&#xD;
      will reduce the labor burden associated with existing technology. The device is intended to&#xD;
      help caregivers to better manage tight glycemic control in their patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The device measures glucose in whole blood by flowing a patient blood sample through an&#xD;
      optical flow cell while transmitting near infrared light through the sample. The blood&#xD;
      constituents, including glucose, absorb a portion of the near-infrared energy in&#xD;
      characteristic fashion. The instrument measures the resulting transmission spectrum and&#xD;
      analyzes the spectrum to determine the concentration of glucose in the blood sample.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Though the proposed study will represent the initial measurements made by the device in ICU&#xD;
      patients, the Sponsor has collected data in volunteer studies conducted at InLight's&#xD;
      facility. In one study, we collected blood from volunteer donors and created individual blood&#xD;
      samples with variable glucose (glucose range 50-550 mg/dL) by spiking the samples with&#xD;
      concentrated glucose solution. We also induced hematocrit variation between 30-50% in these&#xD;
      samples by controlling the red cell to plasma ratio. Spectral measurements collected with the&#xD;
      prototype device were mathematically correlated with simultaneous blood glucose measurements&#xD;
      of the same samples obtained with a Yellow Springs Instruments YSI 2700 Select glucose&#xD;
      analyzer (an industry-standard laboratory glucose analyzer) to generate a spectral glucose&#xD;
      model and to provide baseline near-infrared glucose measurement results. This evaluation&#xD;
      demonstrated that the device's glucose measurements tracked the YSI 2700 glucose measurements&#xD;
      with an accuracy of 8.9 mg/dL (1 s.d.). See Figure 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In another study, we collected serial blood samples from 5 volunteer subjects with diabetes&#xD;
      undergoing dynamic glucose changes induced by carbohydrate ingestion and insulin&#xD;
      administration. We obtained spectral glucose measurements of the blood samples using the&#xD;
      prototype near-infrared device and compared them with simultaneous blood glucose measurements&#xD;
      of the same samples obtained with the YSI 2700 Select glucose analyzer. The Sponsor's results&#xD;
      compared favorably with the YSI 2700 results, demonstrating a root-mean-squared error (1&#xD;
      standard deviation) of 5.9 mg/dL (Figure 2). This accuracy level is comparable to current&#xD;
      handheld meter technology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We anticipate that the OR and ICU environments will present new physiological and&#xD;
      pharmacological challenges for our instrument. The proposed study is essentially a screening&#xD;
      study that will give the Sponsor insight into these challenges. Access to the de-identified&#xD;
      ICU charts will allow the Sponsor to correlate the glucose measurements and measurement&#xD;
      errors with specific pharmacologic therapies and physiological events. In this manner, the&#xD;
      proposed study is in effect a screening study.&#xD;
