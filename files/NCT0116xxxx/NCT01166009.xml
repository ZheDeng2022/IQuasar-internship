      The primary purpose of the Research Database is to have a comprehensive source of&#xD;
      observational data that can be used to study HSC transplantation and cellular therapies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A secondary purpose of the Research Database is to have a comprehensive source of data to&#xD;
      study marrow toxic injuries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To learn more about what makes stem cell transplants and cellular therapies work well such&#xD;
      as:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine how well recipients recover from their transplants or cellular therapy;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine how recovery after a transplant or cellular therapy can be improved;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine how a donor's or recipient's genetics impact recipient recovery after a&#xD;
           transplant or cellular therapy;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine how access to transplant or cellular therapy for different groups of patients&#xD;
           can be improved;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine how well donors recover from the collection procedures.&#xD;

        Eligibility to Participate in the Research Database&#xD;
&#xD;
        Recipient Eligibility Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any recipient of an unrelated or related donor or autologous HSC transplant in a&#xD;
             CIBMTR center is eligible to participate in the Research Database. This includes&#xD;
             adults with and without decision making capacity, and children.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Individual with Marrow Toxic Injury Eligibility Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any individual who is treated for a marrow toxic injury at a center participating in&#xD;
             the NMDP's Radiation Injury Transplant Network (RITN) is eligible to participate in&#xD;
             the Research Database. This includes adults with and without decision making capacity,&#xD;
             and children. Eligible individuals may have received supportive care only, growth&#xD;
             factor support, HSC transplant or other appropriate medical treatment for marrow toxic&#xD;
             injury. Treatments applied are at the discretion of the care facility, and are not&#xD;
             determined by the NMDP or CIBMTR.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Unrelated Donor Eligibility Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  All donors registered on the NMDP Registry who have been requested to donate a product&#xD;
             for a recipient are eligible to participate in the Research Database.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  All maternal cord blood donors are enrolled in the NMDP Cord Blood Bank&#xD;
             Investigational New Drug (IND) protocol, and sign an informed consent document&#xD;
             specific to that protocol. Data collected as part of the Cord Blood Bank protocol are&#xD;
             included in the Research Database.&#xD;
