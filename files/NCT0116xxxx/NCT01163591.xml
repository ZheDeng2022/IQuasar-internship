  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a metabolic disorder commonly encountered by the healthcare&#xD;
      professionals. Diabetic nephropathy is one of its complications, which is becoming the most&#xD;
      common cause of end-stage renal failure in Hong Kong. As of March 31, 2000, a total of 1026&#xD;
      patients with diabetes were on renal replacement therapy and the number is steadily&#xD;
      increasing. According to ADA guidelines, screening for diabetic nephropathy should be&#xD;
      performed on an annual basis to assess urine albumin excretion rate. Serum creatinine should&#xD;
      also be measured in all diabetic patients regardless of the degree of urine albumin excretion&#xD;
      rate. Timed urinary collection can be a cumbersome procedure for patients and a simpler and&#xD;
      fast test that maintains reasonable sensitivity is called for. A tool that is non-invasive&#xD;
      and able to identify patients with early nephropathy changes would be valuable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The skin has been found to have the potential to provide an important non-invasive route for&#xD;
      diagnostic monitoring of human subjects for a wide range of applications. eZscanÂ® technology&#xD;
      is a patented active electrophysiological technology which uses low level DC-inducing reverse&#xD;
      iontophoresis, together with chronoamperometry, to evaluate the behaviour of the tissues in&#xD;
      specific locations of the body. This non invasive test is a potential tool for the screening&#xD;
      for diabetic nephropathy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to compare eZscan with the standard methods of screening for&#xD;
      diabetic nephropathy in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.&#xD;

      Patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus with and without diabetic nephropathy will be&#xD;
      identified from clinical records and approached for their interest in participating in the&#xD;
      study. Written informed consent will be obtained from patients who qualify according to the&#xD;
      eligibility criteria and agree to join the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Male or female aged between 21 and 75 years (inclusive).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Has confirmed type 2 diabetes mellitus&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. With or without diabetic nephropathy based on recent complication screening&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Written informed consent given&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Has amputation of arm or leg&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Uses beta blockers or drugs known to affect the sympathetic nervous system&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Has an electrical implantable device (pacemaker, defibrillator)&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Known to have sensitivity to nickel or any other standard electrodes&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Sufferers from epilepsy or seizures&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Patients on renal replacement therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Patients with chronic kidney disease due to known non-diabetes causes e.g. renal stone&#xD;
           or obstructive uropathy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. Patients confirmed to have urinary tract infection on the day of assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary endpoint:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The optimal eZscan unit to detect the presence of diabetic nephropathy as defined by&#xD;
           eGFR and ACR using ROC analysis, sensitivity and specificity values.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Other analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. A prediction algorithm using age, sex, body mass index and eZcan score will be developed&#xD;
           to predict eGFR as continuous and categorical variables using Cox regression analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Students t test and analysis of variance will be used to compare the eZcan values&#xD;
           between patients with and those without diabetic nephropathy with age and sex adjustment&#xD;
           Frequency of adverse events will also be listed.&#xD;
