      Specific Aim 1 is to test the hypothesis that there are specific characteristics of a voice&#xD;
      smoke alarm (i.e., use of child's first name, behavior commands in the message content, use&#xD;
      of mother's voice, and stimulus frequency) that will awaken children 5-12 years old in stage&#xD;
      4 sleep. The successful children's alarm will be tested among adult subjects to evaluate&#xD;
      effectiveness across the age spectrum.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 2 is to test the hypothesis that there are specific characteristics of a voice&#xD;
      smoke alarm (i.e., use of mother's voice and behavior commands in the message content) that&#xD;
      will result in successful completion of simulated escape behaviors by children 5-12 years old&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Being asleep at the time of a residential fire is an important risk factor for fire-related&#xD;
      death. Children 5-12 years of age are unlikely to be awakened by a conventional residential&#xD;
      tone smoke alarm in the event of a fire. However, findings from our preliminary research&#xD;
      strongly suggest that an effective and practical alarm for this age group is achievable.&#xD;
      Building on our previous work, the objective of this study is to determine key smoke alarm&#xD;
      characteristics that will awaken children and prompt their escape. We will achieve our study&#xD;
      objective through two specific aims.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 1 is to test the hypothesis that there are specific characteristics of a voice&#xD;
      smoke alarm (i.e., use of child's first name, behavior commands in the message content, use&#xD;
      of mother's voice, and stimulus frequency) that will awaken children 5-12 years old in stage&#xD;
      4 sleep. The successful children's alarm will be tested among adult subjects to evaluate&#xD;
      effectiveness across the age spectrum.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 2 is to test the hypothesis that there are specific characteristics of a voice&#xD;
      smoke alarm (i.e., use of mother's voice and behavior commands in the message content) that&#xD;
      will result in successful completion of simulated escape behaviors by children 5-12 years old&#xD;
      after awakening from stage 4 sleep. The successful children's alarm will be tested among&#xD;
      adult subjects to evaluate effectiveness across the age spectrum.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Using a randomized, non-blinded, repeated measures, clinical intervention design, our two&#xD;
      working hypotheses as stated in Specific Aims 1 and 2 will be tested in five linked studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study 1. Identification of Specific Maternal Voice Smoke Alarm Characteristics Associated&#xD;
      With Awakening and Escaping.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Using a randomized, non-blinded, repeated measures, clinical intervention design, Study 1&#xD;
      will identify the critical elements (i.e., use of child's first name and/or behavior commands&#xD;
      in message content) in the maternal voice signal that are significantly associated with&#xD;
      EEG-defined awakening (and completion of simulated escape behaviors by children after&#xD;
      awakening from S4). A conventional residential tone smoke alarm meeting current NFPA 72&#xD;
      National Fire Alarm Code will be used as a reference stimulus to allow comparison of&#xD;
      responses to the voice alarm stimuli with responses to a conventional residential tone alarm&#xD;
      stimulus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Alarm stimuli are being tested during S4 in our study, because this is the deepest stage of&#xD;
      sleep and the most refractory to arousal. If alarm stimuli are successful in awakening&#xD;
      children from S4 and prompting them to escape, then these stimuli will be expected to be at&#xD;
      least this successful during other stages of sleep. We want to develop an alarm that provides&#xD;
      an effective stimulus for sleeping children at highest risk of non-response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During Study 1, subjects will be randomly assigned to a sequence of four alarm stimuli using&#xD;
      a Latin Square design, which will minimize the possibility of a sequence effect. Block&#xD;
      randomization by age range (5-6, 7-8, 9-10, 11-12 years) and gender will be used to ensure&#xD;
      that these two variables are equally represented in each of the sequences. A different alarm&#xD;
      stimulus will be given during each S4 period of the first and second sleep cycles on two&#xD;
      separate non-consecutive nights. Consecutive nights of testing will not be done to avoid&#xD;
      possible confounding effects of sleep deprivation. This study's repeated measures design&#xD;
      avoids potential confounding effects due to variation of AATs among individuals&#xD;
      (inter-subject variability) and takes advantage of the stability of AATs for an individual&#xD;
      among sleep cycles during a night and from night to night (intra-subject variability)&#xD;
      (Bonnet, et al., 1978; Zepelin, et al., 1984; Bruck, 2001).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study 2. Comparison of Mother's Versus Stranger's Voice Smoke Alarms and Alarm Frequency.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study 2 will take the voice alarm script that was the most successful in Study 1 in awakening&#xD;
      and prompting children to perform the simulated escape behaviors, and will compare mother's&#xD;
      voice to a female stranger's voice using this script. This will determine whether mother's&#xD;
      voice is a critical factor for success of the voice smoke alarm. In addition, a&#xD;
      Temporal-Three (T-3) pattern smoke alarm with dominant tones in lower frequency ranges&#xD;
      similar to the human voice range will be included as a stimulus in Study 2 to evaluate the&#xD;
      influence of alarm signal frequency on EEG-defined awakening (as well as completion of&#xD;
      simulated escape behaviors by children after awakening from S4). As in Study 1, a&#xD;
      conventional residential tone smoke alarm will be used as a reference stimulus in Study 2.&#xD;
      This conventional residential tone alarm has a higher frequency signal than the other T-3&#xD;
      tone alarm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If more than one alarm script ties for the most effective in Study 1, then the script that is&#xD;
      the least personalized will be used in Study 2. This decision rule is based on injury&#xD;
      prevention theory (Baker, 1981) that dictates that a voice alarm that requires the least&#xD;
      effort by the parent (to personalize the script with the child's name in this case) will be&#xD;
      more likely to be implemented. Indeed, the voice alarm that would be most likely to be used&#xD;
      by parents, and the most likely to be used correctly, is one that requires no personalization&#xD;
      at all. For example, if a voice alarm with a pre-recorded, effective, fire&#xD;
      safety-appropriate, urgent evacuation message (equivalent to &quot;Wake up! Get out of bed! Leave&#xD;
      the room!&quot; by the female stranger's voice in this proposed study) could be purchased, and&#xD;
      installed by parents directly from its package, it would be the most likely to result in the&#xD;
      needed protection. If our study demonstrates that personalization of an alarm message (by use&#xD;
      of the child's first name and mother's voice) is not associated with improved awakening and&#xD;
      escaping, then this could eliminate the need for a recording mechanism in a voice smoke&#xD;
      alarm, such as currently found in the KidSmart alarm. Decreasing the technical complexity of&#xD;
      the alarm will bring down the price, which could increase its use in lower income homes at&#xD;
      higher risk of residential fire.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The lower frequency T-3 alarm that will be used in this Study 2 is a Simplex 1996, 4100 Fire&#xD;
      Alarm with a fundamental frequency at 500Hz with additional dominant frequencies at 1500Hz&#xD;
      and 2500Hz. This is the same alarm previously used by Proulx and Laroche (2003) and Bruck, et&#xD;
      al. (2004). Although use of this alarm does not evaluate the influence of alteration of the&#xD;
      frequency of the voice alarm stimulus on awakening, it does allow for testing the effects of&#xD;
      alarm frequency on awakening by comparing the success of the lower frequency T-3 alarm with&#xD;
      the other alarms in Study 2. Since July 1996, the NFPA 72 National Fire Alarm Code has&#xD;
      required that buildings equipped with a fire alarm system must sound the Temporal-Three (T-3)&#xD;
      pattern as defined by ISO 8201 (International Organization for Standardization, 1987). The&#xD;
      international standard addresses the signal's length, sound pressure level, and temporal&#xD;
      aspects, but does not stipulate requirements for signal frequency. However, Bruck, et al.&#xD;
      (2004) have suggested that alarm frequency may be the key factor in awakening sleeping&#xD;
      children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Using the same design as in Study 1, subjects in Study 2 will be block randomized by age&#xD;
      range and gender to a sequence of four alarm stimuli using a Latin Square design. Using a&#xD;
      repeated measures design, a different alarm stimulus will be given during each S4 period of&#xD;
      the first and second sleep cycles on two separate non-consecutive nights.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study 3. Active Comparator: Adults 20-49 Years of Age Using a randomized, non-blinded,&#xD;
      repeated measures, clinical intervention design, our two working hypotheses as stated in&#xD;
      Specific Aims 1 and 2 will be tested in a linked study, Study 3, with adult participants&#xD;
      20-49 years of age to ensure that the alarms tested will also work for adults in this age&#xD;
      group. This arm will use the alarm signal identified in Study 2 that is significantly&#xD;
      associated with Electroencephalography (EEG)-defined awakening and successful completion of&#xD;
      simulated escape behaviors by children after awakening from slow wave sleep. A lower&#xD;
      frequency tone smoke alarm will evaluate the influence of alarm signal frequency on&#xD;
      awakening. A conventional residential tone smoke alarm will be used as a reference stimulus.&#xD;
      Both a male and a female voice will be used as alarm stimuli. Note that these will be&#xD;
      strangers' voices, and not a mother's voice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study 4. Active Comparator: Older Adults 60-84 Years of Age Study 4 of this project will take&#xD;
      the voice alarm script in Study 2 and compare it with a low-frequency 520 Hz square wave tone&#xD;
      smoke alarm in awakening older adults 60-84 years of age from slow wave sleep and prompting&#xD;
      their performance of a simulated escape procedure. Note that this will necessarily be a&#xD;
      female stranger's voice, and not a mother's voice, in this older age group. As in Studies 1&#xD;
      and 2, a conventional residential tone smoke alarm will be used as a reference stimulus in&#xD;
      Study 4. In order to maintain the same experimental design across these studies, a fourth&#xD;
      alarm type will be introduced. This fourth alarm will be a hybrid of the low-frequency 520 Hz&#xD;
      square wave tone smoke alarm and the voice alarm, i.e., the stimulus will begin with the 520&#xD;
      Hz square wave tone in a T-3 pattern followed by the voice script, with this stimulus being&#xD;
      repeated until the subject completes the escape procedure. The simulated escape procedure for&#xD;
      older adults will be different from that of the child and adult (20-49 years of age) studies&#xD;
      (Studies 1, 2, and 3). It will consist of the participant sitting up in his/her bed and&#xD;
      pressing a button anchored to the wall beside the bed to stop the alarm. This will avoid any&#xD;
      concerns of falls in this older age group upon awakening.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study 5. Children 5-12 Years of Age (Testing Male Voice and Hybrid Tone/Voice Alarm) Using a&#xD;
      randomized, non-blinded, repeated measures, clinical intervention design, our two working&#xD;
      hypotheses as stated in Specific Aims 1 and 2 will be tested in Study 5 among children 5-12&#xD;
      years of age using the following 4 alarm stimuli: female stranger's voice, male stranger's&#xD;
      voice, hybrid of the low-frequency 520 Hz square wave tone smoke alarm and the voice alarm&#xD;
      (from Study 4), and conventional high frequency tone residential alarm. This study arm will&#xD;
      allow comparison of a male versus female voice and also evaluate the hybrid low frequency&#xD;
      tone/voice alarm among children 5-12 years of age. The same protocol will be used for&#xD;
      children in this study arm as was used in Studies 1 and 2.&#xD;
