  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      By using stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) delivered with the Cyberknife system®,&#xD;
      the current protocol attempts to mimic or improve the excellent local control rates seen in&#xD;
      treatment of early stage breast cancer while attempting to increase convenience, limit&#xD;
      invasiveness, decrease toxicity, and improve cosmesis compared to other methods of radiation&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;

    <description>3 dose cohorts. Patients in each dose cohort will all be treated as a single group for dose escalation. The starting dose for the dose escalation portion will be 6 Gy per fraction for 5 fractions (total dose = 30 Gy). Subsequent cohorts of patients will receive an additional 0.5 Gy per treatment (total 2.5 Gy per escalation).</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  DCIS or invasive ductal, medullary, papillary, mucinous (colloid), or tubular&#xD;
             histologies.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Eligible patients must have appropriate staging studies identifying them as AJCC stage&#xD;
             T1 or T2 (≤3 cm) treated with lumpectomy and axillary node dissection with at least 6&#xD;
             nodes sampled or sentinel node biopsy. Patients with up to 3 positive nodes without&#xD;
             microscopic or macroscopic evidence of extracapsular extension are eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The patient's Zubrod performance status must be 0-2.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must be ≥ 18 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  If chemotherapy is planned, it must begin no earlier than two weeks following&#xD;
             completion of radiation therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Unifocal breast cancer (no evidence of gross multifocal disease, multicentric, or&#xD;
             bilateral disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Negative margins after lumpectomy (re-excision for initial positive margins is&#xD;
             allowed-negative margins defined as &gt;2 mm clear of tumor in all directions).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Negative post- lumpectomy mammography if malignancy-associated microcalcifications&#xD;
             were initially present.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The target lumpectomy cavity must be clearly delineated.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must complete appropriate pretreatment evaluation, including post-lumpectomy&#xD;
             mammogram if microcalcifications were initially present to confirm complete removal.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Evidence of suspicious microcalcifications in the breast prior to start of radiation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with history of collagen vascular disease, specifically dermatomyositis with&#xD;
             a CPK level above normal or active skin rash, systemic lupus erythematosis, or&#xD;
             scleroderma.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with 4 or more histologically positive axillary nodes if axillary dissection&#xD;
             is performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with distant metastases.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with invasive or extensive in-situ lobular carcinoma or non-epithelial breast&#xD;
             malignancies such as sarcoma or lymphoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with multicentric gross disease defined as tumors in different quadrants of&#xD;
             the breast or tumor separated by at least 4 cm or other clinically or radiographically&#xD;
             suspicious areas in the ipsilateral breast unless confirmed to be negative for&#xD;
             malignancy or biopsy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must not have any palpable or radiographically suspicious ipsilateral or&#xD;
             contralateral axillary, supraclavicular, infraclavicular, or internal mammary nodes&#xD;
             unless there is histologic confirmation that these nodes are negative for tumor.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any previously treated contralateral invasive breast carcinoma or synchronous&#xD;
             contralateral breast carcinoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prior non-hormonal therapy or radiation therapy for the current breast cancer or&#xD;
             hormonal therapy for &gt; 28 days after diagnosis or refusal to discontinue hormonal&#xD;
             therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with Paget's disease of the nipple&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with prior invasive malignancy (except non-melanomatous skin cancer) unless&#xD;
             disease free for a minimum of 3 years (e.g., carcinoma in situ of the breast, oral&#xD;
             cavity, or cervix are all permissible).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with severe, active co-morbidity.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with psychiatric or addictive disorders that, in the opinion of the&#xD;
             investigator, would preclude obtaining informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who are pregnant or lactating.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Previous breast radiation on either side or thoracic radiation on the ipsilateral&#xD;
             side..&#xD;
