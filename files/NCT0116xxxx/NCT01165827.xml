      1. Research aims&#xD;
&#xD;
           The increasing prevalence of severe aortic valve defects is a corollary to increases in&#xD;
           life expectancy. For many years, surgical valve replacement with extracorporeal&#xD;
           circulation has been the gold standard in the treatment of severe aortic valve diseases.&#xD;
           Every year, about 12,000 patients in Germany receive isolated aortic valve surgery.&#xD;
           Several alternatives to established procedures have recently emerged:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  V-TAVI, vascular transcatheter aortic valve implantation and&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  A-TAVI, apical transcatheter aortic valve implantation. For some time, percutaneous&#xD;
                balloon valvuloplasty has been used as a palliative measure for specific patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
           New developments have triggered assumptions that there will over the coming years be a&#xD;
           certain reorientation to the treatment of patients with aortic valve defects. In a&#xD;
           positioning paper published jointly by the German Cardiac Society (DGK) and the German&#xD;
           Society for Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery (DGTHG), there is a consensus that these&#xD;
           new techniques can be used on patients who have either contraindications against&#xD;
           conventional surgery or who are at high risk of preoperative mortality, e.g. due to&#xD;
           severe comorbidities.&#xD;
&#xD;
           As there is as yet only limited experience in this field and neither randomised trials&#xD;
           nor long-term-results are available, the use of new implantation techniques is therefore&#xD;
           not recommended for younger patients or patients without comorbidities. There is&#xD;
           accordingly an urgent need for any introduction of this innovative medical procedure to&#xD;
           be stringently monitored according to scientific principles. The goal of the planned&#xD;
           Germany Aortic Valve Register is to evaluate the new treatments from the point of view&#xD;
           of benefits und risks with respect to the gold standard of conventional surgery, with a&#xD;
           view to compiling evidence-based indication criteria. The register will furthermore&#xD;
           allow for the first time a comparison of various operative procedures, such as Ross&#xD;
           procedure, David procedure and various mechanical or biological aortic valve implants.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Rationale of the study design Randomised trials in controlled environments are&#xD;
           considered best scientific practice for verifying the efficacy of a new method. The&#xD;
           disadvantage is that only a small part of potential patients can be included in the&#xD;
           trial, and results therefore reflect only a small section of the real world.&#xD;
           Furthermore, a randomised study design is for ethical reasons not an acceptable approach&#xD;
           to all questions, especially when contraindications exist for a certain branch of&#xD;
           treatments and the spectrum of treatments is to be expanded. Nevertheless, new&#xD;
           procedures have to be critically and scientifically analysed if the risk-benefit ratio&#xD;
           is to be accurately determined. National heath authorities therefore request register&#xD;
           data in addition to controlled trials in order to verify the safety and efficacy of new&#xD;
           procedures across larger patient populations.&#xD;
&#xD;

      1. Research aims&#xD;
&#xD;
      The increasing prevalence of severe aortic valve defects is a corollary to increases in life&#xD;
      expectancy (Lindroos et al. 1993). For many years, surgical valve replacement with&#xD;
      extracorporeal circulation has been the gold standard in the treatment of severe aortic valve&#xD;
      diseases. Every year, about 12,000 patients in Germany receive isolated aortic valve surgery&#xD;
      (Gummert et al. 2009). Several alternatives to established procedures have recently emerged:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  V-TAVI, vascular transcatheter aortic valve implantation and&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A-TAVI, apical transcatheter aortic valve implantation (Cribier et al. 2002, Walther et&#xD;
           al. 2008, Webb et al. 2007, Himbert et al. 2008, Walther et al. 2007).&#xD;
&#xD;
      For some time, percutaneous balloon valvuloplasty (Sack et al. 2008) has been used as a&#xD;
      palliative measure for specific patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      New developments have triggered assumptions that there will over the coming years be a&#xD;
      certain reorientation to the treatment of patients with aortic valve defects. In a&#xD;
      positioning paper published jointly by the German Cardiac Society (DGK) and the German&#xD;
      Society for Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery (DGTHG), there is a consensus that these new&#xD;
      techniques can be used on patients who have either contraindications against conventional&#xD;
      surgery or who are at high risk of preoperative mortality, e.g. due to severe comorbidities&#xD;
      (Figulla et al. 2009).&#xD;
&#xD;
      As there is as yet only limited experience in this field and neither randomised trials nor&#xD;
      long-term-results are available, the use of new implantation techniques is therefore not&#xD;
      recommended for younger patients or patients without comorbidities (Figulla et al. 2009).&#xD;
      There is accordingly an urgent need for any introduction of this innovative medical procedure&#xD;
      to be stringently monitored according to scientific principles. The goal of the planned&#xD;

      benefits und risks with respect to the gold standard of conventional surgery, with a view to&#xD;
      compiling evidence-based indication criteria. The register will furthermore allow for the&#xD;

&#xD;

&#xD;

&#xD;
           4. Study design Prospective, controlled, multicenter register study&#xD;
&#xD;
           5. Inclusion criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
           All consecutive patients from participating hospitals with aortic valve defects who have&#xD;
           received one of the following therapies:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. surgical aortic valve replacement,&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. aortic valve surgery (Ross procedure, David procedure)&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. percutaneous transvascular (retrograde) aortic valve implantation&#xD;
&#xD;
             4. percutaneous transapical aortic valve implantation&#xD;
&#xD;
             5. aortic valve valvuloplasty&#xD;
&#xD;
           6. Variables of measurement&#xD;
&#xD;
           ‚Ä¢ Clinical short term and long term results (event free survival) after 30 days, one&#xD;
           year and after 3 and 5 years&#xD;
&#xD;
           ‚Ä¢ Indication for the various procedures&#xD;
&#xD;
           ‚Ä¢ Documentation of surgical risk and quality of life&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Documentation of technical performance and the success of the intervention,&#xD;
                including re-interventions&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Documentation of in-hospital mortality and non-fatal severe complications&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Documentation of medication at discharge / long-term medication&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Documentation of implants used&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Documentation of length of stay in hospital and rehabilitation&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Documentation of mortality and non-fatal severe complications, re-intervention,&#xD;
                re-hospitalisation, as well as medication within 30 days, one year and after 3 and&#xD;
                5 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
                7. Statistical methods / evaluation plan All collected parameters are analysed&#xD;
                descriptively for the entire study population for each of the included therapies&#xD;
                (see: 5. Inclusion criteria). The absolute value and the percentage of the quality&#xD;
                data are reported. For continuous variables median and quantities will be&#xD;
                presented. Event free survival will be visualised through Kaplan-Meier graphs. The&#xD;
                descriptive analysis of main measurement variables helps to illustrate the quality&#xD;
                of the various techniques of aortic valve replacement from a structure, process and&#xD;
                outcome point of view (objective a.).&#xD;
&#xD;
           Within the different types of therapy, predictors for surgery/intervention without&#xD;
           complications, and therefore also mortality, as well as improvement of quality of life&#xD;
           will be ascertained through regression models. The results of these calculations will be&#xD;
           used to detect criteria for indicating the various techniques (objective b.).&#xD;
&#xD;
           Within the various techniques, alternative medical devices will be compared in respect&#xD;
           to mortality and quality of life. Propensity-score models can be used for adjustment&#xD;
           purposes (objective c.).&#xD;
&#xD;
           All participating centres will receive a benchmark report once a year in which the&#xD;
           patients of the respective centre will be compared to those in other hospitals. The&#xD;
           report will distinguish between the various techniques of aortic valve replacement.&#xD;
&#xD;
           In addition to a descriptive comparison, all complications will be reported&#xD;
           risk-adjusted for each centre and analysed from the point of view of the centre-related&#xD;
           effect (objective d.).&#xD;
&#xD;
           An adjusted comparison of different types of therapies in respect to complications, cost&#xD;
           and patients' quality of life through statistical methods will not be undertaken until&#xD;
           the patient population of the various techniques overlap each other at least partially&#xD;
           with regard to predictors for complications, costs and quality of life. This is to be&#xD;
           examined during the development of the first report.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The following data will be needed for evaluation from a health-economy point of view&#xD;
           (objective e.):&#xD;
&#xD;
           Demographical data, details regarding intervention, complications in the context of the&#xD;
           intervention, clinical outcome parameters, quality of life (on the basis of a&#xD;
           standardised questionnaire), medication, consulting of general practitioners and&#xD;
           specialists, hospitalisation, rehabilitation measures, dependence on long term care&#xD;
           (care level), employment as well as inability to work and reduction of earning capacity.&#xD;
&#xD;
           A price for the consumption of resources will be determined after data are collected.&#xD;
           This will allow a monetary value to be put on consumption of resources and calculation&#xD;
           of the incurred expenses. It may in this context be necessary to incorporate a time&#xD;
           factor in consumption in the form of a country-specific and sector-specific inflation&#xD;
           adjustment of the costs in relation to a base year.&#xD;
&#xD;
           This provides the possibility of analysing costs with regard to the chosen procedures&#xD;
           (see: 5. Inclusion criteria). It is furthermore planned to run a&#xD;
           cost-effectiveness-analysis in close cooperation with clinical experts, in which the&#xD;
           costs of the procedures will be set against clinical effects achieved in a&#xD;
           cost-effectiveness relation (ICER). Additionally, a cost-utility analysis will be&#xD;
           conducted wherever possible. The costs of the various treatments will thereby be set in&#xD;
           relation to so-called quality adjusted life years (QALYs), a combined endpoint&#xD;
           consisting of quality of life and length of life. The survey of quality of life through&#xD;
           a structured questionnaire allows quality of life to be presented in an index.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The goal of the accompanying health economic research is therefore to provide a&#xD;
           comparison of monitored therapy alternatives from the point of view of clinical and&#xD;
           economic effectiveness.&#xD;
&#xD;
           It has to be emphasised that a differentiated approach must be taken to any comparison&#xD;
           of individual groups due to the absence of randomisation. Matching will be undertaken to&#xD;
           minimise selection bias. Due to particularly high differences in the patient&#xD;
           collectives, the question of whether it is possible to apply these methods to the&#xD;
           anticipated data can not be conclusively answered until the data records have been&#xD;
           received.&#xD;
&#xD;
           8. Data model The register provides a complete survey. The data model is based on three&#xD;
           data sources.&#xD;
&#xD;
           1. Data set of the external performance measurement according to the German Social Code&#xD;
           (¬ß 137 SGB V): The set provides data on pre-, intra- and postoperative processes during&#xD;
           hospitalisation at the time of surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
           2. Register data set: Additional internet-based survey, e.g. specific indication&#xD;
           criteria and indication for used medical devices 3. Follow-up: Survey of follow-up after&#xD;
           30 days, 1, 3 and 5 years by the registry centre.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The complete data collection is based on the consent of the patients from all hospitals&#xD;
           performing surgical and catheter supported aortic valve procedures. From the point of&#xD;
           view of data protection regulations, this is the safest and most feasible way to obtain&#xD;
           longitudinal data. The completeness of data collection will be tested with an electronic&#xD;
           tool analysing reimbursement data. Monitoring of data validity is carried out by a&#xD;
           multi-stage plausibility check and a data crosscheck on a randomly selected sample&#xD;
           (audit).&#xD;
&#xD;
           9. Period of data collection The phase of patient-recruiting starts on 5 July 2010 and&#xD;
           ends as decided by the Executive Board. Follow-ups take place 30 days, 1 year, 3 and 5&#xD;
           years after the aortic valve procedure. Efforts will be made to achieve a central&#xD;
           follow-up, but this can only be conducted if the written consent of the patient has been&#xD;
           obtained and the hospital agrees to export data to the registry centre.&#xD;
&#xD;
           10. Data management The address of the patient needed for follow-up via telephone will&#xD;
           be kept separately from the medical data of the patient. Only persons in charge of&#xD;
           telephone follow-up will have access to the address of the patient. Only anonymised&#xD;
           medical patient data will be used for statistical analysis. Personal data will be&#xD;
           anonymised immediately after the database is closed and will be deleted after the last&#xD;
           scientific analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
           For the data transmission of the quality assurance data according ¬ß 137 Social Code book&#xD;
           five to the register, a tool will be made available to the participating centres. For&#xD;
           this purpose, the participating centre will have to conduct an &quot;internal BQS-export&quot;.&#xD;
           The file generated by internal-BQS-export includes all identification characteristics by&#xD;
           which a combination of the data sets according ¬ß 137 Social Code book five and the&#xD;
           e-sheet data-sets is possible.&#xD;
&#xD;
           This will ensure that only data receiving the written consent of the patient will be&#xD;
           transmitted to the register.&#xD;
&#xD;
           11. Benchmark reports During the period of routine operation of the register all&#xD;
           participating hospitals will receive benchmark reports at least once a year. The reports&#xD;
           will be conducted individually for each hospital and compare data of the respective&#xD;
           hospital with data from all other hospitals. The collected data will be analysed in&#xD;
           respect to characteristics, therapy and clinical progress of the patients included. This&#xD;
           benchmark system enables internal quality assurance for the participating hospitals.&#xD;
&#xD;
           12. Supporting organisations and funding The register is supported by an Executive Board&#xD;
           consisting of members of the two associations involved and various experts without&#xD;
           voting right. All members have to disclose possible conflicts of interest. The Executive&#xD;
           Board also has the support of the Steering Committee, which has a consultancy role and&#xD;
           to which representatives of the industrials sponsors, insurance companies, health&#xD;
           economic experts and representatives of political decision-making-bodies are invited.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The supporting organisation of the register is the non-profit GmbH Deutsches&#xD;
           Aortenklappenregister (GARY), the official holder of the data from a legal point of&#xD;
           view.&#xD;
&#xD;
           13. Independence of Register A funding agreement with the manufacturers of medical&#xD;
           devices ensures full independence of the Executive Board. A disclosure stipulation&#xD;
           guarantees that all evaluations and publications are conducted solely according to&#xD;
           scientific criteria. This prevents any manipulative influence on publications or the&#xD;
           withholding of publications. The involved societies and the BQS Institute are by virtue&#xD;
           of their statutes autonomous bodies from a professional and scientific point of view.&#xD;
