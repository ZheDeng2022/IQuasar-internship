  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Recent data indicate that approximately one-third of women of childbearing age smoke&#xD;
      cigarettes, and 25-50% of women smoke during pregnancy. Cigarette smoking during pregnancy is&#xD;
      a significant public health issue that can have profound effects on women's health and the&#xD;
      health of their developing fetus. Smoking among pregnant women is associated with high levels&#xD;
      of negative affect, which play a key role in the maintenance of smoking behavior and in&#xD;
      difficulty quitting smoking during pregnancy. Despite the clear role of negative affect in&#xD;
      the maintenance of smoking among pregnant women, and while this issue has received increased&#xD;
      attention by clinicians and researchers, the investigators know of no smoking cessation&#xD;
      intervention that combines coping skills and emotion regulation approaches to address the&#xD;
      role of negative affect in smoking cessation. Smoking cessation treatment strategies that&#xD;
      have demonstrated effectiveness in regular smokers have not translated into effective&#xD;
      treatment strategies for pregnant women, particularly low-income pregnant women. The goal of&#xD;
      this project is to develop and test an affect regulation smoking cessation intervention for&#xD;
      low-income pregnant smokers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The major aims of this project will be addressed in two sequential phases. In Phase 1, the&#xD;
      investigators will develop two 8-session smoking cessation treatment manuals including: (a)&#xD;
      Affect Regulation Training plus Cognitive-Behavioral Treatment (ART+CBT) and (b) a Health and&#xD;
      Lifestyle plus Cognitive-Behavioral Treatment (HLS+CBT) control intervention. In Phase 2, the&#xD;
      investigators will conduct a randomized clinical trial pilot study (Total N = 60) to compare&#xD;
      the ART+CBT and HLS+CBT conditions on: a) the feasibility and acceptability of the&#xD;
      interventions, (b) the impact of these interventions (ART+CBT and HLS+CBT) on smoking&#xD;
      cessation rates at the end of the 8 treatment sessions (these occur approximately 2 months&#xD;
      after treatment initiation) and at the 6-month post-quit date assessment (Session 2 is the&#xD;
      quit date), (c) affect regulation skills, and (d) negative affect among pregnant smokers. The&#xD;
      long-term goal of this proposed research is to increase smoking cessation rates among&#xD;
      pregnant smokers, which would provide significant long-term health benefits for both mothers&#xD;
      and their infants. This Stage 1 application will be used to generate feasibility and&#xD;
      preliminary efficacy data, setting the stage for a Stage II efficacy trial.&#xD;
