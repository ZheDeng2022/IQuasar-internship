      The goal of this part (Part 1) of this clinical research study is to learn about the safety&#xD;
      of giving 2 doses of SCH 72105 (also known as rAd-IFN) directly into the bladder to patients&#xD;
      with bladder cancer that has come back. The goal of Part 2 of this study is to learn about&#xD;
      the safety of giving 2 more doses of SCH 72105 directly into the bladder of Part 1&#xD;
      participants who had no sign of bladder cancer after Week 12. The level of effectiveness of&#xD;
      SCH 72105 will also be studied by measuring the interferon (IFN) levels in the urine.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The Study Drug:&#xD;
&#xD;
      SCH 72105 is designed to cause &quot;gene transfer&quot; by giving a gene called interferon -alpha-2b&#xD;
      into the body. SCH 72105 is made after being processed in the lab with a study drug called&#xD;
      Syn3. This combination of study drugs is also called SCH 721015 with Syn3. Syn3 is designed&#xD;
      to help the body make a protein called interferon -alpha-2b, and this may help the body's&#xD;
      immune system to react against the cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Drug Administration:&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Days 1 and 4, SCH 72105 will be given into your bladder over about 1 minute through a&#xD;
      urinary catheter. A urinary catheter is a thin flexible tube placed through the urinary tube&#xD;
      and into the bladder. SCH 72105 will stay in the bladder for about 1 hour. You will be asked&#xD;
      to turn from left to right, back to stomach, every 15 minutes to allow the bladder surface to&#xD;
      be exposed to the drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A belladonna and opium (B&amp;O) suppository will be inserted into your rectum about 30 minutes&#xD;
      before the study drug doses. Levsin SL (hyoscyamine sulfate) will be given by mouth about 15&#xD;
      minutes before the study drug doses. These drugs are used to lower the risk of urinary&#xD;
      urgency (a strong need to urinate).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Visits:&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Day 1:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 3 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Urine will be collected to test for IFN levels and to check for infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Your vital signs will be measured before and after the study drug dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will be asked about any side effects and urinary symptoms you may have had and any&#xD;
           drugs you may be taking.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Your performance status will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Days 2 and 3 and on Days 5-14:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Urine will be collected for biomarker testing. Biomarkers in your urine may be related&#xD;
           to your reaction to the study drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Your performance status will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will be asked about any side effects and urinary symptoms you may have had and any&#xD;
           drugs you may be taking.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Day 4:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 3 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Urine will be collected for biomarker testing and to check for infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Your vital signs will be measured before and after the study drug dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will be asked about any side effects and urinary symptoms you may have had and any&#xD;
           drugs you may be taking.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Your performance status will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During Days 1-11, you will add about 1/2 cup of bleach to the toilet bowl before every time&#xD;
      you urinate. You will then wait 15 minutes before flushing. You should avoid public bathrooms&#xD;
      on these days. This procedure is required to avoid exposing other people to the study drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One (1) time a week during Weeks 2-11, the study staff will call and ask you about any side&#xD;
      effects and urinary symptoms you may have had and any drugs you may be taking. During these&#xD;
      calls, your performance status will also be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At Week 12:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a physical exam.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 3 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Urine will be collected for biomarker testing and to check for infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Your vital signs will be measured.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have an ECG. This ECG will be used as a screening test to help the doctor&#xD;
           decide if you are eligible to take part in Part 2 of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Your performance status will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will be asked about any side effects and urinary symptoms you may have had and any&#xD;
           drugs you may be taking.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a cystoscopy with biopsies to check the status of the disease. All areas&#xD;
           that the doctor thinks might have a tumor will be biopsied. Your bladder will also be&#xD;
           measured during this procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Length of Participation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      You may receive the 2 doses of the study drug as planned, if the doctor thinks it is in your&#xD;
      best interest. You will not be able to receive the second dose of the study drug if the&#xD;
      disease gets worse or intolerable side effects occur.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 2 of the Study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the disease has completely responded by Week 12 (no sign of cancer), you will be asked to&#xD;
      take part in Part 2 of this study. In Part 2, participants will receive another 2 doses of&#xD;
      the study drug. There is a separate informed consent form that describes Part 2, including&#xD;
      screening tests that will help the doctor decide if you are eligible. You will be asked to&#xD;
      sign the informed consent form if you agree to take part.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The level of effectiveness of SCH72105 treatment will be studied by measurement of IFN levels&#xD;
      in the daily urine collections.&#xD;
&#xD;
      End-of-Study Visit:&#xD;
&#xD;
      You may choose to stop your study participation at any time. If you choose to stop before the&#xD;
      Week 12 visit, you will be asked to return for an end-of-study visit. You will also be called&#xD;
      by the study staff to ask about your health 1 time a year for the next 2 years. The following&#xD;
      tests and procedures will be performed at the end-of-study visit:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a physical exam.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have an ECG.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Urine will be collected for routine tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-Up:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you had any signs of bladder cancer at Week 12, the study staff will call you at Months 6,&#xD;
      9, 12, 24, and 36. You will be asked if you have had any serious side effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an investigational study. SCH 72105 is not FDA approved or commercially available. It&#xD;
      is currently being used for research purposes only.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 9 patients will take part in this study (9 total, for Parts 1 and 2). All will be&#xD;
      enrolled at MD Anderson.&#xD;
