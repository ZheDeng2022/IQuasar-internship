  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In 1995 we conducted a cross-sectional study to identify the effects of traditional and&#xD;
      western environments on prevalence of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and obesity in Pima&#xD;
      Indians in Mexico and the United States. The Mexican Pimas live in a remote mountainous&#xD;
      region and at that time had experienced little change from their traditional lifestyle.&#xD;
      Nothing was known about their T2DM prevalence. A similar number of non-Pima Mexicans live in&#xD;
      the same village. In contrast to the Mexican Pimas, the U.S. Pimas live in more westernized&#xD;
      society and have a high prevalence of diabetes. We found that although T2DM and obesity were&#xD;
      more prevalent in Mexican Pimas than non-Pimas, both Mexican groups had a significantly lower&#xD;
      prevalence of these disorders than U.S. Pimas. The lifestyle of the Mexican population&#xD;
      studied included a dramatically higher level of physical activity and a diet higher in fiber&#xD;
      and lower in calories derived from fat compared with the U.S. Pimas. Since the U.S. and&#xD;
      Mexican Pimas share a similar gene pool we concluded that even in populations genetically&#xD;
      prone to T2DM and obesity, their development is determined largely by environmental&#xD;
      circumstances.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since 1995 the environmental circumstances of the Mexican Pimas and non-Pimas have changed.&#xD;
      The electrical supply to the region has increased, cars have become more prevalent and&#xD;
      grocery stores have appeared. The impact of these changes on T2DM and obesity has not been&#xD;
      examined. In light of these events, we propose to: 1) compare the current prevalence of T2DM&#xD;
      and obesity in Mexican Pimas and non-Pima Mexicans to that present in 1995 with the same&#xD;
      measures used previously, including height, weight, waist circumference, body composition by&#xD;
      bioelectrical impedance, oral glucose tolerance and HbA1c; 2) compare current diet, physical&#xD;
      activity and total energy expenditure in both Mexican Pimas and. non-Pima Mexicans using the&#xD;
      same methods as the 1995 study to the previous results and 3) document the frequencies of&#xD;
      T2DM and obesity-associated genetic variants in Mexican Pimas compared with U.S. Pimas and&#xD;
      non-Pima Mexicans.&#xD;

        Selection of Subjects:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -The entire adult population of Maycoba, Sonora, Mexico, will be invited to participate in&#xD;
        the main study. Individuals will be eligible to participate if they are at least 18 years&#xD;
        old and residents of Maycoba and able to give informed consent. There will be no further&#xD;
        exclusion or inclusion criteria. For the doubly-labeled water studies pregnant women will&#xD;
        be excluded, since pregnancy has profound effects on energy expenditure.&#xD;
