      The investigators suspect that using ultrasound to guide insertion of needles for dialysis&#xD;
      patients will make this process quicker and more accurate, thus reducing complications and&#xD;
      reducing discomfort for patients.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Haemodialysis patients need to have two needles inserted into a large surgically altered vein&#xD;
      (fistula) or surgical vascular graft/shunt for every dialysis session. Some fistulas or&#xD;
      shunts may be more difficult to insert needles into than others. As such a system of colour&#xD;
      coding or &quot;traffic lighting&quot; of patients is in place in most units. A &quot;green light&quot; patient&#xD;
      is easy to &quot;needle&quot; with two needles and the majority of staff within the unit will be able&#xD;
      to connect the patients to the dialysis machine. A &quot;red light&quot; patient is reserved for the&#xD;
      more experienced staff within the unit who will often have to be timetabled to work specific&#xD;
      times so that they are present to connect certain patients to the dialysis machines. &quot;Amber&#xD;
      light&quot; fistulas lie between these two extremes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ultrasound (US) is routinely used in many hospitals and many dialysis units will have access&#xD;
      to a machine to assess patients for problems. Indeed central venous line insertions for&#xD;
      dialysis are now almost always performed under US guidance since two large studies in this&#xD;
      area in 2002 provided strong evidence that US guided placement significantly reduces&#xD;
      complications during catheter placement and a reduction in the number of attempts at&#xD;
      insertion. In addition the National Institute of Clinical Excellence in the UK provided&#xD;
      evidence that insertion time is quicker although this association was statistically less&#xD;
      convincing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ultrasound offers the advantage of dynamic imaging without the risks of radiation exposure&#xD;
      and can be done as an office based procedure using portable equipment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Studies in emergency departments and particularly in paediatric care have suggested that US&#xD;
      guidance can improve the speed and accuracy of cannulation in peripheral veins for&#xD;
      intravenous access.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We suggest that US guided cannulation of fistulas might improve the cannulation rate of more&#xD;
      difficult fistulas and potentially reduce the time required to commence dialysis and the&#xD;
      number of local complications of cannulation (haematoma/aneurysm/infection).&#xD;
&#xD;
      To our knowledge US is not used in cannulation guidance in any dialysis units, although most&#xD;
      units will have access to a machine as above. We therefore propose to perform a randomised&#xD;
      controlled trial of US guided cannulation of fistulas versus current practice (blind&#xD;
      cannulation) to assess the effectiveness of US controlled cannulation in a busy dialysis&#xD;
      unit.&#xD;
