      The primary objective of the investigators study is to determine if there is a difference in&#xD;
      continuation rates at six months in women who are randomized to have the Levonorgestrel&#xD;
      Intrauterine System (LNG-IUS) inserted at two possible time periods: Immediate (defined as&#xD;
      after delivery of placenta to 72 hours postpartum) or Interval (defined as after 6 weeks&#xD;
      postpartum).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The control arm of our study will be women who are randomized to receive LNG-IUS in the&#xD;
      Interval time period. The study arm will consist of women randomized to receiving Immediate&#xD;
      placement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that Immediate placement of IUD in the postpartum period will&#xD;
      result in a 20% decrease in continuation rates at six months compared to Interval placement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcome measures that we will obtain include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pain at the time of placement&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Postpartum Depression&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Breastfeeding status&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Postpartum weight retention&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Expulsion Rates&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Bleeding Profile&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Uterine Infection(Endometritis)&#xD;

    <description>Primary objective: Determine if there is a difference in continuation rates at six months postpartum in women who have the Levonorgestrel Intrauterine System (LNG-IUS) inserted at two time periods: Immediate (after delivery of placenta to 72 hours postpartum) or Interval (after 6 weeks postpartum).&#xD;
Our analysis will be conducted on all randomized women on an intention to treat basis. Once insertion has occurred, evaluation at 6 months postpartum with the presence or absence of the LNG-IUS in the uterus will be determined to calculate the continuation rate.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Pain at insertion</measure>
    <time_frame>1 minute</time_frame>
    <description>Pain will be measured using the validated Visual Analog Scale (VAS) at the time of insertion.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Postpartum Depression</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Depression history will be determined from the initial data collection sheet upon entry into the study. The Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale will be filled out by the participant at their six week postpartum appointment (routine), and also at six months.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Breastfeeding Status</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>We will identify those who plan on breastfeeding their infants prior to discharge from the hospital. We will also determine the number of hours to Lactogenesis II (avg 40-50 hrs) via phone interview within one week from discharge. We will determine discontinuation rates and days to discontinuation of breastfeeding at six weeks and six months. We will also record infant weights at the postpartum appointment and at six months.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Postpartum weight retention</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>We will determine each participant's pre pregnancy BMI, BMI at admission to labor and delivery, and BMI at the postpartum appointment and at 6 months.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Sexual Function</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>We will determine the number of days from delivery to resumption of sexual intercourse. We will also have the participant complete the Female Sexual Function Index questionnaire (FSFI) at the postpartum appointment and at 6 months.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Expulsion Rate</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Expulsion rate as well as resumption of contraception (whether LNG-IUS is replaced or another form of contraception is initiated) occurs at the postpartum appointment and at six months</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Bleeding Profile</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Each Participant will be asked to complete a monthly menstrual flow calendar to document light, medium, or heavy bleeding. These will be collected at the postpartum appointment and at six months.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Infectious morbidity</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Postpartum endometritis and pelvic inflammatory disease will be tracked with record review and direct participant questioning at their postpartum appointment and at six months</description>
