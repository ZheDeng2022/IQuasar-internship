  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a highly prevalent condition in veterans with some estimates&#xD;
      as high as 47%. Poor adherence to the primary treatment of OSA -- continuous positive airway&#xD;
      pressure (CPAP) therapy - is associated with increased risk for heart attacks, strokes and&#xD;
      even death. The investigators plan to improve CPAP adherence in veterans through their&#xD;
      interactions with peers who have successfully adopted CPAP therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Such &quot;peer-buddies&quot; may promote the well-being of veterans while remaining highly&#xD;
      cost-effective when compared to healthcare providers. Our strategy is grounded on the&#xD;
      rationale that veterans as a group are ecoculturally more homogenous than expected for the&#xD;
      given level of differences in age, gender, ethnicity, or socioeconomic strata. Our long-term&#xD;
      objectives are to initiate a larger, multi-site, research study for enhancing CPAP adherence&#xD;
      in veterans with OSA. The ultimate goal of this research is to develop a cheap, effective and&#xD;
      exportable system of care to promote CPAP adherence in patients with OSA.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Project background: Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a prevalent condition that is most&#xD;
      frequently treated with continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) therapy. Non-adherence to&#xD;
      such therapy, however, afflicts a high proportion of adults with sleep apnea (46-83%).&#xD;
      Moreover, such non-adherence to CPAP is associated with increased risk for fatal and&#xD;
      non-fatal cardiovascular events. There remains a paucity of reliable and cost-effective&#xD;
      interventions that could promote CPAP adherence. Promoting adherence to therapy through&#xD;
      peer-driven intervention is cheap and has met with modest success in other chronic conditions&#xD;
      such as HIV, heart failure and diabetes mellitus. Whether such a peer-driven (&quot;buddy&quot;) system&#xD;
      can improve adherence to CPAP therapy is unknown.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Project Objectives: Our overall aim is to assess the feasibility and acceptability of a CPAP&#xD;
      adherence program driven by trained &quot;peer-buddies&quot; with sleep apnea. Specific Objective #1:&#xD;
      To evaluate patient ratings of the acceptability of the peer buddy system (PBS) in veterans&#xD;
      receiving CPAP therapy for OSA. Specific Objective #2: To obtain preliminary data on the&#xD;
      effectiveness of PBS on sleep-specific HR-QOL (Functional outcomes in sleep questionnaire&#xD;
      [FOSQ]) in veterans receiving CPAP therapy for OSA. Specific Objective #3: To obtain&#xD;
      preliminary data on the effect of PBS on CPAP adherence, vigilance, patient activation, and&#xD;
      self-efficacy in veterans receiving CPAP therapy for OSA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Project Methods: In order to address these aims, we will recruit recently diagnosed patients&#xD;
      with OSA who have not been initiated on CPAP therapy and randomly assign them to the&#xD;
      peer-buddy system to promote adherence to CPAP therapy (intervention group) or be assigned to&#xD;
      usual care (control group). In the PBS intervention group, trained peers with sleep apnea&#xD;
      will be paired with the newly diagnosed patients over a 3- month period. During this time the&#xD;
      trained peers will share experiences on coping strategies with CPAP device and equipment&#xD;
      (promote self efficacy), share their positive experiences (motivational effects and outcome&#xD;
      expectancies), share their knowledge of perceived vulnerabilities due to untreated sleep&#xD;
      apnea (promote risk perception), share methods for improving efficacy of CPAP equipment and&#xD;
      interface (patient education) and prepare their subjects for upcoming physician or&#xD;
      respiratory therapist appointments (patient activation). The interaction will occur during&#xD;
      supervised &quot;in-person&quot; sessions and during telephonic conversations over the 3-month period.&#xD;
      Subjects from both groups will be reassessed at the end of 3 months in order to determine&#xD;
      objective measures of CPAP adherence, sleep-specific HRQOL Functional outcomes of sleep&#xD;
      questionnaire [FOSQ]), vigilance (psychomotor vigilance testing), measures of self-efficacy&#xD;
      (outcome expectancy, treatment self-efficacy, and risk perception [SEMSA questionnaire]) and&#xD;
      patient activation (Patient Activation Measure [PAM]).&#xD;
