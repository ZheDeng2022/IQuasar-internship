      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Allergic inflammation is central to allergy-related diseases and disorders, such as asthma,&#xD;
      food allergies, and atopic dermatitis. Atopic dermatitis, commonly called eczema is a&#xD;
      chronic, noncontagious skin condition, usually starting in the first years of life, which&#xD;
      causes itching and scaling of an individual s skin. Because atopic dermatitis is a common&#xD;
      condition in children who have allergy-related diseases, including asthma, researchers are&#xD;
      interested in studying both individuals with atopic dermatitis and their close relatives&#xD;
      (parents and children) to better understand how allergy-related diseases develop and&#xD;
      progress. In addition, some patients with inherited disorders with features including atopic&#xD;
      dermatitis or other aspects of allergy such as food allergy, asthma, hay fever, hives, and&#xD;
      others, will also be seen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To study the natural history of diseases of allergic inflammation, such as atopic&#xD;
      dermatitis or genetic disorders associated with allergic inflammation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Children and adolescents between 1 month and 21 years of age who have a documented&#xD;
           history of moderate to severe atopic dermatitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Individuals between 1 month and 80 years of age who have a suspected genetic or&#xD;
           inherited allergy disorder related to atopic dermatitis or allergic pathways.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Child and adult relatives of eligible participants will also be studied on this&#xD;
           protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The study will require one initial visit to the National Institutes of Health Clinical&#xD;
           Center (lasting 1-5 days), as well as any required follow-up visits for treatment and&#xD;
           research studies. Participants will receive treatment for atopic dermatitis and other&#xD;
           allergic diseases as part of the study for up to 1 year.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will have some or all of the following tests as part of this study:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A detailed physical examination and medical history&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Allergy skin prick testing to examine participants' responses to different allergens.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood samples for additional allergen testing, testing the immune system, and other&#xD;
           research purposes&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Skin punch biopsy to take a skin sample&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Lung function tests to measure airflow from the lungs and inflammation&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Food-related tests to diagnose potential food allergies&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Leukapheresis to collect white blood cells only&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Research samples, including stool specimens, saliva samples, buccal swabs (to collect&#xD;
           cells from the inside of the cheek), and skin cell samples&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Clinical digital photography to provide images of affected and healthy skin.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be asked to return for follow-up visits and tests for up to 1 year&#xD;
           after the initial visit(s).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Allergic inflammation is central to the pathogenesis of allergic diseases, including atopic&#xD;
      dermatitis, asthma, allergic rhinitis, and food allergy. These disorders are common,&#xD;
      affecting up to 50 million Americans, and their pathophysiology remains poorly understood.&#xD;
      Among allergic diseases, atopic dermatitis is common, with a prevalence of up to 20% in&#xD;
      children. It is associated with the most dramatic elevations of IgE levels and most prominent&#xD;
      T-helper type 2 cell (Th2) inflammation, and treatment remains challenging. Atopic&#xD;
      dermatitis, eosinophilic inflammation, and systemic immediate hypersensitivity reactions are&#xD;
      heralding manifestation of allergic disease in many children, making these ideal disorders&#xD;
      for studying the effector mechanisms promoting the development and progression of allergic&#xD;
      diseases. In addition to these manifestations, there are also a number of characterized&#xD;
      genetic and congenital diseases, most presenting in childhood, that have prominent allergic&#xD;
      manifestations, including dermatitis, or affect atopic pathways. These disorders provide&#xD;
      further opportunity for advancing our understanding of the genetics and pathophysiology of&#xD;
      diseases of allergic inflammation. The NIAID Laboratory of Allergic Diseases (LAD) has a long&#xD;
      interest in exploring the mechanisms of allergic inflammation. Utilizing the resources of the&#xD;
      LAD and the NIH Clinical Center, we will advance our understanding of allergic inflammation&#xD;
      and the genetics and pathogenesis of allergic diseases through the study of these patients.&#xD;
      The findings of this protocol will have implications for improved diagnosis, treatment and&#xD;
      prevention of allergic diseases, including atopic asthma&#xD;
