    <textblock>
      A randomized two-way crossover study to determine whether concomitant administration of CYP&#xD;
      P450 3A4 inhibitor ketoconazole and fluticasone furoate/GW642444M combination significantly&#xD;
      increases the systemic effects and exposure to repeat dose fluticasone furoate and/or&#xD;
      GW642444 in healthy subjects. Key assessments will include blood potassium, heart rate, blood&#xD;
      pressure, QTc, serum cortisol and pharmacokinetic parameters, and safety including vital&#xD;
      signs, ECGs, adverse event monitoring and laboratory safety tests, including blood glucose.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This will be a single centre, randomized, double-blind (with respect to ketoconazole),&#xD;
      two-way cross-over study in healthy male and female subjects. Subjects will attend for a&#xD;
      screening visit within 28 days prior to the first treatment period. There will be two study&#xD;
      periods, each consisting of 14 days. Ketoconazole or matching placebo will be administered&#xD;
      for 11 days with fluticasone furoate/GW642444M inhalation powder co-administered on Days&#xD;
      5-11. During each period subjects will be required to report to the unit on Day -1 and will&#xD;
      remain there until 1 hour post-dosing with ketoconazole or placebo on Day 1. Subjects will&#xD;
      return to the unit on the mornings of Day 2 to Day 4 for dosing with ketoconazole or placebo.&#xD;
      Subjects will then return on the evening of Day 4 and leave the unit on the morning of Day 6&#xD;
      (2 nights). Subjects will return to the unit on the mornings of Day 7 to Day 10 for dosing&#xD;
      and pre-fluticasone furoate/GW642444M dose safety assessments. Subjects will return on the&#xD;
      evening of Day 10 and leave the unit on the morning of Day 12 (2 nights). Subjects will make&#xD;
      two outpatient visits, one in the evening on Day 12 and one in the morning on Day 13, to&#xD;
      complete a few study related procedures. The two treatment periods will be separated by a&#xD;
      washout of at least 7 days and no more than 14 days. Pharmacodynamic profiles for potassium,&#xD;
      heart rate, QTc, blood pressure and serum cortisol will be taken on Day 11 with fluticasone&#xD;
      furoate and GW642444 pharmacokinetic profiles on Days 5 and 11. Safety assessments will&#xD;
      include vital signs, ECGs, adverse event monitoring and laboratory safety tests, plus blood&#xD;
      glucose and blood potassium profiles on Day 5.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Healthy male or female between 18 and 64 years of age inclusive&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. A female subject is eligible to participate if she is of:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Non-childbearing potential defined as pre-menopausal females with a documented&#xD;
                  tubal ligation or hysterectomy; or postmenopausal defined as 12 months of&#xD;
                  spontaneous amenorrhea [in questionable cases a blood sample with simultaneous&#xD;
                  follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) &gt; 40 MlU/ml and estradiol &lt; 40 pg/ml (&lt;140&#xD;
                  pmol/L) is confirmatory]. Females on hormone replacement therapy (HRT) and whose&#xD;
                  menopausal status is in doubt will be required to use one of the contraception&#xD;
                  methods in Section 8.1 if they wish to continue their HRT during the study.&#xD;
                  Otherwise, they must discontinue HRT to allow confirmation of post-menopausal&#xD;
                  status prior to study enrollment. For most forms of HRT, at least 2-4 weeks will&#xD;
                  elapse between the cessation of therapy and the blood draw; this interval depends&#xD;
                  on the type and dosage of HRT. Following confirmation of their post-menopausal&#xD;
                  status, they can resume use of HRT during the study without use of a&#xD;
                  contraceptive method.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Child-bearing potential and agrees to use one of the contraception methods listed&#xD;
                  in Section 8.1 for an appropriate period of time (as determined by the product&#xD;
                  label or investigator) prior to the start of dosing to sufficiently minimize the&#xD;
                  risk of pregnancy at that point. Female subjects must agree to use contraception&#xD;
                  until completion of the follow-up visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Body mass index within range of 18.5-29.0 kg/m2 inclusive.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Subjects who are current non-smokers, who have not used any tobacco products in the 12&#xD;
             month period preceding the screening visit, and have a pack history of &lt;/= 5 pack&#xD;
             years.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. AST, ALT, alkaline phosphatase and bilirubin &lt;/= 1.5xULN (isolated bilirubin &gt;1.5xULN&#xD;
             is acceptable if bilirubin is fractionated and direct bilirubin &lt;35%).&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. No significant abnormality on 12-lead ECG at screening, including the following&#xD;
             specific requirements:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  QTcF &lt; 450 msec&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. No clinically significant abnormality on the Holter ECG at screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. FEV1 &gt;/= 85% predicted at screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Capable of giving written informed consent, which includes compliance with the&#xD;
             requirements and restrictions listed in the consent form.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Able to satisfactorily use the dry powder inhaler.&#xD;

        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. As a result of medical interview, physical examination or screening investigations,&#xD;
