  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a non-blinded, non-randomized pharmacokinetic study to determine the oral&#xD;
      bioavailability of clofarabine, and the effect of cimetidine on clofarabine pharmacokinetics&#xD;
      in patients with poor-risk acute leukemias and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Clofarabine is a second-generation adenosine nucleoside analog with activity in hematologic&#xD;
      malignancies. It has gained FDA-approval for use in children with relapsed-refractory ALL,&#xD;
      and early phase studies have shown activity in patients with AML and MDS. Clofarabine's&#xD;
      activity in acute leukemias and MDS has been established in multiple phase I and II studies,&#xD;
      both alone and in combination with cytosine arabinoside (araC), and in both&#xD;
      relapsed-refractory patients, and untreated older adults.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pharmacokinetic investigations comparing I.V. and P.O. dosing within the same patient have&#xD;
      not been performed. Furthermore, the effect of OCT2 inhibition on clofarabine&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics in humans has not been investigated. The potential for enhanced drug&#xD;
      exposure and toxicity in the setting of OCT2 inhibition is of clinical importance as&#xD;
      clofarabine gains broader indications in hematologic oncology. In particular, bioavailability&#xD;
      and the OCT2 mechanism are important with prolonged drug exposure and oral administration in&#xD;
      older adults, who are likely to have impaired renal function and take other drugs that&#xD;
      interact with OCT2 such as metformin (a substrate) and trimethoprim (one of several&#xD;
      inhibitors). OCT2 is expressed on several solid tumor cell lines, and is thought to play a&#xD;
      role in tumor uptake of cationic cytotoxins. Whether OCT2 or other transporters are expressed&#xD;
      on leukemic blasts, or influence drug uptake has not been investigated. However, variation in&#xD;
      the expression of drug transporters could be one of several mechanistic explanations for the&#xD;
      fact that clofarabine-responsive patients accumulate intracellular clofarabine triphosphate,&#xD;
      whereas non-responders do not.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Single nucleotide polymorphisms have been identified in the gene encoding OCT2, which may&#xD;
      influence substrate uptake or inhibitor potency. Such polymorphisms may explain variation in&#xD;
      clofarabine pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics between individuals, but the potential for&#xD;
      this phenomenon has not previously been investigated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will receive clofarabine as induction therapy in five doses. Initially, and unless&#xD;
      dose escalation or de-escalation criteria are met, patients will be assigned to dose level 0&#xD;
      (IV Clofarabine 15mg/m2; Oral clofarabine 30mg/m2). The first three doses (on days 1, 3 and&#xD;
      5) will be administered followed by washout periods that extend until the next clofarabine&#xD;
      dose is administered. During the washout periods, frequent phlebotomy for PK sampling will be&#xD;
      performed in an outpatient setting at the UNC Clinical Translational Research Center (CTRC).&#xD;
      The duration of the induction period will be determined by time to recovery of hematologic&#xD;
      toxicity (platelets &gt;50 x 109/liter, ANC &gt;1.0x109/liter).&#xD;
&#xD;
      AML patients achieving CR, and MDS patients achieving CR, PR or hematologic improvement will&#xD;
      receive additional consolidation cycles of oral clofarabine daily on days 1 through 5 of each&#xD;
      subsequent cycle, with clofarabine dose according to assigned dose level (0: 30 mg/m2, -1: 20&#xD;
      mg/m2, +1: 40 mg/m2). Consolidation cycles will begin no sooner than 28 days after the first&#xD;
      day of the previous clofarabine cycle. Patients will be evaluated for response after each&#xD;
      cycle, and will be continued on trial for up to 6 total cycles of therapy as long as a&#xD;
      response or lack of progression is maintained and no Grade 3-4 non-hematologic toxicities&#xD;
      have been observed in that patient.&#xD;
