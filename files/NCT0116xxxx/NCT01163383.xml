    <textblock>
      Metaiodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) is a substance that is taken up by neuroblastoma cells. MIBG&#xD;
      is combined with radioactive iodine (131 I) in the laboratory to form a radioactive compound&#xD;
      131 I-MIBG. This radioactive compound delivers radiation specifically to the cancer cells and&#xD;
      causes them to die.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this research protocol provides a mechanism to deliver MIBG therapy when&#xD;
      clinically indicated, but also to provide a mechanism to continue to collect efficacy and&#xD;
      toxicity data that will be provided.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A recent New Approaches to Neuroblastoma Therapy (NANT) phase 2 randomized trial of 131I-MIBG&#xD;
      with or without radiation sensitizers for relapsed refractory or persistent neuroblastoma&#xD;
      enrolled 114 patients ages 1-30 years showed that Arm A (MIBG alone) had a response rate of&#xD;
      17%, Arm B (MIBG with Vincristine and Irnotecan) had a response rate of 14% and Arm C (MIBG&#xD;
      with vorinostat) had a response rate of 32% after the first cycle. After the second cycle,&#xD;
      Arm A had a response rate of 33%, Arm B had 30% response rate and Arm C had a 75% response&#xD;
      rate. There was an excess of toxicities in Arm B, and no significant SAEs in Arm C. These&#xD;
      data were reported at the American Society of Clinical Oncology meeting in June of 2020.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Vorinostat has been used extensively in adults and has been granted US FDA approval for the&#xD;
      treatment of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma. The approved adult dose is 400 mg orally once daily.&#xD;
      Vorinostat is not FDA approved for use in neuroblastoma.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      131I-MIBG is experimental, but has been used in more than 100 children in the United States&#xD;
      by itself to treat relapsed neuroblastoma. A recent study using increasing doses of 131I-MIBG&#xD;
      in both children and adults with relapsed neuroblastoma or metastatic&#xD;
      pheochromocytoma/ganglioma showed anti-cancer effects in some of these patients. The main&#xD;
      side effect of this treatment was a decrease in the number of normal blood-forming cells&#xD;
      (called stem cells) in the bone marrow, but a dose of 12 mCi/kg did not cause permanent&#xD;
      damage to the bone marrow in a small number of patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are certain tests or procedures that will need to be done to confirm that the subject&#xD;
      is eligible for this therapy. These include lab work, physical exam and MIBG scan. A CT scan,&#xD;
      an MRI, a bone scan, bone marrow aspirate and biopsy and urine tests will be done to evaluate&#xD;
      your disease status when clinically indicated. Your doctor will determine which tests are&#xD;
      required.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will need to have an intravenous catheter (tube) placed in a vein before beginning&#xD;
      study treatment. An existing central venous catheter can be used to administer the medicine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Because subjects' urine will be radioactive, a urinary catheter may be inserted to ensure&#xD;
      drainage of the urine, which will be radioactive. The catheter will be removed 3-5 days&#xD;
      following the treatment. General anesthesia or sedation is typically given for the procedure&#xD;
      of inserting the catheter.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be treated in a specially prepared room in the CHOP Pediatric Oncology Unit.&#xD;
      Upon admission, the nursing staff will instruct caregivers on the care of the subject&#xD;
      following the MIBG infusion. Because of the frequent exposure of the nursing staff to&#xD;
      radiation and the high level of radiation surrounding the subject during therapy, the nurses'&#xD;
      contact will be limited to complex medical care, so that they are available for subjects in&#xD;
      the event of an emergency. Adult family members will be expected to be present at all times&#xD;
      during the hospitalization to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Assist with hygiene&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Give oral medications&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Offer and empty bedpans&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Assist with meals&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Change diapers (if used)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Change clothing and bed linens if soiled&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Entertain or distract individuals who become upset or restless due to the isolation or&#xD;
           procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Record Dosimeter readings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Isolation: For 2-5 days subjects will be placed in a single room with a bed surrounded by&#xD;
      lead shielding to prevent exposure of visitors and hospital personnel to radioactivity.&#xD;
      Family members may visit in the room, but must wear a radiation badge to measure exposure. A&#xD;
      single family member can sleep in the room, but no one is allowed to go behind the shields or&#xD;
      sleep in the bed with the child.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will receive fluids through the central venous catheter. The fluids will begin at&#xD;
      least four hours before and continue at least 72 hours after the 131I-MIBG treatment begins.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will take a medicine by mouth, potassium iodide, to prevent thyroid damage from the&#xD;
      radioactive iodine contained in the 131I-MIBG. This medication will be taken on the day of&#xD;
      the treatment and will continue for a total of 6 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The 131I-MIBG will be given through an intravenous catheter over 1-2 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the administration of the drug, subject's blood pressure and heart rate will be&#xD;
      checked frequently.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before and at regular intervals after treatment, subjects will have routine blood tests to&#xD;
      check his/her blood counts, hormone, liver and kidney functions. Blood will be checked&#xD;
      frequently for the first 1-6 weeks, and 6 weeks after the treatment. Approximately 1 teaspoon&#xD;
      of blood will be drawn each time during the first 6 weeks to perform the tests listed above.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An MIBG scan will be performed to see where the drug is concentrating in the body following&#xD;
      treatment. No injection of a radioactive marker will be required and this is usually done on&#xD;
      the day for discharge. It is identical to the pretherapy MIBG scan except for not needing&#xD;
      MIBG injection and it is usually shorter (15-30 minutes).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Six to eight weeks after treatment, an MIBG and other scans will be done to evaluate the&#xD;
      response of the tumor to the treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the subject's tumor is responding or stable 6-7 weeks after each treatment, they may be&#xD;
      eligible for a second and third course of treatment, as long as their white blood counts have&#xD;
      recovered from the treatment and the patient has stem cells available if needed. If another&#xD;
      MIBG treatment is given, it will be at the same dose as the first treatment, unless it is&#xD;
      thought to be necessary for safety reasons (based on toxicity information from the first&#xD;
      infusion) to decrease the dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the subject's blood counts decrease following the therapy, treatment with Filgrastim&#xD;
      (G-CSF) or Neulasta may be required. G-CSF/neulasta is a medicine that helps increase the&#xD;
      white blood cells. This is given by a subcutaneous (under the skin) injection (like an&#xD;
      insulin shot). GCSF is given daily and Neulasta is given every 14 days instead of GCSF.&#xD;
      Neulasta works like GCSF to help increase the white blood counts but lasts longer in your&#xD;
      child's body. This medicine will start if the absolute neutrophil count (ANC), a measure of&#xD;
      the infection fighting cells, goes below 500 and will continue until recovery, generally&#xD;
      above 5000.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Vorinostat may be given at the discretion of the PI and treating physician as a clinical&#xD;
      procedure. This will be administered for clinical purposes, regardless of study&#xD;
      participation. Patients will receive 180 mg/m2/dose (maximum dose 400 mg) as in the recently&#xD;
      completed NANT study once daily by mouth, NG, or G-tube on days -1 to +12 (14 total doses).&#xD;
      Vorinostat will be given for 14 days continuously. Vorinostat should be taken with food or&#xD;
      within 30 minutes after a meal. The dose should be taken in the morning whenever possible. On&#xD;
      day 1 of therapy, vorinostat should be taken 1 hour prior to the start of the 131I-MIBG&#xD;
      infusion.&#xD;

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Refractory or relapsed neuroblastoma&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age greater than 1 year and able to cooperate with radiation safety restrictions&#xD;
             during therapy period.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Performance Level: Patients must have a Karnofsky or Lansky performance status of&#xD;
             equal to or greater than 50 percent&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Disease status: Failure to respond to standard therapy (usually combination&#xD;
             chemotherapy with or without radiation and surgery) or development of progressive&#xD;
             disease at any time. Disease evaluable by MIBG scan must be present within 8 weeks of&#xD;
             study entry and subsequent to any intervening therapy. The principal or&#xD;
             co-investigator can waive the requirement for intervening therapy if in their judgment&#xD;
             this would pose undue risk and would not affect ability to judge treatment&#xD;
             effectiveness.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Stem cells: Patients must have a hematopoietic stem cell product available for&#xD;
             re-infusion after MIBG treatment at doses of at least 12 mCi/kg. The recommended&#xD;
             minimum quantity for peripheral blood stem cells is 1.0 x 10^6 CD34+ cells/kg. The&#xD;
             minimum dose for bone marrow is 1.0 x 10^8 mononuclear cells/kg. If no stem cells are&#xD;
             available, the dose of 131 I-MIBG should be 12mCi/kg or less.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prior Therapy: Patients may enter this study with or without re-induction therapy for&#xD;
             recurrent tumor. Patients must have fully recovered from the toxic effects of any&#xD;
             prior therapy. Subjects cannot be receiving chemotherapy, cytokine therapy or other&#xD;
             investigational agents, and must have fully recovered from the toxic effects of any&#xD;
             prior therapy. No investigational agents are allowed in this time frame, but&#xD;
             FDA-approved drugs for other indications that are not cytotoxic are allowed to be used&#xD;
             off label if this is considered in the best interest of the patient by the&#xD;
             investigator. No concomitant cytotoxic therapy is permitted with the exception of&#xD;
             vorinostat.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Liver function: Bilirubin ≤2x upper limit of normal; AST/ALT ≤10x upper limit of&#xD;
             normal&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Kidney function: Creatinine ≤3x upper limit of normal&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Signed informed consent: The patient and/or the patient's legally authorized guardian&#xD;
             must provide written informed consent to participate in this expanded access protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with disease of any major organ system that would compromise their ability to&#xD;
             withstand therapy, as deemed by the principal investigator or treating&#xD;
             sub-investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Because of the teratogenic potential of the study medications, no patients who are&#xD;
             pregnant or lactating will be allowed. Patients of childbearing potential must&#xD;
             practice an effective method of birth control while participating on this study, to&#xD;
             avoid possible damage to the fetus.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who are on hemodialysis&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with uncontrolled infections&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Exceptions to the above eligibility criteria may be allowed if approved by the&#xD;
             principal investigator as long as exception does not compromise the safety of the&#xD;
             subject and the exception is clearly documented. Each protocol exception must be&#xD;
             reviewed by the Institutional Review Board before therapy is initiated.&#xD;
