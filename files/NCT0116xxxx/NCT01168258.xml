      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Diabetic macular edema (DME) is a common condition in people with diabetes. DME occurs when&#xD;
      blood vessels in the eye leak fluid, resulting in swelling inside the back of the eye and&#xD;
      progressive vision loss. Research has shown that good blood sugar control can reduce the risk&#xD;
      and severity of DME. However, not all diabetic patients with poor blood sugar control develop&#xD;
      DME, and some patients develop DME despite excellent blood sugar control. This suggests that&#xD;
      other factors, such as genes or inherited traits, may predispose or protect a diabetic&#xD;
      patient from developing DME.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To investigate genetic factors that may influence the development of diabetic macular&#xD;
      edema.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Individuals at least 18 years of age who have type 2 diabetes, with or without diabetic&#xD;
      macular edema.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The study will require one visit to the National Institutes of Health eye clinic.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be screened with a medical history and basic eye examination.&#xD;
           Individuals who have certain eye diseases other than DME may not be allowed to enroll in&#xD;
           the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will provide a blood sample, and will receive fluorescein angiography (an&#xD;
           injection of fluorescein dye, after which a camera will take pictures of the dye as it&#xD;
           flows through the blood vessels in the eye).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  No treatment will be provided as part of this protocol.&#xD;

      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this study is to test the hypothesis that genetic polymorphisms of vascular&#xD;
      endothelial growth factor (VEGF), erythropoietin (EPO), endothelin-1 (EDN1) and receptor for&#xD;
      advanced glycation end product (RAGE) genes are associated with the development of diabetic&#xD;
      macular edema (DME).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two hundred case participants with DME and 200 diabetic controls without DME will be&#xD;
      enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a longitudinal, genetic association study evaluating whether single nucleotide&#xD;
      polymorphisms (SNPs) in VEGF, EPO, EDN1 and RAGE genes affect the development and progression&#xD;
      of DME. All participants will provide a blood sample, undergo an eye examination, optical&#xD;
      coherence tomography (OCT) and fluorescein angiography (FA) and discuss their medical, family&#xD;
      and social history. Case participants with DME and diabetic control participants without DME&#xD;
      will be allowed to receive standard-of-care treatment at the NEI under this protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome Measures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome variable is the genotype frequency of SNPs in the above specific genes of&#xD;
      DME and control participants. Secondary outcomes are serum levels of VEGF, EPO, EDN1 and AGE,&#xD;
      plasma biomarkers such as mRNA and ophthalmic measurements (visual acuity and imaging results&#xD;
      such as FA and OCT results). The longitudinal outcome measure includes investigating&#xD;
      associations between the studied genetic polymorphisms and the long-term response to&#xD;
      standard-of-care therapy.&#xD;

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        All participants must meet the following criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Participant is diagnosed with type 2 diabetes prior to enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Participant must understand and sign this protocol s informed consent document and agree to&#xD;
        provide a blood sample for analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Participant must be 18 years of age or older.&lt;TAB&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
        DME Participants (cases):&#xD;
&#xD;
        Participant is diagnosed with active DME defined by fluorescein leakage associated with&#xD;
        either central retinal thickness greater than 260 microns on spectral domain OCT or cystic&#xD;
        changes present on OCT.&#xD;
&#xD;
        OR&#xD;
&#xD;
        Participant has evidence of focal laser scars indicative of prior DME Investigators will&#xD;
        verify the laser therapy was performed for DME via medical records, fluorescein angiograms&#xD;
        or photographs.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Non-DME Participants (controls)&#xD;
&#xD;
        Participant has no evidence of DME defined fluorescein leakage associated with either&#xD;
        central retinal thickness greater than 260 microns on spectral domain OCT or cystic changes&#xD;
        present on OCT.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Participant has no evidence of focal laser scars indicative of prior DME.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Participant has another retinal disease that may confound the evaluation of the DME.&#xD;
        Examples include vein occlusions, uveitic macular edema or neovascular age-related macular&#xD;
        degeneration.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Participant has opacities of the ocular media, limitations of pupillary dilation or other&#xD;
        problems sufficient to preclude adequate dilated examination.&#xD;
