  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Melasma Area and Severity Index (MASI)</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 0, Week 4, Week 8, Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The following equation is used to determine the MASI score: MASI = .3A(D+H) [forhead] + .3A(D+H)[right malar] + .3A(D+H)[left malar] + .1A(D+H)[chin]; A = area, D = darkness, and H = homogeneity. Area is based on percentage of the region covered by melasma using a 1-6 scale. Darkness is determined on a 0-3 scale. Homogeneity is based on a 0-4 scale.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Patient Assessment</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 4, Week 8, Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>Subject critiqued their melasma as either getting worse, showing no improvement, mild improvement or as showing marked improvement upon using the treatment.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Evaluation of Photographs</measure>
    <time_frame>Post-Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>Photos were evaluated using the grading of worse, no improvement, mild improvement or marked improvement comparing week 12 to baseline.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Adverse Events</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 4, Week 8, Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>Recorded any and all adverse events that occurred even if it was unlikely that it was associated with the study product.</description>
