      To investigate the effect of the interleukin-1 (IL-1) blocking agent, anakinra, in patients&#xD;
      with treatment-resistant inflammatory myopathies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients and methods: Fifteen patients with refractory polymyositis (PM), dermatomyositis&#xD;
      (DM), or inclusion body myositis (IBM) were treated with 100 mg anakinra subcutaneously per&#xD;
      day during 12 months. Outcome measures included myositis disease activity score with&#xD;
      improvement defined according to The International Myositis Assessment and Clinical Studies&#xD;
      Group (IMACS) and for muscle performance the functional index of myositis (FI). In addition&#xD;
      repeat muscle biopsies were performed&#xD;

        predicted values as measured by functional index (FI) [45-47] and failure to respond to&#xD;
        treatment with high-dose glucocorticoids (0.75 mg/kg/day for at least one month) in&#xD;
        combination with azathioprine and/or methotrexate for at least two months.&#xD;

        mycobacterium, active pneumocystis carinii, active cytomegalovirus infection; documented&#xD;
        HIV infection; alcoholism, alcoholic liver disease or other chronic liver disease; chest&#xD;
        x-ray suggestive of active tuberculosis; and pregnant, nursing mothers or patients with&#xD;
