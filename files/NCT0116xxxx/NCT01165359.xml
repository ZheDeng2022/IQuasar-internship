  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hepatitis C (HCV) is a disease that affects the liver. ITX 5061 is a new medication that is&#xD;
      being tested to treat HCV. This study will evaluate the safety of ITX 5061 and examine&#xD;
      different doses of the medication to evaluate which dose is the most effective at lowering&#xD;
      the amount of HCV in the blood.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      HCV is a serious health concern and can lead to cirrhosis, liver cancer, and liver failure.&#xD;
      Currently, HCV is treated with pegylated interferon and ribavirin, but these medications are&#xD;
      not always effective and may have harmful side effects. ITX 5061 is a new medication that has&#xD;
      been developed to treat HCV. This study will take place in three parts-Parts A, B, and C.&#xD;
      Each part of the study will enroll participants for a different period of time, and within&#xD;
      each part of the study, participants will receive varying amounts of ITX 5061. If ITX 5061 is&#xD;
      found to be unsafe in any part of the study, the subsequent parts of the study will not&#xD;
      occur. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety of different doses of ITX 5061 and&#xD;
      determine the amount of time that is needed for ITX 5061 to safely lower the amount of HCV in&#xD;
      the blood.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will enroll people with HCV who are HIV-uninfected. Participants will enroll in&#xD;
      one of three parts of the study. They will be randomly assigned to receive ITX 5061 or&#xD;
      placebo once a day for 3 days in Part A, for 14 days in Part B, or for 28 days in Part C.&#xD;
      Within Parts A, B, and C, participants will receive either 150 mg, 75, mg, or 25 mg of ITX&#xD;
      5061. At a baseline study visit, participants will have a physical exam and blood and urine&#xD;
      collection. All participants will receive their assigned medication at this visit.&#xD;
      Participants in Part A will return for study visits on the 2 days after the baseline visit.&#xD;
      During these study visits, participants will undergo a physical exam and will have blood&#xD;
      collected several times over an 8-hour period. Participants in Part B of the study will&#xD;
      attend study visits 1, 2, 3, 7, 10, and 13 days after the baseline visit. Participants in&#xD;
      Part C of the study will attend study visits 1, 2, 3, 7, 10, 14, 21, and 27 days after the&#xD;
      baseline visit. Participants in Parts B and C will undergo similar study procedures as&#xD;
      participants in Part A. Throughout the study, participants will record their medication usage&#xD;
      in a diary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will attend a study visit the day after they receive their last medication&#xD;
      dose. In addition, participants in Part A will attend study visits 9 and 16 days after the&#xD;
      baseline visit, participants in Part B will attend study visits 20 and 27 days after the&#xD;
      baseline visit, and participants in Part C will attend study visits 34 and 41 days after the&#xD;
      baseline visit. At each of these follow-up visits, participants will have a physical exam and&#xD;
      a blood and urine collection.&#xD;
