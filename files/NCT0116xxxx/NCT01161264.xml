  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Influenza poses a significant threat to individual and public health, and influenza&#xD;
      vaccination with a trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine is widely recommended to children,&#xD;
      adults at risks and elderly. Due to antigenic changes of influenza viruses, the virus strains&#xD;
      used in interpandemic influenza vaccines are adjusted every year according to WHO (World&#xD;
      Health Organization) and CHMP (Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use)&#xD;
      recommendations. Following a change in the vaccine antigen composition recommendation from&#xD;
      the previous season, immunogenicity and tolerability of the newly composed vaccines are&#xD;
      subject of evaluation in an annual clinical trial in non-elderly adult and elderly subjects&#xD;
      according to the guidelines set by EMEA (CPMP/BWP/214/96).&#xD;
