      The objective of this study is to assist in the development of a noninvasive device for the&#xD;
      accurate measurement of blood glucose levels.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The feasibility of measuring blood glucose concentration in patients with diabetes mellitus&#xD;
      using near infrared (NIR) spectroscopy and multivariate data analysis techniques has been&#xD;
      established using general purpose, scientific-grade infrared spectrophotometers under the&#xD;
      90-049 UNM HRRC protocol. Now that the concept of painless, bloodless, and reagent-less&#xD;
      clinical laboratory tests has been shown to be viable, the challenge is to bring this&#xD;
      technology to the patients who need it. We must develop a device that is portable,&#xD;
      affordable, and rugged - all while improving accuracy. We must also improve our understanding&#xD;
      of the nature of glucose in whole, intact skin. Since the light beam cannot discriminate&#xD;
      plasma glucose in skin blood vessels from glucose in the larger skin interstitial fluid&#xD;
      space, the exact nature of the glucose in all tissue compartments contributing to the&#xD;
      light-beam signal must be elucidated. The noninvasive measurement can be no more accurate&#xD;
      than the reference measurement on which it was based. Finally, we have found that the&#xD;
      accuracy of the noninvasive measurement also worsens as a function of time from the initial&#xD;
      measurement. This effect is independent of instrumentation drift and is due to physical&#xD;
      changes in the patient's skin such as variation of hydration, collagen, vascularity,&#xD;
      glycation end-products, etc. To account for these sources of physiologic interference they&#xD;
      must be evaluated independently and then compared to errors of the noninvasive predictions&#xD;
      over time.&#xD;
