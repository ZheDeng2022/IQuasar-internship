           Ifosfamide + Mesna, Carboplatin and Etoposide (ICE) combination&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Randomized Phase-II: To estimate the complete response (CR) rate in patients with&#xD;

      Phase I:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Study Drugs:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Panobinostat is designed to block the function of enzymes that are found inside cancer cells.&#xD;
      These enzymes trigger cells to grow and multiply out of control. By blocking these enzymes,&#xD;
      it may slow down the growth of or kill cancer cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ifosfamide is designed to slow or stop the growth of cancer cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Carboplatin is designed to interfere with the growth of cancer cells by stopping cell&#xD;
      division, which may cause the cells to die.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Etoposide is designed to block cell growth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline Tests:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, the following tests and&#xD;
      procedures will be performed about 7 days before the first dose of the study drug:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a physical exam, including measurement of your height, weight, and vital&#xD;
           signs (blood pressure and heart rate).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have 1 electrocardiogram (ECG -- a test that measures the electrical activity&#xD;
           of the heart).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 2 1/2 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Women who are able to become pregnant must have a negative blood (about 1 1/2 teaspoons)&#xD;
           pregnancy test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will be assigned to a dose level of panobinostat based on when you join this study. Up to&#xD;
      2 dose levels of panobinostat will be tested. Up to 6participants will be enrolled at each&#xD;
      dose level. The first group of participants will receive the lowest dose level. Each new&#xD;
      group will receive a higher dose than the group before it, if no intolerable side effects&#xD;
      were seen. This will continue until the highest tolerable dose of panobinostat is found.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will receive the same dose level of ICE.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once the highest tolerable dose is found, up to 20 extra participants, called the expansion&#xD;
      group, will receive the study drugs at that dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Drug Administration:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each cycle is 14 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ICE Administration:&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Day 1 (+/- 2 days) of Cycles 1-3, you will receive ifosfamide by vein over 24 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Day 1 (+/- 2 days) of Cycles 1-3, you will receive carboplatin by vein over 1 hour.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Days 1-3 (+/- 2 days) of Cycles 1-3, you will receive etoposide by vein over 2 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will also receive mesna to help prevent side effects. On Day 2 (+/- 2 days) of Cycles&#xD;
      1-3, you will receive mesna by vein over 12 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will also receive pegfilgrastim to help prevent side effects. Beginning 24-48 hours after&#xD;
      the completion of chemotherapy of Cycles 1-3, you will take pegfilgrastim through a needle&#xD;
      under the skin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Panobinostat Administration:&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will take panobinostat by mouth starting Day -6 of Cycle 1 (6 days before your first dose&#xD;
      of ICE). You will take the panobinostat on Days -6, -4, and -2 of Cycle 1 and Days 1, 3, 5,&#xD;
      8, 10, and 12 of Cycles 1 and 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are in the expansion group, you will take panobinostat by mouth starting Day -6 of&#xD;
      Cycle 1 (6 days before your first dose of ICE). You will take the panobinostat on Days -6,&#xD;
      -4, and -2 of Cycle 1 and Days 1, 3, and 5 of Cycles 1 and 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You should take panobinostat around the same time each day with 1 cup (8 ounces) of water.&#xD;
      You should swallow the capsules whole and not chew them. You must avoid grapefruit or&#xD;
      grapefruit juice and seville (sour) oranges while on study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you miss a dose of panobinostat, take it as soon as you remember it on the same day.&#xD;
      However, if more than 12 hours have passed since you were supposed to take the dose, you&#xD;
      should skip that day's dose. In that case, wait to take panobinostat until the next scheduled&#xD;
      dosing day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Visits:&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Days -6 and -2 of Cycle 1, you will have 2 ECGs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Within 7 days before each ICE therapy:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a physical exam, including measurement of your height, weight, and vital&#xD;
           signs.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 2 1/2 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will be asked if you have had any side effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One (1) time a week, blood (2 1/2 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Day 1 of Cycles 2 and beyond, you will have an ECG.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After Cycle 3:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a CT scan of your head and neck, chest, abdomen, and pelvis to check the&#xD;
           status of the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If your bone marrow was positive at screening, you will have a positron emission&#xD;
           tomography (PET) scan to check the status of the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Length of Study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      You be on study for up to 3 cycles (about 42 days). You will be taken off study early if the&#xD;
      disease worsens or you experience intolerable side effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      End-of-Study Visit:&#xD;
&#xD;
      After you are off study, you will have an end-of-study visit at which the following will be&#xD;
      performed:&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will have a physical exam, including measurement of your weight and vital signs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will have an ECG.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an investigational study. Panobinostat is not FDA approved or commercially available.&#xD;
      It is currently being used for research purposes only.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ICE is FDA approved and commercially available for the treatment of several types of&#xD;
      lymphoma, including relapsed and refractory Hodgkins lymphoma. The combination of&#xD;
      panobinostat and ICE for the treatment of Hodgkin's lymphoma is investigational.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 102 patients will take part in this study. All will be enrolled at MD Anderson.&#xD;
&#xD;

      division, which may cause the cells to die.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Etoposide is designed to block cell growth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline Tests:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, the following tests and&#xD;
      procedures will be performed about 7 days before the first dose of the study drug:&#xD;

      You will be randomly assigned (as in the flip of a coin) to 1 of 2 groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If you are in Group 1, you will receive ICE.&#xD;
