  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this phase II study is to gain first information on the efficacy (PFS, ORR&#xD;
      and OS) and safety of lapatinib plus vinorelbine in patients with HER2 positive metastatic&#xD;
      breast cancer pretreated with a combination therapy (chemotherapy and/or hormonal therapy)&#xD;
      including lapatinib and presenting with tumor progression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objective is to assess the efficacy with respect to the percentage of patients&#xD;
      surviving without disease progression as assessed by RECIST criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives are to assess the efficacy of the study treatment with respect to the&#xD;
      objective response rates as assessed by RECIST criteria version 1.1, the overall survival and&#xD;
      to evaluate the safety profile of the combination by recording the adverse events and&#xD;
      abnormal laboratory values associated with the study treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main efficacy endpoints will be investigated both for the intent-to-treat (ITT)&#xD;
      population and the per-protocol (PP) population.&#xD;

      The objective of this phase II study is to gain first information on the efficacy (PFS, ORR&#xD;
      and OS) and safety of lapatinib plus vinorelbine in patients with HER2 positive breast cancer&#xD;
      pretreated with a combination therapy (chemotherapy, hormonal therapy) including lapatinib&#xD;
      for metastatic disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sample size is not based on statistical consideration. Thirty 30 patients are considered&#xD;
      appropriate for a phase II study to gain first information on the efficacy and safety of the&#xD;
      study treatment in the study indication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Only descriptive statistical methods will be used to summarize the study results.&#xD;
      Kaplan-Meier estimates will be calculated for PFS and OS. Median PFS and OS time and&#xD;
      corresponding two sided 95% confidence intervals will be provided.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Categorical endpoints will be summarized in frequency tables and 95% confidence intervals&#xD;
      will be calculated for the objective response rate (ORR) using RECIST.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All safety variables will be summarized descriptively The incidence of adverse events will be&#xD;
      summarized by MedDRA terms in a descriptive manner.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The progression free survival time (PFS) is the primary efficacy endpoint of the study.&#xD;
      Secondary outcomes are overall survival (OS) and objective response rates (ORR) using RECIST.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety outcomes are adverse events, safety laboratory data, physical examinations, vital&#xD;
      signs, LVEF, ECG data and ECOG performance status&#xD;
&#xD;
      Definitions:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective response rate is the rate of subjects with complete response (CR) or partial&#xD;
      response (PR).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Progression-free survival:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The time to progression or death is defined as the time from study entry until the first&#xD;
      observation of disease progression or death due to any cause (whichever occurred earlier).&#xD;
      Only those death will be considered, which occurs within 84 days of the last tumor assessment&#xD;
      or study entry (whichever is later).&#xD;
&#xD;
      If a patient has no progression before a clinical cut-off or the death date is beyond the&#xD;
      above-mentioned time interval after last tumor assessment, time to progression/death is&#xD;
      censored on the date of last tumor assessment or study entry (in case of no post-baseline&#xD;
      tumor assessment).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Overall survival will be calculated from study entry until death. For patients lost to&#xD;
      follow-up, data will be censored at the time the patient was last determined to be alive.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As efficacy data of vinorelbine plus lapatinib are not available so far and the current&#xD;
      protocol is applied as 2nd or 3rd line therapy for metastatic disease an ORR from 30-40% and&#xD;
      a median PFS from 4-6 months is expected.&#xD;
