      The purpose of this study is to evaluate optimal dose and safety of the combination of&#xD;
      Abraxane, gemcitabine, and Xeloda (capecitabine) (AGX) as first-line therapy in patients with&#xD;
      metastatic pancreatic cancer.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PDAC) represents the fourth leading cause of cancer-related&#xD;
      mortality in the United States, with an estimated 35,240 deaths attributable to PDAC in 2009&#xD;
      (1). Over 90% of patients have inoperable disease at presentation, at which point systemic&#xD;
      therapy becomes the primary form of treatment. Single agent gemcitabine became the standard&#xD;
      of care for advanced pancreatic cancer a decade ago since demonstrating improved survival&#xD;
      when compared with fluorouracil. Since then, a number of phase III trials have evaluated the&#xD;
      benefit of adding additional cytotoxic or targeted agents to gemcitabine (2-17).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The PA.3 trial (15), which led to the approval of erlotinib in advanced pancreatic cancer,&#xD;
      was a landmark study in that it represented the first positive phase III study of a&#xD;
      combination regimen for this disease indication; however, while erlotinib represents both an&#xD;
      important proof of principle and a welcome addition to our therapeutic armamentarium, it has&#xD;
      failed to gain significant traction in this disease, as many in the oncology community&#xD;
      consider the marginal absolute improvement in median overall survival to be of questionable&#xD;
      clinical significance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While these studies individually have failed to consistently demonstrate a survival advantage&#xD;
      for gemcitabine-based combination therapy, a recent meta-analysis did show that the addition&#xD;
      of either a platinum analog or a fluoropyrimidine to gemcitabine does result in a significant&#xD;
      improvement in overall survival compared to gemcitabine alone, particularly in patients with&#xD;
      a preserved performance status (18). As described in the following section, the combination&#xD;
      of gemcitabine and capecitabine may be a particularly attractive cytotoxic doublet to build&#xD;
      upon.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Gemcitabine/capecitabine for pancreatic cancer&#xD;
&#xD;
      Gemcitabine and capecitabine have demonstrated synergy in pre-clinical studies, thought to be&#xD;
      due to several mechanisms. Capecitabine is converted to fluorouracil in tissues by pyrimidine&#xD;
      nucleoside phosphorylase (PyNPase), which is over-expressed in many tumors (19). In breast&#xD;
      cancer xenograft models, gemcitabine has been shown to cause increased expression of PyNPase,&#xD;
      which may in turn enhance the conversion of capecitabine to 5-FU (20). An intermediate of&#xD;
      gemcitabine also leads to enhanced binding of the active metabolite of 5-FU to thymidylate&#xD;
      synthase, further augmenting the action of capecitabine (21).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preliminary analysis of one of these studies did show a significant survival benefit with the&#xD;
      combination arm (overall survival 7.4 months versus 6 months; 1 year survival 26% versus&#xD;
      19%); however, final data from this trial have not yet been published (3). A subsequent phase&#xD;
      III Swiss trial did not demonstrate a significant improvement in overall survival with the&#xD;
      combination of gemcitabine/capecitabine as compared to gemcitabine alone; however, a subset&#xD;
      analysis in patients with good performance status (KPS 90-100) did show a significant&#xD;
      survival improvement from 7.4 months to 10.1 months in those who received the combination&#xD;
      regimen (4).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several strategies may further optimize the dose, schedule, and administration of both&#xD;
      gemcitabine and capecitabine. First, delivery of gemcitabine at a fixed-dose rate infusion&#xD;
      (FDR) (10 mg/m2/min) maximizes the intracellular accumulation of the triphosphate form of&#xD;
      this drug. This approach has been evaluated in both a randomized phase II and a phase III&#xD;
      cooperative group trial (ECOG 6201), with some suggestion of benefit compared to&#xD;
      standard-infusion gemcitabine given over 30 minutes (9, 22). Second, administering&#xD;
      capecitabine in a biweekly fashion (7 days on followed by 7 days off) rather than in the&#xD;
      standard 2-week on, 1-week off fashion may allow for dose intensification without increasing&#xD;
      toxicity (23, 24) (see also Part E. below).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The GTX Regimen&#xD;
&#xD;
      The addition of a taxane to gemcitabine/capecitabine has previously been evaluated in the&#xD;
      so-called GTX regimen (fixed-dose rate gemcitabine, docetaxel, capecitabine) (26). Studies of&#xD;
      GTX in advanced pancreatic cancer patients (26, 27) and locally advanced unresectable disease&#xD;
      (28) have revealed encouraging efficacy data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Abraxane (nab-paclitaxel)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Abraxane (nab-paclitaxel, nanoparticle albumin-bound paclitaxel; formerly ABI-007) is a&#xD;
      CremophorÂ® EL-free, albumin-bound form of paclitaxel with a mean particle size of&#xD;
      approximately 130 nanometers. This composition provides a novel approach of increasing&#xD;
      intra-tumoral concentrations of the drug by a receptor-mediated transport process allowing&#xD;
      transcytosis across the endothelial cell.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preclinical studies comparing Abraxane to Taxol (paclitaxel Cremophor EL solvent-based, BMS)&#xD;
      demonstrated lower toxicities, with an MTD approximately 50% higher for Abraxane compared to&#xD;
      Taxol. At equal doses there was less myelosuppression and improved efficacy in a xenograft&#xD;
      tumor model of human mammary adenocarcinoma. At equitoxic doses of paclitaxel, Abraxane was&#xD;
      found to be markedly more efficacious than Taxol (29).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The current FDA-approved indication of Abraxane is for the treatment of breast cancer after&#xD;
      failure of combination chemotherapy for metastatic disease or relapse within 6 months of&#xD;
      adjuvant chemotherapy (prior therapy should have included an anthracycline unless clinically&#xD;
      contraindicated).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our choice of nab-paclitaxel for this proposal is based on provocative preclinical and&#xD;
      clinical data suggesting efficacy of the agent in pancreatic cancer. Specifically, binding of&#xD;
      nab-paclitaxel by an albumin specific receptor (gp60) leads to subsequent activation of a&#xD;
      protein caveolin-1, which mediates internalization of the compound into the endothelial cell&#xD;
      and transport through the bloodstream to the tumor interstitium. SPARC (Secreted Protein And&#xD;
      Rich in Cysteine), a tumor-secreted protein, binds albumin, releasing the active drug at the&#xD;
      tumor cell membrane, thereby increasing its concentration at the target site of action. SPARC&#xD;
      is known to be over-expressed in pancreatic cancers, leading to an interest in studying&#xD;
      nab-paclitaxel in this disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The combination of nab-paclitaxel and gemcitabine in advanced pancreatic cancer demonstrated&#xD;
      very promising results in a phase I/II study (31). In that study, the maximum tolerated dose&#xD;
      of nab-paclitaxel when given concurrently with gemcitabine was 125 mg/m2, both agents&#xD;
      administered weekly x 3 of 4. This same combination of nab-paclitaxel (125 mg/m2) and&#xD;
      gemcitabine (1000 mg/m2) was also shown to be well tolerated in a phase II trial in&#xD;
      metastatic breast cancer (32), with both agents administered on a 2-week-on, 1-week-off&#xD;
      schedule. Of note, the pivotal study upon which nab-paclitaxel was approved for use in breast&#xD;
      cancer used a dose of 260 mg/m2, as a single agent, on an every 3 week schedule.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The doses of nab-paclitaxel to be tested in our proposed dose-escalation trial, when combined&#xD;
      with gemcitabine and capecitabine using an alternating-week dose schedule, will range between&#xD;
      75 and 150 mg/m2.&#xD;
