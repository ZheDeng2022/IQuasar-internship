  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Rationale: Diabetic neuropathy is one of the most common complications of Diabetes Mellitus&#xD;
      (DM). Pain is a common symptom of diabetic neuropathy, affecting 11-34% of patients suffering&#xD;
      form DM. The burden of disease of painful diabetic polyneuropathy (PDP) is high for both the&#xD;
      patient and society, due to significant pain levels, frequent co-morbidity, polypharmacy and&#xD;
      significant health resource use. Spinal cord stimulation (SCS) has been used for over 30&#xD;
      years to treat neuropathic pain. Several small clinical studies have shown a beneficial&#xD;
      effect of SCS on pain in PDP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: The primary objective of this study is to investigate whether SCS leads to&#xD;
      clinically relevant (≥50%) pain relief in patients with moderate-to-severe PDP in the lower&#xD;
      limbs after 6 months of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives to investigate 1) the effect of SCS on health related quality of life in&#xD;
      PDP; 2) the effect of SCS on the quality of sleep in PDP; 3) the effect of SCS on mood in&#xD;
      PDP; 4) the effect of SCS on blood glucose control in PDP; 5) the effect of SCS on large and&#xD;
      small nerve fibre functions in PDP; 6) identifying predictive factors for success of SCS&#xD;
      treatment of PDP; after 6 months 7) the effect of SCS on small fibre loss and regeneration in&#xD;
      PDP; and 8) costs, cost-utility and cost-effectiveness after 12 months of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design: the study is a multi centre randomized controlled trial. Study population:&#xD;
      Patients suffering from moderate-to-severe PDP in the lower limbs due to diabetes mellitus&#xD;
      type 1 or type 2 as diagnosed by clinical symptoms (glove and stocking distribution).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention: patients assigned to group 1 will receive spinal cord stimulation (SCS) and/or&#xD;
      best (drug) treatment as possible, patients assigned to group 2 will receive best (drug)&#xD;
      treatment as possible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main study parameters/endpoints: The main study parameter will be the mean pain intensity&#xD;
      and/or maximal pain intensity during daytime and/or during night time as measured on a&#xD;
      weighted NRS and/or a PGIC for pain and sleep measured on a 7-point Likert scale, after 6&#xD;
      months of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nature and extent of the burden and risks associated with participation, benefit and group&#xD;
      relatedness: SCS related risks include: lead migration (14%), lead breakage (7%), implanted&#xD;
      pulse generator migration (1%), loss of therapeutic effect, lost or unpleasant paresthesias&#xD;
      (12%), infection or wound breakdown (10%), Pain at IPG incision site (12%), IPG pocket fluid&#xD;
      collection (5%). Treatment-as-usual related risks are related to the medication used and do&#xD;
      not increase due to participation in this study.&#xD;

    <description>The intervention is spinal cord stimulation and will be used for 2 weeks trial stimulation. After clinical successful pain relief (≥50% relief of pain intensity on a weighted numeric rating scale (NRS) or a score of ≥6 on a seven-point Likert scale (1=very much worse; 7=very much improved) of the PGIC scale for pain and sleep) a definite spinal cord system will be implanted.</description>
