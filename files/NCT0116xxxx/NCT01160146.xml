  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Overweight and obesity has become an epidemic which warrants more aggressive treatment.&#xD;
      However, few primary care physicians (PCPs) address this issue or do not possess adequate&#xD;
      education regarding treatment modalities such as nutrition counseling or bariatric surgery.&#xD;
      The primary goal of this study will be to determine whether the referrals for weight&#xD;
      management can be influenced through obesity education.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Evaluation of educational interventions focusing on the treatment of obesity will include in&#xD;
      person CME sessions, interactive game/virtual patient computer software and two 30 minute&#xD;
      DVD/Web-based CME opportunities that the physicians can review at their leisure. These&#xD;
      educational interventions were not completed as part of this research.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A control group will be comprised of those healthcare professionals who did not complete the&#xD;
      CME survey.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Completion of the post education survey would be completed even if there was no study. The&#xD;
      reward given to PCP's (free enrollment in CME session and either lab coat or $40 CME credit)&#xD;
      was given for clinical purposes only and not for research. The study consists of the&#xD;
      collection of PCP referral rates prior to the educational opportunity and then after the CME&#xD;
      looking for a change to referral rates.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In June of 2009, an Obesity Educational Intervention Summit was attended by PCPs. This&#xD;
      research seeks approval to perform data pulls consisting of referrals from their practice to&#xD;
      the GI/Nutrition Clinic for potential bariatric surgery evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The information to be collected regarding the primary care providers' referral rates will be&#xD;
      collected by a CDIS data pull by a data broker. The biostatistician will link survey&#xD;
      responses to referral patterns and education type and will be true, only individual to have&#xD;
      access to direct identifiers and in turn will provide PI and study team with de-identified&#xD;
      summary data.&#xD;
