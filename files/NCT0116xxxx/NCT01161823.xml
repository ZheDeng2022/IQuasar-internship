    <textblock>
      After menopause the coronary artery disease (CAD) risk increases rapidly to an equivalent&#xD;
      risk of men with the same age. The rising incidence of CAD could be a subsequent decline of&#xD;
      endogenous estrogen blood levels after the menopause. Estrogen leads to vasodilation and&#xD;
      vasoprotection through an increase of Nitric Oxide (NO). NO deficiency results in endothelial&#xD;
      stiffness and dysfunction with a subsequent initiation of atherosclerosis. Menopausal status&#xD;
      is associated with an increase of the sympathetic nerve activity leading to hypertension,&#xD;
      increased heart rate and palpitations. Recent studies show an importance of vasoactive&#xD;
      substances (e.g. NO) in the physiology of hot flashes. Thus, hot flashes may be associated&#xD;
      with a decreased NO production and release. Additionally, it is well known that during and&#xD;
      after menopause women experience a change in sexual function (declined libido and increased&#xD;
      dyspareunia) due to decreasing estrogen blood levels. Recently, a new angiostatic parameter -&#xD;
      Endostatin (ENST) - has been shown to be involved in EC function. There is also evidence that&#xD;
      ENST levels increase during NO stimulation. Nebivolol, a ß-blocker of the third generation,&#xD;
      has been shown to release NO to a significant amount in the EC. It is safe and effective in&#xD;
      reducing blood pressure to the target level. However, there is no data of the effect of&#xD;
      Nebivolol on sexual function, on clinical symptoms (palpitations, increased heart rate and&#xD;
      hot flashes) and ENST in postmenopausal women. The present study investigates the effect of a&#xD;
      NO-releasing ß-blocker compared to a phytoestrogen therapy considering clinical signs of&#xD;
      menopause such as palpitations, hot flashes and sexual functioning in postmenopausal women.&#xD;
      Therefore, the use of a ß-blocker treatment is warranted. Further, this study tries to&#xD;
      elucidate the role of NO release in postmenopausal symptoms and may gain new insights in the&#xD;
      pathophysiology of hot flashes and increased sympathetic nerve activity. Thus, this trial&#xD;
      should explore an advantage of Nebivolol therapy in contrast to a phytoestrogen therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Null hypothesis: Climacteric disorders as measured by the MRS-II in patients with a Nebivolol&#xD;
      therapy is not lower than in patients with phytoestrogen therapy. Alternative hypothesis:&#xD;
      Climacteric disorders in patients as measured by the MRS-II with a Nebivolol therapy is lower&#xD;
      than in patients with phytoestrogen therapy.&#xD;

      1. Background&#xD;
&#xD;
           CAD is the leading cause of mortality for women in US as well as in Austria and most&#xD;
           developed countries.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Major risk factors are hypertension, diabetes and the postmenopausal status. After the&#xD;
           menopause the CAD risk increases rapidly to an equivalent risk of men with the same age.&#xD;
&#xD;
           In all ethnic groups, hypertension is more prevalent among women than men after the age&#xD;
           of 59. Over 75 years 75,2 % of females and 63,7% of males perform a hypertensive&#xD;
           vascular status.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Menopausal status is associated with a decline of endogenous estrogen levels resulting&#xD;
           in a manifest estrogen deficiency. This estrogen decline is also associated with a&#xD;
           subsequent increased risk for CAD.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The main effect of estrogen is a vasodilatation and an anti-atherosclerotic action&#xD;
           through different mechanisms.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Recent studies are describing that the estrogen deficiency and the subsequently NO&#xD;
           deficiency results in a disordered endothelial function and a permanent&#xD;
           vasoconstriction, that is one of the major reasons for postmenopausal hypertension and&#xD;
           CAD.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Clinical symptoms of postmenopausal women:&#xD;
&#xD;
           - Palpitations and tachycardia Postmenopausal women complain about heart palpitations,&#xD;
           throbbing and subjective sensed high heart rate and tachycardia, which can be explained&#xD;
           by a sympathetic over activity in postmenopausal women.&#xD;
&#xD;
           This clinical symptoms are associated with a significant decrease in quality of life and&#xD;
           well- being in postmenopausal women.&#xD;
&#xD;
           - Hot flashes Hot flashes are the most common symptom and occur in most postmenopausal&#xD;
           women (75%). Hot flashes are experienced as a feeling of intense heat with sweating and&#xD;
           rapid heartbeat. The typical duration is between two and thirty minutes. Risk factors&#xD;
           for hot flashes are - equal to CVD - high body mass index and smoking.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Furthermore, it can be supposed that the NO decrease in postmenopausal women is&#xD;
           responsible for the hot flashes.&#xD;
&#xD;
           - Sexuality Sexuality is an important quality-of-life issue, also in elderly. Therefore,&#xD;
           sexual dysfunction is considered a serious quality-of-life-related health problem.&#xD;
           Furthermore increasing dyspareunia and decreasing libido and responsivity correlated&#xD;
           with decreasing estrogen levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
           - Endostatin (ENST) ENST, a 20-kDa C-terminal fragment cleaved from type XVIII collagen,&#xD;
           is a naturally occurring protein that blocks the formation of blood vessels, inhibits EC&#xD;
           proliferation, migration and angiogenesis. Furthermore, there is evidence that ENST&#xD;
           induces an acute NO release and finally leads to vasodilation and therefore works&#xD;
           against endothelial dysfunction.&#xD;
&#xD;
           However, since there is no data on ENST serum levels in postmenopausal women as well of&#xD;
           the effect of Nebivolol on ENST serum levels, we will investigate baseline ENST levels&#xD;
           and after 3 month of treatment compared to patients treated with phytohormones.&#xD;
&#xD;
           - Nebivolol Nebivolol, a ß-blocker of the third generation, has been shown to lower&#xD;
           blood pressure with great safety and efficacy in men as well in women and was well&#xD;
           tolerated.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Beneath its specific beta-1-receptor blockade Nebivolol has a NO-releasing effect&#xD;
           through a ß3-receptor-agonism. Nebivolol combines a potent ß1-adrenoreceptor-blocking&#xD;
           activity (mostly ascribed to its D-enantiomer) with additional vasodilating properties&#xD;
           (attributed to its L-enantiomer and also D-enantiomer).&#xD;
&#xD;
           Nebivolol causes a vasodilatation of the vessels and reduces the progress of&#xD;
           atherosclerosis which is a main risk factor for CVD and hypertension.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The current general guidelines for hypertension recommend treatment with a Thiazide&#xD;
           Diuretic as a first line medication in hypertension. In contrary to Diuretics and&#xD;
           ACE-blockers - ß-blockers also reduce the heart rate and have positive antagonistic&#xD;
           influence on the sympathetic nerve system. The augmentation of the heart rate during the&#xD;
           menopause is sensed as a very unpleasant and unbearable situation for most of the&#xD;
           postmenopausal women. Thus, the increase in sympathetic nerve activity and clinical&#xD;
           symptoms of palpitations or increased heart rate warrant the use of a ß-blocker for the&#xD;
           treatment in our cohort.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Additionally, we hypothesise, that through an improvement of the endothelial function&#xD;
           with Nebivolol the number of hot flashes in postmenopausal women can be reduced.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Recent studies have shown positive effects on the erectile dysfunction in men during&#xD;
           treatment with Nebivolol. As the physiologic and embryologic conditions are almost&#xD;
           similar in men and women, so we expect similar improving effects on the sexual&#xD;
           dysfunction in our female study group.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Therefore, we want to investigate the effect of Nebivolol on blood pressure, heart rate,&#xD;
           hot flashes, sexual function, ENST, testosterone levels in postmenopausal women with&#xD;
           menopausal disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
           1.2 Rationale of the study&#xD;
&#xD;
           We want to investigate the effect of Nebivolol in comparison to a phytoestrogen therapy&#xD;
           on climacteric disorders as measured by the Menopausal rating scale II (MRS-II). In&#xD;
           addition we will investigate the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
           - the heart rate&#xD;
&#xD;
           - the number of palpitations&#xD;
&#xD;
           - the number of hot flushes&#xD;
&#xD;
           - the sexual function&#xD;
&#xD;
           - the blood pressure&#xD;
&#xD;
           - the serum level of Endostatin&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  the serum level of Testosterone in postmenopausal women.&#xD;
&#xD;
                2 METHODS 2.1 Measurement of the blood pressure Measurement of the blood pressure&#xD;
                according to Riva Rocci will be performed at the beginning and after 12 weeks (end&#xD;
                of the study). Measurements will be taken in sitting position after five minutes&#xD;
                rest. Three consecutive measurements will be taken and the average of these&#xD;
                measurements will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
           2.2 ECG A 12-lead ECG will be written to rule out AV-block and bradycardia (&lt;50/min).&#xD;
&#xD;
           2.3 Blood parameters&#xD;
&#xD;
           Prestudy screening:&#xD;
&#xD;
           - FSH&#xD;
&#xD;
           - TSH&#xD;
&#xD;
           - testosterone&#xD;
&#xD;
           - estrogen&#xD;
&#xD;
           - DHEA&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  SHBG&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  prolactin&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  BNP&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  hsCRP&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  liver parameters&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  kidney parameters&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  electrolytes&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  blood glucose&#xD;
&#xD;
           Our patients have to show a blood level of estrogen &lt;20pg/ml and FSH &gt;35 mIU/ml to&#xD;
           verify the status of menopause.&#xD;
&#xD;
           To rule out another endocrine cause of a possible sexual function alteration we check&#xD;
           the blood levels of TSH, Prolactin, DHEA (Dehydroepiandrosterone) and SHBG (Sex Hormon&#xD;
           Binding Globulin).&#xD;
&#xD;
           2.4 Analysis of Endostatin Within the routine blood analysis we will also detect the&#xD;
           blood level of ENST.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The RD191076100 Human Endostatin ELISA is a sandwich enzyme immunoassay for the&#xD;
           quantitative measurement of endostatin protein in human serum.&#xD;
&#xD;
           2.5 Female Sexual Function Index We will use the German version of the female sexual&#xD;
           function index (FSFI-D) that was validated in 2004. This questionnaire is a proven&#xD;
           instrument to evaluate the female sexual function especially in (post)menopausal women.&#xD;
&#xD;
           We will hand out this questionnaire twice: At the beginning and after our study (12&#xD;
           weeks later). During the completion of the questionnaire by the study participant, a&#xD;
           gynecologist will be attendant to help the women to complete the questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
           This way we want to analyze if the treatment with Nebivolol has an effect on the sexual&#xD;
           function of women. We have added the questionnaire to the appendix.&#xD;
&#xD;
           2.6 Menopausal Rating Scale II We are going to use the Menopause Rating Scale II (MRS&#xD;
           II). This self-assessment scale to quantify menopausal symptoms includes 11 questions to&#xD;
           evaluate the &quot;quality of life&quot; in our cohort.&#xD;
&#xD;
           We will hand out this questionnaire twice: At the beginning and after our study (12&#xD;
           weeks later). During the completion of the questionnaire by the study participant, a&#xD;
           gynecologist will be attendant to help the women to complete the questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
           2.7 Hot flashes/palpitations diary At the beginning of our study, the diary will be&#xD;
           introduced to the patients by the treating physician. There the number of hot flashes&#xD;
           and palpitations per day should be written down. The diary contains 12 pages, one page a&#xD;
           week.&#xD;
&#xD;
           At the beginning we will perform an anamnesis to get informed about the average number&#xD;
           of hot flashes and palpitations per day before the medication.&#xD;
