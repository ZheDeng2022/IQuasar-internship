  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The majority of trans fatty acids consumed by the general population is derived from products&#xD;
      that have been formulated using significant amount of hydrogenated vegetable oil (the&#xD;
      so-called industrial trans fat). Fat from ruminants also contains small amounts of trans&#xD;
      fatty acid, which contribute, although to a smaller extent, to the total dietary intake of&#xD;
      trans fatty acids in the general population. The negative impact of consuming industrial&#xD;
      trans fat on health, particularly on cardiovascular disease, is being increasingly&#xD;
      recognized. Based on data available to date, it is currently not possible to conclude if&#xD;
      effects of ruminants and industrial trans fatty acid on cardiovascular risk are different.&#xD;
      There is therefore an urgent need for a study that compares the impact of naturally occurring&#xD;
      trans fatty acids such as those from dairy products and of trans fatty acids form industrial&#xD;
      sources on cardiovascular risk factors as well as their mechanisms of action.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The general objective of the study is to investigate the impact of naturally occurring trans&#xD;
      fatty acids from dairy products (mainly vaccenic acid) on plasma cholesterol levels and other&#xD;
      risk factors for cardiovascular disease.&#xD;

      The proposed research will be undertaken as a double-blind randomized cross-over study&#xD;
      according to a Latin Square design, with participants being subjected to 4 consecutive&#xD;
      isocaloric diets in random order lasting 4 weeks each. No stratification is considered since&#xD;
      the population recruited will be relatively homogeneous. The 4 experimental diets are: 1- a&#xD;
      diet rich in ruminant TFA (8 g/day); 2- a diet moderately rich in ruminant TFA (4 g/day); 3-&#xD;
      a diet rich in industrial TFA (8 g/d); 4- a control diet (minimal dietary TFA of industrial&#xD;
      and ruminant sources). The source of ruminant TFA will come from butter and cream obtained&#xD;
      after having modified the regimen of lactating cows in a fashion similar to the one used to&#xD;
      increase the levels of conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) in milk fat. Hydrogenated margarine&#xD;
      will be used as the main source of industrial TFA. Finally, a butter obtained from cows&#xD;
      producing the lowest levels of ruminant fat will be used to formulate the control diet&#xD;
      (minimal dietary TFA). All diets will be identical in terms of menus, calories and&#xD;
      macronutrient composition with the exception of TFA sources and levels. Minor differences in&#xD;
      the levels of total saturated, monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fatty acids will be&#xD;
      matched across diets by adding various vegetable and animal oils. The macronutrient&#xD;
      composition of each meal and thus of the entire day is very similar across all 4 diets. Based&#xD;
      on a 2500 kcal/day regimen, an intake of TFA of 8 g/d and 4 g/d will represent 72 kcal/day&#xD;
      and 36 kcal/day respectively (3% and 1.5% of energy intake). The 4 experimental diets will be&#xD;
      formulated so that the percentage of daily calories from fat (36%), carbohydrates (50%) and&#xD;
      proteins (14%) will meet most of the dietary recommendations of the American Heart&#xD;
      Association and the NCEP for primary prevention of CVD, with the exception of SAT (slight&#xD;
      excess) and fibers (slight deficit). The slight excess in SAT fat cannot be avoided since we&#xD;
      are using butter as the primary source of ruminant TFA. The cholesterol content of the&#xD;
      experimental diet will not exceed 300 mg/day.&#xD;
