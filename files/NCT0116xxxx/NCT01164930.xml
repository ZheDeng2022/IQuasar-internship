      The purpose of this randomized controlled trial is to evaluate the effectiveness of an&#xD;
      empirically supported psychosocial treatment, Acceptance and Commitment Therapy, in&#xD;
      facilitating improved quality of life, benefit-finding, and cortisol rhythm in breast cancer&#xD;
      patients in an outpatient clinical oncology setting.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Previous research indicates that breast cancer patients may demonstrate disrupted diurnal&#xD;
      cortisol rhythms compared to healthy individuals, and that these disrupted rhythms may be&#xD;
      related to recurrence and earlier mortality in some patients. Interestingly, improvements in&#xD;
      cortisol regulation in previous intervention studies for cancer patients have not necessarily&#xD;
      been related to decreased distress. Rather, improvements in post-traumatic growth,&#xD;
      benefit-finding, and meaningfulness have also accounted for improved neuroendocrine and&#xD;
      immunological changes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Traditional breast cancer groups, however, may not adequately address these areas because&#xD;
      existing interventions often target the reduction of distress as the primary vehicle to&#xD;
      improve psychosocial, quality of life, and biophysical outcomes. Acceptance and Commitment&#xD;
      Therapy (ACT) is an empirically-supported, mindfulness-based psychological treatment that has&#xD;
      been shown to enhance meaningful behavior change thorough increasing emotional acceptance of&#xD;
      difficult psychological experiences such as distress, without the goal of changing or&#xD;
      eliminating them.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The current study seeks to determine the preliminary effect of an 8-week ACT group in&#xD;
      increasing positive life changes and corresponding increase in salivary cortisol slope in 40&#xD;
      distressed breast cancer patients, who will be randomly assigned to ACT or a wait list&#xD;
      control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypotheses for the present study include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients receiving ACT will demonstrate improvements in Quality of Life (QoL),&#xD;
           Benefit-finding (BF), and health behavior compared to control group participants&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  ACT participants will demonstrate improvements in mean cortisol levels and cortisol&#xD;
           reactivity compared to control group participants&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  These changes will be the result of increased mindful acceptance of cancer-related&#xD;
           distress and meaningful behavior changes, rather than a reduction in distress.&#xD;
