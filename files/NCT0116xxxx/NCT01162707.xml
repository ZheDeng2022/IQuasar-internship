  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the trial is to evaluate the wireless monitoring of pulmonary artery pressure&#xD;
      using the CardioMEMS HF Pressure Measurement System in adult subjects with NYHA Class III&#xD;
      Heart Failure.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The trial is designed to demonstrate that the CardioMEMS Sensor can be positioned in the&#xD;
      right or left pulmonary artery, and that Sensor pressure measurements correlate to&#xD;
      standardized methods of intra-cardiac pressure measurements post-sensor implant and at the 60&#xD;
      day visit. Safety will be monitored by the occurrence of adverse events throughout the trial.&#xD;

    <time_frame>after implant of the sensor and at 60 day visit</time_frame>
    <description>The trial will demonstrate that the CardioMEMS Sensor can be positioned in the right or left pulmonary artery, and the Sensor pulmonary artery pressure measurements correlate to standardized methods of intra-cardiac pressure measurements immediately after deployment of the sensor and at the 60 day follow-up visit. Safety is assessed by monitoring the occurrence of adverse events.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>To demonstrate the capability of the CardioMEMS HF System to obtain the pressure measurement from the Sensor and transmit the pulmonary artery pressure data to a secure database.</measure>
