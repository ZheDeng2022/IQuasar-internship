      This study proposes to describe how children s hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) risk status&#xD;
      affects family functioning, behaviors, and relationships. HCM is the most common inherited&#xD;
      cardiovascular single-gene disorder. Individuals with HCM may experience shortness of breath,&#xD;
      chest pain, palpitations, dizziness, syncope, heart failure, and arrhythmias predisposing to&#xD;
      sudden cardiac death at any age. Notably, HCM is the most common cause of sudden cardiac&#xD;
      death in people under 30 years of age. Genetic testing can identify at-risk individuals;&#xD;
      however, the impact of potentially life-altering genetic information on families remains&#xD;
      largely unexplored. Increasingly, health care providers are providing the testing in children&#xD;
      for conditions like HCM that are life-threatening and medically manageable without the&#xD;
      benefit of understanding the psychological consequences. The few studies that have been&#xD;
      conducted suggest that genetic testing in children may result in changes to family&#xD;
      relationships, parental emotional wellbeing, parenting behaviors, and child functioning in a&#xD;
      subset of children. One synthesis of these studies suggests that children as a group show&#xD;
      little evidence for maladjustment to risk information, but that parents are affected by the&#xD;
      carrier status of their children. The proposed study intends to further this body of&#xD;
      knowledge by exploring the impact of children s risk status on families with HCM. Health care&#xD;
      providers and researchers can inform their work with HCM families by better understanding the&#xD;
      potential impact of genetic risk as an important component of families adaptation to the&#xD;
      life-threatening information about their children. The families targeted for this exploratory&#xD;
      study will be purposively sampled from those that have been aware of the children s risk&#xD;
      status or not at-risk status for HCM for at least 3 months. The cross-sectional design is&#xD;
      composed of semi-structured interviews with a parent and, separately, with his/her 13 to 23&#xD;
      year-old child who is either a carrier for HCM, a non-carrier, or at 50% risk for being a&#xD;
      carrier. The interview will target issues related to the perceived impact of the child s risk&#xD;
      status on family functioning, parenting behaviors and relationships. Data from the&#xD;
      parent-child dyads will be analyzed for concordance/discordance along parallel themes. The&#xD;
      results of this study may facilitate the understanding of the perceived impact of learning&#xD;
      children s HCM risk status, which will inform both clinical care and future research.&#xD;
      Importantly, since predictive testing in children for adult-onset diseases is generally&#xD;
      discouraged, very little is actually known about its impact on families. Therefore, the study&#xD;
      of this unique subgroup of an HCM population that uses clinically indicated predictive&#xD;
      testing in childhood offers a preliminary opportunity to learn about predictive testing of&#xD;
      minors....&#xD;
