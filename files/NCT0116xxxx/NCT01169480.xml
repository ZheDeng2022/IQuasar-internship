      The aim of this study is to investigate if giving a massage impacts the mental state of a&#xD;
      massage therapist, including depression, anxiety, and stress . It is speculated that feelings&#xD;
      of depression, anxiety and stress will reduce following the giving of a massage.&#xD;

      Background It is well established that massage is beneficial for musculoskeletal conditions&#xD;
      such as low back pain1-3 and neck pain. In addition, massage has been shown to alleviate&#xD;
      depressive symptoms and reduce state anxiety and perceived stress. Furthermore, the&#xD;
      therapeutic benefits of touch itself are recognized for many conditions and in many stages of&#xD;
      life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus far all massage research has investigated the impact of massage on the massage client,&#xD;
      or the receiver of the massage. No peer-reviewed study was found that reported any&#xD;
      biopsychosocial effects on the giver of the massage, the massage therapist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With touch therapies such as massage, it is impossible to touch without being touched&#xD;
      oneself. Therefore, it is speculated that the giver of a touch therapy will also receive a&#xD;
      therapeutic benefit. In fact, it has been reported anecdotally that massage therapists often&#xD;
      feel &quot;better&quot; after they give a massage than before. Feelings of exhilaration, enhanced&#xD;
      well-being, and improved energy are common.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to investigate if giving a massage impacts the state of mind of&#xD;
      massage therapists, including depression, anxiety, and stress.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants For this study, 22 participants who are massage therapists, students of massage&#xD;
      or recent graduates will be recruited from the Parker School of Massage Therapy(PSMT).&#xD;
      Participants will be included if they are healthy and aged between 18 and 65 years old, and&#xD;
      excluded if they currently have any of the following conditions: contusion, fracture,&#xD;
      inflammatory arthritides, peripheral neuropathy, or pregnancy. Of the eligible volunteers,&#xD;
      ten participants will be randomly selected to the experimental group, while the other ten&#xD;
      participants will act as controls. All interventions will occur in the PSMT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interventions Participants in the experimental group will be asked to give one 50-minute&#xD;
      Swedish massage to another volunteer. Control participants will be asked to wait in a&#xD;
      classroom (i.e. do nothing) for the same amount of time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives The aim of this study is to investigate if giving a massage impacts the mental&#xD;
      state of a massage therapist, including depression, anxiety, and stress. It is speculated&#xD;
      that feelings of depression, anxiety and stress will reduce following the giving of a&#xD;
      massage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcomes The primary assessment measure will be the Depression, Anxiety, Stress Scales&#xD;
      (DASS). The DASS is a set of three self-report scales measuring the affective states of&#xD;
      depression (&quot;D&quot;), anxiety (&quot;A&quot;) and stress (&quot;S&quot;). Each of the 21 items is scored from &quot;0&quot;&#xD;
      (Did not apply to me at all) to &quot;3&quot; (Applied to me very much or most of the time). A template&#xD;
      is used to score the test and subscore is achieved for each of the three subcategories.&#xD;
      Subscores can range from 0 to 28+, with normals being at the lower end of the range. The DASS&#xD;
      was found to have adequate convergent and discriminant validity and good reliability,&#xD;
      including test-retest reliability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcome measure will be the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory-II (STAI). The STAI is a&#xD;
      self-report measure that assesses both state anxiety (i.e. feelings at present moment) and&#xD;
      trait anxiety (i.e. general feelings). The 40 items are measured on a 4-point Likert scale&#xD;
      (1=Almost Never to 4=Almost Always). Scores are obtained for each subscale (State and Trait&#xD;
      Anxiety) with the higher scores indicating higher anxiety. The STAI has been shown to be&#xD;
      valuable in both research and clinical settings, and has been found to have high internal&#xD;
      consistency, and excellent test-retest reliability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample Size Sample size estimation was performed based on the primary outcome measure, the&#xD;
      DASS. A minimum change in the total DASS score of 10 points is predicted using results from a&#xD;
      similar effectiveness studies. Using the DSS Research Sample Size Calculator Software&#xD;
      http://www.dssresearch.com/toolkit/sscalc/size_a2.asp), and a 5% level of confidence a total&#xD;
      of 22 participants (11 per group) would be required for a statistical power of 0.81. We do&#xD;
      not anticipate any loss-to-follow up and thus have not made any further adjustment for&#xD;
      attrition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization &amp; Blinding Participants meeting the eligibility criteria will be pooled and a&#xD;
      random drawing will determine which individuals will be in the experimental group and give&#xD;
      the massage and which will act as controls. An independent assistant will perform the&#xD;
      randomization process. Another independent assistant who is blind to group allocation will&#xD;
      administer the assessment measures. Participants will be blind to group allocation for the&#xD;
      duration of the study. While it is very difficult to blind participants when hands-on&#xD;
      therapies are investigated, in this study this will be accomplished because giving a massage&#xD;
      is a routine part of the day for these participants.&#xD;
