      The main objective is to investigate if the brain activation signature of a typical&#xD;
      antipsychotic agent is dissociable from a newer drug with a pharmacological profile that&#xD;
      differs from both typical and atypical antipsychotics since it is a potent partial D2&#xD;
      agonist. The method used to study this will be functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI).&#xD;

      The advent of neuroimaging has opened a new window into the human brain. Here, we propose to&#xD;
      investigate if the activation signature of a traditional antipsychotic agent is dissociable&#xD;
      from a new drug with a unique pharmacological profile that differs from both typical and the&#xD;
      more recent atypical antipsychotics. The introduction of aripiprazole is of interest because&#xD;
      while clinically it has all the features of an atypical antipsychotic (antipsychotic effect&#xD;
      with very low motor side effects) it differs from all other antipsychotics in that it is a&#xD;
      partial D2 receptor agonist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Antipsychotic drugs can be classified as either typical or atypical. Typical antipsychotics,&#xD;
      like haloperidol, are dopamine antagonists which are clinically efficacious when they occupy&#xD;
      60-70% of the striatal dopamine D2 receptors, and extra pyramidal side (EPS) effects begin to&#xD;
      show when D2 receptor occupancy (D2RO) is &gt;80%. Atypicals, like the typicals, are&#xD;
      efficacious; however, they are unique insofar as they have a low affinity for dopamine&#xD;
      receptors, target other neurotransmitter systems (in particular the serotonergic system), and&#xD;
      show low motor side effects. While most atypicals are dopamine antagonists, a new class of&#xD;
      antipsychotics characterized as partial agonists have emerged. Aripiprazole is one of these&#xD;
      novel partial agonists. It has the ability to act as an antagonist in the presence of high&#xD;
      concentrations of dopamine and as an agonist in low concentrations. Animal models can be used&#xD;
      to predict both the clinical efficacy of antipsychotics as well as to predict their&#xD;
      propensity to induce EPS. What follows is a comparison of the behavior of the typical&#xD;
      antagonist haloperidol and the novel partial antagonist aripiprazole in these models. Both&#xD;
      haloperidol and aripiprazole show dose-dependent striatal D2 receptor occupancy (D2RO)&#xD;
      (Natesan et al., 2006). In two measures of clinical efficacy, conditioned avoidance response&#xD;
      (CAR) and amphetamine induced locomotion (AIL), haloperidol and aripiprazole behave&#xD;
      differently. Haloperidol's ED50 for the inhibition of CAR and AIL corresponds to ~60% D2RO.&#xD;
      Aripiprazole, however, shows dissociation between function and occupancy. While aripiprazole&#xD;
      is similar to haloperidol in that it blocks AIL at ~60% D2RO, it differs in that a 23-fold&#xD;
      higher dose, corresponding to an 86% D2RO is required to inhibit CAR. It has been suggested&#xD;
      by Natesan et al., 2006 that this functional dissociation occurs as a result of&#xD;
      aripiprazole's partial agonist property. If aripiprazole has approximately 20% in vivo&#xD;
      intrinsic activity, this could raise the threshold for CAR inhibition from the ~60% D2RO seen&#xD;
      in haloperidol to the ~85% D2RO seen in aripiprazole. A similar result to that in the CAR&#xD;
      model is found in another measure of clinical efficacy - FOS expression in the shell of the&#xD;
      nucleus accumbens (NAcc). While haloperidol induced FOS at a dose corresponding to ~60% D2RO,&#xD;
      an ~80% D2RO was needed for aripiprazole. Despite the &gt;80% D2RO required for aripiprazole to&#xD;
      be efficacious in the CAR model, and induce FOS in the NAcc shell, catalepsy was not present.&#xD;
      This is contrary to what is seen in the typicals, including haloperidol. It is also&#xD;
      surprising, as aripiprazole D2ROs &gt;80% induce FOS in the core of the NAcc and the&#xD;
      dorsolateral striatum (a marker for catalepsy and extrapyramidal symptoms).&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is well established that animals treated with low doses of antipsychotic drugs fail to&#xD;
      acquire or perform avoidance responses to a conditioned stimulus (CS) that is associated to&#xD;
      an aversive unconditioned stimulus (US), whereas their escape responses to that stimulus are&#xD;
      not affected in aversive avoidance paradigms. This selective disruption of avoidance, but not&#xD;
      escape responses, is a characteristic pharmacologic effect of all antipsychotics, including&#xD;
      newer atypical ones. This feature has been effectively used to differentiate antipsychotic&#xD;
      medication from other classes of psychotropic drugs to predict their clinical potencies and&#xD;
      to identify potential drugs to be used as antipsychotics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      More appetitive paradigms where animals have to work for rewarding stimuli (food, water, sex,&#xD;
      brain stimulation) show a dramatic decrement in performance/pursuit when administered&#xD;
      antipsychotics. This deficit can be reversed with dopamine agonists such as amphetamine and&#xD;
      thus suggesting symmetrical effects of dopamine agonists and antagonists in these kinds of&#xD;
      paradigms. While typical antipsychotics like haloperidol reduce impact of both appetitive and&#xD;
      aversive CSs but not the US at doses producing &gt;60% D2 occupancy, it has been reported that&#xD;
      aripiprazole was effective at doses that gave rise to occupancies of &gt;85%. This has to be&#xD;
      examined in humans and functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) might be a tool specific&#xD;
      and sensitive enough.&#xD;
&#xD;
      fMRI is now a standard tool in human brain imaging and provides a good spatial resolution at&#xD;
      the millimeter level with a second level temporal resolution. Event-related fMRI, wherein&#xD;
      brain responses are recorded in response to specific events, are optimally suited for&#xD;
      studying the neurobiology of phenomena such as classical conditioning in humans. In a&#xD;
      previous event-related fMRI study from our group, using Pavlovian aversive conditioning, the&#xD;
      ventral striatum was reliably and directly activated in three experiments. These results have&#xD;
      been replicated in healthy controls, whereas patients with schizophrenia have shown a&#xD;
      different activation pattern. The ventral striatum was activated in the anticipation of&#xD;
      aversive events regardless of whether there was an opportunity to avoid the aversive stimulus&#xD;
      (similar to the animal models described above) or not. Thus, our data suggested that the&#xD;
      ventral striatum, a crucial element of the dopaminergic mesolimbic &quot;reward&quot; system, is&#xD;
      directly activated in anticipation of aversive stimuli. Similar to other conditioning studies&#xD;
      we also found robust activations of the anterior insula and anterior cingulate, both parts of&#xD;
      the greater limbic cortex and projects to the ventral striatum. The anterior insula has been&#xD;
      proposed to play a role in processing emotional relevant contexts such as disgust and pain&#xD;
      whereas the anterior cingulate is involved in assessing motivational content of internal and&#xD;
      external stimuli and regulating context dependent behavior. Both structures have extensive&#xD;
      connections with the amygdala which is the substrate most commonly associated with fear.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The field of pharmacological fMRI is emerging and some early studies have demonstrated the&#xD;
      proof of principle that drugs can influence activations. The dopamine system has been the&#xD;
      focus of several fMRI studies, most probably as a result of its innervations of key cortical&#xD;
      and sub-cortical regions implicated in motor and neurocognitive functions, in addition to its&#xD;
      implication in a range of psychiatric and neurological conditions. Early pharmacological fMRI&#xD;
      studies suggest that this is a tool sensitive enough to pick up pharmacologically modulated&#xD;
      activations in the brain. Pharmacological fMRI has a potential for testing transmitter models&#xD;
      of disorder, predicting treatment response and supporting the development of novel compounds&#xD;
      in neuropsychiatry.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective of this study is to investigate if the activation signature of a typical&#xD;
      antipsychotic agent is dissociable from a new drug with a pharmacological profile that&#xD;
      differs from both typical and the atypical antipsychotics since it is a potent partial D2&#xD;
      agonist. For this purpose we will employ fMRI paradigms based on findings from previous&#xD;
      research on animals and humans described above.&#xD;
