      The main objective of the study is to observe the OXN treatment of patients with moderate to&#xD;
      severe non-malignant pain in daily clinical practise with respect to pain relief and bowel&#xD;
      function. Patients who have insufficient pain relief and/or unacceptable side effects with&#xD;
      the previous analgesic treatment WHO step 1 or 2 and require around-the-clock opioid therapy&#xD;
      can be included in the study.&#xD;

      Patients will receive OXN for 3 weeks in the first phase (core phase) and in the second phase&#xD;
      (extension phase) they will receive OXN as is daily clinical practice until reimbursement of&#xD;
      OXN in the Netherlands or until discontinuation on request of the patient.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Male or female patients at least 18 years or older with moderate to severe&#xD;
             non-malignant pain who are willing to provide written informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Females less than one year post-menopausal must have a negative urine pregnancy test&#xD;
             recorded at the screening visit, be non-lactating, and willing to use adequate and&#xD;
             reliable contraception throughout the study. Highly effective methods of birth control&#xD;
             are defined as those which result in a low failure rate (i.e. less than 1% per year)&#xD;
             when used consistently and correctly such as sterilisation, implants, injectables,&#xD;
             combined oral contraceptives, some IUDs (Intrauterine Device, hormonal), sexual&#xD;
             abstinence or vasectomised partner.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Patients with documented history of moderate to severe, non-malignant pain treated&#xD;
             with WHO step I or II analgesics with insufficient pain relief and/or unacceptable&#xD;
             side effects that requires around-the-clock opioid therapy (starting dose of oxycodone&#xD;
             over 20 mg/day) and are likely to benefit from WHO step III opioid therapy for the&#xD;
             duration of the study. Patients must be willing to discontinue their current&#xD;
             analgesics (opioids and co-analgesics like anti-depressants and anti-epileptics).&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Patients are willing to discontinue pre study laxative medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Patients taking daily fibre supplementation or bulking agents are eligible if they can&#xD;
             be maintained on a stable dose and regimen throughout the study, and in the&#xD;
             investigators opinion are willing and able to maintain adequate hydration.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Patients willing and able to participate in all aspects of the study, including use of&#xD;
             medication, completion of subjective evaluations, attending scheduled clinic visits,&#xD;
             completing telephone contacts, and compliance with protocol requirements as evidenced&#xD;
             by providing written, informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Any history of hypersensitivity to oxycodone, naloxone, related products, and other&#xD;
             ingredients.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Patients that require a dose over 20 mg/day oxycodone at the start of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Active alcohol or drug abuse and/or history of opioid abuse.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Evidence of clinically significant cardiovascular, renal, hepatic, or psychiatric&#xD;
             disease, as determined by medical history, clinical laboratory tests, ECG results, and&#xD;
             physical examination, that would place the patient at risk upon exposure to the study&#xD;
             medication or that may confound the analysis and/or interpretation of the study&#xD;
             results.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. In the investigator's opinion, patients who are receiving hypnotics or other central&#xD;
             nervous system (CNS) depressants that may pose a risk of additional CNS depression&#xD;
             with opioid study medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Patients receiving opioid substitution therapy for opioid addiction (e.g., methadone&#xD;
             or buprenorphine).&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Patients with uncontrolled seizures or convulsive disorder.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Patients who have a confirmed diagnosis of ongoing irritable bowel syndrome.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Patients with evidence of clinically significant gastrointestinal disease (e.g.&#xD;
             paralytic ileus, peritoneal carcinosis), significant structural abnormalities of the&#xD;
             gastrointestinal tract (e.g. scarring, obstruction etc).&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Patients who participated in a clinical research study involving a new chemical entity&#xD;
             or an experimental drug within 30 days of study entry.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Surgery completed prior to the start of the study, or planned surgery during the study&#xD;
             that would influence pain or bowel function during the study or preclude completion of&#xD;
             the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Patients presently taking, or who have taken, naloxone &lt;30 days prior to the start of&#xD;
             the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. Patients suffering from diarrhoea and/or opioid withdrawal.&#xD;
&#xD;
         14. Patients with any situation in which opioids are contra-indicated, severe respiratory&#xD;
             depression with hypoxia and/or hypercapnia, severe obstructive pulmonary disease, cor&#xD;
             pulmonale, severe bronchial asthma, paralytic ileus.&#xD;
&#xD;
         15. Patients with myxodema, hypothyroidism, Addisons disease, increase of intracranial&#xD;
             pressure and/or epilepsy (see also exclusion criteria 7).&#xD;
