      Objective: This research agreement brings together French and Canadian teams of scientists,&#xD;
      HIV testing centers and community based partners. The aim is to explore the feasibility and&#xD;
      limitations of offering community based rapid HIV testing to men who have sex with men (MSM).&#xD;

      Background: Studies have shown that knowing one's own HIV positive status, may lead to a&#xD;
      reduction in sexual risk behaviours. The introduction of new forms of rapid HIV testing in&#xD;
      urban areas, may be of benefit to the public health sector, notably in identifying primary&#xD;
      HIV infection, preventing secondary HIV transmission and decreasing the spread of HIV&#xD;
      infection. Studies have also shown that rapid HIV testing, which yields same-day results,&#xD;
      enables a greater number of individuals in populations at risk to become aware of their HIV&#xD;
      status.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Issue: The working hypothesis is that the current screening system is not sufficiently&#xD;
      suitable for MSM. A community-based rapid HIV testing program could better target the high&#xD;
      risk MSM population and shorten the delay between risky behaviour and HIV testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: This intervention could enable the assessment of the feasibility of community-based&#xD;
      rapid HIV testing. Moreover it could compare traditional CDAG (Free Anonymous Screening&#xD;
      Consultation or Centre de dépistage anonyme et gratuit in French) center testing with&#xD;
      community-based rapid testing. A pre-study phase is first realised to characterize those in&#xD;
      the MSM population undergoing HIV testing, before promoting and then beginning the survey.&#xD;
      During the normal opening hours of five testing centers, clients will be randomized to have a&#xD;
      rapid finger-stick blood specimen test or a conventional test. During evenings and week-ends&#xD;
      (i.e. when the centers are closed) only community based rapid HIV testing will be proposed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Schedule: The pre-study phase is planned for the first quarter of 2009. Promotion of the&#xD;
      survey will begin one month before the experimental study which in turn will start in the&#xD;
      third quarter of 2009 and will run for 7 months. The end of data analyses is planned for the&#xD;
      end of 2010.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome: We will compare HIV population exposure, screening history and the frequency of&#xD;
      primary HIV infection diagnosis. We expect to find that those MSM who undergo community based&#xD;
      HIV testing during evenings or week-ends, is a population who take repeated sexual risks and&#xD;
      who have repeated HIV testing. We also expect to find that this form of testing will be&#xD;
      characterized in terms of satisfaction as non-inferior compared to the classic one. In the&#xD;
      long term, and if the results are confirmed, rapid HIV testing could be extended to strictly&#xD;
      community-based sites.&#xD;
