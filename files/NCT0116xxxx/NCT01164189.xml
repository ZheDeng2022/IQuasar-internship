      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as temozolomide, work in different ways to stop&#xD;
      the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing.&#xD;
      Monoclonal antibodies, such as bevacizumab, can block tumor growth in different ways. Some&#xD;
      block the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Others find tumor cells and help kill&#xD;
      them or carry tumor-killing substances to them. It is not yet known whether temozolomide is&#xD;
      more effective when given with or without bevacizumab in treating patients with recurrent&#xD;
      glioma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE: This randomized clinical trial is studying how well temozolomide works with or&#xD;
      without bevacizumab in treating patients with recurrent glioma.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To document the activity of both combination temozolomide plus bevacizumab and&#xD;
           temozolomide alone in patients with recurrent grade II or grade III glioma without&#xD;
           1p/19q co-deletion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To characterize the safety of treatment in these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To document the quality of life and cognitive functioning, as a measure of clinical&#xD;
           benefit, of these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To explore qualification or occurrence of prognostic and/or predictive biomarkers of&#xD;
           activity or efficacy in these patients. (exploratory)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To document the discordances between RANO and Macdonald's criteria for the evaluation of&#xD;
           response and progression. (exploratory)&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to institution,&#xD;
      initial histology (grade II vs grade III), WHO performance status (0-1 vs 2), and prior&#xD;
      treatment (radiotherapy [RT] alone, temozolomide [TMZ] or procarbazine, lomustine and&#xD;
      vincristine [PCV] alone vs TMZ/RT). Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Arm I: Patients receive oral temozolomide once daily on days 1-5. Treatment repeats&#xD;
           every 28 days for 12 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable&#xD;
           toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Arm II: Patients receive oral temozolomide as in arm I and bevacizumab IV over 90&#xD;
           minutes on days 1 and 15. Treatment repeats every 28 days for 12 courses in the absence&#xD;
           of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients complete neurocognitive questionnaires (i.e., the Hopkins Verbal Learning test, the&#xD;
      Controlled Oral Word Association test, and the Trail Making tests A and B). Quality-of-life&#xD;
      assessment questionnaires, including EORTC QLQ-C30 and EORTC-BN20, are completed by both&#xD;
      patients and caregivers/relatives at baseline and then periodically.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Frozen tumor biopsies or paraffin blocks and blood specimens are collected for bio-banking&#xD;
      and translational research.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed up every 3 months.&#xD;

                  spermicides) to prevent pregnancy, or are practicing abstinence or where their&#xD;
                  partner is sterile (eg, vasectomy) should be considered to be of childbearing&#xD;
                  potential.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Women of child bearing potential must have a negative serum or urine pregnancy&#xD;
                  test (minimum sensitivity 25 IU/L or equivalent units of HCG) within 72 hours&#xD;
                  prior to the start of investigational product.&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Before patient randomization and study related procedures (that would not have been&#xD;
             performed as part as standard care), written informed consent must be given according&#xD;
             to ICH/GCP, and national/local regulations. Informed consent should also be given for&#xD;
             biological material to be stored and used for future research on brain tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  All indicated timelines and absolute values requested by the eligibility criteria must&#xD;
             be adhered to. However, a maximum of +/- 10% of the reference value for laboratory&#xD;
             parameters and a maximum of +/- 2 days for timelines may be acceptable. Discussion&#xD;
             with Headquarters and study coordinator is encouraged.&#xD;
