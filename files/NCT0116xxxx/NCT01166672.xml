      The purpose of this study is to establish feasiblity of recruiting obese breast cancer&#xD;
      survivors at the end of treatment, getting those survivors to lose weight and attend&#xD;
      follow-up visits for 6 months.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Breast cancer related lymphedema occurs in 20-30% of survivors. Weight loss could prevent&#xD;
      onset. We seek to do a pilot study to establish feasibility of 1) recruiting survivors at&#xD;
      risk for lymphedema to do a weight loss intervention, 2) achieving 10-15% weight loss over 26&#xD;
      weeks in this population, and 3) attendance at follow-up visits 6 months.&#xD;
