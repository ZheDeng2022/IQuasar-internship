      This study will randomly allocate 180 women undergoing elective C-sections under combined&#xD;
      spinal epidural (CSE) Anesthesia at BC Women's Hospital to one of three groups: Standard&#xD;
      Pillow under Head (Control), Head Elevated in Ramped Position immediately after regional&#xD;
      anesthesia (HERP), or Head Elevated Ramped Position horizontally- Horizontal until&#xD;
      establishment of anesthesia and then head elevated for the surgical procedure (HERP-H). The&#xD;
      subjects will be monitored for blood pressure changes (hypotension), comfort levels and time&#xD;
      to adequate level of the anesthetic block obtained with the CSE. The study will determine if&#xD;
      positioning a parturient in the ramped position using an elevation pillow will significantly&#xD;
      increase the time for anesthesia to reach the dermatome level of T4 as well as whether it&#xD;
      increases maternal comfort and provides a better airway position for the parturient.&#xD;

      The majority of elective and emergency cesarean deliveries are done under neuraxial&#xD;
      anesthesia (spinal, epidural, combined spinal epidural) where the nerves to the lower half of&#xD;
      the body are anesthetised with local anesthetic injected into the spine by the&#xD;
      anesthesiologist. The injection is done at a low level in the spine and the local anesthetic&#xD;
      rises within the cerebrospinal fluid to &quot;block&quot; or &quot;freeze&quot; higher nerves. The maximum level&#xD;
      of sensory block anesthesia is determined by the cephalad distribution of the local&#xD;
      anesthetic in the CSF, the total dose administered and uptake by neuronal tissue. The height&#xD;
      of block is important to ensure that the woman is comfortable during cesarean delivery;&#xD;
      generally a loss of cold sensation to ice at the dermatome level of T4 (the level of the&#xD;
      nipples) is considered appropriate to commence surgery. If the block is below the level of&#xD;
      T4, the woman is likely to feel discomfort and potentially pain, whereas too high a level can&#xD;
      result in hemodynamic instability and difficulty breathing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Conventionally patients are positioned on the operating table for surgery in a flat or&#xD;
      horizontal (supine) position with a pillow under the head and a wedge positioned under the&#xD;
      right hip to prevent aortocaval compression. Many women find lying completely flat while&#xD;
      awake very uncomfortable and it is not uncommon for them to request that the head of the bed&#xD;
      be elevated for comfort.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Difficult or failed intubation in obstetrics has been responsible for a number of maternal&#xD;
      deaths over the years. The incidence of failed intubation is approximately 1 in 280 in the&#xD;
      obstetric population compared to 1 in 2230 in the general surgical population. This is the&#xD;
      result of a number of factors, including increased airway swelling due to progesterone.&#xD;
      However, much of the perceived difficulty is due to anatomical factors such as increased&#xD;
      breast size obstructing the levering hand when trying to insert the laryngoscope into the&#xD;
      anesthetised patient's mouth. There have been numerous reports of similar problems with&#xD;
      intubating the airway in bariatric (obese) parturients but recently the myth of obesity&#xD;
      causing a difficult airway has been debunked providing the patient is positioned properly.&#xD;
      Correct positioning of the patient in a &quot;ramped&quot; position with the patients head clearly&#xD;
      elevated above their shoulders improves laryngeal exposure in obese patients. Collins et al.&#xD;
      showed that &quot;ramping&quot; the patient until there was horizontal alignment between the external&#xD;
      auditory meatus and sternal notch improved the laryngeal view when compared to the standard&#xD;
      &quot;sniff&quot; position. Other benefits of the &quot;ramped&quot; position include better pre-oxygenation and&#xD;
      bag mask ventilation in the 25 degree head up position than in the supine position in the&#xD;
      severely obese patient. Studies in term parturients have shown an increase in the functional&#xD;
      residual capacity (FRC) and slower desaturation rates in the head up position compared to the&#xD;
      supine position. Some parturients require general anesthesia and endotracheal intubation for&#xD;
      caesarean delivery. This may be due to the urgency of the situation, failure of neuraxial&#xD;
      anesthesia or due to prolonged, difficult surgery. Having the woman adequately positioned for&#xD;
      possible induction of general anesthesia, even though she is having a neuraxial technique,&#xD;
      would be ideal and perhaps safer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The ramped position can be achieved a number of ways including folded blankets stacked under&#xD;
      the patient's body, neck and head. Most operating tables can be manipulated using the&#xD;
      electronic or manual controls into a back/trunk up position. Commercial devices have been&#xD;
      designed including the TROOPÂ® elevation pillow, designed by an American bariatric&#xD;
      anesthesiologist Dr Craig Troop. It is a plastic covered foam pillow with an elevation angle&#xD;
      of 20 degrees which can simply be placed on the operating table. For the purposes of&#xD;
      standardization we will be using the TROOP pillow as a means of achieving head elevation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Taking these factors into consideration it would seem sensible to head elevate the parturient&#xD;
      when positioned on the operating table. However, as the majority of obstetric surgeries are&#xD;
      done under neuraxial anesthesia with only 1% undergoing general anesthesia in the elective&#xD;
      situation and 3% in the emergency situation, the concern is that the position may result in a&#xD;
      slower rise of the anesthetic block thereby delaying the start of surgery. The factors&#xD;
      affecting the level of the anesthetic block are variable; gravity may play a part and the&#xD;
      action of raising the head of parturient might logically result in a slower rise of&#xD;
      anesthetic block resulting in an inadequate level for surgery, particularly with the commonly&#xD;
      used hyperbaric local anesthetic. However, there is a large variability in patients and&#xD;
      factors including dural sac compression from epidural venous plexus engorgement secondary to&#xD;
      a degree of venal caval compression in the supine wedged position which may push the local&#xD;
      anesthetic in a cephalad direction, and this may play a more significant role than simple&#xD;
      gravity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The effect of the ramped positioning on the level of spinal anesthesia has not been studied.&#xD;
      Much of the work has been to look at the effects of lateral versus sitting posture for&#xD;
      insertion of the spinal anesthetic on rise of block and hemodynamic stability. These studies&#xD;
      showed a slower onset of anesthesia in the sitting group versus lateral with conflicting&#xD;
      results in reduction in hypotension. The slower rise may be beneficial in preventing&#xD;
      hemodynamic instability. Mardirosoff et al., when looking at the effects of sensory block&#xD;
      extension during CSE in non obstetric patients, showed no significant change in block level&#xD;
      when patients were sitting for 5 minutes following subarachnoid anesthesia; the mean level of&#xD;
      block in all groups was to T4.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As there is no strong evidence either to support or oppose the rise of block against gravity,&#xD;
      we will be doing a CSE anesthetic so that should the spinal block not rise to a sufficient&#xD;
      level in any of the groups we will be able to supplement the block with local anesthetic&#xD;
      injected into the epidural space to help raise the block by epidural volume expansion and/or&#xD;
      by local anesthesia of the spinal nerves in the epidural space.&#xD;

             Obesity can result in increased venal caval compression in the supine wedge position&#xD;
             causing epidural venous plexus engorgement and dural sac compression which may result&#xD;
             in a high block. A later study will look at the effects of positioning in the obese&#xD;

          -  Uterine over distension- polyhydramnios, twin pregnancy and estimated fetal weight of&#xD;
             over 4kg by ultrasound scan -Uterine over distension can result in increased&#xD;
             aortocaval compression which may lead to engorgement of the epidural venous plexus and&#xD;
             dural sac compression which may result in a high block.&#xD;
