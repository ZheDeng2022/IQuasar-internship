  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The ORBIT-AF registry will be a multicenter, prospective outpatient disease registry to&#xD;
      identify &quot;real world&quot; treatment patterns of atrial fibrillation. The registry will describe&#xD;
      this patient population with regards to demographics, clinical factors, risk stratification,&#xD;
      and geographic regions. In particular, attention will be focused on the utilization,&#xD;
      effectiveness, and safety of antithrombotic therapies in the prevention of stroke. The&#xD;
      registry is designed to identify reasons and risk factors for non-receipt of anticoagulation&#xD;
      (AC) therapy, as well as reasons why AF patients who are prescribed AC therapy do not take&#xD;
      them.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The ORBIT-AF registry is a multicenter prospective outpatient disease registry of patients&#xD;
      with incident (initial diagnosis) or prevalent (existing diagnosis) atrial fibrillation (AF)&#xD;
      that will analyze treatment patterns and outcomes in patients with AF in the US.&#xD;
      Approximately 10,000 prospective cohort of patients will be enrolled. The registry will be a&#xD;
      nation-wide collaboration of Health Care Providers (e.g., cardiologists, internists, primary&#xD;
      care physicians, electrophysiologists, quality improvement personnel, office/practice&#xD;
      managers, research coordinators, and pharmacists). This collaborative effort will be focused&#xD;
      on the optimization of outpatient management of patients with AF. Consecutive patients who&#xD;
      meet the eligibility criteria will be approached and educated about the registry. Patients&#xD;
      who express interest will provide informed consent. Patients enrolled in the registry will be&#xD;
      followed for approximately 3 years. Patient follow-up by their AF care provider will continue&#xD;
      as scheduled according to local clinical practice. Patient Reported outcome (PRO)&#xD;
      questionnaires will be administered to a sub-sample of approximately 1,500 patients. For&#xD;
      patients who consent to answer PRO questionnaires, these questionnaires will be administered&#xD;
      by the site to the patient at the baseline visit [except the baseline Anticoagulation-Related&#xD;
      Treatment Satisfaction (ACTS)] and during their regularly scheduled follow-up visits. The&#xD;
      baseline ACTS for incident patients will be completed and returned back to the site at least&#xD;
      4 weeks after starting antithrombotic therapies. The ACTS questionnaire will only be&#xD;
      administered to patients who are taking antithrombotic therapies within the 4 weeks before a&#xD;
      visit or newly prescribed antithrombotic therapies. Data collection will occur at 6-month&#xD;
      intervals for a minimum of 3 years (baseline, 6 months, 12 months, 18 months, 24 months, 30&#xD;
      months, and 36 months). The data collection windows will be wide (3 months in either&#xD;
      direction) in order to maximize data collection during the patients regularly scheduled&#xD;
      follow-up with their AF care provider. Collection of Patient Reported Outcome (PRO)&#xD;
      Questionnaires will not continue beyond the 24-month data collection interval. Atrial&#xD;
      Fibrillation Data capture will include demographics, cardiovascular risk factors, diagnosis,&#xD;
      type of AF (paroxysmal, persistent, permanent AF), treatment strategy (rate vs. rhythm),&#xD;
      ablation history, cardioversions, antithrombotic therapy decisions and monitoring (INRs),&#xD;
      concomitant medications and doses, insurance and provider information, AF quality-of-life,&#xD;
      anticoagulation treatment satisfaction, caregiver assistance, pet ownership, comorbidities,&#xD;
      compliance, and outcomes. Pre-defined outcomes of interest will include stroke or non-CNS&#xD;
      (non-systemic) embolism, major adverse cardiac events, all-cause mortality, cause-specific&#xD;
      death (sudden, non-sudden, heart failure-related), major bleeding, AF-related quality of&#xD;
      life, anticoagulation-related treatment satisfaction, all-cause hospitalization and specific&#xD;
      anticoagulation outcomes (e.g. time in therapeutic range and primary discontinuation of oral&#xD;
      anticoagulation). The data generated by this registry will be used to identify real world&#xD;
      practice, especially as it compares and relates to guidelines set forth by the American&#xD;
      College of Cardiology, American Heart Association and European Society of Cardiology for the&#xD;
      management of patients with AF. Observational Study - No investigational drug administered.&#xD;
      For any patients receiving the sponsor's drug, Xarelto (rivaroxaban), under the direction of&#xD;
      a physician, all serious adverse events and all non-serious related events will be reported&#xD;
      to the sponsor (Janssen Scientific Affairs, LLC)&#xD;
