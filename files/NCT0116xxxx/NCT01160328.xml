  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The male sex hormone, testosterone, plays an important role in determining body fat&#xD;
      distribution in men. This is especially evident in the dramatic shift in body composition as&#xD;
      boys and girls reach sexual maturity. Normal weight women have twice the body fat of a normal&#xD;
      weight man (30% vs. 15% on average) and men will have twice the stomach fat as women (10% vs.&#xD;
      5% of fat as intra-abdominal, men vs. women). These are likely sex-steroid linked events.&#xD;
      Short and long term changes in regional fat distribution accompany testosterone deficiency&#xD;
      and can be reversed by testosterone replacement. Testosterone deficient men have increased&#xD;
      stomach fat that can be reversed with testosterone replacement therapy. Interestingly, the&#xD;
      mechanism by which testosterone affects where we store fat is unknown. It is important to&#xD;
      understand how testosterone influences where we store fat as it is well established that&#xD;
      increased stomach fat results in elevated disease risk.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed study aims to examine the effect of short term, temporary testosterone decreases&#xD;
      on how and where men store fat. The investigators will compare fat storage between men given&#xD;
      Lupron to temporarily decrease testosterone levels those that receive Lupron plus&#xD;
      testosterone replacement vs. a no treatment control group. Comparing these three groups will&#xD;
      allow us to understand the effects of testosterone on short-term changes in fat tissue&#xD;
      function that lead to the long-term changes in where we store body fat.&#xD;

      There are 3 groups to which you might be assigned. Assignment to these groups is random (ie.&#xD;
      by flip of a coin).&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are assigned toâ€¦&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group 1 - you will receive no treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group 2 - you will be given an injection of leuprolide acetate (Lupron) which will&#xD;
           temporarily lower sex hormones. This injection will be given two times during the 7 week&#xD;
           treatment period.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group 3 - you will be given the injections of Lupron but after the second injection, you&#xD;
           will also be required to apply a testosterone gel that will result in maintenance of&#xD;
           your testosterone levels. The testosterone gel is rubbed on the upper shoulders, similar&#xD;
           to putting on suntan lotion. You will be shown how to put this on.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are in group 2 or 3 you will be given testosterone gel, a male hormone, at the end of&#xD;
      the study to help prevent symptoms such as hot flashes, until your body has time to return to&#xD;
      its pre-study hormone levels. This can take up to 4 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to the treatment period, you will also:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If you are in group 1, have 4 fat biopsies that are like a miniature liposuction. The&#xD;
           investigators numb the skin before doing the biopsies. If you are in group 2 or 3, you&#xD;
           will also have 1 muscle biopsy at the end of the treatment period. In addition, if you&#xD;
           are in group 2 or 3, you will also have a fat and muscle biopsy before you start the&#xD;
           hormone treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  All groups will need to spend two days and nights in the Clinical Research Unit of the&#xD;
           Mayo Clinic and your meals will be provided by the for 5 days beforehand. You will also&#xD;
           need to spend one morning undergoing some initial tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have your body fat measured before and after the hormone treatment using x-ray&#xD;
           like equipment that will expose you to some radiation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Our measures of fat metabolism use molecules that have a small amount of radioactivity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Remuneration is provided.&#xD;
