      Specific Aims and Hypotheses:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1: To test the effect of the &quot;Trial of Ascertaining Individual preferences for Loved&#xD;
      Ones' Role in End-of-life Decisions&quot; (TAILORED) Intervention on family decision-making&#xD;
      self-efficacy at 8 weeks both with respect to the patient's present situation and in a&#xD;
      hypothetical situation in which the patient lacks decision-making capacity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypotheses 1a: Family decision-making self-efficacy will be greater at 8 weeks in pairs that&#xD;
      have undergone the TAILORED Intervention than in pairs receiving the standard information on&#xD;
      advance directives in the patient's present situation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypotheses 1b: Family decision-making self-efficacy will be greater at 8 weeks in pairs that&#xD;
      have undergone the TAILORED Intervention than in pairs receiving the standard information on&#xD;
      advance directives in the hypothetical situation in which the patient lacks decision making&#xD;
      capacity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2: To test the effect of the TAILORED Intervention on family psychological outcomes&#xD;
      (depression, caregiver burden, decision making distress).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypotheses 2a: Depression will be less at 8 weeks in family members who have undergone the&#xD;
      TAILORED Intervention than in family members who have received the standard information on&#xD;
      advance directives.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypotheses 2b: Caregiver burden will be less at 8 weeks in family members who have undergone&#xD;
      the TAILORED Intervention than in family members who have received the standard information&#xD;
      on advance directives.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypotheses 2c: Decision-making distress will be less at 8 weeks in family members who have&#xD;
      undergone the TAILORED Intervention than in family members who have received the standard&#xD;
      information on advance directives.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 3: To test the effect of the TAILORED Intervention on patient and family satisfaction&#xD;
      with family decision-making involvement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 3a: Patient satisfaction with family decision involvement will be greater at 8&#xD;
      weeks in patients who have undergone the TAILORED Intervention than in patients receiving the&#xD;
      standard information on advance directives.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 3b: Family member satisfaction with decision involvement will be greater at 8&#xD;
      weeks in family members who have undergone the TAILORED Intervention than in family members&#xD;
      receiving the standard information on advance directives.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 4: To explore family decision-making self-efficacy and perceptions of the TAILORED&#xD;
      Intervention.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Enhanced patient-family health care decision making is essential to improving the overall&#xD;
      quality of end-of-life care (NIH State of the Science Conference Statement on Improving&#xD;
      End-of-Life Care, 2004). Although most terminally ill patients desire shared family decision&#xD;
      making, few family members are prepared for this and many report high levels of distress, and&#xD;
      even the inability to make such decisions (Nolan, et al., 2005). Factors positively&#xD;
      influencing the surrogates are: 1) previous experience with surrogate decision making, 2)&#xD;
      knowing the patient's preferences, and 3) receiving positive reinforcement about decision&#xD;
      making. The last two are amenable to change in &quot;Trial of Ascertaining Individual preferences&#xD;
      for Loved Ones' Role in End-of-life Decisions&quot; (the &quot;TAILORED&quot; study). The TAILORED&#xD;
      intervention is a simple clinic- based protocol involving an assessment of the confidence&#xD;
      (self-efficacy) of family members for making health care decisions with or for a terminally&#xD;
      ill loved one. Clinicians then tailor their guidance to patients and families about issues to&#xD;
      discuss at home to better prepare family members for the desired decision-making role. This&#xD;
      randomized clinical trial will include 132 patient-family dyads from two diagnostic groups: a&#xD;
      group expected to retain (amyotrophic lateral sclerosis) or lose decisional capacity&#xD;
      (advanced gastro-intestinal malignancy). A nurse will deliver the TAILORED intervention in&#xD;
      the clinic at baseline and will call the family member in 4- weeks to encourage ongoing&#xD;
      patient-family discussion. Outcomes will be assessed at 8-weeks. A subgroup of family members&#xD;
      whose loved one has died will be interviewed in-depth about their end-of-life decision making&#xD;
      and the impact of the TAILORED Intervention. Aim 1: To test the effect of the TAILORED&#xD;
      intervention on family decision-making self-efficacy at 8 weeks both with respect to the&#xD;
      patient's present situation and in a hypothetical situation in which the patient lacks&#xD;
      decision-making capacity. Aim 2: To test the effect of the TAILORED intervention on family&#xD;
      psychological outcomes (depression, caregiver burden, decision making distress). Aim 3: To&#xD;
      test the effect of the TAILORED intervention on patient and family satisfaction with family&#xD;
      decision-making involvement. Aim 4: To explore family decision-making self-efficacy and&#xD;
      perceptions of the TAILORED intervention. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Although most terminally&#xD;
      ill patients prefer to share health care decision making with family and want family to make&#xD;
      decisions for them if they are too ill to do so, few family members are prepared for this&#xD;
      role and many report high levels of distress and even the inability to make such decisions.&#xD;
      &quot;Trial of Ascertaining Individual preferences for Loved Ones' Role in End-of-life Decisions&quot;&#xD;
      (the &quot;TAILORED&quot; study) tests a simple clinic-based protocol that allows clinicians to assess&#xD;
      the confidence (self-efficacy) of family members for making health care decisions with or for&#xD;
      a terminally ill loved one. Clinicians then tailor their guidance to patients and families&#xD;
      about what issues to discuss to better prepare family members for the decision making role&#xD;
      desired by the patient.&#xD;
