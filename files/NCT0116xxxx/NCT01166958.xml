  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Current osteoporosis therapies produce a prompt increase in bone mass, followed by only&#xD;
      modest or no further subsequent gains. This limitation, known as the &quot;remodeling transient,&quot;&#xD;
      reflects the &quot;coupling&quot; of bone resorption with formation such that interventions impacting&#xD;
      either of these processes lead to compensatory changes of the other. For example, medications&#xD;
      which increase bone formation promptly also stimulate bone resorption. Thus, given the need&#xD;
      to dramatically increase bone mass in patients with osteoporosis, it is necessary to&#xD;
      &quot;uncouple&quot; formation and resorption. The investigators believe this to be possible using&#xD;
      currently existing FDA-approved therapeutic agents, by using a novel, sequential approach.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This pilot project will obtain preliminary data essential to support future work. In this&#xD;
      study, the investigators will begin to explore the use of sequential anabolic treatment with&#xD;
      teriparatide followed by antiresorptive therapy with raloxifene. The investigators propose&#xD;
      that such sequential treatment will allow opening of the &quot;anabolic window,&quot; the brief period&#xD;
      of time following initiation of teriparatide therapy in which bone formation exceeds&#xD;
      resorption.&#xD;
