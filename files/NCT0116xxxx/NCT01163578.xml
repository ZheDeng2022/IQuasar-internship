  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to evaluate whether certain proteins, expressed in biological&#xD;
      tissues can indict a better understanding of the effect of drugs that are used to treat&#xD;
      rejection, and of processes leading to rejection and rejection-free outcomes.&#xD;

      All transplant recipients receive periodic monitoring of drug levels and laboratory tests to&#xD;
      assess adequacy of immunosuppression and allograft function. These are performed when the&#xD;
      recipient is admitted to the hospital after transplantation or for a complication such as&#xD;
      acute rejection or toxicity, or when the recipient is an outpatient.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Blood samples: Participants may be asked to provide research blood specimens during&#xD;
           regular clinical tests, and may collect up to 15 milliliters of blood as many as 7 times&#xD;
           within the first year of transplant, and then less often thereafter. The total volume&#xD;
           collected will take in account the patient's height, weight and age at the time of the&#xD;
           collection. However, if for any reason participant is unable to provide a sample during&#xD;
           regular clinical test it may be collected at another time. Participants will be asked to&#xD;
           provide these samples indefinitely. This will allow longitudinal assessment of the&#xD;
           stability of biomarker expression as a reflection of clinical drug concentrations in&#xD;
           repeated measurements.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Saliva collection: Up to 5 ml of the subject's saliva will be collected no more than&#xD;
           four times, if the previous sample does not provide adequate information. Samples will&#xD;
           be collected in self-collection container at the time of consent or as early as possible&#xD;
           after consents are obtained, and will be stored at room temperature in the Pediatric&#xD;
           Transplantation Laboratory, 3344 Forbes Ave. In recipients where both are available, the&#xD;
           genotyping results as DNA from saliva will be compared between paired blood samples.&#xD;
           Henceforth, saliva collection will only be offered to participants who cannot donate&#xD;
           blood specimens for genotyping. Salivary sampling is considered an acceptable&#xD;
           alternative standard for whole blood genotyping. A saliva sample will be collected only&#xD;
           if the patient or the patient's parent or guardian prefers this option over blood&#xD;
           sampling.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Collection of urine, feces, and bile: five mls of any body fluid will be collected in&#xD;
           sterile urine cups for application of proteomics technologies. Collections may be&#xD;
           repeated up to four times, if the first specimen provides suboptimal information.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Collection of remaining allograft standard of care biopsy specimens, and tissue from&#xD;
           explants: Any piece of allograft biopsy deemed residual by the pathologist will be&#xD;
           subjected to gene array testing. This will occur when participant is scheduled for their&#xD;
           standard of care biopsy, or while in surgery. Genetic material extracted from the&#xD;
           smallest tissue can be amplified using several approaches.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Measurements: Biomarker expression will be evaluated after mitogen and antigen&#xD;
           stimulation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells. (1-3). Briefly, peripheral blood&#xD;
           mononuclear cells (PBMC) are extracted from whole blood by Ficoll gradient separation,&#xD;
           Thereafter, either mitogens such as phytohemaglutinin, pokeweed mitogen, or&#xD;
           phorbol-myristic acid-ionomycin, or viral and major histocompatibility complex (MHC)&#xD;
           peptide antigens, or intact alloantigenic cells will be used to stimulate recipient&#xD;
           PBMC. Cellular responses that can be measured include but are not limited to expressed&#xD;
           pro-inflammatory or anti-inflammatory markers, cytokines, proliferation, cytotoxicity,&#xD;
           and apoptosis.&#xD;
