  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This prospective study was conducted to explore clinical characteristics and outcomes of&#xD;
      patients diagnosed with pulmonary sarcoidosis and PH. The investigators also assessed the&#xD;
      role of D -dimer levels in these population.&#xD;

      The investigation will be approving by the Ethics Committee of Meir medical center.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We retrospectively will review the medical records of 100 sarcoidosis patients seen in our&#xD;
      outpatient pulmonary clinics of Meir medical center, between July 2009 and May 2010.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All the patients will prospectively invite to our pulmonary outpatients clinic at Meir&#xD;
      medical center.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sarcoidosis will be diagnosed based on the latest American Thoracic Society (ATS), European&#xD;
      Respiratory Society (ERS) and World Association of Sarcoidosis and Other Granulomatous&#xD;
      Disorders (WASOG) criteria. (6, 7) Each patient will undergo two-dimensional&#xD;
      echocardiographic data, complete pulmonary function test results including spirometry, lung&#xD;
      volume, CO diffusion capacity and 6-min walk test (6MWT) data and D-dimer assay during their&#xD;
      visiting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will be collecting including patient demographics, symptoms, details of comorbid&#xD;
      illnesses, sarcoidosis stage using the modified Scadding (8) classification system to stage&#xD;
      chest radiography (CXR) findings and treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pulmonary function tests included spirometry and lung volume measurement by body&#xD;
      plethysmography, performed according to the recommendations of the American Thoracic Society.&#xD;
      (9) The 6MWT was conducted in accordance with ATS guidelines. (10) All patients exhibited&#xD;
      resting oxygen saturation (SpO 2 ) the &gt; 88% at the beginning of the walk test and Borg&#xD;
      dyspnea index (11) will be record at the beginning and end of the 6-min walk.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All Computed tomography (CT) findings of the patients will be assess for the presence of the&#xD;
      following recognized CT patterns (12): (1) mediastinal and/or hilar lymph node enlargement;&#xD;
      (2) ground-glass opacity; (3) consolidation; (4) nodules &lt;3 cm in diameter; (5) thickening of&#xD;
      bronchovascular bundles; (6) linear opacity, including interlobular septal lines and&#xD;
      interstitial thickening and (7) features indicating scarring and fibrosis (grouped together)&#xD;
      that included traction bronchiectasis, honeycombing, cysts and/or volume loss.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, all CT will be review for findings that are known as a signs of PH including the&#xD;
      pulmonary trunk diameter, right and left pulmonary arteries diameters and the pulmonary to&#xD;
      aortic diameters ratio.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The radiologist will be blinded to the echocardiological data as well as to the pulmonary&#xD;
      function data and D-dimer levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Diagnosis of PH was based on Doppler echocardiography and defined as an estimated right&#xD;
      ventricular systolic pressure (RVSP) of the &gt; 40 mm Hg in the absence of left ventricular&#xD;
      dysfunction (i.e., an ejection fraction under 50%), ischemic heart disease (manifested by&#xD;
      regional wall motion abnormalities) or valvular heart disease. Right ventricular systolic&#xD;
      pressure was estimated based on the modified Bernoulli equation (13) RVSP = transtricuspid&#xD;
      gradient + right atrial pressure (RAP), where transtricuspid gradient is 4v2 (v = peak&#xD;
      velocity of tricuspid regurgitation in meter per second) and RAP was estimated to be 5, 10&#xD;
      All the patients will undergo a D-dimer assay in the same day of the pulmonary function tests&#xD;
      and Echo evaluations.&#xD;
