  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study seeks to investigate the role of pimecrolimus in restoring disturbed skin barrier&#xD;
      function and reversing epidermal abnormalities found in atopic dermatitis (AD). The project&#xD;
      is based on findings the investigators presented at the recent SID meeting in Providence and&#xD;
      published in the J Invest Dermatol (122: 1423-31, 2004). The investigators research shows&#xD;
      that AD is characterized by impaired skin barrier function, reduced stratum corneum&#xD;
      hydration, impaired epidermal lipid composition and epidermal differentiation. In this&#xD;
      proposed project, the investigators wish to examine the influence of pimecrolimus and&#xD;
      betamethasone valerate on transepidermal water loss (TEWL) as a marker of the skin barrier&#xD;
      function, on stratum corneum hydration, on stratum corneum lipid content and on epidermal&#xD;
      differentiation regarding keratins and cornified envelope proteins in AD patients. The study&#xD;
      involves biophysical measurements of TEWL and skin hydration, lipid analysis,&#xD;
      immuno-histochemistry, Western blotting and micro array techniques. This study shall clarify&#xD;
      whether pimecrolimus restores the epidermal barrier and whether this contributes to the&#xD;
      beneficial effect of pimecrolimus on AD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To explore the stratum corneum hydration, transepidermal water loss, capacity for barrier&#xD;
      repair and the integrity of the stratum corneum in patients treated with 1 % pimecrolimus&#xD;
      cream when applied twice a day to atopic dermatitis of the upper limbs, and to access the&#xD;
      substance's influences on the epidermis through histological, ultra-structural, and&#xD;
      biochemical analysis using punch biopsies from day 1 of one arm and day 22 from both treated&#xD;
      arms. 0.1 % betamethasone valerate cream b.i.d will be used as a control treatment.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Subjects may be included only if the following apply at the baseline visit (day 0, before&#xD;
        first application of study medication).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients to be included are:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Males and females of any race.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  &gt;= 18 years old.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have atopic dermatitis as defined by Hanifin and Rajka criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of mild to moderate atopic dermatitis&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  At least 10 % of each upper limb affected by atopic dermatitis excluding the surface&#xD;
             area of the hands, as these will not be treated in order to avoid cross-contamination.&#xD;
             As reference: one hand (palm and fingers) corresponds to 10% of patient's upper limb&#xD;
             surface.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  One specific, representative area of the disease on each upper limb with similar size&#xD;
             and severity on both upper limbs. These will be considered the target lesions.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A target lesion score of at least 3 to 8 (on a scale of 0-12) for both right and left&#xD;
             target lesions and not differing more than 1 score point between the right and left&#xD;
             sides.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  be able to suspended treatment of atopic dermatitis with other therapies for the&#xD;
             duration of the study (4-6 weeks).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Must be informed of study procedures and have signed the informed consent form&#xD;
             approved for the study.&#xD;

             approved method of contraception. &quot;Medically approved&quot; contraceptive may, at the&#xD;
             discretion of the investigator, include abstinence. (If patients are on oral&#xD;
             contraceptives, they must have begun treatment at least one month prior to baseline&#xD;
             and continue at least four weeks after the last treatment).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Other therapies/medications:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prior phototherapy or systemic therapy known to or suspected to have an effect on&#xD;
             atopic dermatitis within 14 days prior to first application of study medication.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Topical therapy known to or suspected to have an effect on atopic dermatitis on other&#xD;
             areas than upper limbs if total body surface treated is higher than 20% (due to the&#xD;
             higher risk of systemic absorption affecting the lesions of the upper limbs) within 7&#xD;
             days prior to first application of study medication&#xD;
&#xD;

             patient records)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who drug abuse problems, mental dysfunction or other factors limiting their&#xD;
             ability to cooperate fully&#xD;
