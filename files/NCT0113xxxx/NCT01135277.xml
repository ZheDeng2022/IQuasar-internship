  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients in the ICU are already predisposed to nosocomial infections, which are both costly&#xD;
      and potentially life threatening, and it appears that the immune paralysis of sepsis may put&#xD;
      these patients at greater risk for secondary infections, though this has not been proven&#xD;
      conclusively. One measure of this sepsis-induced immune suppression is monocyte deactivation.&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that, as a cornerstone of the monocytic innate immune response&#xD;
      to infection, the inflammasome is critical to monocyte function during sepsis.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Sepsis is a systemic inflammatory response to a severe infection. Despite the high incidence&#xD;
      and societal costs of sepsis, the mechanism by which it kills remains unclear. The&#xD;
      pathophysiology of sepsis is not completely understood, but many investigators now believe&#xD;
      that sepsis induces a prolonged state of immune suppression. This study will attempt to&#xD;
      quantify the degree of immune suppression during the first 5 days of sepsis by measuring the&#xD;
      immune function of peripheral blood monocytes and the inflammasome constituent proteins in&#xD;
      peripheral blood monocytes and alveolar macrophages.&#xD;
