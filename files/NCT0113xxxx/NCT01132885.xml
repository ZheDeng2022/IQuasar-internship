      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Little is known about how the brain changes during childhood and adolescence, how genes&#xD;
      affect this process, or how the brains of people with Williams syndrome change during this&#xD;
      period. Genetic features of Williams syndrome affect the brain s development, but the details&#xD;
      of this process have not been studied over time. Researchers are interested in using magnetic&#xD;
      resonance imaging to study how the brain changes in healthy children and children with&#xD;
      Williams syndrome and related genetic disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To study developmental changes in the brains of healthy children and children who have been&#xD;
      diagnosed with Williams syndrome or a related genetic disorder.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Healthy children and adolescents between 5 and 17 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Children and adolescents between 5 and 17 years of age who have been diagnosed with&#xD;
           Williams syndrome or genetic characteristics that overlap with Williams syndrome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will have a brief physical examination and tests of memory, attention,&#xD;
           concentration, and thinking. Parents will be asked about their child s personality,&#xD;
           behavior characteristics, and social interaction and communication skills.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Both participants and their parents may be asked to complete additional questionnaires&#xD;
           or take various tests as required for the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will have approximately 10 hours of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)&#xD;
           scanning, usually over 4 to 5 days, within a one month period. Some of these tests will&#xD;
           require the participants to do specific tasks while inside the MRI scanner.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be asked to return to the National Institutes of Health clinical&#xD;
           center to repeat these procedures every 2 years thereafter until age 18.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Williams syndrome (WS) is a rare disorder caused by hemizygous microdeletion of approximately&#xD;
      1.6 megabases on chromosomal band 7q11.23, typically by spontaneous mutation. The disorder is&#xD;
      characterized by a collection of unique neuropsychiatric manifestations, including marked&#xD;
      visuospatial construction deficits and hypersociability. Because the genes involved in WS are&#xD;
      known, the study of neural mechanisms in WS affords a privileged setting for investigating&#xD;
      genetic influences on complex brain functions in a bottom-up way.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Previous neuroimaging studies of adults with WS resulted in a clear delineation of the WS&#xD;
      brain phenotype. Underlying the syndrome s cognitive hallmark, visuospatial construction&#xD;
      impairment, is a neurostructural anomaly (decreased gray matter volume) and adjacent abnormal&#xD;
      neural function in the parietal sulcus region of the dorsal visual processing stream. Subtle&#xD;
      structural hippocampal alterations, along with abnormalities in regional cerebral blood flow,&#xD;
      neurofunctional activation, and N-acetyl aspartate concentration also contribute to the&#xD;
      visuospatial phenotype. Underlying the syndrome s social cognition features are structural&#xD;
      and functional abnormalities in the orbitofrontal cortex, an important affect and social&#xD;
      regulatory region that participates in a fronto-amygdala regulatory network found to be&#xD;
      dysfunctional in WS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The findings in adult WS patients have created a paradigm for identifying brain phenotypes&#xD;
      linked to specific genes and for guiding research aimed at understanding the mechanism by&#xD;
      which gene effects are translated in the brain to clinical phenomena. However, it is clear&#xD;
      that the cognitive and behavioral disturbances in WS emerge over the course of childhood and&#xD;
      adolescence from a complex interplay of altered neural systems, which must be studied from a&#xD;
      developmental and translational perspective. To meet this imperative, we propose a&#xD;
      cross-sectional and longitudinal neuroimaging study of children with WS to track the&#xD;
      emergence and modification of the altered neural circuitry observed in the adult population.&#xD;
      With non-invasive multimodal magnetic resonance imaging including structural MRI, functional&#xD;
      MRI (fMRI), and diffusion tensor MRI-we propose to target those neural systems associated&#xD;
      with key clinical features (e.g. visuospatial construction impairment and abnormal social&#xD;
      cognition). We will employ experimental methods previously successful in assessing cognitive&#xD;
      and emotional processing in the adult population. For neurofunctional studies, each task&#xD;
      paradigm is optimized to provide adequate statistical power for single subject mapping, and&#xD;
      to be amenable for young children. Additionally, structural MRI studies allowing for in depth&#xD;
      tracking of structural changes, including changes in gray-white matter ratios and the&#xD;
      integrity of white matter tracts throughout the brain. Blood samples for genetic analysis&#xD;
      will be collected. One hundred children with classic WS deletions, those with smaller&#xD;
      deletions, and those with duplications, along with 50 of their unaffected siblings, will be&#xD;
      studied at the NIH Clinical Center at two-year intervals for repeat neuroimaging studies.&#xD;
      Additionally, approximately 115 unrelated, healthy children will also be studied. fMRI tasks&#xD;
      will be piloted on fifteen of the latter. We will continue to study the children enrolled in&#xD;
      this protocol after they turn 18 in order to determine the developmental trajectory of brain&#xD;
      structure and function from childhood through adulthood. Additionally, fifty adults with&#xD;
      classic WS deletions, those with smaller deletions, and those with duplications will be&#xD;
      studied at the NIH Clinical Center at two-year intervals for repeat neuroimaging studies in&#xD;
      order to establish good adult end-points for our imaging protocol. Studying adults with WS&#xD;
      and abnormalities of the WS genetic region with the same tasks and scanner as used for&#xD;
      children will allow us to establish an adult WS comparison group against which children can&#xD;
      be directly compared and also allow us to better determine the maturation of neural structure&#xD;
      and function in WS through adulthood. Typically developing children whom we will continue to&#xD;
      study after they turn 18 will serve as the control comparison group for adults with WS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary outcome measures include size and integrity of grey and white matter; afunctional MRI&#xD;
      BOLD responses during rest, cognitive and emotion information processing; DTI anisotropy&#xD;
      measures of white matter tracts; tissue perfusion (blood flow) measured with arterial spin&#xD;
      labeling (ASL); and mcDespot myelin water fraction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcome measures include relationship of neuropsychological assessments and&#xD;
      genotyping to the imaging results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our prior success in delineating the brain phenotype in adult WS patients will provide the&#xD;
      crucial context within which to view the emergence and modification of these neural circuit&#xD;
      abnormalities from a developmental perspective in children with WS and from which to launch&#xD;
      translational studies of specific gene effects on brain and behavioral phenotypes.&#xD;
