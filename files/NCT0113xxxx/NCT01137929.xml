      No single host or pathogen trait identified by previous research can be correlated with all&#xD;
      cases of childhood acute pyelonephritis or APN (i.e., kidney/upper urinary tract infections)&#xD;
      and APN-associated renal scarring (the outcome with the highest morbidity), making it&#xD;
      difficult for physicians to determine which patients will be affected. Our proposal is to&#xD;
      comprehensively study the relationships between the clinical manifestations of urinary tract&#xD;
      infections (UTIs), the host risk factors and immune response, and the microbial species that&#xD;
      cause these conditions. The result of the study will be a clinical severity score to&#xD;
      personalize diagnostic and treatment strategies for infants with UTI, with the goal of&#xD;
      decreasing the morbidity of APN/renal scarring and improving patient outcomes.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are the most common serious bacterial infections in young&#xD;
      children, with acute pyelonephritis or APN (i.e., kidney/upper urinary tract infections) and&#xD;
      APN-associated renal scarring causing the most potential long-term damage to a child's&#xD;
      health. Approximately two-thirds of young children with febrile UTI (UTIF or UTI presenting&#xD;
      with fever) will have APN, making UTIF a major indicator of APN. Other than the presence of&#xD;
      fever, it is currently difficult for physicians to determine which infant patients have or&#xD;
      will develop APN and renal scarring. Individual risk factors for the host (e.g.,&#xD;
      uncircumcised males, cytokine production) and the pathogen (e.g., presence of fimbriae for&#xD;
      adhesion) have individually been linked to APN and renal scarring, but no single trait&#xD;
      identified can be correlated with all cases. Multiple factors on both sides of the&#xD;
      host-pathogen relationship likely interact to determine the severity of the illness and the&#xD;
      outcome. Although the NIDDK/NIH is currently funding two clinical trials to investigate the&#xD;
      rate of recurrent UTI and the rate of renal scarring in children (Randomized Intervention of&#xD;
      Children with Vesicoureteral REflux, RIVUR; and Careful urinary Tract Infection Evaluation,&#xD;
      CUTIE) neither of these studies will be able to identify the child's initial risk for having&#xD;
      APN since patient recruitment will occur too long after treatment of the UTI. Also, neither&#xD;
      study proposes as a specific goal to obtain bacteriological samples with which to study the&#xD;
      microbe's role in the pathogenesis of APN. Thus, to the best of our knowledge, no&#xD;
      comprehensive study exists that aims to analyze the relationships between the clinical&#xD;
      manifestations of UTIs, the host risk factors and immune response, and the microbial species&#xD;
      that cause these conditions. Our proposed collaborative study between Children's National&#xD;
      Medical Center (CNMC) and the J. Craig Venter Institute (JCVI) will collect clinical data as&#xD;
      well as urine and blood samples from six distinct infant patient populations presenting with&#xD;
      UTIF and correlate the clinical, host, and pathogen data for each patient with the severity&#xD;
      of the disease and development of APN and renal scarring. Metagenomic and genomic sequencing&#xD;
      on the urine and isolated bacteria, respectively, will allow us to comprehensively study both&#xD;
      the culturable and unculturable pathogens responsible for the UTI. Using a genome-wide&#xD;
      association study (GWAS) we will evaluate the polymorphisms of all known UTI-associated host&#xD;
      genes, paying particular attention to the immune system host genes previously identified as&#xD;
      potentially linked to APN. To correlate all collected data a publicly available database and&#xD;
      website will be created to allow physicians and scientists to traverse the data. Using the&#xD;
      data collected in the database, the final result of the study will be a clinical severity&#xD;
      score to personalize diagnostic and treatment strategies for infants with UTIF, with the goal&#xD;
      of decreasing the morbidity of APN and improving patient outcomes. An improved understanding&#xD;
      of the microbial risk factors associated with APN and renal scarring will allow for better&#xD;
      diagnostic approaches and improved methods for treating patients, inclusive of novel&#xD;
      medications in at risk individuals.&#xD;

    <description>Children under two years of age will undergo a 99m-Tc-DMSA renal scan for the detection of acute pyelonephritis lesions within 72 hours of presentation to the ED for evaluation of a fever and positive urine culture.

      Urine samples: Urine is routinely collected at the time of presentation with fever to&#xD;
      diagnose UTI and an aliquot of this urine sample will be frozen for microbial genomic and&#xD;
      metagenomic sequencing and analysis, that will allow us to identify&#xD;
      unique/pathogenic/virulence factors in the genomes of these bacterial species when compared&#xD;
      to non-pathogenic strains that have been subject to whole genome sequencing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood: DNA samples will be obtained at the time of renal scanning from the study subjects.&#xD;
      The genomic DNA is used in PCR reactions and the resulting PCR products are screened for&#xD;
      single nucelotide polymorphisms. Although we will be performing a genome wide association&#xD;
      study, we will be particularly curious as to the behavior of SNP's among certain previously&#xD;
      described candidates for the risk of renal scarring such as TLR2, TLR4, TGF-beta, and&#xD;
      TNF-alpha. DNA samples will be stored for possible use in other future association studies.&#xD;
