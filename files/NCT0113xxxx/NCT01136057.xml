      Treatment options are limited for the treatment of influenza. This study will collect blood&#xD;
      from people who have been exposed to the influenza virus or who have received a seasonal&#xD;
      influenza vaccine. The blood plasma will be used in a future clinical trial to treat people&#xD;
      hospitalized with influenza.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There is a concern that the influenza virus will become resistant to the standard of care,&#xD;
      oseltamivir (commonly known as Tamiflu), as resistance to this medication has been observed&#xD;
      in people infected with the seasonal influenza virus. Because of the possibility of drug&#xD;
      resistance, additional treatment options for influenza are needed. The purpose of this study&#xD;
      is to collect blood from people who have recovered from influenza or who have received a&#xD;
      seasonal influenza vaccine. The blood will then be processed into Food and Drug&#xD;
      Administration (FDA)-licensed fresh frozen plasma (FFP). In a future clinical trial, this&#xD;
      plasma will be used as a treatment for people hospitalized with influenza.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will enroll people who have recovered from influenza or received a seasonal&#xD;
      influenza vaccine. Participants will donate blood at FDA-licensed blood donor centers up to&#xD;
      three times during the 240-day study period.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Currently healthy males 18 - 59 years of age with a history suggestive of having&#xD;
             anti-influenza antibodies (either or both of the following):&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. An influenza-like illness (e.g., fever, chills, malaise, cough, myalgias,&#xD;
                  nausea). Subjects must asymptomatic and must be afebrile for â‰¥ 7 days, and must&#xD;
                  enroll within 12 months of onset of illness.&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Vaccinated with a licensed influenza vaccine. Enrollment must occur &gt;14 days and&#xD;
                  &lt; 12 months from date of vaccination.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Must be an adult male Department of Defense (DoD)/beneficiary&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Sign informed consent and Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)&#xD;
             document&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A demonstrated H1N1 HAI titer of 1:160 or greater and H3N2 HAI titer of 1:40 or&#xD;
             greater.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Must also meet all Standard-of-Care inclusion criteria for donation of blood or plasma&#xD;
             at the FDA-licensed donor center prior to every donation session. More information on&#xD;
