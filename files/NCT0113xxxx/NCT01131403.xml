      Study design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of the present study is to analyse of the influence of the application of the&#xD;
      skin care products on the diaper area (Factor A) and the application of a cotton wool cloth,&#xD;
      moistened with clear water on the diaper area (Faktor B) on the skin barrier function of the&#xD;
      newborns during the first four weeks. Additionally, the microbiological colonisation of the&#xD;
      skin will be observed. After four weeks all infants in both groups will obtain wet wipe and&#xD;
      after 8 weeks a facultative measurement will be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary and secondary end points:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the present study, as a primary end point TEWL on the buttock was chosen, because the&#xD;
      significant difference between the infants who were bathed and washed in the previous study&#xD;
      was found.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary end points are the TEWL on the other measuring points, pH-value and SCH.&#xD;
      Additionally, secondary end points are the D-Squame method and the cytokine measurement with&#xD;
      Sebutapes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypotheses:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intention of the study is to evaluate, whether the using of wet wipe on the diaper area&#xD;
      has an influence on the TEWL of the newborns. The following hypotheses are present below:&#xD;
&#xD;
      H0 (Null hypothesis): The TEWL is indistinguishable between infants who get cleaned with wet&#xD;
      wipe on the diaper area and infants who get cleaned with a cotton wool cloth, moistened with&#xD;
      clear water on the diaper area, i.e.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TEWL clear water is equal TEWL wet wipe against H1 (Alternative hypothesis - bilateral): The&#xD;
      TEWL is distinguishable between infants who get cleaned with wet wipe on the diaper area and&#xD;
      infants who get cleaned with a cotton wool cloth, moistened with clear water on the diaper&#xD;
      area, i.e.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TEWL clear water is not equal TEWL wet wipe&#xD;

      Method and number of subjects:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Monocenter, prospective, randomized study with two parallel groups. To get reliable results,&#xD;
      the number of male and female newborns to be included in this study is 40.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The group of 40 healthy full-term newborn babies will be divided into 2 groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Number of groups and subjects Application of skin care products&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. 01-19 Using of wet wipe during the diaper changes&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. 20-40 Using a cotton wool cloth, moistened with clear water during the diaper changes.&#xD;
           The measurement take place at the Clinical Research Center for Hair and Skin Physiology,&#xD;
           at the Department of Dermatology, Campus Charité Mitte and also at the Department of&#xD;
           Neonatology Campus Charité Mitte, Charité-Universitätsmedizin Berlin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study plan:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Application:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All newborns will obtain a standard skin care, according to division into one of the&#xD;
      followings groups: it will be used wet wipe during the diaper changes or a cotton wool cloth&#xD;
      moistened with clear water. Additionally, the infants of both groups will be bathed twice a&#xD;
      week according to following standard schema. The infant will be submerged in bathtub half&#xD;
      filled with water, up to the shoulder.The water temperature should be ca. 370C, pH 7.9-8.2&#xD;
      and the bathing should not require longer than 5 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All healthy (i.e. meeting none of the non-inclusion criteria) term newborns are possible&#xD;
      candidates for the study. The following criteria must be met for enrollment in the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Male and female term newborns from 37 completed weeks of gestation, age ≤ 48 hours&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Written informed parental consent&#xD;
&#xD;
      Non-inclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Any critically ill term newborn, i.e. septic infants, infants born with serious&#xD;
           congenital malformation/defects, asphyxia, hydronephrosis, severe intracranial&#xD;
           hemorrhage&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Newborns with known immunodeficiency&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Newborns with pre-existing skin disease with eruptions covering more than 50% of body&#xD;
           surface i.e. congenital ichthyosis, congenital candidiasis&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Newborn has relevant skin maceration, which influence the measurements or is&#xD;
           communicable i.e. urticaria or herpes&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Any acutely or chronically ill newborn with temperatures below 35°C or above 40°C&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Newborn is taking part in another study or is during a term of exclusion of a study.&#xD;
