      Rationale:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Contrast agents are important tools for MR/CT- examinations, when it comes to diagnosing&#xD;
      diseases. But despite their frequent use in Denmark, they are not free of serious and&#xD;
      potentially fatal adverse reactions. Examples of this are contrast-induced nephropathy (CIN)&#xD;
      and nephrogenic systemic fibrosis (NSF). Therefore, it is extremely important to clarify if&#xD;
      these adverse reactions are actually directly related to the use of contrast agents or to&#xD;
      MR/CT- examinations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To prospectively assess the incidence of adverse reactions of iodine-containing CT and&#xD;
      gadolinium- based MR contrast agents in a prospective design. A control group examined&#xD;
      without the use of contrast agent will be included, so that the study can illuminate reported&#xD;
      adverse events related to contrast agents and CT/MR- examinations. This project will in the&#xD;
      long term mean that, any significant and life-threatening delayed adverse reactions will be&#xD;
      discovered earlier and hence it will be more likely to treat the patients in good time for&#xD;
      these adverse reactions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following series of hypotheses will be investigated in this study:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Renal as well as non-renal adverse reactions occurring are related to the use of&#xD;
           contrast agent in MR-/CT-examination.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. CIN occurs in patients undergoing a MR-/CT-examination with contrast agent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Approvals are obtained from The Copenhagen County Committee on Biomedical Research Ethics and&#xD;
      Danish Data Protection Agency. A total of 1600 patients will be included from Department of&#xD;
      Radiology at Herlev Hospital, where all the MR- and CT examinations will be performed.&#xD;
      Patients will be divided into four groups (a, b, c and d) with 400 patients in each group.&#xD;
      Group a and c (case group) undergo respectively MR and CT examination with contrast agent&#xD;
      While group b and d (control group) will undergo respectively MR and CT examination without&#xD;
      the use of contrast agent. For each patient the following will be recorded: Risk factors,&#xD;
      renal function (eGFR) before and 72 hours after MR/CT- examination as well as the incidence&#xD;
      of immediate reactions (within 30 min.). Furthermore, patients have to answer a questionnaire&#xD;
      72 hours and 1 month after MR/CT- examination about the severity and frequency of adverse&#xD;
      reactions to contrast media.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Rationale and objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Contrast agents continue to cause concern among patients and doctors because of their&#xD;
      widespread use and the rare but potentially important adverse reactions associated with them.&#xD;
      Intravenous (into a vein) contrast agents are used daily for both Computed Tomography (CT)&#xD;
      and Magnetic Resonance (MR) examinations as an aid for detection and characterization of&#xD;
      diseases. Despite their use for millions of examinations each year, the contrast agents are&#xD;
      not entirely free of serious and potentially life-threatening adverse reactions. Therefore,&#xD;
      the application of both iodine-containing and gadolinium-based contrast agents, respectively&#xD;
      for CT and MR- examinations has raised some safety concerns, especially in patients in&#xD;
      certain risk groups, e.g. patients with previous allergic reactions to gadolinium and&#xD;
      iodine-containing contrast agents, patients with pre-existing renal impairment and diabetes&#xD;
      patients. Adverse reactions of contrast agents can be divided into non-renal and renal&#xD;
      adverse reactions. The non-renal adverse reactions may be acute or delayed. The acute adverse&#xD;
      reactions occur within one hour after the contrast agent is administered to the patient,&#xD;
      while the delayed adverse reactions occur after one hour and within a week.Some reactions&#xD;
      such as Nephrogenic Systemic Fibrosis (NSF) may occur even later and is classified as a very&#xD;
      late adverse reaction. Patients at high risk group should be identified before contrast agent&#xD;
      administration to avoid these adverse reactions. Adverse reactions using iodine-containing&#xD;
      contrast agents have been known for over 20 years. They are mostly mild or moderate skin&#xD;
      reactions that occur during the period 1 hour to 7 days after contrast agent administration,&#xD;
      and usually disappear within 3-7 days. Nevertheless, serious and life-threatening adverse&#xD;
      reactions occur, and one of the most serious effects is Contrast Induced Nephropathy (CIN),&#xD;
      which is a renal adverse reaction. CIN refers to a reduction in the renal function induced by&#xD;
      contrast agent. This implies a deterioration in renal function (an increase in serum&#xD;
      creatinine by more than 25% or 44Î¼mol / L) occurring within three days after intravascular&#xD;
      administration of iodine-containing contrast agent. CIN is a well known complication when it&#xD;
      comes to radiological studies using iodine-containing contrast agents. The rapid development&#xD;
      and frequent use of CT- examination with simultaneous administration of relatively large&#xD;
      doses of iodine-containing contrast agents have contributed to a growing number of cases of&#xD;
      CIN during recent years. For many years, gadolinium-based contrast agents have been&#xD;
      considered as safe, but in 2006 the first reporting of patients who had developed a new rare&#xD;
      potentially fatal disease called NSF in the weeks after exposure to gadolinium-based contrast&#xD;
      agents began. However, it was not until 2006 that the NSF was linked to gadolinium contrast&#xD;
      agents and it was proposed that the free gadolinium from the contrast agent could be a&#xD;
      trigger for NSF. NSF is a connective tissue disease which usually manifests itself as a skin&#xD;
      disease with swelling in arms and legs, but can also affect internal organs. NSF occurs in&#xD;
      combination with chronic kidney disease and has only recently been particularly investigated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, it is essential to clarify if these reactions are actually directly related to the&#xD;
      application of contrast agents or to MR/CT-examinations. Most major studies conducted on&#xD;
      gadolinium-based and iodine-containing contrast agents have been retrospective, and so far no&#xD;
      similar large scale study has been performed independently from pharmaceutical companies.&#xD;
      Thus, there is a lack of independent studies, which investigate the severity of adverse&#xD;
      reactions as well as delayed adverse reactions one month after the patients have been exposed&#xD;
      to the contrast agent.The study aim is to investigate the safety profile for respectively&#xD;
      iodine-containing and gadolinium-based contrast agents to CT and MR- examinations in a&#xD;
      prospective design. A control group examined without the use of contrast agent will be&#xD;
      included, so that the study can illuminate reported adverse reactions related to contrast&#xD;
      agents and CT/MR-examinations. This applies to renal, non-renal, and late adverse reactions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This project will ultimately illuminate any significant and life-threatening late effects and&#xD;
      therefore, these will be detected earlier, and it will become more likely to treat the&#xD;
      patients in good time for these events. The following series of hypotheses will be&#xD;
      investigated in this study:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Renal as well as non-renal adverse reactions occurring are related to the use of&#xD;
           contrast agent in MR-/CT-examination.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. CIN occurs in patients undergoing a MR-/CT-examination with contrast agent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Approvals from The Copenhagen County Committee on Biomedical Research Ethics and The Danish&#xD;
      Data Protection Agency are obtained. The study will be conducted as a prospective study at&#xD;
      Herlev Hospital, Department of Radiology. Patients referred to an MR/CT-examination will be&#xD;
      offered participation in the study. Since the patients are referred to a MR-/CT-examination&#xD;
      as part of their patient diagnostic evaluation, the distribution into different groups will&#xD;
      be without any influence from the study officials.The study includes a total of 1600 patients&#xD;
      in a period of approximately 2 years. The patients will be distributed in four groups (a, b,&#xD;
      c and d) with 400 patients in each group. Group a and c (case group) undergo respectively MR-&#xD;
      and CT- examinations with respectively gadolinium-based contrast agent and iodine-containing&#xD;
      contrast agent. Group b and d (control groups) will undergo MR/CT-examination without any use&#xD;
      of contrast agent. Informed consent will be obtained from all patients. Data will be&#xD;
      collected continuously. For each participating patient the following will be registered: risk&#xD;
      factors (patients allergic to gadolinium-based and iodine-containing contrast agents,&#xD;
      patients with renal impairment and diabetes), estimated kidney function (eGFR) with a finger&#xD;
      stick blood test immediately before and 72 hours after the MR/CT-examination. The blood test&#xD;
      is quick, easy and requires no more than a small stick on the side of the finger tip with a&#xD;
      finger stick. The blood drop is placed on a test strip and into a renal function meter,&#xD;
      whereupon eGFR is read. The test strip will be destroyed immediately after completion of the&#xD;
      test/ measurement. To detect the occurrence of acute adverse reactions after administration&#xD;
      of contrast agents, the patients are observed for 30 min. Patients in the control groups will&#xD;
      also be observed for 30 minutes after start of MR/CT-examination. All patients are supplied&#xD;
      with two questionnaires regarding the occurrence of adverse reactions and possible delayed&#xD;
      reactions, which they must complete 72 hours and one month after MR/CT-examination. Results&#xD;
      from group a will be compared with results from group b, while the results from group c will&#xD;
      be compared with results from group d. This study will not be statistically randomized, since&#xD;
      it is an observational study. Furthermore, it is necessary to have a major control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adverse reactions, risks and disadvantages:There are no known adverse reactions in this&#xD;
      study, when the exclusion criteria are met. Patients will already be referred for an MR/CT-&#xD;
      examination, and contrast agents that are already approved by health authorities will be used&#xD;
      as tools for MR/CT-examinations. Therefore, this study does not pose a greater risk or&#xD;
      inconvenience to the participants. Moreover, there are no adverse reactions associated with&#xD;
      the blood tests measurement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Economic conditions:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study officials have no financial ties to private firms or pharmaceutical companies with&#xD;
      interest in this study. Since the majority of researches on contrast agents are made by&#xD;
      pharmaceutical companies, this project is important and of great interest since it is&#xD;
      independent from the pharmaceutical industry. Therefore, the project's conclusions will not&#xD;
      be influenced by strategic and economic interests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethical considerations:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is unique in the sense that it so far is, the only major prospective study that&#xD;
      follows patients one month after completion of MR/CT-examination. The study is primarily&#xD;
      intended as a method to clarify the extent of late adverse reactions that may occur after the&#xD;
      patient has left the examination room. For precisely these contrast agents, it is&#xD;
      advantageous to have a study which provides a comprehensive systematic overview of acute and&#xD;
      late adverse reactions, because many severe and life-threatening late adverse reactions occur&#xD;
      days and even weeks after the contrast agent administration. We hope that this study will&#xD;
      result in an improved documentation of whether the incidences of acute and delayed severe&#xD;
      adverse reactions are directly related to the use of contrast agents for MR/CT-examinations.&#xD;
      This will increase patient safety because; it will help clarifying whether adverse reactions&#xD;
      are related to contrast agents or MR/CT-examination. For the individual participant the&#xD;
      benefit of participation in this study means that, in future any significant delayed adverse&#xD;
      reaction will be discovered in time. Furthermore, a detection of the presence of mild or/and&#xD;
      moderate adverse reactions will lead to, an earlier treatment of these adverse reactions.&#xD;
