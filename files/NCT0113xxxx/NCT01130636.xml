      The main purpose of this study is to assess the potential exposure of neonates to oseltamivir&#xD;
      during lactation by examining oseltamivir concentrations in maternal blood, urine, and breast&#xD;
      milk in breastfeeding women who are treated with oseltamivir, an anti-flu medication.&#xD;

      Investigational Medical Product: Tamiflu® 75 mg hard capsules&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: The main purpose of this study is to assess the potential neonatal exposure to&#xD;
      oseltamivir during lactation by examining oseltamivir concentrations in maternal blood,&#xD;
      urine, and breast milk/colostrum.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design: Single-country, multicenter, observational pharmacokinetic study&#xD;
&#xD;
      Enrolment and follow-up: Lactating women (up to 20 subjects) who present with clinical&#xD;
      symptoms indicative of influenza will be recruited (a maximum of 6 months period of&#xD;
      recruitment) to receive immediate treatment with oseltamivir (Tamiflu® 75 mg hard capsules,&#xD;
      provided free of charges for the study) at a standard dose of 75 mg twice daily. These&#xD;
      subjects will have a 12 hour pharmacokinetic plasma, urine and breast milk study undertaken&#xD;
      after the steady state in oseltamivir concentrations (both active and inactive metabolites&#xD;
      will be measured) is reached in blood, i.e. after three days after treatment. Subjects do not&#xD;
      need laboratory confirmation of influenza infection for inclusion in this study, although the&#xD;
      results of any virological tests that seek to confirm influenza infection will be recorded.&#xD;
      Maternal venous blood (2 samples, one pre-dose sample and one 2.5-hours-after-dose sample),&#xD;
      urine samples (obtained from total urine output within 12 h), and breast milk/colostrum&#xD;
      samples (8 samples within 12 h) are taken to determine oseltamivir phosphate (inactive&#xD;
      metabolite) and oseltamivir carboxylate (active metabolite) levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety: Adverse events (AEs) and serious adverse events (SAEs) will be recorded. SAEs will be&#xD;
      reported to the Ethics Committee and Regulatory authorities according to the reporting&#xD;
      requirements in Hungary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Number of patients: A total of 20 lactating patients will be enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Number of centres: Up to 3 investigational sites in Hungary will participate in the study.&#xD;
      All sites will belong to an academic institution.&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to the approved protocol amendment 1 (dated: 31/Aug/2010) the time schedule is the&#xD;
      following: The patient visits are planned as soon as possible during the pandemic season in&#xD;
      Q3-Q4 2010 and Q1-Q2 2011. The study will run until enrollment is completed and all study&#xD;
      procedures have been completed for the last subject in 2011.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. The patient is breastfeeding, or has just given birth.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. The age of the patient is at least 18 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Written Informed Consent obtained from the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. The patient has received a diagnosis of influenza based upon the following clinical&#xD;
             symptoms, during a time when influenza is known to be circulating:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  fever ≥37.8oC at the time of examination or a history of fever and&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  at least one respiratory symptom (cough, coryza, sore throat, rhinitis)&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Confirmation of infection with influenza is not required for inclusion. As H1N1v&#xD;
             infection in pregnancy and lactation is a dangerous condition, and recommendations are&#xD;
             that clinicians should commence antiviral therapy on an empiric basis and not wait for&#xD;
             the results for laboratory investigations. Therefore, this study will not undertake or&#xD;
             require any virological investigations, although these will be recorded if undertaken&#xD;
             as part of routine care.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Clinical suspicion of infection with a respiratory virus other than influenza and a&#xD;
             decision by the treating physician that treatment with oseltamivir is not indicated.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Suspicion of invasive bacterial infection requiring immediate admission to hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Evidence of a poorly controlled underlying medical condition, with the specific&#xD;
             understanding that pregnancy does constitute an exclusion factor in this&#xD;
             influenza-related study. Positive test with one of the following methods for pregnancy&#xD;
             excludes patient from participation:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  β-HCG blood test&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  β-HCG urine test&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  ultrasound examination confirming pregnancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Known or suspected immunosuppression (malignancy, transplant, immunosuppressive drugs)&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Known allergy to oseltamivir.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Participation in any clinical trials with an investigational drug or vaccine within&#xD;
             the previous 3 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. A history of uncontrolled seizures, central nervous system disorders or psychiatric&#xD;
             disability judged by the Investigator to be clinically significant and adversely&#xD;
             affecting compliance to study drug.&#xD;
