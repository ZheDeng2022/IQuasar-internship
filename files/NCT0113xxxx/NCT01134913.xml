      This is a prospective clinical study designed to procure blood samples from patients who&#xD;
      present to the Emergency Department with suspected ACS (Acute Coronary Syndrome).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects enrolled in this study will sign and informed consent and have 4 blood samples drawn&#xD;
      at different time points during their emergency department visit. In addition, data will be&#xD;
      collected about the patient's health history, hospital procedures, and final diagnosis. The&#xD;
      enrolling center will also contact the patients at 30-days, 3 months and 6 months to inquire&#xD;
      about their condition and survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood samples collected in this study will be sent to the sponsor organization for long-term&#xD;
      storage and analysis in the future for novel blood markers as they become available. No&#xD;
      genetic testing will be conducted on these samples.&#xD;

      This is a prospective, multi-center, observational, and sample procurement study of adult&#xD;
      subjects presenting to an Emergency Department (ED) in whom ACS is in the differential&#xD;
      diagnosis. Subjects must present to one of the participating EDs within 6 hours or less from&#xD;
      the time of symptom onset, and must have experienced at least 5 minutes of chest discomfort.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Those ED patients with possible ACS who meet the inclusion/exclusion criteria will be&#xD;
      approached for study enrollment by trained research personnel.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patient's diagnostic work-up and treatment will continue per the standards of the&#xD;
      treating institution. As indicated by their clinical presentation, it is anticipated that all&#xD;
      patients in this study will have an electrocardiogram (ECG) upon admission to the ED and if&#xD;
      the patient is found not to have an ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), objective&#xD;
      cardiac testing will be conducted for evidence of MI. The Principal Investigator at each site&#xD;
      will evaluate the results of the objective cardiac tests combined with biomarker evidence of&#xD;
      myocardial necrosis to determine whether or not a patient enrolled at their site has a final&#xD;
      diagnosis of ACS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cardiac events and procedure, such as angioplasty-stenting and coronary artery bypass surgery&#xD;
      (CABG), will be recorded during the index ED visit, hospitalization and post-hospital&#xD;
      follow-up period. Subjects will have a 30-day, 3 month and 6 month follow-up contact by phone&#xD;
      or medical chart review to collect this information on cardiac events, procedures and&#xD;
      survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood samples collected at several time points during the index ED visit will be used for&#xD;
      future testing of novel blood markers as they become available.&#xD;
