  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Tenofovir 1% gel is an investigational vaginal microbicide intended to reduce the risk of&#xD;
      transmission of HIV. Pregnant women and mothers who have recently given birth often maintain&#xD;
      sexual activity, and research has shown that they may be at greater risk of HIV infection&#xD;
      during pregnancy. Microbicides may be able to prevent HIV infection during pregnancy, which&#xD;
      would also prevent fetal exposure to HIV. This study will test the safety of using tenofovir&#xD;
      1% gel in healthy, pregnant women and healthy, breastfeeding women.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Microbicides are substances, like gels or foams, being developed that can be applied before&#xD;
      intercourse to prevent transmission of HIV. Research has shown that pregnant women are still&#xD;
      at risk of sexual transmission of HIV, and some research has suggested that pregnant women&#xD;
      may be at increased risk of HIV infection. Microbicides may also aid in preventing&#xD;
      mother-to-child transmission of HIV, because they might be a feasible alternative to oral or&#xD;
      intravenous medications in regions where these methods are difficult to implement. In tests&#xD;
      on healthy women the vaginal microbicide tenofovir 1% gel has been safe and well tolerated.&#xD;
      This study will test the safety of tenofovir 1% gel in healthy, pregnant women and healthy,&#xD;
      lactating women.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participation in this study will last approximately 3 to 10 weeks. Pregnant women will be&#xD;
      followed until approximately 2 weeks after delivery of their children, and lactating women&#xD;
      will be followed for 3 weeks. Pregnant women will be given either the tenofovir 1% gel or a&#xD;
      placebo gel to be applied daily for 7 days. Groups of pregnant women will be further divided&#xD;
      according to how late into pregnancy they enroll.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pregnant women will have study visits at enrollment, 6 days after enrollment, and at&#xD;
      delivery. They will also participate in phone assessments 1, 3, and 14 days after enrollment&#xD;
      and at delivery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lactating women will be given tenofovir 1% gel and have study visits at enrollment and 6 days&#xD;
      after enrollment. They will also participate in phone assessments 1, 3, and 14 days after&#xD;
      enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will complete blood tests, physical exams, and assessments of adverse&#xD;
      events.&#xD;
