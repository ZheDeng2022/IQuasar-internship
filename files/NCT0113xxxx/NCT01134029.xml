      The researchers propose a randomized controlled trial to evaluate how well an intervention,&#xD;
      Planned Care for Obesity &amp; Risk Reduction (Planned CORR), supports primary care treatment of&#xD;
      obesity in adults with at least one cardiovascular risk factor (CVRF). We will assess how&#xD;
      well it creates initial and sustained improvements in BMI and metabolic, anthropometric and&#xD;
      behavioral outcomes in obese adults, age 25 to 70 who have one or more of the following&#xD;
      CVRFs: hypertension, smoking or the metabolic syndrome. Planned CORR integrates intervention&#xD;
      components based on behavior change theory with a delivery strategy based on the Chronic Care&#xD;
      Model (Wagner et al, 2001; also called the &quot;Planned Care Model&quot;) and is designed to&#xD;
      incorporate intervention principles used successfully to treat obesity. Planned CORR is&#xD;
      intended to be compatible with a variety of primary care settings including those with&#xD;
      minimal resources to devote to patient education and where most obese adults receive their&#xD;
      usual medical care. Study participants will be 380 women and men, age 25-70 who meet the&#xD;
      entry criteria of obesity (Class I &amp; II; BMI 30-45) plus one or more CVRFs. We anticipate&#xD;
      that approximately 40% will be Hispanic and we will recruit an equal number of women and men&#xD;
      and have powered the study to do analyses by gender. Planned CORR is a stepped care&#xD;
      intervention that begins with computer-assisted assessment and tailored action planning,&#xD;
      physician or nurse practitioner counseling, and an intensive &quot;first step&quot; of 4 months of&#xD;
      lifestyle modification delivered via monthly in-person sessions and phone calls and weekly&#xD;
      web or mail (based on preference) tutorials.CVRFs are managed concurrently according to&#xD;
      recognized evidence-based protocols. Successive 4-month steps involve more, the same, or less&#xD;
      intensive intervention depending on clinical response. The primary aim is to evaluate the&#xD;
      effects at 12 &amp; 24 months of Planned CORR on BMI when compared to enhanced usual care.&#xD;
      Secondary aims will evaluate: CVRF outcomes; physiological, metabolic, behavioral, and&#xD;
      psychosocial factors related to obesity and CVRFs; quality of life, depression and&#xD;
      cost-effectiveness; and medical care quality, patient, provider &amp; staff satisfaction, process&#xD;
      measures relevant to implementation in primary care. Post study aims are to disseminate the&#xD;
      knowledge gained from the intervention through conferences and publications, and to&#xD;
      disseminate Planned CORR through proven channels of health care intervention dissemination.&#xD;
