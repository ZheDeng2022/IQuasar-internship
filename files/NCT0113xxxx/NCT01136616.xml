      Aim:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Study the 3-dimensional anatomy of the nasal buttresses.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Diagnose fracture patterns in the nasal buttresses.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Identify the buttress fractures associated with deviation of the external nasal&#xD;
           morphology.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Identify the buttress fractures associated with septal deviation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Assess the airflow patterns and its associated distribution of flow velocity, pressure,&#xD;
           and wall shear stress in the nasal cavity for patient specific models with nose&#xD;
           fracture.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Assess the stress distribution in the nasal bone structures subject to various scenarios&#xD;
           of loading conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology:&#xD;
&#xD;
      67 consecutive patients admitted for facial fractures and who undergo routine CT scans of the&#xD;
      face with our protocol of axial and coronal sections taken at 0.6mm and gantry 0 are to be&#xD;
      studied. The CT scans are evaluated to assess the position, comminution and displacement of&#xD;
      the 5 said buttresses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The buttresses are graded Grade 1 Simple fracture without displacement Grade 2 Simple&#xD;
      fracture with displacement Grade 3 Comminuted fracture without displacement Grade 4&#xD;
      Comminuted fracture with minimal displacement Grade 5 Comminuted fractured with displacement&#xD;
&#xD;
      The septum is graded from Grade 0 Septum is straight Grade 1 Septum is deviated by less than&#xD;
      1 half the distance from the midline to the nasal turbinate Grade 2 Septum is deviated by&#xD;
      more than 1 half the distance from the midline to the nasal turbinate Grade 3 Septum is&#xD;
      almost touching the nasal turbinate&#xD;
&#xD;
      Variables to be assessed included&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Grade of Severity of Nasal and Septal fracture&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Which is the weakest buttress that is most commonly broken?&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Which is the least often fractured and strongest buttress?&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Which buttress or buttresses are involved in a undisplaced septal fracture?&#xD;
&#xD;
             4. Which buttress or buttresses are involved in a displaced septal fracture?&#xD;
&#xD;
             5. Which buttresses or buttresses are involved in a undisplaced nasal fracture?&#xD;
&#xD;
             6. Which buttress or buttresses are involved in a displaced nasal fracture?&#xD;
&#xD;
             7. For a buttress to be displaced, the number of fractures in a single buttress?&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Assessment of biomechanical stability&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Assessment of stress distribution in the nasal buttresses for various scenarios of&#xD;
                external loadings&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Assessment of nasal fracture patterns in different traumatic forces&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Assessment of stress wave propagation in the nasal bones during impact.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Assessment of nasal air-flow via the nasal airways&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods for data management and analysis (incl. Biostatistical check)&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Segmentation and Reconstruction of 3D Nasal Model&#xD;
&#xD;
           Given the CT images of a patient, the nasal bones and surrounding facial bones are&#xD;
           segmented and a 3D model of the bones is reconstructed. This can be accomplished using a&#xD;
           segmentation and 3D reconstruction software. We have developed a preliminary version of&#xD;
           the software for segmenting and reconstructing 3D model of craniofacial bones based on&#xD;
           fast marching method. The software can be adapted to focus on reconstructing 3D model of&#xD;
           the nasal buttresses.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Nonlinear Registration with Reference Model&#xD;
&#xD;
           The 3D fractured model is registered with a normal reference model for fracture&#xD;
           analysis. A novel nonlinear registration technique is required to decouple normal&#xD;
           variations among normal people and variations due to fractures. In this way, the normal&#xD;
           reference model can be deformed in a manner consistent with normal variations to&#xD;
           register to the fractured model. After registration, the registered reference could&#xD;
           serve as a model of the patient prior to the injury. Moreover, differences between the&#xD;
           fractured model and the registered reference would indicate variations due to fractures.&#xD;
           The extent of the fractures and displacements of bones can also be measured.&#xD;
&#xD;
           To accomplish the novel nonlinear registration, a generalized form of source separation&#xD;
           method is needed. In particular, the idea of discriminates subspace analysis (Zhang and&#xD;
           Sim) developed by our colleagues for analyzing variations of facial images for face&#xD;
           recognition may be applicable. The method can decouple variations due to different&#xD;
           people and variations due to illumination and view point.&#xD;
&#xD;
           To enhance the accuracy of analysis, multiple normal reference models may be required&#xD;
           for the patients in different ethnic groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Visualization of 3D Models&#xD;
&#xD;
           Generic visualization tools do not discriminate between the nasal bones and other&#xD;
           craniofacial bones. It is difficult and inconvenient to use them to visualize only the&#xD;
           nasal structure. So, a software tool will be developed to visualize the nasal structure&#xD;
           of the fractured models. It can also be used to visualize the registration of the&#xD;
           fractured models with the normal reference and other fracture analysis results.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Classification of Fracture Patterns&#xD;
&#xD;
      After detecting and measuring the fractured bones, the fractured models can be classified&#xD;
      according to their fracture patterns. This can be accomplished manually with the assistance&#xD;
      of classification software.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subsequently,&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Refinement of Nonlinear Registration Method&#xD;
&#xD;
           Refinement of the nonlinear registration method will be performed to improve its&#xD;
           accuracy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Biomechanical studies&#xD;
&#xD;
      Three dimensional finite element models of the nose, in particular the septum will be&#xD;
      constructed from the CT scans. Finite element analysis will be carried out to assess the&#xD;
      deformation, stress wave propagation and stress distribution in the nasal structures. Flow&#xD;
      simulation using computational fluid dynamics will also be carried out to assess the flow&#xD;
      pattern in the nasal cavity due to the nasal fracture.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Finally,&#xD;
&#xD;
      1. Biomechanical studies&#xD;
&#xD;
      Three dimensional finite element models of the nose with various proposed techniques for the&#xD;
      correction of nasal fracture will be carried out to assess the strength and weakness of the&#xD;
      resulting nasal structures due to the corrective surgical procedure. Computation fluid&#xD;
      dynamics will also be carried out to assess the flow pattern or nasal patency of the airway&#xD;
      after the proposed surgical corrections.&#xD;
