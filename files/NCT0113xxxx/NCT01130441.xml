    <textblock>
      Incarcerated adolescents engage in suicide ideation, self-harming behaviors and have poor&#xD;
      coping abilities, suggesting a need for mental health intervention and treatment. Previous&#xD;
      research on self-harm among community adolescents revealed that self-harmers were more likely&#xD;
      than non-self-harmers to report suicidal ideation, and having made a suicide plan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study plans to evaluate the suicidal intent of self-harming and non-self harming&#xD;
      adolescent admitted at juvenile detention house in Taiwan. Furthermore, this study also plans&#xD;
      to identify the prevalence and types of self-harming activities of incarcerated youths.&#xD;
      Another purpose is to investigate the coping abilities of incarcerated youth, with evaluation&#xD;
      of efficacy of short problem-solving skills therapy intervention by trained psychologists of&#xD;
      three sessions for adolescents with poor coping adjustment; referral to adolescent&#xD;
      psychiatrist when severe mental disorder or poor coping abilities were found.&#xD;
&#xD;
      By analyzing their suicidal ideation, self-harming behaviors, and coping adjustment, the&#xD;
      investigators will be able to give timely intervention and identify effective means and&#xD;
      methods for better serving this population. This study hopes to help the incarcerated youth&#xD;
      to replace their self-destructive behaviors with effective coping adjustment abilities.&#xD;

      Suicide among youth ranked third in Taiwan. According to a study by Lin, stressors include&#xD;
      family, school and friends. Psychiatric symptoms also played a role (Lin, 2002) .&#xD;
      Incarcerated adolescents with poor coping adjustment will be referred to psychologists. The&#xD;
      psychologists were trained by the juvenile detention adolescent psychiatrist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Taiwanese adolescents have very high rate of self-harming activities, furthermore,&#xD;
      incarcerated adolescents are expected to have a higher rate of self-harming activities. There&#xD;
      are few studies done on self-harming activities, suicidal intent and coping style of&#xD;
      incarcerated youth in Taiwan. According to a study on self-harming adolescents in a juvenile&#xD;
      correctional facility, these youth have higher rates of suicide attempts and use more violent&#xD;
      methods of attempt than adolescents in the general population (Penn, 2003). They also have&#xD;
      poor problem-solving skills. We hope to study their suicidal ideations, self-harming&#xD;
      behaviors, and coping styles in order to offer appropriate and timely intervention. We can&#xD;
      then offer skills to deal with similar triggering events in the future.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Furthermore, it is hoped that recidivism can be reduced after psychopathological&#xD;
      intervention.&#xD;
