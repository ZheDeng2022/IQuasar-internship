  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this clinical trial is to study the therapeutic effect of tetrabenazine MR in&#xD;
      children with Tourette's Syndrome, as measured by the improvement in total tic score of the&#xD;
      Yale Global Tic Severity Scale (YGTSS).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Tourette's Syndrome (TS) is typically diagnosed in early childhood (6-7 years) or before the&#xD;
      age of 21 years and is characterized by chronic, intermittent motor and phonic tics. There is&#xD;
      a body of evidence, mostly from the clinical experience data, suggesting the efficacy of&#xD;
      tetrabenazine in TS patients with tics, including patients who were unresponsive to other&#xD;
      treatment options. These publications consistently report the usefulness of tetrabenazine as&#xD;
      an alternative to conventional neuroleptics for the treatment of TS.&#xD;
