      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Pazopanib, a drug that inhibits the growth of new blood vessels in tumors, was recently&#xD;
      approved by the Food and Drug Administration to treat advanced kidney cancer in adults.&#xD;
      Pazopanib has been used in only a small number of adults, and more research is needed on&#xD;
      whether it is safe and effective to use in children. Researchers are interested in&#xD;
      determining safe and effective treatment doses of pazopanib in children, and in other studies&#xD;
      will examine which form of pazopanib treatment (tablet or liquid) is most effective and well&#xD;
      tolerated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine a safe and effective dose of pazopanib to treat solid tumors in children.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To study the effects of pazopanib on blood cells, blood flow, and human development.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Children, adolescents, and young adults between 1 and 21 years of age who have been&#xD;
      diagnosed with solid tumors that have not responded to treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Eligible participants will be screened with a physical examination, blood and tumor&#xD;
           samples, and imaging studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will receive pazopanib tablets for 28-day cycles of treatment. Pazopanib&#xD;
           should be taken on an empty stomach, at least 1hour before or 2 hours after a meal.&#xD;
           Participants may receive pazopanib for up to 24 cycles unless the tumor does not respond&#xD;
           or participants develop serious side effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood samples will be taken on days 1, 15, 22, and 27 of the first cycle of pazopanib,&#xD;
           with additional samples taken every 8 weeks during subsequent cycles.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  An optional part of the study will collect additional blood samples at regular intervals&#xD;
           for 24 hours after the first dose of pazopanib and at regular intervals after another&#xD;
           dose during the second or third week of the first treatment cycle.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pazopanib is a potent and selective multi-target receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor of&#xD;
           vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) receptors (VEGFR)-1, -2, and -3, c-kit and&#xD;
           platelet derived growth factor (PDGF) receptors-alpha and -beta.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Preclinical experiments demonstrate that pazopanib causes significant and dose-dependent&#xD;
           inhibitory effects on cell proliferation and inhibition of VEGF-induced VEGFR-2&#xD;
           phosphorylation, growth inhibition of a variety of human tumor xenografts in mice, and&#xD;
           inhibition of basic fibroblast growth factor-(bFGF) and VEGF-induced angiogenesis in&#xD;
           murine models.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pazopanib has been evaluated in adult subjects with solid tumors in Phase I and II&#xD;
           studies, and objective anti-tumor activity has been observed in a variety of tumor&#xD;
           types.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To estimate maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and/or recommended Phase II dose of oral&#xD;
           pazopanib administered on a once daily schedule to children with refractory solid&#xD;
           tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To define the toxicities of oral pazopanib administered as either a tablet or&#xD;
           suspension.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To characterize the pharmacokinetics of oral pazopanib in children with refractory solid&#xD;
           tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To preliminarily define the antitumor and biologic activity of oral pazopanib, and to&#xD;
           explore the changes in tumor vascular permeability following initiation of pazopanib.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To preliminarily assess VEGF haplotype/phenotype relationships in children with cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To explore pazopanib concentration-effect relationships with biomarkers and with&#xD;
           clinical outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Part 1 (Phase I Dose Escalation) and 2a (Suspension Formulation Component):&#xD;
&#xD;
           --Patients greater than 12 months and less than or equal to 21 years of age with&#xD;
           measureable or evaluable relapsed or refractory solid tumors including CNS tumors with&#xD;
           histologic verification except in patients with intrinsic brain stem tumors, optic&#xD;
           pathway gliomas, or patients with pineal tumors and elevation of tumor markers.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Part 2b (Expanded Imaging Cohort):&#xD;
&#xD;
           --Patients greater than 2 years and less than or equal to 25 years of age with&#xD;
           histologically verified relapsed or refractory soft tissue sarcoma, desmoplastic small&#xD;
           round cell tumor or extraosseus Ewing sarcoma with measurable disease (greater than or&#xD;
           equal to 2 cm) in the head, neck, extremity or fixed within the thorax, abdomen or&#xD;
           pelvis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Performance score: Karnofsky greater than or equal to 50% for patients 16 years of age;&#xD;
           Lansky greater than or equal to 50 for patients less than or equal to 16 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Must have fully recovered from acute toxic effects from all prior therapy which have&#xD;
           been completed within the specified prior time frame. Have adequate organ function as&#xD;
           determined by laboratory evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  This is a rolling six phase I trial design of pazopanib administered orally once daily&#xD;
           continuously on a 28 day cycle.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Therapy may continue for up to 24 cycles in the absence of progressive disease or&#xD;
           unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Part 1 is the phase I dose escalation portion (Completed). Once the MTD or phase II&#xD;
           recommended dose is defined, up to 16 additional patients will enroll in Part 2a to&#xD;
           obtain safety and pharmacokinetic data for the suspension formulation. In addition, up&#xD;
           to 10 patients with recurrent/refractory soft tissue sarcoma and a measurable lesion&#xD;
           will be enrolled in Part 2b at the MTD or recommended Phase II dose to further explore&#xD;
           changes in tumor vascular permeability using dynamic contrast enhanced MRI.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participation in correlative biology studies or pharmacokinetic studies will be optional&#xD;
           in Part 1; pharmacokinetic studies will be required in Part 2a; and imaging and limited&#xD;
           pharmacokinetic sampling will be required in Part 2b.&#xD;
