  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The patients are being offered a stem cell transplant. Stem cells are very early blood cells.&#xD;
      They have not yet matured to become red or white blood cells or platelets. They have already&#xD;
      received the standard treatment of chemotherapy and an autologous stem cell transplant. An&#xD;
      autologous stem cell transplant is when the patient receives their infusion of their own&#xD;
      cells. Thi will give the patient a better chance of curing the disease, this protocol&#xD;
      includes an infusion of stem cells from the blood (or the bone marrow) of another person.&#xD;
      This is called an allogeneic stem cell transplant. The stem cells will begin to grow in the&#xD;
      bone marrow and produce new blood cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Allogeneic stem cell transplants can cause a condition called graft-versus-host disease or&#xD;
      GVHD. In GVHD, a kind of white blood cell from the donor (graft) begins to attack the body&#xD;
      (host). That blood cell is called a T-cell. It is a cell that normally helps to protects&#xD;
      against things like bacteria and viruses. In this case, the donor's T-cells see the body as&#xD;
      foreign in the same way they would see bacteria as foreign. GVHD can be fatal. In order to&#xD;
      lower the chance that the patient will get GVHD this protocol treatment will remove the&#xD;
      T-cells from the donor's cells. This is called T-cell depletion. The T cells are removed by a&#xD;
      system called &quot;Clinimacs&quot;. This method is still being evaluated through clinical trials and&#xD;
      not been approved by the Federal Drug Administration (FDA) at this time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before the transplant, the physician will treat the bone marrow to get rid of the cancer. The&#xD;
      physician uses three chemotherapy drugs plus ATG. The chemotherapy drugs (Busulfan, Melphalan&#xD;
      and Fludarabine) kills the cancer. ATG gets rid of any of the patients T cells that survive&#xD;
      the chemotherapy. This ensures that the donor stem cells are not rejected. The patient will&#xD;
      also receive additional white blood cells called lymphocytes from the donor. This is called a&#xD;
      donor lymphocyte infusion or DLI. These additional infusions will help cause a&#xD;
      graft-versus-myeloma effect and can help the donor stem cells grow.&#xD;

    <description>Patients will be cytoreduced with IV busulfan, melphalan and fludarabine. Busulfan will be administered at a dose of 0.8mg/Kg q6hrs for 10 doses on days -9, -8, -7. Doses for busulfan should be adjusted according to pharmacokinetic studies. Melphalan will be administered at a dose of 70 mg/m2/day for 2 days on days -7, -6. Fludarabine will be administered at a dose of 25 mg/m2/day for 5 days on days -6, -5, -4, -3, -2. Patients will also receive rabbit anti-thymocyte globulin (ATG) to prevent immune mediated graft rejection. The ATG will be administered at a dose of 2.5 mg/Kg/day IV on days -3 and -2. Doses for busulfan, melphalan and ATG should be adjusted if patient is &gt; 125% ideal body weight and should be calculated on adjusted ideal body weight.</description>
