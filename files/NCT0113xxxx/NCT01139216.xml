  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the dose-related effects of TU-100, a botanical agent&#xD;
      that modulates gastrointestinal nerves, on rectal compliance, rectal sensation thresholds and&#xD;
      small bowel and colonic transit in female patients with functional constipation as compared&#xD;
      to placebo.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Meet Rome III criteria for functional constipation&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Willing and able to provide written informed consent&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Females, not pregnant or not breast-feeding&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Females of childbearing potential must use an acceptable form of contraception&#xD;
                  during the study and for 30 days after the last dose. Acceptable methods include&#xD;
                  surgical sterilization, hormonal contraceptives (such as oral contraceptives,&#xD;
                  Depo-Provera, Nuva Ring, condoms used with a spermicide, an IUD or abstinence.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Females are not considered to be of childbearing potential if they are&#xD;
                  postmenopausal for at least two years or have been surgically sterilized.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Ages 18 to 65 years old inclusive&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. A body mass index (BMI) between 18 and 40 kg/m2 inclusive&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. A negative urine drug screen at Visit 1&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Normal or not clinically significant laboratory results as reviewed by the study&#xD;
             physicians&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. A normal rectal exam result on file within the past 2 years or performed at Visit 1 in&#xD;
             order to exclude the possibility of an evacuation disorder. Examination must exclude&#xD;
             findings suggestive of an evacuation disorder such as high sphincter tone at rest,&#xD;
             failure of perineal descent and spasm, tenderness or paradoxical contraction of the&#xD;
             puborectalis muscles.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Do not have sufficient criteria for irritable bowel syndrome (IBS)&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Structural or metabolic diseases/conditions that affect the gastrointestinal system or&#xD;
             functional gastrointestinal disorders other than constipation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Taking any medication that in the opinion of the principal investigator has a&#xD;
             potential to alter GI transit. This includes but is not limited to osmotic or&#xD;
             stimulant laxatives, magnesium or aluminum-containing antacids, prokinetics,&#xD;
             erythromycin, narcotics, anticholinergics, selective norepinephrine reuptake&#xD;
             inhibitors (SNRIs), opiates, GABAergic agents and benzodiazepines.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Note: Tricyclic antidepressants are permissible at doses equal to or less than 25&#xD;
                  mg daily; selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) antidepressants are&#xD;
                  permissible at low, stable doses. Analgesics such as Tylenol, ibuprofen, naproxen&#xD;
                  and aspirin are permissible. All medications shall be reviewed by the principal&#xD;
                  investigator on a case by case basis.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Rescue medications: Rescue medications shall be reviewed and approved as&#xD;
                  necessary for exacerbation of constipation as the study medication treatment&#xD;
                  period is lengthy, about 28 days total. The patient will contact the study staff&#xD;
                  to request review and approval of the use of a rescue medication by the principal&#xD;
                  investigator. The use of the rescue medication will be documented by the patient&#xD;
                  in the bowel pattern diary. Rescue medications are not allowed within 7 days of&#xD;
                  the abbreviated baseline or the full transit scintigraphy to ensure data&#xD;
                  integrity.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Clinical evidence, including but not limited to a clinically significant abnormal&#xD;
             physical exam or laboratory test result or a past event documented in the past medical&#xD;
             record, or current clinically significant abnormal physical exam or laboratory test&#xD;
             result that could indicate significant cardiovascular, respiratory, renal, hepatic,&#xD;
             gastrointestinal, hematological, neurological, psychiatric or other diseases that&#xD;
             interfere with the objectives of the study. If a laboratory test result is abnormal&#xD;
             and clinically significant, it may be repeated once at the discretion of the principal&#xD;
             investigator. If the laboratory test result remains abnormal and clinically&#xD;
             significant, the patient will be discontinued from the study and referred to a primary&#xD;
             care physician for evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Patients who are considered to be alcoholics not in remission or known substance&#xD;
             abusers.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Patients who have participated in another clinical study in the past 30 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Patients who have a history of allergic reactions to egg, ginseng, ginger or Sichuan&#xD;
             pepper&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Patients who are clinically lactose intolerant&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Patients must agree to avoid alcohol during the days of Visits 5, 6 and 7 to avoid&#xD;
             corrupting the data from the anorectal manometry and rectal barostat tests.&#xD;
