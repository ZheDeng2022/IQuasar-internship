  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to better understand how the Spinal Cord Stimulator works in&#xD;
      relieving chronic pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators are asking subject to take part in this study because who are chronic pain&#xD;
      patients who already have a Spinal Cord Stimulator (SCS) in place.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that chronic pain patients will have higher heat pain threshold&#xD;
      and heat pain tolerance over the painful areas with the SCS on.&#xD;
&#xD;
      QST (Quantitative Sensory Testing, a heat/cold simulation test) might be an objective helpful&#xD;
      tool for prudent patient selection for an expensive and invasive procedure for future SCS&#xD;
      placement.&#xD;

      Sixty subjects who already have an implanted SCS device for pain management at the MGH Center&#xD;
      for Pain Medicine and other Partners affiliated pain centers will be enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Subject is 18 years or older.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Subject has an SCS device implanted for at least one month for pain control. This&#xD;
           requirement is set to ensure that the subject becomes familiarized with the therapy and&#xD;
           has recovered from the surgical implantation of the SCS device.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Subject has neurological disease or a condition causing sensory deficit to the painful&#xD;
           area.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Subject had recent therapy that may influence QST results, e.g., neuroablative procedure&#xD;
           within two-months.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Subjects who are unable to travel to the study center.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It will be a one time outpatient visit study, which will include the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Brief pain history and Neurological examination&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Medical History (including medication use);&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Pain location, intensity, character and if known, etiology, duration;&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Maps of pain locations and paresthesia locations;&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Sensory neurological examination (e.g., alcohol swab, cotton swab, pinprick and&#xD;
                vibration);&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  A check on routine vital signs (blood pressure, pulse, pulse oximetry).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. QST will include the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Warm sensation, heat pain threshold, heat pain tolerance and wind-up. A cut-off of&#xD;
                53°C for heat will be preset to avoid tissue damage.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  QST will be done on two areas; painful area and non-painful area without&#xD;
                paresthesia with the SCS turned off.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Subject will then turn on SCS and a repeat QST will be performed on the painful and&#xD;
                non-painful areas.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  QST tests will be performed in a quiet room at temperature 25º 2° C. The time and&#xD;
                duration of the QST tests will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      QST will be performed at least 4 hours and no later than 6 hours after the last dose of long&#xD;
      acting opioid and after last SCS on time. In this way the investigators will try to avoid&#xD;
      recording possible end dose withdrawal and provide sufficient time for the subject to return&#xD;
      to baseline for their SCS therapy.&#xD;

    <measure>Warm Sensation (WS) Threshold- Pain Site</measure>
    <time_frame>WS threshold is assessed once at Visit 1</time_frame>
    <description>WS threshold is a type of Quantitative Sensory Test (QST). A contact thermode was attached to the subject's painful area that has SCS coverage. The thermode increased by 1°C/sec from a baseline of 32°C. Subjects were instructed to stop stimulation when they first perceived a warm sensation. Subjects performed this test with their SCS off and again with their SCS on.</description>

    <description>Heat Pain threshold is a type of QST. A contact thermode was attached to the subject's painful area that has SCS coverage. The thermode increased by 1°C/sec from a baseline of 32°C. Subjects were instructed to stop the stimulation when pain was no longer tolerable. Subjects performed this test with their SCS off and again with their SCS on.</description>
