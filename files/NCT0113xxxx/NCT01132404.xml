  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The phase 1 portion of this study is an open-label, multicenter, dose-escalation study of&#xD;
      1-month depot TAK-448 in adult males with prostate cancer who are either on gonadotropin&#xD;
      releasing hormone (GnRH) therapy or who might be eligible for GnRH therapy in the future. The&#xD;
      phase 2 portion of this study is an open-label, multicenter, randomized study in men with&#xD;
      prostate cancer that will confirm the testosterone- and prostate specific antigen (PSA)-&#xD;
      lowering potential of up to 2 dose levels of 1-month depot TAK-448.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Each patient must meet all of the following inclusion criteria to be enrolled in the study:&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Histologically-confirmed adenocarcinoma of the prostate having completed primary local&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Meet all laboratory evaluation values at screening as specified in protocol&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  For phase 1 of the study only: Concurrent gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH)&#xD;
             therapy with generally indolent or stable disease OR a potential candidate of GnRH at&#xD;
