  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Thalidomide-Dexamethasone (TD) is a standard induction therapy for Multiple Myeloma (MM). The&#xD;
      present study is designed to compare TD with VELCADE-Thalidomide-Dexamethasone (VTD) as&#xD;
      induction therapy in preparation for, and as consolidation after, melphalan-based double&#xD;
      autologous stem cell transplantation for previously untreated patients aged ≤65 years with&#xD;
      symptomatic MM. Primary study endpoint is the rate of complete response (CR) plus&#xD;
      near-complete response (nCR) to induction treatment. Secondary endpoints include the rate of&#xD;
      CR plus nCR to double transplantation and subsequent consolidation therapy, time to&#xD;
      progression (TTP), progression-free survival (PFS),overall survival (OS) and toxicity profile&#xD;
      of both VTD and TD.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This prospective phase 3 trial is aimed at evaluating whether, in comparison with standard&#xD;
      TD, addition of Velcade to TD increases rate of CR and nCR from 15% to 30%, respectively. For&#xD;
      this purpose, symptomatic patients aged 18-65 years with previously untreated MM and&#xD;
      quantifiable M-protein in serum or urine are randomized (1:1) to receive induction therapy&#xD;
      comprising three 3-week cycles of Velcade 1.3 mg/sqm, days 1, 4, 8, 11, thalidomide 100 mg,&#xD;
      days 1-14, cycle 1, then 200 mg daily, and dexamethasone 40 mg, days 1, 2, 4, 5, 8, 9, 11,&#xD;
      12, or thalidomide and dexamethasone (same schedule and dosage as in VTD). Randomization to&#xD;
      VTD or TD is stratified according to International Staging System disease stage at diagnosis.&#xD;
      Following induction therapy, patients in both arms receive cyclophosphamide (4 g/sqm, day 0&#xD;
      and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor, 10 μcg/kg/day, from day +2) to collect autologous&#xD;
      peripheral blood stem cells (minimum threshold CD34+ cells: 4 x 10^6/kg) and two subsequent&#xD;
      courses of stem cell-supported high dose melphalan (200 mg/sqm), 3 to 6 months apart. Upon&#xD;
      neutrophil (≥1 x 10^9/L) and platelet (≥75 x 10^9/L) recovery following the first&#xD;
      autotransplantation, patients receive thalidomide (100 mg daily) and dexamethasone (40 mg,&#xD;
      days 1-4 every 4 weeks) as bridge therapy until the day before the second transplantation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients initially randomized to receive VTD or TD induction therapy are planned to receive&#xD;
      two 5-week cycles of VTD (Velcade 1.3 mg/sqm, days 1, 8, 15, 22; thalidomide 100 mg daily;&#xD;
      dexamethasone 40 mg, days 1, 2, 8, 9, 15, 16, 22, 23) or TD (thalidomide 100 mg daily;&#xD;
      dexamethasone 40 mg, days 1-4 and 20-23) as consolidation therapy, starting 3 months after&#xD;
      last transplant. Maintenance therapy comprise dexamethasone 40 mg, days 1-4, repeated monthly&#xD;
      until relapse or progression.&#xD;
