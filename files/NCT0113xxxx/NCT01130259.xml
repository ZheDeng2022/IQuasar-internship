  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The following trial is designed to offer pre-approval drug access to iniparib in combination&#xD;
      with gemcitabine and carboplatin in order to provide potential clinical benefit to patients&#xD;
      with ER-, PR-, and HER2-negative metastatic breast cancer. This follows an ongoing Phase 3,&#xD;
      multi-center, open-label, randomized study of gemcitabine/carboplatin, with or without&#xD;
      iniparib, in patients with ER-, PR-, and HER2-negative metastatic breast cancer (protocol&#xD;
      20090301).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on data generated by BiPar/Sanofi, it is concluded that iniparib does not possess&#xD;
      characteristics typical of the PARP inhibitor class. The exact mechanism has not yet been&#xD;
      fully elucidated, however based on experiments on tumor cells performed in the laboratory,&#xD;
      iniparib is a novel investigational anti-cancer agent that induces gamma-H2AX (a marker of&#xD;
      DNA damage) in tumor cell lines, induces cell cycle arrest in the G2/M phase in tumor cell&#xD;
      lines, and potentiates the cell cycle effects of DNA damaging modalities in tumor cell lines.&#xD;
      Investigations into potential targets of iniparib and its metabolites are ongoing.&#xD;
