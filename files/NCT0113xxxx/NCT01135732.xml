      PROTOCOL&#xD;
&#xD;
      Introduction: The introduction of endoscopic retrograde cholangio-pancreatography (ERCP) and&#xD;
      endoscopic sphincterotomy (ES) in 1974 has dramatically changed the treatment of biliary and&#xD;
      pancreatic diseases. ES permits transection of Oddi's sphincter, allowing the endoscopist to&#xD;
      remove stones and place stents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main indications for ERCP are: 1. Removal of common bile duct stones 2. Dilation of&#xD;
      benign biliary ducts strictures 3. Stent placement in patients with malignancy 4. Acute&#xD;
      biliary pancreatitis 5. Removal of stones and dilation of strictures of the main pancreatic&#xD;
      duct in patients with chronic pancreatitis and 6. Treatment of biliary fistulae after&#xD;
      surgical operations .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Complications of ES can be described as early (within one month after ES) and late. Early&#xD;
      complications have approximately a 10% incidence and include: 1.acute pancreatitis (5,4%)&#xD;
      2.bleeding (2%) 3.acute cholangitis (1%) 4.acute cholecystitis (0,5%) 5. Perforation and&#xD;
      others (1,1%). Late complications are mainly the recurrence of choledocholithiasis (2,5%),&#xD;
      narrowing of the previous ES and recurrent acute cholangitis. Furthermore, there is a debate&#xD;
      in the literature about late development of cholangiocarcinoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Carcinogenesis after surgical sphincteroplasty and biliary-enteric anastomosis has been&#xD;
      described. Previous studies have shown late development of cholangiocarcinoma after&#xD;
      transduodenal sphincteroplasty and biliary-enteric anastomosis for benign disease. The&#xD;
      incidence is up to 7% in a twenty-year follow up, while in the general population is&#xD;
      approximately 1/ 100.000 . In addition, Tocchi et al showed that the rate of&#xD;
      cholangiocarcinoma after transduodenal sphincteroplasty and choledochoduodenal anastomosis is&#xD;
      up to 5-7% and after other choledochi-enteric anastomoses approximately 1,9%. It seems that&#xD;
      the ablation of sphincter function causes prolonged pancreatobiliary and duodenobiliary&#xD;
      reflux. Proteolytic pancreatic enzymes are activated and bacterial intestinal flora colonizes&#xD;
      the biliary epithelium, causing recurrent inflammation. Chronic inflammatory irritation may&#xD;
      lead to hyperplasia, dysplasia and atypia of epithelium, ultimately inducing carcinogenesis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eleftheriadis et al, studied changes of the biliary epithelium in patients who underwent&#xD;
      choledochi-duodenal anastomosis for benign disease, and hyperplasia of the biliary epithelium&#xD;
      was demonstrated. The same results and atypia of biliary epithelium were reported by Kurumado&#xD;
      et al, in mice models with choledochi-duodenal anastomosis. Anomalous pancreatobiliary&#xD;
      junction and choledochal cysts produce the same histologic alterations of the biliary&#xD;
      epithelium.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These facts raise a great amount of concern about late development of cancer after ES.&#xD;
      Bergman et al in a small trial argues that after ES, the function of the biliary sphincter is&#xD;
      permanently lost. On the other hand, Sugiyama et al demonstrated the reduction of&#xD;
      pancreatobiliary reflux 1 year after ES. In addition, large population-based studies have&#xD;
      shown no causal association between ES and cholangiocarcinoma, but with enough limitations in&#xD;
      study design. In conclusion, the long term cytologic changes of the biliary epithelium after&#xD;
      ES for benign disease are not well known.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During ERCP, brush cytology can be performed to evaluate bile duct strictures. The use of&#xD;
      endoscopic brushing after ES has no reported complications .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: To evaluate cytologic alterations of the biliary epithelium after previous&#xD;
      endoscopic sphincterotomy for benign disease.&#xD;

      Informed consent will be obtained from all patients. ERCP will be conducted at the Endoscopic&#xD;
      Unit of Aretaieion University Hospital and Tzaneio General Hospital, Athens, Greece.&#xD;
      Pethidine, midazolam or propofol will be used for patient sedation. ERCP will be conducted&#xD;
      with the use of a side viewing endoscope. After catheterization of the common bile duct&#xD;
      through the previous sphincterotomy, cellular material will be obtained with the use of an&#xD;
      endoscopic brush from the bile ducts. With the same way, brush cytology will be performed in&#xD;
      the control group after performing ES.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Material obtained from each patient will be smeared on five glass slides. Four slides will be&#xD;
      fixed with ethanol solution 95% and the fifth will be air dried. The brush will be fixed in&#xD;
      suitable liquid for performing liquid phase cytology. Immunocytology with immunofluorescence&#xD;
      p-53 antibody will be performed in samples with hyperplasia, dysplasia or atypia. The&#xD;
      cytology department of Tzaneio Hospital will conduct examination and evaluation of all&#xD;
      samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Samples based on their morphological characteristics will be classified in five categories:&#xD;
      a. inadequate sample (very small cell number, presence of blood, inadequate fixation) b.&#xD;
      negative for malignancy (adequate cell number with benign morphologic characteristics) c.&#xD;
      reactive with or without atypia (cells with reactive/proliferative or inflammatory&#xD;
      characteristics. Malignancy is rare but cannot be excluded) d. suspicious for malignancy e.&#xD;
      positive for malignancy [21,22].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Examination and evaluation of the specimens will be done by two specialized cytologists,&#xD;
      separately, in order to achieve more objective results.&#xD;
