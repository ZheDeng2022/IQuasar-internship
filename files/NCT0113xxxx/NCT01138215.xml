      VZV causes two clinical diseases, primary infection results in varicella (chickenpox) after&#xD;
      which virus latent in dorsal root ganglion. Reactivation of VZV results in herpes zoster&#xD;
      (shingles) about years or decades. Immunocompetent children, varicella generally mild self&#xD;
      limiting illness. In HIV infected children, VZV is often more severe illness with progressive&#xD;
      varicella characterized by continuing eruption of lesions and high fever persist into second&#xD;
      weeks, as well as encephalitis, hepatitis and pneumonia can developed. Zoster in&#xD;
      immunocompromised patient become disseminated with lesions appearing outsides primary&#xD;
      dermatomes and with visceral complications and can cause recurrences of herpes zoster. VZV&#xD;
      illness in patients with immunodeficiency disorders require admission to hospital and the use&#xD;
      of antiviral drugs. Sometimes, antiviral drug fails in immunocompromised children. Passive&#xD;
      immunization with varicella zoster-immunoglobulin (VZIG), administered within three days of&#xD;
      exposure, is effective in preventing disease or in reducing severity of illness in&#xD;
      susceptible immunocompromised persons. About half of the cases of varicella in&#xD;
      immunocompromised children occur without a recognised exposure to VZV. Both severe and fatal&#xD;
      varicella has been documented despite appropriate immunoprophylaxis withVZIG. Furthermore,&#xD;
      VZIG is expensive and short supply. These limitations make passive immunization a less than&#xD;
      optimum strategy for preventing chickenpox. Permanent protection provided by administering&#xD;
      the vaccine to high-risk persons would be preferable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sartori AM., University of Sao Paolo in Sep 2004 found that after give two doses of the&#xD;
      varicella vaccine in 41 susceptible HIV-infected childrens in CDC class N1 or A1.&#xD;
      Seroconversion occurred in 53% and 60% of vaccines after one and two doses, respectively. No&#xD;
      significant fall in CD4 T lymphocytes or increase in HIV viral load at eight weeks after&#xD;
      vaccination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Saro H. Armenian, University of Southern California in Nov 2005 administrated single dose of&#xD;
      live varicella vaccine to 10 HIV infected children. After vaccination, positive VZV-LPA&#xD;
      response was detected in 50% of patients at week 2 and 100% at week 4, remained positive in&#xD;
      90% at week 52. VZV IgG was detected in 11% at week 2, 67% at week 8, only 33% at week 52.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Myron J. Levin, University of Colorado in June 2006-2008 study about the safety and&#xD;
      immunogenicity of vaccine in varicella-zoster virus (VZV) naive, HIV-infected children with&#xD;
      moderate symptoms and/or more pronounced past or current decreases in CD4+ T cell counts.&#xD;
      Recipients (97 children) were stratified into 3 groups : group I - CDC category 1 and&#xD;
      immunologic category 1 (least affected group of HIV-infected children), group II - CDC&#xD;
      category A, B, or N and immunologic category 2 (CD4% = 15-24), group III : CDC category C&#xD;
      and/or immunologic category 3, but at least 3 months prior to vaccination, had achieved&#xD;
      clinical category A or N and equivalent of immunologic category 1 (CD4% = 25). After 2 doses&#xD;
      of vaccines , 79% of children developed VZV-specific antibody and/or CMI 2 months after&#xD;
      vaccine and 83% were responders 1 year after vaccination. Bekker V., Emma Children's&#xD;
      Hospital, Netherland in Nov 2006 administered 2 doses of varicella vaccine to 15&#xD;
      VZV-seronegative HIV-1 infected children (total lymphocyte counts &gt; 700 lymphocytes/microl)&#xD;
      and 6 HIV-negative VZV-seronegative. Only 60% of the HIV-1 infected children had VZV-specific&#xD;
      Ab after two immunizations, where as 100% of the siblings seroconverted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thai HIV infected children usually start antiretroviral late due to limited access to care&#xD;
      with more severe suppressed of immune status than children in developed countries. Moreover,&#xD;
      VZV vaccine is not in the country guideline and still expensive. We would like to provide VZV&#xD;
      prevention for this group of children and to evaluate the VZV antibody response in Thai HIV&#xD;
      children after VZV vaccination.&#xD;
