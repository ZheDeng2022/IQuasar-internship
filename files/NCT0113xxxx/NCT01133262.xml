  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We have developed a prototype PET insert device that can be integrated into a clinical&#xD;
      PET/computed tomography (CT) scanner to improve its image resolution to approximately 2.5 mm&#xD;
      in all 3 dimensions within a reduced imaging field of view (FOV). This zoom-in imaging&#xD;
      capability provides 6-fold improvement in volumetric image resolution over the current&#xD;
      state-of-the-art clinical PET scanner, offering a tremendous opportunity for cancer imaging&#xD;
      applications, in particular for those cases where a lymph node involvement will drastically&#xD;
      alter the patient management plan. Accurate diagnosis and staging of head-and-neck cancer is&#xD;
      known to be challenging because of the complex anatomy and large number of lymph nodes&#xD;
      involved in this region. As a result, head and neck cancer imaging is an ideal candidate for&#xD;
      evaluating the clinical usefulness of this novel imaging device.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this project, we propose to conduct an exploratory clinical trial to investigate the&#xD;
      effectiveness of this novel imaging device in detecting small lesions and lymph node&#xD;
      involvements in the head and neck region, and compare its results to those obtained from a&#xD;
      clinical PET/CT scanner. More specifically, we propose to (1) recruit 5 patients who have&#xD;
      confirmed head and neck cancer and are scheduled to receive a whole-body PET/CT scan followed&#xD;
      by surgical operation to remove the primary tumor and the regional lymph nodes. These&#xD;
      patients will be imaged by a state-of-the-art PET/CT scanner using the standard whole-body&#xD;
      PET/CT imaging protocol as standard of care for initial staging. On another day, following&#xD;
      consent to participate in this research protocol, A patient will undergo images of the head&#xD;
      and neck region using the same type scanner with and without our novel PET insert device&#xD;
      attached; (2) The images obtained from the PET insert device will be reviewed by experienced&#xD;
      nuclear medicine physicians to identify the extent of lymph node involvement. The PET insert&#xD;
      images will be compared to the standard clinical PET/CT images. A detailed image obtained for&#xD;
      purposes of research, centered at the level of the head and neck, acquired for approximately&#xD;
      3 times the length of time the standard clinical image is obtained for will also be compared&#xD;
      to the PET insert image. Images will also be compared to the pathology report of the&#xD;
      surgically removed specimen. (3) Estimate the performance of lesion detection for different&#xD;
      sizes of tumors using the standard PET/CT scanner as well as the PET insert device.&#xD;

  <condition>Squamous Cell Carcinoma of the Head and Neck</condition>
  <eligibility>
    <study_pop>
      <textblock>
        Patients with biopsy proven squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck with suspected&#xD;
        lymph node metastasis&#xD;

    <sampling_method>Non-Probability Sample</sampling_method>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Patients must have histologically or cytologically confirmed squamous cell carcinoma&#xD;
             of the head and neck with suspected lymph node metastasis. Subjects with histological&#xD;
             confirmation of squamous cell carcinoma from a lymph node biopsy in the head and neck&#xD;
             region for carcinoma of unknown primary would also be eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Patient must be scheduled to receive (or have already received) clinical whole body&#xD;
             PET/CT scan from a Siemens Biograph 40 PET/CT scanner as their standard of care&#xD;
             staging.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Patient must be scheduled to receive surgical removal of the primary tumor and the&#xD;
             regional lymph nodes. It is preferred that the surgery will occur within 21 days of&#xD;
             research PET imaging.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Age &gt;18 years, as head and neck cancer is extremely rare in children.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Ability of the patient (or legally authorized representative if applicable) to&#xD;
             understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Not currently pregnant or nursing: Female subjects must be either surgically sterile&#xD;
             (has had a documented bilateral oophorectomy and/or documented hysterectomy), or post&#xD;
             menopausal (cessation of menses for more than 1 year). If of childbearing potential, a&#xD;
             urine pregnancy test must be performed within the 24 hour period immediately prior to&#xD;
             administration of 18FDG and determined to be negative&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. The subject weight will be limited to 250 lbs and below due to the size limitations of&#xD;
             the prototype PET insert device.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Subjects who are claustrophobic&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Subjects with poorly controlled diabetes (fasting blood glucose &gt;200mg/dL)&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Subjects with prior head/neck surgery or radiation as this may disturb the natural&#xD;
             architecture of the tissues and impede the imaging analysis&#xD;
