  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the safety and efficacy of pomalidomide over a 12&#xD;
      week duration in the treatment of chronic cough in patients with IPF as measured by a Cough&#xD;
      Symptom Diary, Visual Analogue Scale for Cough Severity, Leicester Cough Questionnaire, St.&#xD;
      George Respiratory Questionnaire, Cough-Specific Quality-of-Life Questionnaire, and adverse&#xD;
      event reporting. There will be an option open to participants, who respond to treatment by&#xD;
      meeting pre-determined criteria, to remain in the study for an additional 9 months or for a&#xD;
      total of 54 weeks.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Chronic cough is one of the most debilitating symptoms in patients with IPF. It is estimated&#xD;
      that over 80% of patients with IPF experience clinically significant cough. The impact of&#xD;
      chronic cough on QOL includes fatigue, embarrassment, anxiety, sleep disturbance, hoarseness,&#xD;
      incontinence, dizziness, vomiting, rib fractures, and severe dyspnea. There is also some&#xD;
      evidence that chronic cough may contribute to increased airway inflammation. In IPF patients,&#xD;
      significant oxygen desaturation often accompanies coughing episodes leading to increased&#xD;
      dyspnea, anxiety, and panic. Studies examining alternative therapeutic agents for cough in&#xD;
      IPF patients are scarce. Cough in patients with IPF is typically refractory to traditional&#xD;
      antitussive agents or corticosteroids.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Unfortunately, the side effects of corticosteroids combined with their lack of efficacy in&#xD;
      prevention of disease progression in IPF makes this a less desired treatment option.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although opiates can be effective in controlling cough, issues of sedation, respiratory&#xD;
      depression and narcotic dependence are significant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an open label, safety and efficacy pilot study of pomalidomide in 20 patients with&#xD;
      IPF. This study will determine both the tolerability and feasibility of pomalidomide for the&#xD;
      treatment of cough in this patient population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible patients will be selected from our Interstitial Lung Disease Clinic database which&#xD;
      consists of patients with ILD seen in our clinic since about 2004 who have signed informed&#xD;
      consent (previously approved by our Administrative Panel on Human Subjects in Medical&#xD;
      Research, protocol 14054). Those patients with IPF who describe the severity of their cough&#xD;
      as decreasing, or adversely affecting, their quality of life will be invited to participate&#xD;
      in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SCREENING VISIT During this visit, the study will be fully reviewed with the patient, who&#xD;
      will already have received the consent form and discussed it by phone, or at a previous&#xD;
      clinic visit with the study coordinator and possibly the PI or Sub PI. At this visit the pt.&#xD;
      will undergo Informed Consent, bloodwork including Chem Panel with LFTs, CBC, History and&#xD;
      Physical Exam - MD, Vital Signs, Spirometry without Bronchodilator, Diffusion Capacity, 6&#xD;
      Minute Walk, EKG, Adverse Events, Cough Visual Analog Scale (VAS), Leicester Cough&#xD;
      Questionaire (LCQ), Cough-Specific Quality-of-Life Questionnaire (CQLQ),St. George&#xD;
      Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ), and dispensation of the Cough Symptom Diary (CSD).&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the patient continues to meet eligibility criteria, current cough suppressive agents will&#xD;
      be discontinued from days 1-14.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY DAY 1, VISIT 1 History and Physical Exam - MD, Vital Signs, Adverse Events, Cough&#xD;
      Visual Analog Scale, LCQ, CQLQ and the SGRQ. The patient will then be given a 30 day supply&#xD;
      of 2mg capsules of pomalidomide with written instructions on dosing and instructions to call&#xD;
      the study center with any adverse reactions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      WEEK 1, Visit 2 Pt. will come to study site for safety labs, and assessment of adverse events&#xD;
      and any changes in medications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      WEEK 2, VISIT 3 The patient will return to the clinic to be assessed for potential adverse&#xD;
      reactions and to have safety laboratory work done.&#xD;
&#xD;
      WEEKS 4, 8, and 12 (Visits 4, 6, and 8) The participant will return to the study center and&#xD;
      undergo physical exam, vital signs, assessment of adverse events, and self-completion of the&#xD;
      VAS, LCQ, and the CQLQ. Every two weeks (Visits 2, 4, and 6) the patient will also undergo&#xD;
      safety laboratory testing which can either be done at Stanford or at a local lab. As part of&#xD;
      routine care, we will obtain spirometry and 6MWT at the start and end of study. If there are&#xD;
      abnormalities in the patient's labs at week 2 we will either withdraw the patient from the&#xD;
      study or down-titrate their dose depending on the severity of lab abnormality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A 30 day supply of 2mg capsules of pomalidomide will be dispensed at Week 4 and 8.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patient will undergo a 2 week taper to 1 mg/day of study drug at week 12 to off drug by&#xD;
      wk. 14, and will have a return follow up visit at week 18 for assessment of adverse events,&#xD;
      history and physical exam, lab work including pregnancy test, and completion of all four&#xD;
      questionnaires.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients responding by meeting the established minimally clinically important difference for&#xD;
      the CQLQ as well as having demonstrated safety tolerance by laboratory tests and physician&#xD;
      exam and who wish to remain in the study may do so for an additional 9 months at the&#xD;
      discretion of the Protocol Director. These participants will not undergo taper at week 12 and&#xD;
      will be re-supplied on a monthly basis until week 48 at which time they will taper to off&#xD;
      drug over 2 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Visit Schedule for the extension study is the same as the initial 3 months with the&#xD;
      exception that safety laboratory blood work is done monthly instead of every two weeks.&#xD;
