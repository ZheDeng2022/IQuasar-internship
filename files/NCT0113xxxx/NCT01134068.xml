    <textblock>
      Suspected pulmonary embolism (PE) is a frequent clinical problem and remains a diagnostic&#xD;
      challenge. The diagnostic approach of PE relies on sequential diagnostic tests, such as&#xD;
      plasma D-dimer measurement, multi-slice computed tomography (MSCT) and pulmonary angiography.&#xD;
      In addition, the diagnostic workup is usually stratified according to the clinical&#xD;
      probability of pulmonary embolism. Clinical probability has a fair predictive accuracy either&#xD;
      evaluated implicitly or by clinical prediction rules1 and is useful for identifying patients&#xD;
      with a low prevalence of pulmonary embolism who can be usually fully investigated by non&#xD;
      invasive tests.The D-dimer test has been extensively evaluated in the exclusion of pulmonary&#xD;
      embolism, particularly in outpatients. ELISA D-dimer and second-generation latex&#xD;
      agglutination (immuno-turbidimetric tests) have a remarkably high sensitivity and have been&#xD;
      proved safe first-line tests in association with clinical probability to rule out pulmonary&#xD;
      embolism in outcome studies. The clinical usefulness of D-dimer is defined by the proportion&#xD;
      of patients in whom pulmonary embolism may be ruled out by a normal result and it is&#xD;
      determined by the specificity. However, ELISA and second-generation latex agglutination&#xD;
      (immuno-turbidimetric tests) tests have a quite limited overall specificity of around 35% to&#xD;
      40%. Therefore, many investigators tried to increase the D-dimer thresholds in particular in&#xD;
      elderly patients to increase the rate of patients in whom the diagnosis could be excluded by&#xD;
      this easy and inexpensive test. Several studies have shown that D-dimer levels increase with&#xD;
      age and which turns in a decreased specificity of the D-dimer test at the usual threshold in&#xD;
      the elderly, and thus to a less useful test to exclude PE in older patients. Indeed, ELISA&#xD;
      D-dimer is able to rule out PE in 60% of patients aged less than 40 years, but in only 5% of&#xD;
      patients above the age of 80.8 In this study, raising the cut-off value to various points&#xD;
      between 600 ng/ml and 1000 ng/ml increased specificity, but this came at the cost of safety&#xD;
      with more false negative test results. In this analysis, however, no stratification was made&#xD;
      for clinical probability and the sample was small.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently, the investigators retrospectively assessed the value of a progressive cut-off&#xD;
      adjusted to age in a wide sample of 1712 patients. This &quot;new&quot; cut-off was defined for D-Dimer&#xD;
      test positivity in each patient by multiplying patient's age by 10. All patients with a&#xD;
      D-Dimer level below 500mg/ml, and all patients above 50 years whose D-Dimer levels were&#xD;
      inferior to their age multiplied by 10 were considered as having a negative D-Dimer test. The&#xD;
      exact derivation and validation of this &quot;new&quot; D-dimer cut-off is described hereafter. Using&#xD;
      the conventional cutoff, the VIDAS® D-Dimer test was negative (below 500 mg/ml) in 512/1712&#xD;
      patients (29.9%) and none had PE during initial workup or the three-month follow-up period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Using the cutoff adjusted to age (cutoff for D-Dimer test positivity equals age multiplied by&#xD;
      ten, in mg/ml), the figure was as follows. D-Dimer levels were below the adjusted cutoff in&#xD;
      615/1712 patients (35.9%, number needed to test 2.8). This represented a statistically&#xD;
      significant 20.1% increase in the number of patients in whom the D-Dimer test was considered&#xD;
      as negative, p=0.0002. Of these 615 patients, 5 had PE during initial workup (0.8%, 95&#xD;
      percent confidence interval 0.4 to 1.9%).&#xD;
&#xD;
      These data suggest that adopting this progressive cut-off in patients above 50 years, could&#xD;
      increase of about 20% the number of patients in whom PE could be excluded without further&#xD;
      testing, with an acceptable safety profile as the three-month thromboembolic rate remained&#xD;
      very low.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, the investigators plan a prospective outcome study in which this progressive or&#xD;
      &quot;new&quot; cut-off (age X 10 ng/ml) in patients above 50 years will be used. In this multicentre&#xD;
      study, clinical probability will be assessed by the simplified revised Geneva revised score&#xD;
      (Table 1) and an ELISA D-dimer test will be performed [Vidas D-Dimer Exclusion® test&#xD;
      (Biomérieux, Marcy l'Etoile, Paris, France)]. Patients with a non high clinical probability&#xD;
      with the simplified revised Geneva score and a normal &quot;new&quot; D-dimer cut-off with the Vidas&#xD;
      D-dimer Exclusion®, (Biomerieux, Marcy l'Etoile, France) will be considered as not having PE,&#xD;
      and will be followed for three-months to assess possible VTE recurrences. The main outcome&#xD;
      will be the rate of thromboembolic events during a formal 3-month follow-up in patients not&#xD;
      anticoagulated on the basis of this strategy. Patients with positive D-dimers will be&#xD;
      investigated with MSCT as currently admitted.&#xD;
