  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the preliminary safety and efficacy of the daVinci&#xD;
      surgical system (computer-assisted surgery) for use in vascular surgery procedures. Although&#xD;
      the daVinci Surgical System is FDA approved and widely used for surgical procedures for&#xD;
      urology, cardiac, general, and gynecologic procedures, it is not currently approved&#xD;
      specifically for use in vascular surgery and the FDA has required the PI to conduct a small&#xD;
      feasibility study under an IDE. The investigators are seeking approval by the FDA to utilize&#xD;
      the daVinci Surgical System in vascular surgery and to conduct a future clinical trial.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with significant femoropopliteal or tibial occlusive disease not amenable to&#xD;
             catheter directed therapy (ie angioplasty/stenting). Symptoms include&#xD;
             lifestyle-limiting claudication, rest pain and/or tissue loss.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with an ABI between 0.2 and 0.8.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Femoropopliteal disease visible on color duplex ultrasound (DUS)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patent and minimally diseased common femoral and proximal superficial artery&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with American Society of Anesthesiology (ASA) I, II or III classification&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  PT/PTT, EKG, HbA1c, liver function, within normal ranges within 30 days prior to&#xD;
             procedure or stable over the last 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Current University of Chicago Medical Center Lab standards will be used. Pulmonary function&#xD;
        will be assessed as needed by preoperative anesthesia evaluation. (Generally for&#xD;
        infrainguinal procedures, pulmonary function is not assessed)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Body Mass Index (BMI) &lt;40&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Previous surgery in the inguinal region (ie: prior femoral artery dissection)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Myocardial infarction (MI) within the last 6 months&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Laboratory evidence of hypercoagulable state and/or connective tissue disease&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant women&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of non-compliance with medical care&#xD;
