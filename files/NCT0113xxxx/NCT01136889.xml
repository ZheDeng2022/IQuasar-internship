  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      1. To determine the feasibility of conducting a randomised controlled trial (RCT) of the&#xD;
           effectiveness of a PFMT intervention in conjunction with vaginal pessary management&#xD;
           versus vaginal pessary management alone for women with pelvic organ prolapse.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To develop and test the methods for a main trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The ultimate aim of a large multi-centre RCT would be to answer the question:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Is conservative management of pelvic organ prolapse with an individualised PFMT intervention&#xD;
      in conjunction with vaginal pessary more effective than vaginal pessary alone in reducing&#xD;
      prolapse-specific symptoms, prolapse severity and the need for further prolapse treatment?&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      It is hypothesised that undertaking PFMT with a pessary in place may increase the level of&#xD;
      existing muscle support in the pelvic area: by reducing the descent of the pelvic organs and&#xD;
      the consequent stretching of soft tissue the pessary may allow the pelvic floor muscles to be&#xD;
      exercised and strengthened more effectively. Potentially this could lead to additional&#xD;
      improvements in the pessary retention rate and associated prolapse symptoms beyond that&#xD;
      expected from the pessary alone. Urine, bowel and sexual function, which can be affected by&#xD;
      prolapse, may also improve independently in response to a PFMT intervention. If a more&#xD;
      permanent reduction in prolapse symptoms results from concurrent use of PFMT, this may delay&#xD;
      or prevent the need for long term pessary use or surgical intervention. In summary, a PFMT&#xD;
      intervention in combination with pessary management for vaginal prolapse may be more&#xD;
      effective in reducing symptoms and increasing quality of life than management of the prolapse&#xD;
      with a pessary alone. This study will start to provide the evidence to address this question.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a feasibility study to develop the methods for a multi-centre RCT. It will run&#xD;
      alongside The POPPY Trial (a 17 centre trial of PFMT already underway in the UK;&#xD;
      ClinicalTrials Number NCT00476892). Three of The POPPY Trial centres will be involved in this&#xD;
      feasibility study. Over a 12 month period, we plan to enrol 50 women with diagnosed prolapse&#xD;
      of stage I to IV, who are not eligible for The POPPY Trial because they require a pessary.&#xD;
      These women will be randomised into one of two groups: PFMT (delivered by a physiotherapist&#xD;
      at 5 appointments over 16 weeks) in conjunction with pessary management of their prolapse or&#xD;
      pessary management alone. All women will have a nurse appointment six months after&#xD;
      randomisation at which time their pessary will be removed. A replacement pessary will not be&#xD;
      immediately re-fitted. At seven months after randomisation all women will have a review&#xD;
      appointment with their gynaecologist to have their prolapse assessed, the pessary re-fitted&#xD;
      if necessary, and other treatment needs discussed. Women will complete postal questionnaires,&#xD;
      at baseline (prior to randomisation), at six months post-randomisation (prior to seeing the&#xD;
      nurse to have the pessary removed), and seven months post-randomisation (prior to the 7 month&#xD;
      gynaecologist review appointment), and record symptoms in a diary for one month after removal&#xD;
      of the pessary. Key outcomes are: prolapse symptoms, prolapse-related quality of life,&#xD;
      prolapse severity, and additional prolapse treatment received up to seven months after study&#xD;
      entry.&#xD;

    <description>Women allocated to the intervention group will be invited to attend 5 out-patient appointments over a 16 week period with a trained specialist women's health physiotherapist at the study centre. Women will be taught how to contract the muscles, and also how to contract and hold prior to an event that increases intra-abdominal pressure (&quot;the Knack&quot;). Tailored advice will be given on ways of reducing intra-abdominal pressure, e.g. advice on weight loss, chronic cough, heavy lifting and general exercise. A prolapse specific Lifestyle Advice sheet will also be given to the women by the physiotherapist.</description>

    <description>Women allocated to the control group will be sent a Lifestyle Advice Leaflet only. They will have no planned intervention after their pessary is fitted, other than routine pessary management according to local protocols. The Lifestyle Advice Leaflet gives instructions on seeking advice, where appropriate, about weight loss, constipation, and avoidance of heavy lifting, coughing and high impact exercise, with a view to minimising increases in intra-abdominal pressure which may cause the prolapse to worsen.</description>
