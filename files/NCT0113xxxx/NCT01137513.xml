      The purpose of this study is to measure T-Wave Alternans (TWA) in patients with acute&#xD;
      coronary syndrome. Researchers are blinded to clinical TWA measurements. The investigators&#xD;
      will then try to determine if T-Wave alternans correlates with clinical outcome of patients&#xD;
      with Acute Coronary Syndrome. During routine care of the patient, the T Wave Alternans is&#xD;
      measured.&#xD;

      III: Title: T-Wave Alternans for Acute Coronary Syndrome Patients Objective: Chest Pain is a&#xD;
      common and high-risk presenting symptom in the Emergency Department. One of the central&#xD;
      challenges Emergency Physicians face is differentiating cardiac causes of chest pain from&#xD;
      non-cardiac causes. A rich array of mature technologies exists to aid in this process. None,&#xD;
      however, has shown adequate sensitivity within the first 12-18 hours of symptoms to reliably&#xD;
      exclude cardiac ischemia. As a result many patients are admitted to Coronary Care Units for a&#xD;
      period of observation which typically involves serial blood analysis and continuous cardiac&#xD;
      monitoring. An estimated $13 billion dollars per year are devoted to this &quot;Rule-out MI&quot;&#xD;
      process. The majority, typically 80%, of these patients are ultimately found not to have&#xD;
      cardiac disease. That is, their chest pain is ascribed to gastro-esophageal reflux, or&#xD;
      esophageal or chest wall muscle spasm as an explanation for their symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While no test can reliably discriminate cardiac from non-cardiac symptoms in the emergency&#xD;
      department, a test that improves our ability to identify a subset of patients who are safe to&#xD;
      discharge would be of immense utility in reducing unnecessary hospital admissions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background: In the past 15 years T-Wave Alternans (TWA) testing has become accepted among&#xD;
      cardiac electrophysiologists as a means of identifying patients at high risk for ventricular&#xD;
      arrhythmias. TWA testing is typically performed in conjunction with a cardiac stress test and&#xD;
      involves computerized analysis of the EKG for subtle alternate beat variations in the&#xD;
      amplitude of the T-wave segment. The test is completely non-invasive, can return results&#xD;
      immediately, and can be performed with compact, portable equipment. An extensive body of&#xD;
      literature has emerged demonstrating the test's very high negative predictive value for&#xD;
      various groups of patients with regard to ventricular tachyarrhythmias and sudden cardiac&#xD;
      death. For example, Rosenbaum studied patients referred for electrophysiological testing due&#xD;
      to high clinical suspicion of risk of sudden cardiac death. His landmark paper (Electrical&#xD;
      Alternans and vulnerability to ventricular Arrhythmias, N Engl J Med 1994;330:235-41) found&#xD;
      that a positive TWA test identified a subset of patients in this group with 81% mortality&#xD;
      over 20 months versus 6% for those in whom the test was negative. The predictive value of TWA&#xD;
      testing for cardiac arrhythmia in this group was equivalent to invasive electrophysiological&#xD;
      testing. Numerous subsequent studies have corroborated these findings in specific patient&#xD;
      populations such as Post-MI patients, Congestive Heart Failure patients, and patients with&#xD;
      Syncope. TWA testing was approved (Nov 2001) for Medicare reimbursement at approximately $260&#xD;
      per test. The &quot;HearTwave System&quot; from Cambridge Heart Inc (Boston MA) gained FDA approval in&#xD;
      Apr 2001 for testing &quot;any patient at risk for ventricular arrhythmia.&quot; The test has been&#xD;
      validated in the context of traditional cardiac stress testing but there is not much clinical&#xD;
      literature on the utility of the test in other contexts. Specifically, there are no reports&#xD;
      of the applicability of TWA testing to Emergency Department patients with acute chest pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Verrier et al. (J Amer Coll Cardiol 2001; 37:1719-25) found in an animal study that emotional&#xD;
      stress had a profound multiplicative effect on the magnitude of TWA caused by cardiac&#xD;
      ischemia. This research supported the idea that the emotional stress of presenting to the&#xD;
      Emergency Department with acute chest pain or shortness of breath might be an effective&#xD;
      substitute for the stress that provocative cardiac stress tests (treadmill or pharmacologic&#xD;
      stress testing) induce. If true, then it would be of great interest to Emergency Physicians&#xD;
      to measure the predictive value of TWA for cardiac ischemia in patients who are &quot;stressed&quot; by&#xD;
      acute chest pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In 2003, we performed a preliminary study in the Loma Linda University ED to test this&#xD;
      research question. We monitored 100 acute chest pain ED patients using the HearTwave TWA&#xD;
      monitor. We determined that TWA in this setting was relatively common, and that the amplitude&#xD;
      of TWA seemed to correlate highly with the presence of cardiac ischemia. The results of this&#xD;
      work were presented at several local and one national meeting of academic Emergency&#xD;
      Physicians and were received with enthusiasm. A problem with the results was related to a&#xD;
      limitation of the HearTwave device. The HearTwave is designed for use in conjunction with an&#xD;
      exercise stress test and requires that heart rate increases over a threshold (105 beats per&#xD;
      minute) as the test proceeds. Because our recordings were done &quot;passively&quot; in patients at&#xD;
      rest, the data was inappropriate for the proprietary algorithm used by the HearTwave and so&#xD;
      our analysis required a different processing technique that was qualitative rather than&#xD;
      quantitative. Even so, we were able to demonstrate that TWA activity in patients with heart&#xD;
      rates above a much lower threshold (60 beats/minute) was 100% sensitive for cardiac ischemia&#xD;
      at a level of specificity of approximately 50%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the present proposal, we seek IRB approval for a protocol very similar to what we used&#xD;
      before. The main difference will be that we will use a device that gives us access to the raw&#xD;
      data and enable us to apply our own numerical processing algorithms to measure TWA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will look at TWA testing in an observational study of approximately 500 emergency&#xD;
      department patients presenting with symptoms suggestive of cardiac ischemia. The study will&#xD;
      be conducted at Loma Linda University Medical Center (LLUMC) an academic institution with&#xD;
      over 44,000 Emergency Department visits per year. All emergency Department patients age 18 or&#xD;
      older who are being evaluated for possible Acute Coronary Syndrome will be eligible. Actual&#xD;
      testing will be performed by medical students who will have completed a 1-hour training&#xD;
      course in the use of the electrocardiographic instrument.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: The device to be employed in the test is a an FDA approved ECG probe that enables&#xD;
      capture of the filtered ECG signal to digital storage. The testing procedure is essentially&#xD;
      identical to standard ECG recording. Ten electrodes are applied to the patient's chest in a&#xD;
      configuration that does not interfere with standard lead placement. The patient is connected&#xD;
      via electrical leads to the device and the operator presses a button to initiate the&#xD;
      measurement cycle. The complete test process typically takes 5-15 minutes. No action is&#xD;
      required by the patient or anyone else after the test is initiated. Results are stored&#xD;
      automatically for later review. The results of the test will not be made available to the&#xD;
      treating physicians and so will not influence treatment decisions. Performing the test will&#xD;
      not interfere in any way with delivery of standard acute care to the patient. Testing is&#xD;
      non-invasive - no stimulating current is delivered to the patient. The instrument is designed&#xD;
      for use with standard electrodes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following testing, patients' data will be processed in several ways. There are two standard&#xD;
      algorithms described in this literature to measure TWA - the &quot;Spectral Analysis&quot; method, and&#xD;
      the &quot;Modified Moving Average&quot; method. In addition to these two methods, we will use Neural&#xD;
      Network Techniques to further analyze the data. These methods allow quantitative&#xD;
      determination of the degree of TWA present in the data. We will examine the predictive value&#xD;
      of TWA testing for various measures of cardiac morbidity based on discharge diagnosis,&#xD;
      results of further cardiac testing, presence of ventricular arrhythmia, myocardial&#xD;
      infarction, need for revascularization. Follow-up will be made by telephone to the patient or&#xD;
      their family at 3 months post testing to assess for the occurrence of death, myocardial&#xD;
      infarction, or revascularization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The central question guiding our research is to what extent can TWA testing aid in the&#xD;
      process of early risk stratification of the acute chest pain patient. We are particularly&#xD;
      interested in the negative predictive value of the test in clinically low-risk patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Risks: Minimal risk to the patient. Benefits: Individual participants will not benefit&#xD;
      directly from their participation. If TWA testing shows utility in identifying patients at&#xD;
      very low risk for ischemic complications then the results would be of immense value in&#xD;
      guiding the appropriate use of clinical resources in future patients in this context.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Compensation: Patients will not be compensated for participation. Consent: An investigator&#xD;
      will discuss the risks, benefits and objectives of the study. Written informed consent will&#xD;
      be obtained prior to participation on all patients in the study. Because the logistics of the&#xD;
      study are substantially the same as in our preliminary IRB approved study, we will use a&#xD;
      consent form that is substantially equivalent as that used in our preliminary study. Subjects&#xD;
      will be a given a written copy of the T-Wave Alternans in Acute Chest Pain informed consent&#xD;
      sheet.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Confidentiality: TWA test results will be used for research purposes only and will remain&#xD;
      confidential.&#xD;
