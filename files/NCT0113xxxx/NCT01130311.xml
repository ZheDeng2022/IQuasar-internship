    <textblock>
      Tuberculosis is a global public health problem. One third of the world's population is&#xD;
      infected with tuberculosis (TB) with almost 2 million deaths per year globally. According to&#xD;
      the WHO, Pakistan ranks 8th amongst the 22 high TB burden countries, with an estimated&#xD;
      prevalence is 263 cases /100,000 populations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In spite of effective therapy for drug sensitive TB, treatment failure occurs frequently&#xD;
      leading to concerns for the emergence of multi-drug resistant (MDR) and extensively drug&#xD;
      resistant (XDR) mycobacterial strains. Therefore in the recent years, interest has been&#xD;
      generated regarding the role of adjuvant immunomodulating therapy for the treatment of TB.&#xD;
&#xD;
      WHO has classified tuberculosis by disease severity into 3 distinct categories; mild,&#xD;
      moderate and severe according to clinical presentations and host factors. Severity of disease&#xD;
      has been linked to mycobacterium genotypes and with host factors such as vitamin D deficiency&#xD;
&#xD;
      Vitamin D is a hormone produced by the body in response to sun exposure. Independent of it's&#xD;
      effects on bone mineralization, vitamin D is recognized to have numerous immune modulating&#xD;
      effects; some specific to mycobacterium tuberculosis. Therefore vitamin D may enhance the&#xD;
      host immune responses against the pathogen. Vitamin D status can be accurately determined by&#xD;
      measuring the serum levels of 25-(OH) D3. A recent systemic review and meta-analysis explored&#xD;
      the association between low serum vitamin D and risk of active tuberculosis and concluded&#xD;
      that patients with tuberculosis have lower serum levels of vitamin D than healthy controls&#xD;
      when matched for sex, age, ethnicity, diet and geographical location.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Vitamin D deficiency is not a life threatening condition. It usually is unrecognized or can&#xD;
      present with generalized 'aches and pains' due to osteomalacia. The recommended dose for&#xD;
      treatment of vitamin D deficiency is 200,000 IU/ month or 50,000 IU/ week, both given for 2&#xD;
      months or until the serum vitamin D level is &gt; 30 ng/ml. Bone mineral density changes are&#xD;
      usually completed by 10 weeks of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that by replacing vitamin D in patients with active pulmonary&#xD;
      tuberculosis, the 'Time to Recovery' can be shortened.Our aims are to determine whether&#xD;
      replacing patients with insufficient and deficient levels of vitamin D affects the clinical&#xD;
      outcome of the disease.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Tuberculosis Tuberculosis (TB) is a global emergency. In 2004, there were an estimated 8.9&#xD;
      million new cases and 1.7 million deaths due to the disease1. In Pakistan, pulmonary&#xD;
      tuberculosis (TB) is a major public health problem. The population of Pakistan is 160,943,000&#xD;
      with an estimated prevalence of all cases of tuberculosis at 263/100,000, an incidence of&#xD;
      smear positive pulmonary TB of 181/100,000, and a mortality of 34/100,0002.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The management of TB remains a complicated issue even with the availability of effective&#xD;
      anti-tuberculous drugs. One important aspect of this issue has been the difficulty&#xD;
      clinicians' face in measuring clinical response in these patients, especially in&#xD;
      smear-negative pulmonary and extra-pulmonary disease. Christian et al 3. have recently&#xD;
      developed and validated a simple clinical score for the evaluation of TB patients. The score&#xD;
      is based on eleven clinical variables, which were obtained from the WHO clinical manual for&#xD;
      TB. These included self-reported parameters (e.g., cough, hemoptysis, dyspnoea, chest pain&#xD;
      and night sweats), and signs comprising of anemic conjunctivae, tachycardia, positive&#xD;
      findings at lung auscultation, axillary temperature &gt;37.0ËšC, body mass index (BMI) and middle&#xD;
      upper arm circumference (MUAC). Each variable contributes 1 point, except for BMI and MUAC&#xD;
      which contribute 2 points each, giving a maximum score of 13. Using this, score patients can&#xD;
      be divided into 3 severity classes, providing an easy tool for clinical follow up and&#xD;
      prognosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Vitamin D Vitamin D is normally synthesized in the skin under the influence of sunlight or&#xD;
      ingested, It is readily metabo-lized in the liver to form 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D), the&#xD;
      accepted measure of vitamin D status. 25(OH)D is then further metabolized by the 1&#xD;
      hydroxylase enzyme to its biologically active metabolite, 1 , 25 dihy-droxyvitamin D (1&#xD;
      ,25[OH]2D) 4,5 . Activated vitamin D circulates with a binding protein and enters the target&#xD;
      cell to interact with its nuclear receptor. This complex then combines with the retinoic acid&#xD;
      X receptor to form a heterodimer, which in turn interacts with the Vitamin D response element&#xD;
      on the target gene. By increasing in-testinal calcium and phosphate absorption6, increasing&#xD;
      renal calcium reabsorption, and enhancing PTH-mediated bone resorption (via its effect on&#xD;
      RANKL), vitamin D has the net effect of increasing the serum cal-cium and phosphate&#xD;
      concentrations. Additionally, the vitamin D receptor element is present on multiple genes,&#xD;
      the vitamin D receptor in many organs, and 1-alpha hydroxylase activity occurs in extrarenal&#xD;
      tissues7. These local tissue effects are responsible for the non-mineral-related effects of&#xD;
      vitamin D; such as cell differentiation and proliferation and immune regulation8.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Vitamin D deficiency The two most common causes of vitamin D deficiency remains decreased&#xD;
      intake of vitamin D containing food and reduced sun exposure. The major source of vitamin D&#xD;
      is exposure to sunlight, anything that diminishes the transmission or penetration of solar&#xD;
      UVB into the skin will affect the cutaneous synthesis of vitamin D3. Vita-min D deficiency&#xD;
      can therefore occur in people who live without sun exposure (including those whose skin is&#xD;
      constantly protected from the sun by protective clothing, indoor life styles and sunscreen&#xD;
      use.). In addition, very few foods naturally contain vitamin D and foods that are fortified&#xD;
      with with vitamin D are often inadequate to satisfy the vitamin D requirements. Serum levels&#xD;
      of less than 20 ng/mL (50 nmol/L) of 25-OH vitamin D are a commonly accepted cutoff for&#xD;
      vitamin D deficiency , whereas levels between 20 and 30 ng/mL (50 to 75 nmol/L), are&#xD;
      considered insufficiency9,10.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic vitamin D deficiency is increasingly being recognized&#xD;
      around the world. In Pakistan, a number of small studies have identified a high prevalence of&#xD;
      vitamin D deficiency in pa-tient populations that include those presenting with hip&#xD;
      fractures, obstetric cases and those attending ambulatory care clinics. Risk factors include&#xD;
      a history of poor nutrition, lack of exposure to sunlight, and a low socioeco-nomic status.&#xD;
      Zuberi LM et al11 reported that 92% of outpatients presenting to the AKUH, were vitamin D&#xD;
      defi-cient; 62% had severe, 24% moderate and 8% had mild deficiency. Almost half of all these&#xD;
      patients (including those with severe deficiency) were asymptomatic. Two separate studies&#xD;
      from our center involving healthy, as-ymptomatic volunteers have identified a high prevalence&#xD;
      of vitamin D deficiency (unpublished data). Baig MA et al12, in a study on outpatients from&#xD;
      two public hospitals in Karachi, identified that 92% patients were vitamin D deficient and&#xD;
      that the most severe form of D deficiency was seen in patients with tuberculosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Vitamin D Replacement Nutritional deficiency (25OHD &lt;20 ng/ml [50 nmol/L]) requires treatment&#xD;
      with 600,000 IU/month or 50,000 IU/week) 13. In this study we plan to give 600,000 IU/month&#xD;
      for 2 months. Repeat testing for vitamin D will be performed at 8 weeks. If the levels are&#xD;
      &lt;30ng/ml then treatment will be repeated for further 2 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Vitamin D replacement is generally very safe. Toxicity, with the development of&#xD;
      hypercalciuria and hypercal-cemia occurs only at 25OHD levels above 88 ng/ml (220 nmol/L)&#xD;
      14,15 . In 1997, the National Academy of Sci-ences defined the Safe Upper Limit for vitamin D&#xD;
      as 2000 U/day14 but newer data however indicate that higher doses are safe at least over a&#xD;
      several-month period16.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The benefits of vitamin D replacement occur gradually; in one study, skeletal effects were&#xD;
      seen upto 10 months after a 5 week course of therapy17.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Vitamin D and Tuberculosis Clinical studies suggest that vitamin D enhances antimycobacterial&#xD;
      immunity, and that deficiency is associated with susceptibility to active disease18,19. High&#xD;
      doses of vitamin D were widely used to treat active TB in the pre-antibiotic era. More&#xD;
      recently, case-control studies have demonstrated that a vegetarian diet (low in vitamin D) is&#xD;
      an independent risk factor for active TB in South Asians18 and that patients with TB who are&#xD;
      of Gujarati Hindu ethnic origin have significantly higher rates of vitamin D deficiency than&#xD;
      ethnically matched tuberculin-positive TB contacts. Similarly, Gibney et al, documented a&#xD;
      gradation of vitamin D levels in African immigrants to Aus-tralia, with patients with latent&#xD;
      TB having lower levels as compared to controls, while patients with active or past history of&#xD;
      active TB had levels lower than those with latent infection20. A recent systematic review and&#xD;
      meta-analysis 21explored the association between low serum vitamin D and risk of active&#xD;
      tuberculosis and con-cluded that patients with tuberculosis have lower serum levels of&#xD;
      vitamin D than healthy controls when matched for sex, age, ethnicity, diet and geographical&#xD;
      location.&#xD;
&#xD;
      1 ,25(OH)2D has no direct antimycobacterial action, but it does induce antituberculous&#xD;
      activity in vitro in both monocytes and macrophages22.Several mechanisms of action have been&#xD;
      proposed. Exogenous 1 ,25(OH)2D in-duces a superoxide burst23 and enhances phagolysosome&#xD;
      fusion in Mycobacterium tuberculosis-infected macrophages; both phenomena are mediated by&#xD;
      phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, suggesting that this response is initiated by binding membrane&#xD;
      vitamin D receptor (VDR) 24.1 ,25(OH)2D also modulates immune responses by binding nuclear&#xD;
      VDR, where it up-regulates protective innate host responses, including induction of nitric&#xD;
      oxide synthase25.Recently, 25(OH)D has also been shown to support messenger RNA induction of&#xD;
      the antimicrobial peptide cathelicidin LL-37, which possesses antituberculous activity26.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although the association of vitamin D deficiency and tuberculosis has been documented in&#xD;
      epidemiological and clinical studies, a causal role is yet to be verified. Interestingly&#xD;
      isoniazid and rifampicin therapy has been shown to decrease vitamin D levels, raising the&#xD;
      question of whether low vitamin D levels could be a consequence of disease27. Additionally,&#xD;
      the affect of replacing vitamin D in the prevention and treatment of tuberculosis has not&#xD;
      been studied in a systematic manner. There is, therefore, a need for a randomized controlled&#xD;
      trial to evaluate the effect of vitamin D supplementation on antimycobacterial host response&#xD;
      and clinical recovery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Immune responses to Mycobacterium tuberculosis Restriction of infection by M. tuberculosis is&#xD;
      dependent on effective macrophage activation which is facilitated by the recruitment of&#xD;
      leucocytes to the site of infection. The protective role of CD4+, IFN-Î³ producing T cells has&#xD;
      been confirmed in both acute and chronic mycobacterial infections28. Macrophage TNFÎ± plays a&#xD;
      critical role in granuloma formation and in restriction of disease related pathology29. TNF-Î±&#xD;
      and IFN-Î³ activate granu-loma formation by C-C family of chemokines, CCL2, CCL3, CCL4, CCL5&#xD;
      and the C-X-C chemokine family; CXCL8, CXCL9, CXCL10 and CXCL1230 .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Chemokines play a critical role in determining both activation and migration patterns of&#xD;
      circulating monocytes in the blood. CXCL9 is an early predictive marker for IFNÎ³ secreting&#xD;
      cells, and is found to be increased in re-sponse to M. tuberculosis antigen stimulation. CCL5&#xD;
      and IFNÎ³-induced CXCL10 also contribute to the granu-lomatous response31.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Previous studies have shown the utility of mycobacterial antigens such as, from RD1 antigens&#xD;
      early secreted and activated T cell (ESAT)6 in investigating specific immune responses in&#xD;
      individuals infected with M. tuber-culosis. Specific immune profiles have been shown to be&#xD;
      present in TB patients which are coordinate with their disease status32,33.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A study of household contacts of TB patients showed that the dynamics of cytokine response to&#xD;
      mycobacterial antigens driven by IL10 was central to protection against, and the development&#xD;
      of M. tuberculosis infection, and that a peak inflammatory cytokine response at 6 months was&#xD;
      present in those individuals who did not develop disease34 .&#xD;
&#xD;
      We have shown that circulating CXCL9 levels in TB patients differ according to severity of&#xD;
      disease35. In addi-tion, mycobacterial antigen induced CXCL9 responses correlate with IFNÎ³,&#xD;
      and that these are greater in local-ised as compared with disseminated disease36. A recent&#xD;
      study has also shown the relevance of using both CCL2 (MCP-2) and CXCL10 (IP-10) as&#xD;
      biomarkers for tuberculosis37,38 . In this study we hope to determine immune parameters in&#xD;
      patients prior to and post-vitamin D treatment.&#xD;
