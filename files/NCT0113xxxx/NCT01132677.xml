      Do differences exist between patients who receive a single intra-articular injection of&#xD;
      corticosteroid versus patients who receive a single intra-articular injection of hyaluronic&#xD;
      acid for the treatment of knee osteoarthritis at 1, 3 and 6 weeks, and 3 and 6 months post&#xD;
      injection?&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary i. To determine if patients' VAS &quot;pain while walking&quot; is different at 6 weeks&#xD;
      post-injection in patients who receive a single injection of methylprednisolone acetate (MPA)&#xD;
      versus patients who receive a single injection of Hylan G-F 20 (Synvisc One™) for treatment&#xD;
      of knee OA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary i. To determine if differences in VAS &quot;pain while walking&quot; scores exist at 1 and 3&#xD;
      weeks, and 3 and 6 months post injection between MPA and HA patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ii. To determine if differences in VAS &quot;pain at rest&quot; scores exist at 1, 3 and 6 weeks and 3&#xD;
      and 6 months post injection between MPA and HA patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      iii. To determine if differences in VAS &quot;pain with stairs&quot; scores exist at 1, 3 and 6 weeks&#xD;
      and 3 and 6 months post injection between MPA and HA patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      iii. To determine if differences in KOOS questionnaire scores exist at 6 weeks, 3 months and&#xD;
      6 months post injection between MPA and HA patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      iv. To determine if differences in WOMAC questionnaire scores exist at 6 weeks, 3 months, and&#xD;
      6 months post injection between MPA and HA patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      v. To determine if differences in adverse events exist at 1, 3 and 6 weeks, and 3, and 6&#xD;
      months post injection between MPA and HA patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      vi. To track the number of patients who receive additional injections after 3 months&#xD;
      following their index injection.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>The primary outcome will be &quot;pain while walking for approximately 30 minutes on a flat surface today&quot; as reported by the patient on a 100mm unmarked VAS (0 = no pain; 100 = worst pain possible).</measure>
    <time_frame>VAS Form will be given at baseline (prior to injection) and then at 1, 3 and 6 weeks, and 3 and 6 months post injection.</time_frame>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Pain at rest or with stairs as reported byu the patient on a VAS</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (pre-injection), 1, 3 and 6 weeks, and 3 and 6 months post injection</time_frame>
    <description>Secondary Outcomes:&#xD;
i. &quot;Pain at rest&quot; and &quot;pain with stairs&quot; as reported by the patient on a VAS&#xD;
(Additional outcomes ii. Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS). The KOOS is a valid, reliable and responsive questionnaire that is self-administered and consists of 5 subscales.&#xD;
iii. The KOOS includes the WOMAC Osteoarthritis Index LK 3.0 and thus, WOMAC scores will also be computed.&#xD;
iv. Adverse events as reviewed and documented by the physician v. The number of subsequent re-injections or treatment strategies.)</description>
