      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - The purpose of the 1982 1986 North Carolina Early Pregnancy Study was to determine how&#xD;
      often pregnancy loss occurs before women know they are pregnant. Women planning to become&#xD;
      pregnant were asked to collect daily urine specimens and fill out daily diaries of their&#xD;
      intercourse and menstrual bleeding. Researchers are interested in re-contacting this cohort&#xD;
      to gather new information and to examine how accurately women can recall events that occurred&#xD;
      earlier in their lives.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To follow-up with and gather additional information from women who were involved in the&#xD;
      Early Pregnancy Study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Women who participated in the 1982 1986 North Carolina Early Pregnancy Study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will receive and complete a questionnaire that includes the following&#xD;
           topics:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Their pregnancy history.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The infant s birth, including method of delivery and induction of labor.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Early life exposures such as their own birth weight and their parents ages at their&#xD;
           birth.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Tap water use during their attempt to conceive&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  General description of their behaviors during their participation in the original study,&#xD;
           these include: physical activity, caffeine, alcohol, and soy food consumption.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will return the surveys to the researchers in the stamped envelope provided&#xD;
           with the questionnaire.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      We propose a follow-up study of women who participated in the North Carolina Early Pregnancy&#xD;
      Study (EPS) in 1982-1986. Women enrolled in the study after discontinuing birth control and&#xD;
      were followed for the occurrence of a pregnancy. Participants completed daily diaries and&#xD;
      collected first morning urine specimens which allowed the identification of menstrual cycles.&#xD;
      Thus each woman s time to pregnancy was prospectively measured. We intend to trace the women&#xD;
      and ask them to complete a questionnaire that includes their recall of their time to&#xD;
      pregnancy during the study. This will allow us to address two major questions, one regarding&#xD;
      the recall of time-to-pregnancy, and the other regarding the natural length of gestation. In&#xD;
      addition, we will investigate associations of bisphenal A (BPA), phthalate metabolites, 2,4-&#xD;
      and 2,5-dichlorophenols, Triclosan, benzophenone-3, and methyl-, propyl- and butyl-parabens&#xD;
      with reproductive outcomes. This is described in a separate section at the end of this&#xD;
      protocol because it does not involve recontacting participants, only assay of stored urine&#xD;
      samples for purposes within the goals of the original study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Recall of time-to-pregnancy&#xD;
&#xD;
           Time to pregnancy is a commonly studied estimate of fecundability. This outcome has been&#xD;
           used to study the reproductive effects of environmental toxins, cigarette smoking,&#xD;
           obesity and numerous other exposures. Prospective studies of time to pregnancy require&#xD;
           enrollment of women who are just starting to attempt pregnancy and following them until&#xD;
           a pregnancy is conceived. This type of study can be time-consuming and costly. It is&#xD;
           also difficult to identify a population of women who are just beginning to attempt&#xD;
           pregnancy. A more efficient design is to ask women to recall their time to pregnancy.&#xD;
           This design is limited however, as it is unknown how well women can recall their time to&#xD;
           pregnancy. Only two studies have examined this question in a population with both&#xD;
           prospective and retrospectively recalled time to pregnancy. One of the studies involved&#xD;
           women from the Netherlands, the recall period was short (3-20 months), and only part of&#xD;
           the woman s time to pregnancy was prospectively observed. The second study had a longer&#xD;
           recall period (1-10 years) but included only 43 women.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Length of gestation&#xD;
&#xD;
      Gestational length is the time from conception to delivery. The EPS has very good data on the&#xD;
      first data point, and we know date of delivery. However, our data on delivery is limited by&#xD;
      the fact that we do not know which deliveries were induced and which were the product of&#xD;
      natural onset of labor and delivery. We plan to collect this information from the mothers.&#xD;
      Such information will not only allow us to consider the natural variability in gestational&#xD;
      age (a measure that does not exist at present) but also to estimate associations between&#xD;
      events in very early pregnancy and the subsequent duration of pregnancy. The EPS has detailed&#xD;
      measurements of the time from ovulation to implantation, the rate of increase in human&#xD;
      chorionic gonadotropin and corpus luteum rescue. To our knowledge, these early pregnancy&#xD;
      characteristics have not been investigated for associations with length of gestation.&#xD;
