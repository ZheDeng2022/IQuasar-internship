    <textblock>
      Irritable bowel syndrome is a common digestive disorder worldwide. However, there is no&#xD;
      effective treatment of irritable bowel syndrome. Visceral pain thresholds in response to&#xD;
      stress are lower in patients with IBS compared to healthy volunteers, but the triggers to&#xD;
      visceral hypersensitivity remain largely unknown. Animal models suggest roles for both host&#xD;
      immune response and intestinal bacteria in the induction of visceral hypersensitivity. For&#xD;
      instance colorectal distension increased in association with an alteration in bacterial flora&#xD;
      induced by antibiotic therapy, which suggest a relationship between bacterial gut content and&#xD;
      visceral afferent processing. Intestinal bacteria play a significant role in inducing IBS.&#xD;
      Clinical studies have shown that manipulation of the commensal microbiota with probiotic&#xD;
      bacteria, in particularly preparations that contain bifidobacteria, can alleviate IBS&#xD;
      symptoms. Serotonin (5-HT) plays a crucial role in the regulation of gastrointestinal&#xD;
      physiology and alterations in mucosal serotonin signaling is a possible mechanism of altered&#xD;
      function and sensation in patients with IBS. Impairment of serotonin reuptake transporter&#xD;
      (SERT) expression and function may also play a role in IBS. The investigators hypothesise&#xD;
      that bacteria modulate sensory afferent and serotonin signaling necessary for visceral&#xD;
      sensation and that these pathways can be targeted for therapy of IBS using probiotic&#xD;
      bacteria. The first part of this study will be a cross-sectional study comparing the colonic&#xD;
      microbiota and SERT polymorphisms in IBS patients and healthy controls. The second part will&#xD;
      be an open-label pilot study to assess the effects of oral probiotic bacteria in visceral&#xD;
      hypersensitivity and mucosal microbiota in patients with IBS. Clinical response will be&#xD;
      assessed based on IBS symptom score and rectal sensitivity, and changes in mucosa microbiota&#xD;
      will be measured using 454 pyrosequencing. This proposal will provide novel data on gut&#xD;
      microbiota in Asian IBS patients, and explore the mechanisms underlying visceral&#xD;
      hypersensitivity to direct future targeting of therapy in IBS.&#xD;

      Background&#xD;
&#xD;
      An incomplete understanding of the mechanisms underlying irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) has&#xD;
      hampered the development of an effective therapy for this condition. This is long overdue for&#xD;
      a condition that affects at least 20 percent of the population (1), and has a major impact on&#xD;
      patient's quality of life (QOL) (2).Current understanding of the underlying aetiology and&#xD;
      pathogenesis of IBS is centered on two levels: the brain-gut axis which provides concept of&#xD;
      how stress, emotion and psychological conditions all alter the perception of IBS symptoms.&#xD;
      Within the intestinal wall, the patho-physiological mechanisms that are implicated in IBS&#xD;
      include infection, immune activation, dysmotility, abnormal fermentation and visceral&#xD;
      hypersensitivity. Studies have shown that visceral pain thresholds in response to stress are&#xD;
      lower in patients with IBS compared to healthy volunteers (3). This hypersensitivity is&#xD;
      apparent in response to both a physical and chemical stimulus but the triggers to visceral&#xD;
      hypersensitivity remain largely unknown. intestinal bacteria play a significant role in&#xD;
      inducing IBS. For instance post-infectious IBS developed in a subgroup of patients following&#xD;
      a bout of gastroenteritis (4). Manipulation of the commensal microbiota can alleviate IBS&#xD;
      symptoms and there is some evidence that probiotic preparations containing certain&#xD;
      Bifidobacteria may be particularly effective (5). This proposal will focus on further&#xD;
      exploration of the mechanisms underlying visceral hypersensitivity to direct future targeting&#xD;
      of therapy with probiotic preparation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aims The aims of this study are (i) to identify IBS-associated changes in intestinal&#xD;
      microbiota; (ii) to study SERT expression and genotyping, and their relationship with the gut&#xD;
      microbiota, and (iii) to determine whether probiotic therapy alters visceral sensitivity in&#xD;
      IBS patients and whether probiotic-induced changes in visceral hypersensitivity are&#xD;
      associated with changes in the intestinal microbiota.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis The investigators postulate that bacteria modulate sensory afferent signalling and&#xD;
      serotonin signalling, necessary for visceral sensation and that these pathways can be&#xD;
      targeted for therapy of IBS using probiotic bacteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RESEARCH PLAN This study consists of two parts. The first part will be a cross-sectional&#xD;
      study comparing the colonic microbiota and SERT expression in IBS patients and healthy&#xD;
      controls. The second part will involve a pilot open-label study to assess the effects of oral&#xD;
      probiotic bacteria in visceral hypersensitivity, SERT expression and mucosal microbiota in&#xD;
      patients with IBS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline visit Ten subjects with IBS will be recruited from outpatient clinics. Disease&#xD;
      severity will be determined at enrolment with a validated IBS symptom questionnaire. Routine&#xD;
      blood tests including full blood count, biochemistry profile and C-reactive protein will be&#xD;
      obtained. Rectal sensitivity to pressure and pain will be assessed with Barostat device.&#xD;
      Barostat device has been used in many other studies as a measure of visceral&#xD;
      hypersensitivity. Equipment for both tests is currently in use at our laboratory. A baseline&#xD;
      colonoscopy will be performed and rectal biopsies will be taken. Ten controls undergoing&#xD;
      screening colonoscopy for polyps or colorectal cancer and subsequently found to have a normal&#xD;
      colonoscopy will be included to participate in the FGI-Bx study, in which their tissue&#xD;
      samples would be used in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline samples from IBS:&#xD;
&#xD;
      1 rectal tissue (formalin fixed for histology) 2 rectal tissues (SERT polymorphism) 3 rectal&#xD;
      tissues (mucosal microbiota) 5ml blood in EDTA tube (SERT polymorphism)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Samples from controls:&#xD;
&#xD;
      1 rectal tissue (formalin fixed for histology) 2 rectal tissues (SERT polymorphism) 3 rectal&#xD;
      tissues (mucosal microbiota) 5ml blood in EDTA tube (SERT polymorphism)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention IBS Patients will receive VSL#3 (450 billion lyophilized bacteria/sachet) twice&#xD;
      daily for 4 weeks. VSL#3 was selected for use in this study because (a) it contains three&#xD;
      different Bifidobacteria strains (in addition to lactobacilli and streptococci) and the&#xD;
      limited evidence available Bifidobacteria as the most effective probiotics in IBS (13) . A&#xD;
      flow chart of the study is in appendix 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Week 4 Assessment&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical response to probiotic therapy Assessments will be made at baseline and at day 28 of&#xD;
      therapy. The three symptoms of IBS will be assessed to determine response to therapy:&#xD;
      abdominal pain/ discomfort, bloating/ distension and bowel movements, each scored on an&#xD;
      ordinal scale (Likert scale; maximum score 7) and on a 100mm visual analogue scale (VAS;&#xD;
      maximum score 100). A composite score with the sums of the 3 cardinal symptoms will also be&#xD;
      calculated for each patient (Likert scale maximum score 21) (VAS; maximum score 300). Repeat&#xD;
      rectal sensitivity testing will be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Changes in mucosa microbiota in response to probiotic therapy Assessments will be made at&#xD;
      baseline and at day 28. Because of the somewhat invasive nature of a repeat colonoscopy, the&#xD;
      investigators will only perform a flexible sigmoidoscopy to obtain rectal biopsies after&#xD;
      probiotic treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Week 4 samples from IBS:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. rectal tissue (formalin fixed for histology)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. rectal tissues (SERT polymorphism)&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. rectal tissues (mucosal microbiota)&#xD;
&#xD;
      5ml blood in EDTA (SERT polymorphism)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Six months follow-up Patients will be contacted at 6 months to reassess symptom scores to&#xD;
      determine longer-term impact of therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      COLONOSCOPY Colonoscopy will be performed as an outpatient procedure under conscious sedation&#xD;
      with intravenous diazepam and pethidine. Subjects will receive bowel preparation with PEG.&#xD;
      For flexible sigmoidoscopy, an unprepared examination with be performed and four biopsies&#xD;
      will be obtained at 15cm from the anal verge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RECTAL BAROSTAT The barostat device contains a built-in computer system that can be&#xD;
      programmed to automatically perform distensions of balloon with fixed time lags and bag&#xD;
      pressure increments. Variation in balloon volume in a constant pressure reflects the change&#xD;
      in tone and compliance of the visceral wall. Furthermore, through a programmed variation in&#xD;
      intraballoon pressure, the sensory threshold of subject can be evaluated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patient is instructed to administer 4.5 fl oz of sodium phosphates rectally 4 hours&#xD;
      before study at home for rectal cleansing. After a 3-hour fast, the participant will be&#xD;
      positioned in left lateral position. A barostat bag is inserted into the rectum. The barostat&#xD;
      device is connected to the barostat catheter using a low compliance PVC tubing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After 10 minutes of resting, phasic isobaric rectal distensions are performed automatically&#xD;
      using ascending method of limits (AML) protocol with successive increments of 4 mm Hg&#xD;
      (40-second duration) alternating with intermittent periods of bag deflation (40 seconds).&#xD;
      During each distension phase, the participant is requested to report the perception ratings&#xD;
      by pressing on the perception panel of barostat device with the following scale: (1) No&#xD;
      sensation of balloon distension, (2) the first sensation of balloon distension, (3) desire&#xD;
      for defecation, (4) maximum tolerable sensation. The procedure will be stopped when pain or&#xD;
      maximum tolerable sensation is reported. The sensory threshold is defined as lower limit of&#xD;
      the bag pressure that evokes the first sensation of balloon distension. The pain threshold is&#xD;
      defined as pressure that elicits a &quot;pain&quot; response or maximum tolerable sensation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MUCOSAL MICROBIOTA Colonic samples will be taken to represent adherent bacterial flora. All&#xD;
      samples will be stored at -80 degree Celsius until use. Each sample will be added to tubes&#xD;
      containing 500µl of phenol: Chloroform: isoamyl alcohol (24:24:1), and 500µl of 0.1mm&#xD;
      diameter zirconia/silica beads (Biospec Products, Barthesville, OK). Microbial cells will be&#xD;
      disrupted mechanically at 23 degree Celsius with a bead beater (Biospec Products, instrument&#xD;
      set on high for 2 minutes). Isolated DNA will be fractionated by electrophoresis through 1%&#xD;
      agarose gels, and the dominant band will be purified by MiniElute Gel Extraction kit&#xD;
      (Qiagen).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Amplification of the bacterial 16S ribosomal RNA sequences for pyrosequencing will be&#xD;
      performed by PCR. For each sample, 100-200mg of purified genomic DNA will be amplified by&#xD;
      using primers BSR357-A and BSF8-B, which anneal to conserved regions of bacterial 16s rRNA&#xD;
      gene. The PCR products will be sequenced using the 454 Life Sciences Technology Genome&#xD;
      Sequencer FLX system (provided by Faculty of Science, CUHK). Quality control will be achieved&#xD;
      by the following criteria: the sequence should (i) show a perfect match to the bar code and&#xD;
      16S ribosomal RNA gene primer, (ii) be at least 50 nucleotide in length, (iii) have no more&#xD;
      than two undetermined bases in the sequence read, and (iv) have at least a 75% match to a&#xD;
      previously determined 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequence. Operational taxonomic unit (OTU)&#xD;
      clustering and analysis will be carried out using OTUPicker. Clustering and principal&#xD;
      coordinate analysis will be conducted using UniFrac. Since errors in pyrosequencing occur at&#xD;
      a rate of only 0.25%, most of the 400-nucleotide sequences that remain after filtering will&#xD;
      contain either 0 or 1 error. This level of sequencing error will not affect the taxonomic&#xD;
      analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The final data set for colonic microbial taxonomic analysis will be compared with the&#xD;
      1,358,426-sequence Ribosomal Database Project Release 10.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SEROTONIN TRANSPORTER POLYMORPHISM For genotyping, DNA will be isolated from blood platelet&#xD;
      (from venous blood) and colon biopsies by standard phenol/chloroform extraction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The 44-bp insertion/deletion polymorphism in the promoter region (SERT-P) will be analysed by&#xD;
      PCR of sample DNA with forward primer 5'-GAG GGA CTG AGC TGG ACA ACC AC-3' and reverse primer&#xD;
      5'-GGC GTT GCC GCT CTG AAT GC-3'. The expected product sizes are 484 bp for deletion (s) and&#xD;
      528 bp for insertion (l) respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The 17-bp VNTR polymorphism of SERT gene intron 2 will be studied by PCR of sample DNA with&#xD;
      forward primer 5'-GTC AGT ATC ACA GGC TGC GAG-3' and reverse primer 5'-TGT TCC TAG TCT TAC&#xD;
      GCC AGT-3'. The expected product sizes for alleles 9, 10, 11 and 12 are 253bp, 270bp, 287bp&#xD;
      and 304bp respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The colonic and platelet SERT protein expressions will also be studied by real time PCR and&#xD;
      western blot method.&#xD;
