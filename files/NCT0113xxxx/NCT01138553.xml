      The primary objective of this study is to identify the group of women with early stage breast&#xD;
      cancer most likely to benefit from treatment with the selective progesterone receptor&#xD;
      modulator (SPRM) mifepristone. This will be done by treating women briefly prior to planned&#xD;
      surgery and examining the decrease in growth rate (measured by Ki-67 immunohistochemistry) in&#xD;
      tumor samples taken before and after exposure to mifepristone.&#xD;

      Secondary objectives of this study include; (1) Measuring objective response in tumor size&#xD;
      with treatment, (2) Establishing the safety and tolerability of short term mifepristone&#xD;
      exposure in early stage breast cancer patients, and (3) Performing exploratory studies of&#xD;
      expression of related targets following drug exposure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anti-estrogen therapy has been a mainstay of breast cancer treatment for over three decades.&#xD;
      It is highly effective and has modest toxicity, certainly in comparison to chemotherapy. The&#xD;
      selective estrogen receptor modulator tamoxifen has the longest history but a number of&#xD;
      aromatase inhibitors and the anti-estrogen fulvestrant are also in widespread use along with&#xD;
      ovarian ablation for pre-menopausal women. Given the success of this approach, and the highly&#xD;
      analogous parallel progesterone signal, it is unfortunate that anti-progesterone therapy has&#xD;
      not been similarly pursued. Additionally, data from the Woman's Health Initiative trial&#xD;
      reveal a potentially significant role for progesterone in breast cancer development and&#xD;
      growth. Healthy postmenopausal women treated with the combination of estrogen and&#xD;
      progesterone over a 5 year period were 24% more likely to develop invasive breast cancer and&#xD;
      had larger tumors at diagnosis. Notably this effect was not seen in post-hysterectomy women&#xD;
      treated with estrogen alone over nearly 7 years. In fact a non-statistically significant&#xD;
      reduction in breast cancer incidence was observed with estrogen alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The anti-progesterone mifepristone has been found to reduce proliferation in normal breast&#xD;
      tissue. Even a low dose of mifepristone (50mg every other day for 3 months) demonstrated a&#xD;
      statistically significant reduction in breast cell proliferation (measured by Ki-67&#xD;
      immunohistochemistry).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Higher doses of mifepristone, 200mg daily, have been used in patients with metastatic breast&#xD;
      cancer for durations of almost 2 years without serious toxicity. Response rates were only 11%&#xD;
      but no grade 4 or 5 toxicities occurred. Some grade 3 toxicities occurred, including&#xD;
      lethargy, nausea, vomiting, and skin rash. These rashes resolved with temporary&#xD;
      discontinuation of drug and did not recur when drug was resumed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As a whole these data strongly support research into anti-progesterone therapy for early&#xD;
      stage breast cancer. To our knowledge this is the first such study.&#xD;
