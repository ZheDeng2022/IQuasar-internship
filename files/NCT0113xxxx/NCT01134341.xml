  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to determine the recommended dose, safety, pharmacokinetics, and early&#xD;
      efficacy of the combination of pralatrexate plus oral bexarotene in patients with relapsed or&#xD;
      refractory CTCL.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center, dose-finding, Phase 1 study of pralatrexate plus bexarotene in&#xD;
      patients who have relapsed or refractory CTCL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objective(s):&#xD;
&#xD;
      • Determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and recommended dose of pralatrexate plus&#xD;
      bexarotene with concurrent vitamin B12 and folic acid supplementation when administered to&#xD;
      patients who have failed prior systemic treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objective(s):&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine the safety profile of pralatrexate plus bexarotene when administered to&#xD;
           patients with relapsed/refractory cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Collect preliminary efficacy data.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of pralatrexate plus bexarotene in patients&#xD;
           who underwent plasma PK sampling&#xD;

    <description>Bexarotene (Targretin): administered po qd. The initial daily dose of bexarotene will depend on the cohort to which each patient is assigned. Bexarotene will be self-administered except in patients who underwent plasma PK sampling on cycle 1, dose 1 and cycle 1, dose 3, at which time bexarotene was to be administered at the investigational site 1 hour (± 5 minutes) prior to pralatrexate administration.&#xD;
Pralatrexate (Folotyn): administered weekly via IV push over a minimum of 30 seconds up to a maximum of 5 minutes. One cycle is 4 weeks in duration consisting of weekly dosing of pralatrexate for 3 weeks followed by 1 week of rest. The initial dose of pralatrexate will depend on the cohort to which each patient is assigned.</description>
