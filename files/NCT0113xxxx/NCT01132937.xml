      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Traumatic brain injury may have a range of effects, from severe and permanent disability to&#xD;
      more subtle functional and cognitive deficits that often go undetected during initial&#xD;
      treatment. To improve treatments and therapies and to provide a uniform quality of care,&#xD;
      researchers are interested in developing more standardized criteria for diagnosing and&#xD;
      classifying different types of traumatic brain injury. By identifying imaging and other&#xD;
      indicators immediately after the injury and during the initial treatment phrase, researchers&#xD;
      hope to better understand the nature and effects of acute traumatic brain injury.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To study the MRI results of individuals who have recently had head injury and suspected&#xD;
           traumatic brain injury.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To study the natural evolution of traumatic brain injury for up to 3 months after head&#xD;
           injury.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Individuals at least 18 years of age who have been admitted to a hospital with a diagnosed&#xD;
      or suspected traumatic brain injury within the past 48 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will have one 3-hour study visits: an initial visit (within 48 hours of&#xD;
           head injury). Participants may be asked to have an optional 4-day, 30-day, 90-day, and&#xD;
           1-year follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Each visit may involve blood samples, an MRI scan (approximately 30 minutes), and a&#xD;
           series of tests to evaluate brain function.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  At the optional follow-up visit, participants may have blood samples, an MRI scan, and a&#xD;
           general traumatic brain injury assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  This study does not provide treatment and does not replace any current therapies.&#xD;
           However, participants who are eligible for other National Institutes of Health studies&#xD;
           may be referred to these studies by researchers.&#xD;

      Objective&#xD;
&#xD;
      To generate natural history data for cohort-based comparisons to serve as the basis for&#xD;
      hypothesis-driven studies and to contribute to the clinical and physiological understanding&#xD;
      of traumatic brain injury (TBI) through the description of manifestations of the injury and&#xD;
      the relationship among radiological, hematological, clinical variables and standard&#xD;
      functional outcome measures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population&#xD;
&#xD;
      One thousand male and female adult subjects with history of recent head injury with or&#xD;
      suspected non-penetrating acute TBI, will be enrolled. Subjects having varying degrees of TBI&#xD;
      severity will be recruited from the collaborative programs between NIH and non-NIH hospitals.&#xD;
      We anticipate approximately 80% of subjects will be classified as mild TBI, concussion, or no&#xD;
      injury.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a prospective study of subjects with known and suspected non-penetrating acute&#xD;
      traumatic brain injury. Subjects presenting to the emergency department or trauma service at&#xD;
      participating hospitals with a history of recent suspected head injury will be studied during&#xD;
      the course of their hospital stay and after discharge using radiological, hematological,&#xD;
      clinical and functional outcome measures. Subjects will be stratified according to findings&#xD;
      and time of initial imaging into cohorts for comparison.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The design is intentionally broad in scope to allow acquisition of data for the development&#xD;
      of future hypothesis-driven research. Research performed under this protocol will not&#xD;
      interfere with standard of care and subjects will not be treated with experimental therapies&#xD;
      as part of the research study. Data collected under this research study may be shared without&#xD;
      personal identifiers with other researchers if subjects approve this option on the informed&#xD;
      consent. Data and samples collected under this protocol and other protocols that allow data&#xD;
      sharing will be combined for secondary analysis under this protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome Measures&#xD;
&#xD;
      A variety of outcome measures will be used including diagnosis, evidence of injury on&#xD;
      magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and positron emission tomography (PET), functional&#xD;
      impairment, and quality of life (QOL) assessments. Research questions will focus on a&#xD;
      positive diagnosis of brain injury and monitoring the natural history. Statistical analysis&#xD;
      plans will be developed as specific research questions and hypotheses are generated.&#xD;
