  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      High blood pressure (hypertension) is an important cause of myocardial infarction and stroke.&#xD;
      High blood pressure often occurs in people who are overweight. These people frequently also&#xD;
      have abnormal fat and sugar metabolism. The combination of these problems is called the&#xD;
      'metabolic syndrome'.&#xD;
&#xD;
      People with hypertension and obesity currently receive the same drug therapy as people with&#xD;
      hypertension, but without obesity. Different classes of drugs are thought to be equally&#xD;
      effective in lowering blood pressure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Next to lowering blood pressure, hypertension treatment can have additional effects, like&#xD;
      changes in blood vessel function (the ability to dilate and constrict) or changes is the&#xD;
      metabolism of sugar and fat. Particularly in patients with the metabolic syndrome, these&#xD;
      additional effects are thought to be of great importance, because they can influence the risk&#xD;
      for cardiovascular diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The blood pressure lowering mechanism differs between classes of blood pressure lowering&#xD;
      medication. The purpose of this study is to compare the effects of three types of blood&#xD;
      pressure lowering medication belonging to different classes. The main outcomes of interest&#xD;
      will be blood vessel function (the ability to dilate and constrict) and blood pressure.&#xD;
      Moreover, the effect of treatment on additional outcomes, like metabolism of sugar and fat,&#xD;
      will be studied.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Treatment of obesity related hypertension (ORH) is challenging and has become an important&#xD;
      global health problem. According to guidelines, most classes of antihypertensives are equally&#xD;
      effective for the treatment of hypertension. However, these guidelines are based on evidence&#xD;
      from studies in patients with essential hypertension, but without a specific focus on ORH.&#xD;
      There is an increasing body of evidence about the complex pathophysiological mechanisms of&#xD;
      ORH. Adipose tissue dysfunction is commonly regarded as a common soil that eventually causes&#xD;
      up regulation of the sympathetic nervous system (SNS) and the renin-angiotensin-system (RAS).&#xD;
      Moreover, development of hypertension is closely related to development of endothelial&#xD;
      dysfunction, dyslipidemia and disorders of glucose metabolism. The investigators hypothesize&#xD;
      that treatment with antihypertensives that are directed at down regulation of the SNS&#xD;
      (moxonidine) and the RAS (aliskiren) will result in more beneficial effects than treatment&#xD;
      with a diuretic (hydrochlorothiazide), because the latter reduces blood pressure by&#xD;
      inhibition of sodium resorption, without influencing the underlying disease mechanism. The&#xD;
      main outcomes of interest are endothelial function and blood pressure, but many secondary&#xD;
      outcomes are studied too.&#xD;

        Inclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient is a male or post menopausal female, 30-70 years of age on the day of signing&#xD;
             informed consent. Post menopausal status is assumed if a woman has not experienced a&#xD;
             menstrual bleed for a minimum of 12 months, assuming that she still has a uterus, and&#xD;
             is not pregnant or lactating. In women without a uterus, menopause or postmenopause is&#xD;
             defined by a very high FSH level.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  All patients should fulfil the diagnostic criterion of abdominal adiposity: waist&#xD;
             circumference &gt; 102 cm (men) or &gt; 88 cm (women). The waist circumference is measured&#xD;
             halfway between the lower rib and iliac crest in standing position.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  All patients should fulfil the diagnostic criterium for hypertension: systolic blood&#xD;
             pressure &gt;/= 130 mmHg and/or diastolic blood pressure &gt;/= 85 mmHg during both visits.&#xD;
             Blood pressure is assessed by office readings in accordance with current guidelines&#xD;
             for hypertension diagnosis. The patient needs to be seated some minutes before and&#xD;
             during the measurement. The cuff size should be adjusted to the patients' arm&#xD;
             circumference and needs to be on the same height level as the patients' sternum during&#xD;
             the measurements. Blood pressure is determined to a 2 mmHg accuracy-level. Blood&#xD;
             pressure is measured on both arms during the first visit. In both measurements differ&#xD;
             more than 10 mmHg, the highest value is taken. After at least 15 seconds, the&#xD;
             measurement is repeated during the same visit. The highest mean of the two&#xD;
             measurements on the same arm is considered as the actual blood pressure value.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients should fulfil one or more of the following criteria to meet the definition of&#xD;
             the metabolic syndrome: 1)Hypertriglyceridemia (serum triglycerides &gt; 1.7 mmol/L); 2)&#xD;
             Low High-density lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol (serum HDL-cholesterol &lt; 1.04 mmol/L&#xD;
             (men) or &lt; 1.29 mmol/L (women)); 3)High fasting glucose (fasting serum glucose &gt; 5.6&#xD;

             informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Systolic blood pressure &gt; 180 mmHg and/or diastolic blood pressure &gt; 110 mmHg during&#xD;
             one or more screening measurements.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Body Mass Index (BMI) &gt; 35 kg/m2&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Current smoking or smoking during the previous 3 months&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Use of &quot;recreational&quot; or illicit drugs&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Recent history (within the last year) of alcohol abuse or dependence.&#xD;
