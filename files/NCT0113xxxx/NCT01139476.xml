      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Multiple myeloma (MM), a type of cancer that affects the white blood cells, is often&#xD;
      preceded by a precancerous disorder known as monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined&#xD;
      significance (MGUS). Farmers and other agricultural workers have a higher risk of developing&#xD;
      MGUS and MM, possibly because of their exposure to certain pesticides. Researchers are&#xD;
      interested in studying biological specimens taken from participants in the Agricultural&#xD;
      Health Study - specifically, pesticide applicators at least 50 years of age who do not have&#xD;
      cancer- to better understand the development of MGUS and MM.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To collect biological specimens from Agricultural Health Study participants for further&#xD;
           research.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To examine the relationship between pesticide exposure and MGUS/MM.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Male pesticide applicators who are over 50 years of age, cancer-free, and participating in&#xD;
      the Agricultural Health Study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Two groups of participants will complete the study: a general group and a smaller group&#xD;
           of individuals who have been exposed to the pesticide diazinon.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  All participants will receive an initial contact letter with information about the&#xD;
           study, followed by a phone call to administer a screening questionnaire and arrange a&#xD;
           home visit from a researcher within the next month.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will receive by mail a urine specimen kit that will be collected at the&#xD;
           home visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  During the home visit, a study researcher will take blood samples and collect the urine&#xD;
           sample, and will administer another questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants in the group exposed to diazinon will have three home visits for the study:&#xD;
           (1) prior to pesticide exposure, (2) the day after participants stop using diazinon, and&#xD;
           (3) about 21 days after the second visit. The first visit will take place in the&#xD;
           off-season from January to March; the second and third visits will be conducted between&#xD;
           April and August.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  No treatment will be provided as part of this study.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      We propose to conduct a molecular epidemiology study with a subset of participants in the&#xD;
      Agricultural Health Study (AHS), a prospective cohort of 57,310 licensed pesticide&#xD;
      applicators in Iowa and North Carolina. Blood and urine samples will be collected from 1,990&#xD;
      cancer-free male AHS participants over the age of 50. These participants will also be asked&#xD;
      to complete a brief interview (approximately 20 minutes) regarding recent exposures and other&#xD;
      lifestyle and health characteristics, which will be conducted at the time of the biospecimen&#xD;
      collection. Participants in both Iowa and North Carolina will be enrolled and home visits for&#xD;
      interviews and sample collection will take place throughout the year between 2010-2014.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed study has two primary objectives. First, we will determine the prevalence and&#xD;
      study the etiology of monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS), which is a&#xD;
      precursor biomarker for multiple myeloma. We will compare the prevalence of MGUS in the AHS&#xD;
      cohort with the prevalence in two general population-based cohorts ( i.e., Olmsted County and&#xD;
      NHANES IID) with well-characterized MGUS prevalence levels. As a result of previous data&#xD;
      collection efforts in the AHS, comprehensive information on lifetime occupational exposures&#xD;
      and lifestyle factors will be available for the subjects included in this study. We will&#xD;
      examine the associations between MGUS and lifetime exposure to specific pesticides within the&#xD;
      AHS cohort. We will also evaluate several other biomarkers, including telomere length and&#xD;
      global DNA hypomethylation in peripheral blood lymphocytes, for associations with specific&#xD;
      pesticides and excess risk of MGUS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The second objective is to establish a resource with the remaining blood and urine samples&#xD;
      collected from the participants in this study. These biospecimens will be used to evaluate&#xD;
      the biological plausibility and the mechanism-of-action of associations between pesticides&#xD;
      and cancers observed in earlier AHS studies. Many of these pesticides are non-genotoxic and&#xD;
      their mechanism of carcinogenesis has not been determined. One such future study involving&#xD;
      repository samples will be an investigation of monoclonal B-cell lymphocytosis (MBL), a&#xD;
      marker which has been shown to precede chronic lymphocytic leukemia in previous studies.&#xD;
      Several pesticides in current widespread use in the AHS have been linked to leukemia. We will&#xD;
      determine the prevalence of MBL in the AHS cohort and evaluate potential associations with&#xD;
      specific pesticides of interest to better explain the relation between pesticide exposures&#xD;
      and leukemia risk.&#xD;
