  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to understand the biology and behavior of early mother-infant&#xD;
      attachment, and to investigate how it may be affected by prenatal substance exposures. The&#xD;
      investigators are interested in how drugs such as cocaine, alcohol, marijuana and cigarette&#xD;
      smoking affect both mother and baby.&#xD;

      The investigators are looking for pregnant women or mothers with their newborn infants to&#xD;
      participate in this study. Eligible women include mothers who have used any of the following&#xD;
      drugs at any time during pregnancy (alone or in combination):&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. cocaine&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. nicotine (cigarettes)&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. marijuana&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. alcohol&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators are also looking for mothers who have not used any drugs during pregnancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Information collected in this research study is strictly confidential, and protection of&#xD;
      sensitive information is additionally assured by an NIH Certificate of Confidentiality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participation in this study involves:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. One visit at 2-4 weeks postpartum. This visit includes an interview for mother and a 30&#xD;
           minute brain scan (no radiation, no sedation) for baby.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Two visits at 3 months postpartum. Mothers will have blood pressure and heart rate&#xD;
           measured while they look at videos about babies, listen to baby sounds, interact with&#xD;
           their own baby. Samples of blood, urine and saliva will be taken from mother. Baby will&#xD;
           have a developmental assessment, and saliva samples will be taken.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Payment is $300 or the equivalent in Walmart gift cards for completion of brain imaging, lab&#xD;
      visits and 1 day of monitoring mother's blood pressure at home.&#xD;
