      The purpose of the study is to compare the results of LASIK surgery when using&#xD;
      wavefront-guided excimer laser treatment compared to wavefront optimized excimer laser&#xD;
      treatment in patients with nearsightedness with and without astigmatism&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This is a research study comparing the outcomes of LASIK surgery for nearsightedness when&#xD;
      using the two different excimer laser technologies. Patients will have both eyes treated with&#xD;
      the Alcon WaveLight Allegretto excimer laser. You will be one of 150 sighted patients at&#xD;
      Stanford to undergo treatment in this clinical research trial. This will be a prospective,&#xD;
      randomized, research study in which up to 300 consecutive eyes scheduled to undergo excimer&#xD;
      laser in situ keratomileusis (LASIK) using one laser technology in the first eye and the&#xD;
      second laser technology in the fellow eye for the correction of myopia (nearsightedness) with&#xD;
      or without astigmatism will be enrolled. The choice of which eye receives the wavefront&#xD;
      guided technology and which eye receives the wavefront-optimized technology will be&#xD;
      randomized prior to enrollment. Randomization will be done according to a randomization&#xD;
      schedule. You will know which eye is being treated with which each technology. The&#xD;
      randomization will determine only whether your right or left eye is treated with the&#xD;
      wavefront guided technology. The other eye will be treated with wavefront-optimized laser&#xD;
      technology. You have a fifty percent chance of having your left eye treated with custom&#xD;
      wavefront guided technology as your right eye. Subjects will undergo bilateral (both eyes at&#xD;
      once) LASIK treatments using the Alcon WaveLight Allegretto excimer laser. All subjects will&#xD;
      be followed for one year after the vision correction procedure. Subjects scheduled to undergo&#xD;
      LASIK for the correction of myopia (nearsightedness) with or without astigmatism will be&#xD;
      screened for eligibility. Eligible subjects will be examined preoperatively to establish a&#xD;
      baseline for ocular condition (the general health and glasses prescription of the eyes).&#xD;
      Postoperatively, subjects will undergo an ophthalmic evaluation (complete eye examination) at&#xD;
      regular intervals as specified in this protocol. Retreatments (a second operation on the same&#xD;
      eye for residual nearsightedness) will not be allowed during the first twelve months of this&#xD;
      study. If you elect to undergo a retreatment of your LASIK surgery prior to the 12-month&#xD;
      post-operative visit, the retreated eye will be exited from the study as of the retreatment&#xD;
      date.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Any significant new finding developed during the course of the research which may relate to&#xD;
      the subject's willingness to continue participation will be provided to the subject or&#xD;
      subject's representative in a timely manner.&#xD;
