      This study was conducted to determine if the bioavailability of clindamycin and its&#xD;
      metabolite clindamycin sulfoxide are altered by the concentration of BPO or the absence of&#xD;
      methylparaben. This study compared the investigational study product and 2 marketed products:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  CLN 1%-BPO 3% Gel (clindamycin 1%-BPO 3%), methylparaben-free&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Topical Gel (clindamycin 1%-BPO 5%), methylparaben-preserved (Topical Gel-MP)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Once Daily Gel ((clindamycin 1%-BPO 5%), methylparaben-free (Topical Gel-MPF)&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Clindamycin and benzoyl peroxide (BPO) are both well-known treatments for acne vulgaris&#xD;
      (acne) and are available as single-entity and fixed-dose combination products. The same&#xD;
      excipients are used in the gel vehicle formulations, except inclusion of the preservative&#xD;
      methylparaben in the vehicle is dependent on geographic region. While these products have&#xD;
      been shown to be well tolerated, effective combination therapies for acne,&#xD;
      concentration-dependent cutaneous irritation has been associated with the use of BPO.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clindamycin 1%-benzoyl peroxide 3% gel (CLN 1%-BPO 3%) for the topical treatment of acne was&#xD;
      developed. CLN 1%-BPO 3% contains the same concentration of clindamycin and a lower&#xD;
      concentration of BPO than currently-marketed products, and CLN 1%-BPO 3% is formulated&#xD;
      without methylparaben.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A study to evaluate the plasma concentrations of clindamycin and its metabolites after&#xD;
      topical gel was applied once daily for 4 weeks in subjects with moderate-to-severe acne&#xD;
      showed that the absorption of clindamycin and its metabolite clindamycin sulfoxide were&#xD;
      comparable between Topical Gel and a representative single entity product with the same&#xD;
      clindamycin concentration. An in vitro skin penetration study demonstrated that there were no&#xD;
      significant differences in the delivery of clindamycin in and through the skin following&#xD;
      application of either CLN 1%-BPO 3% or topical gel; therefore, the presence of BPO in the&#xD;
      formulation at either 3% or 5% did not have an effect on the percutaneous absorption of&#xD;
      clindamycin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Benzoyl peroxide has been shown to be absorbed by the skin where it is converted to benzoic&#xD;
      acid. Following topical application, less than 2% of the dose enters systemic circulation as&#xD;
      benzoic acid. The transepidermal delivery of BPO is dependent on concentration and no&#xD;
      systemic toxicity is expected due to rapid renal clearance of benzoic acid. Benzoic acid is&#xD;
      frequently utilized as a preservative or to adjust the pH in food, cosmetics, and medicinal&#xD;
      products; therefore, the limited systemic absorption from CLN 1%-BPO 3% is not expected to&#xD;
      notably increase exposure to benzoic acid. Due to the low potential for systemic toxicity and&#xD;
      the limited utility of assessing plasma concentrations of benzoic acid, the systemic exposure&#xD;
      was not evaluated in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Systemic exposure to clindamycin has been associated with severe cases of diarrhea, bloody&#xD;
      diarrhea and colitis (including pseudomembranous colitis), which could be fatal. Several&#xD;
      studies conducted with single-entity and fixed-combination topical clindamycin-containing&#xD;
      products have determined that systemic absorption of clindamycin is low; however, there have&#xD;
      been documented cases of colitis after topical administration of clindamycin phosphate.&#xD;
      Clindamycin phosphate is rapidly hydrolyzed in vivo to clindamycin, the active parent&#xD;
      compound. Topical application of Clindagel (clindamycin phosphate 1% gel) equivalent to 3 to&#xD;
      12 grams once daily for 5 days resulted in peak plasma clindamycin concentrations that were&#xD;
      less than 5.5ng/mL. Multiple topical applications of Cleocin T (clindamycin phosphate at a&#xD;
      concentration equivalent to 10mg/mL) resulted in clindamycin serum levels ranging from 0 to 3&#xD;
      ng/mL. The mean systemic bioavailability of clindamycin is less than 1%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As there exists a potential for different topical formulations to have greater systemic&#xD;
      exposure to the active ingredients than currently marketed products, this study was conducted&#xD;
      to determine if the bioavailability of clindamycin and its metabolite clindamycin sulfoxide&#xD;
      are altered by the concentration of BPO or the absence of methylparaben. This study compared&#xD;
      the investigational study product and 2 marketed products:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  CLN 1%-BPO 3% Gel (clindamycin 1%-BPO 3%), methylparaben-free&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Topical Gel (clindamycin 1%-BPO 5%), methylparaben-preserved (Topical Gel-MP)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Once Daily Gel ((clindamycin 1%-BPO 5%), methylparaben-free (Topical Gel-MPF)&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Capable of understanding and willing to provide signed and dated written voluntary&#xD;
             informed consent (and HIPAA authorization) before any protocol-specific procedures&#xD;
             were performed. Subjects under the legal age of consent in the state where the study&#xD;
             was conducted must have provided assent and have had the written informed consent of a&#xD;
             parent or guardian.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Male or female 12 to 45 years of age at time of consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Moderate-to-severe facial acne, defined as an ISGA score of 3 or greater.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Able to complete the study and to comply with study instructions.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Sexually-active females of childbearing potential participating in the study must have&#xD;
             agreed to use a medically-acceptable method of contraception while receiving&#xD;
             protocol-assigned product. A woman of childbearing potential was defined as one who is&#xD;
             biologically capable of becoming pregnant, including perimenopausal women who are less&#xD;
             than 2 years from their last menses. Acceptable contraceptive methods included the&#xD;
             following:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Hormonal contraception, including oral, injectable, or implantable methods started at&#xD;
             least 3 months prior to screening. If hormonal contraception was started less than 3&#xD;
             months prior to screening, then a form of nonhormonal contraception should have been&#xD;
             added until the third continuous month of hormonal contraception had been completed.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Two forms of reliable nonhormonal contraception, to include the use of either an&#xD;
             intrauterine device plus a reliable barrier method or 2 reliable barrier methods.&#xD;
             Reliable barrier methods include condoms or diaphragms. A cervical cap is also a&#xD;
             reliable barrier method, provided the female subject has never given birth vaginally.&#xD;
             The combined use of a condom and spermicide constitute 2 forms of acceptable&#xD;
             nonhormonal contraception, provided that they are both used properly. The use of&#xD;
             spermicide alone and the improper use of condoms are inferior methods of&#xD;
             contraception. Subjects with surgical sterilization, including tubal sterilization or&#xD;
             partner's vasectomy, must have used a form of nonhormonal contraception. A barrier&#xD;
             method or sterilization plus spermicide was acceptable.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Women who were not currently sexually active must have agreed to use a&#xD;
             medically-acceptable method of contraception should they have become sexually active&#xD;
             while participating in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Female who was pregnant, trying to become pregnant, or breast feeding.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participation in any investigational study within 4 weeks of Day 1 or who were&#xD;
             scheduled to participate in another investigational study in the next 2 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Used prohibited medications within specified time period before Day 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Currently using any medication that, in the opinion of the investigator, may affect&#xD;
             the evaluation of the study product or place the subject at undue risk.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History or evidence of skin conditions other than acne (eg, eczema, rosacea,&#xD;
             seborrheic dermatitis, birthmarks, tattoos) that would interfere with study&#xD;
             evaluations.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History or presence of regional enteritis or inflammatory bowel disease (eg,&#xD;
             ulcerative colitis, pseudomembranous colitis, chronic diarrhea, celiac disease,&#xD;
             Crohn's disease, or history of antibiotic-associated colitis) or similar symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Had any major illness within 4 weeks of Day 1.&#xD;
