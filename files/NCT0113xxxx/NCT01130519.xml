      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  At the present time, there are no drugs that have been proven to work in patients with&#xD;
           papillary kidney cancer that has spread (metastasized) beyond the kidneys. Researchers&#xD;
           are interested in determining whether the combination of the drugs bevacizumab and&#xD;
           erlotinib can be used to treat metastatic papillary kidney cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Hereditary Leiomyomatosis and Renal Cell Carcinoma (HLRCC) is an inherited type of&#xD;
           papillary kidney cancer (it runs in families). Papillary kidney cancer can also occur&#xD;
           sporadically, or without a family connection. More research is needed to determine&#xD;
           whether treatments for papillary kidney cancer, such as bevacizumab and erlotinib, work&#xD;
           in inherited or sporadic types of kidney cancer, and if so, whether there are any&#xD;
           differences.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      -To determine the effectiveness of the combination of bevacizumab and erlotinib as a&#xD;
      treatment for patients with (1) metastatic HLRCC kidney cancer and (2) metastatic kidney&#xD;
      cancer not associated with HLRCC (or sporadic papillary RCC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Individuals 18 years of age or older who have been diagnosed with papillary kidney&#xD;
           cancer that has spread beyond the kidneys.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants may have either HLRCC or sporadic papillary kidney cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be screened with a full medical history, physical examination, blood&#xD;
           and urine tests, and CT and other scans to evaluate tumor size and treatment options.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will receive 28-day treatment cycles of bevacizumab (given intravenously&#xD;
           every 2 weeks) and erlotinib (a tablet taken by mouth daily).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Every cycle, participants will return for regular blood and urine tests. Every other&#xD;
           cycle, participants will have imaging scans to assess tumor size and response to&#xD;
           treatment. Female participants who have uterine fibroid tumors related to their kidney&#xD;
           cancer may have additional scans to assess tumor size and response to treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will continue to receive treatment on the study until their tumors grow or&#xD;
           spread to new areas (disease progression), intolerable side effects develop, a better&#xD;
           treatment option becomes available, the study closes, it is unsafe to continue&#xD;
           treatment, or the participant decides not to remain in the study.&#xD;

      Background&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Hereditary Leiomyomatosis and Renal Cell Cancer (HLRCC) is a familial cancer syndrome&#xD;
           characterized by a propensity for developing renal cancer, and uterine and cutaneous&#xD;
           leiomyomas. The kidney cancer associated with HLRCC is clinically aggressive and is&#xD;
           characterized by unique histopathologic features that are sometimes described as type 2&#xD;
           papillary RCC.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Germline mutations in the fumarate hydratase (FH) gene are the genetic hallmark of&#xD;
           HLRCC. Mutational inactivation of FH has been shown to result in VHL-independent&#xD;
           upregulation of hypoxia inducible factor (HIF) and its downstream transcriptional&#xD;
           targets.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The recognition that HIF upregulation may play an important role in the formation and&#xD;
           propagation of renal cancer associated with HLRCC suggests that interventions directed&#xD;
           against components of this pathway, such as VEGF and TGF-Alpha/EGFR, may be of benefit&#xD;
           in this patient population.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  We propose to test the hypothesis that dual VEGF/EGFR blockade with&#xD;
           bevacizumab/erlotinib is likely to be clinically active in patients with HLRCC&#xD;
           associated RCC as well as those with sporadic papillary sporadic RCC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objective&#xD;
&#xD;
      -To determine the overall response rate (RECIST) in patients with 1) metastatic RCC&#xD;
      associated with HLRCC and 2) metastatic sporadic/non-HLRCC papillary renal cancer treated&#xD;
      with a combination of bevacizumab and erlotinib&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Diagnosis of advanced RCC associated with HLRCC (cohorts 1 and 3) or sporadic/non-HLRCC&#xD;
           papillary RCC (cohorts 2 and 4)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  ECOG PS 0-2&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Measurable disease, consistent with RECIST 1.1&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  No history of major bleeding, recent or active myocardial ischemia, GI perforation,&#xD;
           cerebrovascular accidents or other significant intercurrent illness&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  No coagulopathy or bleeding diathesis&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  No recent surgery (&lt; 4 weeks or inadequately healed surgical scars)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Adequate organ function&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Adequate liver function (total bilirubin &lt;= 1.5 mg/dL or &lt; 3 x upper limit of normal&#xD;
           (ULN) in subjects with Gilbert s disease, and AST (SGOT) / ALT (SGPT) 2.5 x ULN&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Adequate renal function (creatinine &lt;= 2.0 x ULN or creatinine clearance &gt; 30 mL/min&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Neutrophils &gt;1500/microL and platelets &gt;100,000&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  No brain metastases&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  No more than 2 prior regimens containing a VEGF-pathway inhibitor; no prior therapy with&#xD;
           bevacizumab&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Ability to understand and sign informed consent&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients will receive a fixed starting dose of bevacizumab (10mg/kg IV every 2 weeks)&#xD;
           and erlotinib (150mg/day po). Dose reductions and drug interruptions for unacceptable&#xD;
           toxicity will be allowed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients will be evaluated for response every 8 weeks using RECIST criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The study is based on an open label Simon two-stage minmax design in two cohorts, 1)&#xD;
           cohort 1- patients with HLRCC, and 2) cohort 2- patients with sporadic papillary RCC. In&#xD;
           each cohort, 13 patients will be accrued in the first stage and will accrue a maximum of&#xD;
           20 patients. Accrual into and analysis of the two cohorts will be independent.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Following completion of accrual to cohorts 1 and 2, the study was expanded to include&#xD;
           two additional cohorts- Cohort 3 (HLRCC patients and Cohort 4 (patients with&#xD;
           sporadic/non HLRCC papillary RCC) to better estimate the overall response rate and to&#xD;
           perform additional exploratory biomarker analyses. Up to 20 additional evaluable&#xD;
           patients will be included in each of these cohorts.&#xD;
