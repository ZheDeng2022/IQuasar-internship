  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Vascular calcification and endothelial dysfunction (ED) contribute to the development of&#xD;
      cardiovascular disease (CVD) in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). Sevelamer, a&#xD;
      non-calcium based phosphate binder, has been shown to attenuate cardiovascular calcification&#xD;
      in CKD patients while the exact mechanism has not been clarified.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study was designed to investigate the effect of short-term sevelamer treatment on both&#xD;
      serum FGF23 levels concentrations and ED seen in CKD patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The researchers investigated the relationship between plasma FGF23 levels and the forearm&#xD;
      blood flow response to ischemia in the forearm in a sizable series of incident stage 3-4 CKD&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;

      CKD stage 4 patients older than 18 years of age and willing to participate to the study were&#xD;
      screened. Those who had serum phosphorus &gt; 5.5 mg/dl were evaluated for the study. Patients&#xD;
      with diabetes mellitus, history of coronary artery disease, smokers and those taking statins&#xD;
      or renin-angiotensin blockers were excluded because of the effect of these factors on&#xD;
      endothelial dysfunction. Of 192 screened patients 100 met the study criteria and were&#xD;
      included in this study. Thirty-seven healthy subjects were studied as controls. The ethical&#xD;
      committee of Gulhane School of Medicine approved the study and written informed consent was&#xD;
      obtained from all patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This was a randomized study conducted from 2008 through 2010 in Gulhane School of Medicine.&#xD;
      The Outpatient Clinic of Department of Nephrology is a tertiary referral center. At&#xD;
      admission, most patients were untreated (including phosphate binders) or treated only with&#xD;
      antihypertensive agents. After the first evaluation, patients receiving phosphate binders&#xD;
      (n=17) underwent a 2-week washout period. Patients who developed a phosphate level &gt;5.5 mg/dl&#xD;
      during this period were included in the study. Patients were randomly assigned in 1:1 ratio&#xD;
      to receive sevelamer (Renagel capsule) or calcium acetate (Phos Ex tablet). The treatment&#xD;
      phase was 8 weeks. During the study period serum calcium and phosphorus concentration were&#xD;
      measured every 2 weeks and the dose of phosphate binders were titrated to achieve a serum&#xD;
      phosphorus concentration &lt; 5.5 mg/dl. The starting dose for sevelamer was 1-2 capsules (800&#xD;
      mg) three times a day and for calcium acetate (1000 mg) 1 tablet three times a day. The&#xD;
      medications were given with meal and the doses were increased as needed. Patients were not&#xD;
      given calcitriol during the study period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fasting blood samples were taken before and after the study to measure serum creatinine,&#xD;
      serum albumin, hs-CRP, insulin, 25 (OH) Vit D, iPTH, lipid profile and serum FGF-23&#xD;
      concentration. Additionally, flow-mediated dilatation (FMD) and Intima Media Thickness (IMT)&#xD;
      were also evaluated before and after the study.&#xD;
