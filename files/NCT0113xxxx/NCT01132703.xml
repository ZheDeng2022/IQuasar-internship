  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of different&#xD;
      dose levels of glyburide for injection, administered as a bolus dose followed by a 3-day&#xD;
      continuous infusion. The secondary objectives are to assess the pharmacokinetics (PK) of&#xD;
      glyburide and blood glucose and serum insulin pharmacodynamic (PD) responses to glyburide.&#xD;

    <description>An adverse event (AE) is defined as any untoward medical occurence such as a sign, symptom, and/or laboratory finding that is concurrent with the use of a drug in humans. A serious adverse event is any AE that is fatal, life-threatening, requires or prolongs hospital stay, results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity, a congenital anomaly or birth defect, or an important medical event</description>

&#xD;
          7. Use any prescription medication within 14 days prior to randomization, or&#xD;
             nonprescription drugs within 7 days. Exceptions may be made by the medical monitor on&#xD;
             a case-by-case basis.&#xD;
&#xD;

          9. A positive hepatitis virus test (Hepatitis B virus surface antigen or hepatitis C&#xD;
             virus antibody) or a positive human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) antibody test at&#xD;
             screening. If the HIV test is positive, the subject will be informed privately and&#xD;
             referred for additional counseling.&#xD;
