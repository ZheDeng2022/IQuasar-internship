  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with cutaneous T cell lymphoma experience refractory and progressive disease despite&#xD;
      current treatment, necessitating chronic disease management. In addition, there needs to be&#xD;
      greater emphasis on combination treatment, which correlates with increased response rate,&#xD;
      more rapid onset of response, and decreased side effect profile compared to monotherapy. The&#xD;
      goal for the use of Lenalidomide as an adjuvant treatment in patients with refractory&#xD;
      cutaneous T cell lymphoma is to increase response rates, maintain a durable long-term&#xD;
      response, relieve associated symptoms, and minimize toxic side effects.&#xD;

    <description>The primary efficacy measure is the response rate (RR) based on skin scoring using mSWAT (modified severity weighted assessment tool), Sezary cell count, and lymph node assessment. Response rate is defined as the number of responders divided by the number of treated patients. A responder is defined as any patient who exhibits a confirmed complete or partial response.&#xD;
• Patients will be treated until progressive disease is demonstrated by ≥ 25% increase of SWAT score.</description>
