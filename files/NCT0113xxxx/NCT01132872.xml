      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Researchers studying new treatments for major depressive disorder are looking at how&#xD;
           medications to treat depression act on the brain chemical serotonin, which interacts&#xD;
           with specific serotonin receptors on brain cells. New methods of studying serotonin&#xD;
           receptors in the brain may help provide a better understanding of depression and&#xD;
           treatment options.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A new radioactive chemical called [11C]CUMI may be useful for studying serotonin&#xD;
           receptors in the brain. By using positron emission tomography (PET) scanning to see how&#xD;
           [11C]CUMI bonds with serotonin receptors, researchers will investigate whether [11C]CUMI&#xD;
           can be used to study depression and how antidepressant medications work.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To determine the usefulness of [11C]CUMI as a method of studying serotonin receptors in the&#xD;
      brain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Healthy individuals between 18 and 65 who have no history of psychiatric illness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  This study requires 8 outpatient visits to the NIH clinic.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Visit 1: Participants will have a full physical examination and medical history, as well&#xD;
           as a psychiatric evaluation and questions about alcohol and drug use. Other tests will&#xD;
           include blood and urine samples and an electrocardiogram (EKG). Testing will take&#xD;
           approximately 3 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Visit 2: Participants will have a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan to evaluate&#xD;
           brain function and activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Visit 3: Participants will have a PET scan, in which a small amount of the radioactive&#xD;
           chemical [11C]CUMI will be injected through an intravenous (IV) catheter, and will have&#xD;
           another IV line put in place to draw regular blood samples during the scan. The scan&#xD;
           will last approximately 4 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Visits 4-8: Participants will have regular blood tests after the scan between days 1-3&#xD;
           and at about weeks 1, 2, 3, and 4. The blood tests will check muscle, heart, and liver&#xD;
           function.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Eighteen million people in the United States are currently suffering from Major Depressive&#xD;
      Disorder, which is characterized by episodes of low mood, poor self attitude and poor&#xD;
      vitality. Of those suffering from Major Depressive Disorder (MDD), only one third completely&#xD;
      improve, but even among these cases, there is a waiting period of several weeks or more&#xD;
      during which antidepressants take effect. Our inability to adequately treat MDD is evident in&#xD;
      its being ranked number one in Disability Adjusted Life Years (DALY) among persons aged&#xD;
      15-44. Given this profound burden, improving our understanding of the molecular basis of MDD&#xD;
      is of utmost importance in the development of novel antidepressant medications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Serotoninergic neurotransmission is implicated in MDD, as demonstrated by the relative&#xD;
      success of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). SSRIs block the reuptake of&#xD;
      serotonin through the serotonin transporter, which then increases serotonin at the synaptic&#xD;
      cleft. Serotonin then binds to 5-HT(1A) receptors, which are G-protein coupled receptors that&#xD;
      are present both presynaptically and postsynaptically. Presynaptically, these receptors act&#xD;
      as autoinhibitory receptors, triggering decreased firing rates and decreased serotonin&#xD;
      release. This autoinhibitory mechanism is believed to be the reason why patients experience a&#xD;
      delay in symptomatic improvement after initiation of SSRIs. Serotonin binding to postsynaptic&#xD;
      receptors mediates symptomatic improvement of depression. Multiple positron emission&#xD;
      tomography (PET) studies on 5-HT(1A) have been published. However, none of these studies use&#xD;
      5-HT(1A) agonists, which are specific for the high affinity, G-protein coupled and active&#xD;
      state of the 5-HT(1A) receptor. We would therefore like to establish the use of the 5-HT(1A)&#xD;
      radiolabelled agonist, [(11)C]CUMI, here at NIH.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to perform whole body PET studies in healthy volunteers in order&#xD;
      to estimate radiation absorbed doses for [(11)C]CUMI. Future experiments will include studies&#xD;
      on Major Depressive Disorder.&#xD;

             this study would be above the allowable limits.&#xD;
&#xD;
         14. Positive urine drug screen.&#xD;
&#xD;
         15. Inability to lie flat on camera bed for about 2.5 hours.&#xD;
