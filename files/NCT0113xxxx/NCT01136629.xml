      Hypothesis -&#xD;
&#xD;
      The developments of solar lentigine and melasma are due to mutations in keratinocytes that&#xD;
      drive the production and transfer of pigment from melanocytes to keratinocytes.&#xD;

      Aims -&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Characterize and classify lentigines and mealsma from a clinical and physiological point&#xD;
           of view. This will help us to better understand the cellular processes leading to the&#xD;
           development of lentigines (also referred to as Senile or Solar Lentigo).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Proper characterization and classification of lentigines and melasma would facilitate&#xD;
           the development of models to study and find solutions to treat these lesions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis - The developments of solar lentigine and melasma are due to mutations in&#xD;
      keratinocytes that drive the production and transfer of pigment from melanocytes to&#xD;
      keratinocytes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology -&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients, 21 - 80 year old, who have elected to undergo a plastic surgery will be enrolled.&#xD;
      Some patient information (i.e. age, sex, race, family history, life-style related to&#xD;
      sun-exposure) will be collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After surgery, hyper-pigmented spots will be excised and stored in individual containers for&#xD;
      subsequent experimental procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before surgery, the area containing the hyper-pigmented spots will be photographed using a&#xD;
      high resolution digital camera and assessed using optical probes (Spectrophotometer to&#xD;
      measure skin chromophores, mexameter to measure the melanin and erythema indexes and a&#xD;
      diffuse reflectance spectrometer to measure hemoglobin, deoxyhemoglobin and melanin).&#xD;
&#xD;
      After surgery, excised skin samples will be processed for histological assessments, others&#xD;
      for gene or protein expression analysis, and yet another group will be used to isolate&#xD;
      keratinocyte and melanocyte to further study their behavior and response to stimuli in&#xD;
      primary cultures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical assessment of Hyperpigmented lesions:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lentigo Morphological assessment (before surgery)&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Macules vary in color from yellow, light-brown to black, depending on under-lying skin&#xD;
           type&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Size varies from 1mm to greater than 1 cm&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Appear on sun-exposed areas (face, neck, etc)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Morphological assessment (before surgery)&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Irregular light to dark brown to gray brown macules or patches on sun-exposed areas&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. When examine with Wood's lamp, melasma can be classified into 3 types, epidermal,&#xD;
           dermal, or mixed, based on intensity of pigments, in which epidermal melasma has darker&#xD;
           color than derma melasma. Mixed melasma has a mixture of both dark and light&#xD;
           pigmentations&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Melanocytes in melasma lesion have an increase in the number of mitochondria, golgi&#xD;
           apparatus, rough ER, and ribosomes&#xD;
&#xD;
      Spectrophotometer will be used to measure the optical properties of spots and control areas&#xD;
      (without the spot)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample processing&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. RNA extraction&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Histology&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Isolation of Keratinocytes, and Melanocytes.&#xD;
