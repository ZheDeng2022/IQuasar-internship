  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - The investigational anti-cancer drug AZD6244 prevents a protein found in rectal cancer from&#xD;
      working properly, which may slow tumor growth and allow radiation and chemotherapy treatments&#xD;
      to destroy more cancer cells. Researchers are interested in determining whether AZD6244 can&#xD;
      be used to improve treatment outcomes in individuals who have rectal cancer that has spread&#xD;
      outside the rectum into the surrounding pelvis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To determine safe and effective doses of AZD6244, along with radiation and chemotherapy, to&#xD;
      treat rectal cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Individuals at least 18 years of age who have been diagnosed with rectal cancer that has&#xD;
      spread outside the inner wall of the rectum or into lymph nodes in the pelvis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Eligible participants will be screened with a physical examination, blood and tumor&#xD;
           samples, and imaging studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will receive AZD6244 twice a day by mouth for 1 full week (7 days) before&#xD;
           starting radiation and chemotherapy and every week thereafter until the end of the&#xD;
           radiation and chemotherapy treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will have radiation therapy daily, 5 days per week, for approximately 6&#xD;
           weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will receive chemotherapy (capecitabine) twice daily, 5 days per week, for&#xD;
           approximately 6 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Approximately 4 to 8 weeks after completing the AZD6244, radiation, and chemotherapy&#xD;
           treatment, participants may have surgery to remove any tumors and affected lymph nodes.&#xD;
           This surgery is not part of the treatment delivered on this protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will have a follow-up exam 3 weeks after the end of treatment, every 3&#xD;
           months for the first year, and then in the second and third year after the end of&#xD;
           treatment. These visits will involve a full medical examination and imaging studies.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Local recurrences of rectal cancer are morbid and difficult to manage effectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Colorectal cancers frequently harbor RAS mutations and EGF/EGFR over-expression.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  AZD6244 is an orally available selective, adenosine triphosphate uncompetitive inhibitor&#xD;
           of MEK1/2 that sensitizes tumor cells to radiation in vitro and in vivo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To define the maximum tolerable dose of AZD6244 Hyd-Sulfate delivered BID, 7 days per&#xD;
           week, in combination with radiation therapy (RT) and Capecitabine in patients with&#xD;
           locally advanced adenocarcinoma of the rectum without distant metastases.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To define the dose-limiting toxicities and toxicity profile associated with&#xD;
           administration of AZD6244 Hyd-Sulfate delivered BID, 7 days per week in combination with&#xD;
           RT and Capecitabine&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the pharmacokinetics of AZD6244 delivered alone and in combination with&#xD;
           Capecitabine 825 mg/m(2) PO BID.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To obtain exploratory information regarding the pathologic response rate obtained after&#xD;
           treatment with the MTD of AZD6244 Hyd-Sulfate in combination with Capecitabine and 50.4&#xD;
           Gy of RT.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine if changes in phosphorylated ERK (pERK) in peripheral blood mononuclear&#xD;
           cells correlates to changes in pERK in rectal tumors in the setting of treatment with&#xD;
           AZD6244.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To perform an exploratory analysis to determine if the presence of activating mutations&#xD;
           in RAS or BRAF in tumor or changes in plasma transforming growth factor-alpha (TGFalpha)&#xD;
           levels and tumor pERK/total ERK with AZD6244 treatment alone and after AZD6244 in&#xD;
           combination with Capecitabine and RT predicts for down staging or pathologic response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Histologically or cytologically confirmed locally advanced, non-metastatic&#xD;
           adenocarcinoma of the rectum (clinical stage T3AnyN, T4AnyN, or AnyTN+).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Age greater than or equal to 18 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  ECOG performance status less than or equal to 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Normal organ and marrow function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  All patients will receive 50.4 Gy of RT to the pelvis and rectal tumor delivered&#xD;
           concurrently with Capecitabine and AZD6244. AZD6244 will be delivered BID daily, 7 days&#xD;
           per week, in a dose escalated fashion. AZD6244 will begin one week prior to Capecitabine&#xD;
           and RT and will conclude on the last day of Capecitabine and RT.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Capecitabine will be delivered at 825 mg/m(2) PO every 12 hours, 5 days per week,&#xD;
           starting on the first day of RT and continuing until the last day of RT.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Biopsies of tumor tissue will be obtained prior to treatment, after one week of AZD6244,&#xD;
           and after one week of AZD6244, RT, and Capecitabine for correlative assays.&#xD;
