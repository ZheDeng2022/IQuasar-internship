    <textblock>
      This study will test the hypothesis whether patients with unclear-onset stroke (UnCLOS)&#xD;
      treated with thrombolysis could achieve a prespecified rate of good clinical outcome. The&#xD;
      secondary hypothesis is that the efficacy outcomes in UnCLOS group would be superior to those&#xD;
      in historical UnCLOS group from prospective stroke registries.&#xD;

      1. Study design: A prospective multicenter trial&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Study centers: 6 participating medical centers in South Korea&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Participants: Consecutive patients with acute ischemic stroke visiting the emergency&#xD;
           room within 6 hours of the detection of stroke symptoms&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Methods&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  3 thrombolysis protocols applicable to UnCLOS patients&#xD;
&#xD;
                  1. IV tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) : Conventional intravenous tPA (0.9&#xD;
                     mg/kg, 10% of the dose as a bolus and the remainder over 60 minutes) will be&#xD;
                     administered to patients within 3 hours of first found abnormal time who had&#xD;
                     no arterial occlusion or catheter-inaccessible occlusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
                  2. IV tPA + IA urokinase protocol : Combined intravenous tPA (0.6 mg/kg, 10% of&#xD;
                     the dose as a bolus and the remainder over 30 minutes) with intra-arterial&#xD;
                     urokinase will be administered to those within 3 hours from first found&#xD;
                     abnormal time who had catheter-accessible arterial occlusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
                  3. IA UK protocol : Intra-arterial urokinase will be given to those between 3 and&#xD;
                     6 hours after first found abnormal time who had catheter-accessible arterial&#xD;
                     occlusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Outcome variables&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Safety outcomes Symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) within 48 hours from&#xD;
                thrombolytic therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Efficacy outcomes&#xD;
&#xD;
                  1. Long-term clinical outcomes (modified Rankin Scale) at 3 months&#xD;
&#xD;
                  2. Secondary efficacy outcomes : Good vs. Poor outcomes according to mRS&#xD;
                     responder analysis, Early neurological improvement, Immediate and 5-day&#xD;
                     recanalization on MRA or CTA&#xD;
