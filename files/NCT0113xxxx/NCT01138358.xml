      RATIONALE: Gathering information about experiences of episodic breathlessness in patients&#xD;
      with advanced disease may help doctors learn more about the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE: This clinical trial is studying experiences of episodic breathlessness in patients&#xD;
      with lung cancer or other advanced disease.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To explore the experiences of episodic breathlessness in patients with advanced disease&#xD;
           (i.e., primary and secondary lung cancer, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [COPD],&#xD;
           chronic heart failure [CHF], and motor neuron disease [MND]).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To explore the impact of episodic breathlessness on daily living.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To explore the individual coping strategies to reduce burden of episodic breathlessness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients undergo 1 to 2 interviews to collect data on experiences of breathlessness (in&#xD;
      general, at rest, and on exertion including symptom description, interpretation, and&#xD;
      meaning); experiences of episodic breathlessness (EB) (at rest and on exertion including&#xD;
      symptom description, interpretation, meaning, and definition); trajectory/course of EB&#xD;
      (onset/relief, time, and severity) and different types/trajectories of EB; impact of EB&#xD;
      (burden, emotional reaction [panic and fear], care burden, and dependencies); triggers of EB&#xD;
      (causes, situation, and settings) and predictability of EB; management of EB (coping&#xD;
      strategies, non-pharmacological and pharmacological management [including different&#xD;
      applications], worsen/relief, role of care in coping, and emotional/behavior strategies;&#xD;
      views on and experiences with services/professionals in management of EB and response to&#xD;
      professional advice; and attitudes towards the future, course of the disease, and awareness&#xD;
      of prognosis. At the end of the interview, the patient will be asked to draw a figure that&#xD;
      illustrates the trajectory of the episode. After the interview, a debriefing will be carried&#xD;
      out to give the patient the chance to express worries, potential harm, or any comments about&#xD;
      the interview. In addition to the interviews, further information will be collected including&#xD;
      demographics, diagnosis and co-morbidities, current pharmacological and non-pharmacological&#xD;
      treatments (medical history), functional status (Karnofsky), and breathlessness&#xD;
      characteristics (e.g., intensity, frequency, and duration). The interviews will be&#xD;
      tape-recorded, transcribed verbatim, and analyzed concurrently using Framework Approach.&#xD;
