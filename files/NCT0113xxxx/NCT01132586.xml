      This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of lenalidomide when given together&#xD;
      with cytarabine and idarubicin in treating patients with acute myeloid leukemia. Biological&#xD;
      therapies, such as lenalidomide, may stimulate the immune system in different ways and stop&#xD;
      cancer cells from growing. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as cytarabine and idarubicin,&#xD;
      work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by&#xD;
      stopping them from dividing. Giving lenalidomide together with cytarabine and idarubicin may&#xD;
      kill more cancer cells.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of lenalidomide in combination with&#xD;
      conventional chemotherapy in two separate cohorts of patients with 1) relapsed or refractory&#xD;
      acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and 2) age &gt;= 60 with untreated AML and recommend starting doses&#xD;
      for phase II studies of this combination of agents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To define the qualitative and quantitative toxicities of these combinations of agents in&#xD;
      regard to organ specificity, time course, predictability, and reversibility.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To document the therapeutic response of these combinations of agents in patients with&#xD;
      poor risk AML.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To conduct pharmacodynamic studies to investigate the potential mechanism of&#xD;
      lenalidomide activity in this trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of lenalidomide.&#xD;
&#xD;
      INDUCTION:&#xD;
&#xD;
      COHORT I: Patients receive lenalidomide orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-21, cytarabine&#xD;
      intravenously (IV) continuously over 96 hours on days 5-8, and idarubicin IV over 1 hour on&#xD;
      days 5-7.&#xD;
&#xD;
      COHORT II: Patients receive lenalidomide PO QD on days 1-21, cytarabine IV continuously over&#xD;
      24 hours on days 5-11, and idarubicin as above.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with residual disease on day 18 undergo a second course of induction therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CONSOLIDATION:&#xD;
&#xD;
      COHORT I: Patients receive lenalidomide PO QD on days 1-14, idarubicin IV over 1 hour on days&#xD;
      5-6, cytarabine IV continuously on days 5-7. Treatment continues for 1 course in the absence&#xD;
      of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      COHORT II: Patients 2 receive 4 courses of consolidation therapy comprising lenalidomide PO&#xD;
      QD on days 1-14 and cytarabine IV every 12 hours on days 5, 7, and 9. Treatment repeats every&#xD;
      28 days for up to 4 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 30 days.&#xD;
