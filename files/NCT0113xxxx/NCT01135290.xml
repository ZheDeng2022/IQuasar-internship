        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The informed consent document and photography release must be read, signed, and dated&#xD;
             by the subject or the subject's legally authorized representative before conducting&#xD;
             any study procedures or exams. In addition, the informed consent and photography&#xD;
             release document must be signed and dated by the individual who consents the subject&#xD;
             before conducting Visit 1. A photocopy of the signed informed consent document must be&#xD;
             provided to the subject, and the original signed document placed in the subject's&#xD;
             chart.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects 18 years of age or older, scheduled to undergo either a medium chemical peel&#xD;
             with 35% TCA or a laser resurfacing. Subjects may be of either sex and of any race or&#xD;
             skin type provided that their skin color, in the opinion of the Investigator, will not&#xD;
             interfere with the study assessments.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Women of child-bearing potential (those who are not premenarchal, not surgically&#xD;
             sterilized [hysterectomy or bilateral oophorectomy], or not post-menopausal) may&#xD;
             participate in the study if they meet all of the following conditions:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  they are not breast feeding&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  undertake a pregnancy test, which must be negative&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  they do not intend to become pregnant during the study&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  they are using adequate birth control methods and they agree to continue using&#xD;
                  those methods for the duration of the study&#xD;
&#xD;
        Adequate birth control methods are defined as: hormonal-topical, oral, implantable, or&#xD;
        injectable contraceptives; mechanical-spermicide in conjunction with a barrier such as a&#xD;
        condom or diaphragm; IUD; or, surgical sterilization of partner. For non-sexually active&#xD;
        females, abstinence may be regarded as an adequate method of birth control; however, if the&#xD;
        subject becomes sexually active during the study, she must agree to use an adequate birth&#xD;
        control method as described above for the remainder of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        NOTE: Women who have had a bilateral tubal ligation are not considered to have been&#xD;
        surgically sterilized and must agree to the conditions as specified above.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Willing and able to make all required study visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Able to follow instructions.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Undergo a medium grade chemical peel or fractional resurfacing.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Contraindications or hypersensitivity to the use of the study medications or their&#xD;
             components (e.g., balsam of Peru, castor oil, or phenoxyethanol).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Therapy with another investigational agent within thirty (30) days of Visit 1, or&#xD;
             during the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have taken anticoagulants (blood thinners, including aspirin) within two weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Current smoker.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Use of oral isotretinoin during the past 12 months, systemic steroids, topical&#xD;
             retinoids, or topical corticosteroids within the month prior to the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have any congenital skin disorder which affects keratinocytes, elastin, or collagen.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have any dermatologic disease which may be aggravated or provoked by the wounding&#xD;
             procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Are at risk of keloid or hypertrophic scar formation based on personal or family&#xD;
             history, or skin exam.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have any skin disorder which causes delayed healing.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have any systemic condition that would compromise skin healing.&#xD;
