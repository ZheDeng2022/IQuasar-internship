    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to look at two different referencing systems for total knee&#xD;
      replacement surgery. In anterior referencing system, referencing cuts are made from the front&#xD;
      surface of the femur. This allows for a more exact cut. The anterior referencing system is&#xD;
      more difficult for the surgeon to use. This may increase surgery time. Posterior referencing,&#xD;
      on the other hand, references cuts from the back of the femur. The posterior referencing&#xD;
      system is quick and easy for the surgeon to use. Posterior referencing may lead to notching&#xD;
      of the femur. The risk of notching is very low and may not affect your results. This is a&#xD;
      study that has never been done before. Dr. Heekin uses both referencing systems in his&#xD;
      practice. He would like to determine which knee referencing system allows for greater knee&#xD;
      flexion after surgery. Knee flexion correlates with function and the ability to return to&#xD;
      everyday activities. For example, getting up from a chair, going up and down stairs,&#xD;
      stooping, and kneeling.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Patient is a male or non-pregnant female between the ages of 21-80.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Patient requires cemented primary total knee replacement.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Patient has a diagnosis of osteoarthritis (OA), traumatic arthritis (TA), or avascular&#xD;
             necrosis (AVN).&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Patient has intact collateral ligaments.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Patient has signed and dated an IRB approved study specific consent form.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Patient is able and willing to participate in the study according to the protocol for&#xD;
             the full length of expected term of follow-up, and to follow their physician's&#xD;
             directions.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Patient has failed to respond to conservative treatment modalities.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Patient's contralateral knee is without symptomatic degenerative disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Patient has had a prior procedure of high tibial osteotomy, cruciate ligament&#xD;
             reconstruction or patellectomy of the surgical knee.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Patient is morbidly obese (BMI &gt;30).&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Patient has a deformity at the involved knee greater than 45degrees of flexion, 45&#xD;
             degrees of varus or 45 degrees of valgus.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Patient has an active or suspected latent infection in or about the knee joint.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Patient has a malignancy in the area of the involved knee joint.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Patient has a diagnosed systematic disease that would affect the subject's welfare or&#xD;
             overall outcome of the study (i.e. moderate to severe osteoporosis, Paget's disease,&#xD;
             renal osteodystrophy) or is immunologically suppressed, or receiving steroids in&#xD;
             excess of physiologic dose requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Patient has a neurological deficit, which interferes with the patient's ability to&#xD;
             limit weight bearing or places an extreme load on implant during the healing period.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Female patient is or plans to become pregnant during the course of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Patient has a known sensitivity to device materials.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Patient has prior diagnosis of diabetic or peripheral neuropathy in operative&#xD;
             extremity or other neurologic disease affecting limb strength (i.e. Polymyositis,&#xD;
             multiple sclerosis).&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Patient's bone stock is compromised by disease or infection, which cannot provide&#xD;
             adequate support and/or fixation to the prosthesis.&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Patient has a TKA on the contralateral side less than six months post-op.&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. Patient has participated in an orthopaedic clinical investigation involving the hip or&#xD;
             knee joint in the last 12 months.&#xD;
