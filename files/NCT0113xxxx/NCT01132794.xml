  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Dental procedures such as wisdom tooth removal evoke very high levels of patients' anxiety&#xD;
      and it is, therefore, common practice to provide concomitant pharmacologic sedation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sedative agents can be administered by the oral, rectal, intra muscular and intravenous&#xD;
      routes. The oldest, safest and most convenient route at present is the oral route. However,&#xD;
      as Uygur-Bayramicli et al. mentioned that administering the drugs orally can result in&#xD;
      problems like delayed effect. Intranasal administration is a straightforward procedure. It is&#xD;
      simple and relatively painless. Although it may be objectionable, less patient cooperation is&#xD;
      required than with oral administration, especially in which the child must swallow the&#xD;
      medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Many studies on dental sedation have been carried out by anesthesiologists but there is no&#xD;
      ideal drug that can offer effects of both sedation and analgesia. Some drugs offer only one&#xD;
      effect and others are not safe enough for clinical use. Midazolam, a benzodiazepine drug, is&#xD;
      the traditional choice for sedation, but it has properties such as relatively slow onset and&#xD;
      no analgesia. Propofol is an alkylphenol sedative and hypnotic agent with a rapid onset and&#xD;
      offset. It has been used in patient controlled sedation before. But it has no analgesic&#xD;
      properties. It can provide some antegrade amnesia, but it is not as reliable an amnestic as&#xD;
      the benzodiazepine drugs. Because of these characteristics, propofol often is supplemented&#xD;
      with narcotics and benzodiazepines. Although not irritant, it can cause pain during&#xD;
      intravenous infusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A new drug, an alpha agonist with its relatively high ratio of α2/α1-activity (1620:1 as&#xD;
      compared with 220:1 for clonidine) of theα2 receptor is dexmedetomidine. This property may&#xD;
      lead to more potent effects of both sedation and analgesia without unwanted cardiovascular&#xD;
      effects fromα1 receptor activation. Most of the data evaluating the use of dexmedetomidine in&#xD;
      the intensive care unit (ICU) were obtained in the immediate postoperative period, mainly in&#xD;
      patients who underwent open-heart surgery. Currently, clinicians are awaiting studies in&#xD;
      broader patient populations. In the studies that have been completed to date, sedation has&#xD;
      been attained easily with maintenance of respiratory function. Patients are readily&#xD;
      arousable. There is a minimal increase in blood pressure initially, followed by a slight&#xD;
      decrease in blood pressure. Lower dose ranges, avoidance of rapid bolus injection, and a slow&#xD;
      rate of administration tend to decrease these circulatory side effects. So many clinical&#xD;
      studies have shown that it can be well and safely used intravenously, intramuscularly and&#xD;
      transdermally. Although not an officially technique, there are also reports of intranasal&#xD;
      administration resulting in fairly predictable onset in both adults and children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators propose that intranasal can help to improve postoperative pain relief with&#xD;
      better sedation.&#xD;
