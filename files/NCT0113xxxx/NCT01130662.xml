  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the tolerated dose of the combination of decitabine&#xD;
      and midostaurin as induction (first cycle of chemotherapy) and consolidation (additional&#xD;
      chemotherapy once a patient goes into remission) in people greater than 60 years with newly&#xD;
      diagnosed AML or adult patients with relapsed/refractory disease.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The development of a primarily outpatient treatment option for AML that is also capable of&#xD;
      providing significant disease control is a priority for most clinicians. To address the need&#xD;
      for less toxic, more effective treatments for older patients with AML, the purpose of this&#xD;
      Phase 1 single institution study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of midostaurin and&#xD;
      decitabine administered in combination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Decitabine is an epigenetic modifier of gene expression that has been shown to be&#xD;
      well-tolerated in this population at the dose schedule proposed in this study, with&#xD;
      reasonable efficacy. Although its precise mechanism of action is incompletely understood, it&#xD;
      is postulated to work by reactivating the expression of key tumor suppressor genes silenced&#xD;
      in tumor cells by reversing a pattern of hypermethylation of promotor elements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Midostaurin is an oral agent that has been shown to inhibit FLT3 kinase in preclinical in&#xD;
      vitro and in vivo studies, as well as clinically in patients with both ITD and TKD FLT3&#xD;
      mutations (FLT3mut). Both directly and indirectly, midostaurin also potently inhibits&#xD;
      multiple other molecular targets thought to be important for the pathogenesis of AML. These&#xD;
      targets include VEGFR-1, a VEGF receptor; c-kit; H- and K-ras; as well as the multidrug&#xD;
      resistant gene, MDR.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The addition of midostaurin to a decitabine regimen of previously established efficacy and&#xD;
      tolerability will allow us to evaluate the hypothesis that two drugs that are believed to&#xD;
      work through distinct mechanisms of action may act together to improve the responses of&#xD;
      patients treated with decitabine alone, without significant additional toxicity.&#xD;
