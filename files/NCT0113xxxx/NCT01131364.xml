      This Phase Ib/II study is an openlabel, multicenter study for patients with solid tumors and&#xD;
      breast cancer amenable to anthracyclin therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is divided in two parts:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase I: an open-label, dose escalation study of F16IL2 in combination with doxorubicin for&#xD;
      patients with solid tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase II: a prospective, single-arm, multicentre study of a fixed dose of F16IL2 in&#xD;
      combination with doxorubicin, equivalent to stage 1 of the Simon two-stage phase II design,&#xD;
      for patients with breast cancer amenable to anthracyclin therapy.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Breast cancer is a major cause of cancer mortality, second only to lung cancer as a cause of&#xD;
      cancer death in women. The five-year survival rate for localized breast cancer has increased&#xD;
      from 80 percent in the 1950s to 98 percent today. However, the mortality rate in the most&#xD;
      advanced forms remains unsatisfactory. Indeed, the extensive use of mammography within&#xD;
      screening programs has led to cancers being detected earlier, when early treatments may be&#xD;
      more effective. A greater understanding of the molecular biology and genetic expression of&#xD;
      breast cancer has therefore led to new pre-surgical and post-surgical treatments, including&#xD;
      hormone modulators and monoclonal antibodies. Many of these agents have led to decreased&#xD;
      mortality and disease recurrence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      F16 is a human recombinant antibody fragment in the scFv (single chain Fragment variable)&#xD;
      format that is directed against tenascin C, an angiogenesis marker common to most solid&#xD;
      tumors independent of the tumor type. ScFv(F16) selectively localizes in tumor tissues in&#xD;
      animal models as demonstrated both histologically and during mechanistic studies involving&#xD;
      mice transfected with orthotopic human tumours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IL2, the human cytokine interleukin-2, is a potent stimulator of the immune response. It has&#xD;
      a central role in the regulation of T cell responses and effects on other immune cells such&#xD;
      as natural killer cells, B cells, monocyte/macrophages and neutrophils (Smith, 1988). IL2 can&#xD;
      induce tumor regression through its ability to stimulate a potent cell-mediated immune&#xD;
      response in vivo (Rosenberg, 2000).&#xD;
