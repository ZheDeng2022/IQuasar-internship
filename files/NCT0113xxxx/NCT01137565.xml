        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Male and/or female subjects ≥12 to &lt; 18 years of age (for Cohorts 1, 2, and 3 as&#xD;
             indicated in the study design).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Male and/or non-reproductive female subjects between 18 and 50 years of age, inclusive&#xD;
             (for cohort 4).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Females of non-reproductive potential must have documented medical history (ie,&#xD;
             postmenopausal by history - no menses for 1 year - and follicle-stimulating hormone&#xD;
             value (FSH) consistent with postmenopausal status per laboratory ranges; OR history of&#xD;
             hysterectomy; OR history of bilateral tubal ligation; OR history of bilateral&#xD;
             oophorectomy).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Females of child-bearing potential and females who cannot document non-reproductive&#xD;
             potential must agree to use highly effective methods of birth control for the duration&#xD;
             of the study and for 2 weeks after study drug administration. Males whose partners are&#xD;
             of child bearing potential must agree to use highly effective methods of birth control&#xD;
             for the duration of the study and continuing for 12 weeks after study drug&#xD;
             administration. Highly effective methods of birth control (i.e., those with a failure&#xD;
             rate of less than 1% per year) include sexual abstinence (males, females), vasectomy&#xD;
             or a condom supplemented with the use of a spermicide (males) and occlusive cap&#xD;
             (diaphragm or cervical/vault caps), hormonal birth control, or intrauterine device&#xD;
             (IUD) used by the female partner.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Male subjects whose partners become pregnant during the study must practice sexual&#xD;
             abstinence or use a condom with spermicide for two weeks following study drug&#xD;
             administration to ensure the unborn child is not potentially exposed to AMG 853 via&#xD;
             semen. The pregnant partner information will be reported to Amgen per the Pregnancy&#xD;
             Notification Worksheet.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Intermittent or mild to moderate persistent asthma for the past 3 months (as defined&#xD;

          -  On a stable pharmacologic regimen for the treatment of asthma for at least 3 months&#xD;
             prior to study enrollment and does not anticipate any change to the regimen during the&#xD;
             course of the study.&#xD;

          -  Forced Expiry Volume in 1 second (FEV1) at screening visit ≥ 70% of predicted normal&#xD;
             value (without aid of bronchodilator).&#xD;
&#xD;

             inhaled (up to 400 μg) or nebulized (up to 5 mg) albuterol at the office screening&#xD;
             visit. Subjects unable to demonstrate reversibility during screening, must provide the&#xD;
             most recent evidence of documented reversibility to the Amgen Medical Monitor and the&#xD;
             principal investigator for review.&#xD;

          -  Clinically acceptable physical examination, electrocardiogram (ECG), and clinical&#xD;
             laboratory test values for the population tested. Any abnormal clinical laboratory&#xD;
             results and/or ECG values must be discussed with the Sponsor.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History or evidence of clinically significant disorder, condition or disease that, in&#xD;
