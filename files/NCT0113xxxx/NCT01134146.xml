    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical research study is to find the highest tolerable dose of radiation&#xD;
      that can be given to directly to the pleura (the outer lining of the lungs) using intensity&#xD;
      modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) in patients with MM who have had a pleurectomy.&#xD;

      IMRT:&#xD;
&#xD;
      IMRT is a technique to deliver radiation that allows the radiation beam to be shaped around&#xD;
      the target area.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Radiation Dose Levels:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will be assigned to receive&#xD;
      one of two doses of radiation therapy based on when you joined the study. If the first dose&#xD;
      is tolerated well by the first group of participants in this study, then the next group of&#xD;
      participants will receive the second, higher dose of radiation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Practice Visit:&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will have a practice radiation visit about 6-14 weeks after your surgery. At this visit,&#xD;
      you will have a computed tomography (CT) scan that will be used by the study staff to target&#xD;
      where you will receive the IMRT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A mold will also be made around your body and marks will be made on your skin to help&#xD;
      position your body correctly for the IMRT. This practice visit should take about 1-2 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IMRT Visits:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two (2) weeks after the practice radiation visit, you will begin receiving IMRT. At each&#xD;
      visit, you will lie down in the mold of your body that was made at the practice visit and you&#xD;
      will be lined up for the IMRT using the marks made at the practice visit. The IMRT will then&#xD;
      be delivered. You will receive IMRT every weekday (Monday-Friday) for up to 5 weeks. These&#xD;
      visits should last about 45-60 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Visits:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following tests and procedures will be performed 1 time every week for up to 5 weeks&#xD;
      while you are on study:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a physical and skin exam.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have lung function tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will also have a chest x-ray and a four-dimensional (4D) CT scan to check the status of&#xD;
      the disease during the last week that you are receiving IMRT. A 4D CT scan is performed just&#xD;
      like a CT scan, but during the 4D CT scan, a small black box (about the size of a deck of&#xD;
      cards) will be placed on your abdomen. This box will allow more views of the tumor to be seen&#xD;
      during the scan by the study staff.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Length of Study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      You may receive IMRT for up to 5 weeks. The IMRT will be stopped early if the disease gets&#xD;
      worse or intolerable side effects occur.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up Visits:&#xD;
&#xD;
      One (1) month after your last dose of IMRT, you will have a chest x-ray, lung function tests,&#xD;
      4D CT scan and a physical exam. The chest x-ray and CT scan will be performed to check the&#xD;
      status of the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two (2) months after your last dose of IMRT, you will have a chest x-ray and a physical exam.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Three (3) months after your last dose of IMRT, you will have a chest x-ray, lung function&#xD;
      tests, a physical exam, a 4D CT scan and a regular CT scan of your chest. The chest x-ray and&#xD;
      CT scans will be performed to check the status of the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Long-term Follow-up:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Every 3 months for 2 years, every 6 months for the next 3 years, and 1 time every year after&#xD;
      that, you will have lung function tests, a physical exam, and alternating CT and positron&#xD;
      emission tomography (PET) scans to check the status of the disease. This means that if you&#xD;
      have a CT scan at one visit, you will have a PET scan at the next visit, or vice versa.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an investigational study. IMRT given directly to the pleura in patients with MM after&#xD;
      a pleurectomy is currently being used for research purposes only.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 22 patients will take part in this study. All will be enrolled at MD Anderson.&#xD;

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Patients must have undergone radical pleurectomy/decortication and will be enrolled&#xD;
             after surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Patients must have had a CT/PET scan prior to surgery&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Patients will have baseline pulmonary function tests and a quantitative V/Q scan prior&#xD;
             to radiation therapy, and then pulmonary function tests one month and three months&#xD;
             after the completion of radiation. To be conservative, we will assume that the&#xD;
             ipsilateral lung will be nonfunctional after radiation treatment. Therefore, our&#xD;
             inclusion criteria for baseline pulmonary function tests are very similar to those&#xD;
             that we require prior to an extrapleural pneumonectomy, and are as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. FEV1 &gt;/= 30% of predicted postoperative (ppoFEV1) (as if the patient underwent a&#xD;
             pneumonectomy) based on the following formula using the quantitative V/Q scan: -&#xD;
             Predicted post-resection FEV1 = FEV1 x % perfusion to uninvolved lung from the&#xD;
             quantitative V/Q scan report.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. DLCO &gt; 35% predicted&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Patients must be able to lie flat for the duration of the treatment planning sessions&#xD;
             and treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Patients must be adequately recovered from surgery and prepared to begin radiation&#xD;
             therapy 18 weeks after pleurectomy/decortication. We anticipate that most patients&#xD;
             will be ready for radiation simulation between 8-16 weeks after surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Patients who have received induction chemotherapy will be included in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. **Note that 2- 6 represent standard criteria for the delivery of radiation therapy&#xD;
             after pleurectomy/decortication, and are not novel criteria for the purposes of this&#xD;
             protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Age &gt;/= 18.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. All women of childbearing potential (A woman of child-bearing potential is a sexually&#xD;
             mature woman who has not undergone a hysterectomy or who has not been naturally&#xD;
             postmenopausal for at least 12 consecutive months [i.e., who has had menses at any&#xD;
             time in the preceding 12 consecutive months]) and male participants must practice&#xD;
             effective contraception (abstinence, oral, injectable, or implantable hormonal&#xD;
             contraceptive; tubal ligation; intra-uterine device; barrier contraceptive with&#xD;
             spermicide; or vasectomized partner) throughout the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Calculated glomerular filtration rate of 80 mL/min/1.73m^2 with at least 40% of renal&#xD;
             contribution from the kidney contralateral to the treated hemithorax, as demonstrated&#xD;
             by a pre-radiation renal scan.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Patients having previous radiation therapy to the low neck, thorax or upper abdomen,&#xD;
             unless the previous radiation therapy is clearly out of the current radiation field,&#xD;
             as determined by the treating physician&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Patients with metastatic disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Patients with any of the following conditions: 1) concomitant malignancies other than&#xD;
             squamous cell or basal cell carcinoma of the skin, 2) Carcinoma in situ of the cervix,&#xD;
             3) Uncontrolled acute congestive heart failure defined by New York Heart Association&#xD;
             Class III or IV. 4) Patients that have NCCN classified low-risk prostate cancer&#xD;
