      Introduction:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Infertility affects an increasing number of couples. For many, the choice of treatment is In&#xD;
      Vitro Fertilization (IVF). Currently, there are no markers fully predictive of developmental&#xD;
      competence of human IVF embryos. Present embryo selection is based on morphology assessment,&#xD;
      which produces implantation rates in the range of 20-30 %. To maximize the probability of&#xD;
      obtaining a pregnancy, multiple embryos are often transferred simultaneously at the risk of&#xD;
      multiple gestations. The high multiple pregnancy rates associated with IVF increases the risk&#xD;
      of neonatal complications and maternal pregnancy-related health problems. Single Embryo&#xD;
      Transfer (SET) is an effective way of minimizing the risk of multiple gestations, but an&#xD;
      accurate method of selecting the most viable embryo will optimise the use of SET. Today, the&#xD;
      quality of an embryo is assessed using microscopic evaluation of morphological parameters,&#xD;
      but the method has limited predictive value. Therefore, several areas are investigated in&#xD;
      search of additional markers of viability in order to reduce multiple gestation rates and&#xD;
      improve implantation rates, but all have yet to prove their value in a clinical setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Gene expression profiling is a novel strategy with potential to identify the most viable&#xD;
      embryo. Several publications suggest that differences in gene expression patterns are related&#xD;
      to embryo potential and quality. A bovine study identified specific genes related to&#xD;
      viability using microarray technology, proposing their use as markers of viability. A similar&#xD;
      study has been performed on human embryos, identifying 7000 transcripts associated to&#xD;
      successful IVF treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Time-lapse analysis is another way of assessing embryo potential. Studying cleavage kinetics,&#xD;
      where milestones of early development, such as fertilization, cleavage, synchrony and&#xD;
      duration of cleavage, are correlated to differences in time intervals, might very well be a&#xD;
      useful marker of embryo viability. Recently, an EmbryoScope (Unisense Fertitech,&#xD;
      http://www.unisense.com/Default.aspx?ID=170) has been developed that allows series of photos&#xD;
      taking during incubation (Time-lapse). The pictures are taken every 30 minutes within a&#xD;
      controlled incubator housed with camera and microscope&#xD;
&#xD;
      Embryo metabolism is considered a critical determinant of viability, and it is likely that&#xD;
      viable embryos possess a unique metabolic profile, expressed by composition of metabolites in&#xD;
      the culture medium. Metabolomics studies the inventory of metabolites representing the&#xD;
      functional genotype. Near-Infrared (NIR) spectroscopy is an analytic technique based on&#xD;
      spectroscopy in the near infrared region suitable for rapid analysis of the metabolome.&#xD;
      Recent publications suggest that the metabolic profile can be used to identify high potential&#xD;
      embryos using NIR .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim and hypothesis. The purpose of the present study is to examine pregnancy&#xD;
      outcome/potential to implant and its relationship to 1) transcriptional profile of selected&#xD;
      genes,, 2) cleavage kinetics, and 3) metabolic profile. In particular we hypothesize that the&#xD;
      transcription of selected genes, the cleavage kinetics and the metabolic profile from embryos&#xD;
      with high developmental competence and implantation potential will differ from embryos of&#xD;
      lower quality and therefore that these parameters will be predictive of pregnancy success.&#xD;
      Furthermore, the interrelationship - if any - between these parameters will be evaluated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A secondary aim is to evaluate the effect of blastomere biopsy using time-lapse and metabolic&#xD;
      analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
      Perspective: Should the analysis of selected genes, Time-Lapse or metabolic profiles prove&#xD;
      predictive of viability, the methods could be used supplementary when assessing embryo&#xD;
      viability, refining the existing criteria. Apart from generating new knowledge concerning the&#xD;
      biology of the preimplantation embryo, the study aims to improve existing IVF techniques.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Bioinformatical and comparative examination of homology and transcription in bovine and&#xD;
           human genes; identification of human candidate genes Purpose: To identify human&#xD;
           analogues to the 52 bovine candidate genes by comparing nucleotide sequences and gene&#xD;
           transcription between humans and cattle, using databases and bioinformational tools.&#xD;
           Based on the results and existing publications and knowledge concerning gene expression&#xD;
           and embryogenesis in humans and cattle 12 genes will be selected for further analysis.&#xD;
           After designing primers for RT-PCR, ultra sensitive, quantitative (q)-rt-PCR analyses&#xD;
           are developed. Before testing humane embryos, the analyses will be performed on human&#xD;
           cell-lines.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Materials and methods: In brief, cells are lysed and mRNA isolated, using an mRNA&#xD;
           extraction kit. cDNA is generated using reverse transcriptase PCR with sequence specific&#xD;
           primers. Quantitative analyses of embryo cDNA are performed with Real Time PCR on Roche&#xD;
           Light-cycler using fluorescence DNA labelling. Results are reported as relative&#xD;
           expressions to an endogenous control.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Quantification and variation of putative pregnancy-related genes in biopsies from human&#xD;
           blastocysts Purpose: Quantification of max. 12 selected genes on biopsies from humane&#xD;
           IVF blastocysts using RT-PCR and Real-Time PCR. The results will be used to select 5&#xD;
           genes for further analysis. The main purpose is to characterize and describe variations&#xD;
           in transcription of the selected genes in human preimplantation embryos.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Materials and methods Couples undergoing IVF treatment in order to permit preimplantation&#xD;
      genetic diagnosis (PGD) of the embryo will be requested permission to include embryos with&#xD;
      diagnosed gene or chromosomal disorders in the project, embryos which under normal&#xD;
      circumstances are discarded. The diagnosis healthy/diseased is made by PCR og FISH analysis&#xD;
      of a blastomere biopsied on day 3 (8-cell stage). The embryos are routinely cultured in the&#xD;
      EmbryoScope until day 5 after oocyte retrieval.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Embryo biopsy Embryos included in the project are cultured until day 5 after oocyte&#xD;
      retrieval. On day 3 the embryos are biopsied using a laser. The biopsies are marked and&#xD;
      frozen for later analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Gene expression analysis The gene expression in cells from the biopsies are analysed using&#xD;
      RT-PCR and real-time PCR as described (project 1) with the purpose of quantifying 2-5 genes&#xD;
      from each individual cell, quantifying at maximum 12 genes. Each gene is analysed in biopsies&#xD;
      from 10 different embryos, to characterize inter-individual differences. From each blastocyst&#xD;
      are taken at least two biopsies, which are subjected to identical RT-PCR and rt-PCR analyses&#xD;
      to evaluate potential intra-individual differences and to validate the method.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Time-lapse analysis: Embryos are cultured in the EmbryScope, images are recorded every 20&#xD;
      min.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3A, B and C: Implantation in relation to transcription of selected genes, Time-Lapse&#xD;
      parameters, and metabolic profile Purpose: To correlate result of the IVF treatment (+/-&#xD;
      clinical pregnancy) to A: the expression of 5 selected genes B: cleavage kinetics using&#xD;
      Time-Lapse analysis C: metabolic profile using Near-Infrared (NIR) Spectroscopy&#xD;
&#xD;
      Culturing of embryos In Denmark, IVF embryos are currently normally transferred 2-3 days&#xD;
      after oocyte retrieval.. Improvements of media techniques used for culturing have led to a&#xD;
      trend towards blastocyst transfer in many clinics. During the first week of preimplantation&#xD;
      development, gene transcription switch from maternal to embryonic control, and the energy&#xD;
      metabolism changes. Furthermore, the proportion of euploid embryos is higher when comparing&#xD;
      blastocysts with cleavage stage embryos. On the other hand, some embryos arrest their&#xD;
      development, leaving fewer embryos available for transfer. The latest Cochrane (2007)&#xD;
      analysis concludes that there is growing evidence in favour of blastocyst transfer for SET,&#xD;
      in particular when treating women with many retrieved oocytes. Genetic material from the&#xD;
      embryo can be obtained by performing biopsies on either the cleavage-stage embryo (8 cells),&#xD;
      where one or two blastomeres are removed, or from the blastocyst (about 100 cells), taking&#xD;
      2-10 cells from the trophectoderm (TE). Advantages of TE biopsy include obtaining more&#xD;
      genomic material (DNA/RNA), which improves the diagnostic reliability. The embryo is exposed&#xD;
      to less stressful conditions, since a relatively smaller proportion of cells is removed, plus&#xD;
      the biopsy is performed from extra-embryonic tissue, that is, cells forming the placenta.&#xD;
      Blastocyst biopsy does not appear to impair developmental competence and implantation&#xD;
      (13,17-19). In conclusion, performing TE biopsy on blastocysts seems to be less invasive and&#xD;
      stressful while yielding more information, thus making it our choice of method.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Biopsy On day 3 after oocyte retrieval, a small hole in zona pellucida is made with a laser,&#xD;
      allowing the TE to herniate through the hole during the next 2 days incubation. Early on day&#xD;
      5 embryos are assessed for blastocyst development according to the criteria listed below, and&#xD;
      one embryo is chosen for transfer. TE biopsy is performed on this embryo by aspirating the&#xD;
      herniating TE, approximately 2-20 cells, into an embryo biopsy pipette and cutting it off&#xD;
      with laser. The cells are immediately frozen for later analysis. The spent embryo medias are&#xD;
      collected individually and frozen at - 80 C for later NIR analysis. Models of spectral&#xD;
      regions are used to calculate an individual viability index for each embryo. Urine hCG test&#xD;
      and ultrasound at gestational ages 8 and 12 are used to determine pregnancy outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blastocyst score: Embryos are evaluated on day 5 using criteria described by Gardner et al,&#xD;
      where blastocyst are scored according to size. Briefly, the blastocysts were graded according&#xD;
      to size: [1] early blastocyst, the blastocoel is less than half the volume of the embryo; [2]&#xD;
      blastocyst, the blastocoel is greater than or equal to half of the volume of the embryo; [3]&#xD;
      full blastocyst, the blastocoel completely fills the embryo; [4] expanded blastocyst, the&#xD;
      blastocoel volume is larger than that of the early embryo and the zona is thinning; [5]&#xD;
      hatching blastocyst, the trophectoderm has started to herniate through the zona; and [6]&#xD;
      hatched blastocyst, the blastocyst has completely escaped from the zona. For blastocysts&#xD;
      graded as 3 to 6 (i.e., full blastocysts and onward) the development of the inner cell mass&#xD;
      (ICM) and trophectoderm can be assessed. The ICM grading is as follows: A. tightly packed,&#xD;
      many cells; B. loosely grouped, several cells; C. very few cells. The trophectoderm grading&#xD;
      is as follows: A. many cells forming a tightly knit epithelium; B. few cells; C. very few&#xD;
      cells forming a loose epithelium.&#xD;
