  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cetuximab, erlotinib, and panitumumab are all recently FDA approved epidermal growth factor&#xD;
      receptor (EGFR) inhibitors that treat a wide variety of tumor types, such as colon, lung, and&#xD;
      head and neck. Blockade of the EGFR results in inhibition of multiple downstream pathways,&#xD;
      leading to slowed tumor growth. In addition, these inhibitors may enhance anti-tumor immune&#xD;
      responses through uncharacterized mechanisms. While producing significant responses in many&#xD;
      settings, EGFR inhibitors also result in significant skin toxicity (rash) in a high&#xD;
      percentage of patients. Multiple studies have correlated the presence and severity of rash&#xD;
      with clinical response. Unfortunately, severe rash can often lead to dose delays, reductions,&#xD;
      or even discontinuation of EGFR inhibitors, thus limiting their efficacy. The mechanism of&#xD;
      both the rash and its correlation with tumor response is poorly understood. Skin biopsies&#xD;
      display a robust leukocyte infiltrate, but a systematic analysis of the type of infiltrating&#xD;
      leukocytes, activation state, or homing receptor expression has not been performed.&#xD;
      Chemokines and chemokine receptors control leukocyte trafficking to the skin and other tissue&#xD;
      sites, and defined receptor profiles for skin-, gut-, and lung-homing leukocytes are well&#xD;
      established. In this study, the investigators propose to evaluate the homing phenotype of&#xD;
      leukocytes from peripheral blood and skin biopsies of patients receiving EGFR inhibitors. The&#xD;
      investigators will use RNA microarrays to evaluate the expression of chemokines and other key&#xD;
      genes regulated in skin during treatment. The investigators will utilize in vitro methods to&#xD;
      investigate effects of EGFR inhibitors on imprinting of T cell tissue-specific homing&#xD;
      receptors. The investigators will examine correlations among the pathologic data, clinical&#xD;
      findings, and tumor response. If validated, peripheral blood evaluation could potentially be&#xD;
      used as a predictive indicator for patients receiving EGFR inhibitors. This study may also&#xD;
      identify novel targets for limiting skin toxicity while receiving EGFR inhibitors, thus&#xD;
      allowing maximal dosing and clinical response from these agents.&#xD;
