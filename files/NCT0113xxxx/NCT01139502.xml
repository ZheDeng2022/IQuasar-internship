      This study will compare the effects of cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT) and cognitive&#xD;
      training in work rehabilitation of patients with severe mental illness (psychoses).&#xD;
&#xD;
      These interventions will be compared with a matched control group ('treatment as usual'). The&#xD;
      patients will be recruited in nine different counties in Norway. During a two-year period&#xD;
      around 27-30 patients can be recruited from each county, meaning that each intervention arm&#xD;
      will contain approximately 80 patients. The evaluation of the patients will include several&#xD;
      validated diagnostic instruments as described below. The counties has been randomised to the&#xD;
      two different intervention groups by a neutral institution: 1.group receiving work&#xD;
      rehabilitation based on cognitive behaviour therapy, and 2.group receiving cognitive&#xD;
      training. The control group will be matched according to gender and age. With Ntotal=160 for&#xD;
      the comparison of two groups (80 patients x 2), a 0.05 level of significance and a power of&#xD;
      0.80, a standardised group difference of 0.44 can be detected. The standardised difference&#xD;
      detected between supported employment and treatment as usual has been as high as 0.80 in&#xD;
      comparable American studies, indicating that N is large enough in the present study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participants in each county will be evaluated and followed by a local project coordinator&#xD;
      and by a local psychiatrist/psychologist in a District Psychiatric Centre. Written evaluation&#xD;
      protocols will be sent anonymously to the research centre for registration. Data will be&#xD;
      stored according to current laws of person protection and data security. Pre-post differences&#xD;
      in each group, differences between the control group and the intervention groups, and&#xD;
      differences between the intervention groups will be tested using a mixed linear model&#xD;
      programme.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research questions The project will compare the effects of CBT oriented work rehabilitation&#xD;
      and work rehabilitation with cognitive training with regard to the ability of persons with&#xD;
      severe mental disorders to cope with and keep a job. The two intervention arms will be&#xD;
      compared with each other and with a matched treatment as usual control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main hypotheses&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. By the end of the project (T2) and by follow up examination (T3) the global psychosocial&#xD;
           function of patients will be higher in the CBT work rehabilitation group than in the&#xD;
           control group&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The global psychosocial function of patients at T2 and T3 will be higher in the&#xD;
           cognitive training group than in the control group&#xD;

      Cognitive behaviour therapy and cognitive training in work rehabilitation for persons with&#xD;
      severe mental illness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A randomised controlled trial&#xD;
&#xD;
      Introduction This study will compare the effects of cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT) and&#xD;
      cognitive training in work rehabilitation of patients with severe mental illness (psychoses).&#xD;
&#xD;
      These interventions will be compared with a matched control group ('treatment as usual'). The&#xD;
      patients will be recruited in nine different counties in Norway. During a two-year period&#xD;
      around 27-30 patients can be recruited from each county, meaning that each intervention arm&#xD;
      will contain approximately 80 patients. The evaluation of the patients will include several&#xD;
      validated diagnostic instruments as described in the detailed description below. The counties&#xD;
      will be randomised to the two different intervention groups: 1. a group receiving CBT&#xD;
      inspired work rehabilitation, and 2. a group receiving work rehabilitation integrated with&#xD;
      cognitive training. The control group will be matched according to gender and age. With&#xD;
      Ntotal=160 for the comparison of two groups (80 patients x 2), a 0.05 level of significance&#xD;
      and a power of 0.80, a standardised group difference of 0.44 can be detected. The&#xD;
      standardised difference detected between supported employment and treatment as usual has been&#xD;
      as high as 0.80 in comparable American studies, indicating that N is large enough in the&#xD;
      present study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participants in each county will be evaluated and followed by a local project coordinator&#xD;
      in a District Psychiatric Centre (DPS), and by a local psychiatrist/psychologist. Written&#xD;
      evaluation protocols will be sent anonymously to the research centre for registration. Data&#xD;
      will be stored according to current laws of person protection and data security. Pre-post&#xD;
      differences in each group, differences between the control group and the intervention groups,&#xD;
      and differences between the intervention groups will be tested using a mixed linear model&#xD;
      programme.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background Vulnerability and stress in schizophrenia Schizophrenia is a mental disorder&#xD;
      characterised by psychotic symptoms, apathy, social isolation and cognitive problems, which&#xD;
      often reduce the functional capacity in central life arenas. Patients have problems in school&#xD;
      and at work, with being a parent or friend, and in severe cases with being able to live on&#xD;
      their own and cope with the challenges of daily life (Mueser &amp; McGurk 2004). Schizophrenia is&#xD;
      one of the ten most important causes of severe chronic disability (Velligan &amp; Gonzales 2007).&#xD;
      The course of the disease is perhaps best described and understood by the so-called&#xD;
      stress/diathesis model. According to this model the person has a psychobiological&#xD;
      vulnerability basically determined by genetic and perinatal environmental factors. The debut&#xD;
      and course of the disease is determined by a dynamic interplay between biological and&#xD;
      psychosocial factors. Medication and use of legal and illegal drugs are the most important&#xD;
      biological factors. Antipsychotic medication can reduce symptom intensity and the probability&#xD;
      of relapse, whereas drug abuse often has the opposite effects. The most important&#xD;
      psychosocial factors are perceived stress, social support, and the patient's coping profile.&#xD;
      High levels of stress can increase the biological vulnerability, symptom intensity, and&#xD;
      relapse probability, whereas social support and the development of social abilities and&#xD;
      problem solving skills tend to protect the individual.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cognitive behaviour therapy Cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT) in schizophrenia was originally&#xD;
      developed to help the patient cope with delusions and hallucinations that did not respond to&#xD;
      medical treatment. CBT assumes that delusions and hallucinations are influenced by the&#xD;
      person's problems sorting and interpreting information, and that cognitive interventions can&#xD;
      increase coping(Velligan &amp; Gonzales 2007). Therapist and patient examine the contents of the&#xD;
      symptoms in detail, and explore whether the symptoms can be understood in new and more&#xD;
      functional ways. Controlled studies clearly support the efficacy of CBT in schizophrenia&#xD;
      (Tarrier &amp; Wykes 2004, Turkington et al 2004).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The explanatory model of CBT, including core concepts as schema, automatic thoughts, socratic&#xD;
      questioning, and alternative thoughts, now colour most of the rehabilitation programmes in&#xD;
      schizophrenia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cognitive training It was previously assumed that the reason why persons with psychotic&#xD;
      diseases have problems in daily life is their reduced sense of reality, delusions and&#xD;
      hallucinations. Today there is consensus that the problem is far more complex. Research shows&#xD;
      that neurocognitive dysfunction is prevalent in persons with schizophrenia, and that this&#xD;
      rather stable dysfunction is an important prognostic factor (Velligan et al 1997). The&#xD;
      patients have problems with memory, attention, problem solving capacity, and reduced&#xD;
      psychomotor speed. It has been demonstrated that neurocognitive dysfunction impacts more&#xD;
      strongly on activities of daily life than do positive symptoms of psychosis, and that it&#xD;
      predicts coping about as strongly as negative symptoms (Green et al 2000). Neurocognitive&#xD;
      dysfunction impairs the person's ability to learn new skills, social relations, academic&#xD;
      capacity and work capacity. It is particularly manifested as attention and concentration&#xD;
      problems, when complex work tasks must be solved under time pressure. Consequently, many of&#xD;
      these patients have problems handling jobs and academic courses that demand speed and mental&#xD;
      flexibility. They have serious problems qualifying for a job, and if employed they tend to&#xD;
      loose their job more often than other workers, with adverse social, economic and mental&#xD;
      consequences. These patients also strive to cope with rehabilitation projects involving many&#xD;
      people (Bell &amp; Bryson 2001). Today several researchers maintain that neurocognitive&#xD;
      dysfunction is the key problem in schizophrenia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These findings have produced new rehabilitation programmes aiming at developing or restoring&#xD;
      neurocognitive function (McGurk et al 2007). Cognitive rehabilitation focuses on improving&#xD;
      function through a) reinforcement or reestablishment of previously learned behaviour, b)&#xD;
      establishment of new cognitive abilities or compensatory mechanisms for impaired neurological&#xD;
      systems (Harley et al 1992). These methods have for many years been used successively in&#xD;
      treatment of patients with brain damages. Great progress has been made in this field during&#xD;
      the last two decades, and training programmes are now also available for persons with mental&#xD;
      disorders. The effects of cognitive rehabilitation have been examined in controlled studies&#xD;
      showing that neurocognitive function can be improved by structured training (Ueland &amp; Rund&#xD;
      2005), and as a consequence psychosocial adaptation may be improved.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Work rehabilitation in schizophrenia The National Norwegian Development Plan for Mental&#xD;
      Health (Opptrappingsplanen for psykisk helse) states that work and meaningful activities are&#xD;
      important sources of social identity and self esteem.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Work rehabilitation for patients with schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders&#xD;
      traditionally has been a great challenge both in Norway and other countries. Even though&#xD;
      about half of the patients want a job, only a minority of these are employed (McGurk &amp; Mueser&#xD;
      2004). Chronic social dysfunction makes it difficult to compete effectively on the ordinary&#xD;
      job market. Optimal treatment of symptoms combined with cognitive training that increase&#xD;
      competence may somewhat improve their chances, but recent studies indicate that for many&#xD;
      patients adjustments of job demands are necessary in addition to continuing support to cope&#xD;
      with the job (Drake et al 1999). More than 50% of the participants cope in supported&#xD;
      employment programmes in the US, compared to only 20% in control groups. Programmes combining&#xD;
      cognitive training with supported employment seem to be particularly promising (Wexler &amp; Bell&#xD;
      2005, McGurk &amp; Mueser 2004). These programmes reduce stress through personal support and&#xD;
      tailoring of job demands, and increase competence through cognitive training.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prejudice and lack of openness and understanding are still prevalent at the work place, and&#xD;
      tend to prevent successful work rehabilitation of patients with psychotic disorders. Like&#xD;
      family members leaders and colleagues may easily perceive symptoms as incomprehensible and&#xD;
      frightening or as expressions of laziness or hostility, and react negatively and correcting,&#xD;
      with the same adverse consequences. In a pilot project we investigated whether the&#xD;
      psycho-educative method could be adapted and used in work rehabilitation of patients with&#xD;
      severe mental disorder. The goal of this project was to examine whether the psycho-educative&#xD;
      method used in work rehabilitation can increase the chances that persons with severe mental&#xD;
      disorders will cope with a job, and, secondly, to develop good models of collaboration&#xD;
      between the welfare institutions to improve work rehabilitation for persons with severe&#xD;
      mental disorders. Two external evaluations of the pilot project concluded that both the&#xD;
      psycho-educative method and the other cognitive methods can be adapted to the work&#xD;
      rehabilitation context, and that the organised collaboration between clinicians and job&#xD;
      consultants has a great potential. The participants were generally very stable and evaluated&#xD;
      the experience positively. The engagement in the pilot project grew over time both in the&#xD;
      work and welfare system and in the psychiatric health care system (DPS), and so it was&#xD;
      decided to spread the project to nine different counties.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research questions&#xD;
&#xD;
      The present project will compare the effects of cognitive behaviour therapy and cognitive&#xD;
      training with regard to the ability of persons with severe mental disorders to cope with and&#xD;
      keep a job. The two intervention arms will be compared with each other and with a matched&#xD;
      treatment as usual control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypotheses&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. By the end of the project (T2) and by follow up examination (T3) the global psychosocial&#xD;
           function of patients will be higher in the CBT work rehabilitation group than in the&#xD;
           control group&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The global psychosocial function of patients at T2 and T3 will be higher in the&#xD;
           cognitive training group than in the control group&#xD;
&#xD;
      Material and Method&#xD;
&#xD;
      Material Persons with DSM-IV schizophrenia spectrum disorders about to start work&#xD;
      rehabilitation will be recruited in nine different counties in Norway. From each county&#xD;
      around 27-30 patients can be recruited during a two-year period, giving a total of a little&#xD;
      less than 250 patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Method&#xD;
&#xD;
      Instruments&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following instruments will be used:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Diagnosis: The MINI interview (Sheehan et al 1997). Intensity of positive and negative&#xD;
      symptoms: The Health of the Nation Scale (HoNOS, Wing et al 1996), The Apathy Evaluation&#xD;
      Scale (self rating version) (Marin et al 1991), and the PANSS (Key et al 1987).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Global functioning: The Global Assessment of Functioning Scale (GAF) (APA 1987). Complicating&#xD;
      drug abuse: The Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT) (Saunders et al 1993) and&#xD;
      Drug Use Disorders Identification Test (DUDIT) (Bermann et al 2005).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cognitive functioning: The Measurement and Treatment Research to Improve Cognition in&#xD;
      Schizophrenia (MATRIX)-battery (Marder et al 2004).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Relations to leaders and colleagues: The Felt Expressed Emotion Rating Scale (FEERS, Bentsen&#xD;
      1999).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Work performance: The Work Behavior Inventory (Bell et al 2004)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention CBT in work rehabilitation: The contents of the psychoeducative classes in the&#xD;
      pilot study has been adjusted and standardised. Classes will be offered to all employees in&#xD;
      the participating companies. Central themes are symptoms, course, methods of treatment,&#xD;
      rehabilitation, relapse prevention and prognosis in schizophrenia and other psychoses. The&#xD;
      core elements and the basic ways of reasoning in CBT (schema, automatic and alternative&#xD;
      thoughts) will be particularly emphasised. The DPS supervisor in each county will meet the&#xD;
      job consultants weekly through the whole project period and be easily available for&#xD;
      consultations on telephone. The central supervision focus will be current communicative and&#xD;
      behavioural problems at the work site. Attempts to solve such problems will continuously&#xD;
      include the participants. Each participant will be offered 10 months in the project.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cognitive training: The cognitive training will be computer based and use a programme package&#xD;
      developed by dr. psychol. Torill Ueland. The programmes include training of attention,&#xD;
      memory, executive functioning, and psychomotor speed. Computer based training allows for&#xD;
      multi-sensoric feedback and positive reinforcement. Moreover, computer based training can be&#xD;
      used individually in that the degree of difficulty can be varied . This is important since&#xD;
      neurocognitive profile and functioning vary among patients. Group training is economically&#xD;
      attractive since one person can administrate the programme to six persons simultaneously. The&#xD;
      programme package has been adapted to the Norwegian context, but the selection of tasks is&#xD;
      based on international research. It combines tasks originally developed for patients with&#xD;
      brain injuries (Cog Rehab) and tasks developed for psychiatric patients (Cogpack). Tasks from&#xD;
      both sources have been used in several previous studies (Bell et al 2001, McGurk et al 2005).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design Six counties have been randomised to one (n=80) of the two intervention groups. A&#xD;
      matched control group (treatment as usual, n=80) will be established in three other counties.&#xD;
      With a total N=160 for comparison of two groups, a significance level of 0.05 and a power&#xD;
      level of 0.80, a standardised group difference of 0.44 can be detected. The standardised&#xD;
      difference between supported employment and treatment as usual in comparable American studies&#xD;
      have been as high as 0.80 (Velligan &amp; Gonzales 2007), meaning that N should be acceptable in&#xD;
      the present project.&#xD;
