  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Section 136 of the Mental Health Act (MHA) 1983 allows the police to detain someone in a&#xD;
      public place if there are reasons to believe that they may be suffering from a mental&#xD;
      disorder and to be in need of care or control. For a significant number of psychiatric&#xD;
      patients, detention under section 136 and accessing psychiatric services via the police&#xD;
      remains an important, and sometimes the only pathway to care. Approximately 17400 people were&#xD;
      detained under section 136 of the MHA 1983 during the year 2005-2006 (Independent Police&#xD;
      Complaints Commission, 2008).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite the large number of patients accessing mental health services via the police, there&#xD;
      is no research available to identify the service users' perspective of what led them to come&#xD;
      into contact with police and to identify the reasons for care not being accessed by&#xD;
      conventional routes. Royal College Psychiatrists (RCP, 2008) and Independent Police&#xD;
      Complaints Commission (IPCC, 2008) found that there was lack of research into the service&#xD;
      users' perspective and recommended research into this area.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators have devised this research project to help themselves and the wider&#xD;
      research and clinical community understand the service users' perspective of how they came to&#xD;
      be detained by the police, whether the community services had failed and explore their views&#xD;
      to understand what can be done to improve the service provisions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fieldhead hospital, Wakefield provides acute inpatient care for psychiatric patients. Those&#xD;
      who are detained under section 136 of the MHA in Wakefield area are taken to a place of&#xD;
      safety and following assessment they may be admitted formally or informally to Fieldhead&#xD;
      hospital for assessment and treatment. Those who are detained under section 136 of MHA and&#xD;
      subsequently admitted as inpatients to Fieldhead hospital will be included in this study.&#xD;
