    <time_frame>up to 2 years</time_frame>
    <description>Complete Cytogenetic Response (CCyR) is defined as 0% of Ph+ metaphases. A patient was counted as CCyR at 12 cycles if the patient met the CCyR criteria at the Cycle 12 Visit.&#xD;
Major molecular response is defined as values equal or below 0.1% on the International Scale.&#xD;
Complete Molecular Response is defined as a Bcr-Abl (a fusion of gene of Bcr and ABl genes) ratio ≤0.0032% on the International Scale Bcr = breakpoint cluster gene Abl = abelson proto-oncogene.</description>

    <time_frame>up to 2 years</time_frame>
    <description>Event-free survival was defined as the time from the date of randomization to the date of first occurrence of any of the following events on study treatment: loss of complete hematological response, confirmed loss of complete cytogenetic response (CCyR), confirmed loss of major molecular response (MMR), death from any cause during treatment, progression to the accelerated phase or blast crisis of chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) per European Leukemia Network (ELN) criteria, whichever was earliest.&#xD;
Progressions free survival is defined as time between Day 1 cycle 1 and time to first documented disease progression or death. Disease progression will be determined as per response criteria.&#xD;
Overall survival time is defined as the time from the treatment start to the date of death due to any reason.</description>

    <description>An AE is defined as any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product. An SAE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence that, at any dose, results in death, is life threatening, requires hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, results in disability/incapacity, is a congenital anomaly/birth defect, or is an event of possible drug-induced liver injury.</description>

        <description>Complete Cytogenetic Response (CCyR) is defined as 0% of Ph+ metaphases. A patient was counted as CCyR at 12 cycles if the patient met the CCyR criteria at the Cycle 12 Visit.&#xD;
Major molecular response is defined as values equal or below 0.1% on the International Scale.&#xD;
Complete Molecular Response is defined as a Bcr-Abl (a fusion of gene of Bcr and ABl genes) ratio ≤0.0032% on the International Scale Bcr = breakpoint cluster gene Abl = abelson proto-oncogene.</description>
