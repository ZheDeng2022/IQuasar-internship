    <textblock>
      This phase I clinical trial is studying the side effects and best dose of giving&#xD;
      gamma-secretase inhibitor RO4929097 and cediranib maleate together in treating patients with&#xD;
      advanced solid tumors. Gamma-secretase inhibitor RO4929097 and cediranib maleate may stop the&#xD;
      growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Cediranib&#xD;
      maleate also may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking blood flow to the tumor.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the tolerability, maximum tolerated dose (equivalent to the recommended phase&#xD;
      II dose), and safety profile of RO4929097 (gamma-secretase inhibitor RO4929097) in&#xD;
      combination with cediranib (cediranib maleate) in patients with advanced malignancies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To obtain pharmacokinetic (PK) profiles for RO4929097 when administered alone and for&#xD;
      RO492907 and cediranib in combination, in order to evaluate for interactive effects in PK (if&#xD;
      any) between these two agents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To evaluate pharmacodynamic (PD) effects of RO492907 when administered alone and in&#xD;
      combination, with the goal of identifying potential predictive and PD markers that need&#xD;
      further exploration and validation in future trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To assess for preliminary antitumor efficacy of this drug combination, especially in&#xD;
      breast cancer, malignant melanoma, colorectal cancer, pancreatic cancer, kidney cancer, high&#xD;
      grade glioma, non-small-cell lung cancer, and ovarian cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive gamma-secretase inhibitor RO4929097 orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-3,&#xD;
      8-10, and 15-17 (days 1-3, 8-10, 15-17 22-24, 29-31, and 36-38 of course 1) and cediranib&#xD;
      maleate PO QD on days 1-21 (days 22-42 course 1 only). Courses repeat every 21 days in the&#xD;
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 4 weeks.&#xD;
