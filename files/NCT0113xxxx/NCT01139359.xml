      This study is a Phase I trial of Darinaparsin in combination with CHOP for the treatment of&#xD;
      lymphoma. Eligible patients will not have had any previous anti-cancer treatment and will be&#xD;
      eligible to receive CHOP alone.&#xD;

             or non-Hodgkin's, T-cell or B-cell), as long as the scheduled therapy is CHOP alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
