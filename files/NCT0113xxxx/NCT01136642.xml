      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Smoking is the leading cause of preventable death in the United States, and researchers&#xD;
           are interested in gaining a better understanding of the perceived beneficial effects of&#xD;
           nicotine to help improve treatment strategies for nicotine dependence. Understanding the&#xD;
           conditions under which nicotine improves attention and cognitive processing may provide&#xD;
           more useful information for this research.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The ability to pay attention and filter relevant from irrelevant stimuli is central to&#xD;
           all aspects of information-processing. Top-down and bottom-up attentional processes&#xD;
           illustrate how the brain combines stimuli and goal-directed behaviors. Bottom-up&#xD;
           processing is an unconscious response to sensory input; for instance, when the eyes&#xD;
           automatically focus on a prominent image in a picture. Top-down processing is a&#xD;
           conscious response to drive attention toward specific stimuli; for instance, when a&#xD;
           person is asked to focus on a less immediately noticeable image in a picture.&#xD;
           Researchers are interested in determining whether nicotine improves cognitive&#xD;
           performance by acting on top-down or bottom-up attentional mechanisms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To investigate the effect of nicotine on the top-down and bottom-up mechanisms of attention&#xD;
      in cigarette smokers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Current smokers (at least 10 cigarettes per day for at least 1 year) between 18 and 55&#xD;
      years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  This study will involve one training session and four experimental sessions.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  During the training session, participants will receive a sample dose of the nicotine&#xD;
           nasal spray used in the study to determine if they can tolerate the effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  For each experimental session, participants will receive one dose of nicotine nasal&#xD;
           spray (1 mg, 2 mg, or 3 mg) or placebo spray, followed by blood pressure and heart rate&#xD;
           monitoring, performance of an attentional test, and questionnaires to rate participants&#xD;
           perception of nicotine effectiveness. Participants may receive different doses at&#xD;
           different sessions, and will not be told which dose they will receive at any given&#xD;
           point.&#xD;

      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective is to investigate the dose-response effect of nicotine on the top-down and&#xD;
      bottom-up mechanisms of attention in cigarette smokers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Male and nonpregnant-female smokers 18 to 55 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is a double-blind, placebo controlled trial of nicotine or placebo nasal sprays.&#xD;
      Participants have five visits: a training session and four experimental sessions. Each&#xD;
      participant receives a test dose of the nasal spray immediately following the training&#xD;
      session to ascertain tolerability and become familiarized with the effect of the spray. One&#xD;
      dose (0, 1.0, 2.0 or 3.0 mg) of nicotine nasal spray is administered at the beginning of each&#xD;
      experimental session followed by the test battery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome Measures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome measures are vital signs, ratings of mood and drug effect, and performance (accuracy,&#xD;
      response time) on a test of selective attention.&#xD;
