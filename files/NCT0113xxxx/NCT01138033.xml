      This study is a Phase I dose escalation study in subjects with solid tumors. Part 1 will&#xD;
      identify the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) using a dose-escalation procedure. Following&#xD;
      identification of the MTD, enrollment into Parts 2, 3, 4 and 5 may be concurrent. Part 2 will&#xD;
      explore further the safety, PK, tolerability, and anti-tumor activity of GSK2256098 in&#xD;
      subjects with tumors known to overexpress focal adhesion kinase (FAK). Part 3 will&#xD;
      characterize the range of biologically effective doses by assessing pharmacodynamic (PD)&#xD;
      markers in hair, skin and tumor tissue at doses that will not go lower than 80 mg or above&#xD;
      the MTD dose levels tested during the Phase 1 dose escalation. Part 4 will explore further&#xD;
      the safety, PK, tolerability and anti-tumor activity of GSK2256098 in subjects with relapsed&#xD;
      glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). The primary objective of this study is to determine the&#xD;
      safety, tolerability, and MTD of GSK2256098. Secondary objectives are to characterize the&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics (PK) of GSK2256098; to identify a range of biologically active doses; to&#xD;
      explore the anti-tumor activity of GSK2256098, and to explore relationships between&#xD;
      GSK2256098 PK, PD and clinical endpoints. Part 5 will investigate the time course, the extent&#xD;
      of an apparent change in the PK of GSK2256098 following repeated dosing, and screen for&#xD;
      potential CYP3A induction as a possible mechanism of reduced systemic exposure of GSK2256098&#xD;
      at Day 15 and later time points. The primary objective of this study is to determine the&#xD;
      safety, tolerability, and MTD of GSK2256098.&#xD;

      This study is a Phase I dose escalation study in subjects with solid tumors. Part 1 will&#xD;
      identify the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) using a dose-escalation procedure. Following&#xD;
      identification of the MTD, enrollment into Parts 2, 3, 4, and 5 may be concurrent. Part 2&#xD;
      will explore further the safety, PK, tolerability, and anti-tumor activity of GSK2256098 in&#xD;
      subjects with tumors known to overexpress focal adhesion kinase (FAK). Part 3 will&#xD;
      characterize the range of biologically effective doses by assessing pharmacodynamic (PD)&#xD;
      markers in hair, skin and tumor tissue at doses that will not go lower than 80 mg or above&#xD;
      the MTD dose levels tested during the Phase 1 dose escalation. Part 4 will explore further&#xD;
      the safety, PK, tolerability and anti-tumor activity of GSK2256098 in subjects with relapsed&#xD;
      glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). The primary objective of this study is to determine the&#xD;
      safety, tolerability, and MTD of GSK2256098. Secondary objectives are to characterize the&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics (PK) of GSK2256098; to identify a range of biologically active doses; to&#xD;
      explore the anti-tumor activity of GSK2256098, and to explore relationships between&#xD;
      GSK2256098 PK, PD and clinical endpoints.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects with solid tumors will receive GSK2256098 orally without interruption on consecutive&#xD;
      days. The planned starting dose in Part 1 will be a total daily dose of 160 mg administered&#xD;
      as 80 mg twice daily (BID) during the repeat dose phase of the study. In the first cohort,&#xD;
      administration of study drug will be initiated as a single dose (80 mg) on Day 1 that will be&#xD;
      followed by collection of PK samples. Subjects may then begin repeat dosing (80 mg BID) on&#xD;
      Day 2 following the collection of the 24-h PK sample. In subsequent cohorts, administration&#xD;
      of study drug will be given as a single dose (half the total daily dose) on Day 1 followed by&#xD;
      collection of PK samples. Subjects may begin repeat dosing on Day 2 following collection of&#xD;
      the 24-h PK sample.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During dose escalation (Part 1), a modified accelerated dose titration design will be&#xD;
      followed by a standard 3+3 dose escalation design until the MTD is established. After the MTD&#xD;
      is established approximately 30 additional subjects with tumors reported to have FAK&#xD;
      over-expression will be enrolled to further explore the safety, tolerability and clinical&#xD;
      activity of GSK2256098 (Part 2). Additional cohorts below the MTD may be expanded to further&#xD;
      explore and characterize the range of biologically effective doses (Part 3). Part 4 will&#xD;
      further explore the safety, PK, tolerability and anti-tumor activity of GSK2256098 in&#xD;
      subjects with relapsed glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). Part 5 will investigate the time&#xD;
      course, the extent of an apparent change in the PK of GSK2256098 following repeated dosing,&#xD;
      and screen for potential CYP3A induction as a possible mechanism of reduced systemic exposure&#xD;
      of GSK2256098 at Day 15 and later time points. The primary objective of this study is to&#xD;
      determine the safety, tolerability, and MTD of GSK2256098.&#xD;
