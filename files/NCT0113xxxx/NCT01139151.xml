  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical research study is to find the highest tolerable dose of&#xD;
      4'-thio-araC (thiarabine) that can be given to patients with advanced blood cancer. The&#xD;
      safety of this drug will also be studied and 2 different dose schedules will be tested.&#xD;

      The Study Drug:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thiarabine is designed to damage and destroy the DNA of cancer cells. This may cause the&#xD;
      cells to die.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will be assigned to 1 of 2&#xD;
      study groups based on when you joined the study. The first set of 3 participants will be&#xD;
      enrolled in Group 1, and the 2nd set of 3 participants will be enrolled in Group 2. The 3rd&#xD;
      set of 3 participants will be enrolled in Group 1, then the 4th set of 3 participants in&#xD;
      Group 2, and so on until all participants are enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group 1 will receive thiarabine for 3 days in a row in each cycle.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group 2 will receive thiarabine for 5 days a row in each cycle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cycles in this study are 3-6 weeks long, depending on how you are doing. You may begin a new&#xD;
      cycle when your blood cell counts have returned to an appropriate level. However, you may&#xD;
      begin a new study cycle earlier than that if the disease gets worse or does not improve.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The dose of thiarabine you receive will depend on when you joined this study. The first set&#xD;
      of participants will receive the lowest dose level of thiarabine. Each new set will receive a&#xD;
      higher dose of thiarabine than the set before it, if no intolerable side effects were seen.&#xD;
      This will continue until the highest tolerable dose of thiarabine is found.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Drug Administration:&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will receive thiarabine by vein over about 1 hour (+/- 15 minutes) on Days 1-3 (Group 1)&#xD;
      or Days 1-5 (Group 2) of each cycle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Visits:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood (about 2 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests 1 or 2 times a week. If the&#xD;
      disease responds well, the study doctor may decide these blood tests will occur less often.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At every study visit, you will be asked about any drugs you may be taking and symptoms you&#xD;
      may be having.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will have an ECG within 2 days before each cycle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At any time the doctor thinks it is needed, you will have a bone marrow aspiration to check&#xD;
      the status of the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Length of Participation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      You may continue taking the study drug for as long as the doctor thinks it is in your best&#xD;
      interest. You will be taken off study early if intolerable side effects occur. You may be&#xD;
      taken off study early if the disease gets worse.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-Up:&#xD;
&#xD;
      At 30 days after your last study drug dose, you will be asked about any side effects you may&#xD;
      be having. This may be done during a regular clinic visit or by phone call from the study&#xD;
      doctor or staff.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an investigational study. Thiarabine is not FDA approved or commercially available.&#xD;
      It is currently being used for research purposes only.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 70 patients will take part in this study. All will be enrolled at MD Anderson.&#xD;

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Patients must have relapsed/refractory leukemias for which no standard therapies are&#xD;
             anticipated to result in a durable remission. Patients with poor-risk myelodysplasia&#xD;
             (MDS) [i.e. refractory anemia with excess blasts (RAEB-1 or RAEB-2) by WHO&#xD;
             classification] and chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) are also candidates for&#xD;
             this protocol. Relapsed/refractory leukemias include acute non-lymphocytic leukemia&#xD;
             (AML) by WHO classification, acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL), chronic lymphocytic&#xD;
             leukemia (CLL), or chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) in blast crisis.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Patients with refractory/relapsed leukemia 16 years or older are eligible. Patients 60&#xD;
             years or older with newly diagnosed AML are eligible if they are not candidates for,&#xD;
             or if they refuse, intensive chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0-3.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Women of child-bearing potential (ie, a woman who has not been postmenopausal for at&#xD;
             least 12 consecutive months or who had not undergone previous surgical sterilization)&#xD;
             must use acceptable contraceptive methods (abstinence, intrauterine device (IUD), oral&#xD;
             contraceptive or double barrier device), and must have a negative urine pregnancy test&#xD;
             within 2 weeks prior to beginning treatment on this trial. Nursing patients are&#xD;
             excluded. Sexually active men must also use acceptable contraceptive methods for the&#xD;
             duration of time on study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Continued from #4: Pregnant and nursing patients are excluded because the effects of&#xD;
             4'-thio-araC on a fetus or nursing child are unknown.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Must be able and willing to give written informed consent&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. In the absence of rapidly progressing disease, the interval from prior treatment to&#xD;
             time of study drug administration should be at least 2 weeks for cytotoxic agents or&#xD;
             at least 5 half-lives for noncytotoxic agents. If the patient is on hydroxyurea to&#xD;
             control peripheral blood leukemic cell counts, the patient must be off hydroxyurea for&#xD;
             at least 24 hours before initiation of treatment on this protocol. Persistent&#xD;
             clinically significant toxicities from prior chemotherapy must not be greater than&#xD;
             grade 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Patients must have the following clinical laboratory values unless considered due to&#xD;
             leukemic organ involvement: 1. Serum creatinine &lt;/= 1.3 mg/dl or creatinine clearance&#xD;
             &gt; 40 ml/min. 2. Total bilirubin &lt;/= 1.5* the upper limit of normal unless considered&#xD;
             due to Gilbert's syndrome. 3. Alanine aminotransferase (ALT), or aspartate&#xD;
             aminotransferase (AST) &lt;/= 3* the upper limit of normal unless considered due to organ&#xD;
             leukemic involvement.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Patients with active central nervous system (CNS) involvement of leukemia disease are&#xD;
             included and will be treated concurrently with intrathecal therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to uncontrolled infection&#xD;
             (e.g. requiring IV antibiotics, etc), symptomatic congestive heart failure, cardiac&#xD;
             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with&#xD;
             study requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Active heart disease including myocardial infarction within previous 3 months,&#xD;
             symptomatic coronary artery disease, corrected QT interval (QTc) &gt; 480, arrhythmias&#xD;
             not controlled by medication, or uncontrolled congestive heart failure defined as&#xD;
             Class II to IV per New York Heart Association Classification.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Patients receiving any other standard or investigational treatment for their&#xD;
             hematologic malignancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Patients with known HIV positive disease; patients with active hepatitis.&#xD;
