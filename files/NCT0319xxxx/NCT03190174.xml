      This study investigates the safety/toxicity and potential anti-tumor activity of sequential&#xD;
      administration of nivolumab and escalating doses of the mTOR inhibitor ABI-009 in advanced&#xD;
      Ewing's sarcoma, PEComa, epithelioid sarcoma, desmoid tumor, chordoma, non-small cell lung&#xD;
      cancer, small cell lung cancer, urethelial carcinoma, melanoma, renal cell carcinoma,&#xD;
      squamous cell carcinoma of head and neck, hepatocellular carcinoma, classical Hodgkin's&#xD;
      lymphoma, MSI-H/dMMR metastatic colorectal cancer, and tumors with genetic mutations&#xD;
      sensitive to mTOR inhibitors&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to investigate the maximum tolerated dose of ABI-009,&#xD;
      an mTOR inhibitor, when given sequentially with nivolumab in advanced Ewing's sarcoma,&#xD;
      PEComa, epithelioid sarcoma, desmoid tumor, chordoma, non-small cell lung cancer, small cell&#xD;
      lung cancer, urethelial carcinoma, melanoma, renal cell carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma of&#xD;
      head and neck, hepatocellular carcinoma, classical Hodgkin's lymphoma, MSI-H/dMMR metastatic&#xD;
      colorectal cancer, and tumors with genetic mutations sensitive to mTOR inhibitors&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objectives are to investigate the disease control rate (DCR) and progression&#xD;
      free survival (PFS) using nivolumab/ABI-009 combination therapy in advanced Ewing's sarcoma,&#xD;
      PEComa, epithelioid sarcoma, desmoid tumor, chordoma, non-small cell lung cancer, small cell&#xD;
      lung cancer, urethelial carcinoma, melanoma, renal cell carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma of&#xD;
      head and neck, hepatocellular carcinoma, classical Hodgkin's lymphoma, MSI-H/dMMR metastatic&#xD;
      colorectal cancer, and tumors with genetic mutations sensitive to mTOR inhibitors&#xD;
&#xD;
      The exploratory objectives are (1) To correlate progression free survival (PFS) based on&#xD;
      Immune-related Response Criteria (irRECIST) with that based on RECIST v1.1, and (2) To&#xD;
      correlate PFS with PD-1 and PD-L1 expression in patients' tumors.&#xD;

    <description>This is an open label, dose-seeking phase 1b study using a defined dose of nivolumab and escalating doses of Nab-Rapamycin (ABI-009) given intravenously.&#xD;
I. Dose Escalation Phase 1 Part of Study: The study will employ the standard &quot;cohort of three&quot; design. No intra-patient dose escalation will take place.&#xD;
II. Expansion Phase 1b Part of Study: Following dose escalation, an additional 22-28 patients will receive ABI-009 at the MTD and defined doses of nivolumab to assess overall safety and potential efficacy in a greater number of patients. Patients in the expansion phase of the study may continue treatment up to 18 three-week cycles or until significant disease progression or unacceptable toxicity occurs.</description>
