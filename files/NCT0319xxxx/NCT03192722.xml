  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The effect of tinted filters and illumination on the visual performance of patients with low&#xD;
      vision (i.e., individuals with reduced vision that is uncorrectable with glasses, surgery or&#xD;
      treatments) has been a topic of research and discussion for many years, yet there is no&#xD;
      current consensus or practice standard for the evaluation and recommendation of colored&#xD;
      filters and/or illumination intensity. Anecdotally, there have been many subjective reports&#xD;
      of improvement in visual function and comfort with the use of tinted lenses. Previous studies&#xD;
      have attempted to elucidate the subjective improvements observed using vision tests, such as&#xD;
      visual acuity and contrast sensitivity, and the findings have been inconsistent.&#xD;
      Traditionally, filters and optimal illumination are prescribed clinically through a trial and&#xD;
      error method, which involves trying various filters and lamps haphazardly to determine which&#xD;
      if any are preferred by the patient. The investigators are proposing to evaluate whether the&#xD;
      illumination and filters chosen in office by participants using a new assessment tool the&#xD;
      LuxIQ/2 translate to overall patient comfort and improved speed, accuracy and print size&#xD;
      while reading, and to evaluate whether participants have the same illumination and colored&#xD;
      filter preference determined by the LuxIQ/2 in a clinical office setting and in their home&#xD;
      environment. The investigators will evaluate whether participants prefer lighting determined&#xD;
      by the new assessment tool the LuxIQ/2 in comparison to lighting determined by the OttLite&#xD;
      Cobra in office.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All eligible patients with complaints of difficulty performing sustained reading tasks, such&#xD;
      as reading books or magazines, will be evaluated for their preference for filter color and&#xD;
      lighting using the LuxIQ/2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline distance visual acuity, contrast sensitivity, and near visual acuity, will be&#xD;
      evaluated during initial presentation to the clinic as part of usual care using validated&#xD;
      tests that are routinely performed during a low vision examination. Best-corrected distance&#xD;
      visual acuity will be determined using the ETDRS (Early Treatment for Diabetic Retinopathy&#xD;
      Study) chart. Contrast sensitivity will be evaluated using the MARS contrast sensitivity&#xD;
      chart. Best-corrected near visual acuity will be evaluated using the Lighthouse Continuous&#xD;
      Text Card. The LuxIQ/2 will be administered 3 times at 15-minute intervals. Lighting&#xD;
      preferences will be evaluated 3 times using the Ott Lite Cobra. Each subject will be asked to&#xD;
      choose between their preferred lighting conditions as determined by the OttLite Cobra and the&#xD;
      LuxIQ/2, i.e each participant ill choose which lighting conditions is preferred for reading.&#xD;
      The assessment tool (OTTLite Cobra or LuxIQ/2) which is performed first will be randomized&#xD;
      for each participant. Microperimetry (a type of visual field test) will be conducted on all&#xD;
      participants using the MAIA microperimeter at the NSU site only.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For subjects who do not appreciate an improvement in reading ability with a colored filter in&#xD;
      office, we will obtain their written informed consent to include data collected during the&#xD;
      clinical examination. For participants who do not appreciate an improvement in reading&#xD;
      ability with a colored filter, but who appreciate an improvement in reading ability with&#xD;
      white light as determined by the LuxIQ/2 in comparison to the OttLite Cobra, appropriate&#xD;
      light bulb and desk lanp will be provided as determined by the LuxIQ/2. For participants who&#xD;
      prefer the lighting determined using the Ottlite Cobra, they will be provided with an Ottlite&#xD;
      Cobra desk lamp as well as their preferred settings on the device as determined through the&#xD;
      in-office evaluation to be used at home. Participants to whom light bulb recommendations were&#xD;
      provided or the Ottlite Cobra was recommended to improve lighting for their reading tasks,&#xD;
      will be contacted by a research assistant 1 week after the in office assessment to complete a&#xD;
      telephone interview which will consist of an Activity inventory questionnaire which will&#xD;
      inquire about their difficulty performing near tasks using their previous light source as&#xD;
      well as Ramulu's sustained reading test. The Ramulu sustained reading test will be performed&#xD;
      twice during the phone interview, once with their previous lighting they were using at home&#xD;
      before they obtained the new reading lamp (where they do most of their reading) and again&#xD;
      with their new desk lamp. After 1 month, the research assistant will call the participant to&#xD;
      repeat the Activity questionnaire inquiring about ability to perform near tasks using the new&#xD;
      recommended lighting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For participants who appreciate an improvement in reading ability with colored reading&#xD;
      glasses, we will obtain their written informed consent to join the longer-term study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Reading materials will be provided to participants in an enclosed envelope in office.&#xD;
           Participants will be asked to refrain from opening envelope until contacted by research&#xD;
           assistant. Other individuals who decide to participate at a later time after&#xD;
           contemplating the requirements of the research, will be sent the reading material in the&#xD;
           mail.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A research assistant will contact subject 1 week after in office assessment to complete&#xD;
           telephone interview which will consist of the reading domain of the Activity Inventory&#xD;
           questionnaire and the modified Telephone Interview of Cognitive Status (TICS-M) and&#xD;
           silent reading test. During the call, subject will be asked to read several pages of a&#xD;
           short story to themselves, silently using their current reading glasses, not the new&#xD;
           ones that will be ordered. Subjects will be asked to answer a few questions about the&#xD;
           stories. This call should take about 30-60 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Subjects will be provided with new prescription clear reading glasses. After 1 month a&#xD;
           research assistant will contact participant to repeat the same questionnaires and silent&#xD;
           reading test using a different short story.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Within a month after the phone questionnaires, the PI will make an appointment to come&#xD;
           to the subject's home to test near vision and contrast sensitivity and determine&#xD;
           preference for filter in home environment. At this time, the PI may ask for the new pair&#xD;
           of clear reading glasses to take them to our optical to tint the lenses to the color&#xD;
           that is preferred by the subject.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  One group will obtain near vision glasses with color filter/tinted lenses immediately,&#xD;
           while the other group (controls) will continue to wear the clear reading glasses for&#xD;
           another 4 weeks and will then will crossover to obtain near vision glasses with the&#xD;
           filter/tinted lenses.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  About a month after wearing near reading glasses with the colored lenses, one of our&#xD;
           research assistants will call participant to repeat the same questionnaires and silent&#xD;
           reading test again using a different short story. This call should take about 30-45&#xD;
           minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  At the end a low vision optometrist on the research team will contact participants to&#xD;
           ask some open-ended questions about what the participant thought about using the near&#xD;
           reading glasses with the colored lenses. This call should take about 15-30 minutes.&#xD;
