  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study consists of 2 parts: a retrospective study, and a prospective clinical study with&#xD;
      pembrolizumab (Keytruda®) (Phase 0).&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Retrospective study (S58910):&#xD;
&#xD;
           This is a retrospective analysis to study the expression of PD-L1 in ER/PR negative&#xD;
           breast tumors and to correlate this PD-L1 expression with tumor infiltrating lymphocytes&#xD;
           (TILs), proliferation, expression of apoptosis and clinical outcome (development of&#xD;
           distant metastases).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Phase 0 study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a Phase 0 single center, open-label, non-randomized, study in patients with early&#xD;
      breast cancer. Patients will be treated with one injection of Pembrolizumab (Keytruda®)&#xD;
      administered intravenously at 200 mg 10 +/- 4 days before surgery. This phase 0 study will&#xD;
      consist of 2 cohorts; cohort A will include patients who are scheduled for upfront surgery.&#xD;
      Cohort A1 will include patients with Her2 negative tumors, Cohort A2 patients with Her2&#xD;
      positive tumors and Cohort A3 with ER positive tumours. Cohort B will include patients who&#xD;
      received neoadjuvant chemotherapy (with anti-Her2 therapy if Her2 positive) and who have&#xD;
      clear signs of residual tumor on imaging after finishing neoadjuvant chemotherapy (i.e. on&#xD;
      imaging estimated residual tumor size of at least 10 mm). Cohort B1 will include Her2&#xD;
      negative tumors, Cohort B2 Her2 positive tumors and Cohort B3 ER positive tumors. The&#xD;
      injection will be given in the oncological outpatient unit. Patients will be monitored&#xD;
      carefully for the development of adverse experiences/events. Adverse experiences/events will&#xD;
      be evaluated according to criteria outlined in the NCI Common Terminology Criteria for&#xD;
      Adverse Events (CTCAE), version 4.0.&#xD;
