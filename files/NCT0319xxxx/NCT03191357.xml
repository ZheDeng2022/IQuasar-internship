      This protocol is designed to facilitate the recruitment, screening and registry of Military&#xD;
      Service Members (SMs) and individuals eligible for care in the Department of Defense (DoD)&#xD;
      healthcare system. This protocol will serve as an entry point for SMs, retirees and other&#xD;
      beneficiaries, to facilitate their participation in Center for Neuroscience and Regenerative&#xD;
      Medicine (CNRM)-sponsored clinical research studies at participating CNRM sites.&#xD;
      Specifically, this protocol will be comprised of an initial evaluation of participants, to&#xD;
      include questionnaires, a blood draw, and neuroimaging. This evaluation will enable&#xD;
      investigators to direct participants to CNRM-sponsored natural history, observational, or&#xD;
      interventional protocols that are most relevant to the individual interests and needs of each&#xD;
      participant. Other approved CNRM protocols may continue to recruit participants directly into&#xD;
      their respective studies, and may refer participants to this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this protocol is to develop a broad-spectrum military subject recruitment&#xD;
      database that will collect and store preliminary data on research participants who are&#xD;
      interested in and potentially eligible for current and future CNRM sponsored studies. The&#xD;
      effectiveness of the recruitment methods utilized in this protocol will be evaluated to&#xD;
      determine the most successful outreach approaches and recruitment tools for the enrollment of&#xD;
      participants, including both active and reserve component SMs along with others who are&#xD;
      eligible for care in the DoD healthcare system, who have experienced traumatic brain injury&#xD;
      (TBI), psychological health (PH) concerns, or are interested in participating in studies as&#xD;
      controls. Control participants may include (i) those with exposure to primary blast without&#xD;
      the development of TBI, (ii) those with physical injuries without experiencing head injury,&#xD;
      and (iii) healthy participants (non-injured, non-TBI, non-PH).&#xD;

      the development of TBI, (ii) those with physical injuries without experiencing head injury,&#xD;
      and (iii) healthy participants (non-injured, non-TBI, non-PH).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This protocol will serve four purposes: (i) provide a centralized resource to identify and&#xD;
      screen individuals in order to facilitate their participation in ongoing CNRM studies, (ii)&#xD;
      for participants who provide informed consent to do so, to confidentially and securely&#xD;
      collect, store, and disseminate to other CNRM investigators existing personally identifiable&#xD;
      information (PII), existing protected health information (PHI) and data collected as part of&#xD;
      research under this protocol, (iii) provide a mechanism for following and contacting subjects&#xD;
      for participation in future CNRM studies, and (iv) assess the impact of TBI and PH issues&#xD;
      upon structural and functional imaging measures to provide a more comprehensive overview of&#xD;
      participants being referred to other CNRM studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an &quot;umbrella&quot; cohort study designed to facilitate recruitment of military SMs and&#xD;
      others eligible for care in the DoD healthcare system in order to collect preliminary data&#xD;
      pertaining TBI, postconcussive syndrome (PCS), posttraumatic stress (PTS), and/or other PH&#xD;
      concerns, along with comparable data on relevant control groups. Important control&#xD;
      comparisons are a) those with exposure to primary blast without the development of TBI, b)&#xD;
      those with other types of physical injuries without head injury exposure, and c) healthy&#xD;
      controls. These control comparisons are necessary to address pertinent research questions on&#xD;
      PCS and PTS. Based on the information provided by each participant, as well as their&#xD;
      preferences expressed during their initial contact with study staff, each may either be&#xD;
      directly referred to appropriate CNRM protocols, informed that he/she is not eligible for any&#xD;
      other actively enrolling CNRM studies at this time, or proceed with full participation in&#xD;
      this enrollment protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology/Technical Approach:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Over a 5-year period, this protocol seeks to enroll up to 2000 male and female SMs as well as&#xD;
      others who are also eligible for care in the DoD healthcare system with signs and symptoms of&#xD;
      TBI, PCS, PTS or PTSD and/or other PH concerns, or relevant controls (up to 25%, or 100 per&#xD;
      year, may have exposure to primary blast without known development of TBI, physical injuries&#xD;
      without evidence of head injury, and healthy controls). Up to 400 subjects per year over the&#xD;
      next five years will be enrolled through either the standard or the abbreviated pathway and&#xD;
      will undergo study procedures at the participating sites: Fort Belvoir Community Hospital&#xD;
      (FBCH), including the Intrepid Spirit One and Brain Assessment Research Laboratory (BARL);&#xD;
      Uniformed Services University of the Health Science (USUHS), including the Clinical Research&#xD;
      Unit, (CRU) Clinical Psychophysiology and Psychopharmacology Laboratory (CPPL); and Walter&#xD;
      Reed National Military Medical Center (WRNMMC), including Defense and Veterans Brain Injury&#xD;
      Center (DVBIC) and BARL. Participants may also be enrolled in the abbreviated pathway from&#xD;
      the CNRM site at Twinbrook, although other study procedures will not occur there.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be composed of two research pathways: (i) a standard pathway and (ii) an&#xD;
      abbreviated pathway. Prior to enrollment, both pathways will pre-screen potential&#xD;
      participants to assess eligibility for the current study and for the protocol WRNMMC 353853.&#xD;
      Information on the prescreen form is collected to assist with scheduling study assessments&#xD;
      such as patient interviews and placing orders for imaging and blood collection. Participants&#xD;
      eligible for the WRNMMC 353853 will have the option to dual enroll into that study.&#xD;
      Parenthetically, it should be noted that WRNMMC 353853 recruits inpatients from the Neurology&#xD;
      and Neurosurgery Service, as well as the Neurology Clinic at WRNMMC; while the current study&#xD;
      encompasses many of the same procedures as WRNMMC 353853, the intent of the current study is&#xD;
      to recruit a much broader population, including healthy controls, those with primary&#xD;
      psychological health concerns, and those with blast exposure who do not necessarily meet&#xD;
      criteria for TBI. To facilitate accrual of our cohort, we will actively recruit from a much&#xD;
      broader range of settings, including primary care, behavioral health, and orthopedics and&#xD;
      rehabilitation clinics at WRNMMC, and a wide array of clinics and services at FBCH, in&#xD;
      addition to using CNRM's social media and other web-based efforts. Applicable study&#xD;
      procedures will depend on the pathway for enrollment, diagnostic certainty, and logistic&#xD;
      considerations such as distance from participating sites, availability of scanners, and&#xD;
      feasibility of transport.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Standard Pathway: Visit procedures for this pathway will be conducted at the participating&#xD;
      sites (FBCH, USUHS, WRNMMC) and will consist of informed consent, collection of PII/PHI,&#xD;
      generation of a Global Unique Identifier (GUID) as detailed below in section 6.3.4.,&#xD;
      structured data collection of medical history, combat-related as well as any civilian injury&#xD;
      details, symptom inventory, blood collection and validated questionnaires to assess symptoms.&#xD;
      Scale cards containing the potential responses for each of the questionnaires will be&#xD;
      provided to participants for in-person interviews. The scales correlate to specific study&#xD;
      data collection measures (questionnaires). The scale cards will allow the participant to view&#xD;
      the answer choices for each measure while the study team member administers the&#xD;
      questionnaires. The scale cards will ensure greater participant understanding during&#xD;
      administration of the questionnaires. Additionally, this pathway will include collection of&#xD;
      venous blood and a MRI of the brain for participants who consent to these elements. Visit&#xD;
      procedures will also include a physical exam, neurocognitive assessments, and exit&#xD;
      consultation. See section 6.3 Study Design for further detail.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Abbreviated Pathway: Visit procedures for this pathway will consist of informed consent,&#xD;
      collection of PII/PHI, generation of a GUID as detailed below in section 6.3.4., an&#xD;
      abbreviated questionnaire for structured collection of a medical history, injury details, and&#xD;
      validated questionnaires assessing symptoms. Scale cards containing the potential responses&#xD;
      for each of the questionnaires will be mailed to participants for telephonic interviews. The&#xD;
      scales correlate to specific study data collection measures (questionnaires). The scale cards&#xD;
      will allow the participant to view the answer choices for each measure while the study team&#xD;
      member administers the questionnaires. The scale cards will ensure greater participant&#xD;
      understanding during administration of the questionnaires. Potential research participants&#xD;
      will be enrolled in this abbreviated pathway by participating in a (i) telephonic interview&#xD;
      or (ii) an in-person interview at Twinbrook, participating sites, or at recruitment events,&#xD;
      or through some combination of these approaches. See section 6.3 Study Design for further&#xD;
      detail.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of this protocol is to facilitate recruitment of SMs and those eligible&#xD;
      for care in the DoD healthcare system to CNRM sponsored clinical research at participating&#xD;
      CNRM sites.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additional aims of the study are to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Use data collected through this protocol to improve recruitment methods&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Coordinate the enrollment of participants in CNRM studies with the greatest relevance&#xD;
           and interest to them, maintain longitudinal contact, and offer those who are interested&#xD;
           the opportunity to participate in subsequent CNRM studies after enrollment in this study&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Use data collected through the neurocognitive assessment (NIH Toolbox) to better direct&#xD;
           referral to appropriate CNRM studies&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Establish and maintain study specific recruitment databases containing (i) identifiable&#xD;
           data (PII and PHI) and (ii) coded research data&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Collect and provide blood and de-identified data to IRB-approved CNRM Biospecimen and&#xD;
           Informatics Repositories for use in future research studies (storage procedures covered&#xD;
           by USUHS IRB protocol &quot;Biorepository and Informatics Warehousing&quot;, CNRM 004)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Assessment of TBI and psychological stress impact on the brain via structural and&#xD;
           functional imaging as well as diffusion tensor imaging&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Assess imaging and neurocognitive data for patterns that could distinguish those with&#xD;
           ongoing symptoms vs. those who are more resilient after trauma&#xD;
