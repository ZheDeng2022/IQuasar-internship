  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study aims to evaluate the effect of US guided bilateral Thoracolumbar Interfascial plane&#xD;
      (TLIP) block performed at the level of the lumbar spine surgery (involving 1 up to 3 adjacent&#xD;
      lumbar vertebrae) after induction of general anesthesia and before starting the surgery on&#xD;
      postoperative opioid consumption by the patients during the first 24 hours postoperative.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Commonly performed spinal surgeries include laminectomies and discectomies, spinal fusions,&#xD;
      and instrumentations, scoliosis corrections and spinal tumor excision. Conventional&#xD;
      non-minimally invasive spinal surgeries usually involve extensive dissection of subcutaneous&#xD;
      tissues, bones, and ligaments and thus can result in a considerable degree of postoperative&#xD;
      pain. The severe pain typically last for at least 3 days with the highest pain scores&#xD;
      recorded during the first 24 hours postoperative. Pain from the back originates from&#xD;
      different tissues such as vertebrae &amp; intervertebral discs, facet joint capsules, dura &amp;&#xD;
      nerve root sleeves, ligaments, fascia, and muscles, and it is directly proportional to the&#xD;
      number of vertebrae involved in the surgery. Sensations from these structures are carried via&#xD;
      the posterior rami of spinal nerves connected to sympathetic &amp; parasympathetic nerves.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adequate pain management in this period can result in improved functional outcome, early&#xD;
      ambulation, early discharge, and preventing the development of chronic pain. Many options&#xD;
      exist for this purpose, but each has its limitations and applications. The postoperative&#xD;
      multi-modal analgesic approach to these patients include drugs like NSAIDs, acetaminophen,&#xD;
      opioids, gabapentinoids and even corticosteroids, but using drugs alone for pain management&#xD;
      in these patients can prove to be problematic due to side effects like GIT problems (NSAIDs),&#xD;
      urinary retention, respiratory depression , nausea &amp; vomiting (opioids), in addition,&#xD;
      prescribing postoperative opioids will be more complicated if the patient was on prolonged&#xD;
      preoperative opioid regimen (due to the associated opioid resistance), that's why patients on&#xD;
      opioids prior to surgery reported more time postoperatively spent in severe pain (60% versus&#xD;
      38%; p=-0.002).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Multiple loco-regional techniques were explored to help supplement the multi-modal approach&#xD;
      to decrease side effects, improve quality of postoperative analgesia, increase patient&#xD;
      satisfaction after lumbar spine surgeries and also to be used in Enhanced Recovery After&#xD;
      Surgery (ERAS) protocols which aims at minimizing opioid analgesics whenever possible.&#xD;
      Via-Catheter techniques considered include patient-controlled epidural analgesia that showed&#xD;
      promising results regarding pain control but concerns were raised due to its interference&#xD;
      with postoperative assessment of neurological functions &amp; voiding, in addition, it was&#xD;
      opposed by many surgeons due to the fact of putting a catheter very near to the surgical&#xD;
      field. Also continuous infusion of local anesthetics was explored which resulted in decreased&#xD;
      postoperative opioid consumption but also raised concerns due to the catheter being placed&#xD;
      very near to the wound.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Single injection methods that were explored in the literature include local anesthetic&#xD;
      instillation of the affected nerve roots by the surgeon before wound closure, wound local&#xD;
      anesthetic infiltration, and even a single low dose of intrathecal morphine administered by&#xD;
      the surgeon into the intrathecal space under direct visualization at the conclusion of the&#xD;
      surgery. But none of these methods was widely accepted due to limitations in the duration and&#xD;
      adequacy of postoperative analgesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      US guided Thoracolumbar Interfascial plane (TLIP) block is a novel technique first described&#xD;
      in a pilot study on volunteers published by William R. Hand and colleagues in Nov 2015, it&#xD;
      was designed to target the dorsal rami of the thoracolumbar nerves as they pass through the&#xD;
      paraspinal musculature (between the multifidus muscle (MF) and the longissimus muscle (LG)),&#xD;
      which is analogous to the Transversus Abdominis plane (TAP) block which targets the ventral&#xD;
      rami of the thoracolumbar nerves (between the Transversus Abdominis muscle and the internal&#xD;
      oblique muscle).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The block was performed bilaterally at the level of L3 and they reported a reproducible area&#xD;
      of anesthesia to pinprick in a mean (SD) area covering 137.4 (71.0) cm2 of the lower back&#xD;
      (including the midline) after 20 minutes of the block.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Multiple case reports for TLIP block in lumbar spine surgery were described afterwards,&#xD;
      Hironobu Ueshima and colleagues described 2 cases that required no additional postoperative&#xD;
      analgesia and no complications, then another 2 cases with nearly the same results, they&#xD;
      conducted a cadaveric study to assess the spread of injectate within the plane between the MF&#xD;
      and LG muscles using only 5ml of blue dye solution, they verified the spread of the dye to&#xD;
      the transverse process of the 3rd lumbar vertebra (level of injection) in all cadavers, so&#xD;
      they suggested that the local anesthetic's injectate into the fascial plane between the MF&#xD;
      and LG muscles can indeed block the posterior rami of the lumbar nerves.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Finally they explored the continuous variation of the block in another 2 cases with reported&#xD;
      pain free duration for 2 days (the duration of the study) and a pinprick anesthesia area&#xD;
      covering from L1 to L4 level and no complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TLIP block has the potential benefit of blocking sensations from spinal and para-spinal&#xD;
      structures involved in the surgical trauma up to 1 level above and below the level of the&#xD;
      block (including deeper structures, not only skin and subcutaneous tissues, unlike simple&#xD;
      wound infiltration), while also sparing neurological functions of the lower limb (specially&#xD;
      the motor functions) and urinary bladder functions (Voiding).&#xD;

The needle tip will be directed towards the LG/MF interface deep to the midpoint then a total volume of 20 ml of Bupivacaine 0.25% will be incrementally injected with intermittently repeated negative aspiration. Anterior spread of local anesthetic will be viewed as favourable.&#xD;
The same procedure will be repeated on the left side. The patient will then be disinfected and draped and surgery will be allowed to proceed normally.</description>
