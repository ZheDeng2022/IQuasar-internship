    <textblock>
      The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA) came into law in 2010. Originally,&#xD;
      according to the Act, a state would lose its federal Medicaid funding if it did not expand&#xD;
      its Medicaid eligibility to include all persons earning below 138% of the federal poverty&#xD;
      level on January 1, 2014. However, in a Supreme Court Case in 2012 this was ruled as&#xD;
      unconstitutional and Medicaid expansion in 2014 was made optional. Twenty four states and the&#xD;
      District of Columbia opted to expand their Medicaid programs on January 1, 2014 and the&#xD;
      remaining 26 states opting against it. Section 1115 of the Social Security Act allows states&#xD;
      to alter the federal Medicaid requirements to promote the overall state Medicaid program.&#xD;
      Among those states that expanded Medicaid Arkansas, Arizona and Iowa adopted approved Section&#xD;
      115 Waivers to expand their Medicaid programs. The variability in the states' decisions&#xD;
      regarding Medicaid expansion presented researchers with the opportunity to study the impacts&#xD;
      of Medicaid expansion on various facets of health care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is a growing body of evidence suggesting that implementation of the coverage expansions&#xD;
      under the PPACA and Medicaid expansion led to significant decreases in rate of uninsured&#xD;
      persons, increase in access to health care and improvements in affordability of healthcare.&#xD;
      Along with improving access and affordability of health care, the PPACA aimed at reducing the&#xD;
      growth rate of health care expenditures by reducing wasteful use of resources such as&#xD;
      preventable inpatient and emergency department (ED) visits. According to previous research,&#xD;
      access to primary care and insurance coverage are significantly and negatively associated&#xD;
      with experiencing preventable inpatient and ED visits. Historically, racial/ethnic minorities&#xD;
      have had lower rates of access to primary care and insurance and higher rates of preventable&#xD;
      inpatient and ED visits which might change with implementation of PPACA. Within states that&#xD;
      have expanded Medicaid, adopting different methods of expansion may also impact patterns of&#xD;
      inpatient and ED utilization and disparities in those. In the current political scenario and&#xD;
      looming uncertainty over the future of PPACA and the possibilities of modifying the PPACA it&#xD;
      might benefit policy makers to gain knowledge on the early impact of Medicaid expansions and&#xD;
      different approaches to expanding Medicaid under the PPACA. This study seeks to determine the&#xD;
      impact of Medicaid expansion and different types of Medicaid expansion on overall and&#xD;
      preventable inpatient and ED utilization and disparities in those through a three-state&#xD;
      comparison between Kentucky, Arkansas and Florida.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Another major reform under PPACA was in the area of substance use disorder treatment. Despite&#xD;
      the high societal burden exerted by patients with substance use disorders treatment rates&#xD;
      among them have been low. The most common reasons cited for the poor access to treatment have&#xD;
      been lack of insurance coverage. The PPACA required all insurance plans sold after January 1,&#xD;
      2014 to cover substance use disorder treatments. Additionally, plans were required to cover&#xD;
      screening, brief intervention and referral to treatment for substance use disorders. This&#xD;
      might potentially lead to changes in treatment rates and sources of payments for substance&#xD;
      use disorder treatment. Further, the promotion of integration between substance use disorder&#xD;
      treatment and primary care might lead to increased referrals by healthcare professionals to&#xD;
      substance use treatment. Thus, in this study we also seek to assess the impact of Medicaid&#xD;
      expansion on admission to substance use disorder treatment facilities and changes in sources&#xD;
      of payments and rate of health care referrals to those treatment facilities.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Background The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA) was signed into law by&#xD;
      President Obama on March 23, 2010. Two of the most contentious clauses under the PPACA were&#xD;
      penalizing all persons who lacked insurance after January 1, 2014 and expansion of Medicaid&#xD;
      insurance to all adults with incomes at or below 138% of the federal poverty level. The&#xD;
      constitutionality of the act came under scrutiny and led to the &quot;National Federation of&#xD;
      Independent Businesses vs Sebelius&quot; case wherein the Supreme Court upheld most of the&#xD;
      provisions of the PPACA but decided to give states the option of not expanding Medicaid and&#xD;
      at same time retain their Federal funding for the program. This Supreme Court decision&#xD;
      resulted in Medicaid expansion becoming optional for states. As of January 1, 2014 24 states&#xD;
      and the District of Columbia elected to expand Medicaid coverage as per the PPACA&#xD;
      requirements. This variation in Medicaid expansion provided natural experiments to&#xD;
      investigate the impact of expansion decisions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inpatient care accounts for the largest share of national health care expenditures in the&#xD;
      United States. There are several provisions in the PPACA which encourage coordination of care&#xD;
      between providers through use of patient centered medical homes and base provider&#xD;
      reimbursements on patient outcomes as opposed to volume of care delivered. Through such&#xD;
      reforms the PPACA aimed at reducing wasteful use of resources such as preventable&#xD;
      hospitalizations. Previous research has shown that inpatient use, specifically preventable&#xD;
      hospitalizations can be sensitive to coverage gains and can serve as an indicator of access&#xD;
      to primary care. Thus, assessing how insurance expansion under the PPACA has impacted overall&#xD;
      inpatient utilization and rate of preventable hospitalizations may provide insight on how&#xD;
      successful PPACA has been in replacing high cost wasteful services with lower cost primary&#xD;
      care services. Wherry et al, using data from National Health Interview Survey, determined a&#xD;
      positive association between the PPACA Medicaid expansion and rate of overnight&#xD;
      hospitalizations, whereas Sommers et al, using data from a survey fielded in Arkansas,&#xD;
      Kentucky and Texas found no significant association between overnight hospitalizations and&#xD;
      Medicaid Expansion. They did not detect any differences in probability of overnight&#xD;
      hospitalization and method of expansion (Arkansas vs Kentucky). However, their study was&#xD;
      limited by a small sample size and based on results of a survey. Additionally, due to lack of&#xD;
      administrative data they were unable to assess outcomes which might be more sensitive to&#xD;
      increased access to primary care such as preventable hospitalizations. To the best of our&#xD;
      knowledge only one study conducted thus far, assessed the impact of Medicaid expansion under&#xD;
      PPACA on overall inpatient utilization and rates of preventable hospitalization. However,&#xD;
      their study was limited to California, additionally different counties had different levels&#xD;
      of expansions, with some expanding coverage up to 133% FPL, some up to 200% FPL and some were&#xD;
      below 100% FPL. None of the studies thus far have determined the impact of different methods&#xD;
      of Medicaid expansion under the PPACA on rates of all-cause and preventable hospitalizations&#xD;
      using administrative data. One of the goals of the PPACA was to curb health care costs by&#xD;
      reducing the volume of care delivered at ED. Certain measures incorporated in the PPACA such&#xD;
      as increasing the number of insured persons and hence increasing access to care outside the&#xD;
      ED and integration of health care delivery may contribute to reducing ED utilization. Two&#xD;
      studies assessing the impact of Medicaid expansion on ED use also analyzed rates of&#xD;
      ambulatory care sensitive conditions (ACSC), emergent but primary care treatable conditions&#xD;
      and non-emergent ED visits. However, one study was limited to only the state of Maryland&#xD;
      lacking a comparison state which did not expand Medicaid and the other was limited to only a&#xD;
      single for-profit investor owned chain of hospitals in 6 states which expanded Medicaid and&#xD;
      14 which didn't. Furthermore, none of the studies have assessed how different methods of&#xD;
      Medicaid expansion under the PPACA impact rates of overall and non-emergent ED use.&#xD;
      Racial/ethnic disparities in various facets of health care such as insurance coverage and&#xD;
      overall access to health care is well documented in literature. Combined with the coverage&#xD;
      provisions, additional reforms made by the PPACA such as, elevating the National Center on&#xD;
      Minority Health and Health Disparities at the National Institutes of Health from a Center to&#xD;
      a full Institute, might lead to narrowing of these disparities. The studies that have&#xD;
      assessed the impact of Medicaid expansion under PPACA on disparities in inpatient use or ED&#xD;
      use have relied primarily on self-reported data which is subject to cognitive, non-response,&#xD;
      recall and other biases. Furthermore, granular measures of inpatient or ED use such as&#xD;
      preventable hospitalizations and preventable ED visits cannot be accurately obtained from&#xD;
      self-reported data. None of the studies thus far have determined the impact of Medicaid&#xD;
      expansion or different methods expansions under PPACA on disparities in types of inpatient or&#xD;
      emergency department utilization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Persons with substance use disorders (SUD) have significantly higher health-care costs,&#xD;
      higher rates of suicide attempts and disabilities compared to the general population thus&#xD;
      posing a burden to society overall. Despite this, in 2012, nearly 90% of the persons aged 12&#xD;
      and older who required treatment for SUDs did not receive adequate treatment. The lack of&#xD;
      insurance or insurance not covering SUD treatment services leading to the patient's inability&#xD;
      to pay for them are some of the most commonly cited barriers to treatment. The coverage&#xD;
      expansions under the PPACA have led to nearly 1.6 million Americans suffering from SUDs in&#xD;
      Medicaid expansion states gaining health insurance coverage. Further, under the PPACA, SUD&#xD;
      treatment is one of the ten essential health benefits that all plans must offer beginning in&#xD;
      2014. The PPACA also requires all plans to adhere to the federal Mental Health Parity and&#xD;
      Addiction Equity Act of 2008 (MHPAEA). Under this act all plans which offer mental health and&#xD;
      SUD treatment benefits to their beneficiaries must make the benefits no more restrictive than&#xD;
      medical benefits. The PPACA mandates all plans to cover screening, brief intervention and&#xD;
      referral to treatment (SBIRT) for SUDs. Along with mandating SBIRT the PPACA also encourages&#xD;
      Accountable Care Organizations and Patient Centered Medical Homes which might increase&#xD;
      coordinated care for patients suffering from SUDs. The efforts for increasing care&#xD;
      coordination and incorporating SBIRT for SUD in primary might translate to increase in number&#xD;
      of health care referrals for SUD treatment which has historically, predominantly been through&#xD;
      law enforcement agencies. Only one study has examined the impact of 2014 coverage expansions&#xD;
      on the eligible adult population (18-64 year olds). The authors used the National Survey on&#xD;
      Drug Use and Health data and found a significant increase in mental health treatment&#xD;
      utilization without any significant changes in treatment of SUDs. However, they did not draw&#xD;
      comparisons between states that expanded Medicaid vs states that did not. The study also did&#xD;
      not examine changes in sources of payment for the SUD treatment following Medicaid expansion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arkansas, Kentucky and Florida responses. Arkansas was the first state to secure an approval&#xD;
      for its &quot;Private Option&quot; demonstration project to implement the Medicaid expansion under the&#xD;
      PPACA. Arkansas adopted a premium assistance strategy, which involved using federal funds to&#xD;
      provide individual commercial health insurance for all the newly Medicaid eligible persons&#xD;
      earning up to 138% of the FPL by placing them into one of the federally qualified health&#xD;
      plans. On May 9, 2013 Governor Beshear declared that Kentucky would go ahead with Medicaid&#xD;
      expansion as proposed under the PPACA. Kentucky decided to carry out the Medicaid expansion&#xD;
      by placing the newly eligible persons in this pre-existing managed Medicaid program. Despite&#xD;
      the state's vehement opposition to the PPACA, Governor Rick Scott expressed support for a&#xD;
      &quot;limited Medicaid expansion&quot; through a federally funded and privately administered managed&#xD;
      care plan. However, Florida opted against the Medicaid expansion. This resulted in almost&#xD;
      764,000 individuals not having any affordable coverage options by virtue of not being&#xD;
      eligible for Medicaid coverage or Marketplace subsidies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Comparing inpatient and emergency room utilization between these three states will highlight&#xD;
      the impact Medicaid expansion and different approaches to Medicaid expansion might have on&#xD;
      health service utilization. Further, using national level data, comparing the change in rate&#xD;
      of SUD treatment admissions after Medicaid expansion in states that expanded Medicaid vs&#xD;
      states that did not will determine the impact of Medicaid expansion on SUD treatment&#xD;
      utilization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives and Specific Aims&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To determine the impact of Medicaid expansion and type of Medicaid expansion (purchase&#xD;
           commercial insurance vs traditional Medicaid expansion) on all cause inpatient&#xD;
           utilization and preventable hospitalizations and if effect of Medicaid expansion on&#xD;
           inpatient utilization differs by race/ethnicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Using a differences in differences approach we will compare the rate of all-cause&#xD;
                hospitalizations and preventable hospitalizations for adults aged 19-64 between&#xD;
                2013 and 2014 in the two states that expanded Medicaid vs Florida. A sub-group&#xD;
                analysis comparing Arkansas and Kentucky will reveal if different approaches to&#xD;
                expansion influenced inpatient utilization.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Using a differences in differences in differences approach we will determine&#xD;
                whether the impact of Medicaid expansion on inpatient utilization for adults aged&#xD;
                19-64 differed by racial/ethnic groups (Hispanics, Non-Hispanic Whites and&#xD;
                Non-Hispanic Blacks) between the three states.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To determine the impact of Medicaid expansion and type of Medicaid expansion on ED&#xD;
           utilization and non-emergent ED use and if the effect of Medicaid expansion on ED&#xD;
           utilization differs by race/ethnicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Using a differences in differences approach we will compare the rate of ED visits&#xD;
                and non-emergent ED visits for adults aged 19-64 between 2013 and 2014 in the two&#xD;
                states that expanded Medicaid vs Florida. A sub-group analysis comparing Arkansas&#xD;
                and Kentucky will reveal if different approaches to expansion influenced ED&#xD;
                utilization.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Using a differences in differences in differences approach we will determine&#xD;
                whether the impact of Medicaid expansion on emergency department utilization, for&#xD;
                adults aged 19-64, differed by racial/ethnic sub-groups (Hispanics, Non-Hispanic&#xD;
                Whites and Non-Hispanic Blacks) between the three states.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To determine the impact of Medicaid expansion on the rate of SUD treatment admissions in&#xD;
           facilities receiving some public support.&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Using a differences in differences in differences approach we will compare the rate&#xD;
                of SUD treatment admissions from 2010-2014 for persons aged 18-54 vs those aged&#xD;
                12-17 in the states that expanded Medicaid in 2014 vs states that did not expand&#xD;
                Medicaid in 2014.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Using a differences in differences in differences approach we will compare the&#xD;
                changes in sources of payment for the SUD treatment admissions from 2010-2014 for&#xD;
                persons aged 18-54 vs those aged 12-17 in the states that expanded Medicaid in 2014&#xD;
                vs states that did not expand Medicaid in 2014.&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Using a differences in differences in differences approach we will compare the rate&#xD;
                of health care referral for the SUD treatment admissions from 2010-2014 for persons&#xD;
                aged 18-54 vs those aged 12-17 in the states that expanded Medicaid in 2014 vs&#xD;
                states that did not expand Medicaid in 2014.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods Impact of Private Option, Traditional Medicaid Expansion and Opting Against Medicaid&#xD;
      Expansion on Inpatient Utilization: A Three State Comparison The investigators will use a&#xD;
      longitudinal cross-sectional quasi-experimental difference in difference study design to&#xD;
      assess the impact of Medicaid expansion and method of expansion on our inpatient utilization&#xD;
      measures. We will determine the change in rates of all-cause and preventable hospitalization&#xD;
      from 2013 - 2014 and contrast the change between states based on expansion/method of&#xD;
      expansion status. The investigators will use a longitudinal cross-sectional&#xD;
      quasi-experimental difference in difference in difference study design to assess the impact&#xD;
      of Medicaid expansion and method of expansion on racial/ethnic disparities on our inpatient&#xD;
      utilization measures. The investigators will determine the change in rates of all-cause and&#xD;
      preventable hospitalization from 2013 - 2014 for each race/ethnicity and contrast the change&#xD;
      between states based on expansion/method of expansion status.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data CDC - Wonder Bridged-Race Population Estimates The national center for health statistics&#xD;
      (NCHS) combines 31 race categories used in the Census to four race categories: Asian or&#xD;
      Pacific Islander, Black or African American, American Indian or Alaska Native, White and&#xD;
      provides age, gender and ethnicity (Hispanic/Non-Hispanic) specific population counts for&#xD;
      each county of the United States. These files are available for public use on CDC Wonder&#xD;
      website. We will use these files to obtain the total population counts that will serve as&#xD;
      denominators for our utilization metrics for each county of Arkansas, Florida and Kentucky&#xD;
      for 2013 and 2014.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HCUP SID For our inpatient utilization measures, the investigators will acquire the&#xD;
      Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project (HCUP) State Inpatient Database (SID) from Arkansas,&#xD;
      Kentucky and Florida respectively. The SIDs capture the particular state's hospital inpatient&#xD;
      discharge records for the given year and contain them in a uniform format to allow&#xD;
      inter-state comparisons. The unit of analysis in the dataset is a hospital discharge. In&#xD;
      addition to information each hospitalization such as length of stay, charges, admit and&#xD;
      discharge dates, the SIDs also contain clinical information such as the diagnosis recorded&#xD;
      and procedures performed during each hospitalization and demographics of the hospitalized&#xD;
      patient such as birth date, zip code of residence, gender, race, ethnicity, payer type etc.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis The investigators will depict the rates of outcomes for each state be quarter and&#xD;
      determine if there is any change in trends between 2013 and 2014 or if there is an immediate&#xD;
      change between 2013 and 2014 by using interrupted time series analysis. The investigators&#xD;
      will calculate the crude rates of all-cause and preventable hospitalization for each state&#xD;
      for each year. Using the US 2014 population as the reference population we will carry out&#xD;
      direct standardization to compute the age and sex adjusted rates of all-cause and preventable&#xD;
      hospitalizations for each state for each year. The investigators will also carry out direct&#xD;
      standardization for race/ethnicity subgroups. Next, we will perform multivariate regression&#xD;
      analysis to estimate the excess change in inpatient utilization due to Medicaid expansion.&#xD;
      The investigators will use a Poisson distribution for our outcome variables. The population&#xD;
      at risk will be the total population count of each the cohort as obtained from NCHS data.&#xD;
      Standard errors will be clustered at the emergency management region level to account for&#xD;
      nesting of each cohort within a emergency management region. The model will include emergency&#xD;
      management region level fixed effects, to account for time invariant emergency management&#xD;
      region level factors, dummies for age-group, gender race/ethnicity, and year. The&#xD;
      investigators will create indicators for period (2013 and 2014) and expansion status&#xD;
      (expanded Medicaid or not). The investigators will interact period indicator with expansion&#xD;
      status indicator to determine the excess change in the outcome measures for states which&#xD;
      expanded Medicaid (AR and KY) vs state that did not expand Medicaid in 2014 (FL). The same&#xD;
      model specification will be used to determine the impact of method of Medicaid expansion on&#xD;
      rates of all-cause and preventable hospitalizations. For this analysis, the investigators&#xD;
      will compare the 2013 and 2014 data from Arkansas and Kentucky. To assess if the impact of&#xD;
      Medicaid expansion on our outcome measures differed by racial/ethnic groups in the three&#xD;
      states we will use a multivariate difference in difference in difference model. The data will&#xD;
      be restricted to Non-Hispanic White, Hispanic and Non-Hispanic Black cohorts. In addition to&#xD;
      the terms in the prior models, we will include interactions between race/ethnicity and state&#xD;
      indicators to control for baseline disparities in the outcome in the states and interactions&#xD;
      between race/ethnicity and time to control for longitudinal trends in disparities overall.&#xD;
      The indicators for Non-Hispanic Blacks and Hispanics will be interacted with period&#xD;
      indicators and state indicators. The coefficients of these interactions will provide us with&#xD;
      the excess change in the outcome measures between Hispanic vs Non-Hispanic Whites and&#xD;
      Non-Hispanic Blacks vs Non-Hispanic Whites in states which expanded Medicaid (AR and KY) vs&#xD;
      state that did not expand Medicaid in 2014 (Referent = FL).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sensitivity Analysis The investigators will use a negative binomial distribution for our&#xD;
      outcome measures in place of a Poisson distribution. In the second sensitivity analysis, for&#xD;
      our measure of all-cause hospitalizations, the investigators will exclude all maternal&#xD;
      discharges. In a third sensitivity analysis, the investigators will include only&#xD;
      hospitalizations for adults aged 27-64 to exclude all young adults who might have experienced&#xD;
      coverage gains prior to 2014 due to the &quot;young-adult mandate&quot;. In a fourth sensitivity&#xD;
      analysis, the investigators will include only those hospitalizations that took place in&#xD;
      community hospitals. In a fifth sensitivity analysis, the investigators will collapse the&#xD;
      racial/ethnic groups and define each cohort based on year, state, emergency management&#xD;
      region, age-group and sex. The investigators will do this in order to incorporate those&#xD;
      admissions in the count of the outcome measures where the patient's race/ethnicity is&#xD;
      missing. Sixth, instead of grouping the data annually the investigators will group it by&#xD;
      quarter and perform a segmented regression analysis. Lastly, the investigators will calculate&#xD;
      all the outcome variables as rates per 10,000 persons and use weighted ordinary least squares&#xD;
      regression analysis to determine if our interpretations change.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Impact of Private Option, Traditional Medicaid Expansion and Opting Against Medicaid&#xD;
      Expansion on Emergency Department Utilization: A Three State Comparison The investigators&#xD;
      will use a longitudinal cross-sectional quasi-experimental difference in difference study&#xD;
      design to assess the impact of Medicaid expansion and method of expansion on the inpatient&#xD;
      utilization measures. The investigators will determine the change in rates of overall and&#xD;
      types of ED visits from 2013 - 2014 and contrast the change between states based on&#xD;
      expansion/method of expansion status. The investigators will use a longitudinal&#xD;
      cross-sectional quasi-experimental difference in difference in difference study design to&#xD;
      assess the impact of Medicaid expansion and method of expansion on racial/ethnic disparities&#xD;
      on our ED utilization measures. The investigators will determine the change in rates of&#xD;
      overall and types of ED visits from 2013 - 2014 for each race/ethnicity and contrast the&#xD;
      change between states based on expansion/method of expansion status.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data CDC - Wonder Bridged-Race Population Estimates HCUP SEDD For our outcome measures the&#xD;
      investigators will acquire the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project (HCUP) State Emergency&#xD;
      Department Database (SEDD) for Arkansas, Kentucky and Florida respectively. The SEDDs capture&#xD;
      all the ED visits for the particular year which take place in EDs that are affiliated with&#xD;
      hospitals and that do not result in hospitalizations. In addition to information on each ED&#xD;
      visit such as charges and admit dates, the SEDDs also contain clinical information such as&#xD;
      the diagnosis recorded and procedures performed during each visit and demographics of the&#xD;
      patient such as birth date, zip code of residence, gender, race, ethnicity, payer type etc.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome Measures&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. ED visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Type of ED visit:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Preventable/Avoidable.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Emergent. Analytic data structure Similar to previous aim, only difference would be&#xD;
                in terms of the outcomes. Analysis Similar to previous aim, only difference would&#xD;
                be in terms of the outcomes. Sensitivity Analysis The investigators will use a&#xD;
                negative binomial distribution for our outcome measures in place of a Poisson&#xD;
                distribution. In a second sensitivity analysis, we will include ED visits for&#xD;
                adults aged 27-64 to exclude all young adults who might have experienced coverage&#xD;
                gains prior to 2014 due to the &quot;young-adult mandate&quot;. In a third sensitivity&#xD;
                analysis the investigators will change our definition of preventable visits and&#xD;
                emergent visits. The investigators will define a preventable visit as any visit&#xD;
                whose probability of being preventable is ≥ 0.5 and any visit whose probability of&#xD;
                being emergent is ≥ 0.5 will be defined as such. In a fourth sensitivity analysis&#xD;
                the investigators will include only those ED visits that took place in community&#xD;
                hospitals. In a fifth sensitivity analysis we will collapse the racial/ethnic&#xD;
                groups and define each cohort based on year, state, emergency management region,&#xD;
                age-group and sex. The investigators will do this in order to incorporate those ED&#xD;
                visits in the count of the outcome measures where the patient's race/ethnicity is&#xD;
                missing. Sixth, instead of grouping the data annually we will group it by quarter&#xD;
                and perform a interrupted time series analysis. Seventh, the probability of ED&#xD;
                visit being preventable will be defined as sum of probability of ED visit being&#xD;
                non-emergent and emergent but primary care treatable and the probability of ED&#xD;
                visit being emergent will be defined as sum of probability of ED visit being&#xD;
                emergent and ED care needed. Lastly, the investigators will calculate all the&#xD;
                outcome variables as rates per 10,000 persons and use weighted ordinary least&#xD;
                squares regression analysis to determine if our interpretations change.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Early Impact of Medicaid Expansion on Public Sector Substance Abuse Treatment: Evidence from&#xD;
      the Affordable Care Act We will use a longitudinal cross-sectional quasi-experimental&#xD;
      difference in difference in difference study design. We will determine the changes in rates&#xD;
      of admissions to SUD treatment facilities, changes in the sources of payment and changes in&#xD;
      the rate of health care referrals from 2010 - 2014 for persons aged 18-54 vs 12-17 and&#xD;
      compare the changes between them based on states' Medicaid expansion status.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Treatment Episode Data Set - Admissions (TEDS-A) TEDS-A is a nationwide administrative&#xD;
      database of admissions to specialty SUD treatment facilities. It consists of facilities that&#xD;
      receive some public source of funding for providing SUD treatment. Some of the states collect&#xD;
      data only on admissions that are publically funded whereas others also collect privately&#xD;
      funded admissions from facilities that receive some public funding. TEDS-A includes data on&#xD;
      the demographics of the patient including age-group, gender, race/ethnicity, state of&#xD;
      residence, substances abused, type of facility, payment source for the admission for a&#xD;
      sub-group of states and source of referral to the treatment. It covers nearly 80% of SUD&#xD;
      treatment admissions in the US.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Current Population Survey (CPS) The CPS reports monthly information on population&#xD;
      demographics including age, race/ethnicity, gender, state of residence etc. We will use this&#xD;
      data to get information on total population counts for our cohorts developed on the basis of&#xD;
      age-group (12-14, 15-17, 18-29, 30-39, 40-54), gender, race/ethnicity (Non-Hispanic White,&#xD;
      Hispanic, Non-Hispanic Blacks, Others), state and year and state-level covariates. The&#xD;
      investigators will exclude New Hampshire and Michigan from our data to avoid ambiguity since&#xD;
      these states expanded later in 2014. To assess impact of Medicaid expansion on changes in&#xD;
      payment source for SUD admissions the investigators will include only those states which&#xD;
      provide primary payer information in the TEDS files for at least 85% of the admissions in&#xD;
      each of the years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome Measures&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Treatment admissions.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Source of payment&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Treatment admissions privately funded.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Treatment admissions funded by Medicaid.&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Treatment admissions self-funded.&#xD;
&#xD;
             4. Treatment admissions that are free/ or funded by other government sources.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Treatment admissions through a health care source of referral Analytic Data Structure We&#xD;
           will sum all the outcome measures from the TEDS-A data by state, year, age, gender, and&#xD;
           race/ethnicity. The investigators will ink the CPS data and the aggregate level TEDS&#xD;
           file files. The investigators will gather the covariate information from the CPS data at&#xD;
           the state-year level which will give us our final analytic dataset to assess the impact&#xD;
           of Medicaid expansion on SUD treatment in publically funded facilities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis The investigators will compare the demographics of the admissions and covariates&#xD;
      between states that expanded Medicaid vs states that did not expand Medicaid for each year of&#xD;
      the study period. The investigators will conduct t-tests/chi-square to determine significant&#xD;
      differences for continuous and categorical variables respectively. The investigators will sum&#xD;
      up all the outcome measures for each state and plot them year wise on separate graphs to&#xD;
      visually examine the trends. The investigators will perform multivariate regression analysis&#xD;
      to estimate the excess change in our outcome measures attributable to Medicaid expansion. The&#xD;
      investigators will use a Poisson distribution for outcome variables. The population at-risk&#xD;
      will be the population count of each cohort. The model will include state level fixed&#xD;
      effects, to account for time invariant state level factors, and dummies for age-group,&#xD;
      gender, period indicator (pre-expansion vs post-expansion), race/ethnicity, state-year level&#xD;
      covariates (marital status, educational attainment, and proportion unemployed), and time&#xD;
      varying state-policies (eg. legalizing medical marijuana). The investigators will create&#xD;
      indicators for period before and after Medicaid expansion (2014 and 2010-2013) and expansion&#xD;
      status of state (expanded Medicaid or not) and an indicator for treatment group (12-17 vs&#xD;
      18-54). The investigators will interact period indicator with expansion status indicator to&#xD;
      control for overall trend in outcome in states that expanded vs states that did not expand.&#xD;
      The investigators will interact the treatment indicator with period indicator to control for&#xD;
      overall trend in outcome among treatment group (18-54 year olds) vs non-treatment group&#xD;
      (12-17 year olds). The investigators will also control for baseline differences in the&#xD;
      outcome among treatment group (18-54 year olds) vs non-treatment group (12-17 year olds) in&#xD;
      states that expanded vs states that did not expand by interacting expansion status with&#xD;
      treatment group indicator. The model will include a difference in difference in difference&#xD;
      indicator to assess the effect of Medicaid Expansion on the outcome measure among treatment&#xD;
      group (18-54 year olds) vs non-treatment group (12-17 year olds). The difference in&#xD;
      difference in difference indicator will be specified by interacting the expansion, treatment&#xD;
      and period indicators.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sensitivity Analysis The investigators will conduct a number of sensitivity analyses to test&#xD;
      the robustness of our model and study subject selection criteria. First, The investigators&#xD;
      will use a negative binomial distribution for the outcome counts instead of Poisson&#xD;
      distribution. Second, The investigators will exclude persons aged 18-29 to eliminate the&#xD;
      population that had an increase in access to insurance in 2010 due to the &quot;young adult&#xD;
      mandate&quot;. The age-group that was impacted by the mandate was 18-26. However, due to the&#xD;
      availability of age-groups in the TEDS-A data (18-20, 21-25 and 26-29) The investigators&#xD;
      decided to include the entire 18-29 age-group. Third, consistent with previous literature The&#xD;
      investigators will exclude admissions only for detoxification since these are considered to&#xD;
      be forerunners for treatments rather than treatment itself. Fourth, The investigators will&#xD;
      determine the impact of Medicaid expansion only on rate of first time admission. Finally, The&#xD;
      investigators will conduct a weighted least squares regression for each of our outcome&#xD;
      measures. Here the weights will be the population counts for each cohort. The outcomes will&#xD;
      be as follows: a. rate of treatment admissions, privately funded admissions, Medicaid funded&#xD;
      admissions, self-funded admissions, admissions payed for by charity or other government&#xD;
      organizations, admissions through health care referrals per 10,000 persons.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Limitations Proposed studies on the impact of Medicaid expansion on inpatient and ED&#xD;
      utilization have several limitations. The investigators analyze data from only three states,&#xD;
      hence our findings might not be generalizable to other states of the US. Although Florida is&#xD;
      a southern state, it is significantly different in terms of demographic composition from&#xD;
      Arkansas and Kentucky. However, since the rate of uninsured in the three states was similar&#xD;
      prior to Medicaid expansion we believe that it would serve as a reasonable control.&#xD;
      Additionally, The investigators do not have access to data from other southern states which&#xD;
      did not expand Medicaid in 2014 and which might be better controls such as Texas, Tennessee,&#xD;
      Mississippi, Louisiana or Georgia. The investigators have access to only one year of&#xD;
      post-reform data hence The investigators might not be able to capture the full impact of the&#xD;
      health care reform. Since The investigators have only one year of pre-reform data we might&#xD;
      not be able to fully account for differences in trends of the outcomes pre-reform in our&#xD;
      three states. Our third study is subject to limitations as well. TEDS-A data does not include&#xD;
      all the substance abuse treatment centers. Thus, The investigators may potentially miss some&#xD;
      of the admissions. Our findings might be biased by showing higher rates of admissions in&#xD;
      states have greater public funding by virtue of them contributing more data. Further since&#xD;
      the funding may fluctuate annually, The investigators cannot ascertain whether the changes in&#xD;
      treatment rates are a function of the fluctuations in reporting or due to Medicaid expansion.&#xD;
      The investigators mitigate this limitation to some extent by including the 12-17 age group as&#xD;
      a control group which will not be impacted by the Medicaid expansion but if there are changes&#xD;
      in reporting rates for states The investigators expect them to have equal effect on 12-17&#xD;
      years olds as on 18-54 year olds. Not all states provide information on source of funding,&#xD;
      thus limiting the generalizability of our findings about the changes in source of payment.&#xD;
      However, previous research has shown no differences in states that provide data on sources of&#xD;
      funding vs states that do not.&#xD;
