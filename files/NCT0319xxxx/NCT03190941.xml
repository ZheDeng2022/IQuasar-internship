  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A new cancer therapy involves taking white blood cells from a person, growing them in the&#xD;
      lab, genetically modifying them, then giving them back to the person. This therapy is called&#xD;
      gene transfer using anti-KRAS G12V mTCR cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To see if anti-KRAS G12 V mTCR cells are safe and can shrink tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adults at least 18 years old with cancer that has the KRAS G12V molecule on the surface of&#xD;
      tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In another protocol, participants will:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Be screened&#xD;
&#xD;
      Have cells harvested and grown&#xD;
&#xD;
      Have leukapheresis&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this protocol, participants will have the procedures below.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be admitted to the hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Over 5 days, participants will get 2 chemotherapy medicines as an infusion via catheter in&#xD;
      the upper chest.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A few days later, participants will get the anti-KRAS G12V mTCR cells via catheter.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For up to 3 days, participants will get a drug to make the cells active.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A day after getting the cells, participants will get a drug to increase their white blood&#xD;
      cell count. This will be a shot or injection under the skin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will recover in the hospital for 1-2 weeks. They will have lab and blood tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will take an antibiotic for at least 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have visits every few months for 2 years, and then as determined by their&#xD;
      doctor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visits will be 1-2 days. They will include lab tests, imaging studies, and physical exam.&#xD;
      Some visits may include leukapheresis or blood drawn.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have blood collected over several years.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  We generated an HLA-A*11:01-restricted murine T-cell receptor (mTCR) that specifically&#xD;
           recognizes the G12V-mutated variant of KRAS (and other RAS family genes), expressed by&#xD;
           many human cancers and constructed a single retroviral vector that contains its alpha&#xD;
           and beta chains that confers recognition of this antigen when transduced into PBL.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In co-cultures with HLA-A*11:01+ target cells expressing this mutated oncogene, mTCR&#xD;
           transduced T cells lyse target cells and secrete IFN-gamma with high specificity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Phase I: determine the safety of administering PBL transduced with anti-KRAS G12V mTCR&#xD;
           in concert with preparative lymphodepletion and high dose interleukin-2 (IL-2;&#xD;
           aldesleukin).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Phase II:To determine if anti-KRAS G12V mTCR-transduced PBL can mediate the regression&#xD;
           of tumors harboring the RAS G12V mutation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients must be/have:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Age greater than or equal to 18 years and less than or equal to 70 years&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  HLA-A*11:01 positive&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Metastatic or unresectable RAS G12V-expressing cancer which has progressed after&#xD;
           standard therapy (if available).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients may not have:&#xD;
&#xD;
      -Allergies or hypersensitivities to high-dose aldesleukin, cyclophosphamide or fludarabine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  This is a Phase I/II, single center study of PBL transduced with anti-KRAS G12V mTCR in&#xD;
           HLA-A*11:01 positive patients with advanced solid tumors expressing G12V mutated RAS.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  PBMC obtained by leukapheresis will be cultured in the presence of anti-CD3 (OKT3) and&#xD;
           aldesleukin in order to stimulate T-cell growth.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Transduction is initiated by exposure of these cells to retroviral vector supernatant&#xD;
           containing replication-incompetent virus encoding the anti-KRAS G12V mTCR.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  All patients will receive a non-myeloablative, lympho-depleting preparative regimen of&#xD;
           cyclophosphamide and fludarabine.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  On day 0 patients will receive their PBL transduced with the anti-KRAS G12V mTCR and&#xD;
           will then begin high-dose aldesleukin.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A complete evaluation of lesions will be conducted approximately 6 weeks (+/- 2 weeks)&#xD;
           after treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The study will be conducted using a phase I/II Simon minimax design, with two separate&#xD;
&#xD;
      cohorts for the Phase II component: Cohort 2a, patients with RAS G12V pancreatic&#xD;
&#xD;
      cancer, and Cohort 2b, patients with RAS G12V non-pancreatic cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      -A total of 110 patients may be required; approximately 24 patients in the phase I portion of&#xD;
      the study and 86 (41, plus an allowance of up to 2 non-evaluable per phase II cohort)&#xD;
      patients in the phase II portion of the study.&#xD;
