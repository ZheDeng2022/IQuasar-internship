      This study is a prospective, single-arm, multi-center, pilot trial of Bronchoscopic Thermal&#xD;
      Vapor Ablation for Lung Cancer (BTVA-C) in patients with primary lung cancer or metastatic&#xD;
      cancer in the lung. Patients who have consented to participate in this study (enrolled) will&#xD;
      be subject to eligibility screening and baseline assessments, prior to undergoing the BTVA-C&#xD;
      procedure. Only patients that meet all of inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion&#xD;
      criteria will receive vapor ablation treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will receive BTVA-C treatment followed by standard-of-practice surgical resection.&#xD;

      This study is a prospective, single-arm, multi-center, pilot trial of Bronchoscopic Thermal&#xD;
      Vapor Ablation for Lung Cancer (BTVA-C) in patients with primary lung cancer or metastatic&#xD;
      cancer in the lung.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects identified for this study will be those that have a surgical resection already&#xD;
      scheduled as part of their lung cancer treatment. Patients who have consented to participate&#xD;
      in this study (enrolled) will undergo screening assessments to evaluate the inclusion&#xD;
      criteria associated with their lung cancer and general health. Only patients that meet all of&#xD;
      the inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria will be scheduled for treatment&#xD;
      with the BTVA-C System.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 8 subjects will be treated at up to 2 investigational sites in Australia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior to the vapor ablation procedure, the patient's CT scan is analyzed to evaluate the&#xD;
      location and size of the target lesion. The segments and airways associated with the lesion&#xD;
      are identified and images are created to aid in the navigation to appropriate treatment&#xD;
      locations during the upcoming procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the time of the vapor ablation procedure, the Uptake catheter is placed in a selected&#xD;
      airway with a thin bronchoscope. A balloon at the distal end of the catheter is then inflated&#xD;
      to occlude the bronchus prior to vapor infusion. Sterile water is heated to approximately&#xD;
      100°-140°C by a reusable Generator and vapor (steam) is infused into the targeted region for&#xD;
      8 seconds at a precisely controlled flow rate and power. If necessary, the catheter is moved&#xD;
      to the next airway and the procedure is repeated until all desired airways have been treated&#xD;
      (maximum 3 treatments). The treatment creates a uniform field of necrosis in the parenchyma&#xD;
      around the lesion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The interval between vapor ablation and the surgical resection will be a minimum of 60 hours&#xD;
      to a maximum of 105 hours, with the exact scheduling determined by the investigator. The&#xD;
      resected tissue will undergo pathological evaluation for tissue viability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to standard post-operative follow-up, patients will be evaluated at Day 7 (± 2&#xD;
      days) and Day 30 (± 5 days) post-resection to assess safety and feasibility.&#xD;
