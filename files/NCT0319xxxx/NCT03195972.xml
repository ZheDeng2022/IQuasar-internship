  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Oral anticancer treatments are increasingly numerous. They represent an additional&#xD;
      alternative in the therapeutic arsenal of the clinician, and appear to satisfy patients who&#xD;
      prefer this route of administration over intravenous treatment. The objective of oral&#xD;
      therapies is twofold: to remove the constraints and risks associated with infusions and to&#xD;
      allow the patient to follow his treatment at home.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, they have significant adverse effects that may affect patients, who are sometimes at&#xD;
      a disadvantage compared to how they are treated, and potentially lead to non-compliance with&#xD;
      the consequences.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will identify the factors associated with non-adherence and determine the impact&#xD;
      of this non-adherence in terms of treatment efficacy and tolerance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this routine care study is to evaluate the adherence to oral anticancer therapies&#xD;
      during 3 months.&#xD;

      Primary objective&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To evaluate adherence to oral anti-cancer therapies at 3 months&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the adherence to 3 months according to the age of the patients (less than 75&#xD;
           years versus 75 years and more)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluate compliance at 1 and 2 months&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluate toxicity at 1, 2 and 3 months according to compliance according to criteria&#xD;
           CTCAE 4.03.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluate response to treatment at 3 months based on adherence&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluate the factors associated with adherence and describe the reasons for&#xD;
           non-adherence.&#xD;
