      This study is designed to demonstrate that the performance of the AL-SENSE developed by&#xD;
      Common Sense Ltd. is safe and effective and can be used to indicate if the patient may be&#xD;
      experiencing an amniotic fluid leakage or a &quot;water breaking&quot;. The AL-SENSE is an extended&#xD;
      shelf-life product that is technically simple, fast to react, visually readable, and&#xD;
      therefore enables women to test the cause of any unidentified wetness. An additional,&#xD;
      secondary objective is to show that the AL-SENSE is associated with levels of sensitivity and&#xD;
      specificity that are comparable to those specified for the currently marketed AMNIOTESTTM&#xD;
      (nitrazine yellow swabs; PRO LAB Diagnostics) product.&#xD;

      Baseline/ Screening&#xD;
&#xD;
      Potential subjects may undergo the informed consent process in the outpatient clinic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects attending the labor and delivery unit of the hospital or emergency clinic and&#xD;
      reporting unidentified wetness (undetermined whether this is amniotic fluid leakage or&#xD;
      urinary incontinence) will be enrolled in this study. After informed consent is obtained,&#xD;
      each subject will be given a single AL-SENSE to use up to 12 hours or until the perception of&#xD;
      wetness. The clinician will explain the proper use and handling of the AL-SENSE and how to&#xD;
      read the result. The participants will be provided with instructions for use and also&#xD;
      directed to read the Instructions For Use (IFU) prior to applying the AL-SENSE pad.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Product Usage After usage, the subject will read and record any occurrence of color change of&#xD;
      the AL-SENSE 10 minutes after the liner removal and to mark if it changes color to blue or to&#xD;
      green or not on the designated form.. The used liner will be placed in a separate sealed&#xD;
      envelope with the subject's ID and product name and protocol number on the outside.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The subjects will fill out the questionnaire regarding the product usage experience and the&#xD;
      liner color reading with no help from the investigator, to validate IFU reading&#xD;
      comprehension. The completed form will be placed in a sealed envelope with the subject's&#xD;
      initials and study number on the outside.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical Diagnosis A blinded clinician will perform a &quot;standard clinical diagnosis&quot; (clinical&#xD;
      assessment), and record the results on a worksheet to be included in the case report form.&#xD;
      The standard clinical diagnostic methods will include the following tests: (1) Pooling test,&#xD;
      (2) Ferning test, (3) Nitrazine paper or pH paper test. A positive Pooling test and/or&#xD;
      positive results in both the Nitrazine or pH test and the Ferning test will be defined as a&#xD;
      positive clinical test result for amniotic fluid.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although the preferred sequence is using the liner before clinical diagnosis, diagnostic&#xD;
      procedures may be done before liner use, as long as lubricants are not used for procedures.&#xD;
      The use of lubricants interferes with the accuracy of liner reaction to amniotic fluid.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the liner is removed for clinical testing before sufficient fluid has collected, it may&#xD;
      either be reused or a fresh liner may be dispensed. Note that any use of lubricants&#xD;
      contraindicates further usage of Al-Sense.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The subject is expected to remain at the hospital for the duration of the test for completing&#xD;
      the &quot;standard clinical diagnosis&quot; tests, required by the protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A positive Pooling test or positive results in the other 2 tests is defined as a positive&#xD;
      clinical assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although the performance of the AL-SENSE is examined in this study, subject treatment will be&#xD;
      based only on the standard hospital diagnostic methods.&#xD;

    <description>The primary efficacy endpoints are: presence or absence of a blue- green stain on a yellow background as observed by the subject yielded by the AL-SENSE in addition to the binary clinical diagnosis (positive/negative), in order to assess the sensitivity and specificity of the AL-SENSE versus the standard clinical diagnosis.</description>

    <description>The secondary endpoints of this study are: presence or absence of a blue-green stain on a yellow background as yielded by the AL-SENSE and observed by the clinician and a measurement of patient comfort while using AL-SENSE and reading the results. This will help demonstrate the ability of the subject to accurately interpret the AL-SENSE test results.</description>

    <description>The AL-SENSE reacts differently when in contact with amniotic fluid than it does with urine. The indicator changes color to blue-green and fades back to yellow in case of urine and changes to stable blue-green in case of amniotic fluid.</description>
