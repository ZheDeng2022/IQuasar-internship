  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Children with brain tumors who have had radiation therapy are at risk for problems with&#xD;
      attention, memory, and problem solving. Such problems may cause difficulty in school and&#xD;
      daily life. Memantine, the drug being used for this study, is not yet approved for use in&#xD;
      children by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. However, studies have shown some&#xD;
      improvements in memory for patients with dementia, Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder,&#xD;
      and autism. Scientists have also used this medication for adult cancer patients receiving&#xD;
      radiation therapy with results showing less cognitive declines over time compared to patients&#xD;
      taking a placebo (inactive pill). These studies have also shown few side effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a pilot/feasibility study and the first known study involving children with a cancer&#xD;
      diagnosis or brain tumor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To estimate the participation rate in a study of memantine used as a neuro-protective&#xD;
           agent in children undergoing radiotherapy for localized brain tumors (low grade glioma,&#xD;
           craniopharyngioma, ependymoma, or germ cell tumor)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To estimate the rate of memantine medication adherence&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To estimate the rate of completion of cognitive assessments&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To estimate the effect size of change in neurobehavioral outcomes (cognitive, social,&#xD;
           quality of life, neurologic) associated with memantine&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the frequency and nature of memantine side effects as measured by the&#xD;
           Systematic Assessment for Treatment Emergent Events (SAFTEE)&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Participants will be randomized to take part in one of two groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The Memantine Group will be prescribed memantine at a dosage following FDA-approved&#xD;
           adult labeling. A low dose will initially be given beginning at least two weeks (± 7&#xD;
           days) prior to beginning radiation therapy. The dose will increase until participants&#xD;
           reach the target dose of 20 mg/day. Memantine will be given for a total of 12 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The Placebo Group will be prescribed identical capsules with no active drug. The placebo&#xD;
           drug will be given in the same dose and frequency as described for the Memantine group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will undergo the same evaluations and monitoring throughout the medication&#xD;
      phase. Assessments will be done at baseline prior to study start, with follow-up assessments&#xD;
      at 6 weeks (end of radiation therapy), and 12 weeks (end of study medication). Psychological&#xD;
      testing to measure attention, working memory, problem solving, intelligence and academics&#xD;
      will be done for each participant. Caregivers will also complete questionnaires about&#xD;
      attention, problem solving, mood and interpersonal interactions. Caregivers will also be&#xD;
      asked to complete a questionnaire about the family's general characteristics and medical&#xD;
      history.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the time points noted above, blood work, vital signs and echocardiograms will be obtained,&#xD;
      and the study neurologist will examine the participant to monitor side effects and&#xD;
      neurological functioning. A study nurse will contact the participant once per week during the&#xD;
      12 weeks of medication administration to identify possible medication-related side effects&#xD;
      and to check on rate of compliance with taking the medication. A remote app will be installed&#xD;
      on the participant's home computer or cell phone to help remind them to take the medication&#xD;
      and track success. At one year post medication, psychological and neurological examinations&#xD;
      will be repeated.&#xD;
