  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study will be a double-blind, randomized, crossover, single-dose assessment of&#xD;
      IV-administered GC4711 compared to GC4419 in healthy volunteers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Consenting subjects will undergo screening procedures within 28 days of the start of dosing.&#xD;
      Pharmacokinetics (parent drug and major metabolites) will be assessed in plasma and urine&#xD;
      from all subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Initially, a sentinel cohort of 4 subjects, will be enrolled; each eligible subject will&#xD;
      receive single dose of GC4711 IV at dose of 30 mg over one hour. Following a clinical safety&#xD;
      review by the Galera study team , if no safety concerns are identified after the last subject&#xD;
      completes study participation, enrollment will continue in 2 stages to a crossover study&#xD;
      design. In stage 1, 12 subjects will be enrolled and in stage 2, if no safety concerns are&#xD;
      identified in stage 1 following a clinical safety review by the Galera study team, 20&#xD;
      subjects will be enrolled. In both enrollment stages, eligible subjects in the crossover&#xD;
      design will be randomized in 1:1 ratio to one of two treatment sequences: Test (GC4711) -&gt;&#xD;
      Ref (GC4419) or Ref (GC4419) -&gt; Test (GC4711). On Day 1, subjects will receive the first&#xD;
      treatment they were randomized to, and on Day 4 (following a washout), they will receive the&#xD;
      second treatment. Subjects will be followed up for 2 days after the second treatment.&#xD;
