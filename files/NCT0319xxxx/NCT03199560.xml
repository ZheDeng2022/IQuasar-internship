      A randomized controlled double-blinded study comparing the intraoperative injection of&#xD;
      lymphatic mapping agents Tc 99m tilmanocept to Tc 99m filtered sulfur colloid in breast&#xD;
      cancer patients undergoing breast conservation and sentinel lymph node biopsy&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This study is a double-blinded randomized control trial comparing tilmanocept to TSC as&#xD;
      intraoperative radiolabeled mapping agents in female patients with early stage breast cancer&#xD;
      undergoing partial mastectomy with SLNBx.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To secure this aim, patients who are schedule to undergo partial mastectomy and SLBx will be&#xD;
      consented and randomized (randomization table) into one of two experimental arms, tilmanocept&#xD;
      or TSC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These patients will then undergo their scheduled partial mastectomy with SLNBx, with the&#xD;
      patient and surgeon blinded to the randomization result.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The respective radiotracers will both be delivered to the OR in the same delivery device and&#xD;
      volumes to continue to preserve anonymity of the material. Care will be taken to handle the&#xD;
      radiotracers along the standards and guidelines that are already in practice in Memorial&#xD;
      Health University Hospital's nuclear medicine department. Two intradermal injections of these&#xD;
      radiotracers will be delivered at 3 and 6 o'clock positions at the edge of the areola, after&#xD;
      induction of general anesthesia, allowing for less discomfort to the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methylene blue (5-10 ml) will also be injected in the subareolar space immediately afterwards&#xD;
      in all study patients, using a separate syringe, in accordance with the surgeon's current&#xD;
      standard practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Transcutaneous probing of the axilla measuring counts per second will be performed in 3&#xD;
      minute intervals after injection of the radiotracer. Incision in the axilla can, at the&#xD;
      earliest, be at 15 minutes, as this is the FDA approved earliest time for tilmanocept. At&#xD;
      this time, if the transcutaneous &quot;hot spot&quot; detected by the gamma detector probe is detected,&#xD;
      an incision for SLNBx will proceed. A hot spot is defined as an area of increased&#xD;
      radioactivity in the axilla with a fall-off in radioactive counts in adjacent tissue. If a&#xD;
      hot spot is not detected, transcutaneous probing will continue at 3 minute intervals until&#xD;
      this value is reached. In an effort to not prolong the anesthesia time, incision at 30&#xD;
      minutes will be performed even if a hot spot is not identified transcutaneously.&#xD;
&#xD;
      No changes will be made to the method of SLNBx for this study. As axillary lymph node&#xD;
      dissection is no longer the standard of care at the time of SLNBx in partial mastectomy, we&#xD;
      will continue the practice of sending the SLN for permanent sectioning, however this will be&#xD;
      at the surgeon's discretion. If at the time of surgery there are histologically metastatic&#xD;
      nodes or if a sentinel node cannot be identified, the surgeon can proceed to axillary lymph&#xD;
      node dissection at their discretion, however for the purposes of this study only SLN data&#xD;
      will be tracked (please see below for further information on data collection).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Description of method for SLNBx:&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the intradermal injection of tilmanocept or TSC and sub-areolar injection of methylene&#xD;
      blue, and the decision to proceed with SLNBx, the standard incision will be made in the&#xD;
      axilla overlying the area with the most counts per second per the gamma probe. The&#xD;
      subcutaneous tissues are then dissected to the clavipectoral fascia. The fascia is then&#xD;
      incised and the axilla is again probed with the gamma probe. Once a blue node or radioactive&#xD;
      node(s) is detected they are excised. A radioactive node will be defined as having counts per&#xD;
      second that are 10 times higher than surrounding tissue (background count). Once excised, an&#xD;
      &quot;ex-vivo&quot; count will be taken of the sentinel node(s) and recorded. If the background&#xD;
      radiation of the axilla is less than 10% the counts per second (cps) of the &quot;hottest&quot;&#xD;
      harvested sentinel lymph node, the search for radioactive sentinel nodes will be deemed&#xD;
      complete. If there is greater than 10% the counts per second remaining in the axilla, then&#xD;
      additional nodes will be identified and excised using the same methods until the background&#xD;
      radiation is less than 10% the counts per second of the hottest sentinel nodes removed.&#xD;
      Additional nodes which are blue but not radioactive will be excised, as will any clinically&#xD;
      suspicious nodes.&#xD;
