  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML) is due to a chromosomal abnormality in white blood cells&#xD;
      which results in abnormal multiplication. CML in its earlier, slower growing chronic phase&#xD;
      (CP) is well controlled by the tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) drug imatinib, which targets&#xD;
      the consequences of the chromosomal abnormality, inducing a response and subsequent remission&#xD;
      (as measured using molecular techniques on patient blood or bone marrow samples in the lab).&#xD;
      Dasatinib, a newer TKI drug, similar in design to imatinib, gives a more rapid molecular&#xD;
      response, however the long term side-effects are less known than imatinib.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will investigate the efficacy and safety of a treatment plan for patients with&#xD;
      newly diagnosed CML-CP, where dasatinib will be used to more rapidly induce a molecular&#xD;
      response (MR3.0) within 12 months, after which imatinib will be used to maintain the CML in&#xD;
      that remission. It is hypothesised that imatinib is safe and effective in maintaining MR3.0&#xD;
      in patients with CML who achieve MR3.0 at 12 months following initial induction therapy with&#xD;
      dasatinib.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The KISS Study is a Phase II, multicentre, open-label, prospective non-randomised study of&#xD;
      treatment modification in response to maintenance of MR3.0 at 12 months. Patients must be&#xD;
      newly diagnosed with chronic phase CML (CML-CP) (&lt;3 months) and previously untreated with the&#xD;
      exception of hydroxyurea.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be recruited from hospital haematology clinics. The majority of patients will&#xD;
      have been referred to a haematologist due to suspected CML. Written informed consent will be&#xD;
      ensured before any study-specific procedures are undertaken or study data collected, however&#xD;
      the majority of assessments carried out for this study are based on standard of care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients' eligibility will be determined by the usual procedures carried out for CML&#xD;
      diagnosis. Results from both diagnostic procedures and confirmatory screening procedures will&#xD;
      constitute baseline data. Once a patient has had their eligibility confirmed and has signed&#xD;
      informed consent, they will be enrolled into the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The trial consists of two stages:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stage 1: The first 12 months after recruitment (before the possible switch to imatinib).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stage 2: Months 13 - 37.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following measurements/data will be recorded throughout the trial at protocol specified&#xD;
      time points:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Haematology and biochemistry.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  PB Q-PCR for BCR-ABL1.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Chest x-ray, ECG, ECHO.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Medical assessment including physical exam, ECOG performance, weight, vital signs,&#xD;
           assessment of extra medullary disease (liver, lymph nodes and spleen), spleen&#xD;
           measurement below left costal margin, adverse events and concomitant medications.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Haematological and molecular response assessments.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Treatment adherence assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patient questionnaire (MDASI-CML).&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will commence dasatinib (Sprycel®) 100 mg daily. Molecular monitoring of blood&#xD;
      BCR-ABL1 transcripts to measure molecular response will occur 3 monthly by Q-PCR as per&#xD;
      standard of care procedures. Patients who achieve a BCR-ABL1 level of ≤ 0.1% (MR3.0) by 12&#xD;
      months on treatment will switch treatment to imatinib 400 mg daily if MR3.0 is confirmed at&#xD;
      13 months (and they give their consent to switch). Those patients who do not achieve MR3.0 at&#xD;
      12 months or MR3.0 is not confirmed at 13 months, will remain on dasatinib. Patients with&#xD;
      confirmed MR3.0 who choose not to switch to imatinib will continue on dasatinib. Patients&#xD;
      that are intolerant of dasatinib in the first 12 months, those that switch to imatinib at 12&#xD;
      months and then lose MR3.0 or those intolerant of imatinib will be treated off study.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>A Phase II, multicentre, open-label, prospective non-randomised study of treatment modification in response to maintenance of MR3.0 at 12 months.&#xD;
Molecular response will be measured 3 monthly. Patients who achieve MR3.0 by 12 months, with a confirmed response at 13 months on treatment, will switch treatment to imatinib. Those patients who do not achieve this confirmed response will remain on dasatinib.&#xD;
For patients who achieve confirmed MR3.0 by 13 months we define two study stages. Stage 1 is the first 12 months after recruitment (i.e. before the possible switch to imatinib) and Stage 2 includes the months 13 - 37.</intervention_model_description>
