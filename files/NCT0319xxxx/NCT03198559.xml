  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Antiretroviral therapy (ART) dramatically reduces Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV)&#xD;
      replication leading to restoration of immune function and a near normal life expectancy, but&#xD;
      treatment is lifelong and there is no cure. The major barrier to a cure is the persistence of&#xD;
      long lived cluster of differentiation 4 (CD4+) T-cells that contain a &quot;silenced&quot; form of HIV,&#xD;
      called HIV latency.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this research is to investigate whether it may be possible to reduce the&#xD;
      amount of dormant HIV infection in immune cells, by &quot;turning on&quot; or activating the virus and&#xD;
      hence force it out of the latently infected memory T cells. This leads to production of HIV&#xD;
      by the cell, which will either die or will be recognized and eliminated by the immune system.&#xD;
      As very few T cells are latently infected with HIV, the death of these cells is not expected&#xD;
      to affect the function of the immune system and further infection of new cells is expected to&#xD;
      be prevented by ART.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      One strategy aimed at reducing the frequency of latently infected cells in HIV-infected&#xD;
      individuals on antiretroviral therapy (ART) is the use of pharmacological agents to reverse&#xD;
      HIV latency, thereby initiating virus-mediated cell lysis or immune-mediated killing. Recent&#xD;
      clinical trials of latency reversing agents (LRAs) in HIV infected subjects on ART, including&#xD;
      histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACi) and the anti-alcoholism drug disulfiram, have shown&#xD;
      that inducing an increase in Cell Associated Unspliced (CA-US) HIV RNA or plasma HIV RNA is&#xD;
      possible. Yet, these interventions did not have a demonstrable effect on the frequency of&#xD;
      latently infected cells or time to viral rebound after cessation of ART, potentially because&#xD;
      latency reversal alone didn't trigger an adequate immune response or cell death or that the&#xD;
      potency of latency reversal with a single-agent intervention over a very short period of&#xD;
      time, lacked sufficient potency, as suggested by recent in vitro studies. It is highly likely&#xD;
      that long-term remission off ART will require interventions that lead to both a reduction in&#xD;
      latently infected cells and an increase in HIV-specific immunity, therefore identifying a&#xD;
      strategy to increase viral antigens on the surface of latently infected cells will be a key&#xD;
      component of this strategy.&#xD;
