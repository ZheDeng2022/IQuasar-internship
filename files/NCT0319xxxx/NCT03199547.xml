    <textblock>
      Though maternal and neonatal health are high priority areas for international development,&#xD;
      maternal and neonatal mortality remain unacceptably high. Worldwide there are 1 million&#xD;
      maternal and 4 million neonatal deaths every year and half of them occur in sub-Saharan&#xD;
      Africa.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post-partum and neonatal severe bacterial infections, namely sepsis, are leading causes of&#xD;
      maternal and neonatal deaths in sub-Saharan Africa. Newborns can be infected during labour -&#xD;
      when passing through the birth canal - and also during the first days/weeks of life, as a&#xD;
      consequence of the close physical contact with the mother, when the latter carriers bacteria.&#xD;
      As the mother is an important source of bacterial transmission to the newborn, treating&#xD;
      mothers with antibiotics during labour should decrease their bacterial carriage and therefore&#xD;
      lower transmission to the newborn. As carriage is a necessary step towards severe disease,&#xD;
      this intervention should in turn result in the lower occurrence of severe bacterial disease&#xD;
      and mortality during the neonatal period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In many high-income countries, pregnant women are screened during pregnancy for vaginal&#xD;
      carriage of Group B Streptococcus, the bacteria responsible for the vast majority of neonatal&#xD;
      sepsis in the developed world. If women are carriers, they are treated with intravenous&#xD;
      antibiotics during labour to decrease the risk of severe disease to their off-spring.&#xD;
      Although this intervention has been successful in developed countries, infrastructure and&#xD;
      resource limitations in regions like sub-Saharan Africa prevent both screening and use of&#xD;
      intravenous antibiotics. Also, in Africa several bacterial pathogens are responsible for&#xD;
      neonatal sepsis and the antibiotics needed in the continent should cover a wider number of&#xD;
      bacteria; and ideally cover also bacteria responsible for severe post-partum disease in the&#xD;
      mother.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will conduct a large trial in West Africa, The Gambia and Burkina Faso, with the main&#xD;
      objective of determining if a single dose of an oral antibiotic given to women during labour&#xD;
      decreases newborn mortality. The trial will also assess the effect of the antibiotic on&#xD;
      lowering newborns and maternal hospitalization during the first week's post-partum. We have&#xD;
      selected an antibiotic (azithromycin) that in sub-Saharan Africa has already been used for&#xD;
      elimination of other prevalent diseases such as trachoma. This antibiotic is safe, requires a&#xD;
      single oral administration, has no special storage requirements and has the potential to&#xD;
      eliminate most of the bacteria commonly causing severe disease in newborns and post-partum&#xD;
      women in the continent. Very important this antibiotic is not widely used in clinical care in&#xD;
      the continent, and therefore, any temporal increase of resistance induced by the intervention&#xD;
      should not have implications on current treatment guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before going to the large trial proposed here (12,000 women to be recruited), we have&#xD;
      generated robust preliminary data on the effect of the intervention in a proof-of-concept&#xD;
      trial conducted in The Gambia (829 women and their offspring recruited). We found that in&#xD;
      fact, babies born from mothers who had taken this antibiotic during labour were less likely&#xD;
      to carry bacteria that can potentially cause severe disease. These babies were also three&#xD;
      times less likely to have bacterial skin infections or umbilical infections, both highly&#xD;
      common among African newborns. Besides, fever or mastitis (again both very common in the&#xD;
      region) during the post-partum period were four times lower among mothers who had taken the&#xD;
      antibiotic during labour. Such trial confirmed our hypothesis of impact on bacterial&#xD;
      transmission but it was too small to assess the effect of the antibiotic on mortality and&#xD;
      hospitalizations. The preliminary trial also showed that women from the azithromycin group&#xD;
      were less likely to need antibiotics for treatment infections during the puerperal period,&#xD;
      decreasing then the pressure on the scarcity of antibiotics available in the continent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The advantages of our approach are its simplicity, low cost and the possibility of protecting&#xD;
      both mothers and babies with the same intervention.&#xD;

      Dr Marc Tahita Clinical Research Unit of Nanoro Burkina Faso BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE&#xD;
      Neonatal and maternal sepsis are major contributors to the high burden of mortality in&#xD;
      sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). Bacterial infections are leading causes of neonatal deaths,&#xD;
      representing 1 out of 3 deaths in this age group (1).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Neonatal sepsis is the consequence of bacterial infection during early life. Newborns may be&#xD;
      infected during labour (through the birth canal) or during the first days/weeks of life, when&#xD;
      they may become infected because of the close physical contact with the mother, if the latter&#xD;
      carries bacteria (i.e. in the nasopharyngeal tract), a common occurrence in resource-limited&#xD;
      settings, particularly in SSA. Streptococcus pneumoniae and group A Streptococcus are&#xD;
      important in the late neonatal period (from the second week of life), while group B&#xD;
      Streptococcus (GBS), Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli occur often in both the early&#xD;
      and late neonatal periods (2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      AZI is a semi-synthetic azalide macrolide that is structurally related to erythromycin but&#xD;
      has a broader spectrum of antibacterial activity, improved tissue penetration and a more&#xD;
      favourable pharmacokinetic profile (3). Azithromycin is a cheap, wide spectrum, oral&#xD;
      antibiotic that is safe to use in mothers and newborns, does not require special storage&#xD;
      conditions, and can be delivered at the most peripheral level of care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Between 2013 and 2015, we conducted as first proof-of-concept, a double-blind randomized&#xD;
      trial on the effect of 2g of AZI administered to Gambian women in labour on maternal and&#xD;
      neonatal bacterial carriage (4). The primary endpoint was bacterial carriage at day 6 in the&#xD;
      newborn (i.e. S.aureus, GBS or S.pneumoniae). The rationale for the study was that this&#xD;
      intervention would decrease bacterial carriage of the study bacteria both, in the mother and&#xD;
      the newborn and consequently the risk of invasive bacterial disease or sepsis. We found that&#xD;
      the intervention substantially reduced the prevalence of carriage of each of these three&#xD;
      bacteria, both in the newborn and the mother, during the entire neonatal/puerperal period&#xD;
      (4).&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
      1 Maternal nasopharyngeal swab at day 0: collected before the intervention was given.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our study also showed that women in the AZI group had a lower prevalence of the study&#xD;
      bacteria in the breast milk during the entire neonatal period (day 6: 9.6% vs 21.9%, RR=0.44,&#xD;
      p&lt;0.001) and in the vaginal tract (8-10 days: 13.2% vs 24.2% RR=0.55 - p&lt;0.001).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although the study was not designed to evaluate clinical endpoints, prevalence of these&#xD;
      endpoints decreased significantly in the AZI group (5). The use of antibiotics, and the&#xD;
      occurrence of fever, mastitis and puerperal infections were significantly lower in the AZI&#xD;
      group (Table 1). Newborns in the intervention group had fewer infections (skin infections,&#xD;
      umbilical infections, ear infections, conjunctivitis or mild sepsis) during the neonatal&#xD;
      period (Table 2). There were also fewer neonatal deaths due to severe infections in the AZI&#xD;
      group (0.4% versus 1.4% excluding neonates with severe congenital malformations).&#xD;

      p-values from the log-rank test (mothers p=0.001, newborns p=0.04) AZI was safe for both the&#xD;
      mothers and the newborns. Hypertrophic pyloric stenosis (HPS) was not observed in any of the&#xD;
      study children during the 2-month follow up period (4).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Azithromycin is a cheap, wide spectrum, oral antibiotic that is safe to use in mothers and&#xD;
      newborns, does not require special storage conditions, and can be delivered at the most&#xD;
      peripheral level of care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the trial presented here, we want to assess the impact of using AZI during labour on&#xD;
      neonatal mortality as well as maternal and neonatal sepsis and infant growth. If successful,&#xD;
      this simple intervention could be easily implemented through the health system at the most&#xD;
      peripheral level of care. It has the potential to achieve wide coverage in SSA where low-cost&#xD;
      interventions aiming at reducing neonatal mortality are urgently needed. In addition, the&#xD;
      intervention should concomitantly protect women and newborns. Azithromycin resistance will&#xD;
      also be monitored as the former trial showed high rates of AZI resistance for S. aureus.&#xD;
      However, AZI is not widely used in SSA for clinical treatment and therefore any short-term&#xD;
      resistance arising from the intervention would have little impact on clinical care.&#xD;

           TRIAL DESIGN&#xD;
&#xD;
           This is a multi-country phase III, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomised trial in&#xD;
           which 12,500 women in labour will be randomised to receive either a single dose of 2g of&#xD;
           oral azithromycin or placebo (ratio 1:1). Pregnant women (age ≥16 years) will be&#xD;
           identified during antenatal clinic visits in several health facilities in The Gambia and&#xD;
           Burkina Faso; and will be asked to provide written informed consent. Recruitment will&#xD;
           take place when these women attend the study health facilities in labour.&#xD;
&#xD;
           INCLUSION AND EXCLUSION CRITERIA Pregnant women (age ≥16 years) will be identified&#xD;
           during antenatal clinic visits and asked to provide written informed consent. During&#xD;
           labour they will be screened and recruited unless they have any of the following&#xD;
           exclusion criteria: planned caesarean section, ante-partum haemorrhage, known allergy to&#xD;
           macrolides, confirmed intrauterine death or a known severe congenital malformation. The&#xD;
           randomisation number will only be assigned after the screening.&#xD;
&#xD;

           their newborns. Approximately half of this number of women will be recruited in The&#xD;
           Gambia and half in Burkina Faso. However, the recruitment will be competitive and if one&#xD;
           country does not reach the numbers within the time period expected, the other will&#xD;
           increase the recruitments.&#xD;

           active visits are only for participants included in one of the sub-studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
           All study participants will be followed for 28 days. During this follow-up period,&#xD;
           samples will be collected if they are hospitalized with suspicion of sepsis (mothers and&#xD;
           newborns). Clinical samples to conduct sepsis work up will be collected. For newborns&#xD;
           hospitalized with clinical suspicion of sepsis, we will also collect nasopharyngeal&#xD;
           swabs (NPS), oropharyngeal swabs (OPS) and rectal swabs (RS).&#xD;
&#xD;
           For 250 participant pairs recruited in the carriage sub-study. Samples will be collected&#xD;
           according to the table below.&#xD;

&#xD;
           For infants of the first 1,000 mothers s participating in the anthropometrical&#xD;
           sub-study. These children will be followed for 1 year but no additional samples will be&#xD;
           collected. Anthropometric information will be collected during the additional visits at&#xD;
           6, 9 and 12 months; and information of AE will be collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
           CENTRES INVOLVED IN THE TRIAL&#xD;
&#xD;
           In The Gambia, we will conduct the trial at Bundung Maternal and Child Health Hospital&#xD;
           and Serrekunda Health Facility. Bundung Maternal and Child Health Hospital is where the&#xD;
           proof-of-concept trial was conducted. The hospital delivers approximately 5,000 babies&#xD;
           each year and is located on the Gambian coast, 15 km from the MRC The Gambia&#xD;
           headquarters. Pregnant women usually have 2-3 antenatal visits during the second and&#xD;
           third trimester and they are kept in the health centre for approximately 6 hours after&#xD;
           delivery. Serrekunda Health Facility is located approximately 15Km from both the Bundung&#xD;
           Maternal and Child Health Hospital and the MRC The Gambia headquarters. Approximately,&#xD;
           2,000 deliveries take place per year. In The Gambia, maternal mortality ratio is 461&#xD;
           deaths/100,000 live births (4) and infant mortality rate is above 50 deaths/1,000 live&#xD;
           births (5).&#xD;
&#xD;
           In Burkina Faso, the study will be carried out at the Clinical Research Unit of Nanoro&#xD;
           (CRUN) located in the rural central west region of the country. In 2013, the total&#xD;
           population of the Nanoro Health district was estimated at 158,127 people. There are 14&#xD;
           peripheral health facilities (covering 70 villages) around the referral hospital, all&#xD;
           with maternity and extended program of immunizations (EPI) services. Seven to 10 of&#xD;
           these health facilities will be part of the trial. The epidemiological profile of&#xD;
           diseases remains dominated by communicable infectious diseases. Maternal mortality rate&#xD;
           is 300 deaths/100,000 live births and infant mortality rate is 78.3 deaths/1,000 live&#xD;
           births. A Health and Demographic Surveillance System (HDSS), which covers a total&#xD;
           population of about 60,000 people in 24 villages (7 health facilities) was set up in&#xD;
           2009 by the CRUN within the Health district catchment area.&#xD;
&#xD;
           ALLOCATION OF PARTICIPANTS Randomisation lists based on permuted blocks will be created&#xD;
           independently for each country, and blister packs will be numbered according to the&#xD;
           list. The trial will comply with Good Clinical Practices (GCP).&#xD;
&#xD;
           RISK TO THE SAFETY OF THE TRIAL&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Hyperpyloric stenosis (HPS). Azithromycin is associated with HPS in infants (6)&#xD;
                although it is uncertain in the context of azithromycin treated breast feeding&#xD;
                women (7). Typically, infants with HPS do not show any symptoms at birth but they&#xD;
                develop projectile vomiting and other metabolic abnormalities during the first few&#xD;
                weeks of life. Data generated in our pilot study showed that azithromycin reaches&#xD;
                the breast milk and traces are still detectable in samples collected at day 28 (8).&#xD;
                There is some evidence that HPS is less frequent in SSA (9). In our pilot study&#xD;
                none of the 419 children whose mother received azithromycin developed HPS (8).&#xD;
                Nevertheless, newborns will be carefully followed up for signs of HPS.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Azithromycin resistance. Azithromycin is not routinely used for clinical care in&#xD;
                SSA and has a wide antimicrobial spectrum (10). For these reasons it has been used&#xD;
                in several successful mass drug administration (MDA) campaigns, including trachoma&#xD;
                and yaws control and elimination (11;12), and in clinical trials for the prevention&#xD;
                of malaria in pregnancy and preterm births (13). Most studies have shown to varying&#xD;
                degrees that resistant bacteria can be selected after a single dose. Nevertheless,&#xD;
                in the absence of antibiotic pressure, resistance disappears due to the lower&#xD;
                fitness of resistant bacteria (14). Studies that have used azithromycin for MDA, in&#xD;
                which thousands of people were treated at the same time, have shown that&#xD;
                S.pneumoniae resistance is only maintained for more than a few months in&#xD;
                communities where the baseline prevalence of resistance is high (15). In The Gambia&#xD;
                azithromycin resistance after MDA for trachoma elimination reverted to baseline&#xD;
                levels 6 months after the intervention (16). In our pilot study, resistance of&#xD;
                S.aureus was high 28 days after treatment but decreased to baseline levels 12&#xD;
                months after treatment (Bojang et al in prep). As azithromycin is not used in&#xD;
                standard clinical care, there would be little selective pressure on resistant&#xD;
                bacteria. In addition, it is interesting to note that in our pilot trial women in&#xD;
                the azithromycin group used other antibiotics less often than women in the placebo&#xD;
                arm (2). This suggests that the intervention might decrease selective pressure on&#xD;
                the few antibiotics available for standard clinical care in the region. Resistance&#xD;
                to azithromycin and other antibiotics among the trial participants will be assessed&#xD;
                in the proposed study.&#xD;
&#xD;
           SAMPLE SIZE CALCULATION In our proof-of-concept trial, the prevalence of bacterial&#xD;
           carriage in the azithromycin group decreased by more than 50%, and there were 6 neonatal&#xD;
           deaths (1.4%) (primary endpoint as defined above) in the placebo arm compared to 2&#xD;
           (0.4%) in the azithromycin arm (70% reduction).&#xD;
&#xD;
           We assume that mortality in the placebo arm will be at least 1.4% - this is a&#xD;
           conservative estimate as in the proof-of-concept trial neonates were closely followed up&#xD;
           during the first week of life and this probably decreased the risk of death. Assuming&#xD;
           the intervention reduces neonatal mortality by 40%, we would need 5,800 women per arm to&#xD;
           show a significant difference at 80% power and 5% significance level. And allowing for&#xD;
           8% loss to follow-up, we would need to recruit a total of 12,500 women.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Up to two thirds of these women will be recruited in the Gambia, and the remainder will&#xD;
           be recruited in Burkina Faso, depending on the pace of recruitment in both countries.&#xD;
           Maternal and infant mortality rates in these two countries are similar. The sample size&#xD;
           would also provide reasonable power for the secondary endpoints of maternal and neonatal&#xD;
           infection, hospitalisation and antibiotic use, since their occurrence is higher than&#xD;
           neonatal death.&#xD;
&#xD;
           As during the trial we have observed a mortality of approxiamtely half of the expected,&#xD;
           we have modified the endpoint to a composite endpoint of mortality or sepsis. This&#xD;
           composite endpoint prevalence is approximately 2.1% of the total sample size. Assuming&#xD;
           the intervention reduces the endpoint by 28%, 12,000 participants gives us 80% power at&#xD;
           a 5% significance level to detect differences by study arm.&#xD;
