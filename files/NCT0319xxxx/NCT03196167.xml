      The purpose of this study is to demonstrate faster time to extubation after arrival in the&#xD;
      cardiothoracic intensive care unit (ICU) in patients undergoing isolated coronary artery&#xD;
      bypass grafting (CABG), AVR and AVR/CABG combination who receive Sugammadex as compared to&#xD;
      placebo.&#xD;

      Primary Efficacy Objective: To demonstrate faster time to extubation after arrival in the&#xD;
      cardiothoracic ICU in patients having a CABG who receive Sugammadex 2mg/kg as compared to&#xD;
      placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypotheses: We hypothesize that the use of Sugammadex for reversal of residual neuromuscular&#xD;
      blockade in adults undergoing CABG, AVR or CABG/AVR combination surgery in the cardiothoracic&#xD;
      ICU will significantly decrease the time to extubation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prolonged intubation after cardiac surgery continues to be a common clinical challenge and is&#xD;
      associated with significant risks and costs(1-5). Despite a Class I recommendation by the&#xD;
      American College of Cardiology supporting care directed towards early postoperative&#xD;
      extubation after low to medium risk Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting (CABG) surgeries (6), a&#xD;
      sizable proportion of patients continue to have a prolonged course of cardiothoracic&#xD;
      intensive care unit (CTICU) intubation(1). Residual neuromuscular blockade (NMB) continues to&#xD;
      be one of the key factors leading to prolonged intubation after cardiac surgery(7). It is&#xD;
      also a significant contributor to postoperative pulmonary and respiratory complications&#xD;
      including hypoxia, upper airway obstruction; and decreased oxygen saturation - often&#xD;
      prompting reintubation in critical care units(8-10). Due to the profound effects that&#xD;
      neuromuscular reversal agents other than Sugammadex have when used in combination with&#xD;
      muscarinic acetylcholine receptor antagonists on the autonomic nervous system and patient&#xD;
      hemodynamics, these traditional reversal drugs are rarely used in the postoperative cardiac&#xD;
      surgery patient population (11) as opposed to other general surgical cases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sugammadex, a gamma-cyclodextrin drug, rapidly reverses neuromuscular blockade by&#xD;
      encapsulating the non-depolarizing amino steroids agents(12) and is not associated with&#xD;
      cardiovascular effects that are commonly seen with traditional NMB reversal agents(13). It&#xD;
      can also reverse NMB more quickly and predictably than existing agents(14). However, there&#xD;
      have been sporadic reports of hypotension(15), anaphylaxis(16), elongated a PTT(17) with the&#xD;
      use of Sugammadex. Additionally, although the FDA currently lists Sugammadex as indicated for&#xD;
      reversal of neuromuscular blockade induced by rocuronium and vecuronium in adults undergoing&#xD;
      surgery,(18) its use in the post cardiac surgery setting is limited due to lack of supportive&#xD;
      data. In this context, the present study aims to test the effectiveness of a pragmatic and&#xD;
      broadly applicable care pathway for shortening time to extubation among patients in the&#xD;
      cardiothoracic ICU who have undergone isolated CABG, AVR or CABG/AVR combination procedure.&#xD;
      The FDA-approved package insert is attached as an appendix to this application.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design: Prospective, randomized, double blind, single center placebo-controlled trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Number of participants: 110 enrolled with assumed randomization of 90 using 1:1 randomization&#xD;
      between active ingredient (intervention) and control arms, to be assigned randomly using a&#xD;
      computer generated algorithm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subject Recruitment: Subjects will be consented in the collaborating surgeons offices or in&#xD;
      pre-admission testing. Every effort will be made to consent subjects prior to day of surgery.&#xD;
      If a patient is referred or identified any time after those visits, they may be consented in&#xD;
      the preoperative area.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anesthetic management per protocol:For enrolled patients, anesthetic management will be left&#xD;
      to the discretion of the attending anesthesiology provider. As per our usual clinical&#xD;
      practice, Rocuronium or vecuronium will be used as the non-depolarizing NMB and that where&#xD;
      sedation is desired and appropriate, The patients will be transferred to the CTICU intubated&#xD;
      and on a propofol infusion and/or dexmedetomidine per our usual clinical practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Upon CTICU arrival, determination of continued eligibility will be determined. If the&#xD;
      decision is made to continue on a fast-track extubation pathway, eligible patients will be&#xD;
      randomized, investigational pharmacy will be contacted for study drug. 30 minutes after the&#xD;
      ICU admission, propofol will be discontinued. Precedex may be continued per clinical&#xD;
      discretion. The participant will be randomized to either receive Sugammadex or placebo. A&#xD;
      qualitative train-of-four measurement will be obtained. The administration of the study and&#xD;
      placebo compounds will be performed by CTICU nurses who will receive the drugs in a blinded&#xD;
      fashion from the departmental research pharmacy. The level of neuromuscular blockade will be&#xD;
      measured by accelerometer before and after the drug/placebo administration by the research&#xD;
      coordinator. This will be done by placing a sheet over the limb being tested, so that the&#xD;
      clinical team remains blinded to the results of the drug /placebo administration. The study&#xD;
      drug will be supplied by Merck. Patients will be initiated on SIMV with 40% FiO2, tidal&#xD;
      volumes 8-10 ml/kg and PEEP of 5.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ten minutes after the drug administration, if the patient is able to lift head and remains&#xD;
      hemodynamically stable, the patient will be switched to CPAP mode of ventilation for 30&#xD;
      minutes. At the end of the CPAP trial tidal volumes, Rapid Shallow Breathing Index (RSBI) and&#xD;
      ABG will be assessed. The patient will be extubated if he/she is not hypoxic/ hypercarbic,&#xD;
      has RSBI&lt;100 and has TV &gt;300 cc. The final clinical decision to extubate the patients will be&#xD;
      taken by the CTICU team.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If a patient fails the 30 minute CPAP criteria, the ICU intensivist will be immediately&#xD;
      notified. Every attempt will be made to correct the underlying cause of CPAP failure, and a&#xD;
      prompt reassessment will be made as deemed appropriate by the intensivist to reattempt CPAP&#xD;
      versus continuing controlled mechanical ventilation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is estimated conservatively that the study personnel will randomize 3 patients per week&#xD;
      allowing for data collection to be completed within 1 year of study commencement. Data&#xD;
      analysis and dissemination of findings will be conducted over the subsequent 6 months by the&#xD;
      study institution investigators per the publication plan below.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blinded analyses of the data will be performed by the study investigators along with the&#xD;
      departmental statistician in the Department of Anesthesiology at the Yale School of Medicine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Variables/Time Points of Interest: The primary outcome is the time to extubation, which will&#xD;
      be the duration from arrival to the ICU to the extubation time. Participants' blood pressure,&#xD;
      heart rate, and chest tube output will be tracked from arrival to the CTICU until extubation&#xD;
      per ICU protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Methods:Baseline comparability. We expect that the randomization process will&#xD;
      produce reasonably comparable groups. However, the adequacy of the randomization will be&#xD;
      assessed by comparing the distribution of baseline demographic and clinical characteristics&#xD;
      among the intervention groups. Comparability for continuous variables will be examined&#xD;
      graphically and by summary statistics (means, medians, quartiles, etc.). Categorical&#xD;
      variables will be examined by calculating frequency distributions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Proposed statistical test/analysis: Positively skewed variables will be log-transformed prior&#xD;
      to hypothesis testing. For the primary outcome, a two-sided Student's t-test will be used to&#xD;
      compare the time to extubation between the two groups. If necessary, covariate adjustment&#xD;
      will be made using the multiple linear regression analysis method. Differences between means&#xD;
      and 95% confidence intervals will be estimated to describe the magnitude of intervention&#xD;
      difference between the two groups. As part of sensitivity analyses, the time-to-extubation&#xD;
      outcome will be also analyzed by the Cox regression model. To compare the categorical adverse&#xD;
      events between two groups, chi-square test or Fisher's exact test will be used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Missing Data: Prevention is the most obvious and effective manner to control bias and loss of&#xD;
      power from missing data. Therefore, several strategies (e.g., timely data entry and daily&#xD;
      missing data report) will be imposed to limit the likelihood that missing data will occur&#xD;
      during this study. This protocol will follow the intention to treat principle, requiring&#xD;
      follow-up of all subjects randomized regardless of the actual treatment received.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Power analysis: Our 'in-house' historical data (n = 73) showed that after excluding outliers&#xD;
      greater than the 80th percentile, patients undergoing isolated CABG demonstrated a mean of&#xD;
      8.39 hours to extubation (SD 2.89). Although we anticipate a Hawthorne effect demonstrating&#xD;
      reduced time to extubation in both the active and placebo arms of the present study, we have&#xD;
      conservatively chosen to maintain power based on historical data. We therefore estimate that&#xD;
      45 subjects per group will give us 90% power to detect a clinically relevant effect size of&#xD;
      2-hours difference between active and placebo groups at an alpha value of 0.05 using a&#xD;
      two-sided two-sample t-test. To allow for post consent, pre-randomization study drop out, we&#xD;
      will aim to enroll a total of 110 (90 + 20 = 110) subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Per-protocol Sensitivity Analysis: In parallel with the primary analysis, if exclusions above&#xD;
      occur post randomization but prior to drug administration, the investigators will conduct a&#xD;
      parallel &quot;per-protocol&quot; sensitivity analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Drug supplies will be supplied by the sponsor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adverse Experience Reporting: Throughout the duration of the study, researchers will adhere&#xD;
      to good clinical practice and the guidelines of the institution. Patient vitals will be&#xD;
      continuously monitored during and after the administration of the test drug. A data and&#xD;
      safety monitoring board (DSMB) consisting of the head nurse and a senior critical care staff&#xD;
      will meet monthly to discuss any serious events. Any incidence of anaphylaxis or unexplained&#xD;
      hypotension requiring initiation of pressors or cardiac pacing within 5 minutes of drug&#xD;
      administration will be reported an evaluated. Increases in chest tube output considered&#xD;
      clinically significant by the critical care team will be noted. Any of these adverse events&#xD;
      will trigger an analysis by the DSMB. If the DSMB determines that study drug may be causing&#xD;
      an increase in adverse events, the study will be suspended until the DSMB is able to fully&#xD;
      review the events and make a recommendation in consultation with the Yale Human&#xD;
      Investigations Committee. The local Merck research representative will also be notified about&#xD;
      the events. If the data monitoring board and/or institutional review board (IRB) view that&#xD;
      the study is unsafe, the study will be discontinued.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Safety Events to Be Reported During Manuscript Preparation: For manuscript&#xD;
      preparation, the rates of hypotension, anaphylaxis, and bleeding (i.e. Chest Tube output)&#xD;
      will be reported and compared between active and placebo groups.&#xD;
