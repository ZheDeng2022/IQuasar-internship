      Impact on expected post-operative complications with impulsive compression of vein complexes&#xD;
      in foot of patient operated on with insitu bypass for acute/chronic leg ischemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Purpose/aim:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To investigate whether compression therapy with foot pump reduce post-operative edema,&#xD;
      facilitate wound healing of the operation wounds, promote healing of ischemic ulcers and&#xD;
      shorten hospitalization, increase and improve the patient's subjective quality of life&#xD;
      faster.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Insitu bypass to the lower extremity are the standard operation choice on patients with&#xD;
      critical leg ischemia. Approximately 18% of patients wound problems, which prolong their&#xD;
      hospitalization time and convalescence. One of the reasons for wound problems is swelling,&#xD;
      which occurs in connection with the legs process of revascularization (angiogenesis). One can&#xD;
      expect that the leg, 10 cm below the patella will undergo swelling with approximately 6-8%&#xD;
      during the first day, and up to 8-10% after four days in connection with the inset bypass&#xD;
      surgery. Early mobilization can prevent the swelling to become too pronounced. By mobilizing&#xD;
      you stimulate the natural venous pump in the leg. Patients are often hard to mobilize in an&#xD;
      early stage due to the wound and age. Stimulation of the venous plexus in the arch of the&#xD;
      foot has in other categories of patients shown to reduce swellings of leg and thrombosis risk&#xD;
      in patients undergoing orthopedic surgery on the lower extremities .&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is no description of treatment of Vascular surgical patients with foot pump to be found&#xD;
      in literature.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patient's subjective quality of life is often impaired in relation to the above mentioned&#xD;
      surgical treatment. A quicker recovery can be compatible with rapidly regained quality of&#xD;
      life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is no analysis or meta Cochrane reviews in this field.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Plan and material:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Procedure: Patients follow the normal procedure in the department in terms of insitu&#xD;
      bypass.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Asked in the outpatient's clinic at visit for preparation for the operation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Method:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Time schedule for measuring assessing symptoms as pain, edema and swelling:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measuring the leg swelling&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The night before the operation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The day after the operation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Day 4 and the day of patient discharge.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Day 30 (control in our open clinic for control of the operation results).&#xD;
&#xD;
           The measure procedure will be as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
           The circumference of the leg will be measured at 10 cm below the distal part of the&#xD;
           patellae. In the same procedure pain by the Visual analogue scale (VAS) will evaluated&#xD;
           and edema at the ankle in the same leg by digital pulpal pressure on the skin. The r&#xD;
           reaction will be noted (fast recovery or slow) the depth of the dimple will be noted.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Operation is planned.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Post operation, foot pump is placed on foot, according to randomization. Pump must be&#xD;
           placed on foot immediately after arrival to ICU. Foot pump will be left on foot until&#xD;
           full mobilization is reached. The control group follows the department's ordinary&#xD;
           post-operative routines for inset bypass, i.e. compression stockings or short-stretch&#xD;
           bandage.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The compression stocking is a TED stocking with 18 mmHg pressure at the ankle and&#xD;
           short-stretch bandage is a padded bandage that stretch from the toes and up to the upper&#xD;
           thigh with a 40 mmHg pressure.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Time for full mobilization is recorded in all patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Reoperations is noted.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Toe pressure is measured at inclusion, immediately post-op and at discharge.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Time for discharge is noted.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Para clinical factors to be examined.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Duplex study of reverse flow in the deep veins associated with standard duplex study of&#xD;
           AV fistulas post-operatively.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Quality of life questionnaire (vascu Qol)&#xD;
&#xD;
           EQ-5D baseline + 6-month&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Risks, side effects and disadvantages:&#xD;
&#xD;
           The foot pump treatment is non-invasive. Patients bear no ache nor pain in connection&#xD;
           with the treatment method. The pump is used in other European countries on an empirical&#xD;
           basis and CE mark.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Duplex study is done as routine examinations in the department and is non-invasive.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The side effects and risks of pump therapy can be considered as insignificant.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Patient integrity:&#xD;
&#xD;
           The project reported to the data monitoring via the regions&quot; paraplyanmelselse&quot; to the&#xD;
           data inspectorate.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The law on treatment of personal data will be respected.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Data application sheet:&#xD;
&#xD;
           A data application sheet will be created for all the included patients. The information&#xD;
           will be fed into the database for analysis. Usernames and passwords will be created for&#xD;
           login for all trial related personnel.&#xD;
&#xD;
           - Publication: The results of the study will be presented at national and international&#xD;
           meetings and conventions. The end result will be published in an international magazine.&#xD;
&#xD;
           - Ethical considerations: Wound complications associated with vascular surgery is a&#xD;
           major problem for both patients and vascular surgeons. All that is possible to bring the&#xD;
           infection rate down is good for patients and hospital systems. If we simultaneously can&#xD;
           shorten the hospitalization time and improve the quality of life for patients, it will&#xD;
           mean that we have accomplishment. This study is a win-win project without inflicting the&#xD;
           trial subjects no significant risks or side effects. For research and surgical&#xD;
           discipline, it can be of great importance to show the advantage with the foot pump&#xD;
           treatment in a study. And thereby awaken the interest in foot pumps among other medical&#xD;
           specialities.&#xD;
&#xD;
           - Informed consent: Patients with critical leg ischemia, where there are taken a&#xD;
           decision on inset bypass, is offered to participate in the trial by ambulatory visit.&#xD;
           There will be a sheet with written information handed out and the patients will also&#xD;
           receive information orally about the trial. The patient now has the option for&#xD;
           consideration until the randomization will happen at admission to operation. The oral&#xD;
           information will be given by the research nurse and study physician. The patient and&#xD;
           Doctor/nurse call on a study room in the outpatient clinic at Department of Vascular&#xD;
           surgery, Hospital Lillebaelt, Denmark.. The patient is given the written information to&#xD;
           take home for reading and have the opportunity to have an observer present at the&#xD;
           hospital where the patient must submit a statement of participation in the study. The&#xD;
           tome between ambulatory visit and hospitalization in usually seven to 14 days depending&#xD;
           on the severity of the patient's ischemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
           - Patient Insurance: The subject is covered by the patient compensation scheme in the&#xD;
           region of southern Denmark.&#xD;
