      Infective endocarditis (IE) is an infection of cardiac valves. IE mainly involves bacteria,&#xD;
      more rarely fungi. IE is an uncommon diseases with an estimated incidence of 1-12 cases per&#xD;
      100,000 inhabitants per year. The diagnostic of IE relies on the culture of biological&#xD;
      samples (blood cultures and per-operative samples) in the bacteriology laboratory in order to&#xD;
      identify the pathogen and its susceptibility to antimicrobials. Nonetheless in about 10% of&#xD;
      the cases, the blood cultures remain negative, due to antibiotics taken before harvesting, to&#xD;
      non-culturable bacteria or to aseptic phenomena.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical metagenomics is defined as the application of high-throughput sequencing (NGS)&#xD;
      followed by a specific bioinformatics analysis to obtain clinical information, i.e. pathogen&#xD;
      identification and the prediction of their susceptibility to antimicrobials. The metagenome&#xD;
      of a sample (i.e. all the genomes of the organisms present) virtually contains all the&#xD;
      information necessary for bacteriological diagnosis: what is the pathogenic bacteria , and to&#xD;
      which antibiotics it is susceptible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hence, using clinical metagenomics in the context of IE appears seducing in order to overcome&#xD;
      the limitations of conventional methods based on culture. Here, we propose to assess the&#xD;
      performance of clinical metagenomics in the diagnostic of IE.&#xD;

      Background and Rationale Infective endocarditis (IE) is an infection of cardiac valves. IE&#xD;
      mainly involves bacteria, more rarely fungi. IE is an uncommon diseases with an estimated&#xD;
      incidence of 1-12 cases per 100,000 inhabitants per year. The diagnostic of IE relies on the&#xD;
      collection of biological samples (blood cultures and per-operative samples) and their culture&#xD;
      in the bacteriology laboratory, referred to as conventional methods.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This process, practically unchanged since the time of Pasteur at the end of the 19th century,&#xD;
      has the disadvantage of allowing the only detection of the bacteria that can be grown under&#xD;
      the usual conditions of a laboratory. If most pathogenic bacteria can do so, some bacteria&#xD;
      that may be involved in IE (eg Coxiella sp., Bartonella sp., Tropheryma whipplei) require&#xD;
      very specific conditions to multiply. In addition, the prior intake of antibiotics by the&#xD;
      patient before the sample collection may negatively influence the culture of the samples. The&#xD;
      diagnosis of IE is evoked by considering a range of clinical arguments (fever,&#xD;
      microbiological risk behavior (positive blood culture(s), serology (for Coxiella burnettii),&#xD;
      echography (presence of an intra-cardiac mass, abscess, leakage and / or disinsertion of a&#xD;
      valve), all of which are minor and major criteria for determining the certainty of IE. The&#xD;
      treatment of IE is based on prolonged antibiotics (4 to 6 weeks for the majority of cases)&#xD;
      and valvular surgery (according to precise indications).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In about 10% of the cases, however, the blood cultures remain negative. These are known as&#xD;
      negative culture IE, which may be due to antibiotics taken before sampling, to non-culturable&#xD;
      bacteria or to aseptic phenomena. The broad-range PCR which consists of amplifying by PCR&#xD;
      then sequencing a fraction of the 16S RNA encoding gene can then be used. It allows the&#xD;
      identification of the pathogenic bacterium, but does not give information on any resistance&#xD;
      acquired to antibiotics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Concept of clinical metagenomics Clinical metagenomics is defined as the application of&#xD;
      high-throughput sequencing (NGS) followed by a specific bioinformatics analysis to obtain&#xD;
      clinical information, i.e. pathogen identification and the prediction of their susceptibility&#xD;
      to antimicrobials. The metagenome of a sample (i.e. all the genomes of the organisms present)&#xD;
      virtually contains all the information necessary for bacteriological diagnosis: what is / are&#xD;
      the pathogenic bacteria (s), and to which antibiotics it/they is/are susceptible. The concept&#xD;
      of clinical metagenomics has developed in parallel with the new DNA sequencing technologies&#xD;
      introduced in the mid-2000s and much more efficient in terms of throughput than the&#xD;
      sequencing method described by Sanger. While this concept is attractive, there are still many&#xD;
      obstacles to its implementation. First, clinical specimens from bacterial infections usually&#xD;
      contain a high concentration of leukocytes, the genome of which is about 1000 times larger&#xD;
      than that of bacteria. Thus, the first limiting step for clinical metagenomics is the need to&#xD;
      obtain sufficient bacterial DNA to allow the preparation of quality libraries for sequencing,&#xD;
      but also to reduce the concentration of human DNA whose sequencing is unnecessary in this&#xD;
      context . Methods are available but their evaluation for clinical metagenomics purposes is&#xD;
      necessary. Secondly, the complexity of the bioinformatics data to be managed by a&#xD;
      microbiologist requires that data be exploited as automated as possible together with a&#xD;
      user-friendly interface, which is not the case today even if online platforms are being&#xD;
      developed. The taxonomic assignment of sequences, their assembly, the identification of genes&#xD;
      and chromosomal mutations associated with antibiotic resistance, and the establishment of a&#xD;
      link between the resistance determinant and the host bacterium are additional obstacles to&#xD;
      the implementation of clinical metagenomics. Finally, if the time taken to obtain results&#xD;
      that can be exploited by the microbiologist tends to decrease, it is now comparable to that&#xD;
      of culture, at a much higher cost. However, sustained competition between sequencer&#xD;
      manufacturers should maintain their decline as has been the case over the last decade.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Relevance of the use of clinical metagenomics in IE&#xD;
&#xD;
      The use of clinical metagenomics in the context of IE therefore seems relevant for several&#xD;
      reasons:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Most IE are monomicrobial, which support the good performance of clinical metagenomics&#xD;
           according to our preliminary results.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The culture of intraoperative samples performed in an IE context is sometimes negative,&#xD;
           due to antibiotic pre-treatment and / or non-cultivation under the routine conditions of&#xD;
           the pathogen (eg Bartonella spp or Coxiella spp.), leaving room for improvement.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The treatment of IE is a long-term treatment that requires accurate diagnosis in&#xD;
           accordance with pathogens' susceptibility to antibiotics. If the pathogen is not found&#xD;
           in culture, broad spectrum antibiotics should be administered to the patient with a&#xD;
           double risk of treatment failure and toxicity. However, clinical metagenomics could&#xD;
           provide information on antibiotic sensitivity even in the case of a negative culture.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In most cases, the microbiological diagnosis of IE is not an emergency diagnosis, which&#xD;
           is compatible with the use of clinical metagenomics for which the time of implementation&#xD;
           is at best 48-72h.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hence, we propose to assess the performance of clinical metagenomics in the diagnostic of IE.&#xD;
