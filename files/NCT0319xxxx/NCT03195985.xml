  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study will focus on measuring stress, rumination and cognitive function across three time&#xD;
      points in old adults with subjective cognitive complaints via a 4-week short mindfulness&#xD;
      intervention, as compare to an active control condition (psycho-education course &quot;ge Well&quot;).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a pilot study.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      20 old adults with subjective cognitive complaints will be recruited from adult day centres&#xD;
      and the Chelsea Westminster Hospital in London. All patients will be aged 65 and above. Each&#xD;
      participant will be randomly allocated to either a mindfulness intervention or the active&#xD;
      control condition (psychoeducation) with 10 participants in each intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A short mindfulness intervention of 4 weeks will be delivered by a trained mindfulness&#xD;
      teacher across four 2 hour sessions that focus on the breath, links between mind and body,&#xD;
      sensory and metacognitive awareness, emotion regulation, movement and compassion using&#xD;
      visually engaging materials that will enhance understanding, encoding and recollection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There will be one session per week. The proposed study will evaluate the effects of a short&#xD;
      mindfulness intervention in old adults with subjective cognitive complaints. Management of&#xD;
      emotional difficulties associated with anxiety and stress can improve psychological&#xD;
      well-being in sufferers, and in turn can enhance cognitive capacity to maximise function.&#xD;
      Mindfulness interventions are gentle, non-invasive and cost effective techniques that have&#xD;
      been designed for stress reduction, that have been associated with improvements in mood,&#xD;
      stress, pain management and overall well-being in a range of clinical and healthy&#xD;
      populations. In addition mindfulness interventions have also been shown to improve cognitive&#xD;
      function and emotion regulation by enhancing attentional awareness, attentional flexibility&#xD;
      and attentional capacity. However, very few studies to date focus on elderly participants and&#xD;
      no study to date has tried to shorten the current 8-week Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction&#xD;
      training in older adult populations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The psycho-education course will also take 4 consecutive weeks, with one session each week.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will be screened (see Appendix 6 of protocol) prior to the beginning of the&#xD;
      study and recruited if they fulfil the criteria required as highlighted within the&#xD;
      'participants' section. The screening session will take approximately 20minutes. Written&#xD;
      informed consent will be obtained from the participant prior to performing any study related&#xD;
      evaluations or procedures. Informed consent (see Appendix 4 of protocol) will be taken during&#xD;
      all assessment sessions and also during the screening assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be provided with written information about the study in the form of a&#xD;
      participant information sheet (see Appendix 3 of protocol) and mindfulness course leaflet,&#xD;
      and will be allowed a minimum of 24 hours for questions and to consider the study before&#xD;
      agreeing to participate. It will be the responsibility of the investigator or co-investigator&#xD;
      to obtain written informed consent prior to undertaking any questionnaires, tests, or hair&#xD;
      sampling detailed within the protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Mini-Mental State Examination and the National Adult Reading Task will be performed&#xD;
      during a screening session only. All other assessments (cognitive, psychological and&#xD;
      physiological) will be done at baseline, pre- intervention (week 4), and at a follow-up (week&#xD;
      8).&#xD;
&#xD;
      All assessments done during baseline, week 4, and week 8 assessment sessions will take&#xD;
      approximately 45minutes per session. Each assessment session will follow the same order in&#xD;
      which questionnaires and tasks are presented to participant (see Appendix 5 of protocol).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physiological assessment: Hair cortisol will be sampled from each participant during the&#xD;
      three assessment stages (baseline, week 4, and 8) by obtaining hair samples from&#xD;
      participant's vertex posterior. Each sample will be approximately 0.5cm in diameter, and will&#xD;
      be used for analysis carried out by Stratech (formerly Salimetrics) whereby 10% of the sample&#xD;
      will be extracted in duplicate and the remaining 90% of extractions will be performed in&#xD;
      singlet. Individually wrapped hair samples will be stored at a temperature between 20 and 25&#xD;
      degrees Celsius in a breathable container. The sampling should take approximately 5 minutes&#xD;
      for each participant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following hair sampling equipment is not included by Stratech and will need to be&#xD;
      provided by the researcher: thread for tying hair samples, sharp scissors, hair clips, a&#xD;
      pin-tailed comb, aluminium foil, large paper envelopes for long-term storage, and jiffy bags&#xD;
      for shipping.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cognitive Assessment: The cognitive domain will be assessed based on the Trail Making Task&#xD;
      (TMT) at three time points (baseline, week 4, and 8) and will provide information on&#xD;
      executive function, and also based on the Verbal Fluency Tasks to assess verbal fluency and&#xD;
      executive function. The Everyday Memory Questionnaire (EMQ) will be used to assess subjective&#xD;
      memory function at the three time points (baseline, week 4, and 8). The Verbal Fluency Tasks&#xD;
      will consist of the FAS phonemic fluency task and the Animal Naming Task (semantic fluency).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Psychological Assessment: The psychological domain will be assessed based on the Perceived&#xD;
      Stress Scale (PSS) which will provide information on the subjective stress levels of&#xD;
      participants, and also based on the Penn State Worry Questionnaire - Abbreviated (PSWQ-A)&#xD;
      which will provide information on the amount of worry each participant feels, and also the&#xD;
      Rumination Response Scale (RRS) which will provide information regarding the effect of&#xD;
      mindful exercises on ruminative behaviours. These will all be assessed at the three&#xD;
      assessment points (baseline, week 4, and 8).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Please note all questionnaires and tasks involved are validated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All questionnaires and tasks will be administered in paper form in the presence of a member&#xD;
      of the research team trained at administering the tasks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Mindfulness course:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A short mindfulness course will be delivered by a trained mindfulness teacher and Clinical&#xD;
      Psychologist across four 2-hour sessions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The course will be accompanied by a booklet designed by Edginton and Nenadlova (in prep)&#xD;
      highlighting the main themes within each session using visually engaging pictures to help&#xD;
      enhance understanding, encoding and recollection (see appendix 1 of protocol).&#xD;
&#xD;
      There will be one session per week for 4 consecutive weeks, at the same time each week. The&#xD;
      details of each session are described below:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Week 1:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Introduction to the topic. Guided mindful eating. Focus on being 'in the moment' and&#xD;
      appreciating the task the participant doing at each point in time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mindful eating will take form via eating a raisin - studying the raisin in detail (colour,&#xD;
      sensations such as smell and texture) and focusing in detail on the process involved in&#xD;
      eating the raisin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this session will be to teach participants to focus on each task that they are&#xD;
      doing in detail, with the goal to be able to give full attention to each task, without&#xD;
      thinking about the next task.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Homework given in the form of a practice exercise.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Week 2:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recap of the previous week's topic. Guided mindful breathing exercise, focus on the breath&#xD;
      and being 'in the moment'.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Guided mindful body-scan. Focus on different parts of the body and its sensations via a&#xD;
      guided body scan exercise.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Emphasis on observing sensations rather than judging sensations. Focus on being 'in the&#xD;
      moment', focusing at one thing at a time, and also training the ability to focus attention&#xD;
      and awareness to different parts of the body at will.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Homework given in the form of a practice exercise.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Week 3:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recap of the previous week's topic. Guided session mindful coping and dealing with&#xD;
      difficulties. The aim of the session will be to become mindfully aware of whatever is most&#xD;
      predominant in the participant's moment by moment experience, and for participants to uncover&#xD;
      how they are relating to feelings and thoughts are arising, and approach them in an accepting&#xD;
      way.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exercise practiced during the session: The Three Step Breathing Space - creating an imaginary&#xD;
      space around ourselves by imaging our breath expanding beyond our body into the space around&#xD;
      us.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Homework given in the form of a practice exercise.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Week 4:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recap of the previous week's topic. Guided session on mindful choices and looking after own&#xD;
      self. Exercises involve (a) focusing on what the participant finds nourishing and depleting&#xD;
      in their daily activities and (b) a guided Mountain exercise whereby participants imagine&#xD;
      themselves as being a mountain which stands tall despite the ever-changing environment around&#xD;
      them. Recap of topics covered will be included at the end, and suggestion for how to continue&#xD;
      the practice beyond the course will be provided.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The delivery of the mindfulness intervention will be designed for independent groups of up to&#xD;
      10 participants within one class.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The active control condition:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The active control condition will be identical in length to the mindfulness course. It will&#xD;
      consist of 4 &quot;Age Well&quot; psycho-education sessions. These sessions will aim to provide&#xD;
      individuals with knowledge about general well-being such as healthy movement and activity,&#xD;
      healthy eating, and the importance of cognitive stimulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These sessions will run in parallel to the mindfulness course, and will be run by the&#xD;
      Clinical Psychologist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be asked to write their name onto an attendance sheet during both&#xD;
      Mindfulness and &quot;Age Well&quot; sessions to track participant attendance throughout the courses&#xD;
      (Appendix 2 of protocol).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Please note that the screening and assessment visits may take place within +/- 7 days based&#xD;
      on the discretion of the Chief Investigator. Date of each assessment visit will be recorded&#xD;
      on the informed consent form which will be signed at each assessment visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research is being funded by the Imperial College Alzheimer's Network, London.&#xD;
