      The purpose of this research study is to evaluate contrast-enhanced ultrasound for kidney&#xD;
      malignancies.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an investigator-initiated, prospective study designed to evaluate the accuracy of&#xD;
      contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) with microbubble contrast agent (perflutren lipid;&#xD;
      Definity®) to identify malignancy in patients with kidney disease, a known risk factor for&#xD;
      kidney malignancy, in whom a conventional ultrasound (US) or other prior imaging shows an&#xD;
      indeterminate or suspicious kidney lesion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of the study is to estimate the sensitivity of CEUS in diagnosing&#xD;
      kidney malignancy in patients with a risk factor for kidney malignancy and compare it to the&#xD;
      current gold standard test in this patient population. Secondary analysis will include more&#xD;
      optimal contrast-enhanced imaging with computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging&#xD;
      (MRI) in a subset of patients who can receive these studies. The study outcome will lead to&#xD;
      immediate clinical application in patients with chronic kidney disease. Given the&#xD;
      cost-effectiveness and adverse event profile, it has excellent potential to become&#xD;
      established as first line diagnostics in the general patient population as well.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        To be eligible for the present study, patients must meet the following criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Able to provide written informed consent&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Willing to comply with protocol requirements&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. At least 18 years of age&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Have kidney disease, defined as either chronic kidney disease (CKD) II-V, determined&#xD;
             by estimated glomerular filtration rate (GFR) of &lt;90 and derived from serum creatinine&#xD;
             measurements, or albuminuria/proteinuria, determined by albumin to creatinine ratio or&#xD;
             protein to creatinine ratio of &gt;30mg/gm within 3 months of recruitment, or on dialysis&#xD;
             or having received a kidney transplant or have biopsy proven kidney disease. In these&#xD;

Perflutren Lipid microsphere: Perflutren will be administered in a bolus or continuous infusion using the dosing range and administration type within the perflutren prescribing information.Once perflutren lipid has been administered, the transducer is maintained in a constant position over the area of interest to show the target lesion in order to assess the enhancement pattern during the early, mid and late vascular phases. Images will also be taken of kidney parenchyma in a suitable longitudinal plane.If there are multiple lesions in one subject requiring a second dose, the subject will have the option to undergo a 2nd contrast-enhanced study 30-minutes after the initial contrast dose, per dosing instructions in the package insert.</description>
