      To demonstrate a reduction of debris in knee synovial fluid as demonstrated by WBC cell&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will demonstrate a reduction in fluid cell counts in aspirate acquired from&#xD;
      primary total knee arthroplasty patients diagnosed with infection. WBC cell counts will be&#xD;
      compared before and after articular irrigation with Bactisure Wound Lavage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is a prospective, multi-center, single arm study involving orthopedic surgeons&#xD;
      skilled and experienced in deep surgical debridement and in I &amp; D or reoperation (revision)&#xD;
      total knee arthroplasty procedures. A maximum of seven study centers will enroll a maximum of&#xD;
      40 subjects.&#xD;
