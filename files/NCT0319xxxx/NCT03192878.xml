  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Takayasu arteritis (TA) is a chronic inflammatory disease affecting large and medium caliber&#xD;
      arteries, particularly the aortic arch and its main branches. Clinical manifestations are&#xD;
      caused by the marked thickening of the wall of the involved vessels, resulting in lumen&#xD;
      narrowing and ischemia of the tributary districts. Therapy is based on the use of&#xD;
      corticosteroids, immunosuppressants, and biologic drugs including infliximab, a monoclonal&#xD;
      antibody blocking tissue necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha. Biosimilar infliximab is commercially&#xD;
      available and used in the treatment of various immune-mediated conditions. There are&#xD;
      currently no data on the efficacy and safety of biosimilar infliximab in the treatment of TA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators propose this monocentric, observational, prospective, open label study to&#xD;
      evaluate the efficacy and safety of biosimilar infliximab in the treatment of 30 patients&#xD;
      with TA. Specifically, the study will include: I) TA patients refractory to treatment with&#xD;
      corticosteroid and/or immmunosuppressive therapy, not previously treated with infliximab; II)&#xD;
      TA patients already receiving treatment with originator infliximab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Biosimilar infliximab will be administered at dosages usually employed in the treatment of&#xD;
      TA. Specifically, patients not previously treated with the originator drug will receive&#xD;
      biosimilar infliximab intravenously at a dose of 5 mg/Kg at time 0, at week 2, at week 4;&#xD;
      thereafter, treatment will be administered every 4-6 weeks at a dose of 5-10 mg/kg based on&#xD;
      clinical judgement. In patients previously treated with the originator drug, biosimilar&#xD;
      infliximab will be administered at the same dosages.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To evaluate the efficacy of therapy, changes in clinical manifestations, laboratory&#xD;
      examinations, and imaging findings including angio-magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of&#xD;
      thoracic and abdominal vessels and total body PET/CT scan will be evaluate at time 0 as well&#xD;
      as 6 and 12 months following treatment initiation. In order to evaluate the safety of the&#xD;
      study treatment, the investigators will stringently evaluate possible side effects of&#xD;
      treatment, including infusion reactions, changes in laboratory tests, infection, cancer,&#xD;
      autoimmune manifestations, neurological and cardiovascular symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The total duration of follow up for each patient will be 52 weeks from enrolment.&#xD;
