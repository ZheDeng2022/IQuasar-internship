  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This trial is conducted in Asia, Europe and the United States of America (USA). The aim of&#xD;
      the trial is to assess the efficacy of concizumab administered s.c. (subcutaneously, under&#xD;
      the skin) once daily in preventing bleeding episodes in patients with severe haemophilia A&#xD;
      without inhibitors.&#xD;

    <participant_flow>
      <recruitment_details>The trial was conducted at 26 sites in 11 countries as follows: France (3), Germany (2), Italy (1), Japan (3), Spain (3), Sweden (2), Thailand (1), Turkey (3), the United Kingdom (4), Ukraine (1) and the United States (3). In addition to these sites, 5 sites were approved by the IRB/IEC and/or local health authority but did not screen or assign any participants to treatment.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>The trial consisted of two treatment periods: main part which lasted at least 24 weeks for all participants in the trial and an extension part which was up to 102 weeks.</pre_assignment_details>

          <description>Participants received subcutaneous (s.c.) injection of concizumab once daily for up to 126 weeks (at least 24 weeks main part + 52-102 weeks extension part). The initial dose was 0.15 milligrams per kilogram (mg/kg) and then the dose was escalated to 0.20 and 0.25 mg/kg based on the number of spontaneous bleeding episodes. Participants continued the extension phase at the same dose of concizumab once daily they have reached at the end of main part for 52-102 weeks with the potential dose escalation based on the number of spontaneous bleeding episodes.</description>

Breakthrough bleeding episodes occurring to the participants during the trial were treated with turoctocog at home.</description>
