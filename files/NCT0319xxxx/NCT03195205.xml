  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Approximately 3.5 - 5 million Americans are living with hepatitis C virus (HCV) in the United&#xD;
      States. HCV significantly impacts rural Pennsylvania. It is estimated that 160,000 adults in&#xD;
      Pennsylvania are living with hepatitis C. In 2010, Center for Rural Pennsylvania estimated&#xD;
      that 27% of population of PA live in one of Pennsylvania's 48 rural counties. Under this&#xD;
      estimate, there are over 43,000 individuals affected with chronic HCV living in rural&#xD;
      Pennsylvania. Rural county residents often experience barriers to health care by having fewer&#xD;
      primary care providers and limited specialty care physicians available to them to address&#xD;
      their healthcare needs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RQ1: Will the community based delivery system for Hepatitis C screenings see an increase in&#xD;
      positivity rates?&#xD;
&#xD;
      HO1: There is no relationship between the community based delivery system with an increase in&#xD;
      the Hepatitis C screening positivity rates.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HA1: There is a relationship between the community based delivery system with an increase in&#xD;
      the Hepatitis C screening positivity rates.&#xD;

      In rural Pennsylvania, transportation is considered a socioeconomic barrier and social&#xD;
      detriment to personal health. Using an evidence-based model of population health by bringing&#xD;
      the care into the high-risk population's community setting reduces the transportation and&#xD;
      socioeconomic barriers of the most vulnerable at risk populations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is estimated that 35% to 65% of Opioid Substitution Treatment Patients (OST), are infected&#xD;
      with HCV. Therefore, OPT programs that are already operating will be engaged and will be a&#xD;
      primary focus for patient screening and recruitment for these services. In addition, high&#xD;
      volume venues attracting high-risk populations will also be targeted to encourage HCV&#xD;
      screening, education, and treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To screen Opioid Substitution Treatment Patients (OST), high-risk individual at Opioid&#xD;
      Treatment Programs (OTP), and/or all high-risk populations in outlying sites (Anti-HCV&#xD;
      prevalence)&#xD;
&#xD;
      To initiate HCV treatment of OST patients and other high-risk individuals at OTP facilities&#xD;
      and/or high risk populations in outlying sites (linkage of care)&#xD;
&#xD;
      To maintain the successful HCV therapy and cure [Sustained Viral Response (SVR)] in OST&#xD;
      patients and other high-risk individuals at OPT facility and/or high risk populations in&#xD;
      outlying sites (retention)&#xD;
&#xD;
      To facilitate the use of a patient navigator and nursing case management staff to reduce&#xD;
      barriers to initial screening and patient education&#xD;
