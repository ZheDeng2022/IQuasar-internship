      Open-label, single-arm, multi-center, Phase IIa study to evaluate the efficacy, safety, and&#xD;
      immunological response of OBP 301 in patients with unresectable/unresected metastatic&#xD;
      melanoma. This proof of concept study will be undertaken in male and female patients with&#xD;
      unresectable Stage III and IV melanoma. Patients with unresectable/unresected mucosal&#xD;
      melanoma may be enrolled after consultation with the Medical Monitor.&#xD;

      Primary Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the overall tumor sites response&#xD;
      (objective response rate [ORR]) to OBP-301 in both injected and noninjected lesions up to and&#xD;
      including Week 24 in patients with unresectable/unresected Stage III and IV melanoma. The ORR&#xD;
      is defined as the rate of complete response (CR) and partial response (PR) based on the&#xD;
      modified immune-related response criteria (irRC) 1.0. The modification is to allow the&#xD;
      identification of up to 10 cutaneous, subcutaneous, and/or lymph node tumor lesions and&#xD;
      identify the lesions as target and nontarget lesions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the ORR up to and including Week 24 in injected target lesions based on the&#xD;
           modified irRC 1.0 and Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the ORR up to and including Week 24 in noninjected target lesions based on&#xD;
           modified irRC 1.0 and RECIST 1.1&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the ORR in both injected and noninjected target lesions at Week 12 based on&#xD;
           the modified irRC 1.0 and RECIST 1.1&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate duration of response and time to response&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate progression free survival (PFS) at Week 24 and Week 48&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate overall survival (OS) at Week 24 and Week 48&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the safety of OBP 301&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exploratory Objective (optional):&#xD;
&#xD;
      The optional exploratory objective of this study is to investigate the tumor immunological&#xD;
      response in blood and tumor tissue following treatment with OBP-301.&#xD;
