  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic kidney disease (CKD), affects over 45% of all individuals over 70 years of age.&#xD;
      Patients with moderate CKD have more than a two-fold increased risk of cognitive impairment&#xD;
      than those without CKD; furthermore, as many as 20-70% of patients with CKD have established&#xD;
      cognitive impairment and overt dementia. The burden of cognitive impairment and dementia&#xD;
      leads to functional decline and accelerated loss of independence, contributing to the&#xD;
      tremendous individual, societal, and economic burden of CKD (i.e., 20% of Medicare&#xD;
      expenditures in adults &gt;65 years of age). There is no recommended treatment to prevent&#xD;
      cognitive decline in CKD patients, and the few medications available for cognitive impairment&#xD;
      have only short term modest effects. There is a critical need to evaluate therapies to&#xD;
      forestall cognitive impairment, and maintain or improve cognitive functioning in older&#xD;
      patients with CKD. To address this need, this study will test the hypothesis that older&#xD;
      patients with moderate/severe CKD and pre-clinical cognitive impairment randomized to a&#xD;
      6-month home-based exercise program will improve cognitive function and MRI measured brain&#xD;
      structure, compared to a usual care control group. This study will combine an assessment of&#xD;
      cognition with MR imaging techniques to fully evaluate brain structure, blood flow, and&#xD;
      behavior relationships at a level previously not conducted in this population&#xD;

A composite global cognitive score was created by converting the individual cognitive scores to standardized z scores and then averaging the standardized z scores. An increase in change from baseline to 6 months is considered an improvement.</description>
