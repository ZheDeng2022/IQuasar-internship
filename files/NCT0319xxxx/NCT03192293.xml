  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective single arm open-label Phase 2 study utilising the combination of&#xD;
      Fulvestrant, Metformin and Simvastatin in post-menopausal ER-positive metastatic breast&#xD;
      cancer, with the primary endpoint being Clinical Benefit Rate (defined as complete response,&#xD;
      partial response or stable disease, equal to or more than 24 weeks). The hypothesis is that&#xD;
      the addition of Metformin and Simvastatin to Fulvestrant will improve the Clinical Benefit&#xD;
      Rate from 40% (historical data from control arm of PALOMA-3 study) to 60%. A total of 28&#xD;
      patients will be enrolled over a period of 24 months. Eligible patients will receive 500 mg&#xD;
      Fulvestrant by intramuscular injection on days 1 and 15 of cycle one and then on day one of&#xD;
      each subsequent cycle (28 days). Patients will be given 850mg oral Metformin twice-a-day&#xD;
      (based on xenograft models which showed that Metformin had anti-tumor effects at a minimum&#xD;
      dose of 1500mg per day), and 20mg oral Simvastatin every night (drawing reference from the&#xD;
      investigators' group's window-of-opportunity study), daily throughout the cycle. As part of&#xD;
      the in-build safety and tolerability design, all patients will have a lead-in period of 7&#xD;
      days where they receive 850mg oral Metformin twice-a-day and 20mg oral Simvastatin every&#xD;
      night. Special adverse events of interest include lactic acidosis, diarrhea, bloatedness,&#xD;
      transaminitis and rhabdomyolysis. If no dose-limiting toxic effects (DLT) occur, Fulvestrant&#xD;
      will be commenced, and considered the start of cycle 1. If DLT occurs in any of the patients,&#xD;
      the combination of Metformin and Simvastatin will be modified for the affected patient as per&#xD;
      protocol, with further monitoring for another 7 days. This combination will be deemed safe&#xD;
      for that patient if no DLT occurs, following which cycle 1 can officially commence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the time of study entry, blood samples will be drawn to establish baseline physiological&#xD;
      parameters including fasting insulin, glucose, lipids and Homeostasis Model Assessment 2&#xD;
      (HOMA2). In patients who have accessible tumor sites and are willing to provide tissue for&#xD;
      translational research, pre- and post-treatment (at end of 8 weeks) biopsies will be taken&#xD;
      for correlative biomarker studies. Patients will be evaluated on an 8-weekly basis for&#xD;
      toxicities and efficacy assessments during the first 6 months of treatment, followed by&#xD;
      12-weekly thereafter until disease progression, unacceptable toxicities, or patient&#xD;
      withdrawal.&#xD;

      Endocrine therapy and acquired endocrine resistance in advanced breast cancer:&#xD;
&#xD;
      First-line treatment of metastatic estrogen receptor (ER) positive breast cancer with&#xD;
      endocrine therapy such as Tamoxifen or aromatase inhibitors (AI) is efficacious, but&#xD;
      development of secondary resistance is inevitable with median progression free survival of 9&#xD;
      months.1 Acquired resistance can be contributed by molecular cross-talk between estrogen&#xD;
      receptors and other key survival and proliferative pathways. In particular, the PI3K/Akt/MAP&#xD;
      kinase signaling pathway is upregulated with prolonged estrogen deprivation and is an&#xD;
      important feature of progressive disease biology.2&#xD;
&#xD;
      The BOLERO-2 study showed an improvement in response rates and progression free survival with&#xD;
      the addition of Everolimus, an mTOR-inhibitor to Exemestane in metastatic ER-positive breast&#xD;
      cancer after failure on a non-steroidal AI.3 Synergy was also seen in a Phase 2 clinical&#xD;
      trial with the combination of Fulvestrant and Everolimus in the second line setting.4&#xD;
      However, the clinical experience with Everolimus has been poor, with frequent adverse effects&#xD;
      rendering the combination with endocrine therapy highly toxic. More recently, the PALOMA-1/3&#xD;
      studies have showed that targeting the CDK4/CDK6/E2F axis with Palbociclib is a feasible&#xD;
      strategy with marked improvements in clinical endpoints when combined with Letrozole in the&#xD;
      first line, and Fulvestrant after AI-failure.5,6 While the therapy was reasonably&#xD;
      well-tolerated, Palbociclib remains prohibitively expensive, and is not widely used in&#xD;
      countries where healthcare systems do not cover the cost of this novel combination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Potential of Metformin and Simvastatin as anti-cancer agents:&#xD;
&#xD;
      It has been widely recognized that Metformin and Simvastatin, both commonly used medications&#xD;
      in diabetes mellitus and dyslipidemia, have anti-cancer properties. Years of experience in&#xD;
      the real world have shown that at standard doses, these 2 drugs can be used in combination&#xD;
      with little toxicities. Metformin, a biguanide, results in activation of AMPK which&#xD;
      consequently inhibits mTOR through phosphorylation of TSC2, as well as anti-proliferative&#xD;
      effects through reduction in insulin receptor mediated mitogenesis and inhibition of cyclin&#xD;
      dependent kinases.7,8 Pre-clinical studies in mouse xenograft models showed that at an&#xD;
      equivalent dose of at least 1500mg per day, Metformin reduced the effective dosage of&#xD;
      standard chemotherapeutic agents, and had preferential effects on tumor cells.9 Studies of&#xD;
      Metformin in MCF7, an ER-positive breast cancer cell line, also showed that it resulted in&#xD;
      significant reduction in protein synthesis as well as inhibition of the mTOR pathway.10&#xD;
      Simvastatin, a lipophilic HMGCoA reductase inhibitor, has been shown to interrupt oncogenic&#xD;
      signaling by prenylation-dependent proteins including the RAS oncogene family, and attenuate&#xD;
      PI3K signaling. In a recent window-of-opportunity study by the inverstigators' group, the&#xD;
      investigators showed that at the usual prescribed dose of Simvastatin (20mg), a short course&#xD;
      of therapy resulted in evident apoptosis and de-activation of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR and MAPK/ERK&#xD;
      pathways in both clinical specimens as well as breast cancer cell lines.12&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators believe that there is untapped potential in the usage of Metformin and&#xD;
      Simvastatin in targeting the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway which is upregulated in metastatic&#xD;
      ER-positive breast cancer after progression on first-line endocrine therapy, and that this&#xD;
      inexpensive and non-toxic combination will show synergy with Fulvestrant in the second-line&#xD;
      (and beyond) setting.&#xD;
