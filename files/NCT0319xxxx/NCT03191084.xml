  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Marijuana is one of the most widely used substances. This study will characterize the&#xD;
      persistence of cannabis' (CNB's) acute effects on cognitive test performance and simulated&#xD;
      driving over a several hour time period. The data obtained from simulated driving, cognitive&#xD;
      tests, and biological assays of THC will be used in analyses aimed at identifying what tests&#xD;
      or combination of tests predict both recent use and driving impairment risk.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible participants will undergo a full day screening visit, if still eligible they will&#xD;
      come to Hartford Hospital in Hartford, Connecticut to take part in the full study.&#xD;
      Participation requires overnight stays between each of the five study visits. On each of the&#xD;
      study days participants are dosed with either a low dose of THC marijuana, a high dose of THC&#xD;
      marijuana or placebo marijuana, (the low and high doses are repeated once each, order in&#xD;
      which the study drug is given is double blind and chosen at random.)&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This responds to NHTSA's request with a proposal to increase our understanding of smoked&#xD;
      cannabis' (CNB's) acute effects on cognition and simulated driving performance, the&#xD;
      persistence of these deficits over the hours after use, and the influence of prior experience&#xD;
      with CNB on these effects. The project also will link an extensive literature on CNB's&#xD;
      effects on laboratory cognitive tests to simulated driving performance for the first time,&#xD;
      providing a crucial validation of CNB's neurofunctional effects identifying maximally&#xD;
      relevant candidate measures for field sobriety tests. To this goal, the proposed study was&#xD;
      based upon a careful and thorough review of the scientific literature describing CNB effects&#xD;
      on cognitive test performance and driving, as well as current state-of-knowledge on the&#xD;
      sensitivity of biological assays for identifying recent CNB use. The study will carefully&#xD;
      characterize the persistence of CNB's acute effects on cognitive test performance and driving&#xD;
      over a several-hour time span. This will allow us to identify the point at which any effects&#xD;
      of CNB intoxication on cognitive tests and driving performance cannot be distinguished from&#xD;
      normal, i.e., the first step towards establishing standards for legal and social policy. The&#xD;
      data obtained from simulated driving, cognitive tests, and biological assays of THC will be&#xD;
      used in analyses aimed at identifying what tests or combination of tests predict both recent&#xD;
      use and driving impairment risk.&#xD;
