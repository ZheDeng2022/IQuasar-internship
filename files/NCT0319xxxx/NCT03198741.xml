      Long-term DAPT is recommended after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) in patients with&#xD;
      coronary artery disease. However, antiplatelet therapy may have adverse consequences, the&#xD;
      most common of which is gastrointestinal mucosal injury with ulceration and bleeding. The&#xD;
      extent to which an an abbreviated DAPT strategy reduces gastrointestinal mucosal injury has&#xD;
      not been studied, principally due to the lack of sensitive, noninvasive measurements capable&#xD;

      is a non-invasive, active controlled system which affords assessment of the stomach and&#xD;
      entire small intestine.The current randomized study will assess gastrointestinal mucosal&#xD;
      injury and bleeding via AMCE in patients on three different antiplatelet regimens and&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) with aspirin and a platelet P2Y12 receptor inhibitor has&#xD;
      become the cornerstone for secondary prevention of coronary artery disease. Long-term DAPT is&#xD;
      recommended after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) in patients with coronary artery&#xD;
      disease to prevent future thrombotic events arising from the stent or untreated coronary&#xD;
      lesions. However, antiplatelet therapy may have adverse consequences, the most common of&#xD;
      which is gastrointestinal mucosal injury with ulceration and bleeding. The frequency of&#xD;
      gastrointestinal complications increases with the duration of DAPT. Studies in patients&#xD;
      treated with current generation drug-eluting stents have demonstrated that shortened DAPT&#xD;
      regimens reduce the risk of bleeding events with small ischemic risk. However, the optimal&#xD;
      duration of DAPT is still controversial. The extent to which an an abbreviated DAPT strategy&#xD;
      reduces gastrointestinal mucosal injury has not been studied, principally due to the lack of&#xD;
      sensitive, noninvasive measurements capable of detecting gastrointestinal injury.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Endoscopic examination of the gastric mucosa (gastroscopy) has high sensitivity and accuracy&#xD;
      to detect gastrointestinal injury and bleeding. However, endoscopy is invasive and thus has&#xD;
      no role in screening for sub-clinical gastrointestinal bleeding in patients undergoing PCI.&#xD;
      Rather, endoscopy examinations are reserved for patients with active bleeding to identify the&#xD;
      location of origin and etiology of the bleed. Moreover, gastroenterologists often refuse to&#xD;
      perform gastroscopy in patients on DAPT given the risk of iatrogenic trauma with excessive&#xD;
      hemorrhage. To minimize this risk, one or both antiplatelet agents often have to be&#xD;
      discontinued for several days prior to the procedure, delaying the diagnosis while increasing&#xD;
      the risk of stent thrombosis. Finally, upper endoscopy can only detect pathology related to&#xD;
      the stomach and duodenum, as it does not visualize the remainder of the small intestine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ANKON® magnetically controlled capsule endoscopy (AMCE) is a non-invasive, active controlled&#xD;
      system which affords assessment of the stomach and entire small intestine. In the AMCE&#xD;
      procedure, the patient swallows a capsule containing an endoscope which is actively&#xD;
      maneuvered via magnetic control in the stomach, and then passes through the gastrointestinal&#xD;
      track until its ultimate excretion. AMCE has several advantages compared to standard&#xD;
      endoscopy. AMCE is noninvasive, painless and convenient, and can be re-administered as&#xD;
      necessary. Patient acceptance of AMCE is likely to be substantially higher than standard&#xD;
      endoscopy as the procedure involves only swallowing a capsule endoscope, without anesthesia&#xD;
      or recovery time. Compared to standard endoscopy, AMCE provides more comprehensive detection&#xD;
      of gastrointestinal pathology as it visualizes not only the stomach and duodenum, but the&#xD;
      entire small intestine. Finally, discontinuation of antiplatelet drugs during AMCE is not&#xD;
      necessary. Because of these advantages, AMCE can be used for screening of gastrointestinal&#xD;
      mucosal lesions prior to clinical bleeding, including early detection of small areas of focal&#xD;
      and concealed bleeding. Detection of preclinical gastric ulcerations or bleeding may be&#xD;
      useful in directing preventative measures, whether gastro-protective therapies or DAPT&#xD;
      discontinuation. A large-scale, randomized trial has confirmed that the sensitivity and&#xD;
      specificity of AMCE for the detection of focal lesions of the gastrointestinal tract is&#xD;
      similar to standard endoscopy. However, the potential utility of AMCE in patients receiving&#xD;
      antiplatelet therapy after PCI has not been reported.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The current randomized study will evaluate AMCE as a tool to assess gastrointestinal mucosal&#xD;
      injury and bleeding in patients on DAPT; evaluate the relative rates of gastrointestinal&#xD;
      injury in patients on three different antiplatelet regimens; and establish a gastrointestinal&#xD;
      mucosal injury scoring system which may prove useful in guiding optimal antiplatelet agent&#xD;
      usage after PCI.&#xD;
