  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this project is to conduct a multicentre, randomized controlled trial (RCT)&#xD;
      with 250 patients diagnosed with an eating disorder (ED). In this experiment, the patients&#xD;
      from the experimental group will test an mHealth application (TCApp developed by HealthApp)&#xD;
      and then, a clinical efficacy analysis and economic evaluations will be performed. To do&#xD;
      this, we have set the following three specific objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the clinical efficacy of an intensive intervention that includes both&#xD;
           standard face-to-face Cognitive Behavioural Treatment (CBT) (treatment as usual, TAU)&#xD;
           plus an online intervention using TCApp, versus TAU alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To carry out an economic evaluation (cost-utility and cost-effectiveness analysis) of&#xD;
           the new mHealth intervention and identify factors that promote or hinder the&#xD;
           implementation of TCApp in mental health settings in Spain.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To analyse the adoption processes of this type of applications by patients and health&#xD;
           professionals and identify the determinants of mHealth adoption.&#xD;
&#xD;
      General hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The implementation of the intensive intervention program (TAU + TCApp) would result in a more&#xD;
      significant improvement of the ED symptoms compared to the TAU control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific hypotheses:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The application of the intensive mHealth intervention would lead to significantly&#xD;
           greater change scores (difference between T0 and T1) in the primary outcome variable of&#xD;
           ED psychopathology, compared to the control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The mHealth intervention would lead to significantly greater change scores (difference&#xD;
           between T0 and T1) in patients' secondary outcome variables: a) depression symptoms, b)&#xD;
           anxiety symptoms, c) motivation to change, d) suicidal risk, and e) quality of life,&#xD;
           compared to the control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Similarly, intensive intervention would result in greater change scores (difference&#xD;
           between T0 and T1) in caregivers' variables: a) quality of life and b) caregiver burden.&#xD;

      1. The TCApp application TCapp is a tool intended to connect patients and therapists in the&#xD;
           time between medical consultations. It is currently available on Google Play and Apple&#xD;
           Store markets, there are more than 412 patients who are currently using it and it was&#xD;
           developed in collaboration with different public and private mental health institutions&#xD;
           in the Barcelona area (Althaia, Hospital de Sant Rafael, CST, ITA and Hospital Sant Joan&#xD;
           de Déu). TCApp was designed from the start with therapists' and patients´ needs and&#xD;
           interests in mind. By using TCapp, patients and therapists are in continuous contact,&#xD;
           allowing for a quicker reaction from the therapist according to the patients' needs.&#xD;
&#xD;
           With TCApp, patients can record their thoughts, behaviors, emotions and whatever the&#xD;
           therapists consider relevant for the therapy, since the app can be customized according&#xD;
           to the therapy requirements of each specific patient. It involves algorithms based on&#xD;
           artificial intelligence that can generate alarms when strategic words (i.e. suicide,&#xD;
           death, etc.) are written. It also introduces technologies that allow for real-time&#xD;
           online contact with therapists and gamification aesthetics that include prizes, rewards&#xD;
           and reminders aimed at improving patients' engagement.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The BackOffice tool for therapists is a web-based platform where therapists can see in&#xD;
           real time what their patients have registered (i.e. generation of graphs in a period of&#xD;
           time to visualize parameter comparison and patient evolution) and they can interact in&#xD;
           real time with them by using PUSH notifications. The tool is integrated in Azure server&#xD;
           in order to ensure accordance with the most restrictive data protection laws and it is&#xD;
           prepared for for its integration in the local management systems of hospitals and&#xD;
           clinics. Finally, there is currently no application available to provide the same&#xD;
           services and benefits as TCapp as most of the available applications contain self-help&#xD;
           functionalities, rather than allowing for a bidirectional link between the patient and&#xD;
           the therapist.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Once TCApp has proven to be an efficient and effective tool for use in ED units of&#xD;
           public and private mental health services in Spain, the long-term contributions of the&#xD;
           current study are as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  To promote the clinical use of TCApp in ED units not only in Spain but also at an&#xD;
                international level.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Reduce the direct and indirect costs associated with the treatment of eating&#xD;
                disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Improve the quality of patient care and the treatment effectiveness for EDs (e.g.,&#xD;
                increase patients' adherence to treatment, prevent relapse) while reducing waiting&#xD;
                lists at various hospitals from Spain.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Explore the future export of the application to other mental disorders whose&#xD;
                treatment is also based on cognitive behavioural therapy, such as depression,&#xD;
                addictions and anxiety.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Work plan and duration of the project 2.1 Methods 2.1.1 Sample The total sample will&#xD;
           include approximately 250 patients with an ED diagnosis currently receiving treatment,&#xD;
           who will be recruited from different public and private mental health services in Spain&#xD;
           (Parc Taulí Hospital, Sant Joan de Déu Hospital, Dexeus University Hospital of the&#xD;
           Quirónsalud group in Barcelona, Sant Rafael Hospital, Servei Salut de les Illes Balears&#xD;
           and Infantil Universitario Niño Jesús de Madrid). All patients will receive standard CBT&#xD;
           treatment, which includes the support of a multidisciplinary team from the different ED&#xD;
           units (psychiatry, psychology, nutrition, nursing).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The a priori sample size calculation was based on results from previous studies that&#xD;
      implemented Internet-based programs in the treatment of EDs (Aardoom et al., 2013; Hötzel et&#xD;
      al., 2014; Ruwaard et al., 2013). A small between-group effect size (Cohen' s d = 0.40) is&#xD;
      expected. The calculation was conducted by the software program G*POWER. The primary analysis&#xD;
      will concern the hypothesis that the average level of eating pathology at post-intervention&#xD;
      in the control group, based on the EDE-Q scores, will be significantly higher than the&#xD;
      average levels of eating pathology in the experimental group. Assuming an alpha of 0.05 and a&#xD;
      power of 0.80 (β -1) in an independent samples one-way t-test, a minimum of 100 participants&#xD;
      would be required per study arm. Allowing for a dropout rate of 25% of study participants&#xD;
      from the baseline, 250 participants need to be recruited in total.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.1.2 Design and procedure We will follow a mixed-methods approach, combining quantitative&#xD;
      and qualitative methods, through a randomised controlled trial with an intensive intervention&#xD;
      (TAU + TCApp) and a TAU control condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      First, all material with information related to the study (research protocol, informed&#xD;
      consent, patient information sheet, Data Collection Logbook, safety- and privacy-related&#xD;
      issues concerning the TCApp application) will be submitted for approval to each one of the&#xD;
      Ethical Committees of the participating hospitals. It should be mentioned that the approval&#xD;
      of the Ethical Committee of the University leading the study (Universitat Oberta de&#xD;
      Catalunya) was obtained on February 21st, 2017.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be recruited after previous recommendation by one of the ED specialists&#xD;
      working at each centre. Specialists will do a preliminary screening taking into consideration&#xD;
      the inclusion and exclusion criteria in order to identify potential candidates for the study.&#xD;
      Interested individuals will be able to confirm their participation by notifying the ED&#xD;
      specialist who will be responsible for their treatment. Then, an informational letter and an&#xD;
      informed consent form will be delivered to them.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completing and signing the informed consent form (for patients under 18 years of age,&#xD;
      their parents will have to sign the informed consent), initial clinical interviews will be&#xD;
      conducted by psychologists or other collaborators working in the ED unit. All the&#xD;
      interviewers will be previously trained in administering the K-SADS-PL or SCID interview,&#xD;
      depending on the participant's age. The objective of these interviews is: a) to definitively&#xD;
      determine whether participants are eligible for the study according to the inclusion&#xD;
      criteria, b) to establish the diagnosis for each patient and c) to evaluate them for possible&#xD;
      comorbidities. At this time, sociodemographic and clinical data of each patient will also be&#xD;
      collected through a brief interview. Then, those who meet the inclusion criteria will be&#xD;
      invited to complete the baseline questionnaires for the study. During this baseline&#xD;
      evaluation (T0), questionnaires will be administered to patients, their informal caregivers&#xD;
      and the ED specialist responsible for the online monitoring of each patient. In addition,&#xD;
      telephone interviews will be conducted with the technical staff and the ED specialists.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of the baseline questionnaires, participants will be randomized to one of&#xD;
      the two study conditions (experimental and control group). Randomization will be carried out&#xD;
      by an independent researcher in blocks of 10 participants within each ED unit (50% of&#xD;
      patients from each block will be assigned to the experimental group and the other 50% to the&#xD;
      control group), using a random allocation program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After this, patients will be notified about the group they belong to during their next visit&#xD;
      to the ED unit. At this time, patients from the experimental group will be given oral and&#xD;
      written instructions about how to download and use TCApp. In turn, patients from the TAU&#xD;
      control group will be told that access to TCApp will be offered to them after a waiting&#xD;
      period of 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Then, each group of patients will receive the treatment that corresponds to them during a&#xD;
      period of 12 weeks. At the end of the 12-week treatment, patients from the experimental group&#xD;
      will stop using TCApp and the evaluation post-treatment (T1, 12 weeks later) will be carried&#xD;
      out and will include: a) a brief clinical interview (patients), b) questionnaires (patients,&#xD;
      informal caregivers, ED specialists); c) telephone interviews (technical staff, ED&#xD;
      specialists) and d) a focus groups with ED specialists of each institution who are interested&#xD;
      in participating as well as with patients of the experimental group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both intent-to-treat and completers analyses will be carried out. Intent-to-treat analysis&#xD;
      will include every participant who was randomly allocated to one of the study conditions,&#xD;
      that is to say, 250 patients. Whenever possible, we will try to collect follow-up data from&#xD;
      participants who have dropped out, in order to keep our dataset as complete as possible.&#xD;
      Baseline differences between completers and dropouts will be analysed using data from the&#xD;
      clinical interviews and the baseline questionnaires, and possible reasons for dropout will be&#xD;
      examined through interviews with ED specialists (T1).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A participant will be considered a completer if he/she has completed the initial clinical&#xD;
      interview as well as T0 and T1 evaluations. For participants from the experimental group to&#xD;
      be considered completers, they will have to have used TCApp at least 70% of the time&#xD;
      initially agreed upon before the start of the experiment (i.e., at least once a day during a&#xD;
      period of 12 weeks). Only data from completers will be used to determine the treatment effect&#xD;
      on the main outcome variable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.1.3 Study conditions The experimental group will receive the standard treatment based on&#xD;
      CBT principles that is offered by the different ED units in Spain, plus an online&#xD;
      intervention using TCApp for a period of 12 weeks. Only one ED specialist will be responsible&#xD;
      for the online monitoring of each patient. For the specific purposes of our study, this role&#xD;
      has been assigned to the nursing staff for most of the centres.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The TCApp application provides patients with a number of different functions, including daily&#xD;
      self-records of their thoughts, emotions and behaviors, a chat with their therapists and&#xD;
      motivational exercises. A TCApp online platform is also available for therapists for the&#xD;
      online monitoring of each patient. Here, therapists have the possibility to follow the&#xD;
      patient's daily self-records, generate personalized reports and graphs and communicate with&#xD;
      him/her via chat, based on the information that the patient has provided online.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During these 12 weeks, the patient should use TCApp at least once a day, completing at least&#xD;
      one self-record daily and/or contacting his/her therapist via chat when needed. The therapist&#xD;
      responsible for the online monitoring should, at least once a week, connect to the online&#xD;
      platform and perform the following actions: follow the patient's daily self-records, generate&#xD;
      personalized reports or graphs and communicate with him/her via chat. After a 12-week period,&#xD;
      patients from the experimental group and their therapists will stop using the TCApp&#xD;
      application (they will be discharged).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The TAU control group will receive the standard face-to-face CBT, offered by the different ED&#xD;
      units in Spain. Patients from the control group will be offered access to TCApp after a&#xD;
      6-month period.&#xD;
