    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies the side effects and how well pembrolizumab works in combination&#xD;
      with standard therapy in treating patients with glioblastoma. Immunotherapy with monoclonal&#xD;
      antibodies, such as pembrolizumab, may help the body's immune system attack the cancer, and&#xD;
      may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Drugs used in the&#xD;
      chemotherapy, such as temozolomide, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells,&#xD;
      either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from&#xD;
      spreading. Radiation therapy uses high energy beams to kill tumor cells and shrink tumors.&#xD;
      Giving pembrolizumab and standard therapy comprising of temozolomide and radiation therapy&#xD;
      may kill tumor cells.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To assess the safety and tolerability of pembrolizumab in combination with standard&#xD;
      therapy (surgery, external beam radiation therapy and temozolomide [TMZ] chemotherapy) in&#xD;
      patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). (Neoadjuvant [Group 1]) II. To&#xD;
      assess the 18 month overall survival rate of pembrolizumab in combination with standard&#xD;
      therapy (surgery, external beam radiation therapy and TMZ chemotherapy) in patients with&#xD;
      newly diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). (Adjuvant [Group 2])&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To assess adverse events (AE) and toxicity profile of pembrolizumab in combination with&#xD;
      standard therapy in patients with newly diagnosed GBM.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To assess time to progression in patients treated with pembrolizumab in combination with&#xD;
      standard therapy in patients with newly diagnosed GBM. (Adjuvant only) III. To assess&#xD;
      progression-free survival in patients treated with pembrolizumab in combination with standard&#xD;
      therapy in patients with newly diagnosed GBM. (Adjuvant only) IV. To assess time to treatment&#xD;
      failure in patients treated with pembrolizumab in combination with standard therapy in&#xD;
      patients with newly diagnosed GBM. (Adjuvant only)&#xD;
&#xD;
      CORRELATIVE RESEARCH OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To assess the tumor PD-1/PD-L1 expression and inflammatory microenvironment profile by&#xD;
      comparing PD-1/PD-L1 expression and T lymphocyte/monocytic infiltrates before and after&#xD;
      administration of pembrolizumab treatment. (Neoadjuvant only) II. To assess the peripheral&#xD;
      immunophenotype profile and GBM-associated antigen-specific T cell responses before and after&#xD;
      receiving pembrolizumab treatment in combination with standard therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: Patients are assigned to 1 of 2 groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      GROUP 1:&#xD;
&#xD;
      NEOADJUVANT (CYCLE 1): Patients receive pembrolizumab intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on&#xD;
      day 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SURGERY (CYCLE 2): Patients undergo standard of care surgery within days 4-7.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CONCURRENT (CYCLE 3): Starting 21-35 days after surgery, patients receive pembrolizumab IV&#xD;
      over 30 minutes on days 1, 22, and 43 and temozolomide orally (PO) daily on days 8-54.&#xD;
      Patients also undergo external beam radiation therapy every 5 days per week on days 8-54.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ADJUVANT (CYCLE 4-8): Within 3-5 weeks after completing radiation therapy, patients receive&#xD;
      pembrolizumab IV over 30 minutes on days 1, 22, and 43 and temozolomide PO daily on days 1-5&#xD;
      every 28 days. Treatment repeats every 63 days for up to 5 cycles in the absence of disease&#xD;
      progression or unexpected toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      GROUP 2:&#xD;
&#xD;
      CONCURRENT (CYCLE 1): Starting 21-35 days after surgery, patients receive pembrolizumab IV&#xD;
      over 30 minutes on days 1, 22, and 43 and temozolomide PO daily on days 8-54. Patients also&#xD;
      undergo external beam radiation therapy every 5 days per week on days 8-54.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ADJUVANT (CYCLES 2-6): Within 3-5 weeks after completing radiation therapy, patients receive&#xD;
      pembrolizumab IV over 30 minutes on days 1, 22, and 43 of cycles 2-5 and 1 and 22 of cycle 6&#xD;
      (up to a total of 17 doses). Patients also receive temozolomide PO daily on days 1-5, 29-33,&#xD;
      and 57-61 of cycles 2 and 6, days 22-26 and 50-54 of cycle 3, days 15-19 and 43-47 of cycle&#xD;
      4, days 8-12 and 36-40 of cycle 5. Treatment repeats every 63 days for up to 5 cycles in the&#xD;
      absence of disease progression or unexpected toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days, every 3 months&#xD;
      until progressive disease, then every 6 months for up to 5 years.&#xD;
