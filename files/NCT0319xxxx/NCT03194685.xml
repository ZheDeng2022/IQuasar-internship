    <textblock>
      A Phase 1/2a dose escalation and dose ranging study of FF-10101-01 in subjects with relapsed&#xD;
      or refractory acute myeloid leukemia to determine the safety, tolerability, PK and&#xD;
      preliminary efficacy. A total of 9 cohorts will be enrolled in Phase 1 to establish the&#xD;
      Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD). Phase 2a will consist of up to 3 dose levels (high, medium, and&#xD;
      low) of which subjects with FLT3 mutations will randomly be assigned.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Subjects will receive FF-10101-01 orally once a day repeated every 28 days =1 cycle Frequent&#xD;
      blood draws will be collected to measure pharmacodynamic parameters and pharmacodynamic&#xD;
      activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Disease assessments, including bone marrow aspirates, will be performed at the beginning of&#xD;
      cycles 1-3, and every 3 months thereafter. Subjects who demonstrate objective response or&#xD;
      stable disease will be allowed to continue therapy with FF-10101-01 until , observation of&#xD;
      unacceptable adverse events, or until the subject is no longer deriving benefit based on the&#xD;
      opinion of the investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For Phase 2a long term phone follow-up for assessment of overall survival will also occur.&#xD;
