      Research hypothesis&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Diving to depths up to 90msw with an oxygen partial pressure of 130kPa in the breathing&#xD;
           gas will affect the central nervous system.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Diving to depths up to 90msw with an oxygen partial pressure of 130kPa in the breathing&#xD;
           gas will induce inflammatory changes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To investigate the presence of cerebrospinal biochemical markers in blood after diving&#xD;
           to depths up to 90msw with an oxygen partial pressure of 130kPa in the breathing gas.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To investigate the presence of inflammatory markers in blood after diving to depths up&#xD;
           to 90msw with an oxygen partial pressure of 130kPa in the breathing gas.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To investigate the presence of venous gas emboli (VGE) in blood after diving to depths&#xD;
           up to 90msw with an oxygen partial pressure of 130kPa in the breathing gas.&#xD;

      When diving with compressed air as breathing gas, a continuous accumulation of nitrogen will&#xD;
      take place in the body. The total uptake of nitrogen by the tissues is dependent on the&#xD;
      duration and depth of the performed dive. Decompression at the end of a dive can cause&#xD;
      accumulated nitrogen to form intravascular bubbles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Furthermore, at depths greater than 30 meters seawater (msw) the elevated partial pressure of&#xD;
      nitrogen in the breathing gas will exert a direct effect on the nervous system. This is known&#xD;
      as nitrogen narcosis and can cause altered cognitive function, confusion, behavioural&#xD;
      disturbance and altered level of consciousness. The effect of nitrogen narcosis gets more&#xD;
      pronounced with increasing diving depth. To avert nitrogen narcosis it is common to reduce&#xD;
      the amount of nitrogen in the breathing gas being used. At the same time the amount of oxygen&#xD;
      must also be reduced, as partial pressures of oxygen above 1,6kPa could induce seizures.&#xD;
      Usually a breathing gas mixture containing helium, nitrogen and oxygen (TriMix) is used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It has long been considered that decompression sickness (DCS) is caused by bubble formation&#xD;
      when dissolved nitrogen at the end of diving comes out of solution. Doppler ultrasound&#xD;
      techniques have shown that intravascular gas bubbles could exist even after uneventful dives.&#xD;
      Therefore, additional pathophysiological factors must be sought.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is evidence of an increased inflammatory activity in blood after diving. Signs of&#xD;
      neutrophil activation is a common finding. It is not known if hyperbaric exposure in itself&#xD;
      is enough to elicit these biochemical changes or if the presence of intravascular nitrogen&#xD;
      bubbles is needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Studies have shown that biochemical markers of central nervous system (CNS) injury can be&#xD;
      detected in blood samples obtained from patients with DCS, metabolic and neurologic disease,&#xD;
      during cardiac surgery and after traumatic brain injuries. Such markers can also be seen in&#xD;
      blood after sport activities like boxing and breath hold diving. If biochemical markers of&#xD;
      CNS injury will be present in blood after hyperbaric exposure is not known.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Swedish armed forces (SwAF) Diving and Naval Medicine Center (DNC) is responsible for&#xD;
      education and training of divers for SwAF. The centre is also responsible for research and&#xD;
      development and conduct tests for diving medicine, and tests of underwater equipment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SwAF DNC will during 2017 and 2018 be responsible for naval dive training including deep&#xD;
      dives (up to 90 msw) using TriMix as breathing gas. The partial pressure of oxygen will be&#xD;
      kept at 130kPa. The study &quot;Inflammatory and cerebrospinal biochemical markers in blood after&#xD;
      TriMix diving - an observational controlled study&quot; will be followed out during these tests.&#xD;
      It entails venous blood sampling and cardiac ultrasound.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a prospective, controlled observational study (see addendum 08/03/19 below). The&#xD;
      study aims to involve at least 16 study subjects. Half of the subjects (at least 8 persons),&#xD;
      named the intervention group, dive to depths up to 90msw with an oxygen partial pressure of&#xD;
      130kPa in the TriMix breathing gas. Half of the subjects (at least 8 persons), named the&#xD;
      control group, do not dive. The dives are part of the Swedish navy´s training programme for&#xD;
      TriMix diving.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood samples are obtained from the intervention group before and after diving (two tubes and&#xD;
      about 8mL of blood each time, in total 16mL of blood). If possible, a third blood sample are&#xD;
      taken about 24 hours after the first sample. Blood samples are obtained from the control&#xD;
      group at the same time points as from the intervention group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Immmediately after diving, cardiac ultrasound will be used to assess presence and duration of&#xD;
      VGE in the intervention group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Signs of DCS will be actively sought.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Addendum 08/03/19: A control group containing non-diving military divers was initially&#xD;
      planned. However, difficulties in subject recruitment meant that an appropriate control group&#xD;
      could not be formed. It was performed as an observational study without controls.&#xD;
