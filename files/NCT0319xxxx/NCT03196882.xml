  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Currently, there is no consensus regarding iron supplementation dose that is most beneficial&#xD;
      for maternal and offspring health during gestation. This deficit, or excess, of iron&#xD;
      prejudices the mother-child wellbeing. Therefore the hypotheses are that an iron&#xD;
      supplementation adapted to values of hemoglobin at the start of the pregnancy will would be&#xD;
      more effective in preventing iron deficiency, without increasing the risk of&#xD;
      hemoconcentration by the end of pregnancy. This would be helped optimize mother-child health&#xD;
      status.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aims of the study are to determine the highest level of effectiveness of iron&#xD;
      supplementation adapted to hemoglobin (Hb) levels in early pregnancy, which would be optimum&#xD;
      for mother-child health.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To accomplish this objective a Randomized Clinical Trial (RCT) triple-blinded was designed.&#xD;
      The study is structured as a RCT with 2 strata, depending on the Hb levels before week 12 of&#xD;
      gestation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stratum 1: If Hb from 110 to 130 g/L, randomly assigned at week 12 to receive iron supplement&#xD;
      of 40 or 80 mg/d.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stratum 2: If Hb &gt;130 g/L, randomly assigned at week 12 to receive iron supplement of 40 or&#xD;
      20 mg/d.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will be conducted in non-anemic pregnant women at early gestation stage, and their&#xD;
      subsequent newborns. The data recollected to mothers will be: socio-economic data, clinical&#xD;
      history, food item frequency, lifestyle and emotional state, and adherence to iron supplement&#xD;
      prescription. In addition, biochemical measured will be Hemoglobin, serum ferritin, C&#xD;
      reactive protein, cortisol, and alterations in the HFE gene (C282Y, H63D). In children, the&#xD;
      data collected will be: ultrasound fetal biometry, anthropometric measurements, and&#xD;
      temperament development&#xD;
&#xD;
      Should conclusive outcomes be reached, the study would indicate the optimal iron&#xD;
      supplementation dose required to promote maternal and infant health. These results would&#xD;
      contribute towards developing guidelines for good clinical practice.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The study will be conducted in 2 Primary Care Centers (PCC) from Tarragona and Reus of the&#xD;
      Catalunya Sexual and Reproductive Healthcare Service [Atención a la Salud Sexual y&#xD;
      Reproductiva (ASSIR)] of the Catalan Institute of Health [Instituto Catalán de la Salud&#xD;
      (ICS)]. The specialist health-care workers include gynecologists and midwives. The&#xD;
      participating reproductive health-care services (RHS) provide cover for urban, suburban, and&#xD;
      rural PCCs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The clinical follow-up of the pregnancy in the PCC will be according to the program set by&#xD;
      RHS. This includes a clinical visit at recruitment into the present study, a visit every&#xD;
      trimester, and one at 40 days post-partum.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the recruitment visit before week 12 of the pregnancy, the inclusion criteria will be&#xD;
      assessed (except the Hb levels and the number of fetuses) as well as the exclusion criteria.&#xD;
      Informed consent will be solicited. A clinical history will be recorded, which include date&#xD;
      of birth, socioeconomic status, parity, date of last menstruation, corrected date of last&#xD;
      menstruation, estimated date of partum, risk factors during pregnancy, pregnancy planning,&#xD;
      previous use of contraceptives, clinical antecedents, surgery and personal obstetric data,&#xD;
      toxic habits, blood pressure, height, weight of the mother (self-reported at the recruitment&#xD;
      visit and measured objectively at each clinical follow-up visit). Similar data from the&#xD;
      father will be solicited.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Moreover, a questionnaire regarding the ingestion of iron supplements, multi-vitamins, or&#xD;
      other treatments and, if a smoker, the Fagerstrom test for tobacco dependency. A blood sample&#xD;
      for standard biochemical analyses (including hemoglobin) will be sent for processing in the&#xD;
      centralized laboratory.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At visit 1, around the 12th week of gestation, Hb levels will be evaluated as will be the&#xD;
      number of fetuses (using echography) to confirm that the inclusion criteria are fulfilled. If&#xD;
      fulfilled, the individuals will be retained in the study and, if not, will be transferred out&#xD;
      of the study, and considered a screening failure. The remaining women will be assigned to&#xD;
      Stratum 1 or Stratum 2 of the study and will be randomized with respect to iron supplement&#xD;
      prescription. Clinical history will be taken, including the use of multi-vitamins and iron&#xD;
      supplements and the questionnaires filled-in about food consumption, physical activity,&#xD;
      anxiety status and tobacco dependency. ). A physical examination will be performed to measure&#xD;
      weight and blood pressure. The ultrasound data on the fetus will be recorded to assess Crown&#xD;
      Rump Length (CRL). A physical examination will be performed to measure weight and blood&#xD;
      pressure. Venous blood will be taken for analyses, the results of which will be reviewed in&#xD;
      the next clinical visit. The iron supplementation that will be needed at the next visit will&#xD;
      be prepared for distribution. Adverse events occurring since the previous visit will be&#xD;
      recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At visit 2, around week 24 of gestation, clinical history will be taken, and will include&#xD;
      questionnaire about use of multi-vitamins and iron supplements which, from this visit&#xD;
      onwards, includes the adherence to the iron supplementation prescribed. The questionnaires&#xD;
      about food consumption, physical activity, anxiety status and tobacco dependency are&#xD;
      filled-in. A physical examination will be performed to measure weight and blood pressure. The&#xD;
      fetal ultrasound data will be registered to assess status of fetus and estimated fetal&#xD;
      weight. The biochemical analyses/results will be reviewed and a further blood sample taken&#xD;
      for analysis, the results of which will be reviewed at the next clinical visit. The iron&#xD;
      supplementation that will be needed at the next visit will be prepared for distribution.&#xD;
      Adverse events occurring since the previous visit will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At visit 3, around week 36 of gestation, the clinical history will be taken, the&#xD;
      questionnaire about use of multi-vitamins and iron supplements as well as the questionnaires&#xD;
      about food consumption, physical activity, anxiety status and tobacco dependency will be&#xD;
      filled-in. A physical examination will be performed to measure weight and blood pressure. The&#xD;
      fetal ultrasound data will be recorded to assess status of fetus and estimated fetal weight&#xD;
      and the biochemical results will be evaluated. A further blood sample will be taken for&#xD;
      analyses, the results of which will be discussed at the next clinical visit. The iron&#xD;
      supplementation that will be needed at the next visit will be prepared for distribution.&#xD;
      Adverse events occurring since the previous visit will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At visit 4 (40 days post-partum), the clinical history will be taken, the questionnaire about&#xD;
      use of multi-vitamins and iron supplements as well as the questionnaires about food&#xD;
      consumption, physical activity, anxiety status and tobacco dependency will be filled-in. A&#xD;
      questionnaire on post-partum depression and the Parenting Stress Index will be applied. The&#xD;
      standard laboratory analyses results will be discussed. A further blood sample will be taken&#xD;
      for analyses. Data on birth (type of delivery) and the newborn will be recorded (weight and&#xD;
      height). Clinical history of the baby will be recorded, including: gender, status of newborn,&#xD;
      Apgar score, anthropometric data (weight, height, head circumference), breastfeeding and&#xD;
      levels of vitamin D. Cognitive development will be assessed, as well as behavioral and&#xD;
      temperament. Adverse events occurring since the previous visit will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To achieve the study's main objective, sample size is calculated in accordance with the&#xD;
      following parameters: an alpha risk of 0.05 and a beta risk of 0.20 in a two tailed test of&#xD;
      comparison. A drop-out rate or lack of data of 35% is factored-in.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To calculate the sample size, previous data from the research group of investigators were&#xD;
      consulted (Aranda, 2011, Hernández-Martínez, 2011, Ribot, 2012). A prevalence of 23.5% of&#xD;
      iron deficiency anemia was observed in the 3rd trimester in pregnant women with Hb levels of&#xD;
      110-130 g/L in the first trimester and a prevalence of risk of hemoconcentration of 14.7% in&#xD;
      the 3rd trimester of pregnant women who started pregnancy with Hb levels of 130-150 g/L.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In Stratum 1, to reduce the frequency of anemia ferropenic from 23.5% to 11.5% in the&#xD;
           intervention group supplemented with 80mg/day of iron with respect to the group&#xD;
           supplemented with 40mg/day, will be necessary to include 236 women in each group&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In Stratum 2, to reduce the frequency of hemocontration from 14.7% to 2.7% in the&#xD;
           intervention group supplemented with 20mg/day of iron with respect to the group&#xD;
           supplemented with 40mg/day, will be necessary to include 116 women in each group&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention assignment: Allocation&#xD;
&#xD;
      The pregnant women are assigned to Stratum 1 or Stratum 2 as a function of the hemoglobin&#xD;
      values in the baseline analysis of the study. They are, then, randomly assigned to 2&#xD;
      treatment groups to receive different iron supplements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stratum 1: If Hb from 110 to 130 g/L, randomly assigned at week 12 to receive iron supplement&#xD;
      of 40 or 80 mg/d.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stratum 2: If Hb &gt;130 g/L, randomly assigned at week 12 to receive iron supplement of 40 or&#xD;
      20 mg/d.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The randomization is performed using centralized computer software, which is automatic and&#xD;
      masked and applies to the electronic data collection forms, as well. The procedure for&#xD;
      randomization is independent for each Stratum.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blinding The study will be triple blind: the participant, the health-care professional, and&#xD;
      the statistician. The treatment drug will be administered &quot;blind&quot; i.e. the doses are not&#xD;
      identifiable since the packaging has the same format, presentation, and visual&#xD;
      characteristics. The laboratory of MEIJI TEDEC FARMA, SA will be responsible for&#xD;
      manufacturing, packaging and labeling the study medications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Only MEIJI TEDEC FARMA, SA and the Clinical Pharmacology Service of the Vall d'Hebron&#xD;
      Hospital in Barcelona will know the distribution codes and the composition of each of the&#xD;
      treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There would be no need for un-blinding except if an unexpected serious adverse event occurs.&#xD;
      In which case, the pharmaco-vigilance staff of TEDEC-MEIJI FARMA S.A. will take&#xD;
      responsibility for un-blinding and communicating the adverse event to the appropriate health&#xD;
      authorities. TEDEC-Meiji Farma SA will not reveal the treatment codes until the end of the&#xD;
      trial, when these data and the documents generated will be made available to the Principal&#xD;
      Investigator (VA) and the Promoter (Institut d'investigació en Atenció Primària, IDIAP, Jordi&#xD;
      Gol i Gurina ).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical methods The description of the variables studied will be performed using&#xD;
      conventional techniques. Variables with non-normal distribution will be transformed as&#xD;
      necessary for normalization of distribution of values. The Kolmogorov-Smirnov and the&#xD;
      Shapiro-Wilks test will be used to verify normality of distributions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis of the primary outcome The effects of iron dose supplement in each RCT on the&#xD;
      biochemical iron status and mother-child health will be compared using regression models&#xD;
      adjusted for those variables that can influence the relationship. Logistic regression or Cox&#xD;
      models will be applied for qualitative variables such as, for example, the percentage of&#xD;
      anemia or hemoconcentration at the end of pregnancy. Linear multiple regression models will&#xD;
      be applied for dependent quantitative variables. The models will be adjusted for those&#xD;
      variables that biologically affect the relationships studied, such as the serum ferritin&#xD;
      levels, presence of alterations in the HFE gene, age of the mother, gestational age, parity,&#xD;
      anthropometric indices, diet, and lifestyle, and the interactions between these variables.&#xD;
      Initially included in the model will be all those variables that form part of the theoretical&#xD;
      model and, in a second phase, the variables for entry into the model will be selected step by&#xD;
      step (forward and backward) to achieve the most reduced stable models.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Conditions for the application of models will be verified using standard techniques that are&#xD;
      based, essentially, on residuals analysis. The bilateral null hypothesis of normality, no&#xD;
      difference, and non-significance of the regression coefficients, will be rejected when their&#xD;
&#xD;
      Monitoring To ensure correct conduct and security of the RCT according to the requirements of&#xD;
      good clinical practice, external services will be contracted to perform the tasks of&#xD;
      monitoring of the participating centers according to the requirements of the Spanish Agency&#xD;
      of Medicines and Health Products [Agencia Española de Medicamentos y Productos Sanitarios;&#xD;
      AEMPS].&#xD;
