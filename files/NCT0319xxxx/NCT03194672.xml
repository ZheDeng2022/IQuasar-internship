    <textblock>
      Randomized trial of a rapid repeat pregnancy prevention program for adolescent mothers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Five hundred adolescent mothers from central Ohio will be enrolled--half will be assigned to&#xD;
      an intervention that features nurses and social workers providing extra assistance during&#xD;
      late pregnancy and the early postnatal period and half will be assigned to a standard of care&#xD;
      intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OhioHealth is the lead entity. Nationwide Children's Hospital serves as the local independent&#xD;
      evaluator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This federally funded contract is supported by the Family and Youth Services Bureau.&#xD;

    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>This experimental condition has three major components:&#xD;
Individual sessions: Roughly 12 90-minute sessions over 3 months Prenatal sessions covering contraceptive options, including long-acting reversible contraception. Prenatal and postnatal sessions will also cover (a) financial benefits of smoking cessation; (b)financial literacy/budgeting skills based upon selected components of the Money Matters curriculum; (c) establishing concrete steps to reach educational/career goals; (d) healthy eating habits; and (e) importance of HPV vaccinations and getting a medical home.&#xD;
Transportation assistance for medical home appointments.&#xD;
Electronic Prompts/Reminders to Encourage Completion of Goals.</description>

  <arm_group>
    <arm_group_label>Treatment as Usual Control Condition</arm_group_label>
    <arm_group_type>No Intervention</arm_group_type>
    <description>The comparison group will be a Usual Care control group. The control group will have access to standard medical and behavior health services as part of routine care. Prior to randomization, each enrolled participant will receive a listing of contact information for organizations offering this routine care.&#xD;
The only interaction the HAT providers will have with control group participants is to have periodic and brief phone conversations in which updated changes in contact information will be collected. The HAT providers will also obtain updated changes in contact information for HAT intervention group participants.</description>

    <intervention_name>Healthy Adolescent Transitions (HAT) program</intervention_name>
    <description>The components of the intervention are described in the arm description.&#xD;
The intervention is based upon the theoretical framework of behavioral economics, which suggests that low intensity &quot;nudges&quot; can help recipients accomplish their own goals. All components of the intervention are voluntary; some participants may wish to discuss all components, while other participants may wish to discuss selected components consistent with their priorities.</description>
