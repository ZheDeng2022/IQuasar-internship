    <textblock>
      This intervention study is a part of the FOCUS (Frailty Management Optimization Through EIP&#xD;
      AHA Commitments and Utilization of Stakeholders Input) project which purpose is to critically&#xD;
      reduce the burden of frailty in Europe by assisting those partners within the European&#xD;
      Innovation Partnership for Active Healthy Ageing (EIPAHA) with commitments focusing on early&#xD;
      diagnosis/ screening and/or management of frailty to achieve scalability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      FOCUS aims to critically reduce the burden of frailty in Europe by developing methodologies&#xD;
      and tools to assist entities focusing on early diagnosis, screening and management of frailty&#xD;
      to achieve scalability. Frailty is a common clinical syndrome in older adults that brings an&#xD;
      increased risk for poor health outcomes including falls, incident disability, hospitalization&#xD;
      and mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The FOCUS Consortium brings together a multidisciplinary team of specialists from 10&#xD;
      organizations in 6 countries - Italy, Poland, Portugal, Spain, Netherlands, United Kingdom -&#xD;
      that will work on developing, piloting and disseminating methodologies and tools to assist&#xD;
      entities focusing on early diagnosis, screening and management of frailty to achieve&#xD;
      scalability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Wroclaw Medical University actively participates in all projects for the advances in science,&#xD;
      entrepreneurship, technological innovation, both with public authorities, local governments,&#xD;
      and enterprises. In FOCUS project, WMU is responsible for Evaluation of the project and&#xD;
      collaborates with the others partners in Coordination of the project, Dissemination of the&#xD;
      project, Synthesis of learning and realities of practice, Analysis and guidelines&#xD;
      development, Creation of Network and Platform for knowledge exchange, Test of guidelines in a&#xD;
      set of commitments (Work Package 7 - WP7).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The outcomes of this proposal will offer significant potential improvements for innovative,&#xD;
      coordinated and comprehensive community based prevention with regard to the optimisation of&#xD;
      functional capacity tools to address pre-frailty, and for improving the management of&#xD;
      frailty.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The registered study has its own protocol developed by Wroclaw Medical University research&#xD;
      team and will be implemented within WP7 of the FOCUS project.&#xD;

      This is a prospective intervention study. The study is expected screening about 320&#xD;
      participants - persons aged more than 60 years old recruited from Universities of the Third&#xD;
      Age, day care centers, primary care centers, geriatrics out-patient clinics and from nursing&#xD;
      homes. We are expected to enroll 270 potential participants (at least 135 participants) to 5&#xD;
      groups: 4 intervention groups and 1 control group without any intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient qualification is based on criteria developed by Fried et al 2001.&#xD;

           relationship/ without relationship, level of education, place of residence, economic&#xD;
           status; the number of hospitalizations in the last 3 years (including kind of ward); the&#xD;
           number and kind of chronic diseases (ICD-10); the number of permanent medications;&#xD;
           employment situation; number of traveling in the last year; having pets; number of&#xD;
           languages the participants can speak; number of falls&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Rating of patients' difficulties in the implementation of the intervention (Did the&#xD;
           patients perform the interventions? How often? Was it difficult to the patients?)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Observations sheet: height, weight, BMI, hand grip strength, circumference of arm&#xD;
