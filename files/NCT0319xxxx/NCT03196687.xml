  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with type 2 DM may develop a cardiomyopathy often called diabetic cardiomyopathy&#xD;
      which is characterized by left ventricular diastolic dysfunction in early stages&#xD;
&#xD;
      Type 2 DM is associated with various types of subclinical target organ damage resulting in&#xD;
      elevated risk of CVD events, moreover there is growing evidence that a prediabetic status,&#xD;
      such as impaired fasting glucose is also related to subclinical target organ damage when&#xD;
      compared to a group with normal glucose metabolism Diabetes mellitus is a well-studied major&#xD;
      risk factor for coronary heart diseases, which is one of the leading causes of death&#xD;
      worldwide. Another distinct entity of diabetes-related cardiac affection is the diabetic&#xD;
      cardiomyopathy. This entity of cardic affection by diabetes still needs more and more&#xD;
      attention, not only because it is common in diabetic patients, but also because of its easy&#xD;
      detection by the simple, inexpensive and widely available diagnostic echocardiography.&#xD;

&#xD;
      The proposed mechanisms that may be implicated in the pathogenesis of diabetic cardiomyopathy&#xD;
      include autonomic dysfunction, microvascular disease, interstitial fibrosis and metabolic&#xD;
      disorders. However, the actual causes and mechanisms remain unclear.&#xD;
