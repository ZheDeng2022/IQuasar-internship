  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Motivation represents a core aspect of goal-directed behavior as it determines how much&#xD;
      effort individuals are willing to invest to reach their goals. While research on effort-based&#xD;
      decision-making focuses mainly on effort preferences in younger adults, loss of motivation&#xD;
      might be a key component of the apathetic tendencies frequently seen in older adults.&#xD;
      However, an open question refers to which brain mechanisms underlie motivational processes in&#xD;
      older adults. The investigators have recently shown that the frontopolar cortex plays a&#xD;
      crucial in motivating the exertion of rewarded effort in younger adults. The goal of the&#xD;
      current study is to determine whether frontopolar cortex plays a crucial role for motivation&#xD;
      also in older adults and may thus be a promising target for improving the motivation deficits&#xD;
      in healthy aging. Participants perform computer-based experimental tasks measuring the&#xD;
      propensity to exert cognitive or physical effort for monetary rewards. During task&#xD;
      performance, participants receive anodal or sham transcranial direct current stimulation&#xD;
      (tDCS) over their frontopolar cortex. The study tests whether tDCS over frontopolar cortex&#xD;
      allows modulating participants' motivation to engage in rewarded effort.&#xD;

      2018, Biological Psychiatry). The goal of the current study is to determine whether&#xD;
      frontopolar cortex plays a crucial role for motivation also in older adults and may thus be a&#xD;
      promising target for improving the motivation deficits in healthy aging. 30 older&#xD;
      participants (65-80 years) perform computer-based experimental tasks measuring the propensity&#xD;
      to exert cognitive or physical effort for monetary rewards. During task performance,&#xD;
      participants receive 1 mA anodal or sham transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) over&#xD;
      their frontopolar cortex. The study tests whether tDCS over frontopolar cortex allows&#xD;
      modulating participants' motivation to engage in rewarded effort.&#xD;

    <description>The project seeks to test the causal role of FPC in discounting of cognitive and physical effort in healthy older adults. For that purpose, participants perform a task on a computer which requires the participants to decide whether the participants are willing to exert cognitive or physical effort for a monetary reward. Participants perform this task both under anodal and under sham stimulation. It is tested whether anodal, relative to sham, stimulation increases participants' willingness to engage in rewarded cognitive or physical effort.</description>
