  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The stress-related hormone cortisol has been studied in depression for decades. However,&#xD;
      relatively little is known about the role of cortisol in psychological features of&#xD;
      depression. Basic research shows that cortisol modulates brain processes that are highly&#xD;
      relevant to depression (especially the neural substrates of negative biases in learning and&#xD;
      memory formation). However, very few studies have directly examined the effects of cortisol&#xD;
      on neural circuitry of learning in depressed humans. In addition, the effects of cortisol on&#xD;
      the neural substrates of learning differ for males and females. The toll of depression is&#xD;
      especially high in women, who are roughly twice as likely as men to suffer from depression.&#xD;
      Thus, the primary goal of this project is to investigate the effects of cortisol on the&#xD;
      neural circuitry of learning in depressed women.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A secondary goal is to investigate whether early life adversity moderates cortisol's effects&#xD;
      on the neural circuitry of learning. Animal data suggests that early life adversity causes&#xD;
      life-long biases toward learning in threatening conditions associated with elevated cortisol.&#xD;
      In addition, new data from humans suggests that alterations in cortisol traditionally&#xD;
      ascribed to depression may stem in part from early adversity rather than depression per se.&#xD;
      Thus, this study will examine effects of cortisol on the neural circuitry of learning in&#xD;
      depressed and healthy women with and without history of early life adversity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will use pharmacological manipulation of cortisol levels (compared to placebo)&#xD;
      during measurement of brain activity at rest and during memory encoding of emotional and&#xD;
      neutral stimuli. The study will also measure whether cortisol alters the negative biases in&#xD;
      emotional memory often seen in depression. In doing so, the study will examine the role of&#xD;
      cortisol in neural networks associated with emotional learning that are often implicated in&#xD;
      depression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Medications that target cortisol receptors in the brain may be beneficial in the treatment of&#xD;
      depression. However, this knowledge has yet to inform clinical practice, and mechanisms of&#xD;
      action of these medications are not well understood. This project is significant because it&#xD;
      provides the prerequisite knowledge (and develops a paradigm) that can be used in the future&#xD;
      in the development of more effective targeted intervention strategies.&#xD;
