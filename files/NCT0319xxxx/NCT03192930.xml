      When diving with compressed air, a continuous accumulation of nitrogen will take place in the&#xD;
      body. The total uptake of nitrogen by the tissues is dependent on the duration and depth of&#xD;
      the performed dive. During prolonged exposure to hyperbaric conditions the body eventually&#xD;
      will become saturated with nitrogen. In a hyperbaric environment corresponding to a depth of&#xD;
      30 meters seawater, nitrogen saturation could be expected after about 24 hours. Decompression&#xD;
      can cause accumulated nitrogen to form intravascular bubbles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It has long been considered that decompression sickness (DCS) is caused by bubble formation&#xD;
      when dissolved nitrogen at the end of diving comes out of solution. Doppler ultrasound&#xD;
      techniques have shown that intravascular gas bubbles could exist even after uneventful dives.&#xD;
      Therefore, additional pathophysiological factors must be sought.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dehydration is a common finding after diving in water. It is probably caused by a combination&#xD;
      of a non-existent water intake during diving and a physiologically increased urine&#xD;
      production, caused by the increased ambient pressure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is evidence of an increased inflammatory activity in blood after diving. Signs of&#xD;
      neutrophil activation is a common finding. It is not known if hyperbaric exposure in itself&#xD;
      is enough to elicit these biochemical changes or if the presence of intravascular nitrogen&#xD;
      bubbles is needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Studies have shown that biochemical markers of central nervous system (CNS) injury can be&#xD;
      detected in blood samples obtained from patients with DCS, metabolic and neurologic disease,&#xD;
      during cardiac surgery and after traumatic brain injuries. Such markers can also be seen in&#xD;
      blood after sport activities like boxing and breath hold diving. If biochemical markers of&#xD;
      CNS injury will be present in blood after hyperbaric exposure is not known.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Diving is a common activity in society. It is practised both recreationally and&#xD;
      professionally. The police, coast guard, emergency services and armed forces employ&#xD;
      professional divers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Swedish armed forces (SwAF) Diving and Naval Medicine Center (DNC) is responsible for&#xD;
      education and training of divers for SwAF. The centre is also responsible for research and&#xD;
      development and conduct tests for diving medicine, and tests of underwater equipment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SwAF DNC will during 2017 perform saturation diving tests in a dry chamber environment. The&#xD;
      study &quot;Inflammatory and cerebrospinal biochemical markers in blood during prolonged&#xD;
      hyperbaric exposure - an observational controlled study&quot; will be followed out during these&#xD;
      tests. It entails venous blood sampling, spirometric testing and cardiac ultrasound.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a prospective, controlled observational study. The study aims to involve at least 16&#xD;
      study subjects. Half of the subjects (at least 8 persons), named the intervention group, will&#xD;
      be exposed to hyperbaric conditions. The hyperbaric exposure is part of the Swedish navy&#xD;
      saturation diving tests. Half of the subjects (at least 8 persons), named the control group,&#xD;
      will experience no hyperbaric exposure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intervention group will be compressed in a dry hyperbaric chamber to 4 ATA and remain at&#xD;
      that pressure for 36 hours. They will then be decompressed 0,5 meters/hour for 30 hours,&#xD;
      after which they will be decompressed 0,375 meters/hour for 40 hours. After 70 hours of&#xD;
      decompression normal atmospheric pressure will be reached and the subjects will leave the&#xD;
      hyperbaric chamber. The oxygen partial pressure inside the chamber will be actively&#xD;
      controlled and never exceed 50 kPa.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Members of the intervention group will be examined by a physician trained in diving medicine&#xD;
      before and after the hyperbaric exposure. Spirometric testing of lung function will be&#xD;
      carried out at both these occasions. Immmediately after hyperbaric exposure cardiac&#xD;
      ultrasound will be used to assess presence and duration of VGE.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Five blood samples (6 mL blood each) will be obtained from all study subjects from both&#xD;
      groups according to the following plan:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  before compression commences&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  about one hour before decompression commences&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  within one hour after leaving the hyperbaric chamber&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  about 24 hours after leaving the hyperbaric chamber&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  if possible, about 5-7 days after leaving the hyperbaric chamber.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood samples are obtained from the control group at the same time points as from the&#xD;
      intervention group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to above mentioned samples, blood samples (6 mL blood each) regarding fluid&#xD;
      balance will be obtained from intervention group subjects before, during and after hyperbaric&#xD;
      exposure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Signs of DCS will be actively sought.&#xD;
