    <textblock>
      Asthma is a heterogeneous disease, usually characterized by chronic airway inflammation. It&#xD;
      is defined by the history of respiratory symptoms such as wheeze, shortness of breath, chest&#xD;
      tightness and cough that vary over time and in intensity, together with variable expiatory&#xD;
      airflow limitation. This definition was reached by consensus, based on consideration of the&#xD;
      characteristics that are typical of asthma and that distinguish it from other respiratory&#xD;
      conditions .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Asthma is a problem worldwide, with an estimated 300 million affected individuals .It appears&#xD;
      that the global prevalence of asthma ranges from 1% to 18% of the population in different&#xD;
      countries .&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Over the past years, an increase in the number of emergency department (ED) visits for asthma&#xD;
      exacerbation has been reported. Most of these visits are for preschool children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although pulmonary function tests are commonly used to assess the severity of acute asthma in&#xD;
      adults, they are difficult to perform in children, especially those who are younger than five&#xD;
      years old .&#xD;
&#xD;
      spirometry measures pulmonary markers such as vital capacity and maximal forced expiatory&#xD;
      volume in 1 second. Well-trained personnel are required to perform these tests, and they are&#xD;
      not routinely available in the ED. Peak flow has been used in the ED to measure the degree of&#xD;
      respiratory obstruction .This technique is difficult to perform in children less than 6 years&#xD;
      of age because of their lack of coordination and comprehension .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adequate evaluation of the severity of asthma exacerbation is important for the initial&#xD;
      management of patients, as well as for assessing the clinical response. However, severity is&#xD;
      more difficult to assess in children. The clinical evaluation and physician's experience are&#xD;
      often not enough to determine the degree of respiratory obstruction .&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the emergency room setting, the most critical issue facing the attending physician is,&#xD;
      deciding the adequacy of outpatient therapy of acute asthma, or when hospitalization is&#xD;
      indicated. Traditionally, this decision is used to be made according to the clinical history,&#xD;
      physical examination, laboratory results and response to therapy of the patient .&#xD;
&#xD;
      A number of asthma severity measures or scoring systems have been established to estimate the&#xD;
      degree of airway obstruction for children in whom the standard measurements cannot be&#xD;
      performed. These systems combine a number of physical signs, such as respiratory rate and&#xD;
      accessory muscle use, to form an aggregate score that estimates the severity of an acute&#xD;
      asthma exacerbation .no scoring system is perfect, but some method of assessing severity in&#xD;
      children is needed when spirometry testing is not obtainable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      modified the pulmonary index was reported by adding 2 scoring items, namely heart rate and&#xD;
      SpO2 at room temperature, and by dividing the method of heart rate and respiratory rate&#xD;
      scoring depending on which of 2 age groups the patient belong to. Modified Pulmonary Index&#xD;
      Score is a quantitative method of evaluating respiratory conditions in asthmatic subjects&#xD;
      modified and consists of 6 evaluation items, which are important for the assessment of&#xD;
      dyspnea and are relatively easy to assess in clinical practice, namely heart rate,&#xD;
      respiratory rate, accessory muscle use, inspiratory to expiatory flow ratio, degree of&#xD;
      wheezing, and oxygen saturation in room air.&#xD;
&#xD;
      the predictive validity and reproducibility of the Modified Pulmonary Index Score for asthma&#xD;
      exacerbation was reported in 30 children with a mean age of 7.6 ± 5.5 years in 2005. They&#xD;
      found good correlations of the Modified Pulmonary Index Score with clinical outcomes such as&#xD;
      ICU admission. The Modified Pulmonary Index Score appears to be suitable for measuring the&#xD;
      severity of acute asthma exacerbation, and was applied as primary outcome measurement in some&#xD;
      clinical trials .&#xD;
&#xD;
      A significant correlation between Modified Pulmonary Index Score at hospitalization and&#xD;
      hospitalization period in children above 5 years old, suggesting that Modified Pulmonary&#xD;
      Index Score was useful for predicting the clinical course after hospitalization. However, its&#xD;
      applicability to preschool children has not yet been fully elucidated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Modified Pulmonary Index Score can be a useful tool for several aspects during acute&#xD;
      asthma attacks, including the determination of a treatment plan, and prediction of the period&#xD;
      of hospitalization in admitted patients .&#xD;
