  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a phase 2 randomized double blind 8-week treatment trial of intranasal OXT vs.&#xD;
      placebo in 50 subjects aged 5 to 17 years with PWS in order to assess IN-OXT's affect on&#xD;
      measurements of (1) eating behaviors (2) repetitive behaviors (3) weight and body composition&#xD;
      (4) quality of life (5) salivary OXT and hormone levels (including ghrelin, pancreatic&#xD;
      polypeptide, peptide YY, GLP-1, insulin, glucagon, testosterone, and estrogen). If superior&#xD;
      to placebo, this data will add to the current knowledge that OXT is an effective treatment&#xD;
      for hyperphagia as well as other symptoms of PWS.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Prader-Willi Syndrome (PWS) is a rare neurodevelopmental disorder caused by lack of&#xD;
      expression of paternally derived imprinted material on chromosome 15q11-q13. PWS is&#xD;
      characterized by mild to moderate intellectual disabilities, repetitive/compulsive behaviors&#xD;
      and rigidity, social cognition deficits and severe hypotonia at birth, followed by the onset&#xD;
      of hyperphagia later in life. Obesity is responsible for the majority of the morbidity and&#xD;
      mortality associated with PWS, and compulsive eating behaviors are most responsible for&#xD;
      diminishing the quality of life for caregivers and family members. Oxytocin has been&#xD;
      implicated in the pathophysiology of PWS and there have been small studies of intranasal&#xD;
      oxytocin (IN-OXT) in this population. To date, however, studies have not been adequately&#xD;
      powered to detect significance in target symptoms of hyperphagia and associated symptoms of&#xD;
      individuals with PWS. The primary goal of this study is to examine the safety and efficacy of&#xD;
      IN-OXT on hyperphagia, as measured by the Hyperphagia Questionnaire-Clinical Trails, from&#xD;
      baseline to week 8. Currently, there are no effective treatments available to manage&#xD;
      hyperphagia in patients with PWS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY DESIGN: This is an 8-week double-blind, randomized study in 50 children with PWS aged&#xD;
      5-17. Participation involves 2 in-person visits to our program and 5 remote visits. Travel&#xD;
      expenses will be reimbursed to participating families.&#xD;
