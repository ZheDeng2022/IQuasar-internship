      In past few years new anticoagulants have been developed which directly inhibit thrombin or&#xD;
      factor X.factor x inhibitor is available in Pakistan. The superior efficacy of Rivroxaban has&#xD;
      been shown in Deep Venous Thrombosis in EINSTEIN study (3).Its definite superiority in&#xD;
      prevention of embolic stroke in nonvalvular atrial fibrillation is evidenced by the study&#xD;
      ROCKET AF (4). With Rivroxaban no monitoring is required, and also there are no drug&#xD;
      interactions .There are few pilot studies of using Rivroxaban in cerebral venous thrombosis.&#xD;
      This study is therefore required to find its efficacy in CVT patients as well as its&#xD;
      comparison with Coumadin&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cerebral venous thrombosis is rare form of stroke, accounting .5 to 1% only (1)Exact estimate&#xD;
      for Pakistani population is not known Mubarak et al described 6- year imaging incidence and&#xD;
      prevalence of CVST to be 10.22% and 11.055% respectively(2) .Majority of cerebral venous&#xD;
      stroke patients are females in reproductive age. Coumadin is one of the notorious drugs to be&#xD;
      used in pregnancy categorized as X. it also has many drug interactions .and there are diet&#xD;
      restrictions too being on Coumadin. It also requires maintanence of prothrombin time in&#xD;
      certain range which means patient has to go under phlebotomy at least twice a month. Moreover&#xD;
      not all laboratories are well equipped resulting in poor test sensitivity. and at times&#xD;
      clinicians keep patients on suboptimum doses for fear of bleeding ending with poor efficacy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In past few years new anticoagulants have been developed which directly inhibit thrombin or&#xD;
      factor X.factor x inhibitor is available in Pakistan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The superior efficacy of Rivroxaban has been shown in Deep Venous Thrombosis in EINSTEIN&#xD;
      study (3).Its definite superiority in prevention of embolic stroke in nonvalvular atrial&#xD;
      fibrillation is evidenced by the study ROCKET AF (4). With Rivroxaban no monitoring is&#xD;
      required, and also there are no drug interactions .There are few pilot studies of using&#xD;
      Rivroxaban in cerebral venous thrombosis. This study is therefore required to find its&#xD;
      efficacy in CVT patients as well as its comparison with Coumadin .&#xD;
&#xD;
      OBJECTIVE To Compare the efficacy of Rivroxaban to Warfarin in Cerebral Venous Thrombosis&#xD;
      MATERIAL AND METHODS STUDY DESIGN: Quasi Experimental; Descriptive cross sectional&#xD;
&#xD;
      DURATION OF STUDY:&#xD;
&#xD;
      6 months to 1 year&#xD;
&#xD;
      SAMLE SIZE :&#xD;
&#xD;
      50 patients SAMPLING TECHNIQUE : Consecutive (non probability) sampling.&#xD;
&#xD;
      INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients of either gender Age between 13 years and 50 years Patients with proven CVT on neuro&#xD;
      imaging (CTV, o MRV)&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients suffering from Chronic Liver disesase Patients having contraindications for oral&#xD;
      anticoagulation Patients suffering from hematological or brain malignancy Patients whose MRV&#xD;
      and CTV do not support CVT&#xD;
&#xD;
      DATA COLLECTION PROCEDURE After taking permission from hospital ethical review committee ,&#xD;
      All patients with confirmed CVT based on established criteria using any NOAC or WARFARIN&#xD;
      presenting to PIMS or FFH hospitals will be enrolled. Data will be obtained by retrospective&#xD;
      manner if they are using anticoagulants for more than 6 months. If patients are using&#xD;
      anticoagulants for less than 6 months, they will be enrolled and followed up for six months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DATA ANALYSIS The data will be analyzed using SPSS version 16.0. Descriptive analysis will be&#xD;
      done and reported as mean ± SD for continuous variables like age whereas frequencies and&#xD;
      percentages will be calculated for categorical variables such as gender, individual risk&#xD;
      factors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      P-value ≤ 0.05 will be significant. Results will be presented in tabulated or graphical&#xD;
      forms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome measures Outcome measures will include any hemorrhage or recurrent CVT based on&#xD;
      repeat MRI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MRs Scale Secondary Outcome Comparison of cost of two treatment groups.&#xD;
