      This is a study of study of My HealtheVet (MHV) use by Veterans diagnosed with Human&#xD;
      Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) and VA providers/staff who care for them. The investigators hope&#xD;
      to learn and understand how MHV can improve the self-management of chronic conditions like&#xD;
      HIV. First, the investigators will review Veteran medical records to look at the relationship&#xD;
      between use of MHV and whether it has a positive or negative impact on the Veteran's&#xD;
      management of HIV. Next, the investigators will interview participants to find out how MHV&#xD;
      for self-management is used by Veterans and to find out why Veterans and providers choose to&#xD;
      use (or not use) specific MHV tools. Lastly, the investigators will use the information found&#xD;
      from the first two steps and create an intervention that will encourage non-MHV users to use&#xD;
      the MHV tools that can help achieve health-related goals. Once the intervention has been&#xD;
      developed,Veterans and providers will participate in a &quot;cognitive walkthrough&quot; to help the&#xD;
      researchers test the intervention to see if it is usable, possible, and acceptable.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Over the last twenty years, HIV has transformed from a terminal disease to a condition with&#xD;
      near normal life expectancy for patients who follow ideal treatment regimens. HIV-infected&#xD;
      individuals still face many challenges and need to be active in self-management of HIV and&#xD;
      other conditions in order to live a healthy life. In order to ensure that this population of&#xD;
      HIV-infected individuals actively self-manages the condition, personal health records (PHRs)&#xD;
      should be used more often. PHRs may simplify disease self-management, improve health&#xD;
      outcomes, and reduce unnecessary health care use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The VA has one of the nation's largest PHR systems - My HealtheVet (MHV). MHV includes&#xD;
      features that can help patient's self-manage the disease (e.g., prescription refill, viewing&#xD;
      lab results view, secure messaging). While there has been recognition that MHV holds promise&#xD;
      as a self-management tool, there has not yet been an examination of use of MHV features and&#xD;
      the relationship to health outcomes in any chronic disease group, let alone in HIV-infected&#xD;
      Veterans.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this project is to evaluate MHV use by HIV-infected Veterans and providers,&#xD;
      by completing three aims/steps.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim/Step 1: Describe the relationship between use of MHV tools for self-management across&#xD;
      HIV-infected Veterans and determine the relationship to health outcomes and care processes in&#xD;
      these Veterans through review of medical records.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will use the VA medical record data, which allows for the study of the&#xD;
      diverse VA patient population with patients from a range of personal backgrounds, geographic&#xD;
      locations, and VA health care networks. HIV infection will be determined by the presence of&#xD;
      two outpatient HIV diagnoses or one inpatient HIV diagnosis. This study will use a&#xD;
      retrospective group of HIV-infected Veterans who used MHV between October 2007- October 2018&#xD;
      to evaluate the relationship between patient HIV care outcomes and MHV tool use. The&#xD;
      investigators will look at data to carefully consider HIV-infected patient health status,&#xD;
      health care received, and activity. The investigators will also look at Quality of Care (QC)&#xD;
      outcomes which include medication adherence, CD4 count, viral load testing and detectable&#xD;
      viral load, appointments, patient cancellations, patient no-shows, emergency department&#xD;
      visits, flu vaccination, and syphilis and lipid testing. This aim/step will allow the&#xD;
      investigators to examine differences in VA patients who have opted to use MHV versus those&#xD;
      who have not opted to use MHV.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim/Step 2: Describe how Veterans with HIV use MHV for self-management, and why Veterans&#xD;
      choose to use (or not to use) specific MHV tools; and similarly how and why providers use (or&#xD;
      do not use) MHV.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will interview Veterans and providers to learn what motivates certain&#xD;
      patients and providers/staff to use MHV in a certain way, or to understand MHV system issues,&#xD;
      as well as attitudes and perceptions that prevent others from using MHV. The investigators&#xD;
      will select patients and providers from six VA medical centers and interview those with&#xD;
      high-, low, or no- MHV use. The investigators will discuss how participants use MHV to manage&#xD;
      HIV and other conditions. The investigators will discuss with Veterans how providers use MHV&#xD;
      as a tool for communication and coordination. With Veterans not using MHV (or minimal use),&#xD;
      the investigators will ask about reasons. The interviews will be audio-recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim/Step 3: Incorporate findings from Aims/Steps 1 and 2 to design an intervention that will&#xD;
      be tested by Veterans and providers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will compare the data from aims/steps 1 and 2 to develop an intervention&#xD;
      that may improve self-management in Veterans with HIV. The investigators will identify&#xD;
      Veterans and providers from two VA medical centers that will help the investigators test the&#xD;
      intervention through &quot;cognitive walkthroughs.&quot; Cognitive walkthroughs are used to test an&#xD;
      intervention that is in the early stages of development. Veterans and providers will be the&#xD;
      first to test if the intervention is acceptable and feasible. Participants will also offer&#xD;
      feedback to the researchers as it relates to problems with using the intervention. The&#xD;
      cognitive walkthroughs will be audio- and video-recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additional Aim a: Analyze qualitative data across the racial/ethnic and gender groups to&#xD;
      evaluate MHV use, utilizing these findings to tailor interventions to racial/ethnic minority&#xD;
      groups use an modified intervention mapping approach.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will develop an MHV intervention that meets the diversity of MHV user's&#xD;
      needs, including Black and women Veterans. These findings could help MHV better understand&#xD;
      how to target new interventions to potentially increase access to MHV and increase use of MHV&#xD;
      for managing chronic conditions, among Black Veterans.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additional Aim b: Develop a protocol for conducting virtual modified intervention mapping.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will develop the capability to conduct modified intervention mapping&#xD;
      virtually. As no standard protocol has been developed for conducting intervention mapping&#xD;
      virtually, the development of such protocol can contribute to lower cost, timely, and&#xD;
      effective intervention design.&#xD;
