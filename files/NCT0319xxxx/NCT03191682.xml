    <textblock>
      This study is carried out to test the safety of a study drug called PRL3-ZUMAB. PRL3-ZUMAB is&#xD;
      an investigational drug that has not yet been approved by the Food and Drug Administration&#xD;
      (FDA) or any other regulatory authorities for commercial purposes. This is the first study in&#xD;
      which PRL3-ZUMAB will be given to humans. The study drug has been tested in animals and was&#xD;
      found to be well-tolerated with minimal side effects. This research study will test different&#xD;
      doses of the drug to see which dose is safest in people.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      PRL-3 is involved in cellular processes driving metastasis, including cell proliferation,&#xD;
      invasion, motility and survival and has been shown to be upregulated and overexpressed in&#xD;
      cancer tissues, in contrast to low or no expression in most normal tissues. In mouse models&#xD;
      of PRL3-positive gastric cancers, PRL3-ZUMAB, a first-in-class humanized antibody against&#xD;
      PRL-3, has shown to reduce tumour growth and increase survival. In contrast, no response was&#xD;
      seen in PRL3-negative gastric cancer mouse models, reflecting the exquisite target&#xD;
      specificity of PRL3-ZUMAB.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Because PRL3-ZUMAB has produced little apparent toxicity in Good Laboratory Practice (GLP)&#xD;
      toxicology studies, it is expected to have a favorable adverse event (AE) profile in humans.&#xD;
      PRL3-ZUMAB has the potential to be an anti-tumor agent in the management of solid tumors. In&#xD;
      this first-in-human study, the Phase Ia study will confirm safety, tolerability and establish&#xD;
      evidence for anti-tumor activity in advanced, solid tumor patients in the dose expansion&#xD;
      phase (Phase Ib).&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Rationale for Doses Selected: Administration of 50-150 Î¼g PRL3-zumab/dose significantly&#xD;
      reduced PRL-3-positive lung tumor burden in Balb/C nude mice metastatic tumor models (p =&#xD;
      0.044, Kruskal-Wallis test).&#xD;
&#xD;
      These results established the range of 50-150 ug PRL3-zumab/dose as sufficiently efficacious&#xD;
      exposure levels for maximal suppression of PRL-3-positive tumors in rodents in this&#xD;
      experimental setting. Importantly, this dose range did not cause any undesirable side effects&#xD;
      - mice receiving these doses of PRL3-zumab displayed normal weight gain and physical&#xD;
      activity, as compared to untreated mice. Based on these observations, the median dose of 100&#xD;
      ug PRL3-zumab/dose (i.e. approximately 4-5 mg/kg, depending on mice body weight between 20 to&#xD;
      25 g) was set as the pharmacologically active dose (PAD) in all subsequent animal treatment&#xD;
      experiments. Assuming a PAD in rodent tumor models of 5 mg/kg, a PAD of around 0.4 mg/kg is&#xD;
      expected in humans by converting this into the Minimal Anticipated Biologically Effect Level&#xD;
      (MABEL) in humans by dividing by a factor of 12.3 (based on FDA Guidance for Industry:&#xD;
      Estimating the Maximum Safe Starting Dose in Initial Clinical Trials for Therapeutics in&#xD;
      Adult Healthy Volunteers).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the monkey toxicokinetics study, PRL3-zumab was administered IV over 8 weeks at 2 week&#xD;
      intervals. Dose amounts of 4 to 36 mg/kg (0 mg/kg for controls) were used. As the dose&#xD;
      increased from 4 to 36 mg/kg, the systemic exposure (AUC0-168 and C0) to PRL3-zumab increased&#xD;
      dose-proportionally on Day 1 and 57 and there was no marked drug accumulation for PRL3-zumab&#xD;
      at any dose level. Therefore, the no observed adverse effect level (NOAEL) in the GLP&#xD;
      toxicology study in cynomolgus monkeys for PRL3-zumab was considered to be 36 mg/kg/dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Using the standard safety factor of 1/10th of the NOAEL as the starting dose for humans&#xD;
      yields a human dose of 3.6 mg/kg/dose. As this is a first-in-class compound and&#xD;
      first-in-human study, the investigators have factored in a greater safety margin of an&#xD;
      additional 1/10th of the starting dose,resulting in a final starting dose of 0.3 mg/kg/dose.&#xD;
      Importantly, while this starting dose provides a 100-fold safety margin compared to the&#xD;
      NOAEL, it is also within the estimated human PAD range (as determined from rodent studies).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will perform 3-fold escalations from 0.3 mg/kg to 6 mg/kg and will use the&#xD;
      correlative PK and PDn data to guide further doses and to determine the maximum tolerated&#xD;
      dose (MTD) and optimum biologic dose (OBD).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Taking into account the pharmacologically active dose (PAD) in mouse tumor models of 5 mg/kg,&#xD;
      and converting this into the human effective dose (HED) by a factor of 12.3 (based on FDA&#xD;
      Guidance for Industry: Estimating the Maximum Safe Starting Dose in Initial Clinical Trials&#xD;
      for Therapeutics in Adult Healthy Volunteers), a PAD of 0.4 mg/kg is expected for humans.&#xD;
      Thus, the proposed final starting dose of 0.3 mg/kg/dose is indeed within the PAD range.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before the start of each new dose cohort, a review of the adverse event profile and&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics (where available) will be conducted by the investigators before dose&#xD;
      escalation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once the MTD or OBD has been determined, the investigators will conduct the dose expansion&#xD;
      part (phase Ib) of the study which will include PRL3-positive tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Rationale for Study Population: As this is a FIH study, the risk-benefit ratio of the drug&#xD;
      is unknown. Therefore, the study population of patients with advanced solid tumors who no&#xD;
      longer respond to standard therapy or for whom no standard therapy is available, would be&#xD;
      appropriate for this study as they may benefit from treatment with PRL3-ZUMAB.&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Rationale for Study Design: This phase 1, open label, dose-escalation study of PRL3-ZUMAB&#xD;
      will use titration from low doses to higher doses of PRL3-ZUMAB in order to assess the PK,&#xD;
      PDn, and potential toxicities of the study drug in the target population, and to determine&#xD;
      the MTD/OBD/ or recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D). The sample size employed is a minimally&#xD;
      modified standard 3+3 cohort model commonly used in Phase I oncology studies. Once&#xD;
      determined, the MTD/OBD/RP2D may be administered to an Expansion Cohort (Phase Ib) of&#xD;
      subjects with advanced PRL-3 expressing cancer.&#xD;
