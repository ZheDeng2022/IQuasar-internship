  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This project is a placebo-controlled, double-blind randomized trial evaluating the&#xD;
      feasibility, tolerability, acceptability and adherence for lorcaserin among actively using,&#xD;
      men who have sex with men (MSM) with cocaine use disorders.The study will enroll 45&#xD;
      individuals who will randomly be assigned to either the treatment (lorcaserin) arm or the&#xD;
      placebo arm, to be taken twice a day for 12 weeks.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 12-week parallel group pilot study&#xD;
      with 2:1 random assignment to 20 mg of extended-release oral lorcaserin versus placebo.&#xD;
      Participants are recruited via street outreach, recruitment flyers, STD and HIV clinics,&#xD;
      needle exchanges, community organizations, MSM bars, online Web sites, and social media.&#xD;
      Potential participants complete a brief telephone screen to assess initial eligibility and,&#xD;
      if eligible, are scheduled for an in-person screening visit. All participants give informed&#xD;
      consent using UCSF IRB-approved consent forms. A 10-item true/false questionnaire is used to&#xD;
      verify participants' understanding of the trial. The target sample size for the study was 45&#xD;
      participants. With this sample size, we estimate that proportions for our feasibility and&#xD;
      acceptability outcomes would be estimated within margins of sampling error (MSEs; i.e., half&#xD;
      widths of 95% confidence intervals) of ≤14.4 percentage points, and means with MSEs of 0.30&#xD;
      standard deviations, both typical for a small pilot study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants are screened for eligibility based on inclusion criteria. At Enrollment,&#xD;
      participants are instructed to take one pill each day of extended-release lorcarserin 20mg or&#xD;
      placebo. Medications are dispensed in bottles with MEMS caps, which are wireless medication&#xD;
      monitoring devices that record each opening as a real-time medication event. All participants&#xD;
      are asked about potential adverse events at each follow-up visit; symptom-driven physical&#xD;
      exams and safety laboratory monitoring are done at weeks 4, 8, and 12. Adverse events are&#xD;
      classified using the Division of AIDS (DAIDS) Table for Grading Severity of Adult Adverse&#xD;
      Experiences for HIV Prevention Trials Network. Participants are seen every week for substance&#xD;
      use counseling and urine tests for cocaine metabolites. Trained staff, supervised by a&#xD;
      clinical psychologist, administered brief (20-30 minutes) substance use counseling at&#xD;
      follow-up visits. Audio-computer assisted self-interviews (ACASI) are used to standardize&#xD;
      data collection and minimize reporting bias.[63, 64] Standardized measures are used to assess&#xD;
      drug and alcohol use using timeline followback, substance use treatment, craving and severity&#xD;
      of cocaine dependence, and sexual risk behavior.[13, 65-67] Acceptability measures include&#xD;
      questions on attitudes about trial participation, level of satisfaction with trial&#xD;
      procedures, and trial medication.&#xD;
