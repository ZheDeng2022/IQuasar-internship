    <textblock>
      This study evaluates efficacy of TAK- 228 and TAK- 117 followed by cisplatin and nab&#xD;
      paclitaxel in patients with metastatic triple negative breast cancer.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Seventy to eighty percent of breast cancers have a gene expression profile which is&#xD;
      characterized by homologous recombination deficiency (HRD) and high proliferation. HRD leads&#xD;
      to errors in DNA pathway [non -homologous end joining (NHEJ)] that repair DNA-breaks, a&#xD;
      process required for metastatic triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) survival. The hypothesis&#xD;
      of this pilot trial is that administration of the oral combination of TAK-228 and TAK-117&#xD;
      (PIKTOR) will inhibit NHEJ in metastatic TNBC, leading at the time of disease progression to&#xD;
      metastases that are HR-deficient and sensitive to cisplatin plus nab paclitaxel therapy.&#xD;
