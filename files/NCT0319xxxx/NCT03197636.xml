      An observational single center study designed to identify response-related biomarkers of&#xD;
      anti-programmed death 1 (PD-1) therapy to advanced melanoma patients and to investigate if&#xD;
      vitamin D levels are related to treatment response. 40 patients diagnosed with advanced&#xD;
      melanoma will be included. Patients are included at the Department of Oncology, Aarhus&#xD;
      University Hospital (AUH). All patients will be treated with Pembrolizumab as a standard&#xD;
      procedure at the Department of Oncology. The protocol comprises blood samples at baseline, 3&#xD;
      and 6 weeks after treatment initiation with anti-PD1 therapy and three years of observational&#xD;
      follow-up. A total amount of 217 ml blood will be drawn during the study period. The study&#xD;
      period is 6 weeks followed by 3 years of follow-up. Medical history, symptoms, response to&#xD;
      treatment regarding the RESIST criteria and side affects will be recorded at each visit in&#xD;
      both the study period and in follow-up. Biochemical markers will be obtained according to&#xD;
      normal procedure during study and follow-up visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      20 Healthy volunteers (HV) are included, matched by age and gender. Collected blood samples&#xD;
      (serum, plasma, peripheral blood mononuclear cells) will be analyzed after the last patient&#xD;
      has ended the week 6 visit.&#xD;

      Background Advanced melanoma still is associated with severe disease and early death. New&#xD;
      immunotherapies including the checkpoint inhibitors anti-PD-1 and anti-CTLA4 improve survival&#xD;
      compared to chemotherapy(1-3). It still remains to be elucidated why the treatment only&#xD;
      benefits some patients. The tumour cells expression of PD-L1 and other co-stimulatory&#xD;
      receptors, as well as the presence of soluble isoforms are speculated to influence treatment&#xD;
      success(4). Possible modulators of the PD-1 pathway like vitamin D might also influence the&#xD;
      treatment outcome. Investigating these relations could provide useful markers to predict&#xD;
      response to anti-PD-1 therapy in advanced melanoma patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Programmed Death 1 (PD-1), a transmembraneous molecule present on activated T, B and NK cells&#xD;
      is essential in maintaining self tolerance. PD-1 has two widely expressed ligands, PD-L1 and&#xD;
      PD-L2(5). Both PD-1 and its ligands are present in soluble (s) forms. In autoimmune disease&#xD;
      like rheumatoid arthritis sPD-1 concentrations are associated with disease markers and scores&#xD;
      (6).&#xD;
&#xD;
      PD-L1 can be highly expressed by cancers and thereby silence the T cell immune attack. Using&#xD;
      anti-PD-1 antibodies, the immune cells are not inhibited by the PD-1 pathway, and&#xD;
      proliferation, activation and T cell survival increases, improving tumour cells targeting&#xD;
      (7). Soluble PD-1, sPD-L1 and sPD-L2 may be potential markers in melanoma patients who would&#xD;
      benefit from the anti- PD1 treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In autoimmune diseases as rheumatoid arthritis(8), Crohn's disease(9) and in multiple&#xD;
      sclerosis (10) vitamin D deficiency is associated with increased disease activity. Active&#xD;
      1.25-dihydroxyviatmin D3 (1.25-vitD) binds to the vitamin D receptor (VDR) and the&#xD;
      1.25-vitD-VDR complex functions as a transcription factor. Regarding melanoma, VDR variants&#xD;
      are associated with melanoma risk (11). In mice, vitamin D stimulation has been shown to&#xD;
      increase the PD-L2 expression in DCs(12). In humans vitamin D stimulation increased the DC&#xD;
      PD-L1 expression and IL-10 production and PD-L1 blockage resulted in increased interferon&#xD;
      gamma and decreased IL-10 production(13).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our preliminary pilot studies have demonstrated that vitamin D initially decreases PD-1&#xD;
      expression in Crohn's disease T cells but after 26 weeks of vitamin D treatment PD-1&#xD;
      expression increases in CD4+CD25+ T cells (unpublished data). These results might indicate&#xD;
      that vitamin D treatment initially increase T cell activation replaced by a decreased T cell&#xD;
      activation after long-time vitamin D treatment in inflamed patients. This might influence the&#xD;
      anti-PD-1 treatment response in advanced melanoma. Improved knowledge of the interaction&#xD;
      between anti-PD-1treatment, vitamin-D and sPD-1, PD-L1 and PD-L2 could provide new beneficial&#xD;
      modifications to the treatment regimens currently available -for instance as a new predictor&#xD;
      of treatment response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To investigate if the concentrations of sPD1, sPDL1, sPDL2 are associated with the&#xD;
           initial response of anti-PD1 therapy in patients with advanced melanoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To examine if vitamin D levels influence the initial anti-PD-1 therapy treatment&#xD;
           response in advanced melanoma&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To detect how anti-PD-1, sPD-1, sPD-L2, sPD-L1 and vitamin D affect PD-1 and vitamin D&#xD;
           related surface-markers, cytokines and mRNA expressions in peripheral blood mononuclear&#xD;
           cells in advanced melanoma during the first 6 weeks of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To investigate if the concentrations of sPD1, sPDL1, sPDL2 are associated with the&#xD;
           long-term response to anti-PD1 therapy in patients with advanced melanoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. To examine if vitamin D levels influence the long-term anti-PD-1 therapy treatment&#xD;
           response in advanced melanoma&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods and participants Advanced melanoma patients 40 patients diagnosed with advanced&#xD;
      melanoma will be included in the present observational study designed to identify&#xD;
      response-related biomarkers of anti-PD-1 therapy. Patients are included at the Department of&#xD;
      Oncology, Aarhus University Hospital (AUH). The protocol is approved by the Central Denmark&#xD;
      Regional Committee for Health Research Ethics and the Danish Data Protection Agency. The&#xD;
      protocol comprises blood samples at baseline, 3 and 6 weeks after treatment initiation with&#xD;
      anti-PD1 therapy. The study period is 6 weeks followed by 3 years of follow-up. Medical&#xD;
      history and symptoms and serious immune side affects will be recorded at each visit in both&#xD;
      the study period and in follow-up. Standard biochemical markers will be obtained according to&#xD;
      guidelines during follow-up and will be independent of the project. Patients are follow-up&#xD;
      every third week during the anti-PD-1 treatment. The treatment is stopped because of disease&#xD;
      progression or server adverse events. After ended anti-PD-1 treatment patients are&#xD;
      followed-up every 3rd month. The follow-up visits are used to detect time to treatment&#xD;
      response and time to treatment failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The included persons do not receive economic compensation for participating in the project.&#xD;
      Aim one to three will be investigated when all patients have ended the study period of 6&#xD;
      weeks. Aim five and six will be investigated when all patients have ended the follow-up&#xD;
      period&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy volunteers 20 Healthy volunteers (HV) are included as controls, matched by age and&#xD;
      gender. Matched HV are obtained from buffy coats, an established collaboration with the Blood&#xD;
      Bank, Aarhus University Hospital. It is not possible to trace the identity of a donor to a&#xD;
      specific blood sample.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells From advanced melanoma patients 36 ml of blood are&#xD;
      collected at baseline and after 6 weeks of therapy (a total of 72 ml). From HV, blood from&#xD;
      the buffy coat is used. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) are isolated with ficoll,&#xD;
      an established protocol. PBMCs are cryopreserved at -140C and stored in the INART bio bank of&#xD;
      Biomedicine, Aarhus University. The PBMCs are used to investigate expression of&#xD;
      co-stimulatory molecules; among these PD-1, PD-L1, PD-L2, CTLA-4, activation markers, cell&#xD;
      proliferation, cell viability, cytokine production as well as vitamin D related cell markers&#xD;
      together with mRNA expressions of vitamin D and Pd-1 related genes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Plasma and Serum At baseline and after 3 and 6 weeks of therapy 18 ml of blood are obtained&#xD;
      to isolate serum and plasma (a total of 54 ml blood). Plasma and serum from HV are obtained&#xD;
      from the buffy coat. Plasma and serum is isolated, cryopreserved at -80C and stored in the&#xD;
      INART bio bank of Biomedicine, Aarhus University. In plasma, sPD-1, sPD-L1, sPD-L2 and CTLA-4&#xD;
      concentrations with more are determined.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study-related biochemical markers At baseline and after 6 weeks of initial treatment a total&#xD;
      amount of 55 ml of blood are used for the following blood samples: 25-hydroxyvitamin D2+D3,&#xD;
      1.25-dihydroxyvitamin D3, Parathyroid hormone, free calcium-ion and phosphate. Vitamin D&#xD;
      binding protein concentration is measured at baseline. All the listed blood samples despite&#xD;
      vitamin D binding protein concentration are measured as a standard operation procedure by the&#xD;
      Clinical Biochemistry department at Aarhus University Hospital. Vitamin D binding protein&#xD;
      concentrations are measured at Statens Serum Institut a public enterprise under the Danish&#xD;
      Ministry of Health.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Melanoma cell line The patient data will be supported by in vitro experiments using a&#xD;
      melanoma cell line. PD-1 and vitamin D related surface markers, cytokine production and mRNA&#xD;
      expressions will be associated to anti-PD-1 therapy, sPD-1, sPD-L1, sPD-L1 and vitamin D.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistics ELISA-made results (sPD-1, sPD-L1, sPD-L2, sCLTA-4) are presented as median with&#xD;
      total range and differences are calculated using Wilcoxon non-parametric statistics. Other&#xD;
      results are examined for normal distribution. Normal distributed data are compared with&#xD;
      student's t-test and non-normal distributed data are compared with Wilcoxon non-parametric&#xD;
      statistics. Association between two variables will be estimated using Spearman's rank&#xD;
      correlation coefficient (Spearman's rho). A p-value below 0.05 will be considered&#xD;
      statistically significant.&#xD;
