  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study determined the effects of different doses and dosing regimens of ESN364 on the&#xD;
      frequency and severity of hot flashes. The treatment was administered for 12 weeks to&#xD;
      postmenopausal women, aged 40 to 65, suffering at least 50 moderate to severe hot flashes per&#xD;
      week.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This was a 12-week randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-ranging,&#xD;
      parallel-group, multi-center study to assess the efficacy of ESN364 in postmenopausal women&#xD;
      suffering from vasomotor symptoms (hot flashes).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study consisted of a screening period (Days -35 to -1, including the screening visit&#xD;
      [Visit 1] and a minimum 7-day collection of baseline vasomotor symptom frequency and severity&#xD;
      assessments), a 12 week treatment period (Day 1 [Visit 2] to Week 12 [Visit 5]), and a follow&#xD;
      up visit (Week 15 [Visit 6]) 3 weeks after the last dose of study drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study was performed on an ambulatory basis. The screening visit (Visit 1) occurred up to&#xD;
      35 days prior to randomization. Eligibility was assessed via physical examination, clinical&#xD;
      laboratory testing, vital signs, ECG, Pap smear, mammography, and endometrial biopsy.&#xD;
      Subjects received an electronic diary to record daily vasomotor symptoms during the duration&#xD;
      of the screening period. Subjects who had ≥7 consecutive days of vasomotor symptom recordings&#xD;
      participated in the study. Subjects are encouraged to continue recording for the duration of&#xD;
      the whole screening period. The electronic diary was reviewed by study site staff on Day 1&#xD;
      (Visit 2) to confirm study eligibility. Subjects were rescreened 1 time upon approval of the&#xD;
      medical monitor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the treatment period, subjects returned to the study site every 4 weeks for&#xD;
      assessments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The follow-up visit occurred approximately 3 weeks following the last dose of study drug.&#xD;

    <measure>Co-Primary Efficacy Endpoint: Change From Baseline (CFB) in The Mean Frequency of Moderate to Severe Vasomotor Symptoms (VMS) at Week 4</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and week 4</time_frame>
    <description>The frequency of moderate to severe VMS was the number of moderate to severe VMS per 24 hours. A daily frequency and severity per week was derived by taking the mean of the data over 7 days. Moderate VMS was defined as sensation of heat with sweating/dampness, but was able to continue activity. If at night, participant woke up because she was feeling hot and/or was sweating, but no action was necessary other than rearranging the bed sheets. Severe VMS was defined as sensation of intense heat with sweating, caused disruption of activity. If at night, participant woke up hot and was sweating and needed to take action (e.g., remove layers of clothes, open the window, or get out of bed).</description>

    <description>The frequency of mild, moderate and severe VMS was the number of mild, moderate and severe VMS per 24 hours. A daily frequency and severity per week was derived by taking the mean of the data over 7 days. Mild VMS was defined as sensation of heat without sweating/dampness. If at night, participant does not wake up but later notices damp sheets or clothing. Moderate VMS was defined as sensation of heat with sweating/dampness, but was able to continue activity. If at night, participant woke up because she was feeling hot and/or was sweating, but no action was necessary other than rearranging the bed sheets. Severe VMS was defined as sensation of intense heat with sweating, caused disruption of activity. If at night, participant woke up hot and was sweating and needed to take action (e.g., remove layers of clothes, open the window, or get out of bed).</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Hot Flash-Related Daily Interference Scale (HFRDIS) at Weeks 4, 8, 12, and 15</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and weeks 4, 8, 12, and 15</time_frame>
    <description>The HFRDIS is a 10-item scale that measures a woman's perceptions of the degree to which VMS interfere with 9 daily life activities (work, social activities, leisure, sleep, mood, concentration, relations with others, sexuality, and enjoying life); the tenth item measures interference with overall quality of life. This scale was modeled after items on the Brief Pain Inventory and Brief Fatigue Inventory, which assess the extent to which pain or fatigue interfere with daily life. Participants were asked to rate the extent to which VMS had interfered with each item during the previous 2-week time interval using a 0 (do not interfere) to 10 (completely interfere) scale. Overall mean score is the average of individual item scores (sum of items/10).</description>

    <time_frame>Weeks 4, 8, 12, and 15</time_frame>
    <description>The LSEQ is a 10-item self-rated questionnaire that assesses a participants aspects of sleep and early morning behavior. The questions are grouped into 4 chronological areas: ease of getting to sleep, perceived quality of sleep, ease of awaking from sleep, and integrity of early morning behavior following wakefulness. The LSEQ is a visual analog scale that requires respondents to place marks on a group of 10 cm lines. Lines extend between extremes like &quot;more difficult than usual&quot; and &quot;easier than usual.&quot; Responses are measured using a 100 mm scale and are averaged to a score for each domain. Higher scores indicates better sleep and better early morning behavior.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline and weeks 4, 8, 12, and 15</time_frame>
    <description>The GCS is a 21-item scale that provides a brief but comprehensive and valid measure of climacteric symptomatology. Each item is rated by the participant according to its severity using a 4-point rating scale from 0 (none) to 3 (severe). The first 20 items of the scale combine into 3 main independent symptom measures by summing up the individual item scores: psychological symptoms (items 1 to 11; score 0 to 33), physical symptoms (items 12 to 18; score 0 to 21), and VMS (items 19 to 20; score 0 to 6). Item 21 is a probe for sexual dysfunction. The total score can range from 0 to 63. Higher scores indicate worse symptoms.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Menopause-Specific Quality of Life (MENQoL) at Weeks 4, 8, 12, and 15</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and weeks 4, 8, 12, and 15</time_frame>
    <description>The MENQoL is self-administered and consists of a total of 29 items in a Likert-scale format. Each item assesses the impact of 1 of 4 domains of menopausal symptoms, as experienced over the last month: vasomotor (items 1 to 3), psychosocial (items 4 to 10), physical (items 11 to 26), and sexual (items 27 to 29). Items pertaining to a specific symptom are rated as present or not present, and if present, how bothersome on a 0 (not bothersome) to 6 (extremely bothersome) scale. Means are computed for each subscale by dividing the sum of the domain's items by the number of items within that domain. Non-endorsement of an item is scored a &quot;1&quot; and endorsement a &quot;2,&quot; plus the number of the particular rating, so that the possible score on any item ranges from 1 to 8. Higher scores indicate that menopause symptoms are more bothersome.</description>

        <title>Co-Primary Efficacy Endpoint: Change From Baseline (CFB) in The Mean Frequency of Moderate to Severe Vasomotor Symptoms (VMS) at Week 4</title>
        <description>The frequency of moderate to severe VMS was the number of moderate to severe VMS per 24 hours. A daily frequency and severity per week was derived by taking the mean of the data over 7 days. Moderate VMS was defined as sensation of heat with sweating/dampness, but was able to continue activity. If at night, participant woke up because she was feeling hot and/or was sweating, but no action was necessary other than rearranging the bed sheets. Severe VMS was defined as sensation of intense heat with sweating, caused disruption of activity. If at night, participant woke up hot and was sweating and needed to take action (e.g., remove layers of clothes, open the window, or get out of bed).</description>

        <title>Co-Primary Efficacy Endpoint: Change From Baseline in The Mean Frequency of Moderate to Severe VMS at Week 12</title>
        <description>The frequency of moderate to severe VMS was the number of moderate to severe VMS per 24 hours. A daily frequency and severity per week was derived by taking the mean of the data over 7 days. Moderate VMS was defined as sensation of heat with sweating/dampness, but was able to continue activity. If at night, participant woke up because she was feeling hot and/or was sweating, but no action was necessary other than rearranging the bed sheets. Severe VMS was defined as sensation of intense heat with sweating, caused disruption of activity. If at night, participant woke up hot and was sweating and needed to take action (e.g., remove layers of clothes, open the window, or get out of bed).</description>

        <title>Co-Primary Efficacy Endpoint: Change From Baseline in The Mean Severity of Moderate to Severe VMS at Week 12</title>
        <description>Severity of moderate to severe VMS per day was calculated as follows:&#xD;
[(number of moderate VMS × 2) + (number of severe VMS × 3)]/number of daily moderate/severe VMS.&#xD;
Moderate VMS was defined as sensation of heat with sweating/dampness, but was able to continue activity. If at night, participant woke up because she was feeling hot and/or was sweating, but no action was necessary other than rearranging the bed sheets. Severe VMS was defined as sensation of intense heat with sweating, caused disruption of activity. If at night, participant woke up hot and was sweating and needed to take action (e.g., remove layers of clothes, open the window, or get out of bed).&#xD;
Severity was zero for participants that had no moderate or severe VMS. Higher scores indicates greater severity.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in The Mean Frequency of Mild, Moderate, and Severe VMS to Each Study Week</title>
        <description>The frequency of mild, moderate and severe VMS was the number of mild, moderate and severe VMS per 24 hours. A daily frequency and severity per week was derived by taking the mean of the data over 7 days. Mild VMS was defined as sensation of heat without sweating/dampness. If at night, subject does not wake up but later notices damp sheets or clothing. Moderate VMS was defined as sensation of heat with sweating/dampness, but was able to continue activity. If at night, participant woke up because she was feeling hot and/or was sweating, but no action was necessary other than rearranging the bed sheets. Severe VMS was defined as sensation of intense heat with sweating, caused disruption of activity. If at night, participant woke up hot and was sweating and needed to take action (e.g., remove layers of clothes, open the window, or get out of bed).</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in The Mean Frequency of Moderate and Severe VMS to Each Study Week</title>
        <description>The frequency of moderate to severe VMS was the number of moderate to severe VMS per 24 hours. A daily frequency and severity per week was derived by taking the mean of the data over 7 days. Moderate VMS was defined as sensation of heat with sweating/dampness, but was able to continue activity. If at night, participant woke up because she was feeling hot and/or was sweating, but no action was necessary other than rearranging the bed sheets. Severe VMS was defined as sensation of intense heat with sweating, caused disruption of activity. If at night, participant woke up hot and was sweating and needed to take action (e.g., remove layers of clothes, open the window, or get out of bed).</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in The Mean Severity of Mild, Moderate, and Severe VMS to Each Study Week</title>
        <description>Severity of mild, moderate &amp; severe VMS per day was calculated as follows&#xD;
[(number of mild VMS × 1) + (number of moderate VMS × 2) + (number of severe VMS × 3)]/number of daily mild/moderate/severe VMS&#xD;
Mild VMS was defined as sensation of heat without sweating/dampness. If at night, participant did not wake up but later noticed damp sheets or clothing. Moderate VMS was defined as sensation of heat with sweating/dampness, but was able to continue activity. If at night, participant woke up because she was feeling hot and/or was sweating, but no action was necessary other than rearranging the bed sheets. Severe VMS was defined as sensation of intense heat with sweating, caused disruption of activity. If at night, participant woke up hot &amp; was sweating &amp; needed to take action Severity was zero for participants that had no moderate or severe VMS. Higher score indicates greater severity.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in The Mean Severity of Moderate and Severe VMS to Each Study Week</title>
        <description>Severity of moderate to severe VMS per day was calculated as follows:&#xD;
[(number of moderate VMS × 2) + (number of severe VMS × 3)]/number of daily moderate/severe VMS.&#xD;
Moderate VMS was defined as sensation of heat with sweating/dampness, but was able to continue activity. If at night, participant woke up because she was feeling hot and/or was sweating, but no action was necessary other than rearranging the bed sheets. Severe VMS was defined as sensation of intense heat with sweating, caused disruption of activity. If at night, participant woke up hot and was sweating and needed to take action (e.g., remove layers of clothes, open the window, or get out of bed). Severity was zero for patients that had no moderate or severe VMS. Higher score indicates greater severity.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in The Hot Flash Score of Mild, Moderate, and Severe VMS to Each Study Week</title>
        <description>The hot flash score per 24h (or 12 h day time or 12 h night time) of VMS (mild, moderate, and severe) is calculated as follows:&#xD;
(number of mild VMS x 1) + (number of moderate VMS x 2) + (number of severe VMS x 3).&#xD;
Mild VMS was defined as sensation of heat without sweating/dampness. If at night, participant did not wake up but later noticed damp sheets or clothing.&#xD;
Moderate VMS was defined as sensation of heat with sweating/dampness, but was able to continue activity. If at night, participant woke up because she was feeling hot and/or was sweating, but no action was necessary other than rearranging the bed sheets. Severe VMS was defined as sensation of intense heat with sweating, caused disruption of activity. If at night, participant woke up hot and was sweating and needed to take action (e.g., remove layers of clothes, open the window, or get out of bed). Higher score indicates greater severity.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in The Hot Flash Score of Moderate and Severe VMS to Each Study Week</title>
        <description>The hot flash score per 24h of moderate and severe VMS is calculated as follows:&#xD;
(number of moderate VMS x 2) + (number of severe VMS x 3).&#xD;
Moderate VMS was defined as sensation of heat with sweating/dampness, but was able to continue activity. If at night, participant woke up because she was feeling hot and/or was sweating, but no action was necessary other than rearranging the bed sheets. Severe VMS was defined as sensation of intense heat with sweating, caused disruption of activity. If at night, participant woke up hot and was sweating and needed to take action (e.g., remove layers of clothes, open the window, or get out of bed). VMS. Baseline is the average frequency of 24h vasomotor symptom from 7 non-missing days prior to Day 1. Higher score indicates greater severity.</description>

          <title>Change From Baseline in The Hot Flash Score of Moderate and Severe VMS to Each Study Week</title>
          <description>The hot flash score per 24h of moderate and severe VMS is calculated as follows:&#xD;
(number of moderate VMS x 2) + (number of severe VMS x 3).&#xD;
Moderate VMS was defined as sensation of heat with sweating/dampness, but was able to continue activity. If at night, participant woke up because she was feeling hot and/or was sweating, but no action was necessary other than rearranging the bed sheets. Severe VMS was defined as sensation of intense heat with sweating, caused disruption of activity. If at night, participant woke up hot and was sweating and needed to take action (e.g., remove layers of clothes, open the window, or get out of bed). VMS. Baseline is the average frequency of 24h vasomotor symptom from 7 non-missing days prior to Day 1. Higher score indicates greater severity.</description>

        <title>Mean Percent Reduction of Mild, Moderate, And Severe Vasomotor Symptoms From Baseline to Each Study Week</title>
        <description>The frequency of mild, moderate and severe VMS was the number of mild, moderate and severe VMS per 24 hours. A daily frequency and severity per week was derived by taking the mean of the data over 7 days. Mild VMS was defined as sensation of heat without sweating/dampness. If at night, subject does not wake up but later notices damp sheets or clothing. Moderate VMS was defined as sensation of heat with sweating/dampness, but was able to continue activity. If at night, participant woke up because she was feeling hot and/or was sweating, but no action was necessary other than rearranging the bed sheets. Severe VMS was defined as sensation of intense heat with sweating, caused disruption of activity. If at night, participant woke up hot and was sweating and needed to take action (e.g., remove layers of clothes, open the window, or get out of bed).</description>

        <title>Mean Percent Reduction of Moderate And Severe Vasomotor Symptoms From Baseline to Each Study Week</title>
        <description>The frequency of moderate to severe VMS was the number of moderate to severe VMS per 24 hours. A daily frequency and severity per week was derived by taking the mean of the data over 7 days. Moderate VMS was defined as sensation of heat with sweating/dampness, but was able to continue activity. If at night, participant woke up because she was feeling hot and/or was sweating, but no action was necessary other than rearranging the bed sheets. Severe VMS was defined as sensation of intense heat with sweating, caused disruption of activity. If at night, participant woke up hot and was sweating and needed to take action (e.g., remove layers of clothes, open the window, or get out of bed).</description>

        <title>Number of Participants With Mean Percent Reduction of 50% in The Mean Frequency of Mild, Moderate, and Severe VMS From Baseline to Each Study Week</title>
        <description>The frequency of mild, moderate and severe VMS was the number of mild, moderate and severe VMS per 24 hours. A daily frequency and severity per week was derived by taking the mean of the data over 7 days. Mild VMS was defined as sensation of heat without sweating/dampness. If at night, participant does not wake up but later notices damp sheets or clothing. Moderate VMS was defined as sensation of heat with sweating/dampness, but was able to continue activity. If at night, participant woke up because she was feeling hot and/or was sweating, but no action was necessary other than rearranging the bed sheets. Severe VMS was defined as sensation of intense heat with sweating, caused disruption of activity. If at night, participant woke up hot and was sweating and needed to take action (e.g., remove layers of clothes, open the window, or get out of bed).</description>

        <title>Number of Participants With Mean Percent Reduction of 70% in The Mean Frequency of Mild, Moderate, and Severe VMS From Baseline to Each Study Week</title>
        <description>The frequency of mild, moderate and severe VMS was the number of mild, moderate and severe VMS per 24 hours. A daily frequency and severity per week was derived by taking the mean of the data over 7 days. Mild VMS was defined as sensation of heat without sweating/dampness. If at night, participant does not wake up but later notices damp sheets or clothing. Moderate VMS was defined as sensation of heat with sweating/dampness, but was able to continue activity. If at night, participant woke up because she was feeling hot and/or was sweating, but no action was necessary other than rearranging the bed sheets. Severe VMS was defined as sensation of intense heat with sweating, caused disruption of activity. If at night, participant woke up hot and was sweating and needed to take action (e.g., remove layers of clothes, open the window, or get out of bed).</description>

        <title>Number of Participants With Mean Percent Reduction of 90% in The Mean Frequency of Mild, Moderate, and Severe VMS From Baseline to Each Study Week</title>
        <description>The frequency of mild, moderate and severe VMS was the number of mild, moderate and severe VMS per 24 hours. A daily frequency and severity per week was derived by taking the mean of the data over 7 days. Mild VMS was defined as sensation of heat without sweating/dampness. If at night, participant does not wake up but later notices damp sheets or clothing. Moderate VMS was defined as sensation of heat with sweating/dampness, but was able to continue activity. If at night, participant woke up because she was feeling hot and/or was sweating, but no action was necessary other than rearranging the bed sheets. Severe VMS was defined as sensation of intense heat with sweating, caused disruption of activity. If at night, participant woke up hot and was sweating and needed to take action (e.g., remove layers of clothes, open the window, or get out of bed).</description>

        <title>Number of Participants With Mean Percent Reduction of 100% in The Mean Frequency of Mild, Moderate, and Severe VMS From Baseline to Each Study Week</title>
        <description>The frequency of mild, moderate and severe VMS was the number of mild, moderate and severe VMS per 24 hours. A daily frequency and severity per week was derived by taking the mean of the data over 7 days. Mild VMS was defined as sensation of heat without sweating/dampness. If at night, participant does not wake up but later notices damp sheets or clothing. Moderate VMS was defined as sensation of heat with sweating/dampness, but was able to continue activity. If at night, participant woke up because she was feeling hot and/or was sweating, but no action was necessary other than rearranging the bed sheets. Severe VMS was defined as sensation of intense heat with sweating, caused disruption of activity. If at night, participant woke up hot and was sweating and needed to take action (e.g., remove layers of clothes, open the window, or get out of bed).</description>

        <title>Number of Participants With Mean Percent Reduction of 50% in The Mean Frequency of Moderate and Severe Vasomotor Symptoms From Baseline to Each Study Week</title>
        <description>The frequency of moderate to severe VMS was the number of moderate to severe VMS per 24 hours. A daily frequency and severity per week was derived by taking the mean of the data over 7 days. Moderate VMS was defined as sensation of heat with sweating/dampness, but was able to continue activity. If at night, participant woke up because she was feeling hot and/or was sweating, but no action was necessary other than rearranging the bed sheets. Severe VMS was defined as sensation of intense heat with sweating, caused disruption of activity. If at night, participant woke up hot and was sweating and needed to take action (e.g., remove layers of clothes, open the window, or get out of bed).</description>

        <title>Number of Participants With Mean Percent Reduction of 70% in The Mean Frequency of Moderate and Severe Vasomotor Symptoms From Baseline to Each Study Week</title>
        <description>The frequency of moderate to severe VMS was the number of moderate to severe VMS per 24 hours. A daily frequency and severity per week was derived by taking the mean of the data over 7 days. Moderate VMS was defined as sensation of heat with sweating/dampness, but was able to continue activity. If at night, participant woke up because she was feeling hot and/or was sweating, but no action was necessary other than rearranging the bed sheets. Severe VMS was defined as sensation of intense heat with sweating, caused disruption of activity. If at night, participant woke up hot and was sweating and needed to take action (e.g., remove layers of clothes, open the window, or get out of bed).</description>

        <title>Number of Participants With Mean Percent Reduction of 90% in The Mean Frequency of Moderate and Severe Vasomotor Symptoms From Baseline to Each Study Week</title>
        <description>The frequency of moderate to severe VMS was the number of moderate to severe VMS per 24 hours. A daily frequency and severity per week was derived by taking the mean of the data over 7 days. Moderate VMS was defined as sensation of heat with sweating/dampness, but was able to continue activity. If at night, participant woke up because she was feeling hot and/or was sweating, but no action was necessary other than rearranging the bed sheets. Severe VMS was defined as sensation of intense heat with sweating, caused disruption of activity. If at night, participant woke up hot and was sweating and needed to take action (e.g., remove layers of clothes, open the window, or get out of bed).</description>

          <title>Number of Participants With Mean Percent Reduction of 90% in The Mean Frequency of Moderate and Severe Vasomotor Symptoms From Baseline to Each Study Week</title>
          <description>The frequency of moderate to severe VMS was the number of moderate to severe VMS per 24 hours. A daily frequency and severity per week was derived by taking the mean of the data over 7 days. Moderate VMS was defined as sensation of heat with sweating/dampness, but was able to continue activity. If at night, participant woke up because she was feeling hot and/or was sweating, but no action was necessary other than rearranging the bed sheets. Severe VMS was defined as sensation of intense heat with sweating, caused disruption of activity. If at night, participant woke up hot and was sweating and needed to take action (e.g., remove layers of clothes, open the window, or get out of bed).</description>

        <title>Number of Participants With Mean Percent Reduction of 100% in The Mean Frequency of Moderate and Severe Vasomotor Symptoms From Baseline to Each Study Week</title>
        <description>The frequency of moderate to severe VMS was the number of moderate to severe VMS per 24 hours. A daily frequency and severity per week was derived by taking the mean of the data over 7 days. Moderate VMS was defined as sensation of heat with sweating/dampness, but was able to continue activity. If at night, participant woke up because she was feeling hot and/or was sweating, but no action was necessary other than rearranging the bed sheets. Severe VMS was defined as sensation of intense heat with sweating, caused disruption of activity. If at night, participant woke up hot and was sweating and needed to take action (e.g., remove layers of clothes, open the window, or get out of bed).</description>

        <title>Number of Participants With Absolute Reduction of 2 in Mean Number of Mild, Moderate and Severe VMS Per Day From Baseline to Each Study Week</title>
        <description>The frequency of mild, moderate and severe VMS was the number of mild, moderate and severe VMS per 24 hours. A daily frequency and severity per week was derived by taking the mean of the data over 7 days. Mild VMS was defined as sensation of heat without sweating/dampness. If at night, participant does not wake up but later notices damp sheets or clothing. Moderate VMS was defined as sensation of heat with sweating/dampness, but was able to continue activity. If at night, participant woke up because she was feeling hot and/or was sweating, but no action was necessary other than rearranging the bed sheets. Severe VMS was defined as sensation of intense heat with sweating, caused disruption of activity. If at night, participant woke up hot and was sweating and needed to take action (e.g., remove layers of clothes, open the window, or get out of bed).</description>

        <title>Number of Participants With Absolute Reduction of 3 in Mean Number of Mild, Moderate and Severe VMS Per Day From Baseline to Each Study Week</title>
        <description>The frequency of mild, moderate and severe VMS was the number of mild, moderate and severe VMS per 24 hours. A daily frequency and severity per week was derived by taking the mean of the data over 7 days. Mild VMS was defined as sensation of heat without sweating/dampness. If at night, participant does not wake up but later notices damp sheets or clothing. Moderate VMS was defined as sensation of heat with sweating/dampness, but was able to continue activity. If at night, participant woke up because she was feeling hot and/or was sweating, but no action was necessary other than rearranging the bed sheets. Severe VMS was defined as sensation of intense heat with sweating, caused disruption of activity. If at night, participant woke up hot and was sweating and needed to take action (e.g., remove layers of clothes, open the window, or get out of bed).</description>

        <title>Number of Participants With Absolute Reduction of 4 in Mean Number of Mild, Moderate and Severe VMS Per Day From Baseline to Each Study Week</title>
        <description>The frequency of mild, moderate and severe VMS was the number of mild, moderate and severe VMS per 24 hours. A daily frequency and severity per week was derived by taking the mean of the data over 7 days. Mild VMS was defined as sensation of heat without sweating/dampness. If at night, participant does not wake up but later notices damp sheets or clothing. Moderate VMS was defined as sensation of heat with sweating/dampness, but was able to continue activity. If at night, participant woke up because she was feeling hot and/or was sweating, but no action was necessary other than rearranging the bed sheets. Severe VMS was defined as sensation of intense heat with sweating, caused disruption of activity. If at night, participant woke up hot and was sweating and needed to take action (e.g., remove layers of clothes, open the window, or get out of bed).</description>

        <title>Number of Participants With Absolute Reduction of 5 in Mean Number of Mild, Moderate and Severe VMS Per Day From Baseline to Each Study Week</title>
        <description>The frequency of mild, moderate and severe VMS was the number of mild, moderate and severe VMS per 24 hours. A daily frequency and severity per week was derived by taking the mean of the data over 7 days. Mild VMS was defined as sensation of heat without sweating/dampness. If at night, participant does not wake up but later notices damp sheets or clothing. Moderate VMS was defined as sensation of heat with sweating/dampness, but was able to continue activity. If at night, participant woke up because she was feeling hot and/or was sweating, but no action was necessary other than rearranging the bed sheets. Severe VMS was defined as sensation of intense heat with sweating, caused disruption of activity. If at night, participant woke up hot and was sweating and needed to take action (e.g., remove layers of clothes, open the window, or get out of bed).</description>

          <title>Number of Participants With Absolute Reduction of 5 in Mean Number of Mild, Moderate and Severe VMS Per Day From Baseline to Each Study Week</title>
          <description>The frequency of mild, moderate and severe VMS was the number of mild, moderate and severe VMS per 24 hours. A daily frequency and severity per week was derived by taking the mean of the data over 7 days. Mild VMS was defined as sensation of heat without sweating/dampness. If at night, participant does not wake up but later notices damp sheets or clothing. Moderate VMS was defined as sensation of heat with sweating/dampness, but was able to continue activity. If at night, participant woke up because she was feeling hot and/or was sweating, but no action was necessary other than rearranging the bed sheets. Severe VMS was defined as sensation of intense heat with sweating, caused disruption of activity. If at night, participant woke up hot and was sweating and needed to take action (e.g., remove layers of clothes, open the window, or get out of bed).</description>

        <title>Number of Participants With Absolute Reduction of 2 in Mean Number of Moderate and Severe VMS Per Day From Baseline to Each Study Week</title>
        <description>The frequency of moderate to severe VMS was the number of moderate to severe VMS per 24 hours. A daily frequency and severity per week was derived by taking the mean of the data over 7 days. Moderate VMS was defined as sensation of heat with sweating/dampness, but was able to continue activity. If at night, participant woke up because she was feeling hot and/or was sweating, but no action was necessary other than rearranging the bed sheets. Severe VMS was defined as sensation of intense heat with sweating, caused disruption of activity. If at night, participant woke up hot and was sweating and needed to take action (e.g., remove layers of clothes, open the window, or get out of bed).</description>

        <title>Number of Participants With Absolute Reduction of 3 in Mean Number of Moderate and Severe VMS Per Day From Baseline to Each Study Week</title>
        <description>The frequency of moderate to severe VMS was the number of moderate to severe VMS per 24 hours. A daily frequency and severity per week was derived by taking the mean of the data over 7 days. Moderate VMS was defined as sensation of heat with sweating/dampness, but was able to continue activity. If at night, participant woke up because she was feeling hot and/or was sweating, but no action was necessary other than rearranging the bed sheets. Severe VMS was defined as sensation of intense heat with sweating, caused disruption of activity. If at night, participant woke up hot and was sweating and needed to take action (e.g., remove layers of clothes, open the window, or get out of bed).</description>

          <title>Number of Participants With Absolute Reduction of 3 in Mean Number of Moderate and Severe VMS Per Day From Baseline to Each Study Week</title>
          <description>The frequency of moderate to severe VMS was the number of moderate to severe VMS per 24 hours. A daily frequency and severity per week was derived by taking the mean of the data over 7 days. Moderate VMS was defined as sensation of heat with sweating/dampness, but was able to continue activity. If at night, participant woke up because she was feeling hot and/or was sweating, but no action was necessary other than rearranging the bed sheets. Severe VMS was defined as sensation of intense heat with sweating, caused disruption of activity. If at night, participant woke up hot and was sweating and needed to take action (e.g., remove layers of clothes, open the window, or get out of bed).</description>

        <title>Number of Participants With Absolute Reduction of 4 in Mean Number of Moderate and Severe VMS Per Day From Baseline to Each Study Week</title>
        <description>The frequency of moderate to severe VMS was the number of moderate to severe VMS per 24 hours. A daily frequency and severity per week was derived by taking the mean of the data over 7 days. Moderate VMS was defined as sensation of heat with sweating/dampness, but was able to continue activity. If at night, participant woke up because she was feeling hot and/or was sweating, but no action was necessary other than rearranging the bed sheets. Severe VMS was defined as sensation of intense heat with sweating, caused disruption of activity. If at night, participant woke up hot and was sweating and needed to take action (e.g., remove layers of clothes, open the window, or get out of bed).</description>

          <title>Number of Participants With Absolute Reduction of 4 in Mean Number of Moderate and Severe VMS Per Day From Baseline to Each Study Week</title>
          <description>The frequency of moderate to severe VMS was the number of moderate to severe VMS per 24 hours. A daily frequency and severity per week was derived by taking the mean of the data over 7 days. Moderate VMS was defined as sensation of heat with sweating/dampness, but was able to continue activity. If at night, participant woke up because she was feeling hot and/or was sweating, but no action was necessary other than rearranging the bed sheets. Severe VMS was defined as sensation of intense heat with sweating, caused disruption of activity. If at night, participant woke up hot and was sweating and needed to take action (e.g., remove layers of clothes, open the window, or get out of bed).</description>

        <title>Number of Participants With Absolute Reduction of 5 in Mean Number of Moderate and Severe VMS Per Day From Baseline to Each Study Week</title>
        <description>The frequency of moderate to severe VMS was the number of moderate to severe VMS per 24 hours. A daily frequency and severity per week was derived by taking the mean of the data over 7 days. Moderate VMS was defined as sensation of heat with sweating/dampness, but was able to continue activity. If at night, participant woke up because she was feeling hot and/or was sweating, but no action was necessary other than rearranging the bed sheets. Severe VMS was defined as sensation of intense heat with sweating, caused disruption of activity. If at night, participant woke up hot and was sweating and needed to take action (e.g., remove layers of clothes, open the window, or get out of bed).</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Hot Flash-Related Daily Interference Scale (HFRDIS) at Weeks 4, 8, 12, and 15</title>
        <description>The HFRDIS is a 10-item scale that measures a woman's perceptions of the degree to which VMS interfere with 9 daily life activities (work, social activities, leisure, sleep, mood, concentration, relations with others, sexuality, and enjoying life); the tenth item measures interference with overall quality of life. This scale was modeled after items on the Brief Pain Inventory and Brief Fatigue Inventory, which assess the extent to which pain or fatigue interfere with daily life. Participants were asked to rate the extent to which VMS had interfered with each item during the previous 2-week time interval using a 0 (do not interfere) to 10 (completely interfere) scale. Overall mean score is the average of individual item scores (sum of items/10).</description>

        <title>Leeds Sleep Evaluation Questionnaire (LSEQ) Domain Scores at Weeks 4, 8, 12 and 15</title>
        <description>The LSEQ is a 10-item self-rated questionnaire that assesses a participants aspects of sleep and early morning behavior. The questions are grouped into 4 chronological areas: ease of getting to sleep, perceived quality of sleep, ease of awaking from sleep, and integrity of early morning behavior following wakefulness. The LSEQ is a visual analog scale that requires respondents to place marks on a group of 10 cm lines. Lines extend between extremes like &quot;more difficult than usual&quot; and &quot;easier than usual.&quot; Responses are measured using a 100 mm scale and are averaged to a score for each domain. Higher scores indicates better sleep and better early morning behavior.</description>

          <description>The LSEQ is a 10-item self-rated questionnaire that assesses a participants aspects of sleep and early morning behavior. The questions are grouped into 4 chronological areas: ease of getting to sleep, perceived quality of sleep, ease of awaking from sleep, and integrity of early morning behavior following wakefulness. The LSEQ is a visual analog scale that requires respondents to place marks on a group of 10 cm lines. Lines extend between extremes like &quot;more difficult than usual&quot; and &quot;easier than usual.&quot; Responses are measured using a 100 mm scale and are averaged to a score for each domain. Higher scores indicates better sleep and better early morning behavior.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Greene Climacteric Scale (GCS) at Weeks 4, 8, 12, and 15</title>
        <description>The GCS is a 21-item scale that provides a brief but comprehensive and valid measure of climacteric symptomatology. Each item is rated by the participant according to its severity using a 4-point rating scale from 0 (none) to 3 (severe). The first 20 items of the scale combine into 3 main independent symptom measures by summing up the individual item scores: psychological symptoms (items 1 to 11; score 0 to 33), physical symptoms (items 12 to 18; score 0 to 21), and VMS (items 19 to 20; score 0 to 6). Item 21 is a probe for sexual dysfunction. The total score can range from 0 to 63. Higher scores indicate worse symptoms.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Menopause-Specific Quality of Life (MENQoL) at Weeks 4, 8, 12, and 15</title>
        <description>The MENQoL is self-administered and consists of a total of 29 items in a Likert-scale format. Each item assesses the impact of 1 of 4 domains of menopausal symptoms, as experienced over the last month: vasomotor (items 1 to 3), psychosocial (items 4 to 10), physical (items 11 to 26), and sexual (items 27 to 29). Items pertaining to a specific symptom are rated as present or not present, and if present, how bothersome on a 0 (not bothersome) to 6 (extremely bothersome) scale. Means are computed for each subscale by dividing the sum of the domain's items by the number of items within that domain. Non-endorsement of an item is scored a &quot;1&quot; and endorsement a &quot;2,&quot; plus the number of the particular rating, so that the possible score on any item ranges from 1 to 8. Higher scores indicate that menopause symptoms are more bothersome.</description>
