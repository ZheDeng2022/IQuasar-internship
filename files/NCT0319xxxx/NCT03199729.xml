  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The long-term objective of this research is to develop an efficacious training paradigm to&#xD;
      enhance older adults' defense mechanisms against falls and possibility reduce healthcare&#xD;
      cost. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates the direct medical cost for&#xD;
      fall related injuries to be $30 billion annually. Slips and trips combined account for more&#xD;
      than 50% of the outdoor falls in community-dwelling older adults. These environmental&#xD;
      perturbations are opposing in nature, with slips mainly resulting in backward falls and trips&#xD;
      in forward falls. This project explores perturbation training through both slip and trip&#xD;
      exposure based on the principles of motor learning. The project design consists of a&#xD;
      randomized controlled trial to examine the ability of the central nervous system to mitigate&#xD;
      the interference in stability control (if any) that is induced by opposing types of&#xD;
      perturbations. It also introduces a novel combined slip and trip perturbation training&#xD;
      paradigm to enhance one's ability to retain and generalize the acquired fall-prevention&#xD;
      skills to both types of falls. Slips and trips induced on an over ground walkway will be used&#xD;
      to prepare the motor system to improve stability control and vertical limb support to resist&#xD;
      falls. The longer-term benefits of such combined perturbation training over exclusive&#xD;
      slip-only or trip-only perturbation training in reducing both laboratory-induced and real&#xD;
      life falls will also be assessed. The hypothesis of this study if supported by the results&#xD;
      will provide an evidence-supported training protocol to reduce the fall-risk among&#xD;
      community-dwelling older adults.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Impaired or delayed reactive postural responses pose a potential threat to falls while&#xD;
      walking resulting in slips or trips in older and neurologically impaired individuals.&#xD;
      Therefore, increase in understanding of postural responses to unexpected external&#xD;
      perturbation in older adults and people with neurological diseases will lead to development&#xD;
      of new therapeutic approaches for fall prevention in this population. The overall objective&#xD;
      of this is to investigate the dynamic stability during slip and trip-like experiences by&#xD;
      evaluating the efficiency of recovery responses, retention and fall-risk reduction to slips&#xD;
      or trips induced during normal walking in healthy older adults. Participants will be&#xD;
      community dwelling ambulatory older adults between the age range of 60 to 90 years. Subjects&#xD;
      will be screened for the inclusion criteria. Subjects who qualify will go through clinical&#xD;
      balance assessment and dynamic stability training. The older adults will be divided into any&#xD;
      of the four groups -1) overground slip only training, 2) overground trip only training, 3)&#xD;
      overground combined slip + trip training, or 4) control (single slip + single trip). For both&#xD;
      overground slip/trip, all subjects' normal walking pattern and their recovery responses to&#xD;
      slip/trip will be recorded with a motion tracking system (including videotaping) while they&#xD;
      walk across an instrumented area along a straight path in the lab. A slip will be induced&#xD;
      after a subject steps on a low-friction platform. A trip will be induced by introducing an&#xD;
      obstacle device while the subject is walking, which consists of a hinged aluminum plate. At&#xD;
      12 months post-training session, the follow-up stability test will consist only of one slip&#xD;
      and trip induced on the training side and contralateral side. Incidence of falls and physical&#xD;
      activity will be monitored between training and re-test sessions through falls and activity&#xD;
      monitoring-questionnaire to describe details of the falls.&#xD;

    <description>Perturbation is induced successfully and safely to reproduce inadvertent falls in a protective laboratory environment. Falls will be measured by the amount of body weight supported by the full-body harness system and measured by a load cell attached to this system. Instability of the body's COM and poor limb support prior to touchdown of the recovery step account for 90~100% of subsequent falls (occurring ~500ms later) in both sit-to-stand-slip and in gait-slip, in the laboratory settings. Intervention consists of repeated perturbation training to induce a change in the laboratory induced falls immediately post-training and examine it's retention 12 months after the initial training session.</description>
