    <textblock>
      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sometimes breast cancer spreads (metastasizes) to the brain. Researchers want to study new&#xD;
      treatments for brain metastases. The drug Temozolomide is approved to treat brain tumors.&#xD;
      Researchers want to see if combining it with the drug T-DMI prevents the formation of new&#xD;
      metastases in the brain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To study if Temozolomide with T-DM1 lowers the chance of having new metastases in the brain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adults at least 18 years old with a HER2-positive breast cancer that has spread to the brain&#xD;
      and was recently treated with stereotactic radiation or surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be screened with&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Medical history&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Physical exam&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Heart tests&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A scan (CT) that makes a picture of the body using a small amount of radiation&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A scan (MRI) that uses a magnetic field to make an image of the brain&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pregnancy test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be done in 3-week cycles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will get T-DM1 on Day 1 of every cycle through a small plastic tube inserted&#xD;
      in an arm vein.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Some participants will also take Temozolomide capsules by mouth every day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will keep a medication diary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the study, participants will also:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Repeat most of the screening tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Answer questions about their general well-being and functioning.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have lumbar puncture at least 2 times. A needle is inserted into the spinal&#xD;
      canal low in the back and cerebrospinal fluid is collected. This will be done with local&#xD;
      anesthesia and with the help of images.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be asked to provide tumor samples when available.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have a follow-up visit about 1 month after stopping the study drug. They&#xD;
      will be contacted by telephone or email every 3 months after that.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Breast cancer is the most common cancer in women. In the HER2+ subtype, brain metastases&#xD;
           can occur in up to 25-40% of patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The standard therapy for brain metastases continues to be surgery or stereotactic&#xD;
           radiosurgery (SRS) and/or whole brain radiation therapy (WBRT).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Currently, independently of localized or systemic treatment modality, once brain&#xD;
           metastases are established, options for treatment are limited, and the disease almost&#xD;
           invariably progresses, limiting not only survival but also quality of life in most&#xD;
           patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Preclinical literature suggests the hypothesis that preventing the formation of a&#xD;
           metastasis by a drug may be more efficacious than attempting to shrink an established&#xD;
           lesion.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Our group has shown in vitro and in vivo in animal models injected with a brain tropic&#xD;
           MGMT+ cell line, that even in very low doses temozolomide (TMZ) administered in a&#xD;
           prophylactic, metronomic fashion can significantly prevent development of brain&#xD;
           metastases.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  We propose a secondary-prevention clinical trial with oral TMZ given to HER2+ breast&#xD;
           cancer patients with brain metastases after recent local treatment (SRS or surgical&#xD;
           resection) in combination with the anti-HER2 agent T-DM1 for systemic control of&#xD;
           disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Phase I (run in): to identify the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of TMZ when used in&#xD;
           combination with T-DM1.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Phase II: to determine if the combination regimen of T-DM1 and temozolomide improves the&#xD;
           freedom from distant new brain metastases following stereotactic radiosurgery or&#xD;
           surgical resection in HER2-positive breast cancer brain metastases, as compared to T-DM1&#xD;
           alone guided by one-year results as an important benchmark for measuring improvement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase I:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Histologically confirmed HER2+ breast cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  ECOG performance status 0-2 and adequate organ and marrow function.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Brain metastases, treated within 12 weeks of study entry with SRS, resection or WBRT.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients with leptomeningeal metastatic disease are ineligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients that are unable to complete a brain MRI with contrast are ineligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients with breast tissue expanders must have those removed before enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  HBV, HCV or HIV-positive patients are ineligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patient with impaired cardiac function or clinically significant cardiac disease are&#xD;
           ineligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Corticosteroids will be allowed at enrollment and during the first month of treatment&#xD;
           with T-DM1 after SRS, up to a dose of no more than 10mg of dexamethasone daily or&#xD;
           equivalent. Patients that need to continue corticosteroids after the initial month will&#xD;
           not be allowed to increase the dose after that period, and will be taken off protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase II:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Histologically confirmed HER2+ breast cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  ECOG performance status 0-2 and adequate organ and marrow function.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  1-10 brain metastases, by contrast MRI, treated within 12 weeks of study entry with SRS&#xD;
           and/or resection.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients with leptomeningeal metastatic disease are ineligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients with history of WBRT are ineligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients that are unable to complete a brain MRI with contrast are ineligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients with breast tissue expanders must have those removed before enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  HBV, HCV or HIV-positive patients are ineligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patient with impaired cardiac function or clinically significant cardiac disease are&#xD;
           ineligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Corticosteroids will be allowed at enrollment and during the first month of treatment&#xD;
           with T-DM1 after SRS, up to a dose of no more than 10mg of dexamethasone daily or&#xD;
           equivalent. Patients that need to continue corticosteroids after the initial month will&#xD;
           not be allowed to increase the dose after that period, and will be taken off protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  This is a Phase I/II open label study that will evaluate the potential benefit of TMZ in&#xD;
           prevention of new brain metastases in patients with limited brain metastases from HER2+&#xD;
           breast cancer, previously treated with SRS or surgical resection of brain metastases.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  All patients will receive the standard second-line therapy for HER2+ metastatic breast&#xD;
           cancer: T-DM1. During phase II patients will be randomized between T-DM1 plus TMZ versus&#xD;
           T-DM1 alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Phase I run in: T-DM1 3.6 mg/kg IV every 21 days plus TMZ 30, 40 or 50 mg/m^2 daily.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Phase II: T-DM1 3.6 mg/kg versus T-DM1 3.6mg/kg plus TMZ at recommended phase 2 dose&#xD;
           (RP2D).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Phase I will follow a standard 3+3 design. Thus, with 3 dose levels, up to 18 patients&#xD;
           may be included in the initial safety evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In the phase II portion of the trial, a total of 49 evaluable subjects per arm (98&#xD;
           total) will need to be randomized over a 3-year period and followed for an additional 2&#xD;
           years from the date of entry of the last patient, with occurrence of 79 total relapses&#xD;
           in both arms combined, in order to have 80% power to compare the curves.&#xD;

             potential reactivation of hepatitis virus with temozolomide use.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Grade greater than or equal to 3 peripheral neuropathy according to (NCI CTCAE)&#xD;
             version 4.0.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Cerebral Vascular Accident (CVA) or Transitory Ischemic Attack (TIA) in the year&#xD;
             before enrollment, or presence of residual symptoms from CVA that happened more than a&#xD;
             year before.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pulmonary Embolism (PE) in the 3 months before enrollment. Anticoagulation is&#xD;
             permitted.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Impaired cardiac function or clinically significant cardiac disease including the&#xD;
             following:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  New York Heart Association grade III or IV congestive heart failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Myocardial infarction within the last 12 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects with impaired LVEF (&lt;50%).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with inability to complete brain MRI studies with contrast.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with breast tissue expanders must have those removed before enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic&#xD;
             composition to temozolomide or T-DM1. Patients who are tolerating TDM1 successfully&#xD;
             with premedications and slower infusion will be allowed.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients receiving medications that are strong CYP3A4 inhibitors or inducers are&#xD;
             ineligible. In vitro studies indicate that DM1, the cytotoxic component of T-DM1, is&#xD;
             metabolized mainly by CYP3A4 and to a lesser extent by CYP3A5. Concomitant use of&#xD;
             strong CYP3A4 inhibitors with T-DM1 should be avoided due to the potential for an&#xD;
             increase in DM1 exposure and toxicity. Consider an alternate medication with no or&#xD;
             minimal potential to inhibit CYP3A4. Lists including medications and substances known&#xD;
             or with the potential to interact with CYP3A4 isoenzymes.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active&#xD;
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac&#xD;
             arrhythmia, that would limit compliance with study requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because temozolomide is an alkylating&#xD;
             agent with the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Because there is an&#xD;
             unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to&#xD;
             treatment of the mother with temozolomide and/or T-DM1, breastfeeding should be&#xD;
             discontinued if the mother is treated with either of those agents. These potential&#xD;
             risks may also apply to other agents used in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  HIV-positive patients are excluded because these patients are at increased risk of&#xD;
             lethal infections when treated with marrow-suppressive therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with any other concomitant invasive malignancies are ineligible. Prior&#xD;
             invasive cancers treated with curative intent, and with no evidence of recurrent&#xD;
             disease, may be eligible after PI evaluation. Patients with treated limited stage&#xD;
             basal cell or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin or carcinoma in situ of the breast&#xD;
             or cervix are eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Phase 2 Exclusion Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who are receiving any other investigational agents.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients unable to speak or understand English, since they cannot complete&#xD;
             neurocognitive evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with known leptomeningeal metastatic disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients previously treated with whole brain radiation therapy (WBRT).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with major symptoms or impairments related to brain metastases, such as&#xD;
             aphasia or severe confusion, will be excluded per PI discretion when those symptoms&#xD;
             preclude proper neurocognitive evaluation during the study treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have received previous treatment with T-DM1 and had systemic progression&#xD;
             of disease while on it, are ineligible. Patients receiving treatment with T- DM1 whose&#xD;
             only site of disease progression was brain are allowed to enroll in this trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have received chemotherapy in the previous 3 weeks (6 weeks for&#xD;
             nitrosoureas or mitomycin).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  HBV (HBs Ag positive) or HCV (anti-HCV positive) patients are ineligible because of&#xD;
             potential reactivation of hepatitis virus with temozolomide use.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Grade greater than or equal to 3 peripheral neuropathy according to (NCI CTCAE)&#xD;
             version 4.0.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Cerebral Vascular Accident (CVA) or Transitory Ischemic Attack (TIA) in the year&#xD;
             before enrollment, or presence of residual symptoms from CVA that happened more than a&#xD;
             year before.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pulmonary Embolism (PE) in the 3 months before enrollment. Anticoagulation is&#xD;
             permitted.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Impaired cardiac function or clinically significant cardiac disease including the&#xD;
             following:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  New York Heart Association grade III or IV congestive heart failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Myocardial infarction within the last 12 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Subjects with impaired LVEF (&lt;50%).&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
               -  Patients with breast tissue expanders must have those removed before enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or&#xD;
                  biologic composition to temozolomide or T-DM1. Patients who are tolerating TDM1&#xD;
                  successfully with premedications and slower infusion will be allowed.&#xD;
