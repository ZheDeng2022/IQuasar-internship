  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      At least 60% of Veterans with an alcohol use disorder will relapse within 6 months of&#xD;
      treatment, irrespective of the type of treatment they receive. This indicates that currently&#xD;
      available interventions for treating AUD in Veterans are not effective in helping them&#xD;
      achieve long-term sobriety. Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is a brain&#xD;
      stimulation method that is at the forefront of innovative, non-invasive, and safe treatments&#xD;
      for AUD. However, there have been no studies that specifically determined the effectiveness&#xD;
      of rTMS treatment for Veterans with AUD. This project will evaluate the effectiveness of rTMS&#xD;
      treatment in promoting long-term abstinence in Veterans suffering from AUD. Assisting&#xD;
      Veterans in achieving long-term and sustained sobriety is critical because it is associated&#xD;
      with the best medical, cognitive, psychiatric, and psychosocial recovery from AUD.&#xD;

      Due to COVID-19 restrictions, active recruiting was suspended 31MAR20.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of intermittent theta burst repetitive&#xD;
      transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) as a treatment for Veterans with an alcohol use&#xD;
      disorder (AUD) to decrease the exceedingly high rate of relapse associated with this&#xD;
      condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At least 60% of those with AUD will experience a major relapse period within 6 months of&#xD;
      treatment, irrespective of the intervention (psychosocial and/or pharmacological) employed.&#xD;
      Consequently, the high prevalence of AUD and relapse following treatment in Veterans is&#xD;
      associated with substantial resource allocation and costs for the DVA Health Care System.&#xD;
      Current pharmacological and psychosocial interventions demonstrate only a moderate level of&#xD;
      efficacy, which is reflected in the high rate of relapse in AUD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      rTMS is a neurostimulation method that is at the forefront of innovative, non-invasive, and&#xD;
      safe treatments for AUD, and the disorders that commonly co-occur with AUD. To reduce the&#xD;
      high rate of relapse in Veterans with AUD, it is necessary for interventions to more&#xD;
      effectively address the associated neurobiological dysfunction and salient co-occurring&#xD;
      conditions. Accordingly, additional rigorously controlled studies are required to determine&#xD;
      if intermittent theta burst rTMS is an effective treatment for Veterans with AUD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be recruited from VA Palo Alto Health Care System (VAPAHCS) residential&#xD;
      substance abuse treatment clinics A double-blind randomized clinical trial with two groups:&#xD;
      Active rTMS Treatment Group (Active rTMS) - will receive five treatments (two treatments per&#xD;
      day) per week for 2 weeks. Sham Control Treatment group (i.e., identical rTMS experimental&#xD;
      procedure, but no active stimulation) will receive the same frequency and duration of rTMS&#xD;
      sessions. The proposed rTMS protocol is consistent with the FDA approved treatment regimen&#xD;
      employed for major depressive disorders at the VAPAHCS MIRECC. Magnetic resonance imaging&#xD;
      (MR) will be completed pre and post rTMS treatment and used to localize the left DLPFC in&#xD;
      each participant to optimize rTMS for this region. Active and Sham rTMS groups will complete&#xD;
      predictive measures [i.e., MR measures of anterior frontal glutamate level, blood flow, and&#xD;
      tissue volume, diffusion tensor imaging, functional connectivity, task-based fMRI] and other&#xD;
      outcome measures (i.e., measures of craving, mood, anxiety, neurocognition) immediately pre-&#xD;
      and post-completion of the 2 weeks of rTMS sessions. Genetic markers (i.e., brain derived&#xD;
      neurotrophic factor plasma levels and polymorphisms) will also be collected. Neuroimaging and&#xD;
      genetic measures are necessary to establish potential biomarkers for prediction of rTMS&#xD;
      treatment response, which is requisite for therapeutic optimization. For the 6 months&#xD;
      following completion of active or sham rTMS treatment, participants will be contacted&#xD;
      monthly, via telephone or in person, to complete a brief standardized measure of alcohol and&#xD;
      substance use, craving, and psychiatric symptomatology to assess for changes in these&#xD;
      variables over the previous 30 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This project will deliver completely novel data on the efficacy of intermittent theta burst&#xD;
      rTMS for Veterans with AUD during the first 6 months following treatment. Monitoring over the&#xD;
      entire first 6 months following treatment is crucial, given relapse within the first 6 months&#xD;
      of treatment is robustly related to poor psychosocial functioning over the ensuing 1-3 years.&#xD;
      The ultimate goal of this proposal is provide treatment that more effectively promotes&#xD;
      sustained abstinence in the Veteran with AUD, as extended abstinence is robustly associated&#xD;
      with optimum biomedical, neuropsychological, psychiatric, and psychosocial recovery and&#xD;
      functioning.&#xD;
