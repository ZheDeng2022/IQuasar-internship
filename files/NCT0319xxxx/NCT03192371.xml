  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the 1 year immunogenicity persistence of Rabipur in&#xD;
      children 6-17 years of age, and compare the Zagreb regimen with the Essen regimen.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The clinical basis for the last renewal of the Rabipur license in China was the results from&#xD;
      study V49_24 (NCT01680016), an immunogenicity and safety trial conducted in Chinese children&#xD;
      (6 to 17 years) and adults (≥51 years), which confirmed the non-inferior immunogenicity of&#xD;
      the Zagreb versus the conventional Essen post exposure prophylaxis intramuscular (PEP IM)&#xD;
      regimen at Day 15 for both age groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the time of license renewal in 2015, the Chinese health authorities requested that GSK&#xD;
      continue to conduct immunogenicity persistence follow-ups for at least 1 year to compare the&#xD;
      Zagreb regimen with the Essen regimen in populations under 17 years old.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V49_24E1 is an extension study to meet this request, in which subjects aged 17 years or&#xD;
      younger who were immunized in the parent trial V49_24 will be recalled for a blood&#xD;
      immunogenicity analysis approximately 4-5 years after the original vaccination.&#xD;

  <overall_status>Withdrawn</overall_status>
  <why_stopped>
    Due to supply constraints &amp; prioritization according to medical need (availability of&#xD;
    alternative rabies vaccines), Rabipur will no longer be supplied to China.&#xD;

    <time_frame>From Day1/Visit 1 through Day 393/Visit 11 (study termination).</time_frame>
    <description>Only SAEs and unsolicited AEs leading to study withdrawal will be collected. SAEs to be assessed include medical occurrences that result in death, are life threatening, require hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, result in disability/incapacity, result in congenital anomaly/or birth defect or significant medical event that may not be immediately life threatening or resulting in death or hospitalization but may jeopardize the subject or require intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed.&#xD;
An unsolicited AE is an AE that was not solicited using a Subject Diary and that was spontaneously communicated by a subject and/or parent(s)/legal guardian(s) who has signed the informed consent. Potential unsolicited AEs may be medically attended (defined as symptoms or illnesses requiring hospitalization, or emergency room visit, or visit to/by a health care provider), or were of concern to the subject and/or parent(s)/legal guardian(s).</description>
