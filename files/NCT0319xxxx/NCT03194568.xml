      This study will assess whether Anterior Vertebral Tethering is a safe and feasible method of&#xD;
      anterior approach surgery for spinal deformity in pediatric idiopathic scoliosis.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Scoliosis is a condition in which the spine is deformed by a curvature in the coronal plane.&#xD;
      It is generally associated with a twisting (axial plane) deformity as well. It can have a&#xD;
      variety of underlying etiologies and the etiology is used to classify the types of scoliosis.&#xD;
      Idiopathic scoliosis is sub-classified in two ways: by age of onset and by magnitude of&#xD;
      deformity. Curves between 10 and 25 degrees are considered mild. Curves between 25 and 50&#xD;
      degrees are classified as moderate. Curves greater than 50 degrees are termed severe. The&#xD;
      current standard of care for moderate scoliosis in patients with remaining growth is to&#xD;
      utilize a thoracolumbosacral orthosis (TLSO brace) to prevent progression of deformity. The&#xD;
      scientific evidence has supported the efficacy of this intervention in avoiding progression&#xD;
      of the Cobb angle to 50 degrees or more.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If treated with a TLSO brace, many idiopathic scoliosis patients would conceivably be&#xD;
      subjected to years of brace wear and the cost and psychological factors inherent therein.&#xD;
      Additional downsides of brace treatment include the potentially negative psychosocial impact&#xD;
      of wearing an external sign of deformity during adolescence, a key period of emotional&#xD;
      development. Prior research has identified negative psychosocial effects related to wearing a&#xD;
      brace in children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recent evidence has suggested that certain curve patterns will likely progress to 50 degrees&#xD;
      or more, despite treatment with a TLSO brace. Sanders, et al. demonstrated a correlation of&#xD;
      Cobb angle (greater than 35 degrees) and skeletal maturity (bone age 4 or less) to the risk&#xD;
      of progression to 50 degrees or more, despite TLSO bracing. The evidence supports that the&#xD;
      current practice of TLSO bracing is not an effective treatment to avoid progression to 50&#xD;
      degrees in these patients. It is on this population (thoracic Cobb angle greater than 35&#xD;
      degrees, bone age of 4 or less) that we intend to test the safety and feasibility of Anterior&#xD;
      Vertebral Body Tethering to avoid curve progression to 50 degrees.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study intervention is surgical orthopedic implantation of the Anterior Vertebral Tether&#xD;
      Device, by way of thoracoscopic surgery under general anesthesia. The primary outcome&#xD;
      measures include assessments of safety of the insertion procedure and of the device, as well&#xD;
      as the secondary measure of feasibility by determining the ability to successfully implant&#xD;
      the investigational device.&#xD;
