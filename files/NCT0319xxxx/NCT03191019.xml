  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether a mobile-phone based intervention is&#xD;
      effective in supporting smoking cessation among Chilean women&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This protocol corresponds to a single-blind, two-arm, randomized clinical trial of a smoking&#xD;
      cessation intervention based on a mobile-phone app. Eligible participants are Chilean women&#xD;
      from the Metropolitan Region, who smoke daily (at least one cigarette per day) or weekly (at&#xD;
      least 7 cigarettes per week), and who are willing to make a quit attempt within one month of&#xD;
      enrollment. Study will be advertised on the local radio, primary care centers, smoking&#xD;
      cessation services and through social media campaigns. Study information will be available&#xD;
      online. Potential participants will be asked to register their interest by sending an email&#xD;
      to the study. Research assistants then will contact respondents by phone in order to complete&#xD;
      a baseline questionnaire about sociodemographic variables, characteristics of tobacco&#xD;
      consumption, and to assess eligibility for the study. Eligible participants will be then&#xD;
      randomized to the intervention group or control group using a computerized and automated&#xD;
      process, in blocks of 6. A minimization algorithm balancing for Fagerstrom score for nicotine&#xD;
      addiction (≤5, &gt;5) will be used. Researchers who will gather data and those who will measure&#xD;
      carbon monoxide in exhaled air will be masked to treatment allocation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each participant will be emailed the link with either the intervention or the control version&#xD;
      of the mobile-phone app. Once participants download the app, they will be asked to provide&#xD;
      informed consent by clicking the &quot;accept&quot; or &quot;reject&quot; button in the app.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants randomized to the intervention app will be sent motivational and preparatory&#xD;
      content for the first two weeks, and they will be asked to set a quit date within 4 weeks&#xD;
      from enrollment. The mobile app will send an average of 4 messages per day during the first&#xD;
      month after quit date, followed by three messages per week up to the end of the study at&#xD;
      month 6.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intervention program was designed based on current best evidence on strategies to support&#xD;
      smoking cessation, and included work of Chilean experts in smoking cessation. The design of&#xD;
      the intervention app also included the opinion and preferences of potential participants who&#xD;
      participated in focus groups during intervention design. The intervention app includes&#xD;
      motivational messages, tips on stress management, on how to ask support from friends and&#xD;
      family, how to use distraction techniques and how to deal with cravings, lapses and early&#xD;
      relapse.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intervention app also includes a &quot;help button&quot; which provides extra messages in case of&#xD;
      cravings and a &quot;lapse/relapse button&quot;, which provides advice about what to do if the&#xD;
      participant returned to smoke. The control group will receive a control app which will send 1&#xD;
      message every two weeks thanking participants for taking part in the study, and encouraging&#xD;
      them to stay in the study for the 6 month follow-up period. After completing the 6-month&#xD;
      follow-up evaluation, the control group will be offered access to the intervention app.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Women will not receive financial compensation for their participation in the study. In order&#xD;
      to increase retention, participants in both arms will be told that they would be entered into&#xD;
      a lottery for different prizes after answering the 6-month follow-up questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the 4-week, 3-month and 6-month follow-up, a link to an electronic follow-up&#xD;
      questionnaire will be emailed to all participants. Reminders will be sent to non responders&#xD;
      and if they still do not respond, additional email reminders will be sent. If participants&#xD;
      still do not respond, research assistants will call them by phone in order to capture the&#xD;
      primary outcome of the study. At 6-month follow-up, participants who reported having quit&#xD;
      smoking will be asked to attend to the local primary care center in order to measure carbon&#xD;
      monoxide in exhaled air. All measurements will be performed by research assistants who are&#xD;
      masked to treatment allocation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size was calculated based on previous studies. Twenty-eight percent quitting in the&#xD;
      intervention group and 13% in the control group was expected. To achieve 90% power with a&#xD;
      significance level of P ≤ .05 (2-sided), and including a 20% attrition for the 6 month&#xD;
      follow-up evaluation, a sample size of 400 was estimated. In order to take into account that&#xD;
      the size effect associated to the intervention could be lesser in Chile than the reported for&#xD;
      other countries, investigators defined a 90% power for the sample size calculation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators plan to conduct analyses for the whole sample and also for subgroups of age&#xD;
      (&lt;35 years, ≥35 years), nicotine addiction (Fagerstrom score ≤5, &gt;5), educational level (&lt;8&#xD;
      years, 8-12 years, ≥12 years), and use of other smoking cessation treatments or services&#xD;
      during the trial (yes, no).&#xD;
&#xD;
      All statistical analyses for clinical effectiveness will be undertaken on an&#xD;
      intention-to-treat basis. For missing observations in the primary outcome, two methods will&#xD;
      be used: last value carried forward method and multiple imputation method, as attempts to&#xD;
      correct for potential bias caused by missing data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analyses for adverse effects outcomes will be performed on a per-protocol basis.&#xD;
