  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of the drugs&#xD;
      dapagliflozin and saxagliptin in patients with Type 2 Diabetes who are aged 10 to below 18&#xD;
      years old and are currently taking metformin, insulin, or both drugs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dapagliflozin and saxagliptin are both approved for use in patients with Type 2 Diabetes aged&#xD;
      18 years or older. Dapagliflozin (alone or in combination with other antidiabetic drugs) is&#xD;
      available for use in adults in approximately 40 countries worldwide including the USA and&#xD;
      Europe. Saxagliptin (alone or in combination with other antidiabetic drugs) is available for&#xD;
      use in adults in approximately 90 countries worldwide. This study will assess how well&#xD;
      dapagliflozin and saxagliptin work by finding out how these treatments affect blood glucose&#xD;
      (sugar) levels compared to placebo (a pill that contains no active drug), in children and&#xD;
      adolescents. Dapagliflozin and saxagliptin are considered investigational products in this&#xD;
      study since while they have been approved for use in adults (patients 18 years or older),&#xD;
      they haven't been approved for children and adolescents due to lack of clinical studies in&#xD;
      this specific population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with Type 2 Diabetes have higher levels of blood glucose (sugar) than patients who&#xD;
      do not have this disease. The high level of sugar in the blood can lead to serious short-term&#xD;
      and long-term medical problems. The main goal of treating diabetic patients is to lower blood&#xD;
      glucose to a normal level. Lowering and controlling blood glucose help prevent or delay&#xD;
      complications of diabetes, such as heart disease, kidney, eye and nerve diseases, and the&#xD;
      possibility of amputation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dapagliflozin is a drug that helps to reduce blood glucose (sugar) levels by helping the&#xD;
      kidneys to remove excess glucose from the blood and excrete it in the urine. It prevents the&#xD;
      kidneys from returning glucose from the urine back into the bloodstream.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Saxagliptin increases insulin production when blood glucose levels are high. Insulin is a&#xD;
      hormone made by the pancreas that allows the body to use sugar (glucose) from the food that&#xD;
      is eaten for energy or to store glucose for future use. Saxagliptin helps to improve blood&#xD;
      sugar levels in response to a meal and between meals if blood glucose levels are not lowered&#xD;
      effectively. Saxagliptin does not work when the blood glucose is low. Saxagliptin also helps&#xD;
      to decrease the amount of sugar made by the body. Together, these processes reduce blood&#xD;
      glucose levels and help to control Type 2 Diabetes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The subject will either receive one of the active study drugs or a placebo (a pill that looks&#xD;
      identical but contains inactive drug). This study will be double blind; this means that&#xD;
      neither the subject, nor the study doctor will know which treatment the subject will receive.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Which treatment the subject receives is decided by a computer, purely by chance; this is&#xD;
      called a &quot;random assignment&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For this study, there will first be a screening phase of up to 6 months if Investigator&#xD;
      thinks that some of the screening tests can be repeated, followed by a 2 week lead in phase.&#xD;
      Thereafter there will be a 26W short-term treatment phase (W1-26), and a 26 W long-term&#xD;
      treatment phase (W27-52). Following this there will be a follow-up telephone call on week 56&#xD;
      and a post study visit at W104. At day 1 visit after the lead in phase the subject will be&#xD;
      randomly assigned to receive one of 3 treatments: dapagliflozin 5 mg, saxagliptin 2.5 mg or&#xD;
      placebo in a blinded manner. This treatment will continue up to week 14. Then after week 14,&#xD;
      and until the end of the study, the subject will be assigned to receive one of the following&#xD;
      5 treatments: dapagliflozin 5 mg, dapagliflozin 10 mg, saxagliptin 2.5 mg, saxagliptin 5 mg&#xD;
      or placebo in a blinded manner. The drugs assigned after week 14 will be the same drugs as at&#xD;
      Day 1, but some of the groups will receive them at a higher dose.Starting at W32 or W40,&#xD;
      i.e., after the end of the primary endpoints, patients with background medication of&#xD;
      metformin only, and an HbA1c value &lt; 7.5% at W26 or W32, will undergo a third randomization.&#xD;
      Eligible subjects from the treatment arms will undergo the randomized withdrawal of&#xD;
      background medication, while eligible patients from the placebo arm will undergo, in addition&#xD;
      to randomized withdrawal of background medication a randomized switch to active treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Short- and long-term period study visits can be delayed by a maximum of 11 months in total.&#xD;
      If the duration of investigational product administration is longer than 52 (+1) weeks, the&#xD;
      safety follow-up period should be shortened such that the complete study duration does not&#xD;
      exceed 104 weeks. The W104 visit should not be delayed.If more than 12 weeks elapse between&#xD;
      the HbA1c collection at W26 and the third rand at W32, or the HbA1c collection at W32 and the&#xD;
      third rand at W40, the subject should not go through this rand as the HbA1c value would no&#xD;
      longer be reliable to ascertain eligibility for the third rand&#xD;

      In pediatric Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) subjects on diet and exercise and metformin, or&#xD;
      insulin, or metformin and insulin:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary research hypothesis for dapagliflozin is whether addition of dapagliflozin,&#xD;
      including up-titration if needed, results in a greater mean reduction from baseline in&#xD;
      glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) as compared to placebo when each are administered over 26&#xD;
      weeks of oral double-blind add-on treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary research hypothesis for saxagliptin is whether addition of saxagliptin, including&#xD;
      up-titration if needed, results in a greater mean reduction from baseline in HbA1c as&#xD;
      compared to placebo when each are administered over 26 weeks of oral double-blind add-on&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design: The proposed study is a 26-week Phase 3b, multicenter, randomized,&#xD;
      placebo-controlled, double-blind, parallel group study with a 26-week safety extension period&#xD;
      to evaluate the safety and efficacy of dapagliflozin (5 mg and 10 mg), and, separately,&#xD;
      saxagliptin (2.5 mg and 5 mg) in pediatric subjects with T2DM, and an additional post study&#xD;
      visit at Week 104 for assessment of measures of growth and maturity. Approximately 243&#xD;
      pediatric subjects will be randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive dapagliflozin 5 mg,&#xD;
      saxagliptin 2.5 mg, or placebo. Approximately 81 subjects will be randomized to each&#xD;
      treatment arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After a 26-week, double-blind, ST treatment period, the primary efficacy endpoint will be&#xD;
      assessed. This will be followed by a 26-week, site- and subject-blind LT safety extension&#xD;
      period. Dapagliflozin and, separately, saxagliptin will be compared against the single shared&#xD;
      placebo comparator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measures of growth and maturity will be assessed at the Week 104 post study visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be required to have been treated with diet and exercise and a stable dose of at&#xD;
      least 1000 mg metformin (IR or XR) for a minimum of 8 weeks, or a stable baseline dose of&#xD;
      insulin for a minimum of 8 weeks, or a stable combination of at least 1000 mg metformin and&#xD;
      insulin for a minimum of 8 weeks prior to randomization. At least 50% of subjects will be on&#xD;
      a stable baseline dose of metformin, with or without concurrent insulin therapy. At least 30%&#xD;
      of total subjects will be between the ages of 10 and 14 years and at least one third, but no&#xD;
      more than two thirds, female subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the 2-week lead-in period, subjects will be instructed on a diet and exercise program&#xD;
      (in accordance with the American Diabetes Association [ADA] or similar local guidelines) to&#xD;
      be followed for the study duration. Subjects will maintain their baseline types and/or doses&#xD;
      of antidiabetic therapy throughout the study (2-week lead-in, 26-week double-blind ST&#xD;
      treatment period, and the 26-week blinded safety extension LT treatment period). If&#xD;
      applicable, investigators will encourage subjects to keep their insulin doses stable.&#xD;
      Down-titration of insulin will be allowed only as necessary to prevent hypoglycemia and will&#xD;
      be at the discretion of the Investigator. Home glucose meters to monitor glucose control will&#xD;
      be dispensed to subjects and self-blood glucose monitoring (SBGM) requirements and procedures&#xD;
      will be explained. Subjects will also be instructed on the use of the subject diary to record&#xD;
      self-monitored glucose levels and daily insulin dose, if applicable. Subjects will also&#xD;
      receive a blood ketone meter for testing when DKA is suspected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the lead-in period, eligible subjects with HbA1c of 6.5% to 10.5% at screening will be&#xD;
      randomized 1:1:1 to receive oral, double-blind, dapagliflozin 5 mg (approximately 81&#xD;
      subjects), saxagliptin 2.5 mg (approximately 81 subjects), or placebo (approximately 81&#xD;
      subjects). Randomization will be stratified based on baseline anti-diabetes treatment regimen&#xD;
      (stable baseline dose of metformin (IR or XR), a stable baseline dose of insulin, or a stable&#xD;
      combination of metformin and insulin), gender, and age (10 to below 15 years of age, 15 to&#xD;
      below 18 years of age).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A blinded HbA1c assessment will be performed at Week 12. All subjects with Week 12 HbA1c&#xD;
      values &lt; 7% will remain on previously assigned randomized treatment (dapagliflozin 5 mg, or&#xD;
      saxagliptin 2.5 mg, or placebo) after the Week 12 assessment. Subjects assigned to the&#xD;
      dapagliflozin treatment arm at Day 1 Randomization with Week 12 HbA1c values &gt;= 7% will be&#xD;
      re-randomized in a 1:1 ratio to continue on the low-dose treatment (dapagliflozin 5 mg) or&#xD;
      up-titrate to the high-dose treatment (dapagliflozin 10 mg) after the Week 12 assessment.&#xD;
      Similarly, subjects assigned to the saxagliptin treatment arm at Day 1 Randomization with&#xD;
      Week 12 HbA1c values &gt;= 7% will be re randomized in a 1:1 ratio to continue on the low-dose&#xD;
      treatment (saxagliptin 2.5 mg) or up-titrate to the high-dose treatment (saxagliptin 5 mg)&#xD;
      after the Week 12 assessment. Subjects assigned to the placebo treatment arm at Day 1&#xD;
      Randomization with Week 12 HbA1c values &gt;= 7% will continue on placebo treatment. To maintain&#xD;
      the blinding of treatments as well as HbA1c results, all placebo subjects and all subjects&#xD;
      taking saxagliptin or dapagliflozin with an HbA1c &lt; 7% at week 12 will go through a dummy 2nd&#xD;
      randomization process that will be indistinguishable (for the subjects and site personnel)&#xD;
      from the actual 2nd randomization. During the Week 14 visit, blinded study drug will be&#xD;
      dispensed to all subjects in accordance with new treatment assignments based on Week 12 HbA1c&#xD;
      assessments. After completion of assessments at Week 26, a subset of eligible subjects who&#xD;
      are receiving background medication with metformin only will undergo a third randomization&#xD;
      (randomized withdrawal of background medication) at either Week 32 or Week 40. Eligibility&#xD;
      for randomized withdrawal from background medication will be restricted to subjects who are&#xD;
      receiving background treatment with metformin only, and who have HbA1c &lt; 7.5% at Week 26 or&#xD;
      Week 32 provided they have not initiated rescue glycemic control therapy or been withdrawn&#xD;
      from study drug. Subjects who are receiving background medication with metformin only, who do&#xD;
      not qualify for the third randomization at Week 32 due to an HbA1c ≥ 7.5% at Week 26, may&#xD;
      qualify for the third randomization at Week 40 if HbA1c &lt; 7.5% at Week 32. Subjects who have&#xD;
      passed Week 40 will not be included in the randomized withdrawal of background medication&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of the ST treatment period, all subjects will enter the LT treatment period.&#xD;
      All subjects, including those randomized to receive placebo, will continue with their&#xD;
      randomized study medication assigned after the Week 12 assessment in the site- and subject&#xD;
      blind LT treatment period. Adverse events (AEs) and serious adverse events (SAEs) will be&#xD;
      assessed during a Week 56 phone visit.In case a visit is delayed for any reason, subsequent&#xD;
      visits should be scheduled such that an interval of at least 12 weeks is maintained between&#xD;
      the:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Week 14 visit and the Week 26 visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Third randomization (for subjects undergoing third randomization; occurring at the Week&#xD;
           32 or the Week 40 visit) and the Week 52 visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If more than 12 weeks elapse between the HbA1c collection at Week 26 and the third&#xD;
      randomization at Week 32, or the HbA1c collection at Week 32 and the third randomization at&#xD;
      Week 40, the subject should not go through this randomization as the HbA1c value would no&#xD;
      longer be reliable to ascertain eligibility for the third randomization. Short- and long term&#xD;
      period study visits can be delayed by a maximum of 11 months in total. If the duration of IP&#xD;
      administration is longer than 52 (+1) weeks, the safety follow-up period should be shortened&#xD;
      such that the complete study duration does not exceed 104 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects who discontinue study drug before the end of the study treatment period will enter a&#xD;
      non-treatment, follow up phase, in which subjects will follow their visit schedules with&#xD;
      modified assessments until study completion. Subjects will attend a post-study visit at Week&#xD;
      104, for assessment of measures of growth and maturity.This visit should be completed without&#xD;
      delay (at 104 weeks from Day 1 + 7 days), regardless of whether any other study visits were&#xD;
      delayed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If scheduled visits at clinical sites will be significantly impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic&#xD;
      (e.g., there is a risk that the subject may be exposed to COVID-19 when visiting the site),&#xD;
      home visits by study site personnel/vendor are allowed in countries where this is&#xD;
      logistically feasible and considered acceptable. Before such a visit, a risk assessment that&#xD;
      considers the potential risks to both the subject and the study personnel has to be&#xD;
      performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Discontinued subjects will not be replaced. Samples for analysis of plasma levels of&#xD;
      dapagliflozin, saxagliptin and its metabolite 5-Hydroxy saxagliptin (5 OH saxagliptin) will&#xD;
      be collected pre-dose and approximately 2 hours post-dose (+/- 1 hour) during the Week 6, 12,&#xD;
      20, and 26 visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Samples for analysis of plasma glucose will be collected pre-dose during the Day 1 visit, and&#xD;
      pre-dose and approximately 2 hours post-dose (+/- 1 hour) during the Week 6, 12, 20, and 26&#xD;
      visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Plasma samples for analysis of dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) activity will be collected&#xD;
      pre-dose during the Day 1 visit, and at 2 (+/-1) hours post-dose during the Week 6, 12, 20,&#xD;
      and 26 visits.Samples may be collected at additional time points during the study if&#xD;
      warranted and agreed upon between the investigator and the Sponsor, eg, for safety reasons.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All plasma samples will be drawn in the fasting condition. During the course of the trial,&#xD;
      subjects may be eligible for the addition of open-label rescue medication to their blinded&#xD;
      treatment regimen in order to treat ongoing hyperglycemia. Insulin may be used as rescue, at&#xD;
      the Investigator's discretion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pre-specified glycemic criteria, based upon self-monitored blood glucose (SMBG) FPG, or&#xD;
      single central laboratory FPG and repeat confirmatory FPG have been established during the&#xD;
      treatment period, starting at Week 6, and up to but not including the Week 52 visit, to&#xD;
      determine eligibility for open-label rescue medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample Size:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sample size for this study was selected to be consistent with the research hypotheses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dapagliflozin and saxagliptin will be compared with placebo separately. The Bonferroni method&#xD;
      to control the type 1 error rate across two comparisons with respect to the two groups of&#xD;
      research hypotheses (dapagliflozin vs placebo and saxagliptin vs placebo) will be used. No&#xD;
      comparisons between saxagliptin and dapagliflozin will be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sample size for this study is based on the ability to detect a 0.5% improvement over&#xD;
      placebo for dapagliflozin and saxagliptin in change from baseline in HbA1c at Week 26 (ST)&#xD;
      with at least 80% power for each comparison at a two sided alpha level of 0.025. Assuming a&#xD;
      standard deviation of 0.9% for change from baseline HbA1c at Week 26, a total of 237&#xD;
      pediatric subjects will be randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive dapagliflozin 5 mg (79&#xD;
      subjects), saxagliptin 2.5 mg (79 subjects), or placebo (79 subjects) respectively. Assuming&#xD;
      that 2% of subjectsdo not have a primary endpoint, a total of approximately 243 subjects will&#xD;
      be randomized. Randomization will be stratified based on the baseline anti-diabetic treatment&#xD;
      regimen (stable baseline dose of metformin [IR or XR]), a stable baseline dose of insulin, or&#xD;
      a stable combination of metformin [IR or XR] and insulin), gender, and age (10 to below 15&#xD;
      years of age, 15 to below 18 years of age).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The anticipated difference of 0.5% between each study drug (saxagliptin and dapagliflozin)&#xD;
      and placebo used in sample size estimation is consistent with estimates that were obtained in&#xD;
      adult clinical trials with saxagliptin or dapagliflozin as add on to anti-diabetic medication&#xD;
      where the primary endpoint was improvement in HbA1c after 24 weeks treatment. The standard&#xD;
      deviation estimate of 0.9% is consistent with estimates obtained in these adult studies as&#xD;
      well as with published estimates from pediatric trials of other anti-diabetic medications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analyses:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dapagliflozin and saxagliptin will be summarized separately. A common placebo group will be&#xD;
      included in each summary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, within the analyses of saxagliptin, the overall (combined low-dose and&#xD;
      high-dose) efficacy and safety analyses will be repeated for the subgroup of subjects on a&#xD;
      stable baseline dose of metformin (IR or XR) (with or without insulin). For these analyses,&#xD;
      the saxagliptin treatment regimens will be combined into one group and compared to the&#xD;
      (common) placebo group. P values corresponding to subgroup comparisons will be reported for&#xD;
      the primary and secondary efficacy endpoints, and will be reported at the nominal&#xD;
      significance level.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All efficacy analyses will be performed using the Randomized Subjects Data Set (all&#xD;
      randomized subjects who receive at least one dose of study medication during the treatment&#xD;
      period) unless otherwise specified.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following treatment regimens are considered for analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Low-dose/high-dose: Initial treatment of the low-dose followed by up-titrating to the&#xD;
           high-dose for those who do not achieve the glycemic target of HbA1c &lt;7% at week 12&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Low-dose: Initial treatment of the low-dose followed by continuing treatment on the&#xD;
           low-dose drug for those who do not achieve the glycemic target of HbA1c &lt;7% at week 12&#xD;
           For each drug, the primary comparison between the low-dose/high-dose and placebo&#xD;
           regimens will be tested at a two sided alpha level of 0.025.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary efficacy analysis will be performed using a weighted analysis of covariance&#xD;
      (ANCOVA). Separate models will be used for saxagliptin and dapagliflozin analyses, and each&#xD;
      analysis will include the (common) placebo control. Each model will have terms for baseline&#xD;
      value, treatment group, and randomization strata.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the comparison of the low-dose/high-dose treatment regimen versus placebo, all subjects&#xD;
      who had HbA1c&lt;7% at Week 12 and remained on the low-dose will get a weight of one. The&#xD;
      subjects who had HbA1c &gt;= 7% at Week 12 and continued on the low-dose will get a weight of 0.&#xD;
      The subjects who had HbA1c&gt;= 7% at Week 12 and received the high-dose will have a weight of&#xD;
      2. All subjects who do not undergo the second randomization and all placebo subjects will get&#xD;
      a weight of one. The intent-to-treat (ITT) estimand will be evaluated as the primary&#xD;
      estimand. Missing values for Week 26 will be imputed using the multiple imputation method.&#xD;
      The details of the imputation method will be presented in the statistical analysis plan.&#xD;
      Point estimates and 95% confidence intervals will be calculated based on maximum likelihood&#xD;
      for the adjusted mean changes within each treatment group as well as for the differences in&#xD;
      adjusted mean changes between treatment groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To assess the robustness of the primary efficacy analysis for the change in HbA1c from&#xD;
      baseline to Week 26, additional sensitivity analysis may be performed using the Evaluable&#xD;
      Subjects Data Set if &gt; 10% of the subjects in any treatment group in the Randomized Subjects&#xD;
      Data Set have relevant protocol deviations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary endpoint will also be compared between the low-dose treatment regimen and&#xD;
      placebo. In addition, up titrating to high-dose and continuing on low-dose will be compared&#xD;
      in the subset of saxagliptin and dapagliflozin subjects who had HbA1c &gt;= 7% at Week 12. These&#xD;
      analyses are described under secondary efficacy analyses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary efficacy analyses will also be performed separately for each drug (saxagliptin and&#xD;
      dapagliflozin). For each drug, the following sequential testing order will be employed to&#xD;
      control multiplicity of testing for the secondary objectives.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Comparison of mean reduction in HbA1c from baseline at Week 26 between the low-dose&#xD;
           treatment regimen and placebo&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Comparison of mean reduction in HbA1c from baseline at Week 26 between overall drug&#xD;
           treatment and placebo&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Comparison of mean reduction in FPG from baseline at Week 26 between the low&#xD;
           dose/high-dose treatment regimen and placebo&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Comparison of mean reduction in FPG from baseline at Week 26 between the low-dose&#xD;
           treatment regimen and placebo&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Comparison of mean reduction in FPG from baseline at Week 26 between overall drug&#xD;
           treatment and placebo&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Comparison of the percentage of subjects with baseline HbA1c&gt;= 7% who achieve an HbA1c&#xD;
           level &lt; 7.0% at Week 26 between the low-dose/high-dose treatment regimen and placebo&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Comparison of the percentage of subjects with baseline HbA1c &gt;= 7% who achieve an HbA1c&#xD;
           level &lt; 7.0% at Week 26 between the low-dose treatment regimen and placebo&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. Comparison of the percentage of subjects with baseline HbA1c &gt;= 7% who achieve an HbA1c&#xD;
           level &lt; 7.0% at Week 26 between overall drug treatment and placebo&#xD;
&#xD;
        9. Comparison of mean reduction in HbA1c from baseline at Week 26 between the high dose and&#xD;
           the low-dose in subjects who do not achieve an HbA1c &lt; 7% at Week 12&#xD;
&#xD;
       10. Comparison of mean reduction in FPG from baseline at Week 26 between the high dose and&#xD;
           the low-dose in subjects who do not achieve an HbA1c &lt; 7% at Week 12&#xD;
&#xD;
       11. Comparison of the percentage of subjects with baseline HbA1c &gt;= 7% who achieve an HbA1c&#xD;
           level &lt; 7.0% at Week 26 between the high-dose and the low-dose in subjects who do not&#xD;
           achieve an HbA1c &lt; 7% at Week 12 When the sequential testing stops for non-significance,&#xD;
           nominal p-values and adjusted means will be provided for the remaining comparisons.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For each drug, weighted ANCOVA analysis will be performed for the change from baseline in&#xD;
      HbA1c at Week 26 to compare the placebo and the low-dose treatment regimen. For this&#xD;
      analysis, all subjects who had HbA1c &lt; 7% at Week 12 and remained on the low-dose will get a&#xD;
      weight of one. The subjects who had HbA1c &gt;= 7% at Week 12 and continued on the low-dose will&#xD;
      get a weight of 2. The subjects who had HbA1c &gt;= 7% at Week 12 and received the high-dose&#xD;
      will have a weight of 0. All subjects who do not undergo the second randomization and all&#xD;
      placebo subjects will get a weight of one.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For subjects on saxagliptin and dapagliflozin and who had HbA1c &gt;= 7% at Week 12, the change&#xD;
      from baseline HbA1c at Week 26 (ST) will be compared between the subjects re-randomized to&#xD;
      remain on the low-dose and the subjects who are re-randomized to the high- dose using an&#xD;
      ANCOVA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Change from baseline of HbA1c at Week 26 (ST) will be compared also using a repeated measures&#xD;
      analysis between overall drug and placebo. For this analysis, both treatment regimens will be&#xD;
      combined into one treatment group for each drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Change from baseline at Week 26 (ST) in FPG will be analyzed similar to the primary weighted&#xD;
      analyses of change from baseline in HbA1c at Week 26.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proportion of subjects achieving HbA1c &lt; 7.0% at Week 26 (ST) will be analyzed using&#xD;
      weighted logistic regression with adjustment for the baseline HbA1c measurement and the&#xD;
      randomization strata. Weighting for the subjects will be applied similarly to a weighting in&#xD;
      the analysis of change from baseline in HbA1c. Subjects with missing a response at Week 26&#xD;
      will be imputed by dichotomizing the imputed values of HbA1c at Week 26.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The assessment of safety will be based on the analyses of AEs, vital signs, physical&#xD;
      examinations, electrocardiograms, hypoglycemia, DKA, safety laboratory evaluations, and&#xD;
      measures of growth and maturity. All safety analyses will be performed using the Treated&#xD;
      Subjects Data Set. Dapagliflozin and saxagliptin will be summarized separately. Treatment&#xD;
      regimens (low-dose or low-dose/high-dose) will be combined for saxagliptin and dapagliflozin&#xD;
      to provide the safety summary for overall saxagliptin and overall dapagliflozin compared to&#xD;
      placebo. A common placebo group will be included in each summary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measures of growth, bone and maturation markers will also be summarized for the combined ST +&#xD;
      LT + additional post study visit at Week 104.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Monitoring The Sponsor/designee representatives will review data centrally to identify&#xD;
      potential issues to determine a schedule of on-site visits for targeted review of study&#xD;
      records.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Representatives of the Sponsor (or designee) must be allowed to visit all study site&#xD;
      locations periodically to assess the data quality and study integrity. On site they will&#xD;
      review study records and directly compare them with source documents, discuss the conduct of&#xD;
      the study with the Investigator, and verify that the facilities remain acceptable.Off-site&#xD;
      monitoring visits and remote source data verification are allowed when restrictions due to&#xD;
      the COVID-19 pandemic prevent on site visits (e.g., monitors may not be able to access the&#xD;
      sites in a timely manner). Should this occur, it should be documented and the reasons be&#xD;
      available for review by the Sponsor and during inspections by any Regulatory Authorities In&#xD;
      addition, the study may be evaluated by the Sponsor (or designee) internal auditors and&#xD;
      government inspectors who must be allowed access to Case Report Forms (CRFs), source&#xD;
      documents, other study files, and study facilities. The Sponsor (or designee) audit reports&#xD;
      will be kept confidential.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigator must notify the Sponsor (or designee) promptly of any inspections scheduled&#xD;
      by regulatory authorities, and promptly forward copies of inspection reports to the&#xD;
      Sponsor/designee.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Records Retention The investigator must retain all study records and source documents for the&#xD;
      maximum period required by applicable regulations and guidelines, or institution procedures,&#xD;
      or for the period specified by the Sponsor/designee, whichever is longer. The investigator&#xD;
      must contact the Sponsor/designee prior to destroying any records associated with the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Sponsor/designee will notify the Investigator when the study records are no longer&#xD;
      needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the Investigator withdraws from the study (e.g., relocation, retirement), the records&#xD;
      shall be transferred to a mutually agreed upon designee (e.g., another investigator, IRB).&#xD;
      Notice of such transfer will be given in writing to the Sponsor/designee.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Drug Records&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is the responsibility of the Investigator to ensure that a current disposition record of&#xD;
      study drug (inventoried and dispensed) is maintained at the study site to include&#xD;
      Investigational Products (IPs). Except where the IP has to be sent directly to the subjects'&#xD;
      homes due to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID 19) pandemic. Any unused IP sent directly to&#xD;
      subjects' homes should be returned to the site at the next on-site visit.Records or logs must&#xD;
      comply with applicable regulations and guidelines and should include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Amount received and placed in storage area&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Amount currently in storage area&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Label identification number or batch number&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Amount dispensed to and returned by each subject, including unique subject identifiers&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Amount transferred to another area/site for dispensing or storage&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Non study disposition (e.g., lost, wasted)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Amount destroyed at study site, if applicable&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Amount returned to the Sponsor/designee&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Retain samples for bioavailability/bioequivalence, if applicable&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Dates and initials of person responsible for IP dispensing/accountability, as per the&#xD;
           Delegation of Authority Form The Sponsor/designee will provide forms to facilitate&#xD;
           inventory control if the investigational site does not have an established system that&#xD;
           meets these requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Case Report Forms An investigator is required to prepare and maintain adequate and accurate&#xD;
      case histories designed to record all observations and other data pertinent to the&#xD;
      investigation on each individual treated or entered as a control in the investigation. Data&#xD;
      that are derived from source documents and reported on the CRF must be consistent with the&#xD;
      source documents or the discrepancies must be explained. Additional clinical information may&#xD;
      be collected and analyzed in an effort to enhance understanding of product safety. Case&#xD;
      report forms may be requested for AEs and/or laboratory abnormalities that are reported or&#xD;
      identified during the course of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For sites using the Sponsor/designee's Electronic Data Capture (EDC) tool, electronic CRFs&#xD;
      will be prepared for all data collection fields except for fields specific to SAEs and&#xD;
      pregnancy, which will be reported on the electronic SAE form and Pregnancy Surveillance Form,&#xD;
      respectively. If electronic SAE form is not available, a paper SAE form can be used. Spaces&#xD;
      may be left blank only in those circumstances permitted by study-specific CRF completion&#xD;
      guidelines provided by the Sponsor/designee.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The confidentiality of records that could identify subjects must be protected, respecting the&#xD;
      privacy and confidentiality rules in accordance with the applicable regulatory&#xD;
      requirement(s).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigator will maintain a signature sheet to document signatures and initials of all&#xD;
      persons authorized to make entries and/or corrections on CRFs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The completed CRF, including any paper or electronic SAE/pregnancy CRFs, must be promptly&#xD;
      reviewed, signed, and dated by the Investigator or qualified physician who is a&#xD;
      co-investigator and who is delegated this task on the Delegation of Authority Form. For&#xD;
      electronic CRFs, review and approval/signature is completed electronically through the&#xD;
      Sponsor/designee's EDC tool. The investigator must retain a copy of the CRFs including&#xD;
      records of the changes and corrections.Data entered in the eCRF that are transcribed from&#xD;
      source documents must be consistent with the source documents or the discrepancies must be&#xD;
      explained.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each individual electronically signing electronic CRFs must meet Sponsor/designee training&#xD;
      requirements and must only access the Sponsor/designee's EDC tool using the unique user&#xD;
      account provided by the Sponsor/designee. User accounts are not to be shared or reassigned to&#xD;
      other individuals.&#xD;
