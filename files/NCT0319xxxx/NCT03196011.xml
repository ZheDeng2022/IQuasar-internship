  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      As many as 20% of patients are unhappy with the results of total knee replacement (TKR).&#xD;
      Various changes to surgical technique have tried to address this but have not led to a&#xD;
      significant improvement in the numbers of patients satisfied with their operation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently, attention has focussed on alignment of the leg. When viewed from the front, a&#xD;
      number of people do not start with a straight, mechanically aligned leg. Traditionally, when&#xD;
      implanting a knee replacement, the surgeon tries to put the shin bone half of the knee&#xD;
      replacement perpendicular to the floor to equalise stresses on the in and outside of the&#xD;
      joint. However, this may result in the alignment of the leg changing considerably, straining&#xD;
      the soft tissues around the knee and contributing to dissatisfaction with TKR.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There has been a move by some surgeons to change practice, and to implant the TKR in a way&#xD;
      that replicates the alignment of the patient's own original knee- alternative alignment.&#xD;
      Studies looking at alternative alignment have not shown any loss of satisfaction with results&#xD;
      of TKR and indeed are showing some signs that in the short term, function of the knee may be&#xD;
      better with the new technique.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research team are planning to run a study comparing the knee replacement used in Exeter-&#xD;
      the Triathlon- when put in place using traditional alignment versus using the alternative&#xD;
      alignment methods. The outcomes will be assessed in various ways including patient&#xD;
      satisfaction questionnaires, measuring muscle strength, flexibility around the knee, and by&#xD;
      assessments of alignment of the new knee on X-rays and Computerised Tomography scans. The&#xD;
      research team will look at short term results for satisfaction and function of the knee, and&#xD;
      in the long term look at wear and survivorship to see if patient satisfaction with TKR can be&#xD;
      improved.&#xD;

      Research Question:&#xD;
&#xD;
      When performing total knee replacement (TKR), does the use of the alternative alignment&#xD;
      method result in improved function by comparison to a group undergoing the same procedure but&#xD;
      using traditional technique? Primary Aim: To identify if the group undergoing TKR using&#xD;
      alternative alignment method have a significantly improved functional outcome at 1 year when&#xD;
      assessed by the Minimal Clinically Important Difference (MCID) of at least 5 points in the&#xD;
      Oxford Knee Score (OKS) by comparison to the group using traditional alignment technique.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Aims: To identify if the use of alternative alignment method when performing TKR&#xD;
      results in:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Shortened length of stay (LOS) in hospital&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Improved short term function when assessed by peak quadriceps or hamstrings muscle&#xD;
           torque measured by myometer&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Lower hospital costs as a result of reduced LOS or operating time&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Enhanced improvement in patient outcome scores Knee Osteo-arthritis Outcome Score&#xD;
           (KOOS), Oxford Knee Score (OKS), Euroquol (EQ5D) at short, mid and long term timeframes&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Enhanced positioning of the implants as assessed by a Computerised Tomography (CT) scan&#xD;
           rotational profile assessment&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Enhanced range of knee flexion&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Any significant differences in component positioning, limb alignment or component wear&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Any significant changes in functional ability as measured by the Exeter Functional Lab&#xD;
           protocol or Nurture activity assessment tool or the Instride Accelerometer by comparison&#xD;
           to the TKR performed with traditional instruments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research team will achieve these aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  By enrolling 126 patients into this study over a period of 2 years&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  By carrying out a prospective randomised study looking at the subject matter over a&#xD;
           period of 8 years&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  By analysing patients functional status pre and post-surgery using patient generated&#xD;
           questionnaires and data from the Exeter functional lab&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  By analysing patients the 1 year radiological results from the plain x-rays to look at&#xD;
           limb alignment, component position and wear&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  By analysing the TKR component position on the pre and post-operative Computerised&#xD;
           Tomography (CT) scans&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  By collecting length of stay data taken from the patient administration system&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  By collating all of the data from the study into a spread sheet for analysis by a&#xD;
           professional statistician&#xD;
&#xD;
      Scientific Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite being one of the most successful of orthopaedic operations, a number of patients&#xD;
      remain dissatisfied after TKR surgery. In a study of 253 patients, 1 year after TKR, Noble et&#xD;
      al reported 11% of patients were neutral in their satisfaction after their surgery and 14%&#xD;
      reported that they were either dissatisfied (3%) or very dissatisfied (11%). Reasons for this&#xD;
      are not always clear.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Various changes to surgical technique have tried to address this over the years. These&#xD;
      include computer assisted navigation and patient specific knee replacement parts. However, to&#xD;
      Brin et al, the clinical significance of this remains to be proven.&#xD;
&#xD;
      More recently, attention has focussed on the alignment of the leg. Classic mechanical&#xD;
      alignment (MA) in TKR is meant to co-align the prosthetic components to the mechanical axes&#xD;
      of the femur and tibia and restore neutral overall limb alignment. Traditionally, surgeons&#xD;
      have believed that implant durability is maximized when postoperative limb alignment is&#xD;
      corrected to 0 ± 3 degrees relative to the mechanical axis. When implanting the tibial&#xD;
      component of a TKR, the surgeon will try and put the device perpendicular to the tibial&#xD;
      mechanical axis. This is done make sure the stresses on the new knee are equally placed on&#xD;
      either side of the joint to try and prevent asymmetrical or accelerated wear on one side of&#xD;
      the prosthesis. However, Bellemans et al examined 250 asymptomatic volunteers and identified&#xD;
      that 32% of men and 17% of women have a varus deformity of the knee. Therefore, for many&#xD;
      people, placement of the tibial component perpendicular to the tibial mechanical axis may&#xD;
      result in the alignment of the leg changing considerably, putting new strains on the soft&#xD;
      tissues around the knee itself as well as altering the biomechanics of the adjacent ankle and&#xD;
      hip joints with the potential to generate soft tissue strain in these areas also. It is&#xD;
      possible that this alignment change is a major contributing factor to the dissatisfaction of&#xD;
      some patients with TKR.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Concerns that a failure to achieve &quot;correct&quot; positioning of the TKR components may adversely&#xD;
      affect the survivorship of the artificial joint may not be well founded. Bonner et al&#xD;
      reported upon the survivorship 501 TKRs after 15 years of follow up. 396 implants were within&#xD;
      3° of the mechanical axis and 105 were not. Whilst this latter group may have been expected&#xD;
      to have performed inferiorly, the results showed no statistically significant difference in&#xD;
      the survivorship of the 2 groups when revision for aseptic loosening was used as the end&#xD;
      point for the analysis. Similarly, Parratte et al reviewed 398 TKR cases in whom 292 had&#xD;
      post-operative limb alignment within 0-3° of the mechanical axis and 106 were outside of&#xD;
      this. The authors concluded that a postoperative mechanical axis of 0° ± 3° did not improve&#xD;
      the fifteen-year implant survival rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Surgeons such as Waterson et al are therefore now questioning the old philosophy of&#xD;
      alignment. There has been a move to change surgical practice and put the knee replacement&#xD;
      parts in place in a way that replicates the alignment of the patient's own original&#xD;
      knee-natural, alternative or kinematic alignment (KA). Importantly, several studies looking&#xD;
      at this KA have not shown any loss of satisfaction with results of knee replacement, and show&#xD;
      some signs that in the short term, function of the knee may be better with the new technique.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Waterson et al reported 1 year follow up data in 71 patients undergoing TKR randomised to&#xD;
      either KA (n = 36) or MA (n = 35). No significant differences were found between them in&#xD;
      function one year post-operatively. The authors recommended further research is required to&#xD;
      see if any theoretical long-term functional benefits of KA are realised or if there are any&#xD;
      potential effects on implant survival. Interestingly, in this work, there was a greater&#xD;
      improvement in the mean American Knee Society Score (AKSS) in the KA group at six weeks when&#xD;
      compared with the MA group (p = 0.05). The measurements of peak torque in the quadriceps were&#xD;
      also significantly better in the KA group at six weeks and three months (p = 0.003 and p =&#xD;
      0.02 respectively) by comparison to the MA group. Whilst this randomised control trial failed&#xD;
      to demonstrate any discernible difference between TKRs implanted in KA or MA at 1 year, the&#xD;
      authors recommended mid- to longer-term follow-up to confirm the equivocal functional outcome&#xD;
      and that survival of the TKR is not compromised by KA relative to MA. This new study takes&#xD;
      this concept further using manual instruments to try and achieve KA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mizner et al reported deficits in quadriceps force of 30-40% in patients for up to a year&#xD;
      after TKR by comparison to age matched subjects. They describe reduction of quadriceps muscle&#xD;
      performance has been correlated with fall risk, walking speed, speed and quality of&#xD;
      sit-to-stand transfers, and performance during stair climbing in individuals older than 60&#xD;
      years of age. Such functional deficits can impact significantly on quality of life and this&#xD;
      functional reduction could be a contributory factor to the dissatisfaction with TKR reported&#xD;
      by some patients. Bade et al identified similar reductions in quadriceps strength after TKR&#xD;
      at 1 and 3 months post-op that took 6 months to recover to pre-operative levels. Again, this&#xD;
      can have implications for functional recovery and satisfaction. If Waterson's work on KA&#xD;
      versus MA shows improvements in early quadriceps function, then it is important to see if&#xD;
      this can be progressed further and translated into improved function and satisfaction after&#xD;
      TKR.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dossett et al reported the results of their work and evaluated an alternative alignment&#xD;
      method (KA with patient-specific cutting guides) compared to the alignment results with MA&#xD;
      with conventional instruments. This was a randomized controlled trial of 41 KA and 41 MA&#xD;
      patients. In this work, the authors point out that because a mechanically aligned TKR strives&#xD;
      to correct limb alignment to a straight line, the kinematics of the knee can be altered. They&#xD;
      outline the principle behind KA i.e. placement of the components so that the orthogonal 3-D&#xD;
      orientation of the 3 axes that describe normal knee kinematics is restored to that of the&#xD;
      pre-arthritic knee. Two of their secondary outcome measures showed results in favour of the&#xD;
      KA knee: The Oxford Score (OKS-0 is best and 48 worst) was 8 in the KA group and 15 in the MA&#xD;
      group, a difference of 7 points, which was significant (P.001). The range of knee flexion was&#xD;
      120° in the kinematically aligned group and 115° in the MA group, a difference of 5°, which&#xD;
      was significant (P .043).&#xD;
&#xD;
      It was also of interest that in the Dossett paper the operative time in the kinematically&#xD;
      aligned group was 21 minutes less than the mechanically aligned group (P&lt;000).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the short term at least, it would appear that KA of TKR components has the potential to&#xD;
      deliver improvements in patient generated outcomes, quadriceps torque and flexibility of the&#xD;
      knee which in theory could increase the number of patients satisfied with TKR. Concern about&#xD;
      longer term failure of TKR if MA is not rigorously pursued appears to have been allayed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A study examining short, medium and longer term outcomes of KA, with a contemporary TKR&#xD;
      design is needed to see if outcomes for patients scan be improved. This study has the&#xD;
      potential to be of great importance in contributing to this question. Limb alignment has&#xD;
      focussed on the need to achieve the zero degree goal of hip, knee and ankle alignment. To&#xD;
      achieve real 3 dimensional (3D) more natural alignment, surgeons have to accept this goal may&#xD;
      not be correct. There is a need to achieve pre-arthritic/pre-morbid alignment and to evaluate&#xD;
      if this can unlock the potential for improved patient outcomes. A prospective, randomised&#xD;
      study with multiple outcome measures can deliver a major contribution to the knowledge base&#xD;
      of this subject and influence surgical practice with the aim of improving patient outcomes&#xD;
      and satisfaction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will be carried out at a single centre: The Exeter Knee Reconstruction Unit (EKRU)&#xD;
      at the Royal Devon and Exeter (RD+E) Hospital. Different parts of the study will be carried&#xD;
      out in the operating theatres, orthopaedic out-patients department and the physiotherapy&#xD;
      department.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participant Selection:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study participants will be undergoing TKR under the care of the EKRU at the RD+E Hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be identified as potential participants in 1 of 2 ways. Firstly, by their&#xD;
      surgeon when they are listed for TKR surgery. The surgeon will outline the study, provide the&#xD;
      patient with the study patient information leaflet and a copy of the study consent form and&#xD;
      ask permission from the patient to allow one of the research team to contact them.&#xD;
      Alternatively, they will be identified from the current surgical waiting list as suitable for&#xD;
      inclusion. In this latter case, their surgeon will write to the patient requesting permission&#xD;
      for one of the research team to contact them by telephone to discuss the study and to enquire&#xD;
      if the patient would enrol. A patient information leaflet about the study will accompany this&#xD;
      letter.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patient will have an opportunity to provisionally agree or decline enrolment during this&#xD;
      telephone call.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Written consent for participation will be obtained on a study specific Ethics Committee&#xD;
      approved consent form on attendance at the hospital for the pre-operative CT scan. The&#xD;
      pre-operative data will be collected including: demographics and medical history, Knee&#xD;
      Osteo-arthritis Outcome Score (KOOS), Oxford Knee Score (OKS), the Euroquol 5 Dimension&#xD;
      Questionnaire (EQ5D) score, the Forgotten Knee Score (FKS) and the Knee Society Score (KSS),&#xD;
      the SF36, the University of California at Los Angeles (UCLA) activity score, pain&#xD;
      measurements by Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) during rest and activity and detail of the use of&#xD;
      pain medication. The research team member will assess participants overall joint flexibility&#xD;
      using the Beighton scale. An assessment of pre-operative anxiety and depression will be made&#xD;
      via the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) 3 copies of written consent will be&#xD;
      obtained- one original and 2 photocopies. The original will be kept by the research team in&#xD;
      the study masterfile, one will be returned to the patient and one will be placed in the&#xD;
      medical notes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Routine care for these patients from their clinic appointment includes X-ray of the affected&#xD;
      knee, full leg alignment X-ray, and an assessment of their active and passive range of motion&#xD;
      of the knee.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All information collected pre-operatively will be used to quantify the sample population and&#xD;
      compare post-operative progression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pre-operative Radiological Assessment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to routine care, all study participants will undergo 1) a pre-operative CT scan&#xD;
      of the affected leg (spiral CT through the hip, knee and ankle) and 2) a whole leg&#xD;
      antero-posterior (AP) radiograph standing on one leg (the leg about to have a TKR and&#xD;
      involved in the study) and 3) a lateral &quot;heel-hang&quot; X-ray of the knee for surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pre-operative Functional Assessment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study participants will attend the Functional Lab in the physiotherapy department at the RD+E&#xD;
      Hospital for an assessment of their functional ability using the Exeter Functional lab&#xD;
      protocol and the Nurture and Instride devices.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomisation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This will be a randomised, prospective, blinded study with 2 arms of 63 patients each. Arm 1&#xD;
      will receive a Triathlon TKR implanted using the traditional/MA method and arm 2 will receive&#xD;
      a Triathlon TKR using the KA/alternative alignment method. The randomization schedule will be&#xD;
      determined using an on-line random assignment sequence generator&#xD;
      (www.graphpad.com/quickcalcs/randomize1.cfm), kept and controlled by the study co-ordinator.&#xD;
      Randomisation assignment will be transcribed onto paper, and placed inside a sealed opaque&#xD;
      envelope.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Any deviation from the assigned treatment group by a surgeon will be reported as a deviation&#xD;
      from protocol and the case will be terminated from the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample Size:&#xD;
&#xD;
      126 patients (63 per arm). The sample size was determined using the primary outcome measure,&#xD;
      OKS measured at 12-month follow-up, which has a Minimal Clinically Important Difference&#xD;
      (MCID) of 5 units (Clement et al). To detect a between group mean difference of 5 units, with&#xD;
      90% power and significance threshold of 0.05, using a standard deviation in both groups of&#xD;
      7.6 (Clement et al), requires 50 participants per group. Assuming 20% attrition, 63&#xD;
      participants per group are required.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Admission to Hospital for Surgery and Hospital Stay: will occur in the routine way as for all&#xD;
      patients undergoing TKR in this hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All surgeries will be carried out using the MAKO robotic arm system to ensure accurate bony&#xD;
      cuts and implant placement is achieved.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post-operative Follow Up:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be reviewed at 6 weeks, 3 and 6 months, 1, 2 and 5 years&#xD;
           post-operatively. (3 and 6 month appointments in addition to routine care).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The 6 post-operative visits for functional testing are in addition to routine care.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The study will terminate at 5 years after which patients will return to the usual&#xD;
           post-operative management schedule of a further review 10 years post-operatively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post-operative Radiological Assessment:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will undergo X-ray examination of the knee post-operatively whilst in&#xD;
           hospital and then at 1, 2 and 5 years- as per routine care&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will undergo one post-op spiral CT scan examination of the affected leg at&#xD;
           approximately 6 weeks after surgery (spiral CT through hip, knee and ankle) and a repeat&#xD;
           of the whole leg AP radiograph standing on one leg (the leg that has just had a TKR and&#xD;
           is involved in the study) at 1 year post-operatively. This is in addition to routine&#xD;
           care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Surgery:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Operating techniques will be standard techniques as used by the 4 experienced TKR surgeons&#xD;
      involved in the study with the exception of the alignment of the components which will be&#xD;
      decided upon in the randomisation schedule for use of the traditional MA or the KA method.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The use of the MAKO robotic arm system will be in all cases. All components will be cemented&#xD;
      in situ using the Triathlon Cruciate Retaining (CR) Implant with an X3 polyethylene insert.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patellae will be resurfaced. After surgery, patients will be discharged home allowed to&#xD;
      fully weight-bear as comfort allows and with walking aids for use for a 6 week period if&#xD;
      required. All patients will be instructed in an exercise regime whilst in hospital which they&#xD;
      will continue after discharge and post-operative out-patient physiotherapy will be provided&#xD;
      on an as needed basis- treatment type and frequency will be decided upon by the individual&#xD;
      physiotherapist seeing each patient reflectinfg the care given to TKR patients in the region.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Blinding:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following people will be blinded as to which arm of the study the patient is allocated&#xD;
      to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The patient&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The functional assessor in the physiotherapy department&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The physiotherapist providing post-operative physiotherapy&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The radiologist reporting the CT scans&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The 2 surgeons reporting the X-ray findings-no surgeon will report on his or her own&#xD;
           patients&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Collation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To be undertaken by the clinician undertaking the specific procedure concerned. The research&#xD;
      coordinator or the research nurses attached to the RD+E Hospital R+D department will collect&#xD;
      the pre-op consent, the pre and post-op Patient recorded Outcome Measures (PROMs). Data will&#xD;
      be entered on to the study database by them the accuracy of entry double checked by them i.e.&#xD;
      one person enters the data and a second checks its accuracy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RD+E Hospital physiotherapists will be responsible for collection of the Functional&#xD;
      Assessment data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The 4 surgeons will be responsible for clinic data and communications, operation note&#xD;
      details, reporting on X-ray findings- all of these to be on the hospital Clinical&#xD;
      Documentation Management (CDM) system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dr Anaspure will report the CT scan findings. All data will be stored on RD+E NHSFT secure&#xD;
      computers. Data will be entered into an Excel spreadsheet for later transfer into a&#xD;
      statistical package such as Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) version 24,&#xD;
      for analysis. All patient identifiers will be removed. At the end of the study, when all&#xD;
      analysis of the data has been completed, the study data will be archived as per the sponsor's&#xD;
      archiving Standard Operating Procedures (SOP).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis. The research team will arrange for independent statistical analysis of&#xD;
      the results by Dr. Fiona Warren from the University of Exeter Clinical Trials Unit (CTU).&#xD;
&#xD;
      All outcomes will be reported descriptively by group, with continuous outcomes reported as&#xD;
      mean (standard deviation) or median (interquartile range).&#xD;
&#xD;
      All continuous outcome measures, including the primary outcome (OKS) will be analysed using&#xD;
      linear regression modelling with adjustment for randomisation variables (surgeon, severity&#xD;
      based on baseline OKS, and age (below 70, 70 and above), and baseline measurement. EQ5D will&#xD;
      be analysed using the equivalent analyses with Tobit regression. Between group comparisons&#xD;
      will be reported using confidence intervals and p-values.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For continuous measures recorded at multiple time points, hierarchical regression models will&#xD;
      be used to assess the interaction between intervention and timepoint, with the interaction&#xD;
      effect reported as a global p-value.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All analyses will be reported using the intention to treat principle. The primary analyses&#xD;
      will include complete case data only. The amount of missing data will be reported for all&#xD;
      outcome variables. In the event of substantive missing data (more than 5%), a secondary&#xD;
      analysis will be performed including observed data and missing data imputed using multiple&#xD;
      chained equations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Timescale:&#xD;
&#xD;
      EKRU carry out 25 TKR procedures per month. The research team understand that studies have,&#xD;
      on average, 54% of potential participants who choose not to be part of the research and&#xD;
      believe it is reasonable to recruit 11 cases per month. However, will be allowed to achieve&#xD;
      the sample size of 126 in case recruitment is slower than anticipated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each patient will remain part of the study for approximately 5 years. Total duration of the&#xD;
      study will be 8 years. (2 years to recruit participants, 5 years of follow up and data&#xD;
      collection and one further year for data collation, cleansing and evaluation, statistical&#xD;
      analysis and writing up of the study findings).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dissemination of Results:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be informed in writing of the results if they so desire. The (R+D) Office&#xD;
      at the RD+E Hospital will be informed of the results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The results of this research will be presented both nationally and internationally at knee&#xD;
      surgery conferences, and published in a peer reviewed journal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Impact of Research:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Unknown. If the research identifies a clear advantage of one study arm over the others, then&#xD;
      it is likely that this technique will become standard TKR procedure in the EKRU- with the aim&#xD;
      of providing patients with the best clinical and functional results after TKR surgery.&#xD;
      Similarly, if a clear difference is found in one study arm, one would hope that presentation&#xD;
      of the results to colleagues at other institutions will result in better long term results&#xD;
      for their patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the event that no technique proves superior to the others, then this will provide surgeons&#xD;
      with the reassurance that no matter what their preferred technique, their patient is not&#xD;
      being disadvantaged.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If one arm of the study out performs the other in clinical and functional results, there may&#xD;
      also be cost differences between the arms of the study which could result in cost savings for&#xD;
      the NHS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Costs:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The EKRU has signed a Masters Service Agreement with Stryker UK to support its research&#xD;
      projects. The study will remain an investigator initiated one, independent of influence of&#xD;
      Stryker. As such all anticipated costs of the study will be covered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measures to avoid bias:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The patients will be blinded as to which arm of the study they are allocated to.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The operating surgeon cannot be blinded to randomisation as he will be performing the&#xD;
           surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The member of staff interpreting the results of the CT scan (Dr Anaspure) will be&#xD;
           blinded as to which group the patients are allocated to&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The physiotherapist carrying out the functional assessments will be blinded to study arm&#xD;
           allocation as will the physiotherapists carrying out post-operative out-patient&#xD;
           rehabilitation&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  No surgeon will report upon the x-rays of a patient upon whom he/she operated&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The statistician analysing the results will be blinded to study arm allocation&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient involvement:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study research team have consulted with patients on the feasibility of participating in&#xD;
      the study at all and in particular about the demands of attending the appointments for&#xD;
      functional assessment and CT scans. The study was discussed at the EKRU patient research&#xD;
      panel. (This panel is a group of patients who have undergone knee replacement surgery in this&#xD;
      Unit and who are therefore, well placed to comment on the practicalities of study&#xD;
      involvement, as well as on the appropriateness and clarity of the patient information&#xD;
      leaflet.) Attendance at all time frames is critical for completion of the secondary measure&#xD;
      functional outcome and it was stressed by the patient representatives that the patients need&#xD;
      to be fully informed of the commitment required should they agree to take part. Similarly, it&#xD;
      was recommended that the extra commitment for CT scan appointments be highlighted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bi-annual meetings of the patient research panel are held and if issues arise when running&#xD;
      the study that require further patient involvement, they will be taken them to the panel for&#xD;
      consultation. If a meeting is not due for some time, a panel member will be contacted&#xD;
      personally for their advice. When the research team consulted on the design and wording of&#xD;
      the patient information leaflet and the consent form, various changes were recommended and&#xD;
      implemented.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Risks/Monitoring Adverse Events/Stopping the Study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A log of adverse events, serious adverse events, adverse device effects and serious adverse&#xD;
      device effects will be kept by the study coordinator. Any such event events occurring in the&#xD;
      immediate peri and post-operative events should be reported to the coordinator by the&#xD;
      consultant surgeon in charge of the case who will contact the study sponsor within the time&#xD;
      frames as specified by them. Similarly any such adverse events may be identified in clinic&#xD;
      and again, the surgeon concerned should report these back to the coordinator to be logged and&#xD;
      the sponsor will be informed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is possible that adverse events will occur that are dealt with either by the Accident and&#xD;
      Emergency (A+E) department, the patient's General Practitioner (GP) or other hospitals. These&#xD;
      may not be readily apparent to the research team. The operating surgeon will specifically ask&#xD;
      participants to inform the research team if any complications or adverse events occur at each&#xD;
      clinic attendance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A meeting of the research team will be held on a 3 monthly basis to discuss progress of the&#xD;
      study, any specific problems and to consider whether there are any justifications for&#xD;
      stopping the study. As both techniques being studied of performing TKR are already in use, it&#xD;
      is not anticipated that there will be an unexpected complication that would necessitate an&#xD;
      early termination of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethical considerations Ethical approval for this study will be sought from the National&#xD;
      Research Ethics Service and the Health Research Authority.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study coordinator has discussed the study with the radiological protection officer at the&#xD;
      RD+E Hospital who has provided radiation dose calculations as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients undergoing these total knee replacement operations in our hospital receive AP&#xD;
      and Lateral radiographs of the knee on 5 occasions (pre &amp; post op, at 1, 2 years and 5&#xD;
      years), 2 AP radiographs of both legs at pre-op &amp; 1 year. This is routine care. The total&#xD;
      dose arising from these examinations is 81 millisiverts (µSv) as described by the Health&#xD;
      Protection Agency Centre for Radiation, Chemicals and Environmental Hazards (HPA-CRCE) Report&#xD;
      012, 2010.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, patients enrolled in this trial will require 2 additional whole leg AP x-rays, 1&#xD;
      lateral x-ray of the knee and 2 CT scans covering the hip, knee and ankle. The total dose&#xD;
      that a patient participating in this trial will receive is 1.7mSv, of which 1.6mSv is in&#xD;
      addition to standard care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants are &gt;/= 60 years of age and pregnant women are excluded from the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The lifetime risk of developing a cancer resulting from the total radiation dose is 1 in&#xD;
      21,900 for a 60 year old patient; this would fall to 1 in 84,900 for an 80 year old patient.&#xD;
      For the ages of the expected cohort, this is considered to be a very low risk (HPA-CRCE-028,&#xD;
      2011 and NRPB, 2001) and is equivalent to around 8.5 months of natural background radiation&#xD;
      in the UK.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The lifetime risk of developing a cancer resulting from the excess dose in this trial is 1 in&#xD;
      23,000 for a 60 year old patient; this would fall to 1 in 93,800for an 80 year old patient.&#xD;
      For the ages of the expected cohort, this is considered to be a low risk (HPA-CRCE-028, 2011&#xD;
      and NRPB, 2001) and is equivalent to around 8 months of natural background radiation in the&#xD;
      UK.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With participants consent, the research team will send anonymised data regarding the&#xD;
      navigation findings during the operation, as well as CT and X-ray findings from pre-and&#xD;
      post-surgery to Stryker UK. This will be with the purpose of providing information to allow&#xD;
      the company to improve surgical technique, as well as implant and instrumentation design. No&#xD;
      personal identifiers will be used when this information is sent to Stryker UK&#xD;
&#xD;
      Conflicts of Interest:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stryker UK have supported this study financially. However, it remains completely independent&#xD;
      from them in study design, results and dissemination of findings. The 4 operating surgeons&#xD;
      all undertake consultancy work for Stryker UK and will complete the necessary applications&#xD;
      regarding this on the ethics application for this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Confidentiality All of the research staff are trained in the guidelines for Good Clinical&#xD;
      Practice (GCP) in research. All National Health Service (NHS) staff involved are bound by&#xD;
      patient confidentiality requirements of the NHS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study participants GP will be informed that their patient is involved in the research-&#xD;
      particularly as the patient may wish to discuss their involvement in the research with their&#xD;
      GP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All of the data associated with the study will be kept electronically on the hard drives of&#xD;
      computers within the Exeter Knee Reconstruction Unit (EKRU). It will be stored on encrypted&#xD;
      and password protected hospital computers. The data will only be accessible by members of the&#xD;
      research team and by the Research and Development (R+D) department at the RD+E Hospital who&#xD;
      will require access to the data to ensure compliance with the protocol and that all study&#xD;
      regulatory requirements are being met.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When the data is sent for statistical analysis, all personal identifiers will be removed and&#xD;
      a study number only used for identification.&#xD;
&#xD;
      No personal identifiers will be used when information about the navigation findings, and CT&#xD;
      scans and X-rays findings is sent to Stryker UK At the end of the study (see timescales&#xD;
      above), all research data will be archived as per our sponsors archiving SOP. Radiographs and&#xD;
      scans will remain on the secure hospital systems as per routine care.&#xD;
