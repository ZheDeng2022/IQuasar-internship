    <textblock>
      The study has 2 phases:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The Retrospective Phase (50 patients were diagnosed to have sepsis according to our&#xD;
           definition and criteria and 30 patients as a controlled cases )&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The Prospective Phase (600 patients who will be admitted and monitored in ICU in order&#xD;
           to get at least 30 sepsis cases, according to our definition and criteria).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measurements will be made from the forehead using the TTP's biocompatible sensor Unit that&#xD;
      will be attached to the skin. The SU will transfer data to the MCU.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      TTP™ system, which is composed of 2 parts:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  SU - a disposable Sensor Unit patch&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  MCU - e reusable Monitor Connecting Unit&#xD;
&#xD;
      The communication between the two units can be wired or wireless. The system to be used in&#xD;
      this study is wired and the two units were connected via a Sensor Unit Cable (SCU).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The SU is attached to the temple area by a biocompatible disposable adhesive. It measures&#xD;
      skin temperature across the temporal artery using several sensors, translates it to&#xD;
      electrical signals and transmits those signals to the MCU. The MCU translates the electrical&#xD;
      signals to core temperature using a special mathematical algorithm which overcomes the effect&#xD;
      of the ambient temperature as well as the thermal properties of a specific patient. The core&#xD;
      temperature as well as any concurrent error in the measurement process is displayed on the&#xD;
      screen of the MCU or transmitted to the hospital VSM. The MCU has a wired connection to the&#xD;
      hospital's VSM using Standard YSI400.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objectives of this clinical study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A first objective of the clinical study is to verify the findings of a previously&#xD;
           published study, relating to temperature pattern changes within patients who were&#xD;
           diagnosed having sepsis , prior to its occurrence.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A second objective is to examine the efficacy and safety of the TTP - a novel&#xD;
           non-invasive core temperature measurement system , as a measure for continues core&#xD;
           temperature monitoring.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A third objective of the study, is to examine the effectiveness of the TTP as a measure&#xD;
           for detection of temperature changes pattern and to correlate such changes with fever&#xD;
           related to infections such as sepsis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is estimated that the study with take 18 months to complete.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Type of Study&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A Retrospective phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A prospective phase&#xD;
&#xD;
      Temperature measurements Measurements will be made from the forehead using the TTP's&#xD;
      biocompatible sensor Unit that will be attached to the skin The SU will transfer data to the&#xD;
      MCU. The TTPTM system will be disinfected before use an alcohol-chlorhexidine solution.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The Retrospective Phase, screening temperature data logs of patients who had sepsis or&#xD;
           other fever related infection. Screening period shall be at least 72 hours prior to&#xD;
           sepsis or infection detection. This part shall include 50 sepsis cases and 30 non-sepsis&#xD;
           cases as a control.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The Prospective Phase, measuring core temperature with the TTP and comparing it with&#xD;
           existing technology such as rectal, esophageal or catheter or skin (by the case). The&#xD;
           temperature data taken from each patient who will have a sepsis or other fever related&#xD;
           infection will be analyzed to find any relation between the temperature pattern change&#xD;
           Any medical care decision (such as microbiology cultures, additional testing, etc) will&#xD;
           be made entirely according to existing reference standard of care. The TTP device will&#xD;
           not influence in any way on ICU physician' decision. The TTP device purpose is only to&#xD;
           record medical data for later evaluation and not to intertwine in medical care given to&#xD;
           participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This part shall include up to 600 patients who will be monitored and analyzed during their&#xD;
      stay in the ICU in order to get at least 30 sepsis cases.&#xD;
