    <measure>Number of Participants With Anterior Chamber Cell Grade 0 in Study Eye at Day 15 (Last Observation Carried Forward) in the Modified Intent to Treat (mITT) Population</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 15</time_frame>
    <description>Biomicroscopic measurement of anterior chamber cells was conducted in the surgery eye (study eye) by the same examiner from visit to visit whenever possible. A slit-lamp biomicroscope was used at x16 magnification with a 1 x 1 mm oblique high-intensity beam. Two cell counts were summed and divided by 2 to determine an average final anterior chamber cell count. This final cell count was converted to a grade: Grades 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 were assigned for cell counts of 0, 1 to 10, 11 to 20, 21 to 50, and &gt; 50, respectively. If the averaged count fell between two grades, the higher grade was selected (e.g., if the two counts were 10 and 11, the average of 10.5 fell into Grade 2). Missing anterior chamber cell grade at Day 15 was imputed by last non-missing scheduled post-baseline anterior chamber cell grade assessed prior to Day 15 (last observation carried forward).</description>

    <measure>Number of Participants Who Achieve a Pain Score of 0 on the Visual Analog Scale (VAS) (0-100 mm Scale) for Each Post-surgical Assessment at Days 1, 8, 15, 18, and 29</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1 to Day 29</time_frame>
    <description>Eye pain/discomfort in the study eye was evaluated at every visit except Visit 2 (Surgery; Day 0) using a VAS, scoring from 0 to 100 using a mark on a 100 mm line (0 = absent; 100 = maximum). Participants were asked to rate the feeling of the symptom in the study eye from absent to extreme by moving a slide on the side of the scale to align with images of descriptive faces.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants With Anterior Chamber Cell Grade 0 in Study Eye at Day 15 (Last Observation Carried Forward) in the Modified Intent to Treat (mITT) Population</title>
        <description>Biomicroscopic measurement of anterior chamber cells was conducted in the surgery eye (study eye) by the same examiner from visit to visit whenever possible. A slit-lamp biomicroscope was used at x16 magnification with a 1 x 1 mm oblique high-intensity beam. Two cell counts were summed and divided by 2 to determine an average final anterior chamber cell count. This final cell count was converted to a grade: Grades 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 were assigned for cell counts of 0, 1 to 10, 11 to 20, 21 to 50, and &gt; 50, respectively. If the averaged count fell between two grades, the higher grade was selected (e.g., if the two counts were 10 and 11, the average of 10.5 fell into Grade 2). Missing anterior chamber cell grade at Day 15 was imputed by last non-missing scheduled post-baseline anterior chamber cell grade assessed prior to Day 15 (last observation carried forward).</description>
