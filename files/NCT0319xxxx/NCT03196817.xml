  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) is the most common neuropathic compression syndrome of the upper&#xD;
      limbs, caused by compression of the median nerve in the wrist. There is no gold standard for&#xD;
      establishing the diagnosis of STC. The diagnosis can be based on clinical findings and&#xD;
      electrodiagnostic tests. Treatment options can be divided into surgical and non-surgical&#xD;
      procedures. Surgical interventions include open carpal tunnel release, mini incision or&#xD;
      release of the endoscopic carpal tunnel. Nonsurgical include daily activities modification,&#xD;
      oral anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), oral corticosteroids, splints, corticosteroid&#xD;
      injections or other options (laser therapy, ultrasound or acupuncture)&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to compare randomly, conservative treatment for CTS with night&#xD;
      splint of the wrist versus local infiltration of corticosteroids after a min-imum period of&#xD;
      six months follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be divided into two groups: night orthesis group that will receive the&#xD;
      prescription to purchase the orthesis and guide the use of it; and infiltration group of&#xD;
      patients will be referred to the Moema Alvorada Hospital to carry out infiltration. These&#xD;
      patients will be evaluated before application, one week, one month, three months and six&#xD;
      months after intervention.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will be developed in the service of medical residency of surgery and microsurgery&#xD;
      of the hand of Alvorada hospital (São Paulo - SP).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Study Design is Randomized clinical trial according to the CONSORT STATEMENT&#xD;
      (http://www.consort-statement.org) standards.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The number of participants will initially be 84 patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adult patients 40 years of age or older with four or more of the following clinical signs and&#xD;
      symptoms suggested by Graham et al. (CTS-6):&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Paresthesia in the territory of the median nerve.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Nocturnal paresthesia of the hand&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Atrophy of the tenar musculature&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Positive Tinel Signal&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Positive Phalen Test&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Loss of discrimination of 2 points&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will be diagnosed with electromyography (EMG). All participants will sign an&#xD;
      Research Ethics Committee of this institution, after reading and explaining the study&#xD;
      proposal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Criteria for non-inclusion:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Previous treatment with corticosteroids and felling in the last 6 months Previous surgical&#xD;
      treatment Associated traumatic or non-traumatic pathologies Hypersensitivity to&#xD;
      corticosteroids. CTS secondary to another pathology. Refusal to Research Ethics Committe.&#xD;
      Fixed paresthesia&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization and Allocation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The allocation of patients to the infiltration or nocturnal orthosis groups will be performed&#xD;
      using opaque and numbered envelopes on their outer face with consecutive numbers. The draw of&#xD;
      the method, for each envelope, will be done randomly and sequentially, using randomization&#xD;
      software (available at: http://www.random.org), after the randomization, the envelopes will&#xD;
      be sealed. The sealed envelope, containing the patient's allocation group, will be opened&#xD;
      only at the doctor's office after verification of the criteria for inclusion and signing of&#xD;
      the Research Ethics Committee signature. The randomization procedure was performed by a&#xD;
      person not directly involved in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sampe Size:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Considering the difference of 30% in the improvement of nocturnal paresthesia, 95% confidence&#xD;
      interval and statistical power of 80%, we calculated a sample of 84 patients. At 6 months&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interventions&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients included in this study will be attended at the Santa Cruz IV Ambulatory of hand&#xD;
      surgery outpatient clinic. Patients with a diagnosis of CTS will be referred for evaluation&#xD;
      in this outpatient clinic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After confirmation of the diagnosis of CTS with the presence of four or more of the six&#xD;
      criteria proposed by Graham and confirmation by the EMG and application of the inclusion and&#xD;
      non inclusion criteria in the study, eligible patients will be informed about the nature and&#xD;
      purpose of the study, by reading the Research Ethics Committee of this institution; after&#xD;
      signing will be registered. Only after signing the Research Ethics Committee and the&#xD;
      patient's registration will the opaque and sealed envelope containing the patient's&#xD;
      allocation be opened. Patients in the nocturnal orthoses group will receive prescriptions for&#xD;
      the purchase of the orthosis and guidance on use at the same moment of randomization.&#xD;
      Patients in the infiltration group will be referred to the Hospital Alvorada de Moema to&#xD;
      perform the infiltration at the same moment of randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Infiltration technique:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient seated, with elbow resting on the table, supine wrist, relaxed in dorsiflexion, after&#xD;
      asepsis and antisepsis care a needle will be inserted located on the ulnar border of the&#xD;
      radial flexor tendon of the carpus, with an angle of 30º directed to the carpal tunnel , with&#xD;
      an association of betamethasone dipropionate, betamethasone disodium phosphate {diprospan®},&#xD;
      plus lidocaine (xylocaina®).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Night immobilization:&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the night time, the patient will wear a forearm-palmar splint, where the wrist will&#xD;
      remain in the 15th degree of extension, until its removal in the morning. The nocturnal&#xD;
      orthosis should be used by study period .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcomes&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Outcomes:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Remission of nocturnal paresthesia after intervention - Evaluation to verify remission&#xD;
           of nocturnal paresthesia, referred by the patient at the time of initial care.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Boston Questionnaire (Levine):&#xD;
&#xD;
      A questionnaire developed for the purpose of evaluating the severity of symptoms and the&#xD;
      degree of manual ability of patients with CTS. This is a self-reported questionnaire that&#xD;
      assesses the severity of symptoms and the functional status of patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Outcome Measures:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Visual Analogue Scale - EVA Pain Evaluation - The analogical visual scale of pain is&#xD;
           formed by two bars, joined by a line with ten centimeters, that mark the beginning and&#xD;
           the end. The start bar is &quot;0&quot; and indicates no pain. The end bar is the &quot;10&quot; and&#xD;
           indicates the maximum pain. The patient was asked to register his pain with a stroke on&#xD;
           that line joining the two bars. The gauging of the pain was performed by measuring the&#xD;
           distance between the initial bar and the trait performed by the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Graham Criteria - CTS-6 Assessment of improvement of graham's cervix, which are signs&#xD;
           and symptoms used for the diagnosis of CTS&#xD;
