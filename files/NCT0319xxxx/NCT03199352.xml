  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The technique of laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) has evolved significantly over&#xD;
      the past few decades to minimize complication risks such as strictures. Three different&#xD;
      anastomotic techniques are currently widely used hand-sewn (HS), linear-stapled (LS) and&#xD;
      circular stapled (CS). Studies are contradictory as to the best technique to avoid&#xD;
      complications. Many studies have focused on the stricture and infection rates of these&#xD;
      procedures, and minimized the examination of ulceration, gastritis, and anastomotic leak. The&#xD;
      purpose of this study is to prospectively examine how the use of linear-stapled and hand-sewn&#xD;
      anastomotic techniques affect complication rates of marginal ulceration, gastritis, leak and&#xD;
      stricture in patients who undergo RYGB. The goal of this study is to compare the long-term&#xD;
      complication rates between hand-sewn robotic RYGB and linear-stapled laparoscopic RYGB.&#xD;
      Eligible patients are men and women age 19-65 who are to undergo RYGB, have a BMI between&#xD;
      35-45, and RYGB is the primary procedure. The main outcomes to be measured are complications&#xD;
      in marginal ulceration, gastritis, leak, and stricture rate at 2 and 6 weeks, and 3, 6, 9,&#xD;
      12, and 24 months postoperatively.&#xD;

      1. Screening and Informed Consent Subjects will be screened on a weekly basis for eligibility&#xD;
      of enrollment. If eligible, patients will be approached by study staff at the initial&#xD;
      surgical consultation. The purpose of the study and risks of the procedures will be explained&#xD;
      to the subject and the consent process must be documented accordingly in the medical record.&#xD;
      Subjects who agree to study participation must sign an IRB approved informed consent form.&#xD;
      Subjects will be informed that their participation in this study is voluntary and they may&#xD;
      refuse to participate or discontinue from the study at any time. Subjects will be given the&#xD;
      opportunity to ask the investigator questions so that they are adequately informed about the&#xD;
      research. A copy of the signed informed consent must be provided to the subject and the&#xD;
      informed consent process will be documented in source documents. If new information becomes&#xD;
      available that may affect a subject's decision to continue to take part in the study, this&#xD;
      information will be discussed with the subject by the investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Failure to meet submission requirements:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each patient will be required to meet their individual insurance companies requirements for&#xD;
      submission of bariatric surgery approval. Subjects who provide study consent but then do not&#xD;
      submit for insurance approval or are denied will be considered &quot;discontinued&quot; and will not&#xD;
      require additional study follow-up visits. The reason for the discontinuation will be clearly&#xD;
      delineated on the applicable case report form. Subjects in whom the robotic RYGB procedure is&#xD;
      begun but not completed will be considered &quot;discontinued&quot; once discharged from the hospital&#xD;
      and not require any additional study follow-up visits. Reasons for discontinuation will be&#xD;
      recorded in the case report form. Additionally, female patients of child bearing age will&#xD;
      undergo a standard of care pregnancy test at the time of the pre-operative surgical testing&#xD;
      (2/3 weeks before surgery) and always the morning of surgery by urine HCG.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Surgical Procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The operation will be performed per standard of care for both the laparoscopic RYGB and the&#xD;
      robotic RYGB. The main difference between the two procedures is that in the robotic&#xD;
      procedure, the intestinal anastomosis will be hand-sewn and in the laparoscopic RYGB, the&#xD;
      anastomosis will be performed using a linear staple. Subjects will be maintained on a&#xD;
      low-calorie diet for the first post-operative month, as per standard of care. In addition,&#xD;
      multivitamin supplements, calcium, and iron should be prescribed and maintained per standard&#xD;
      of care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Schedule:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be evaluated preoperatively, during the procedure, at discharge, and at 2&#xD;
      weeks, 6 weeks, 3 months, 6 months, 9 months, and 12 months. Assessments to be conducted/data&#xD;
      collected at each visit are listed below and in the study assessments table.&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
        5. Adverse Events Adverse events for all bariatric procedures are tracked within our&#xD;
           centers Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery Accreditation and Quality Improvement Program&#xD;
           (MBSAQIP) database. All bariatric centers accredited by the American Society for&#xD;
           Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery (ASMBS) are required to submit all bariatric surgery&#xD;
           data to the MBSAQIP database for quality review. Our bariatric surgery team has open&#xD;
           access to our centers data for quality review purposes and will compare adverse events&#xD;
           for the robotic and laparoscopic RYGB to the other procedures performed by our center.&#xD;
           Adverse events are categorized by organ system (wound, respiratory, urinary tract, CNS,&#xD;
           cardiac, or other) as specified by the MBSAQIP. Any post-operative occurrence within 30&#xD;
           days will be documented if related to the bariatric procedure. Bariatric related&#xD;
           readmission and reoperations are also tracked per MBSAQIP guidelines.&#xD;
