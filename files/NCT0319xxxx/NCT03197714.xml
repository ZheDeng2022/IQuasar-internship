      Phase Ib, open-label, dose-escalation clinical trial to evaluate the best-tolerated doses in&#xD;
      Acute Myeloid Leukaemia (AML) relapsed or refractory to chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This open-label, nonrandomized trial will comprise 2 stages. A dose escalation stage will&#xD;
      characterize the safety, tolerability and maximum tolerated dose (MTD), of OPB-111077.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subsequently, an expansion stage will further evaluate the safety and antitumor activity of&#xD;
      OPB-111077 in AML relapsed or refractory to chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Enrollment to the expansion cohort will begin following determination of the MTD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Approximately 6-12 patients will be included in the phase I part of this clinical trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additional patients will be included in the expansion cohort up to a total of 15 patients.&#xD;
      The expansion cohort will serve to further evaluate safety simultaneously with preliminary&#xD;
      efficacy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be selected and included in the study after testing the response to the drug&#xD;
      with the Vivia Biotech ex vivo CDx PharmaFlow PM test. PharmaFlow PM test is a companion&#xD;
      diagnostic (CDx) tool that provides a complete pharmacological profile for each individual,&#xD;
      allowing the detection of patients resistant to OPB-111077 and enriching the study in&#xD;
      patients that respond to the drug. The third of patients more sensitive to OPB-11077 wil be&#xD;
      included in the study.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The optimal management of relapsed AML in patients who are not candidates for HSCT has yet to&#xD;
      be delineated. Given the median age at which AML is diagnosed and the high incidence of&#xD;
      relapse and significant toxicities associated with standard intensive remission induction&#xD;
      chemotherapy, new treatment options are needed to optimize AML outcomes. Changes on&#xD;
      metabolism are critical in Acute Myeloid Leukaemia (AML); besides, leukemic cells have high&#xD;
      requirements of energy and high basal metabolism. For this reason we hypothesized that&#xD;
      deregulations of energy metabolism and mitochondria could play a central role in AML.&#xD;
      OPB-111077, a novel low-molecular-weight compound discovered by Otsuka Pharmaceutical Co,&#xD;
      Ltd, is a new class drug targeting cancer cell metabolisms and STAT3 and is being developed&#xD;
      as an orally active antitumor agent for the treatment of various cancers. Sufficient&#xD;
      preclinical studies have shown its activity in several types of tumors and especially in AML.&#xD;
      Although in a phase I study their activity has been small in a group solid tumor, we may&#xD;
      hypostatize that this drug could be more efficient in tumor cells with a high proliferative&#xD;
      index as AML.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an open-label, phase Ib dose-escalation clinical trial to evaluate the safety and&#xD;
      tolerability of oral OPB-111077 in AML relapsed or refractory to chemotherapy patients.&#xD;
      OPB-111077 will be administered orally on a once daily dose schedule.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This open-label, nonrandomized trial will comprise 2 stages. A dose escalation stage will&#xD;
      characterize the safety, tolerability and MTD, of OPB-111077. Subsequently, an expansion&#xD;
      stage will further evaluate the safety and antitumor activity of OPB-111077 in AML relapsed&#xD;
      or refractory to chemotherapy. The overall response rate of OPB-11077 in acute myeloid&#xD;
      leukemia and its correlation with the ex-vivo PharmaFlow PM test will be also assessed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Enrollment to the expansion cohort will begin following determination of the MTD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OPB-111077 recommended dose for expansion cohort will be defined during the phase I as MTD.&#xD;
      Intra patient dose escalation is not allowed at any time of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be included in the study upon signed informed consent and will follow study&#xD;
      procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two dose schemas will be employed:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Level 1: 200 mg daily&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Level 2: 250 mg daily The starting dose level of oral OPB-111077 will be 200 mg od. A 3&#xD;
           + 3 dose-escalation scheme will be used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A minimum of 3 patients will be initially enrolled per cohort. DLTs will be assessed during&#xD;
      the DLT assessment window of 28 days following the first dose of OPB-111077. Patients who&#xD;
      withdraw or are withdrawn from the study prior to completing the DLT assessment window for&#xD;
      reasons other than a DLT will not be considered evaluable for DLT and will be replaced.&#xD;
