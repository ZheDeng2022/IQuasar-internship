  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      T-1101 (Tosylate) is a new small molecule chemical entity being developed as a potential&#xD;
      anti-cancer therapeutic by Taivex Therapeutics Corp. T-1101 (Tosylate) is a potent&#xD;
      anti-cancer agent in numerous human cancer cell lines. In addition, oral administration of&#xD;
      T-1101 (Tosylate) showed tumor growth inhibition in different mouse xenograft models of human&#xD;
      cancers. In this study, safety, tolerability and PK of T-1101 (Tosylate) will be evaluated&#xD;
      and also the recommended dose and regimen(s) to initiate Phase 2 will be determined.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <overall_status>Terminated</overall_status>
  <why_stopped>
    The study was terminated before the primary endpoint (determination of MTD) was reached because&#xD;
    the OPC form is to be replaced with the newly developed capsule form in all subsequent clinical&#xD;
    trials.&#xD;

    <measure>Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) of T-1101 (Tosylate) in Participants with Advanced Cancers Refractory to Standard Therapy</measure>
    <time_frame>The first 21-day cycle</time_frame>
    <description>MTD is highest dose level in which 6 patients have been treated with at most 1 experiencing dose limiting toxicity (DLT).&#xD;
When following toxicity events occur within the first 21-day cycle, these toxicity will be defined as DLT.&#xD;
Hematological toxicities : prolonged grade 4 neutropenia for &gt;7 days, grade 3 febrile neutropenia (an ANC &lt; 1000/mm3 with a single temperature of &gt; 38.3°C or a sustained temperature of &gt; 38°C for more than 1 hour), grade 4 febrile neutropenia (febrile neutropenia with life-threatening consequences; urgent intervention indicated), grade 3 neutropenia with grade 3 infection and grade 3 thrombocytopenia with bleeding or grade 4 lasting 7 days.&#xD;
Non-hematological toxicities: grade 3 or 4 toxicities, Nausea and vomiting or diarrhea must persist at grade 3 or 4 despite maximal medical therapy.&#xD;
The above toxicities will be graded according to the NCI CTCAE v4.03.</description>

&#xD;
         10. Pregnancy or breastfeeding. Female patients must be surgically sterile or be&#xD;
             postmenopausal, or must agree to the use of highly effective contraception during the&#xD;
             period of therapy. Highly effective method of birth control is defined as one that&#xD;
             results in a low failure rate (i.e. less than 1 percent per year) when used&#xD;

             contraceptives, intra-uterine devices (IUDs), sexual abstinence, or a vasectomized&#xD;
             partner. All female patients with reproductive potential must have a negative&#xD;
             pregnancy test (serum or urine) prior to enrollment. Male patients must be surgically&#xD;
             sterile or must agree to use effective contraception during the period of therapy. The&#xD;
             definition of effective contraception will be based on the judgment of the principal&#xD;
             investigator or a designated associate.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Other severe acute or chronic medical or psychiatric condition or laboratory&#xD;
             abnormality that would impart, in the judgment of the investigator and/or sponsor,&#xD;
             excess risk associated with study participation or study drug administration, which&#xD;
             would make the patient inappropriate for entry into this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Patients with active infection should be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. Positive test for hepatitis B (HBsAg) or hepatitis C (anti-HCV antibody).&#xD;
