  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test the safety and determine the best dose of venetoclax and&#xD;
      cytarabine when given with or without idarubicin in treating pediatric patients with acute&#xD;
      myeloid leukemia (AML) that did not respond to treatment (refractory) or has come back after&#xD;
      treatment (relapsed).&#xD;
&#xD;
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE: Determine a tolerable combination of venetoclax plus chemotherapy in&#xD;
      pediatric patients with relapsed or refractory AML or acute leukemia of ambiguous lineage.&#xD;
      The primary endpoints are the recommended phase 2 doses (RP2D) of venetoclax plus cytarabine&#xD;
      and venetoclax plus cytarabine and idarubicin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVE: Estimate the overall response rate to the combination of venetoclax and&#xD;
      chemotherapy in pediatric patients with relapsed or refractor AML or acute leukemia of&#xD;
      ambiguous lineage. The secondary endpoints are the rates of complete remission (CR) and&#xD;
      complete remission with incomplete count recovery (CRi) for patients treated at the RP2D.&#xD;

      This study will be done in two parts:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Part 1 - Dose Escalation: The goal of Part 1 of the study is to find the highest&#xD;
           tolerable combination and recommended phase 2 doses (RP2D) of venetoclax plus cytarabine&#xD;
           and venetoclax plus cytarabine and idarubicin that can be given to patients with&#xD;
           leukemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Part 2 - Dose Expansion: After determination of doses in Part 1, patients will be&#xD;
           enrolled on Part 2 to look at the effects of venetoclax plus cytarabine and venetoclax&#xD;
           plus cytarabine and idarubicin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Depending on when participants enroll on the study, Part 1 participants will receive one of&#xD;
      the following courses of therapy:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Venetoclax daily on days 1-28; cytarabine every 12 hours on days 8-17; OR&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Venetoclax daily on days 1-28; cytarabine every 12 hours on days 8-11; OR&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Venetoclax daily on days 1-28; cytarabine every 12 hours on days 8-11; idarubicin once&#xD;
           on day 8; OR&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Venetoclax daily on days 1-28; cytarabine every 12 hours on days 8-17; idarubicin once&#xD;
           on day 8.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 2 participants will receive one of the following courses of therapy:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Venetoclax daily on days 1-28; cytarabine - to be determined from Part 1 of the study;&#xD;
           OR&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Venetoclax daily on days 1-28; cytarabine - to be determined from Part 1 of the study;&#xD;
           idarubicin once on day 8.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The cytarabine dosage will be that found in Part 1 to be the highest safest dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Those participants receiving idarubicin will also receive dexrazoxane.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Note: Part 1 has been completed. Part 2 participants receive the following determined from&#xD;
      Part 1 of the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Venetoclax daily on days 1-28; cytarabine every 12 hours days 8-11 OR&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Venetoclax daily on days 1-28; cytarabine every 12 hours days 8-11; idarubicin once on&#xD;
           day 8.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants on both Part 1 and Part 2 receive one intrathecal (IT) chemotherapy before&#xD;
      starting the first cycle. Patients with CNS disease will receive weekly IT therapy until the&#xD;
      cerebrospinal fluid becomes free of leukemia (minimum of 4 doses). Bone marrow aspiration and&#xD;
      biopsy to assess response will be performed between days 28 and 42 of cycle 1. Patients who&#xD;
      achieve complete remission/complete remission with incomplete count recovery/partial&#xD;
      remission (CR/CRi/PR) and who do not experience unacceptable toxicity during cycle 1 may&#xD;
      receive up to four cycles of chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cohort C (Amendment 5.0): Treatment of participants enrolled in cohort C will include:&#xD;
      Venetoclax daily on days 1-21; cytarabine every 12 hours days 8-11; azacytidine days 1-7.&#xD;
      Participants will receive one intrathecal (IT) chemotherapy before starting the first cycle.&#xD;
      Participants with CNS disease will receive weekly ITMHA until the cerebrospinal fluid becomes&#xD;
      free of leukemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The rolling-6 design will be used to determine the safety of cohort C. After cohort C is&#xD;
      deemed to be safe, additional patients will be enrolled, if necessary, so that at least 6&#xD;
      patients are treated in cohort C to confirm tolerability. After tolerability is confirmed, 6&#xD;
      additional patients will be treated to explore activity.&#xD;

    <description>In Part 1, venetoclax with cytarabine will initially be given at dose level 1 and escalated based on tolerability. Idarubicin will be given only at dose level 4.&#xD;
Note: Part 1 has been completed.&#xD;
Two expansion cohorts will be enrolled:&#xD;
Cohort A will be a group of 12 participants receiving the recommended phase 2 doses (RP2D) of venetoclax plus cytarabine.&#xD;
