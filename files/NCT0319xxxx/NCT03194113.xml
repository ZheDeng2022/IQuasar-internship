      The aim of this project is to investigate the effectiveness of phase-based trauma-focused&#xD;
      therapy (PBT) and intensive trauma-focused therapy (I-TFT) for adult patients with PTSD&#xD;
      related to childhood abuse.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will carry out a RCT, randomizing 150 patients to receive either standard TFT, PBT or&#xD;
      i-TFT. The effects will be assessed at two endpoints of treatment (4, 8 and 16 weeks) and&#xD;
      after a 6 and 12 months follow-up in an intention-to-treat analysis.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The Dutch treatment guidelines recommend trauma-focused treatment (TFT) for PTSD. In TFT,&#xD;
      patients are exposed to trauma reminders that they typically avoid, until their emotional&#xD;
      reactions decline. This treatment has been found very effective for some patients but there&#xD;
      is much room for improvement, particularly in PTSD related to childhood abuse (CA-PTSD).&#xD;
      Symptom exacerbation, non-attendance and dropout rates of up to 40% have been observed in&#xD;
      patients with CA-PTSD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two alternative treatments have been proposed. Firstly, TFT may be preceded by emotion&#xD;
      regulation and interpersonal skills training. This is called phase-based treatment (PBT). The&#xD;
      rationale is that patients with CA-PTSD have affect regulation and interpersonal problems&#xD;
      that interfere with effective delivery of TFT. These problems are rooted in the detrimental&#xD;
      developmental effects of abuse (often by an attachment figure). PBT indeed resulted in more&#xD;
      favorable outcomes and fewer dropouts. In international guidelines, PBT was recently&#xD;
      recommended as treatment of choice for patients with CA-PTSD and comorbidity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Another innovative treatment is intensive TFT (i-TFT), which means delivering TFT in 4&#xD;
      instead of 16 weeks. The condensed format enhances learning and prevents the buildup of&#xD;
      anticipatory anxiety, which in turn affects the patients' motivation. Patients with CA-PTSD&#xD;
      are also characterized by high psychosocial stressors, leading to problems with treatment&#xD;
      attendance and compliance. The condensed format may improve motivation, attendance and&#xD;
      compliance. I-TFT was recently tested in a case series in patients with CA-PTSD and in a&#xD;
      randomized controlled trial (RCT) with patients with adulthood-related PTSD. Both studies had&#xD;
      very low dropout rates (0-3%) and fast recovery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the current study is to investigate the (cost)effectiveness of two innovative&#xD;
      forms of trauma-focused therapy for patients with CA-PTSD: phase-based therapy (emotion&#xD;
      regulation skills training followed bij PE) and intensive PE (i-PE). The effects will be&#xD;
      assessed post-treatment and after a 6 and 12 months follow-up in an intention-to-treat&#xD;
      analysis. Results will be disseminated and included in treatment guidelines. The ultimate&#xD;
      goal is to improve quality of care and contribute to treatment innovation for this severely&#xD;
      ill target population.&#xD;
