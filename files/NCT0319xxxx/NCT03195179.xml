  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pelvic fracture urethral injuries (PFUI) occur in up to 10% of pelvic fractures. It remains&#xD;
      controversial whether initial urethral realignment after PFUI decreases rates of urethral&#xD;
      obstruction and the need for subsequent urethral procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The retrospective record review should determine the utility of acute urethral realignment&#xD;
      after PFUI.&#xD;

      A retrospective chart review to compare outcomes between urethral realignment (group 1) and&#xD;
      suprapubic tube (SPT) placement (group 2). The comparison will be between two routinely&#xD;
      practiced management approaches of urethral injury after pelvic fracture.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior studies demonstrate urethral realignment is associated with a 15% to 50% reduction in&#xD;
      urethral obstruction, however, it has also been associated with higher rates of incontinence&#xD;
      and erectile dysfunction. Our hypothesis is that early realignment of traumatic urethral&#xD;
      injuries after pelvic fracture lowers the incidence of complications like urethral strictures&#xD;
      and subsequent need for surgeries.&#xD;
