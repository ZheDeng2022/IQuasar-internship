  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this study is to investigate whether audiovisual distraction can lead&#xD;
      to a reduction in standard of care administered intraoperative propofol consumption compared&#xD;
      to those who receive propofol sedation alone in adults having total hip or knee replacement&#xD;
      surgery under spinal anesthesia.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The perioperative period is often anxiety-provoking experience for many of our patients. Pain&#xD;
      and awareness are the two primary concerns voiced most frequently. For total knee and hip&#xD;
      replacement surgery, we offer our patients a spinal anesthetic which produces complete&#xD;
      sensory blockade below the level of the waist. Despite a completely insensate knee or hip,&#xD;
      patients still desire sedation during the surgery in order to remain unaware of their&#xD;
      surgical surroundings. Propofol is commonly used in these monitored anesthesia care&#xD;
      procedures because of its favorable drug profile. However, we have observed that anesthesia&#xD;
      providers often use high infusion rates of propofol in order to achieve 'adequate patient&#xD;
      comfort'. In this scenario, providers are often left with the dilemma of providing deeper&#xD;
      levels of sedation for a pleasant patient experience and dealing with the potential&#xD;
      cardiorespiratory complications that follow from oversedation. Unwanted side-effects include&#xD;
      respiratory depression, airway obstruction and hypotension. Clinicians have began looking for&#xD;
      other non-pharmacological ways to provide safe anxiolysis in the operating room while&#xD;
      avoiding these undesirable side-effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Previous studies have shown that audiovisual distraction (AVD) can reduce stress and anxiety&#xD;
      during the perioperative period. In 1997, Ganapathy et al. examined the use of sedative&#xD;
      medications in elderly patients undergoing orthopedic procedures under spinal anesthesia.&#xD;
      They compared patient-controlled propofol administration and anesthesiologist-controlled&#xD;
      midazolam and fentanyl administration.This study found that there were no differences in&#xD;
      patient satisfaction between the two groups. The secondary outcomes did show that propofol&#xD;
      consumption was associated with significantly more episodes of brief respiratory rate&#xD;
      depression but did not increase the need for emergency airway interventions.1&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ayoub et al studied propofol consumption in patients undergoing orthopedic procedures under&#xD;
      spinal anesthesia using auditory distraction. This study demonstrated that auditory&#xD;
      distraction decreased the amount of propofol consumed in patients using auditory distraction&#xD;
      compared to those who had propofol sedation alone.2&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lee et al. began to shift the paradigm of medication induced anxiolysis and pain control&#xD;
      during painful procedures through a series of studies examining different forms of&#xD;
      distraction. An initial study conducted by this group confirmed that audio distraction during&#xD;
      stimulating procedures (colonscopies) reduced the amount of propofol required. In 2003, they&#xD;
      combined audio and visual distraction in patients undergoing and compared the dosages of&#xD;
      propofol required to patients having only visual distraction or no distraction. This study&#xD;
      found that patients with both audio and visual distraction required significantly less&#xD;
      propofol than patients receiving visual distraction or patient-controlled sedation alone.&#xD;
      Other key findings in the AVD group included reduced procedure time, a greater willingness by&#xD;
      the patient to repeat the procedure under the same circumstances, and a statistically&#xD;
      significant higher satisfaction score with the process.3&#xD;
&#xD;
      None of these studies has attempted to evaluate a possible reduction in propofol consumption&#xD;
      for patients having a spinal anesthetic with both audio and visual distraction. We believe&#xD;
      the next step to improving the perioperative experience for our patients is to incorporate&#xD;
      AVD for patients having total knee and hip replacement surgery under a spinal anesthetic. Our&#xD;
      hypothesis is that AVD will significantly reduce standard of care administered propofol&#xD;
      consumption while still providing a pleasant experience for our patients and reducing&#xD;
      unwanted side-effects associated with higher levels of propofol sedation.&#xD;
