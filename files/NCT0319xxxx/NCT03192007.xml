      The goals of this study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To optimize and evaluate multiple kidney MRI methods; and&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To investigate the potential of MRI in the assessment of transplant kidney functions; To&#xD;
           achieve these goals, we will perform pilot MRI studies with kidney transplant patients.&#xD;
           We will study if MRI can reflect different levels of kidney function. The investigators&#xD;
           will also evaluate if MRI can differentiate causes for declining kidney function.&#xD;
           Finally, the investigators will explore how MRI measures changes before and after&#xD;
           medical treatment for worsening kidney function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You may be invited for MRI exams with different exam options. An MRI exam may use either of&#xD;
      two types of MRI machines at the CMRR: the 3T scanner and the 7T scanner. You may also be&#xD;
      invited for a multi-session exam. A description of the MRI exam types with different exam&#xD;
      options and the types of multi-session exams is provided later in this document.&#xD;

        The proposed studies are pilot studies to obtain preliminary data for the development of&#xD;
        hypotheses and estimate the power for future large-scale studies. To accomplish the&#xD;
        objectives of the proposed pilot studies, we will enroll a total of 140 renal transplant&#xD;
        patients. Based on our previous experience, there will be about 20% patients who may&#xD;
        withdraw after informed consent. Equal number of male and female subjects will be recruited&#xD;
        for each patient group. In addition, the age of patients will be matched or ensured&#xD;
        insignificant across the groups of the study objectives.&#xD;
