  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This trial is conducted in Africa, Asia, Europe and North America. The aim of the trial is to&#xD;
      assess the efficacy of concizumab administered s.c. (subcutaneously, under the skin) once&#xD;
      daily in preventing bleeding episodes in haemophilia A and B patients with inhibitors.&#xD;

    <participant_flow>
      <recruitment_details>The trial was conducted at 17 sites in 12 countries as follows: Austria (1), Croatia (1), Denmark (1), Italy (2), Spain (2), Sweden (1), the United Kingdom (1), Israel (1), Malaysia (2), Ukraine (1), Japan (2) and the United States (2). In addition to these sites, 4 sites were approved by the IRB/IEC and/or local health authority but did not screen or assign any participants to treatment.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>The trial consisted of two treatment periods: main part which lasted 24 weeks for participants randomised to eptacog alfa and at least 24 weeks for participants randomised to concizumab, and an extension part which lasted up to 94 weeks.</pre_assignment_details>

          <title>Concizumab- Main Part</title>
          <description>Participants were to receive subcutaneous (s.c.) injection of concizumab once daily for 24 weeks. The initial dose was 0.15 milligrams per kilogram (mg/kg) and then the dose was escalated to 0.20 and 0.25 mg/kg based on the number of spontaneous bleeding episodes. A loading dose of 0.5 mg/kg was given as the first concizumab dose. A single injection of 90 micrograms per kilogram (Î¼g/kg) eptacog alfa (rFVIIa) was administered in a non-bleeding state one week after the dosing with concizumab had initiated.</description>

          <description>Participants who completed main part treatment were to receive s.c. injection of concizumab once daily for 52-94 weeks. Participants who received concizumab during the main part were to continue with their treatment at last dose by the end of main part and those received eptacog alfa during the main part were to start their treatment with 0.15 mg/kg of concizumab. The dose was then escalated to 0.20 and 0.25 mg/kg based on the number of spontaneous bleeding episodes. A loading dose of 0.5 mg/kg was given as the first concizumab dose.

        <title>Number of Treatment-emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs) During at Least 76 Weeks From Treatment Onset</title>
        <description>An adverse event (AE) was any untoward medical occurrence in a participant administered a medicinal product, and which does not necessarily had a causal relationship with this treatment. A TEAE was defined as an event that had onset from the first exposure to treatment until the last visit in the trial. Number of TEAEs that occurred during at least 76 weeks from treatment onset (week 0) are presented. The data is presented per the dose level which the participants have reached at the time of event.</description>

Participants who completed the main part (24 weeks) of the study continued their treatment in the extension part for 52-94 weeks. Participants who received concizumab during the main part were to continue with their treatment at last dose by the end of main part and those received eptacog alfa during the main part were to start their treatment with concizumab. A loading dose of 0.5 mg/kg was given as the first concizumab dose. A single injection of 90 Î¼g/kg eptacog alfa (rFVIIa) was administered in a non-bleeding state one week after dosing with concizumab had initiated.</description>
