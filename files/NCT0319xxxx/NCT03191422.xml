    <textblock>
      This study aims to explore if the LSVT BIG® - a motor learning based treatment program&#xD;
      designed for rehabilitation of people with Parkinson's disease could be beneficial for&#xD;
      chronic stroke rehabilitation. A single-case experimental design with two adult participants,&#xD;
      will be monitored for performance on self-selected goals before, during and after&#xD;
      participating in the treatment program.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Over 700 000 Canadians are living with the effects of stroke. Approximately 60% of people&#xD;
      living with the effects of stroke need help with every day activities and 84% are limited in&#xD;
      the activities which they would like to participate in. Much research has focused on&#xD;
      interventions for acute and sub-acute rehabilitation but it is also known that gains can&#xD;
      still be made in the chronic stage. Among common rehabilitation interventions to reduce&#xD;
      impairment, there is moderate evidence of effectiveness of constraint induced movement&#xD;
      therapy (CIMT) and mirror therapy and weak evidence of effectiveness of repetitive task&#xD;
      training. However, positive effects on impairment do not necessarily carryover into&#xD;
      activities of daily living.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, an intervention program with a goal of improvement in occupational performance&#xD;
      outside of the clinical setting, one that targets everyday activities and participant&#xD;
      selected activities, would be a valuable tool for occupational therapy post stroke. The&#xD;
      objective of this study was to explore whether the LSVT BIG® program, an intervention&#xD;
      targeting participant-identified functional goals which includes strategies to encourage&#xD;
      generalization to other tasks, could be applicable to the rehabilitation of the chronic&#xD;
      effects of stroke.&#xD;
&#xD;
      LSVT BIG is a time limited, high intensity rehabilitation program designed to be used by&#xD;
      occupational therapists or physiotherapists to target Parkinson's disease motor symptoms of&#xD;
      bradykinesia and hypokinesia, in an outpatient environment, with a goal of improving&#xD;
      function. This intervention involves exercises and repetitive practice of patient-selected&#xD;
      activities with a focus on big (increased amplitude) movements. It is believed that this will&#xD;
      lead to normally paced and sized movements which will generalize to untrained activities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although Parkinson's disease and stroke have different pathological mechanisms, the elements&#xD;
      in the LSVT BIG program are based on the same neuroplasticity and motor learning principles&#xD;
      that form the basis for stroke rehabilitation methods. What is novel, however, is the focus&#xD;
      on amplitude and just one cue, 'big', for all difficult movement situations, potentially&#xD;
      increasing generalizability outside of the clinical setting and trained activities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The LSVT BIG program uses motor learning principles of blocked practice, serial practice and&#xD;
      elements of random practice (varying environmental factors), extrinsic feedback (including&#xD;
      verbal feedback, modeling, shaping and focus on knowledge of results) as well as a single&#xD;
      external, knowledge of results focused cue 'big' to encourage adaptation, recalibration of&#xD;
      the internal motor program of the movement, and transfer to other tasks. LSVT BIG also&#xD;
      respects the neuroplasticity principles of intensity, repetition, specificity and saliency&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to begin to explore the effectiveness of LSVT BIG in late stroke&#xD;
      rehabilitation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary hypothesis is that participants with chronic stroke will demonstrate improvement&#xD;
      in trained activities following LSVT BIG.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A secondary hypothesis is that participants will also improve in untrained activities due to&#xD;
      carryover of the intervention effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design A single-case experimental design (SCED) with one replication was used . An&#xD;
      A-B-A design was selected and included a baseline phase, an intervention phase, and a&#xD;
      post-intervention phase. Perceived performance and satisfaction with performance of&#xD;
      participant-selected activities, and self-report of everyday upper extremity use were the&#xD;
      outcomes subjected to repeated measures. In addition, pre- and post- measures of observed&#xD;
      performance quality and upper extremity function were carried out.&#xD;
