      Computer-assisted rehabilitation of attention deficits in pediatric Multiple Sclerosis and&#xD;
      ADHD patients recruited during the study &quot;Cognitive impairment in Pediatric Onset Multiple&#xD;
      Sclerosis: research of biomarkers predictive of cognitive impairment progression&quot;.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The presence of cognitive deficits of varied intensity is characteristic of psychiatric&#xD;
      disorders of childhood and adolescence such as Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder&#xD;
      (ADHD), but also of neurological pathologies such as pediatric onset multiple sclerosis&#xD;
      (POMS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      ADHD is one of the most common neurodevelopmental disorders characterized by pervasive&#xD;
      patterns of inattention and/or impulsivity/hyperactivity and a range of cognitive&#xD;
      dysfunctions that often persist into adulthood.&#xD;
&#xD;
      POMS represent 5-10% of total MS population. Cognitive dysfunction is one of the most&#xD;
      remarkable features of MS, and, particularly in POMS, the percentage of patients with at&#xD;
      least a mild cognitive deficit ranges from 30 to 80%. The most affected cognitive domains in&#xD;
      POMS are complex attention, information processing speed, executive functions, verbal and&#xD;
      visual memory, reasoning and problem solving.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The functional consequences of cognitive impairment can be particularly striking in children&#xD;
      and adolescents since they occur during formative years in the academic career and may affect&#xD;
      their social activities. Cognitive training, during the developmental age, when brain&#xD;
      plasticity is at the highest expression, can induce a strengthening of the key brain networks&#xD;
      implicated in POMS and ADHD. To date the efficacy of specific cognitive rehabilitation&#xD;
      interventions has never been evaluated by a randomized controlled trials (RCTS) in POMS.&#xD;
      Conversely, in the last years, several RCTs assessed the efficacy of cognitive training as a&#xD;
      potential non-drug alternative treatment for ADHD disorder.Most of the cognitive trainings&#xD;
      focused on the working memory or attention dysfunctions. Preliminary evidence suggests that&#xD;
      cognitive remediation might be at least partially effective in the ADHD treatment. It is&#xD;
      argued that cognitive training can reduce ADHD symptoms and improve functioning by targeting&#xD;
      neuropsychological deficits thought to mediate ADHD pathophysiology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the study project &quot;Cognitive impairment in Pediatric Onset Multiple Sclerosis:&#xD;
      research of biomarkers predictive of cognitive impairment progression&quot;, which is aimed to&#xD;
      assess clinical, radiological and biological markers in pediatric subjects, POMS and ADHD&#xD;
      patients will be recruited to assess the efficacy of a home-based computerized program for&#xD;
      retraining attention dysfunction.&#xD;
