      Multicentre, open label, uncontrolled, phase I pharmacokinetic study, to determine the&#xD;
      Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) of APO010 administered intravenously on D1, D8 and D15 followed&#xD;
      by a one-week drug rest, in patients with multiple myeloma for who have relapsed or are&#xD;
      refractory to 2 (in high-risk patients 1) or more different prior therapies and who have Drug&#xD;
      Response Predictor (DRP) for APO010 indicating a higher likelihood for response to APO010.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      APO010 is a novel investigational antitumour agent. It is a recombinant form of human Fas&#xD;
      ligand (FasL), a protein with the function of inducing programmed cell death (apoptosis).&#xD;
      Preclinical studies indicate that multiple myeloma is sensitive for APO010. Estimation of DRP&#xD;
      for APO010 in myeloma patients suggests that it may be possible to identify patients with&#xD;
      high and low likelihood for response, and thereby allocate the predicted high likelihood&#xD;
      patients to the treatment. Preclinical results indicate that, in comparison with other single&#xD;
      agents, APO010 exercises superior anti-tumour effect by inducing apoptosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will include patients with multiple myeloma who have relapsed or are refractory to&#xD;
      2 (in high-risk patients 1) or more different prior therapies, including IMiDs and PI and who&#xD;
      have Drug Response Predictor (DRP) for APO010 indicating a higher likelihood for response to&#xD;
      APO010.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is a multicentre, open label, uncontrolled, phase I, dose escalation,&#xD;
      pharmacokinetic study, to determine the Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) of APO010 administered&#xD;
      intravenously on D1, D8 and D15 followed by a one-week drug rest i.e. cycle duration is 4&#xD;
      weeks. The study will contain an extension phase where the Recommended Dose will be tested on&#xD;
      additional patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary endpoint is determination of the Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD)based upon first&#xD;
      cycle drug-related dose-limiting toxicity and the recommended dose of APO010. Safety will be&#xD;
      evaluated during the study and for 30 days after the last administration of study drug.&#xD;
      Adverse events and laboratory studies will be graded according to NCI-CTCAE v. 4.03.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proportion of patients with positive HADA assessment will be investigated and a&#xD;
      description of any objective tumour response based on International Myeloma Working Group&#xD;
      criteria and from changes in M-protein and iFLC.&#xD;
