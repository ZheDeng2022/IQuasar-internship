  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will examine whether or not the use of digital communication methods (text&#xD;
      messages and emails) improves patient engagement with Early Intervention Psychosis (EIP)&#xD;
      Services, compared to standard communication methods (letters and telephone calls).&#xD;
&#xD;
      One of the biggest challenges of psychiatric services is patient disengagement. People with&#xD;
      psychosis, are often difficult to engage in community based mental health services (CMHTs).&#xD;
      Patient's who disengage from psychiatric care often have higher social care needs, are often&#xD;
      more unwell and are more likely to be detained under the Mental Health Act compared to those&#xD;
      who engage. It is important to examine the reasons for this for both research and clinical&#xD;
      reasons to establish the effectiveness of the service to its users. Importance must be placed&#xD;
      on the clinician's perspective of the engagement; the patient's perspective is vital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is a pilot two-arm pragmatic Randomised Control Trial to examine the feasibility&#xD;
      of assessing engagement of EIP services through different communication methods. Patients and&#xD;
      care-coordinators will use self-reported scales to measure engagement to determine whether&#xD;
      this improves through the use of different communication methods.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be asked to consent to being randomly allocated to one of two groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
      (i.) Receive letters, phone calls and voicemail's from their care coordinator for standard&#xD;
      appointments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OR&#xD;
&#xD;
      (ii.) Receive text messages and emails from their care-coordinator for standard appointments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients eligible for this study will be in their first six months of care under an EIP CMHT&#xD;
      and who have consented to take part. They will be aged 18-35, not a hospital inpatient, have&#xD;
      access to the Internet, a mobile phone and who are fluent in the English language.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Care-coordinators will assess the feasibility and acceptability of the design and procedures&#xD;
      and determine an effective sample size calculation for a future large scale pragmatic&#xD;
      Randomised Controlled Trial.&#xD;

      Participants (patients and care-coordinators):&#xD;
&#xD;
      Instruments:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients:&#xD;
&#xD;
      SOLES (Singh O'Brien Level of Engagement Scale, O'Brien et al 2009). (Appendix 1) This&#xD;
      self-reporting scale is designed to measure the level of engagement in people with psychosis.&#xD;
      It contains 16 questions covering various aspects of engagement, each question scored in a&#xD;
      scale ranging from 0-10. This scale takes about 8-10 minutes to be completed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Care Coordinators:&#xD;
&#xD;
      SES (Service Engagement Scale, Tait et al 2002). (Appendix 2) The SES is a scale completed by&#xD;
      clinicians to assess their perceived level of engagement of patients under their care. It is&#xD;
      a 14-question scale covering the same areas as the SOLES. The scale taken about 4-6 minutes&#xD;
      to be completed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Care Coordinator Feasibility Questionnaire:&#xD;
&#xD;
      It would also be of interest to collect feedback from care coordinators about the ease of use&#xD;
      of the procedure along with the relevance and acceptability. This will be done through the&#xD;
      use of a self reporting scale of how feasible the intervention delivery was. (Appendix 3)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interventions:&#xD;
&#xD;
      When arranging appointments or having any other communication outside face-to-face meetings,&#xD;
      care coordinators participating in this study will be expected to contact their patients in&#xD;
      two distinct ways:&#xD;
&#xD;
      (i) 20 patients will receive Standard contact: this will happen by means of letters,&#xD;
      telephone call and voicemail's only. Care co-ordinators already have trust mobile phones that&#xD;
      they can use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      (ii) 20 patients will receive Digital media contact: only text messages and e-mails will be&#xD;
      used to contact patients. Care coordinators will also be provided with i-pads (funded by the&#xD;
      British Research Council so that they can do this when also outside of clinic).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both types of contact will be made explicit for care coordinators at the beginning of the&#xD;
      study, with frequent reminders occurring during the period of data collection. Care&#xD;
      coordinators will have immediate access to written information about each of the&#xD;
      interventions through participant information and consent forms provided (appendix 5).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A two-arm pragmatic pilot Randomised Controlled Trial. will be conducted comparing the&#xD;
      digital media contact methods with standard contact methods and will assess the potential for&#xD;
      progressing into a full pragmatic Randomised Controlled Trial. The co-primary outcome&#xD;
      measures are to determine whether engagement with care coordinator/services improves through&#xD;
      the use of digital media communication compared to standard methods of communication using&#xD;
      The Singh O'Brien Level of Engagement Scales (SOLES)(O'Brien et al 2009) (SOLES) and The&#xD;
      Service Engagement Scale (SES) (Tait et al 2002). These are self rating scales which will be&#xD;
      completed both pre and post intervention to examine whether or not there has been an increase&#xD;
      in engagement. Success of the study will be measured by an increase of scores in the scales&#xD;
      to determine whether or not increased engagement was achieved.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Consecutive patients accepted for care under EIP teams will be asked to consent to&#xD;
      participate in this study. If they consent, they will be allocated to one of two groups:&#xD;
      either the Standard group or the Digital Media group. It is expected that each group will&#xD;
      have approximately 20 patients. Care coordinator's will also be asked to consent to&#xD;
      participate in the study and will be briefed by chief investigator on procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two months after intake into the study, patients and care coordinators will complete their&#xD;
      respective engagement questionnaires. The level of engagement of each group, as measured by&#xD;
      the instruments, will be used to analyse and compare the impact of the interventions.&#xD;
