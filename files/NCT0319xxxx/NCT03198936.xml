    <textblock>
      Brain Pill™ is a mental health enhancing and successfully marketed dietary supplement with a&#xD;
      balanced composition of scientifically proven nutrients for accelerating and restoring brain&#xD;
      function and thereby enhancing the cognitive performance and creating positive impact on&#xD;
      behavioral outcomes.Hence the aim of the study is assessment of the effects of Brain Pill&#xD;
      supplementation on memory performance in healthy adults with subjective memory complaints.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled , single centered study to access the&#xD;
      efficacy of Brain Pill on working memory capacity and mild mood disturbances.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Effect of Brain Pill on working memory capacity will be accessed by improvement in mean&#xD;
      response time and accuracy measured by working memory battery from baseline to end of the&#xD;
      study. Effect of Brain Pill is also accessed on Neurophysiological improvement in working&#xD;
      memory as measured by electroencephelogram (EEG) from baseline to end of the study. Also&#xD;
      improvement in attention and concentration will be accessed from baseline to end of the study&#xD;
      by Picture recognition test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Effect of Brain Pill on mood disturbances will be accessed by Brunel Universal Mood State.&#xD;
