    <textblock>
      This is a multi-centre phase I/II trial with an initial dose finding phase for&#xD;
      cyclophosphamide and lenalidomide combined with fixed dose pembrolizumab for patients with&#xD;
      relapsed or relapsed / refractory MM that have had at least one prior line of therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As this combination has not been given before, participants will be registered initially into&#xD;
      a dose finding phase where dose limiting toxicities (DLTs) will be monitored during the first&#xD;
      cycle in order to confirm the recommended dose schedule (RD) of cyclophosphamide with&#xD;
      lenalidomide and fixed dose pembrolizumab. A modified toxicity probability interval (mTPI)&#xD;
      approach has been taken for dose finding, to determine a safe dose schedule defined as the&#xD;
      probability of dose limiting toxicity below an acceptable rate of 34%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once a RD is identified an expansion phase is planned to estimate the activity profile of the&#xD;
      Key-CR combination at the RD. The trial will start at the highest dose schedule . Cohorts of&#xD;
      3 evaluable participants will sequentially be recruited to the trial until the RD has been&#xD;
      identified or the trial stopped due to excessive toxicity at dose schedule -1. The dose&#xD;
      schedule to be given to a subsequent cohort will be evaluated after all participants have&#xD;
      been followed up for one cycle or experienced a DLT. The Safety Review Committee (SRC) will&#xD;
      be presented with a complete safety report in addition to a set of predetermined dosing&#xD;
      decisions, such that all relevant information available may be considered before deciding&#xD;
      upon the next dose schedule to be allocated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The mTPI is an adaptive Bayesian design specifying that the parameter for the probability&#xD;
      that a patient experiences a DLT during the first cycle follows a separate distribution for&#xD;
      each dose level. Each DLT probability is believed to be equally likely to take any value&#xD;
      between 0 and 1 before any data is collected this represents a non-informative or flat prior.&#xD;
      The posterior distribution from which escalation decisions are made is constructed by&#xD;
      updating the prior distribution with observed data and represents our updated beliefs about&#xD;
      the parameter after having seen the data. The decision to remain at the current dose schedule&#xD;
      (S), escalate (E), or de-escalate (D) from the posterior distribution is determined by&#xD;
      probability theory and two clinical criteria; the minimum DLT rate that if true would warrant&#xD;
      escalation and the maximum DLT rate that if true would warrant dose de-escalation. The&#xD;
      clinical interval is specified to be (0.2, 0.34) in this setting. Below 0.2 would represent&#xD;
      under-dosing and warrant escalation, above 0.34, over-dosing and de-escalation and in the&#xD;
      interval proper dosing and the decision to remain at the current dose level.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be registered to a dose schedule in cohorts of 3 evaluable participants and&#xD;
      a decision regarding expansion or dose (de)escalation will be made once all patients have&#xD;
      been followed up for the full DLT observation period (see below).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A minimum of 6 participants must be evaluated at a dose schedule for the dose schedule to be&#xD;
      considered the RD. If dose schedule -1 or 0 meet the RD criterion but the dose schedule above&#xD;
      has not been excluded, a further cohort of participants may be treated at the dose schedule&#xD;
      above at discretion of the SRC. If dose schedule -1 is found to be unsafe the trial will&#xD;
      terminate early without opening the expansion phase. The SRC may consider increasing the size&#xD;
      of cohorts after 12 evaluable participants have been treated at a dose schedule without&#xD;
      identifying the RD. Once the RD has been identified the trial will move into the expansion&#xD;
      phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is essential that the data for each participant is returned in a timely manner to allow&#xD;
      the participants to be monitored for safety and dose limiting toxicities that could affect&#xD;
      the safety of other participants. Data must be returned on time to allow a timely review of&#xD;
      the trial by the Safety Review Committee to prevent a hold up in progressing the trial to the&#xD;
      next phase or dose level, or to allow it to be stopped quickly in the event of an unforeseen&#xD;
      issue occurring.&#xD;
