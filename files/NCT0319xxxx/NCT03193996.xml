  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study seeks to determine whether the 4DCT imaging technique can be used to replace&#xD;
      current invasive diagnostic tests for ligament injuries of the wrist.&#xD;

      Aim 1:&#xD;
&#xD;
      40 cadaveric forearm/hand specimens will be obtained from the Mayo Clinic Anatomical Bequest&#xD;
      program. 10 will be used to refine the ligament injury model and 30 will be used as follows.&#xD;
      The specimens will undergo radiographic screening and will be excluded from the study if they&#xD;
      have evidence of fracture, bony trauma, significant arthritic changes, or previous surgeries.&#xD;
      The tendons will be loaded. The remaining soft tissues will be dissected from the proximal&#xD;
      ulna and radius. Polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) resin will be used to affix the proximal&#xD;
      radius and ulna in a circular acrylic fixture. The custom wrist motion simulator was designed&#xD;
      to generate muscle-assisted flexion-extension and radial-ulnar deviation movements and is&#xD;
      CT-compatible. Each tendon will be dynamically loaded with a constant 10 N, maintained&#xD;
      throughout the movement in the following conditions: wrist flexion-extension and radial-ulnar&#xD;
      deviation. The hand will be fixed in a grip that is connected to a programmable linear&#xD;
      actuator. The linear actuator drives the grip back-and-forth along the x-axis with&#xD;
      free-motion along the z-axis. The linear actuator will be programmed to allow the wrist to&#xD;
      perform a full radial-ulnar or flexion-extension motion at 30 deg/sec which simulates in vivo&#xD;
      wrist motion speeds. A motion cycle is approximately 2 seconds. The wrist will be cycled 100&#xD;
      times in flexion-extension prior to each testing condition. A static CT image will be&#xD;
      acquired in the neutral posture. Then, each wrist will be imaged using 4DCT during&#xD;
      flexion-extension and radial-ulnar deviation, in the following conditions: intact (control),&#xD;
      volar SLIL cut, membranous SLIL cut, dorsal SLIL cut, radioscaphocapitate ligament cut, and&#xD;
      long radiolunate ligament cut.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2:&#xD;
&#xD;
      4DCT scanning will be performed bilaterally on 60 patients (30 males, 30 females) with&#xD;
      unilateral SLIL injury who are scheduled to undergo a surgical intervention. In addition,&#xD;
      patients will have pre-surgical volar and dorsal arthroscopic confirmation of ligament&#xD;
      injury, categorized by Geissler and European Wrist Arthroscopy Society (EWAS)&#xD;
      classifications; video recording of the arthroscopy will be obtained for later analysis. PRWE&#xD;
      and VAS questionnaires will be completed at the 4DCT visit for the injured wrist and the&#xD;
      Total Patient Rated Wrist Evaluation (PRWE) score (sum of pain and function subscales) and&#xD;
      composite change in Visual Analog Pain Scale (VAS) score used in the analysis. 4DCT wrist&#xD;
      data will be obtained while the subjects perform flexion-extension and radial-ulnar&#xD;
      deviation. The dynamic image sequence will be processed with existing software tools to&#xD;
      obtain metrics describing the interosseous distances between the articular surfaces of the&#xD;
      scaphoid, lunate, and radius, during the movement cycles. Given the difficulty of diagnosing&#xD;
      SLIL injury, the uninjured contralateral wrist is often used as a &quot;control&quot; for comparison by&#xD;
      physicians; therefore, the difference in right/left metrics will be used in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 3:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The same 60 patients ( see Aim 2) will be evaluated. Surgeons will assess pre-surgical&#xD;
      scapholunate interosseus distances (quantified using 4DCT in Aim 2) and document a treatment&#xD;
      plan to address the particular injury. Subsequently, 4DCT-based treatment plans will be&#xD;
      compared with arthroscopic evaluation (obtained in Aim 2); any existing wrist x-rays (e.g.&#xD;
      AP, lateral, stress views) and MRIs may be used in this comparison as well. The surgeon will&#xD;
      then select and perform the targeted surgical intervention based on both 4DCT and&#xD;
      arthroscopic findings. 4DCT will be performed, and the PRWE and VAS completed by patients at&#xD;
      1 year postoperatively; quantification of radioscaphoid contact patterns will be assessed&#xD;
      during bilateral wrist flexion-extension and radial-ulnar deviation to determine if normal&#xD;
      patterns of motion are restored.&#xD;
