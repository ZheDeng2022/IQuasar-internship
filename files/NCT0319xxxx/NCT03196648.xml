  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of a newly formulated&#xD;
      foaming gel product on gingivitis and/or moderate periodontitis when used with or without the&#xD;
      GLO Science accelerating device (GLO Device), compared to standard tooth brushing with&#xD;
      antioxidant whitening toothpaste with or without flossing (split mouth design for control&#xD;
      group).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a 60-day randomized single blinded parallel group study. After 42 days, all use of&#xD;
      interventional products were discontinued, and the participants returned to the clinical&#xD;
      center at day 60 for final measurements. The primary outcomes assessed in this study were the&#xD;
      differences in gingival index (GI) and bleeding on probing (BOP) from baseline to 42 &amp; 60&#xD;
      days. The secondary outcomes are tooth whitening, oral malodor, pocket depth and plaque&#xD;
      amount.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is hypothesized that participants using the gingival health product with the GLO Device&#xD;
      will experience greater reductions in GI &amp; BOP measurements than the control group, as well&#xD;
      as participants using the gingival health product on a toothbrush alone.&#xD;
