  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Essential hypertension (HTN) is a disease that affects approximately 1 billion individuals&#xD;
      worldwide. Despite the availability of effective and safe anti-hypertensive drugs, 65% of&#xD;
      subjects diagnosed with HTN do not have their blood pressure (BP) controlled (&lt;140/90 mmHg).&#xD;
      The overall incidence of resistant HTN, (defined as requiring 3 or more anti-hypertensive&#xD;
      drugs, including a diuretic, to control BP) is estimated to be 15% of the hypertensive&#xD;
      population. Consequently, there is a pressing unmet medical need to develop new classes of&#xD;
      anti-hypertensive drugs that act on alternative pathways and further control BP and the&#xD;
      associated cardiovascular risks in subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The prevalence of HTN in African Americans in the United States is among the highest in the&#xD;
      world, and HTN is more common in African Americans than in Caucasians. One of the risk&#xD;
      factors for HTN is sodium sensitivity. There is a higher association of HTN with sodium&#xD;
      sensitivity in African American subjects and other racial/ethnic groups who are&#xD;
      overweight/obese.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Effective agents to treat HTN in this high-risk population are clearly needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will be conducted in a hypertensive, overweight subject population of multiple&#xD;
      ethnic origins in which QGC001 is likely, based on its mode of action, to demonstrate a&#xD;
      significant anti-hypertensive effect.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      QGC001 is a prodrug of the specific and selective APA inhibitor, EC33, and is the prototype&#xD;
      of a new class of centrally-acting anti-hypertensive agents called brain APA inhibitors.&#xD;
      Inhibition of brain APA, which converts Ang II into Ang III, has emerged as a novel anti&#xD;
      hypertensive treatment, as demonstrated in several experimental animal models. QGC001's&#xD;
      anti-hypertensive effect is in part due to: 1) a decrease in arginine vasopressin release in&#xD;
      the blood circulation, increasing diuresis, which reduces the size of body fluid compartment;&#xD;
      and 2) a reduction in the sympathetic tone, leading to subsequent decreases in vascular&#xD;
      resistances.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is an open-label, dose-titrating safety and efficacy study of QGC001 administered&#xD;
      PO, BID, over 8 weeks in hypertensive overweight subjects of multiple ethnic and racial&#xD;
      groups in the United States.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of this study is to assess the effects of twice daily (BID)&#xD;
      administration of oral (PO) QGC001 (250 mg BID, 500 mg BID, and 500 mg BID +&#xD;
      hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) 25 mg once daily [QD]) on blood pressure (BP) over 8 weeks in&#xD;
      hypertensive overweight/obese subjects of multiple races/ethnicities.&#xD;
