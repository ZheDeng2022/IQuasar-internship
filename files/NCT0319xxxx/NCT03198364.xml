  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Schizophrenia and bipolar disorder are associated with high risk for suicide, yet there are&#xD;
      few brief interventions that directly target suicide prevention in this large population. The&#xD;
      goal of this intervention development study is to evaluate the feasibility, acceptability,&#xD;
      and preliminary effectiveness of a brief intervention called SafeTy and Recovery Therapy&#xD;
      (START) that is augmented with content delivered on mobile devices outside of the clinic&#xD;
      setting. The intervention will evaluated in a community urgent care center context as people&#xD;
      initiate outpatient care, and, if effective, could be deployed in a wide network of such&#xD;
      centers.&#xD;

      This intervention development research project evaluates the feasibility, acceptability, and&#xD;
      preliminary impact of a brief cognitive behavioral intervention, tailored to SMI, that is&#xD;
      delivered during the gap period between urgent care evaluation and follow-up outpatient care.&#xD;
      SafeTy and Recovery Therapy (START) is a 4-session cognitive behavioral intervention&#xD;
      augmented by mobile technology, which delivers automated and personalized reinforcement of&#xD;
      adaptive coping behavior outside of the clinic setting. START builds from collaborative&#xD;
      development alongside a community psychiatric service organization, and our preliminary data&#xD;
      in the SMI population that supports the feasibility, acceptability, and impact of brief,&#xD;
      mobile augmented cognitive behavioral intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a 3-year developmental study, our deployment focused approach will first refine&#xD;
      intervention procedures, safety and care continuity protocols, and fit with the deployment&#xD;
      setting with a series of collaborative contacts with community providers, project staff,&#xD;
      advisors, and patient advocates. We will next conduct a pilot randomized controlled trial&#xD;
      with 70 patients diagnosed with either bipolar disorder or schizophrenia rapidly referred by&#xD;
      community triage providers to receive START in the walk-in clinic setting. Patients are&#xD;
      enrolled who have SMI diagnoses and current active suicidal ideation and/or a suicide attempt&#xD;
      in the prior 3 months. Participants are randomized to one of two active conditions: START +&#xD;
      Mobile augmentation or START alone. We will evaluate feasibility, acceptability, and&#xD;
      enhancement of rates of outpatient treatment engagement and crisis service use in comparison&#xD;
      to the sample population. We will also examine pragmatic mechanisms, which include outpatient&#xD;
      treatment engagement and coping self-efficacy, on change in suicidal ideation severity and&#xD;
      crisis service use along with the preliminary impact of mobile augmentation.&#xD;
