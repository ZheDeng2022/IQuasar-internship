  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if routine consumption of high antioxidant cacao&#xD;
      can have an effect on the behaviors of children with Autism Spectrum Disorder. This is&#xD;
      proposed as children with Autism Spectrum Disorder have elevated oxidative stress markers,&#xD;
      such as, free radicals making them highly vulnerable to oxidative damage. Thus, it is&#xD;
      proposed that foods high in antioxidant activity can offer protection against oxidative&#xD;
      stress and thus impact behaviors.&#xD;

      Subjects will include both males and females with an age range between 5 and 18 years. Study&#xD;
      will include subjects from any race or ethnicity that meet eligibility criteria. Inclusion&#xD;
      criteria: children with a diagnosis of Autism Spectrum Disorder, are between the ages of 5&#xD;
      and 18, and like 70% dark chocolate. Exclusion criteria: Food allergies, Caffeine&#xD;
      hypersensitivity, Theobromine hypersensitivity, History of seizures or epilepsy,&#xD;
      Developmental age &lt; 24 months, and Diabetics. The target study population is school aged&#xD;
      children with a diagnosis of Autism Spectrum Disorder. Participants will be recruited using&#xD;
      snowballing and judgmental sampling via word-of-mouth, flyers, emails, and social media with&#xD;
      a $50.00 gift card offered for participants who complete the study in full and $15.00 gift&#xD;
      card for teachers who complete study in full. Flyers will be distributed throughout the&#xD;
      Southern California area due to proximity, however, participants may come from any region if&#xD;
      satisfying inclusion criteria and time commitment. Flyers will be placed in, but not limited&#xD;
      to, common public places such as local community centers, pediatric therapy clinics,&#xD;
      pediatricians' offices, churches, schools, and more. The principal student researcher or&#xD;
      appropriate PhD committee personnel will acquire email addresses of potential participants.&#xD;
      Specific social media outlets will include postings on, but not limited to, Facebook,&#xD;
      Instagram, and Twitter. The name of the principal investigator and contact information of the&#xD;
      student researcher will be available on the flyer with an invitation to contact researchers&#xD;
      with any questions about the study. Families of those children with a diagnosis of Autism&#xD;
      Spectrum Disorder will be offered a flyer to determine if they are interested in&#xD;
      participating in the study. The informed consent process will be facilitated by the student&#xD;
      researcher with the parents of the child with a diagnosis of Autism Spectrum Disorder. The&#xD;
      informed consent process will take place at a location of convenience for parents who will be&#xD;
      provided fifteen minutes for decision making and discussion. Due to the subjects' impaired&#xD;
      decision making capacity, the parents will provide consent on their behalf. HIPPA compliance&#xD;
      forms will be included with informed consent process. Privacy of medical and research records&#xD;
      will be secured in a locked cabinet in a locked office.Procedures are listed as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Informed Consent and HIPPA documents.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Subject will also be offered a taste testing of the chocolate bar to be used in the&#xD;
           study as liking the 70% dark chocolate is part of inclusion criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. After consent is provided, parent will fill out the Youth &amp; Adolescent Food Frequency&#xD;
           Questionnaire based on their child's typical dietary habits, an Autism Spectrum Rating&#xD;
           Scale, an Aberrant Behavior Checklist, and the Parental Stress Index Questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Student researcher will prepare doses (4 squares per dose or 8 grams) of the dark&#xD;
           chocolate for each child in one week increments at a time. The dark chocolate will be&#xD;
           wrapped in foil to protect against light and kept in a sealed Ziploc bag to prevent&#xD;
           against oxidation in order to maintain the cacao's integrity.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Student researcher will meet with each parent/family once per week to collect any&#xD;
           questionnaires and to deliver the dark chocolate doses for the subsequent weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Student researcher will meet with teachers at baseline, end of week two, and end of week&#xD;
           four to collect all questionnaires.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Subject will consume 4 squares of the dark chocolate twice daily between the hours of 6&#xD;
           a.m. and 6 p.m.&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. Student researcher will contact parents and teachers weekly via phone/email to follow up&#xD;
           on administration of the chocolate.&#xD;
&#xD;
        9. Parent and primary school teacher will fill out the Autism Spectrum Rating Scale and the&#xD;
           Aberrant Behavior Checklist at the end of week two and at the end of week four.&#xD;
&#xD;
       10. Parent will fill out the Parental Stress Index Questionnaire at the end of week four.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research analysis plan will include non-parametric statistics. For the pre-test and post-test&#xD;
      analysis of the Parental Stress Index scale Friedman's test will be used. For all other&#xD;
      repeated measures such as the Aberrant Behavior Checklist and the Autism Spectrum Rating&#xD;
      Scale the Wilcoxon Signed Rank Test will be used.&#xD;
