      This study aims at assessing the effectiveness of combined suprascapular nerve block (SSNB),&#xD;
      infraclavicular brachial plexus block (ICB) and supraclavicular nerve block (SCNB) as&#xD;
      surgical anesthesia for patients scheduled for arthroscopic shoulder surgery. The secondary&#xD;
      objective is to test the hypothesis that SSNB-ICB-SCNB combination could spare the phrenic&#xD;
      nerve.&#xD;

      Material and Methods This study will be performed according to the declaration of Helsinki.&#xD;
      The institutional review board of the hospital (Clinique Médipôle Garonne, 45 rue de Gironis,&#xD;
      31036, Toulouse) gave its approval (registration n° 2016-202). Written consent for&#xD;
      publication will been obtained from each patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients This prospective study will be conducted in the Department of Orthopedic surgery of&#xD;
      Clinique Médipôle Garonne. Patients will be included from June 2017 to July 2017. Patients&#xD;
      undergoing ambulatory arthroscopic shoulder surgery (acromioplasty and supraspinatus tendon&#xD;
      repair) will be screened. Exclusion criteria are: age &lt;18 years, brachial plexus&#xD;
      neuropathies, acute respiratory distress, coagulopathies, systemic glucocorticoid use,&#xD;
      pregnancy, routine use of opioid medications, intolerance for one or more medication of the&#xD;
      study protocol and diabetes. All the patients will be operated on by the same surgeon (Dr&#xD;
      Duport M.) and regional anesthesia will performed by experienced anesthetists (PM, CC, FF and&#xD;
      MM).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Settings Before regional anesthesia (T1), the first sonographic evaluation of the diaphragm&#xD;
      will performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will be monitored in accordance with current guidelines, including non-invasive&#xD;
      blood pressure as well as continuous electrocardiogram and pulse oximetry. The combination of&#xD;
      infraclavicular brachial plexus block (ICB) (ropivacaine 0.375%, 20 mL), suprascapular nerve&#xD;
      block (SSNB) (ropivacaine 0.375%, 5 mL) and supraclavicular nerve block (SCNB) (ropivacaine&#xD;
      0.375%, 5 mL) will performed. Systemic dexamethasone (10mg) will be administrated in all&#xD;
      patients to prolong the analgesic effect of regional anesthesia. Shoulder arthroscopy will be&#xD;
      performed in lateral decubitus position. Patients will then be transferred to the&#xD;
      post-anesthesia care unit (PACU). Paracetamol (1 g each 6 hours) and Ketoprofen (100mg twice&#xD;
      a day) will be systematically administered. Rescue analgesia with tramadol (100mg each 8&#xD;
      hours) will be administered if necessary (verbal rating scale (VRS) &gt;3). Before PACU&#xD;
      discharge (T2), a new ultrasonographic diaphragmatic function assessment will be done.&#xD;
      Incidence of dyspnea will also be reported.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be contacted by phone once a day during the first two days after surgery to&#xD;
      analyze the time period to the first opioids request, consumption of tramadol tablets and&#xD;
      overall satisfaction. Patients will be instructed to keep a diary or write down the time when&#xD;
      they took painkillers. Patient satisfaction concerning the procedure will be assessed using&#xD;
      an 11-point scale (0: totally unsatisfied, I would definitively want a different anesthesia /&#xD;
      analgesia method for the next surgery; 10: totally satisfied, I would definitively want the&#xD;
      same anesthesia / analgesia method for the next surgery).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Regional anesthesia procedure Regional anesthesia procedures will be performed with&#xD;
      Ultra-Sound (US) equipment (Sonosite Export, Bothell, USA) by experienced anesthetists. The&#xD;
      ICB will be performed as follow: after skin disinfection, US probe will be placed just below&#xD;
      clavicle inferior to site of needle entry. A 50 mm sonovisible nerve block needle (Ultraplex,&#xD;
      B. Braun, Germany) will be inserted using in-plane technique. Following identification of&#xD;
      axillary artery and cords, the needle will be advanced posterior to axillary artery. Local&#xD;
      anesthetic (LA) (ropivacaine 0.375%, 20 mL) will then be deposited in a U-shaped distribution&#xD;
      posterior and to each side of the axillary artery using as few injections as possible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Then, an in-plane ultrasound-guided SSNB will be performed by locating the brachial plexus&#xD;
      and the departure of the suprascapular nerve (SSN) from the superior trunk under the inferior&#xD;
      belly of the omohyoid muscle by sliding the transducer distally and then injecting 5 mL of&#xD;
      ropivacaine 0.375% in order to surround the nerve with local anesthetic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As previously described, the SCNB will be performed injecting 5 mL of ropivacaine 0.375% in&#xD;
      the intermuscular plane between the sternocleidomastoid and scalene muscles using a lateral&#xD;
      to medial in-plane technique. The supraclavicular nerve is a terminal branch of the&#xD;
      superficial cervical plexus that supplies the skin overlying the shoulder.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Any instances requiring unscheduled conversion to general anesthesia intraoperatively will be&#xD;
      considered as a regional anesthesia failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The success of this combination of peripheral nerves blocks is supported by a precise&#xD;
      innervation analysis of the shoulder. The anterior aspect of the shoulder joint is supplied&#xD;
      by the posterior cord (which provides the subscapular and axillary nerves) and the lateral&#xD;
      cord of brachial plexus ( which provides the lateral pectoral nerve). The posterior shoulder&#xD;
      joint is innervated by the suprascapular nerve, which originates from the most proximal&#xD;
      section of the superior trunk, as well as small branches of the axillary nerve. Combination&#xD;
      of ICB and SSNB allows anesthesia of these nerves originating from the brachial plexus.&#xD;
      However, cutaneous innervation of the shoulder is complex and partially mediated by the&#xD;
      supraclavicular nerve. A block of this terminal branch of the superficial cervical plexus can&#xD;
      be easily performed injecting the LA solution in the intermuscular plane between the&#xD;
      sternocleidomastoid and scalene muscles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ultrasonographic diaphragmatic function assessment Diaphragmatic function will be evaluated&#xD;
      using M-mode ultrasonography according to previously described techniques. With the patient&#xD;
      in a semi sitting position with the head elevated approximately 30 degrees, diaphragmatic&#xD;
      sonography will be performed using a 3.5-5 MHz phased array probe. The probe will be placed&#xD;
      immediately below the right or left costal margin in the right or left anterior axillary line&#xD;
      and was directed medially, cephalad and dorsally, so that the ultrasound beam reached&#xD;
      perpendicularly the posterior third of the corresponding hemi-diaphragm. The two-dimensional&#xD;
      (2D) mode will initially be used to obtain the best approach and to select the exploration&#xD;
      line; the M-mode will then be used to display the motion of the anatomical structures along&#xD;
      the selected line. Patients will be scanned along the long axis of the intercostal spaces,&#xD;
      with the liver serving as an acoustic window to the right, and the spleen to the left. Normal&#xD;
      inspiratory diaphragmatic movement is caudal, since the diaphragm moves toward the probe;&#xD;
      normal expiratory trace is cranial, as the diaphragm moves away from the probe. In M-mode,&#xD;
      the diaphragm appeares as a crisp white, hyperechoic line slowly undulating through the&#xD;
      respiratory cycle. Patients will be then asked to perform a &quot;voluntary sniff&quot; (VS) test, for&#xD;
      which patients will be asked to forcefully inhale through the nose in a sniffing fashion.&#xD;
      Diaphragmatic excursion from baseline will be measured in centimeters using the digital&#xD;
      calipers on the ultrasound machine interface. A normal upward movement (toward the probe)&#xD;
      will be designated positive. A paradoxical downward movement is designated negative. Two&#xD;
      measurements will be made, and the largest displacement will be taken as the referred value.&#xD;
      The above measurements will be performed immediately preceding nerves blockade, and then just&#xD;
      before PACU discharge. As previously described, complete hemi diaphragmatic paralysis is&#xD;
      defined as a greater than 75% reduction in diaphragmatic excursion measured in the VS test13.&#xD;
      Partial paralysis is defined as a 25% to 75% reduction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data analysis Data analysis for this study is largely descriptive, including percentages and&#xD;
      counts for categorical data and medians with 25th to 75th interquartile ranges (IQRs) for&#xD;
      continuous data. The primary outcome is the success rate of regional anesthesia (i.e.&#xD;
      intraoperative conversion to general anesthesia was considered as a regional anesthesia&#xD;
      failure). The secondary outcomes are; analysis of diaphragmatic paralysis, dyspnea,&#xD;
      post-operative analgesia duration and patient satisfaction. Data were analyzed using&#xD;
      Microsoft Excel (Microsoft, Redmond, Washington).&#xD;

    <description>This study aims at assessing the effectiveness of combined supra scapular nerve block, infraclavicular block and supraclavicular nerve block as surgical anesthesia for patients scheduled for arthroscopic shoulder surgery.&#xD;
These blocks are performed for decades in routine care. The originality of this study is to analyze the combination of these different blocks for post-operative pain relief in arthroscopic shoulder surgery. This combination can be considered as an alternative to interscalene block well known to be associated with diaphragmatic paralysis.&#xD;
Local anesthetics used in this study are used for many years in routine care: Ropivacaine 0.375%. A single injection will be performed under ultrasounds. No continuous injection will be performed.</description>
