  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Stroke is the third most common cause of death and the main cause of acquired adult&#xD;
      disability in high-income countries. The most common deficit after stroke is motor impairment&#xD;
      of the contralateral arm, with more than 80% of stroke survivors experiencing this condition&#xD;
      in the acute phase, and only half regaining some useful upper limb function after six months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Within the European project RETRAINER (grant agreement No 644721), the consortium developed a&#xD;
      platform for the rehabilitation of the upper limb after stroke, which combines a passive&#xD;
      forearm-hand orthosis for hand-wrist motion stabilization, selective fingers constraining and&#xD;
      grasp movement facilitation, Functional Electrical Stimulation (FES) of the extrinsic hand&#xD;
      flexor muscles and of the extrinsic hand extensor muscles, interactive objects, and voluntary&#xD;
      effort. The system also provides a graphical user interface which helps the therapist set the&#xD;
      training session and save the training data and parameters, and provides the subject a visual&#xD;
      feedback about his/her active involvement in the exercise. The training consists of the&#xD;
      execution of a series of exercises involving the affected arm during daily life activities.&#xD;
      Typical exercises include controlled wrist flexion and extension, controlled fingers flexion&#xD;
      and extension, anterior reaching and grasping on a plane or in the space, moving an object on&#xD;
      a plane or in the space.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this clinical study it to evaluate the efficacy of this novel training platform on&#xD;
      patients between two weeks and nine months after their first stroke, who preserved at least a&#xD;
      visible muscle contraction for the arm and shoulder muscles. Participants are randomized in&#xD;
      an experimental and a control group. The control group is trained with an advanced&#xD;
      rehabilitative program, including physical training, occupational therapy, FES, and virtual&#xD;
      reality, while the experimental group is trained with the RETRAINER system for about 30&#xD;
      minutes, in addition to the same program of the control group. The daily training time is the&#xD;
      same for the two groups. The intervention consists of three sessions a week for nine weeks.&#xD;
      Patients are assessed at baseline, soon after the end of the intervention, and in a 4-week&#xD;
      follow-up visits. It is planned to recruit 68 subjects for this study. Since the RETRAINER&#xD;
      platform was built on the up-to-date theory of motor re-learning, which supports&#xD;
      task-oriented repetitive training, a close temporal association between motor intention and&#xD;
      stimulated motor response, and an intensive and frequent training paradigm, the study's&#xD;
      hypothesis is that the experimental group shows a greater treatment effect than the control&#xD;
      group.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is multi-center randomized controlled trial designed according to the CONSORT Statement&#xD;
      recommendations. A total of 68 patients will be recruited in the two centers. This sample&#xD;
      size was a-priori calculated as capable to detect a clinically important between-group&#xD;
      difference of 5.7 points in the primary endpoint Action Research Arm Test, considering a&#xD;
      standard deviation of 12.5, a type I error of 5%, and a power of 80%. More technical details&#xD;
      on the RETRAINER platform for the rehabilitation of the arm are here reported. The&#xD;
      experimental setup consists of: a passive forearm-hand orthosis; a current controlled&#xD;
      stimulator with one stimulation channel multiplexed to 48 active sites, developed by &quot;Hasomed&#xD;
      GmbH&quot;; 4-by-4 electrode arrays used for transcutaneous NeuroMuscular Electrical Stimulation&#xD;
      (NMES), developed by Translational Neural Engineering Laboratory - École Polytechnique&#xD;
      Fédérale De Lausanne (TNE-EPFL); and interactive objects, which are daily life objects&#xD;
      equipped with Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) tags used to identify the target&#xD;
      positions so as to drive the execution of the rehabilitation exercises. A suitable reader is&#xD;
      embedded in the exoskeleton with the antenna on the wrist joint. The control system is shared&#xD;
      between an Embedded Control System (ECS), running on a BeagleBoneBlackTM, for real-time&#xD;
      operation, and a Windows-based table (Microsoft Surface 3 running Windows 8), which provides&#xD;
      a graphical user interface (GUI) for the therapist and the patient. The Orthosis is&#xD;
      characterized by a thermoplastic bar, shaped to conform to the dorsal hand-forearm aspect,&#xD;
      and aimed at hand-wrist stabilization; thermoelastic clasps aimed at selective fingers&#xD;
      constraining and grasp movement facilitation; the motion of hand, wrist, and fingers is&#xD;
      monitored with three inertial sensors (&quot;Invensense MPU-9250&quot;). To allow the use on patients&#xD;
      within the 5-th and 95-th percentile, the thermoplastic bar hosts are available in 5 sizes,&#xD;
      and the elastic clasps are available in 11 sizes. The stimulation is provided through&#xD;
      stimulation maps with one or more active virtual electrodes, selected by the therapist based&#xD;
      on the subject specific needs. Depending on the task, stimulation on extensors and flexors is&#xD;
      applied to match the desired kinematic hand configuration. In case the desired extension (or&#xD;
      flexion) is reached though stimulation or residual volitional control, stimulation intensity&#xD;
      is reduced accordingly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The stimulation frequency is set at 25 Hz, the pulse width is fixed at 300μs, while the&#xD;
      stimulation intensity is set at the beginning of the training session on each muscle&#xD;
      individually at a value tolerated by the subject and able to induce a functional movement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Custom electrode arrays are placed over forearm muscle belly. A fast and automatic&#xD;
      calibration procedure is required before the beginning of each session. This procedure aims&#xD;
      at setting the current amplitude values for each Virtual Electrode in use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The control interface of the system, implemented in .Net 4.6, provides a GUI including&#xD;
      multiple software tools to organize rehabilitation exercises and monitor rehabilitation&#xD;
      progress. The heart of the control interface is a State Machine, which drives both the&#xD;
      parameterization and the execution of the exercises. Each exercise is divided into single&#xD;
      tasks: the State Machine drives the exercise execution throughout the tasks, while the&#xD;
      execution of each single task is controlled by the ECS. The ECS controls all the modules&#xD;
      requiring real time constraints, such as the stimulator, the FES controller and the orthosis&#xD;
      sensors. To keep the control interface and the ECS synchronized, a strict master slave&#xD;
      concept using a custom made communication protocol was implemented, meaning that the ECS must&#xD;
      not act independently, but only reacts to commands sent by the high level control.&#xD;
      Transitions between states of the state machine and thus tasks of the exercise are triggered&#xD;
      by angle sensors data, RFID data or a timer (depending on the task). Transitions have to&#xD;
      fulfill certain conditions, so called guards. These guards are predefined for each task and&#xD;
      have to be parameterized as described in the Section D. The GUI guides the user through the&#xD;
      training by providing visual instructions and feedback. The workflow of a typical training&#xD;
      session consists of four main phases: the setting, donning and parameterization of the&#xD;
      system, and the training following a pre-defined sequence of exercises. The control interface&#xD;
      supports the therapist and the patient throughout all the phases via the GUI. The setting&#xD;
      starts with the therapist creating a new user, or selecting an existent one, calibrating the&#xD;
      inertial sensors, and selecting the exercises. Afterwards, the donning phase starts with the&#xD;
      placement of the electrode arrays for stimulation. Once the Virtual Electrodes placement and&#xD;
      intensity is checked, the therapist should don the orthosis of appropriate size on the&#xD;
      patient, and position the inertial sensors on the orthosis and on the fingers clasps. The&#xD;
      following step is the calibration of the FES controller by means of the automatic procedure&#xD;
      previously described. On the following training days, the setting and donning procedure is&#xD;
      partly simplified since the therapist can load the settings of the previous day and&#xD;
      eventually adjust them, and use the pre-identified orthoses that best fit the subject. A&#xD;
      parameterization step is designed to set the guards of the State Machine. In this process the&#xD;
      GUI guides the patient and the therapist through each task of the selected exercises with&#xD;
      stimulation. The patient-specific parameters for each task, such as the target positions, the&#xD;
      desired time for the execution of each task, and the time of the relax phases, are&#xD;
      determined. At the end of the parameterization phase, all the parameters are stored and the&#xD;
      training session can start. The training consists of the execution of a series of exercises&#xD;
      involving the hand during daily life activities. Typical exercises are grasping an object,&#xD;
      flexing and extending fingers, flexing and extending the wrist, anterior reaching on a plane&#xD;
      or in the space, moving an object on a plane or in the space, with or without an object in&#xD;
      the hand. The execution of the exercises is controlled by the control interface which leads&#xD;
      the patient throughout the single tasks by means of both visual and audio messages via the&#xD;
      GUI.&#xD;
