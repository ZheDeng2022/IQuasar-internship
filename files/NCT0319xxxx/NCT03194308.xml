  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Women who choose to conceive with an infected or unknown serostatus partner in HIV-endemic&#xD;
      settings need prevention strategies to reduce periconception HIV acquisition risk. Women at&#xD;
      high risk for acquiring HIV during pregnancy need risk reduction strategies to protect&#xD;
      themselves and their babies. Evaluating uptake of and adherence to antiretrovirals as&#xD;
      pre-exposure prophylaxis in this population is crucial to understanding whether and how this&#xD;
      novel prevention strategy should be incorporated into HIV-risk reduction packages for at-&#xD;
      risk women planning or with pregnancy.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In HIV-endemic settings, many HIV-uninfected women choose to conceive with an HIV-infected or&#xD;
      unknown-serostatus partner. For a woman who cannot depend on a partner to test, initiate and&#xD;
      adhere to ART, sex without condoms puts her at high risk of acquiring HIV and increases the&#xD;
      risk of perinatal transmission to her child. Daily, oral TDF/FTC PrEP dramatically reduces a&#xD;
      woman's risk of HIV-acquisition and is the only female-controlled option for reducing the&#xD;
      risk of periconception HIV-acquisition. Understanding whether daily, oral PrEP is feasible&#xD;
      for uninfected women seeking pregnancy is critical to reducing HIV incidence among women and&#xD;
      their children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Placebo-controlled trials identified adherence as a major challenge to long-term PrEP use.&#xD;
      However, women are eager for prevention strategies that allow for conception, and we&#xD;
      hypothesize that adherence to a proven prevention strategy, for a limited time with the&#xD;
      motivation to have a healthy child, will confer drug levels required to prevent HIV&#xD;
      transmission. This project will inform whether daily, oral PrEP is a feasible HIV-prevention&#xD;
      strategy for South African women who intend to conceive with risky partners. Given the&#xD;
      repercussions of acquiring HIV during conception and pregnancy, this is an important step&#xD;
      towards providing a key prevention strategy to women and their children.&#xD;
