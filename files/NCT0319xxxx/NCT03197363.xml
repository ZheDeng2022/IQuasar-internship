      The main goal of the study is to provide a unique multidimensional picture of the health of&#xD;
      the population with simultaneous optimal standards of sampling, processing and storing of&#xD;
      data and biomaterial that will allow discovering novel mechanisms in the development and&#xD;
      progression of common civilization diseases. In the effect it will improve prevention,&#xD;
      diagnosis and treatment.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      One of the objectives of this project is to obtain comprehensive information on the health&#xD;
      status (including subclinical disorders), genomics, risk factors, health behavior and&#xD;
      sociodemographic data from large, representative sample of population of Białystok city&#xD;
      inhabitants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will assess many systems, the major emphasis will be given to the most common&#xD;
      diseases associated with modern lifestyle (civilization diseases): cardiovascular, metabolic&#xD;
      and endocrine, neurodegenerative, neoplastic and pulmonary. There are many interactions&#xD;
      between them that might be missed when not analyzed together. Apart from those most common&#xD;
      diseases we will also asses others, including allergies, airway dysfunction - both upper and&#xD;
      lower, urinary incontinency, gastrointestinal disorders, eye diseases. There may be many&#xD;
      common underlying mechanisms of the diseases that now seem to be distant and independent,&#xD;
      because of insufficient knowledge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Health status assessment will refer to many areas of medicine and will include clinical data,&#xD;
      medical images, as well as biological samples and voice recording samples. We plan to combine&#xD;
      imaging (fundoscopy, ultrasound examinations of heart, vessels, thyroid, liver) with state of&#xD;
      the art functional studies (AGE measurement, pulse wave velocity, central pressure,&#xD;
      plethysmography with the analysis of diffusing capacity of lung for carbon monoxide and NO&#xD;
      concentration, spiroergometry, oral glucose tolerance test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Voice samples will be analyzed in the speech analysis software, it will help in the diagnosis&#xD;
      of civilization diseases such as diabetes, depression, and atherosclerosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will fill in detailed questionnaires that will provide information about their&#xD;
      family history, dietary habits, socioeconomic status, stress coping strategies, lifestyle,&#xD;
      exposure to harmful environment, various symptoms, history of diagnosed diseases and&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is designed as prospective, so in the future, additional information on occurrence&#xD;
      of diseases or deaths will allow to estimate disease incidence, morbidity or mortality in&#xD;
      studied population.&#xD;
