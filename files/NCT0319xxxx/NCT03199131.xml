  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronically elevated pulmonary pressures do not immediately result in right ventricular&#xD;
      failure. During the initial period of exposure, the RV adapts to the increased afterload by&#xD;
      altering its metabolism and morphology so as to meet the increased work requirement. Several,&#xD;
      interconnected adaptive mechanisms have been proposed, including myocyte hypertrophy, a&#xD;
      switch in the primary fuel used for ATP generation, increased angiogenesis, and decreased&#xD;
      production of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species. While adaptation is initially successful&#xD;
      in many cases, it is temporary, and after an uncertain period of time, the ventricle begins&#xD;
      to fail. This transition from a compensated to decompensated state is difficult to predict&#xD;
      clinically, and patients with different etiologies of CPOS progress to overt RV failure over&#xD;
      significantly different time periods. This variability hinders the implementation of&#xD;
      treatments that are tailored to a specific disease stage.&#xD;

      clinically, and patients with different etiologies of CPOS progress to overt RV failure over&#xD;
      significantly different time periods. This variability hinders the implementation of&#xD;
      treatments that are tailored to a specific disease stage. As right heart failure is the&#xD;
      primary outcome determinant in patients with pulmonary hypertension, understanding the major&#xD;
      mediators of RV compensation, failure and recovery is essential to improving patient&#xD;
      survival. Recently, there have been significant advances in the ability to assess RV function&#xD;
      in vivo using functional imaging techniques, including positron emission tomography (PET) and&#xD;
      cardiac MRI (CMR). CMR is an established and validated method of precisely defining cardiac&#xD;
      structure and function, and new PET protocols have been developed that measure glucose&#xD;
      utilization, oxygen consumption, apoptosis and angiogenesis. Importantly, the in vivo nature&#xD;
      of PET and CMR allow for the non-invasive collection of detailed structural, metabolic and&#xD;
      physiologic data on the performance of the RV5. When taken in combination with established&#xD;
      echocardiographic evaluation, these new platforms allow in-depth analysis of cardiac&#xD;
      structure and function without the need for invasive procedures. In order to maximize the&#xD;
      potential of these techniques, however, a molecular imaging target needs to be identified so&#xD;
      as to allow physicians to detect the transition from a compensated to decompensated state.&#xD;
      Such a marker has not yet been reported&#xD;
