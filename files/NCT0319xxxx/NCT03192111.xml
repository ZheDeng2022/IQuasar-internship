    <textblock>
      This purpose of this study is to evaluate the effects of a single dose of entinostat on&#xD;
      subjects with varying levels of renal impairment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the pharmacokinetics of a single dose of&#xD;
      entinostat in adult subjects with mild, moderate and severe renal impairment compared to&#xD;
      healthy mean-matched subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objective of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of&#xD;
      entinostat in adult subjects with mild, moderate, and severe renal impairment and in healthy&#xD;
      mean-matched adult subjects.&#xD;
