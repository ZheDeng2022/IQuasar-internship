  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the feasibility and preliminary efficacy of a web&#xD;
      and text-messaged based intervention designed to increase physical activity among Latino men&#xD;
      in Rhode Island. The study will also examine potential moderators of treatment effects&#xD;
      including demographics, acculturation, and environmental variables such as the neighborhood&#xD;
      built, social and economic environments.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Physical Activity in Latino Men Through Tailoring is an individually randomized web and text&#xD;
      message based pilot study, designed to increase physical activity amongst Latino men. The&#xD;
      study is conducting formative research with a diverse population of Latino men to inform the&#xD;
      adaptation of the Pasos Hacia La Salud web-based intervention, which was developed for Latina&#xD;
      women, to an intervention focused on Latino men. Consideration will also be taken to ensure&#xD;
      intervention material is culturally appropriate for Latino men of Caribbean, South and&#xD;
      Central American origin. Half the study participants will be randomized into the intervention&#xD;
      arm and half into the comparison group. Participants in the intervention arm will have access&#xD;
      to a website where they can complete questionnaires, receive information, log their physical&#xD;
      activity and set goals. Participants complete monthly questionnaires to establish their stage&#xD;
      of change toward increasing their physical activity and receive information manuals based on&#xD;
      their current stage of change. They will also have access to tip sheets via the study website&#xD;
      and receive reoccurring text messages reminding them to log into the website. Participants in&#xD;
      the comparison arm will have access to a similar website with information related to&#xD;
      nutrition and overall wellness, not including physical activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary aims of this project are (1) to conduct formative research with a diverse&#xD;
      population of RI Latino men to adapt the existing web-based interventions and add text&#xD;
      message-based components to complement and enhance the intervention. The second primary aim&#xD;
      is to determine the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary efficacy of the intervention&#xD;
      and the study recruitment, implementation and evaluation protocols with a diverse population&#xD;
      of Latino men. An additional exploratory aim will be to examine potential moderators of&#xD;
      treatment effects including demographics, acculturation, and environmental variables such as&#xD;
      the neighborhood built, social and economic environments. The hypothesis is that participants&#xD;
      randomized to the intervention condition will have greater increases in weekly minutes of&#xD;
      physical activity after six months than those randomized to a wellness control condition. The&#xD;
      results of this pilot study will inform a future randomized controlled trial with Latino men&#xD;
      to increase PA.&#xD;

    <description>After randomization into the intervention arm, participants will be instructed on how to use the Spanish language study website. During the six month intervention, they will complete online questionnaires to determine their stage of change towards increasing physical activity. A manual of information will be automatically generated based on their responses. Participants can read this information online, along with tip sheets related to increasing physical activity. On the website they can also set weekly goals and log their weekly PA. It will also include short videos with demonstrations for PA they can do at home and around their neighborhood. Information will also include community resources (community centers, public events, parks) where they can be physically active. Participants will also receive prompts and encouragement via text-message to encourage them to log into the website and continue to track their progress.</description>

    <description>Participants in the control arm will attend the same baseline orientation sessions and measurements as the intervention arm. After randomization into the control group, participants will complete an introductory in-person session to introduce them to a website, similar in design, with information on health topics other than physical activity, including diet and other factors associated with CVD risk. It will include information from NHLBI heart health materials for Latinos. Topics include healthy eating, increasing fruit and vegetable consumption, reducing fat and salt intake, learning about cholesterol, stress management. Participants will log onto a separate website unique to the control group and complete monthly surveys on the wellness topics and their progress. Participants will also receive prompts and encouragement text-messages to encourage them to log onto the website.</description>
