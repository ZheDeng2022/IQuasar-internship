  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective randomized study which will be done at main campus Cleveland Clinic.&#xD;
      The investigators will be comparing the colon cleansing by the Boston Bowel Preparation Scale&#xD;
      in participants undergoing colonoscopy as an inpatient at our hospital. Participants will be&#xD;
      randomized to the the standard of care (4 Liter polyethylene glycol based preparation) or a&#xD;
      low volume bowel preparation (sodium picosulfate, a stimulant laxative, magnesium oxide and&#xD;
      anhydrous citric acid (SP/MC)). Both agents will either be administered as full dose the&#xD;
      evening before or as split-dose on the evening before and on the day of the procedure.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of our study is to determine if a 4L bowel cleansing agent is more effective than&#xD;
      a low volume bowel preparation, and if the time of dosing (single dose night before vs split&#xD;
      dose) of the bowel preparation results in better bowel cleansing in participants undergoing&#xD;
      colonoscopy. Eligible participants undergoing colonoscopy with conscious sedation will be&#xD;
      randomly assigned to one of two bowel preparations and one of two dosing schemas of bowel&#xD;
      preparation. Participants not eligible for conscious sedation and are undergoing colonoscopy&#xD;
      with general anesthesia will be randomized only to the single dose arms of the study.&#xD;
      Participants will complete a questionnaire while drinking the bowel preparation to determine&#xD;
      timing and tolerability of the bowel preparation.&#xD;

    <time_frame>1 day</time_frame>
    <description>Bowel cleansing efficacy will be measured using the Boston Bowel Prep Scale (BBPS). The BBPS divides the colon into 3 segments (right, transverse, left); each is scored from 0-3 (0=colonic mucosa not seen due to solid stool that cannot be cleared, 1=only a portion of the mucosa of the colon segment is seen due to staining, residual stool and/or opaque liquid, 2=minor amount of residual staining, small fragments of stool and/or opaque liquid but mucosa of colon segment is seen well, and 3=entire mucosa is seen well with no residual staining, small fragments of stool or opaque liquid). A total BBPS score of 6 or greater AND 2 or greater in all segments will be defined as satisfactory bowel prep. BBPS score of less than 6 or less than 2 in any segment of the colon will be taken as unsatisfactory bowel cleansing in the final analysis.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Participants With Satisfactory Bowel Cleansing</title>
        <description>Bowel cleansing efficacy will be measured using the Boston Bowel Prep Scale (BBPS). The BBPS divides the colon into 3 segments (right, transverse, left); each is scored from 0-3 (0=colonic mucosa not seen due to solid stool that cannot be cleared, 1=only a portion of the mucosa of the colon segment is seen due to staining, residual stool and/or opaque liquid, 2=minor amount of residual staining, small fragments of stool and/or opaque liquid but mucosa of colon segment is seen well, and 3=entire mucosa is seen well with no residual staining, small fragments of stool or opaque liquid). A total BBPS score of 6 or greater AND 2 or greater in all segments will be defined as satisfactory bowel prep. BBPS score of less than 6 or less than 2 in any segment of the colon will be taken as unsatisfactory bowel cleansing in the final analysis.</description>
