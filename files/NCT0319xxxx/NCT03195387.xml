    <textblock>
      This study follows a First-In-Human dose-escalation study of MMV390048 (5 to 120 mg MMV390048&#xD;
      powder-in-bottle formulation), a formulation bioavailability study to establish suitable&#xD;
      tablet formulation, and a two-part dose-escalation (40 to 120 mg of MMV390048) / induced&#xD;
      blood stage malaria (ISBM) challenge study with the new tablet formulation. After&#xD;
      identification of the predicted efficacious MMV390048 plasma concentrations in the IBSM&#xD;
      model, the current study will evaluate the chemoprotective efficacy of MMV390048 in a&#xD;
      standardised and validated controlled human malaria infection (CHMI) model using direct&#xD;
      venous inoculation (DVI) of aseptic, purified, cryopreserved, vialed P. falciparum&#xD;
      sporozoites (PfSPZ Challenge).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Three sequential cohorts of healthy men and women of non-childbearing potential (WONCBP) will&#xD;
      be administered the investigational medicinal product (IMP, i.e. MMV390048) under different&#xD;
      conditions. This may identify preventative regimens, to be further investigated in a Phase II&#xD;
      program. In the first two cohorts, protective administration of the IMP will occur 1 and 7&#xD;
      days before DVI of PfSPZ challenge. The timing of IMP administration and dosage in the last&#xD;
      cohort will be determined on the basis of emerging data from the preceding cohorts, but will&#xD;
      not exceed 28 days prior to the challenge nor 120 mg MMV390048.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Subjects are enrolled into one of three cohorts of 12 subjects each. Cohorts are recruited&#xD;
      sequentially, to facilitate on-going review of data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigational medicinal product (IMP) administration takes place between 28 and 1 days&#xD;
      before the P. falciparum sporozoites (PfSPZ) challenge. Subjects are randomised to receive&#xD;
      either MMV390048 120 mg or placebo in a 3:1 ratio.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After IMP administration, each subject is inoculated with 3200 PfSPZ. The dose of IMP to be&#xD;
      administered and the interval between IMP administration and the PfSPZ challenge are as&#xD;
      follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cohort 1: Subjects receive a single oral dose of MMV390048 (9 subjects) or placebo (3&#xD;
           subjects) on Day -1, prior to PfSPZ challenge on Day 0.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cohort 2: Subjects receive a single oral dose of MMV390048 (9 subjects) or placebo (3&#xD;
           subjects) on Day -7, prior to PfSPZ Challenge on Day 0.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cohort 3: Subjects receive a single oral dose of MMV390048 (9 subjects; dose to be&#xD;
           determined) or placebo (3 subjects) on a day (to be determined) prior to PfSPZ challenge&#xD;
           on Day 0. IMP dosage and day of administration will be determined on the basis of data&#xD;
           emerging from the first two cohorts, but will not exceed 120 mg nor 28 days prior to&#xD;
           PfSPZ challenge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Parasitaemia and malaria symptoms and signs are monitored daily from Day 6 and as long as&#xD;
      subjects exhibit parasitaemia (defined as either a positive thick blood smear microscopy or&#xD;
      three positive quantitative polymerase chain reactions at least 12 hours apart with one&#xD;
      measurement greater 100 parasites per mL), or until Day 28 if no parasitemia is not detected.&#xD;
      All subjects receive antimalarial rescue therapy upon positive parasitaemia or at the end of&#xD;
      the treatment period if parasites are not detected during follow-up. A final safety follow-up&#xD;
      visit takes place on Day 60.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After treating cohorts 1 and 2 (up to, and including Day 28 assessments), a safety review&#xD;
      team (SRT) meeting takes place, to consider enrolment of the subsequent cohort. At the first&#xD;
      meeting, the SRT reviews safety and parasitaemia data to Day 28 and determines whether&#xD;
      progression to treatment of cohort 2 is indicated. If no safety concerns are identified by&#xD;
      the SRT and the geometric mean time to parasitaemia is less than 12 days for Cohort 1,&#xD;
      progression to Cohort 2 takes place. Should Cohort 2 be enrolled, safety and parasitaemia&#xD;
      data to Day 28 and PK data to at least Day 14 from this cohort are reviewed by the SRT prior&#xD;
      to enrolling Cohort 3.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment of cohort 3 will be put on hold if:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Any inoculum- or MMV390048-related SAEs are reported, or&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Two or more MMV390048-related severe (Grade 3 or higher) adverse events are reported in&#xD;
           the same organ class, or&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Any significant inoculum-related adverse event is reported which may place subjects in a&#xD;
           subsequent cohort at risk, or&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Any other critical findings are identified which may place subjects in a subsequent&#xD;
           cohort at risk.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dosing of a subsequent cohort at the same or lower dose with the same or increased interval&#xD;
      between dosing and inoculation, will not be performed if:&#xD;
&#xD;
      â€¢ The cohort-specific geometric mean time to parasitaemia is less than 12 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If progression of the study to recruiting cohort 3 is approved the by SRT, the optimal dose&#xD;
      of MMV390048, as well as the time point of its administration will be estimated based on PK&#xD;
      modelling, using data from all trials and assuming that asexual liver and blood stage have&#xD;
      similar MMV390048 sensitivities.&#xD;
