  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Quantitative Flow Ratio (QFR) is a novel method for evaluating the functional significance of&#xD;
      coronary stenosis. The purpose of the FAVOR II China study is to evaluate the diagnostic&#xD;
      accuracy of on-line QFR with FFR as the reference standard. The secondary purpose is to&#xD;
      compare the diagnostic accuracies between online QFR and online QCA, with FFR as the&#xD;
      reference standard.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients at high risk of having one or more coronary stenosis are evaluated routinely by&#xD;
      invasive coronary angiography. Lesions are often quantified by QCA, but fractional flow&#xD;
      reserve is increasingly used to assess functional significance of identified stenosis. FFR is&#xD;
      assessed during CAG by advancing a wire with a pressure transducer towards the stenosis and&#xD;
      measure the ratio in pressure between the two sides of the stenosis during medical induced&#xD;
      maximum blood flow (hyperemia).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The solid evidence for FFR evaluation of coronary stenosis and the relative simplicity in&#xD;
      performing the measurements have supported adoption of an FFR based strategy in many centers&#xD;
      but the need for interrogating the stenosis by a pressure wire, the cost of the wire, and the&#xD;
      drug inducing hyperemia limits more widespread adoption.&#xD;
&#xD;
      QFR is a novel method for evaluating the functional significance of coronary stenosis by&#xD;
      calculation of the pressure drop in the vessel based on two angiographic projections. The&#xD;
      FAVOR Pilot study (Tu et al.) showed promising results for core laboratory QFR analysis in&#xD;
      selected patients. However, the accuracy of QFR when assessed online in the catheterization&#xD;
      laboratory is unknown. The purpose of the FAVOR II China study is to evaluate the diagnostic&#xD;
      accuracy of on-line QFR with FFR as the reference standard. The secondary purpose is to&#xD;
      compare the diagnostic accuracies between online QFR and online QCA, with FFR as the&#xD;
      reference standard. It is a prospective and multi-center trial with a total of 308 patients&#xD;
      conducted at 5 Chinese centers.&#xD;
