      This study is comparing a multidisciplinary intervention for encopresis (MIE), consisting of&#xD;
      both medical and behavioral components to treatment as usual control (TAU). Participants are&#xD;
      first screened by a pediatric gastroenterologist and assessed and treated for any&#xD;
      constipation or other potential medical complications. Following this, caregivers collect&#xD;
      data on bowel movements and continence during a home baseline lasting no less than 14 days&#xD;
      and no more than 21 days. Participants randomly assigned to treatment as usual or the&#xD;
      treatment group, and begin attending daily appointments in clinic for 2 weeks. At&#xD;
      appointments, the behavior team implements structured sits on the toilet to promote&#xD;
      independent bowel movements (BMs). If an independent BM does not occur, the study team will&#xD;
      administer a suppository to promote rapid release of the bowels and prompt the child to&#xD;
      remain on the toilet following administration. In doing so, continent bowel movements are&#xD;
      predictably evoked while the child is on the toilet, allowing for reinforcement with praise&#xD;
      and preferred toys/activities. Eventually, suppositories are gradually decreased until the&#xD;
      child is having BMs independently. Caregivers are trained to continue implementing the&#xD;
      intervention following the clinic-based portion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of the current study is to evaluate MIE using a large randomized clinical trial&#xD;
      (RCT), addressing the Department of Defense Autism Research Program, Area of Interest of&#xD;
      Therapies to Alleviate Conditions Co-Occurring with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). The&#xD;
      researchers will recruit 112 children diagnosed with ASD, randomizing them to 1 week of MIE,&#xD;
      or treatment as usual (TAU) consisting of behavioral consultation and medical intervention.&#xD;
      This study will evaluate MIE compared to TAU and determine the optimal treatment length.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Toilet training one's child is a nearly universal challenge for parents, but is a&#xD;
      particularly distressing ordeal for parents of individuals with autism spectrum disorder&#xD;
      (ASD). Whereas typically developing children generally stop having daytime toileting&#xD;
      accidents (i.e., they achieve continence) by 2-4 years of age, most individuals with ASD are&#xD;
      either delayed in their acquisition of toileting skills, or never achieve continence.&#xD;
      Furthermore, toileting concerns are a significant contributor to the increased stress&#xD;
      experienced by caregivers of those with ASD. Besides dramatically increasing their burden of&#xD;
      care, not being fully toilet trained negatively impacts the individual with ASD's hygiene,&#xD;
      self-confidence, physical comfort, and independence while also causing social stigma.&#xD;
      Incontinence can also have serious collateral consequences, such as limiting exposure to&#xD;
      important life experiences. Furthermore, without effective treatment these problems generally&#xD;
      persist into adulthood.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One reason why strictly behavioral treatments of encopresis have shown only limited success&#xD;
      may be due to the fact that it often has a medical etiology. Encopresis is when underwear are&#xD;
      soiled by stool in children over the age of toilet training and long-standing constipation is&#xD;
      the cause of encopresis in the majority of children who exhibit it. Children with ASD are&#xD;
      more likely to have constipation than typically developing children. Constipation causes&#xD;
      encopresis by creating a cycle of withholding bowel movements (withholding is the voluntary&#xD;
      contraction of the external sphincter to avoid a bowel movement): constipation causes painful&#xD;
      bowel movements, which triggers further withholding behavior, exacerbating constipation. Over&#xD;
      time the colon adapts by dilating, which leads to larger fecal masses in the rectum. Thus,&#xD;
      the passage of larger and harder (i.e., painful) stools further increases an individual's&#xD;
      withholding behavior. Over time, the rectum and colon become so dilated that the individual&#xD;
      loses sensation. With no urge to defecate, an individual is even more likely to have stool&#xD;
      accumulate in the rectum and is also unable to control bowel movements. Looser stool may leak&#xD;
      around hard stool leading to an unintended leakage and sometimes large evacuation of stool&#xD;
      occurs without the individual realizing it.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although purely medical approaches can successfully treat constipation in individuals with&#xD;
      ASD, they have not shown long term success with encopresis. That is, medical approaches can&#xD;
      treat a single episode of constipation, but without acquiring toileting skills, the&#xD;
      individual is likely to become constipated again, repeating the cycle. Conversely, purely&#xD;
      behavioral strategies have not been shown to be effective at treating encopresis in&#xD;
      individuals with ASD, even when they are not experiencing constipation. One reason for this&#xD;
      lack of success may have to do with the fact that it is often difficult to predict the timing&#xD;
      of a bowel movement so that caregivers can ensure the individual is sitting on the toilet&#xD;
      when one takes place and then reinforce continence. Thus, a multidisciplinary approach&#xD;
      incorporating both medical and behavioral approaches is necessary in the treatment of&#xD;
      encopresis in individuals with ASD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an 8-week, randomized clinical trial of 112 children, ages 5 to 12 years, 11 months&#xD;
      with ASD and encopresis. Subjects will be randomized to receive either two weeks of MIE or&#xD;
      one week of TAU.&#xD;

    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>Participants in this arm will receive the Multidisciplinary Intervention for Encopresis (MIE) for two weeks. MIE consists of daily clinic appointments, each of which lasts until a continent bowel movement occurs or 3 hours elapse. These participants will discontinue the use of medication previously prescribed for the treatment of constipation, other than the suppositories used in the MIE treatment. During MIE, medical professionals resolve any constipation and oversee a regimen of over the counter medications that increase the predictability of a bowel movement.</description>

    <arm_group_type>No Intervention</arm_group_type>
    <description>Participants randomized to the Treatment as Usual (TAU) group will continue to receive outpatient medical treatment of encopresis according to best practice guidelines by the pediatric gastroenterologist. In addition, participants in the TAU group will receive a 2-hour individual appointment in clinic with a doctoral level clinician with extensive experience in behavioral treatments for encopresis. During the appointment, the clinician will review strategies to increase continence by providing parent education on the following topics: how to collect and evaluate data on their child's bowel movements, how to establish and use a sit schedule, identifying behaviors that are precursors to bowel movements and how to use them to increase the probability of a bowel movement being continent, consequences for incontinence, and reinforcement for continence.</description>

  <intervention>
    <intervention_type>Combination Product</intervention_type>
    <intervention_name>MIE Treatment</intervention_name>
    <description>Appointments consist of a series of sitting routines (i.e., &quot;sits&quot;). Each sit consists of 10 min on the toilet, followed by 1 min of standing, then repeating the 10 min on the toilet 1 min off, for 30 cumulative minutes of sitting. The first sit occurs prior to the administration of any medication providing an opportunity for an independent continent bowel movement. If no continent bowel movement occurs, trained staff administer a dose of a liquid glycerin suppository, immediately followed by another sit to ensure any resulting bowel movement is continent. Glycerin suppositories are replaced by bisacodyl if 2 days pass without a continent bowel movement using the liquid glycerin suppository. Behavioral intervention consists of potent positive reinforcers when a continent bowel movement occurs. As independent continent bowel movements begin to occur, the need for the medical regimen diminishes, and is gradually faded out entirely.</description>
