  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase IIIb, single arm, open-label, multi-center study to evaluate the safety and&#xD;
      tolerability of emicizumab in participants with congenital hemophilia A who have documented&#xD;
      inhibitors against Factor VIII (FVIII) at enrollment. Approximately 200 participants, aged 12&#xD;
      or older, will be enrolled in this study and are expected to be enrolled at approximately 85&#xD;
      sites globally. Participants will receive an initial weekly dose of prophylactic emicizumab&#xD;
      subcutaneously for 4 weeks, followed by a weekly maintenance dose subcutaneously for the&#xD;
      remainder of the 2-year treatment period.&#xD;

    <measure>Overall Summary of the Number of Participants With Adverse Events, Severity Assessed According to the World Health Organization (WHO) Toxicity Grading Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>From Baseline until study completion (up to 2 years)</time_frame>
    <description>Investigators sought information on adverse events (AEs) at each contact with participants. The WHO toxicity grading scale was used for assessing AE severity (i.e., intensity of an AE); any AEs not specifically listed in the WHO toxicity grading scale were assessed for severity according to the following grades: Grade 1 is mild; Grade 2 is moderate, Grade 3 is severe; Grade 4 is life-threatening; and Grade 5 is death. Regardless of severity, some AEs may have also met seriousness criteria. The terms &quot;severe&quot; and &quot;serious&quot; are not synonymous; severity and seriousness were independently assessed for each AE. aPCC = activated prothrombin complex concentrate</description>

    <description>Investigators sought information on adverse events (AEs) at each contact with participants. The WHO toxicity grading scale was used for assessing AE severity (i.e., intensity of an AE); any AEs not specifically listed in the WHO toxicity grading scale were assessed for severity according to the following grades: Grade 1 is mild; Grade 2 is moderate, Grade 3 is severe; Grade 4 is life-threatening; and Grade 5 is death. Regardless of severity, some AEs may have also met seriousness criteria. The terms &quot;severe&quot; and &quot;serious&quot; are not synonymous; severity and seriousness were independently assessed for each AE. The AE rate per 100 patient-years was computed as follows: AE Rate = (Number of AEs observed/ Total patient-years at risk)*100. Total patient-years at risk is the sum over all patients of the time intervals (in years) between start of study therapy (study day 1) and the end of follow up.</description>

    <measure>Number of Participants by Hematology and Biochemistry Laboratory Parameter Test Results as Shifts From the WHO Toxicity Grade at Baseline to the Worst WHO Toxicity Grade Post-Baseline</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Weeks 2, 3, and 5; Months 3, 6, 9, 12, and 18; and at Early Termination/Study Completion (up to 24 months)</time_frame>
    <description>The World Health Organization (WHO) toxicity grading scale was used for determining the severity of laboratory abnormalities (i.e., test results outside of the reference range) for hematology and biochemistry parameters; Grade 0 is normal and Grades 1 to 4 represent worsening levels of the parameter outside of the normal range in the specified direction of the abnormality (high and low are above and below the range, respectively). Not every laboratory abnormality qualified as an adverse event (AE). A laboratory test result was reported as an AE if it met any of the following criteria: was accompanied by clinical symptoms; resulted in a change in study treatment; resulted in a medical intervention or a change in concomitant therapy; or was clinically significant in the investigator's judgment. Baseline was defined as the last available assessment prior to first receipt of study drug. Abs = absolute count; SGOT/AST = aspartate aminotransferase; SGPT/ALT = alanine aminotransferase</description>

    <time_frame>From first dose of emicizumab until dose up-titration or withdrawal from treatment (median [min-max] efficacy period: 103.14 [1.1-108.3] weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>The number of bleeds over the efficacy period was analyzed as an ABR using a negative binomial regression model. Treated bleeds: bleeds followed by a hemophilia medication reported to be a &quot;Treatment for bleed&quot;. All bleeds: included both treated and non-treated bleeds. Treated joint bleeds: treated bleeds where bleed type was &quot;joint bleed&quot; accompanied by at least one of following symptoms: &quot;increased swelling or warmth of the skin over the joint&quot;, &quot;increasing pain&quot; or &quot;decreased range of motion or difficulty using the joint compared with baseline&quot;. Treated target joint bleeds: treated joint bleeds that occurred in a target joint, defined as a joint in which ≥3 treated joint bleeds occurred during the 24 weeks prior to study entry. Treated spontaneous bleeds: treated bleeds with no other known contributing factor such as trauma or procedure/surgery. For all bleed types, bleeds due to surgery/procedure were excluded. Bleeds occurring after dose up-titration have been excluded.</description>

        <title>Overall Summary of the Number of Participants With Adverse Events, Severity Assessed According to the World Health Organization (WHO) Toxicity Grading Scale</title>
        <description>Investigators sought information on adverse events (AEs) at each contact with participants. The WHO toxicity grading scale was used for assessing AE severity (i.e., intensity of an AE); any AEs not specifically listed in the WHO toxicity grading scale were assessed for severity according to the following grades: Grade 1 is mild; Grade 2 is moderate, Grade 3 is severe; Grade 4 is life-threatening; and Grade 5 is death. Regardless of severity, some AEs may have also met seriousness criteria. The terms &quot;severe&quot; and &quot;serious&quot; are not synonymous; severity and seriousness were independently assessed for each AE. aPCC = activated prothrombin complex concentrate</description>

        <title>Adverse Events (AEs) Rates Per 100 Patient-Years for All-Grade AEs, Serious AEs, and Grade ≥3 AEs</title>
        <description>Investigators sought information on adverse events (AEs) at each contact with participants. The WHO toxicity grading scale was used for assessing AE severity (i.e., intensity of an AE); any AEs not specifically listed in the WHO toxicity grading scale were assessed for severity according to the following grades: Grade 1 is mild; Grade 2 is moderate, Grade 3 is severe; Grade 4 is life-threatening; and Grade 5 is death. Regardless of severity, some AEs may have also met seriousness criteria. The terms &quot;severe&quot; and &quot;serious&quot; are not synonymous; severity and seriousness were independently assessed for each AE. The AE rate per 100 patient-years was computed as follows: AE Rate = (Number of AEs observed/ Total patient-years at risk)*100. Total patient-years at risk is the sum over all patients of the time intervals (in years) between start of study therapy (study day 1) and the end of follow up.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants by Hematology and Biochemistry Laboratory Parameter Test Results as Shifts From the WHO Toxicity Grade at Baseline to the Worst WHO Toxicity Grade Post-Baseline</title>
        <description>The World Health Organization (WHO) toxicity grading scale was used for determining the severity of laboratory abnormalities (i.e., test results outside of the reference range) for hematology and biochemistry parameters; Grade 0 is normal and Grades 1 to 4 represent worsening levels of the parameter outside of the normal range in the specified direction of the abnormality (high and low are above and below the range, respectively). Not every laboratory abnormality qualified as an adverse event (AE). A laboratory test result was reported as an AE if it met any of the following criteria: was accompanied by clinical symptoms; resulted in a change in study treatment; resulted in a medical intervention or a change in concomitant therapy; or was clinically significant in the investigator's judgment. Baseline was defined as the last available assessment prior to first receipt of study drug. Abs = absolute count; SGOT/AST = aspartate aminotransferase; SGPT/ALT = alanine aminotransferase</description>

Treated bleeds: bleeds followed by a hemophilia medication reported to be a &quot;Treatment for bleed&quot;. All bleeds: included both treated and non-treated bleeds. Treated joint bleeds: treated bleeds where bleed type was &quot;joint bleed&quot; accompanied by at least one of following symptoms: &quot;increased swelling or warmth of the skin over the joint&quot;, &quot;increasing pain&quot; or &quot;decreased range of motion or difficulty using the joint compared with baseline&quot;. Treated target joint bleeds: treated joint bleeds that occurred in a target joint, defined as a joint in which ≥3 treated joint bleeds occurred during the 24 weeks prior to study entry. Treated spontaneous bleeds: treated bleeds with no other known contributing factor such as trauma or procedure/surgery. For all types, bleeds due to surgery/procedure and bleeds occurring after dose up-titration were excluded.</description>

It consists of 46 items comprising 10 domains: physical health, treatment, work and school, dealing with hemophilia, feelings, familly planning, future, partnerships and sexuality, sports and leisure, and view of yourself. Items are rated by participants with one of five response options: never, seldom, sometimes, often, and always; although, for some items there is also a 'not applicable' option. The Total Score is based on the scores for each domain and ranges from 0 to 100, with lower scores reflective of better quality of life.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Participants With an Improvement From Baseline Greater Than the Responder Threshold for the Hemophilia Adult Quality of Life (Haem-A-QoL) Questionnaire Total Score at Specified Timepoints</title>
        <description>The Haem-A-QoL questionnaire was designed for adult participants (greater than or equal to 18 years old) with hemophilia. It consists of 46 items comprising 10 domains: physical health, treatment, work and school, dealing with hemophilia, feelings, familly planning, future, partnerships and sexuality, sports and leisure, and view of yourself. Items are rated by participants with one of five response options: never, seldom, sometimes, often, and always; although, for some items there is also a 'not applicable' option. The Total Score is based on the scores for each domain and ranges from 0 to 100, with lower scores reflective of better quality of life. An improvement larger than the responder threshold was defined as a decrease from baseline of at least 7 points in the Haem-A-QoL Total score.</description>

          <title>Change From Baseline in the Hemophilia Adult Quality of Life (Haem-A-QoL) Questionnaire Physical Health Domain Score at Specified Timepoints, Adult Participants</title>
          <description>The Haem-A-QoL questionnaire was designed for adult participants (greater than or equal to 18 years old) with hemophilia. It consists of 46 items comprising 10 domains: physical health, treatment, work and school, dealing with hemophilia, feelings, familly planning, future, partnerships and sexuality, sports and leisure, and view of yourself. Items are rated by participants with one of five response options: never, seldom, sometimes, often, and always; although, for some items there is also a 'not applicable' option. Scale scores for each domain range from 0 to 100, with lower scores reflective of better quality of life.</description>
          <population>The number analyzed represents the number of adult participants responding to the questionnaire who had a baseline value and a post-baseline value at a given timepoint.</population>

        <title>Percentage of Participants With an Improvement From Baseline Greater Than the Responder Threshold for the Hemophilia Adult Quality of Life (Haem-A-QoL) Questionnaire Physical Health Domain Score at Specified Timepoints</title>
        <description>The Haem-A-QoL questionnaire was designed for adult participants (greater than or equal to 18 years old) with hemophilia. It consists of 46 items comprising 10 domains: physical health, treatment, work and school, dealing with hemophilia, feelings, familly planning, future, partnerships and sexuality, sports and leisure, and view of yourself. Items are rated by participants with one of five response options: never, seldom, sometimes, often, and always; although, for some items there is also a 'not applicable' option. Scale scores for each domain range from 0 to 100, with lower scores reflective of better quality of life. An improvement larger than the responder threshold was defined as a decrease from baseline of at least 10 points in the Haem-A-QoL Physical Health domain score.</description>

        <description>The Haem-A-QoL questionnaire was designed for adult participants (greater than or equal to 18 years old) with hemophilia. It consists of 46 items comprising 10 domains: physical health, treatment, work and school, dealing with hemophilia, feelings, familly planning, future, partnerships and sexuality, sports and leisure, and view of yourself. Items are rated by participants with one of five response options: never, seldom, sometimes, often, and always; although, for some items there is also a 'not applicable' option. Scale scores for each domain range from 0 to 100, with lower scores reflective of better quality of life.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in the Hemophilia Adult Quality of Life (Haem-A-QoL) Questionnaire Future Domain Score at Specified Timepoints, Adult Participants</title>
        <description>The Haem-A-QoL questionnaire was designed for adult participants (greater than or equal to 18 years old) with hemophilia. It consists of 46 items comprising 10 domains: physical health, treatment, work and school, dealing with hemophilia, feelings, familly planning, future, partnerships and sexuality, sports and leisure, and view of yourself. Items are rated by participants with one of five response options: never, seldom, sometimes, often, and always; although, for some items there is also a 'not applicable' option. Scale scores for each domain range from 0 to 100, with lower scores reflective of better quality of life.</description>

        <population>The number analyzed represents the number of adult participants responding to the questionnaire who had a baseline value and a post-baseline value at a given timepoint.</population>

        <title>Change From Baseline in the Hemophilia Adult Quality of Life (Haem-A-QoL) Questionnaire Sports and Leisure Domain Score at Specified Timepoints, Adult Participants</title>
        <description>The Haem-A-QoL questionnaire was designed for adult participants (greater than or equal to 18 years old) with hemophilia. It consists of 46 items comprising 10 domains: physical health, treatment, work and school, dealing with hemophilia, feelings, familly planning, future, partnerships and sexuality, sports and leisure, and view of yourself. Items are rated by participants with one of five response options: never, seldom, sometimes, often, and always; although, for some items there is also a 'not applicable' option. Scale scores for each domain range from 0 to 100, with lower scores reflective of better quality of life.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in the Hemophilia Quality of Life Short Form (Haemo-QoL-SF) Questionnaire Total Score at Specified Timepoints, Adolescent Participants</title>
        <description>The Haemo-QoL-SF was designed as a series of age-related questionnaires to measure health-related quality of life in children and adolescents (12-17 year olds) with hemophilia. This version contains 35 items and covers nine domains considered relevant for children's health-related quality of life: physical health, treatment, sports and school, dealing with hemophilia, feelings, family, friends, other people, and view of yourself. Items are rated by participants with one of five response options: never, seldom, sometimes, often, and always. The Total Score is derived from the scores for all domains and scale scores range from 0 to 100, with a lower score reflective of better health-related quality of life.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Participants With an Improvement From Baseline Greater Than the Responder Threshold for the Hemophilia Quality of Life Short Form (Haemo-QoL-SF) Questionnaire Total Score at Specified Timepoints</title>
        <description>The Haemo-QoL-SF was designed as a series of age-related questionnaires to measure health-related quality of life in children and adolescents (12-17 year olds) with hemophilia. This version contains 35 items and covers nine domains considered relevant for children's health-related quality of life: physical health, treatment, sports and school, dealing with hemophilia, feelings, family, friends, other people, and view of yourself. Items are rated by participants with one of five response options: never, seldom, sometimes, often, and always. The Total Score is derived from the scores for all domains and scale scores range from 0 to 100, with a lower score reflective of better health-related quality of life. An improvement larger than the responder threshold was defined as a decrease of at least 5 points in the Haemo-QoL-SF Total score.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in the Hemophilia Quality of Life Short Form (Haemo-QoL-SF) Questionnaire Physical Health Domain Score at Specified Timepoints, Adolescent Participants</title>
        <description>The Haemo-QoL-SF was designed as a series of age-related questionnaires to measure health-related quality of life in children and adolescents (12-17 year olds) with hemophilia. This version contains 35 items and covers nine domains considered relevant for children's health-related quality of life: physical health, treatment, sports and school, dealing with hemophilia, feelings, family, friends, other people, and view of yourself. Items are rated by participants with one of five response options: never, seldom, sometimes, often, and always. Scale scores range from 0 to 100, with a lower score reflective of better health-related quality of life.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in the Hemophilia Quality of Life Short Form (Haemo-QoL-SF) Questionnaire Treatment Domain Score at Specified Timepoints, Adolescent Participants</title>
        <description>The Haemo-QoL-SF was designed as a series of age-related questionnaires to measure health-related quality of life in children and adolescents (12-17 year olds) with hemophilia. This version contains 35 items and covers nine domains considered relevant for children's health-related quality of life: physical health, treatment, sports and school, dealing with hemophilia, feelings, family, friends, other people, and view of yourself. Items are rated by participants with one of five response options: never, seldom, sometimes, often, and always. Scale scores range from 0 to 100, with a lower score reflective of better health-related quality of life.</description>
        <time_frame>Baseline (Week 1), 3, 6, 12, and 18 months, and at Early Termination or Study Completion (up to 24 months)</time_frame>
        <population>The number analyzed represents the number of adolescent participants responding to the questionnaire who had a baseline value and a post-baseline value at a given timepoint.</population>

This version contains 35 items and covers nine domains considered relevant for children's health-related quality of life: physical health, treatment, sports and school, dealing with hemophilia, feelings, family, friends, other people, and view of yourself. Items are rated by participants with one of five response options: never, seldom, sometimes, often, and always. Scale scores range from 0 to 100, with a lower score reflective of better health-related quality of life.</description>

          <description>The Haemo-QoL-SF was designed as a series of age-related questionnaires to measure health-related quality of life in children and adolescents (12-17 year olds) with hemophilia. This version contains 35 items and covers nine domains considered relevant for children's health-related quality of life: physical health, treatment, sports and school, dealing with hemophilia, feelings, family, friends, other people, and view of yourself. Items are rated by participants with one of five response options: never, seldom, sometimes, often, and always. Scale scores range from 0 to 100, with a lower score reflective of better health-related quality of life.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in the Hemophilia Quality of Life Short Form (Haemo-QoL-SF) Questionnaire View of Yourself Domain Score at Specified Timepoints, Adolescent Participants</title>
        <description>The Haemo-QoL-SF was designed as a series of age-related questionnaires to measure health-related quality of life in children and adolescents (12-17 year olds) with hemophilia. This version contains 35 items and covers nine domains considered relevant for children's health-related quality of life: physical health, treatment, sports and school, dealing with hemophilia, feelings, family, friends, other people, and view of yourself. Items are rated by participants with one of five response options: never, seldom, sometimes, often, and always. Scale scores range from 0 to 100, with a lower score reflective of better health-related quality of life.</description>

        <description>The EQ-5D-5L is a generic, self-reported, preference-based health utility measure that consists of six questions and is used to assess health status and inform pharmacoeconomic evaluations. The index utility score is based on the participant's assessment of their health on five scales: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression. It ranges from -0.224 to 1, with 0 corresponding to death and 1 corresponding to full health; negative values correspond to health states worse than death. Higher scores indicate better quality of life.</description>

        <description>The EQ-5D-5L is a generic, self-reported, preference-based health utility measure that consists of six questions and is used to assess health status and inform pharmacoeconomic evaluations. The visual analogue scale (VAS) ranges from 0 to 100 points, on which the participant self-assesses their current health status; 0 being the worst health you can imagine and 100 being the best health you can imagine. Higher scores are reflective of better health.</description>
