  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HoFH) is a rare hereditary disorder of lipoprotein&#xD;
      metabolism characterized by exceptionally high levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol&#xD;
      (LDL-C). Clinical manifestations may vary but often include markedly premature coronary&#xD;
      artery disease, supravalvular aortic stenosis due to aortic root atheroma, and cutaneous&#xD;
      manifestations such as tendon xanthomata. Although there are no universally ac-cepted&#xD;
      clinical diagnostic criteria for HoFH, an untreated serum LDL-C of &gt;13 mmol/L (500 mg/dL), or&#xD;
      an on-treatment LDL-C of more 8 mmol/L (300 mg/dL) together with the appearance of cutaneous&#xD;
      xanthomata before the age of 10 years, have often been used to diagnose HoFH clinically. As&#xD;
      molecular diagnostic techniques have advanced, genotyping of patients with severe&#xD;
      hypercholesterolemia has become an integral part of clinical practice in many settings. This&#xD;
      has led to the realization that the spectrum of clinical severity in HoFH is much wider than&#xD;
      initially thought and that the clinical criteria often fail to identify patients with milder&#xD;
      phenotypes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although the HoFH phenotype may result from mutations in multiple genes, low-density&#xD;
      lipoprotein receptor (LDL-R) dysfunction is the final common pathophysiological pathway&#xD;
      leading to LDL-C elevation in patients with HoFH and LDL-R mutations are by far the most&#xD;
      common genetic causes of HoFH. Patients with HoFH secondary to LDL-R mutations inherit a&#xD;
      mutated allele from each parent, resulting in severe functional impairment of the LDL-R&#xD;
      pathway. Residual LDL-R activity may vary considerably between mutations. Patients with HoFH&#xD;
      can be classified as receptor negative or receptor defective (&lt;2% or 2%-25% of residual&#xD;
      activity, respectively) based on LDL uptake studies in cultured fibroblasts, although&#xD;
      receptor function is nowadays often inferred after the identification of specific mutations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Historically, the prevalence of HoFH has been reported as 1 case per million. However,&#xD;
      emerging studies suggest that the prevalence of HeFH, and consequently HoFH, may be higher&#xD;
      than previously thought. Recent literature suggests an estimated prevalence of HeFH of ∼1&#xD;
      case in 2002 and of deleterious LDLR mutations in 0.45% of a control population and 1.9% of&#xD;
      individuals with early-onset myocardial infarction or coronary artery dis-ease.Extrapolating&#xD;
      from these data, the prevalence of HoFH is estimated to be ∼6 cases per million. Analysis of&#xD;
      a Dutch database of molecularly defined HoFH suggested a prevalence of ∼1 case per&#xD;
      160,000-300,000. Prevalence data are, however, continuing to evolve, and these calculations&#xD;
      could be underestimates or overestimates of the prevalence in the general patient population.&#xD;
      Information on the prevalence of FH in non-European populations is generally limited, and&#xD;
      conclusions about the possible worldwide prevalence remain speculative. However, as a result&#xD;
      of founder effects, the prevalence of HeFH and HoFH is higher in certain populations such as&#xD;
      the Afrikaners in South Africa, Christian Lebanese, and French Canadians.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The range of untreated and treated LDL-C levels in HoFH is wide. In two recent clinical&#xD;
      tri-als of novel therapies for HoFH, the LDL-C levels at study entry in conventionally&#xD;
      treated patients ranged from a mean of 8.7 ± 2.9 mmol/L (336 ± 112 mg/dL) to 11.4 ± 3.6&#xD;
      mmol/L (441 ± 139 mg/dL). Not all patients with HoFH have extreme LDL-C elevations. In a&#xD;
      study from the Netherlands, only 50% of patients with molecularly defined HoFH met the&#xD;
      clinical criterion of untreated LDL-C &gt;13 mmol/L (500 mg/dL), with some patients presenting&#xD;
      with untreated LDL-C levels as low as 4.4 mmol/L (170 mg/dL).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Reported LDL-C levels for clinical and genetic diagnoses of FH. Improved molecular diagnosis&#xD;
      has led to the understanding that a conventional diagnosis of HoFH encompasses a wide range&#xD;
      of underlying mutations with different effects on LDL-C levels, and highlights the need for&#xD;
      caution in interpreting historical LDL-C values. Furthermore, some patients with clinical FH&#xD;
      (10%-40%) lack an identified disease-causing mutation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A genetic diagnosis is highly desirable since the phenotype of severe hypercholesterolemia is&#xD;
      highly overlapping.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Actually 4 genes have been described being involved in the disease. The most common genetic&#xD;
      defects in FH are LDLR mutations (prevalence 1 in 500, depending on the population), ApoB&#xD;
      mutations (prevalence 1 in 1000), PCSK9 mutations (less than 1 in 2500) and LDLRAP1. The&#xD;
      related disease sitosterolemia, which has many similarities with FH and also features&#xD;
      cholesterol accumulation in tissues, is due to ABCG5 and ABCG8 mutations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      LDL receptor The LDL receptor gene is located on the short arm of chromosome 19&#xD;
      (19p13.1-13.3). It comprises 18 exons and spans 45 kb, and the protein gene product contains&#xD;
      839 amino acids in mature form. A single abnormal copy (heterozygote) of FH causes&#xD;
      cardiovascular disease by the age of 50 in about 40% of cases. Having two abnormal copies&#xD;
      (homozygote) causes accelerated atherosclerosis in childhood, including its complications.&#xD;
      The plasma LDL levels are inversely related to the activity of LDL receptor (LDLR).&#xD;
      Homozygotes have LDLR activity of less than 2%, while heterozygotes have defective LDL&#xD;
      pro-cessing with receptor activity being 2-25%, depending on the nature of the mutation. Over&#xD;
      1000 different mutations are known.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Apolipoprotein B Apolipoprotein B, in its ApoB100 form, is the main apolipoprotein, or&#xD;
      protein part of the lipoprotein particle. Its gene is located on the second chromosome&#xD;
      (2p24-p23) and is be-tween 21.08 and 21.12 Mb long. FH is often associated with the mutation&#xD;
      of R3500Q, which causes replacement of arginine by glutamine at position 3500. The mutation&#xD;
      is located on a part of the protein that normally binds with the LDL receptor, and binding is&#xD;
      reduced as a result of the mutation. Like LDLR, the number of abnormal copies determines the&#xD;
      severity of the hypercholesterolemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PCSK9 Mutations in the proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) gene were linked&#xD;
      to autosomal dominant (i.e. requiring only one abnormal copy) FH in a 2003 report. The gene&#xD;
      is located on the first chromosome (1p34.1-p32) and encodes a 666 amino acid protein that is&#xD;
      expressed in the liver. It has been suggested that PCSK9 causes FH mainly by reducing the&#xD;
      number of LDL receptors on liver cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      LDLRAP1 Abnormalities in the ARH gene, also known as LDLRAP1, were first reported in a family&#xD;
      in 1973. In contrast to the other causes, two abnormal copies of the gene are required for FH&#xD;
      to develop (autosomal recessive). The mutations in the protein tend to cause the production&#xD;
      of a shortened protein. Its real function is unclear, but it seems to play a role in the&#xD;
      relation between the LDL receptor and clathrin-coated pits. People with autosomal recessive&#xD;
      hypercholesterolemia tend to have more severe disease than LDLR-heterozygotes but less severe&#xD;
      than LDLR-homozygotes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      New methods, like mass-spectrometry give a good chance to characterize specific metabolic&#xD;
      alterations in the blood (plasma) of affected patients that allow diagnosing in the future&#xD;
      the disease earlier, with a higher sensitivity and specificity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore it is the goal of the study to identify and validate a new biochemical marker from&#xD;
      the blood of the affected patients helping to benefit other patients by an early diagnose and&#xD;
      thereby with an earlier treatment.&#xD;
