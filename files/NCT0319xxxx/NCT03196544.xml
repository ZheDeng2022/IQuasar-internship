  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall goal of this project is to develop a novel transdiagnostic behavioral treatment&#xD;
      -- social approach training -- intended to enhance positive social connections in individuals&#xD;
      with elevated anxiety and/or depression. Social relationship impairments are pervasive and&#xD;
      debilitating consequences of anxiety and depression. Existing treatments have some beneficial&#xD;
      impact on social functioning; however, many people continue to have few and/or poor quality&#xD;
      relationships following treatment, even after experiencing symptom relief. This study will&#xD;
      evaluate the effects of social approach training on the brain systems that have been shown to&#xD;
      be important for establishing positive connections with others. Approximately 60 individuals&#xD;
      (ages 18-55) seeking treatment for anxiety or depression will participate in this study.&#xD;
      Participants will be randomly assigned with equal probability to one of two versions of&#xD;
      social approach training (5 or 10 sessions) or a waitlist (assessment only) control group.&#xD;
      Participants will be assessed at baseline and post-treatment and compared on measures&#xD;
      assessing brain responses to social reward (primary outcome), as well as physiological,&#xD;
      behavioral, and emotional responses to social reward (secondary outcomes). It is hypothesized&#xD;
      that participants assigned to social approach training will display greater increases from&#xD;
      pre- to post-treatment in activity in brain systems that regulate the processing of social&#xD;
      reward (e.g., striatum) relative to participants in the control group. This study will also&#xD;
      determine whether the 5- vs. 10-session versions of the treatment program result in&#xD;
      meaningful differences, compared to each other, in how the brain responds to social reward.&#xD;
