      This is a single-center, open-label, single arm，exploratory clinical trial evaluating the&#xD;
      efficacy and safety of Apatinib in patients with local progressive/metastatic refractory&#xD;
      thyroid cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary endpoint is objective response rate(ORR),the secondary endpoints include&#xD;
      progression-free-survival(PFS)；disease control rate(DCR);serum Tg、TgAb、calcitonin；safety.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If any case happens as following,including withdrawing informed consent form(ICF)、unbearable&#xD;
      toxicity or adverse reactions、other conditions which investigators think the patients are&#xD;
      unsuitable to go on trail,the patient will not go on trial any longer,or every subject will&#xD;
      obtain study treatment until tumor progress with CT/MRI proof.The indicators of efficacy and&#xD;
      safety will be always observed during the trail process.&#xD;
