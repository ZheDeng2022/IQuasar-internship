&#xD;
      Part 1A (SAR439459 monotherapy)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and/or maximum administered dose (MAD) of&#xD;
           SAR439459 when administered intravenously as monotherapy in adult patients with advanced&#xD;
           solid tumors.&#xD;

&#xD;
        -  To determine the MTD and/or MAD of SAR439459 administered intravenously in combination&#xD;

&#xD;
        -  To determine optimal dose of SAR439459 administered intravenously in adult patients with&#xD;
           advanced melanoma who have failed a prior therapy based on anti-PD-1 (programmed cell&#xD;
           death-1) or anti-PD-L1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 2B (SAR439459 and cemiplimab combination therapy)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the objective response rate (ORR) of SAR439459 in combination with&#xD;

           antitumor response according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors 1.1 (RECIST&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The duration of the study for an individual patient will start from the signature of the main&#xD;
      informed consent and include a screening period of up to 4 weeks (28 days), a treatment&#xD;
      period of at least 1 or 2 cycles (21 or 14 days per cycle, respectively), an end-of-treatment&#xD;
      visit at least 30 days following the last administration of study drug (or until the patient&#xD;
      receives another anticancer therapy, whichever is earlier), and a follow-up visit 3 months&#xD;
      after treatment discontinuation and every 3 months following, until disease progression, or&#xD;
      initiation of another antitumor treatment, or death, whichever is earlier. For the urothelial&#xD;
      cancer cohort in Part 2B, follow-up visits will occur every 3 months until death, study&#xD;
      cut-off date, or upon cancellation of Survival follow-up at the discretion of the Sponsor at&#xD;
      any prior timepoint. For the overall survival analysis (approximately 12 months after last&#xD;
      patient first dose), whichever comes first.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who have no disease progression, and continue to benefit from the study drug(s),&#xD;
      will be allowed to continue treatment beyond the common study end-date at their assigned dose&#xD;
      unless the study is terminated by the Sponsor. The expected enrollment period is&#xD;
      approximately 42 months.&#xD;
