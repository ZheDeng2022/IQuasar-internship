  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pregnant women have increased morbidity and mortality due to infection with influenza.&#xD;
      Changes in T cell function have been proposed as possible mechanisms for this finding. We&#xD;
      believe that pregnancy induced changes in NK cell phenotype and function also impact&#xD;
      influenza immunity. This study will compare the immune response of pregnant women and&#xD;
      controls to TIV influenza vaccination as a surrogate for infection. In addition pregnant&#xD;
      women with flu like illness will be enrolled to evaluate changes in immune response following&#xD;
      influenza infection as compared to vaccination.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      We will enroll a cohort of 94 healthy pregnant women from the Lucille Packard Children's&#xD;
      Hospital Obstetrics Clinic from 2012-2017.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Women will be enrolled during their 2nd and 3rd trimesters, a time of high risk of&#xD;
      complications from influenza infection. All subjects will provide blood samples at day 0,&#xD;
      then be immunized with TIV as part of their regular medical care, and will return for&#xD;
      additional blood samples on approximately days 7 and 28.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In accordance with minimal risk guidelines in pregnant women, a total of 50 cc of blood will&#xD;
      be drawn across all three visits (20 cc, 20 cc, and 10 cc respectively).&#xD;
&#xD;
      An additional blood draw of 20 cc will be performed approximately 6 weeks postpartum to&#xD;
      coincide with the standard postpartum obstetrical follow up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a purely observational study. There is no treatment or randomization. Influenza&#xD;
      vaccination is the standard of care during pregnancy and will not be influenced by our study&#xD;
      design. All subjects will receive standard prenatal care, and will have access to maternal&#xD;
      fetal medicine experts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Volunteers for the flu like illness arm will be those who present to the Stanford Hospital&#xD;
      and Clinics with active flu-like symptoms. If the volunteer is interested in participating in&#xD;
      the study, Dr. Blish's staff will complete the consent process and continue with study&#xD;
      procedures. For hospitalized inpatients, the initial visit will be conducted onsite in the&#xD;
      hospital room. For patients seen at the outpatient clinics, the initial visit will be&#xD;
      conducted at the outpatient clinic or at the Clinical Translational Research Unit (CTRU)&#xD;
      using respiratory infection precaution procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Volunteers are encouraged to complete a second study visit. However, if returning for the&#xD;
      Visit 2 is a reason why a volunteer is unwilling to participate in the study, the volunteer&#xD;
      may complete only the first study visit and the follow-up phone call in order to enroll.&#xD;
      Volunteers will be encouraged to receive influenza vaccination (if they have not already done&#xD;
      so) through their primary care physician after the acute illness has subsided.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Visit 1 (Day 0) Enrollment/Baseline&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Potential participants will be provided with a verbal description of the study (purpose&#xD;
           and study schedule and procedures). They then will be asked if they have any questions&#xD;
           and allowed to read/sign the consent form. The consent form will be signed prior to the&#xD;
           performance of any study procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Review study eligibility criteria and collect an abbreviated medical history and current&#xD;
           concomitant medication use.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Obtain vital signs (oral temperature, blood pressure, pulse, and respiratory rate),&#xD;
           height and weight. Whenever possible, information will be obtained from existing clinic&#xD;
           or hospital records.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Record information about history of present illness.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Collect blood volume sample in 3 10 ml green top tubes (maximum volume not to exceed 30&#xD;
           mL).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Collect two nasopharyngeal flocked swab specimens(one specimen for the research&#xD;
           laboratory and one specimen for the clinical virology laboratory diagnosis if not&#xD;
           already collected by the hospital or the clinic staff).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Provide Memory Aid for volunteer to record course of illness, ILI resolution date and&#xD;
           serious adverse events occurring during the study period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 1A (phone call follow-up 7-10 days after Visit 1)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Study personnel will contact the volunteer to remind participant to record any changes&#xD;
           and course of their flu-like illness on the Memory Aid provided.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Subsequent study visit will be scheduled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 2 (Day 28 Â± 7 after Visit 1), PREFERRED, BUT OPTIONAL&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Review of medications and Memory Aid or new-onset medical conditions, influenza-like&#xD;
           illness and SAEs.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Obtain vital signs (oral temperature, blood pressure, pulse, and respiratory rate), and&#xD;
           weight&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Collect blood sample (maximum volume not to exceed 20 mL): in two 10 ml green top tubes&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Collect two nasopharyngeal flocked swab specimens (both swabs to be sent to research&#xD;
           laboratory).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Early Termination Visit:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If a volunteer is terminated from the study early, every effort should be made to perform the&#xD;
      following procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Review current health status and note any changes since the last visit. Solicit&#xD;
           information regarding SAEs and record all concomitant medications. Any ongoing related&#xD;
           SAEs will be followed to resolution or until a stable chronic condition has been&#xD;
           established. Volunteers will be encouraged to permit continued follow-up of SAEs if&#xD;
           necessary&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Obtain remaining blood samples, if possible.&#xD;
