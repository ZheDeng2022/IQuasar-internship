  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      As the general population ages and technology advances, many who suffer from catastrophic&#xD;
      critical illness (i.e. septic shock, respiratory failure, Acute Respiratory Disease Syndrome)&#xD;
      survive only to find themselves severely physically debilitated and compromised from a&#xD;
      pulmonary standpoint, requiring assistance from a mechanical ventilator in order to breath.&#xD;
      Oftentimes, these patients require a long course of physical rehabilitation and ventilator&#xD;
      support. These patients frequently remain ventilator dependent for greater than 3 weeks, and&#xD;
      are thus referred to as requiring prolonged mechanical ventilation (PMV).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Older patients are at significantly higher risk for requiring PMV for reasons that are not&#xD;
      entirely clear, but which may include physical deconditioning, impaired cardiopulmonary&#xD;
      physiology, and cognitive or behavioral disturbances.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is two fold: 1. to characterize the functional phenotype of&#xD;
      ventilator dependent, and recently ventilated patients with respect to general strength,&#xD;
      endurance, balance, and pulmonary functioning and body composition. 2. To pilot test a&#xD;
      rehabilitation protocol that targets improving this populations disabilities through&#xD;
      exercises focused on improving strength, endurance, balance, and pulmonary functioning.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Screening will occur daily, at which time the subject's medical history and current condition&#xD;
      will be reviewed. If they qualify informed consent will be obtained and the subject will&#xD;
      undergo baseline tests of function and health.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The subject will be asked to perform simple tasks for baseline testing purposes. These&#xD;
      include timed walking, lifting light weights or elastic exercise bands, assessment of&#xD;
      handgrip strength, getting up out of a chair, breathing into a machine to test lung function,&#xD;
      and answering questionnaires. The order of these tests may vary depending upon the subject's&#xD;
      schedule and availability of equipment. It may be necessary to repeat one or more of the&#xD;
      tests. Not all tests will be performed on everyone, depending upon one's strength, balance,&#xD;
      coordination and endurance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the completion of the baseline tests subjects will be randomized into one of two&#xD;
      groups. One group will receive a multimodal rehabilitation program (MRP) and usual care and&#xD;
      the other will receive usual care physical therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the subject is randomized to the intervention group, he/she will receive special MRP&#xD;
      sessions three times a week, for up to 8 weeks. Each session will last approximately one&#xD;
      hour, and will consist of limb strengthening exercises, endurance training, and&#xD;
      balance/coordination drills. These exercises and training maneuvers may involve the use of&#xD;
      handheld weights, nautilus weight equipment, elastic exercise bands, stationary exercise&#xD;
      machines (recumbent exercise cycles, hand ergometer cycles), or treadmills. All sessions will&#xD;
      be supervised by a licensed physical therapist, physical trainer, or certified instructor,&#xD;
      with a respiratory therapist present, if needed. Sessions will be conducted at the Pulmonary&#xD;
      Rehabilitation Gymnasium at the University of Maryland, Midtown Campus (MTC) or in the&#xD;
      subjects room at bedside.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the subject is not randomized to the group receiving the MRP, they will receive the&#xD;
      standard therapy program provided by MTC therapy services. To compliment the physical therapy&#xD;
      regimen, an optimized nutritional program will be administered according accepted guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the subject misses/does not complete a session the training period will be extended to&#xD;
      insure completion of the required number of sessions. If the subject is not randomized to the&#xD;
      group receiving the MRP, they will receive the standard therapy program provided by MTC&#xD;
      therapy services.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After two weeks of additional training, or 6 MRP sessions, the subjects will be re-evaluated&#xD;
      with repeat physical activity testing. The subject will be required to complete activities&#xD;
      similar to what they performed during your baseline evaluation. Retesting will be conducted&#xD;
      regardless of which training regimen the subject received (MRP vs. standard physical&#xD;
      therapy). Subjects will then train for an additional 2 weeks followed by repeat testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The each subject's participation in the study will be completed 1) after eight weeks of&#xD;
      physical therapy, 2) If the subject has been discharged from the Comprehensive Pulmonary&#xD;
      Rehabilitation Unit, or MTC, 3) if the subject gets transferred from MTC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All procedures will take place at MTC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exercises and maneuvers will include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Limb strengthening exercises: various exercises will be conducted, both as assessment&#xD;
           maneuvers, and as therapeutic purposes. These will include 1.lower extremity function&#xD;
           (get up and go, sit to stand, isometric leg press/extension) 2. upper extremity function&#xD;
           (modified military press, isometric triceps exercise, seated row, scapular depression).&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Isometric leg press/extension: Subjects will be asked to perform leg extension from&#xD;
                a seated position against a pad attached to a machine that offers resistance. This&#xD;
                resistance will be adjusted according to the force capability of each participant.&#xD;
                The leg press maneuver will also be performed from a seated position.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Modified military press: Subjects will be asked to perform this procedure from a&#xD;
                seated position. A machine offering resistance will be gripped at shoulder level.&#xD;
                The subject will be asked to extend their arms against the resistance to a straight&#xD;
                position and then slowly lower the load until they are back in the starting&#xD;
                position, with arms bent and hands at shoulder level.&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Isometric triceps exercise: From a seated position, a subject will be asked to hold&#xD;
                a dumbell in one hand straight over their head with their back straight. the weight&#xD;
                will be slowly lowered down behind the subjects neck in an arc with the elbow kept&#xD;
                stationary. The subject will then press the bar upwards but re-extending their arm,&#xD;
                thus completing the repetition upon full tricep extension.&#xD;
&#xD;
             4. Tricep Press Exercise (as tolerated): Using an overhead pulley machine a subject&#xD;
                will be asked to stand facing the machine holding the resistance bar in front of&#xD;
                them at chest level with arms in a flexed position, palms facing away from them.&#xD;
                The subject will then extend their arms in a downward motion, keeping the elbow&#xD;
                stationary, until their arms are fully extended at the subjects side with palms&#xD;
                facing backwards.&#xD;
&#xD;
             5. Chest press: (Using dumbells or press machine as tolerated) The subject will lie on&#xD;
                a bench or floor with a dumbbell in each hand, knees bent and your feet flat on the&#xD;
                surface. The dumbells will be positioned shoulder width (in the laying position,&#xD;
                directly above the shoulders) with arms and wrists straight and palms facing&#xD;
                towards the subjects feet. To start a the exercise, the subject will lower the&#xD;
                dumbells (or weight machine) towards their chest until the upper arms are at about&#xD;
                a 45 degree angle to the body. The weights should lowered to a level approximately&#xD;
                in line with the subjects chest. To complete the repetition, the subject is&#xD;
                required to straighten their arms, concentrating on using their chest muscles until&#xD;
                their arms are straight. The palms should face away from the patient, (or towards&#xD;
                the patients feet) throughout the entire motion.&#xD;
&#xD;
             6. Seated row: From a seated position, with their back and legs straight, the subject&#xD;
                will be required to grasp the handle of the seated row pulley system with arms&#xD;
                straight. Maintaining straight back and legs, the subject will pull the handle&#xD;
                towards them, at waist level. The subject should concentrate on using their back&#xD;
                muscles, rather than just their arms. Once the handle is pulled to the patients&#xD;
                waist, the subject will slowly allow the handle to return to the starting position&#xD;
                to complete the repetition.&#xD;
&#xD;
             7. Scapular depression: (as tolerated) From a seated position keeping their back&#xD;
                straight with arms and hands to each side, the subject will be asked to clasp the&#xD;
                seat of the chair and lift their bottom from the seat by straightening your elbows&#xD;
                and pushing the shoulders down. to complete the repetition, the subject will be&#xD;
                lower him or herself slowly back to the seated starting position.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The one repetition maximum (1 RM) will be measured on the same exercise equipment used&#xD;
           for strengthening exercises at baseline and after the ST program. The 1 RM test is&#xD;
           defined as the maximal resistance that can be moved through the full range of motion&#xD;
           with proper form one time. The 1 RM maneuver will be performed for each limb&#xD;
           strengthening exercise, and will be conducted and supervised by trained and licensed&#xD;
           physical therapists. Ratings of perceived effort and discomfort will be recorded&#xD;
           periodically throughout the test. The test will be immediately terminated if a high&#xD;
           discomfort rating is reached during the test, which is unrelated to normal&#xD;
           exertion-induced muscle fatigue.&#xD;
&#xD;
           One-on-one supervision by qualified physical therapists will be used for all training&#xD;
           sessions. These therapists will be able to demonstrate the proper technique and form for&#xD;
           all exercise maneuvers. These exercises have been successfully performed in protocols&#xD;
           completed by over 300 older men and women over the past several years, and are&#xD;
           well-tolerated by participants. The investigators anticipate that all subjects will not&#xD;
           be able to tolerate all tests, thus the testing regimen will be tailored to each&#xD;
           subjects tolerance.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. General strength (handgrip): The subject will be asked to perform this maneuver from a&#xD;
           seated position with their upper arm and forearm at a 90 degree angle. Handgrip strength&#xD;
           will be assess and recorded as the best of three attempts as measured on a dynamometer.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Maneuvers to assess pulmonary function, which include maximal expiratory pressure and&#xD;
           maximal inspiratory pressure. All pulmonary function maneuvers are performed routinely&#xD;
           at the USH pulmonary function laboratory by a trained respiratory therapist.&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Maximal Inspiratory Pressure (MIP) and Maximal Expiratory Pressure (MEP) are&#xD;
                measurements aid in the evaluating for respiratory muscle weakness. MIP is the&#xD;
                pressure generated during maximal inspiratory effort measured at the mouth. It is&#xD;
                usually measured from residual volume (RV) (end of expiration). Inspiratory muscle&#xD;
                strength is also inversely related to lung volume. Performing the maneuver requires&#xD;
                the subject to exhale to RV. With tight seal at mouth and nose, inspire (using&#xD;
                diaphragm) forcefully and sustain for 1-2 seconds.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. MEP is pressure generated during maximal expiratory effort measured at the mouth.&#xD;
                It is measured at total lung capacity (TLC), (full breath). Expiratory muscle&#xD;
                strength is directly related to lung volume. Performing the maneuver requires the&#xD;
                subject to inhale to TLC. With tight seal at mouth and nose, expire (using&#xD;
                diaphragm) forcefully and sustain for 1-2 seconds.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Six minute walk (Aerobic function): The subject will be asked to walk at their own pace&#xD;
           on a 30 meter course outlined in a corridor at USH. Their total distance walked after&#xD;
           six minutes will be recorded. During this test the patient will be continuously&#xD;
           monitored using pulse oximetry, heart rate monitoring and subjective visual scales of&#xD;
           dyspnea (borg index).&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Balance and Gait: The Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB) is a series of simple&#xD;
           tests requiring the subject to perform repeated standing and sitting from a chair, stand&#xD;
           in place with feet placed close to one another forming a narrow base, and to walk 4&#xD;
           meters. The SPPB has been well validated as a reproducible assessment of balance, gait&#xD;
           speed and lower extremity strength and endurance, and has been used by the investigators&#xD;
           in several studies without complication.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Skinfolds / Circumference measures: a tape measure will be used to measure the distance&#xD;
           around one or more locations on the subjects body (for example: upper arm, thigh, waist,&#xD;
           hips, chest). In addition, a skinfold caliper (measures skin thickness) will be used to&#xD;
           assess body fat by gently pinching the skin at the same locations on the subjects body.&#xD;
