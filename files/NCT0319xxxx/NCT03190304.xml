  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Studies with new drugs in the treatment of heart failure (HF), such as the combination of&#xD;
      valsartan/sacubitril, also known as LCZ696, have demonstrated important clinical impact on&#xD;
      the morbidity and mortality outcomes in HF population. However, the effect of LCZ696 on the&#xD;
      pathophysiological mechanisms of HF such as exercise tolerance (peak VO2) and peripheral&#xD;
      muscle blood flow is not known. Since LCZ696 is a new drug with promising effects on the&#xD;
      treatment of HF, the objective of the present study will be to evaluate the effect of LCZ696&#xD;
      in patients with HF on: 1) peak VO2, 2) 6-minute walk test, 3) peripheral muscle blood flow,&#xD;
      4) muscle strength, and 5) body composition.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Heart failure (HF) with reduced ventricular ejection fraction is a disease that affects&#xD;
      around 5.7 million people in the United States, with a mortality rate of approximately 50%&#xD;
      within 5 years. HF is characterized by an exacerbation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone&#xD;
      system (RAAS), which leads to an increase in sympathetic nerve outflow, peripheral&#xD;
      vasoconstriction, and reduced functional capacity. Moreover, many clinical trials have been&#xD;
      developed for the treatment of HF patients focused on inhibition of RAAS, such as enalapril.&#xD;
      Nevertheless, hospitalization and mortality rates in this population are excessive. However,&#xD;
      studies with new drugs, such as the combination of valsartan/sacubitril, also known as&#xD;
      LCZ696, have demonstrated important clinical impact on the morbidity and mortality outcomes&#xD;
      in HF population. However, the effect of LCZ696 on the pathophysiological mechanisms of HF&#xD;
      such as exercise tolerance (peak VO2) and peripheral muscle blood flow is not known. Since&#xD;
      LCZ696 is a new drug with promising effects on the treatment of HF, the objective of the&#xD;
      present study will be to evaluate the effect of LCZ696 in patients with HF on: 1) peak VO2,&#xD;
      2) 6-minute walk test, 3) peripheral muscle blood flow, 4) muscle strength, and 5) body&#xD;
      composition.&#xD;
