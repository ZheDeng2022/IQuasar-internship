    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, multicenter study in patients with metastatic breast cancer who are&#xD;
      candidates for standard first line treatment with palbociclib or ribociclib plus endocrine&#xD;
      therapy. To be eligible, patients must have received no prior chemotherapeutic or hormonal&#xD;
      regimen for metastatic disease. However, patients may still be considered eligible if they&#xD;
      have already started treatment with endocrine therapy (an aromatase inhibitor or fulvestrant)&#xD;
      plus palbociclib or ribociclib for no longer than 4 weeks prior to study enrollment, as long&#xD;
      as they meet all other eligibility criteria. Eligible patients must have had a diagnostic&#xD;
      biopsy of the metastatic lesion no more than 4 months prior to study enrollment and with&#xD;
      sufficient tissue to complete the proposed biomarker analysis. Patients who develop disease&#xD;
      progression within the first 12 months of starting palbociclib or ribociclib plus endocrine&#xD;
      therapy will be eligible for an optional additional tissue biopsy at time of disease&#xD;
      progression to repeat the analysis at time of disease progression and obtain real-time&#xD;
      (10-14-day turn-around) multi-omic data produced under College of American Pathologist&#xD;
      (CAP)/Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA) development and/or compliant&#xD;
      practices.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have histologically or cytologically proven diagnosis of adenocarcinoma&#xD;
             of the breast with evidence of locoregionally recurrent or metastatic disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Tumors must be estrogen and/or progesterone receptor positive according to ASCO/CAP&#xD;
             2010 guidelines as either ER or PR ≥ 1% positive nuclear staining by&#xD;
             immunohistochemistry based on local laboratory results.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Tumors must be HER2 negative as defined according to ASCO/CAP 2013, as HER2 0 - 1+ by&#xD;
             IHC or non-amplified FISH or CISH. If HER2 IHC is 2+, FISH/CISH must be performed and&#xD;
             must not be positive (HER2/CEP17 ratio must be &lt; 2, and HER2 copy number &lt; 6&#xD;
             signals/cell), but otherwise FISH/CISH is not required if IHC is 0 or 1+ by&#xD;
             institutional standards.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Must be candidates to receive endocrine therapy and palbociclib or ribociclib as&#xD;
             first-line treatment for their advanced disease. Patients will be considered eligible&#xD;
             for study enrollment if they have started on treatment with a standard dose and&#xD;
             schedule of palbociclib or ribociclib and endocrine therapy (aromatase inhibitor or&#xD;
             fulvestrant) as long as they have not started palbociclib or ribociclib treatment for&#xD;
             longer than 4 weeks from time of study enrollment, have sufficient tissue to perform&#xD;
             the proposed tissue analysis and must meet all other eligibility criteria. Endocrine&#xD;
             therapy can be initiated up to 4 weeks prior to starting palbociclib or ribociclib.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have measurable disease by RECIST v.1.1 or bone disease as their only&#xD;
             site of disease (with bone lesions confirmed by CT, MRI or bone X-ray).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  No prior treatment with chemotherapy for a diagnosis of locoregionally recurrent or&#xD;
             metastatic breast cancer is allowed.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Be ≥ 18 years of age&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have an ECOG score of 0-1&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Postmenopausal women defined as women with:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Prior bilateral surgical oophorectomy, or&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Medically confirmed post-menopausal status defined as spontaneous cessation of&#xD;
                  regular menses for at least 12 consecutive months or follicle-stimulating hormone&#xD;
                  (FSH), luteinizing hormone (LH) and estradiol blood levels in their respective&#xD;
                  postmenopausal ranges.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Premenopausal women will be considered eligible for study participation if they are&#xD;
             receiving medical ovarian suppression with luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone&#xD;
             (LHRH) agonists with documented estradiol blood levels in their respective&#xD;
             postmenopausal ranges.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Archive tumor tissue (obtained from a biopsy or surgical resection of a metastatic&#xD;
             lesion done within 4 months from study enrollment) availability is required for&#xD;
             patient participation. If the available tissue is insufficient for the required&#xD;
             baseline analysis, the patients are given the option to repeat the biopsy for the&#xD;
             purpose of study participation as long as they have not already started palbociclib or&#xD;
             ribociclib.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Understand and provide written informed consent prior to initiation of any&#xD;
             study-specific procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Lack of archive tumor tissue from a biopsy or surgical resection of a metastatic&#xD;
             lesion done within 4 months of study enrollment. Patients will be given an option to&#xD;
             have a repeated biopsy of a metastatic lesion if they had a diagnostic tumor biopsy&#xD;
             intended for use in the current study that was performed more than 4 months prior to&#xD;
             analysis, or there is insufficient tissue from the initial biopsy to complete the&#xD;
             analysis, as long as they have not started treatment with a CDK 4/6 inhibitor.&#xD;
             Otherwise, the patient will be excluded from the study participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have symptomatic CNS metastasis. Patients with a history of CNS metastases who have&#xD;
             been treated with whole brain irradiation must be stable without symptoms for 4 weeks&#xD;
             after completion of treatment, with image documentation required, and must be either&#xD;
             off steroids or on a stable does of steroids for ≥ 4 weeks prior to enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have uncontrolled concurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active&#xD;
             serious infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris,&#xD;
             unstable cardiac arrhythmias, psychiatric illness, or situations that would limit&#xD;
             compliance with the study requirements or ability to willingly give written informed&#xD;
             consent.&#xD;
