  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The First 1000 Days (conception to age 2) is a crucial period for the development and&#xD;
      prevention of obesity and its adverse consequences in mother-child pairs and their families.&#xD;
      The overall aim of the First 1000 Days program is to work across early-life systems to&#xD;
      prevent obesity, promote healthy routines and behaviors, address social determinants of&#xD;
      health, and reduce health disparities among vulnerable children and families at community&#xD;
      health centers in the Boston, MA area.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study aims to simultaneously implement and evaluate an obesity prevention program across&#xD;
      early life systems to reduce the prevalence of obesity risk factors within racial/ethnic&#xD;
      minority families, close the gap in maternal-child health disparities, and assess and address&#xD;
      social determinants of health.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>The First 1,000 Days program is a systems-level program that will reach all expectant mothers and families with 0-2 year olds receiving care at Boston-area community health centers. Mothers and infants at two similar non-intervention Boston-area health centers will be used as a comparison sample. Maternal and infant obesity-related clinical information is routinely recorded during patient visits in the EHR used at both the intervention and comparison sites. Sample size enrollment reflects maternal-infant dyads.</intervention_model_description>
