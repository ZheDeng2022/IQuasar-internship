  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multinational, open-label, ascending-dose, delayed-treatment concurrent control&#xD;
      clinical study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of AT132 in subjects with X-Linked&#xD;
      Myotubular Myopathy aged less than 5 years old. Subjects will receive a single dose of AT132&#xD;
      and will be followed for safety and efficacy for 5 years&#xD;

      This study will evaluate safety and efficacy of gene transfer in X-Linked Myotubular&#xD;
      Myopathy. Subjects will receive a single dose of AT132 delivered intravenously.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ASPIRO is being conducted in two parts. Part 1 is a dose escalation phase that is evaluating&#xD;
      the preliminary safety and efficacy of AT132 at doses of 1x1014 vg/kg and 3x1014 vg/kg. Part&#xD;
      2 of ASPIRO is a pivotal expansion cohort designed to confirm the safety and efficacy of&#xD;
      AT132 at a dose of 3x1014 vg/kg. The pivotal expansion cohort will enroll eight subjects,&#xD;
      consisting of four age-matched pairs (within +/- 6 months of age). One subject from each pair&#xD;
      will be randomized to receive a single dose of AT132 at 3x1014 vg/kg, and the other will&#xD;
      serve as a delayed treatment control. Eligible delayed treatment control subjects will be&#xD;
      administered AT132 after that individual subject has completed the Week 24 visit as a delayed&#xD;
      treatment control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary efficacy endpoint measures will be assessed at Week 24. Subjects will be followed&#xD;
      for a total of 5 years after administration of AT132.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study utilizes an independent Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) that will monitors subject&#xD;
      safety and provides recommendations to Audentes regarding dose escalation, dose expansion,&#xD;
      and safety matters.&#xD;
