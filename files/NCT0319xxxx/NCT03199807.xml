  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the fifth most common cancer and the third leading cause of&#xD;
      cancer-related death worldwide. The resection rate for HCC is approximately 10%-30% and the&#xD;
      overall prognosis is very poor with a 5-year survival rate of 5%-6%. The recurrence rate is&#xD;
      high after radical resection. In addition to surgery, radiofrequency ablation, transcatheter&#xD;
      arterial chemoembolization (TACE), microwave ablation, cryoablation, radioactive seeds&#xD;
      implantation, high-intensity-focused ultrasound, radiation therapy, chemotherapy and targeted&#xD;
      drugs are available for patients with unresectable tumors; however, the efficacy of these&#xD;
      treatments are limited and long-term prognosis in the patients is still poor. Moreover, due&#xD;
      to serious side effects induced by treatments such as TACE, chemotherapy and targeted drugs,&#xD;
      it may not be possible for patients to continue receiving these therapies. The study herein&#xD;
      successfully developed a new immunotherapeutic approach combined with radiotherapy, and tried&#xD;
      to proved it to be more effective and safe.&#xD;
