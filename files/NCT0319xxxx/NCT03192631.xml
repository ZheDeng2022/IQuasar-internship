    <textblock>
      There is a lack of incentive approach for patients who suffer from schizophrenia yet lack the&#xD;
      insight to accept treatment. Most existing approaches involve coercion and involuntary&#xD;
      hospitalizations. This study will explore whether patients with poor insight and lacking in&#xD;
      competence for treatment decisions will improve their acceptance and adherence of depot&#xD;
      injection antipsychotic medication if a financial incentive is offered. Ethical&#xD;
      considerations are also explored for this innovative pilot study&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Background: Medication adherence in patients with schizophrenia is a major challenge. For&#xD;
      those who do come into contact with treatment services, various clinical and psychosocial&#xD;
      approaches to improve antipsychotic medication adherence have been studied but none is very&#xD;
      successful. People with severe psychotic illness often have poor insight into their illness,&#xD;
      and lack competence for treatment decisions, making them very vulnerable to frequent illness&#xD;
      relapses due to inadequate or lack of treatment. Furthermore, to compel them to receive&#xD;
      treatment out of concerns for their own and others' safety and welfare, they are often&#xD;
      subjected to involuntary hospitalization and community based treatments, by means such as&#xD;
      Community Treatment Orders (CTO). Under the authority of CTO, patients need to take&#xD;
      medication or they will be forcefully brought to the hospital for assessment and or&#xD;
      hospitalization. There is concern for the coercive nature of these means that may harm these&#xD;
      patients' relationship to the psychiatric system, and overall quality of life. There is well&#xD;
      found concern for potential violation of the ethical principle of &quot;do no harm&quot;, particularly&#xD;
      when less coercive, easy to understand alternatives - such as financial incentives to take&#xD;
      medication - have not been well explored. This study aims to assess financial incentive as a&#xD;
      promoter of medication adherence in the most medication resistant patient population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: In a randomized cross-over study, the investogators will study medication adherence&#xD;
      by focusing exclusively on a form of medication that is accurately measureable - the&#xD;
      long-acting injectable antipsychotic medication. Participants will be recruited from the 160&#xD;
      patients who are currently enrolled at the St. Michael Hospital's Assertive Community&#xD;
      Treatment team (FOCUS). Any patient who has had less than 75% adherence rate of his/her&#xD;
      injectable antipsychotic depot medication in the last 4 months will be recruited. There are&#xD;
      estimated 20-30 patients who would meet the inclusion criteria. Ten patients will be randomly&#xD;
      assigned to each arm of the cross-over study. The treatment A arm would be offered the&#xD;
      intervention of a $15 incentive to take the injectable medication. The treatment B arm would&#xD;
      be treatment as usual as per FOCUS services. Each phase of the cross-over study would last 9&#xD;
      months - i.e. the cross-over would take place after 9 months. The primary outcome will be&#xD;
      depot medication adherence levels, comparing the adherence rates in the treatment as usual&#xD;
      phase. The secondary outcomes will be global clinical improvement, number of voluntary and&#xD;
      involuntary hospital admissions and Emergency Room visits, number of police and justice&#xD;
      system encounters, number of attempted and completed suicides, incidents of physical&#xD;
      violence, number of days spent in work/education/rehabilitation programs, subjective quality&#xD;
      of life and satisfaction with medication. The investigators will also study the cost&#xD;
      effectiveness of offering financial incentives.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Discussion: The pilot study aims to provide new evidence on the effectiveness and cost&#xD;
      effectiveness of offering financial incentives as an alternative to existing coercive&#xD;
      approaches to improving medication adherence for patients with severe psychotic disorders. If&#xD;
      found effective, and the benefits outweigh the risks, the potential to expand the practice,&#xD;
      under strict ethical considerations and monitoring, at a larger policy and as an optional,&#xD;
      available service improvement tool, is anticipated to be large. This will be the first known&#xD;
      Canadian study on the subject.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The inclusion criteria are the following: 1) an established psychiatric diagnosis of&#xD;
             schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, or bipolar disorder according to DSM-V; 2)&#xD;
             part of the FOCUS team for at least 4 months; 3) between 18 and 65 years of age; 4)&#xD;

             defined period of last 4 months (some patients may eventually accept depot after&#xD;
             repeated efforts by clinicians, but the 4-month timeframe allows precise calculation&#xD;
             of their adherence rate); and 7) team consensus on history of failure of other general&#xD;
             methods available to the team to ensure adherence to medication (e.g. repeated&#xD;
             psychoeducation, case meetings, family persuasion, offering of at-home depot&#xD;
             administration, etc.); and 8) established incapacity for treatment decision.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Exclusion criteria are: 1) established learning disorder; 2) inability to give&#xD;
