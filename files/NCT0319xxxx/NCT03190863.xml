  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Motor imagery has shown promising results to optimize tenodesis grasp in individuals with&#xD;
      C6-C7 tetraplegia. However, efficacy of using motor imagery to improve grasping after&#xD;
      tetraplegia requires further study with higher level of evidence. In addition, controlling&#xD;
      covert practice remains difficult due to the absence of overt movements. However, similar&#xD;
      brain activity measured during both over and cover movements makes possible to provide visual&#xD;
      information about the covert practice performance using neurofeedback.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Investigators thus designed this multicentric randomized controlled trial to investigate&#xD;
      the effect of motor imagery with or with no visual neurofeedback on grasping capabilities&#xD;
      after C6-C7 tetraplegia. They hypothesized that providing neurofeedback based on brain&#xD;
      activity measured by electroencephalography namely knowing the covert practice performance&#xD;
      would results in greater grasping improvement in response to practice as compared to motor&#xD;
      imagery practice alone.&#xD;

    <measure>Wrist extension angle in degree during grasping with 3D motion analysis system</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 19 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Individuals with C6-C7 tetraplegia extend their wrist to grasp using tenodesis. Specifically, the wrist extension shortens the tendons of fingers and thumbs flexors that elicit either a palmar or a lateral grip. A complete reach-to-grasp movement will be recorded using a 3D motion analysis system (Vicon Motion Systems Ltd. UK). Wrist extension angle in degree will be measure during grasping when the object is grasped.</description>
