    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well obinutuzumab and ibrutinib work as front line therapy in&#xD;
      treating patients with indolent non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Monoclonal antibodies, such as&#xD;
      obinutuzumab, may interfere with the ability of cancer cells to grow and spread. Ibrutinib&#xD;
      may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth.&#xD;
      Giving obinutuzumab and ibrutinib may work better in treating patients with non-Hodgkin's&#xD;
      lymphomas.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To assess the efficacy of the combination of ibrutinib and obinutuzumab in chemotherapy&#xD;
      naive patients with indolent lymphomas.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To assess progression free survival rates and overall survival rates in indolent&#xD;
      lymphomas.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To assess safety and tolerability of the combination. III. To evaluate response using&#xD;
      positron emission tomography (PET) and correlate PET negativity with durability of response.&#xD;

    <description>Patients receive ibrutinib orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-28. Cycles repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients also receive obinutuzumab intravenously (IV) on days 1, 8, and 15 of cycle 1 and day 1 of subsequent cycles. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 6 cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Beginning 2 months after cycle 6, patients with stable disease will continue to receive obinutuzumab every 2 months for a total of 12 doses.&#xD;
After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up monthly for 1 year, every 3-6 months for 4 years, and then annually for up to 2 years.</description>
