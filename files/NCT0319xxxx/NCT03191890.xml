  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to generate a comprehensive survey of the use on the market of the&#xD;
      Anecova device within its intended indications according to the Instructions For Use. The&#xD;
      Anecova Registry is part of the Anecova quality system, to enable the Post Marketing&#xD;
      Surveillance and the Post Market Clinical Follow-up.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      As soon as the very first minute of the fertilization process, very important biological&#xD;
      events, critical for the future developmental competency of the embryo are taking place.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These biological events, after the sperm cell entry in the oocyte cytoplasm and prior to the&#xD;
      first cleavage, include: the completion of the meiosis, the exclusion of the second polar&#xD;
      body, the pronuclei formation, the replication of the male and female DNA and the chromosome&#xD;
      segregation on the newly formed mitotic spindle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If any of these events is aberrant, one or both of the two daughter cells and their&#xD;
      descendants may carry chromosomal anomalies. In other words an uneven first cleavage in size&#xD;
      or in content is associated with chromosomal abnormality and aneuploidy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In vivo all these events occur in a natural environment where the presence of specific&#xD;
      molecules and of a dynamic and physiological environment might be an advantage over in vitro&#xD;
      culture conditions to ensure optimal cellular functions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Registry will capture information from the Anecova procedure, from the outcomes, from the&#xD;
      procedure performance, from the safety and from the utilization of the Anecova Medical Device&#xD;
      in clinical routine.&#xD;
