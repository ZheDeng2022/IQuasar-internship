  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to design a prospective randomized clinical trial to explore&#xD;
      whether postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy may provide survival benefit for stage II colon&#xD;
      cancer patients with high risk factors.Therefore the investigators can provide high level&#xD;
      clinical evidence of indications for patients with colon cancer with stage II colon cancer.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The most controversial of adjuvant chemotherapy for colon cancer is whether stage II colon&#xD;
      cancer should receive adjuvant chemotherapy or not. Because of the absolute little benefit of&#xD;
      adjuvant chemotherapy after curative resection of stage II colon cancer，NCCN and ESMO&#xD;
      guidelines do not recommend routine adjuvant chemotherapy for patients with stage II colon&#xD;
      cancer unless combined with high risk factors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently，most studies about stage II colon cancer with high risk factors were retrospective.&#xD;
      Some suggested that patients with stage II colon cancer can benefit from adjuvant&#xD;
      chemotherapy, however, more got the negative conclusions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study was designed as a multicenter, prospective, randomized, controlled trial.Patients&#xD;
      who agreed to participate in the study would be randomly assigned to a treatment group of&#xD;
      adjuvant chemotherapy or observation with 50% chance by a central randomization system&#xD;
      determined by the computer program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After a follow up of at least 3 years, the disease free survival of the two groups will be&#xD;
      compared.&#xD;
