      I. INTRODUCTION Bioabsorbable drug-eluting scaffolds (&quot;BVS&quot;) have emerged as a potential&#xD;
      major breakthrough for treatment of coronary artery lesions providing a possibility to&#xD;
      overcome the long term limitations of conventional stent implantation which precludes future&#xD;
      surgical revascularization, eliminates reactive vasomotion, impairs noninvasive imaging and&#xD;
      exposes patients to the risk of very late stent thrombosis. BVS have been extensively studied&#xD;
      in clinical trials. Treatment of noncomplex obstructive coronary artery disease with BVS was&#xD;
      within the prespecified margin for noninferiority compared to Xience stent with respect to&#xD;
      target lesion failure at 1 year in the latest large-scale randomized trial (ABRORB III).&#xD;
      Although the concept of self-degrading stent is attractive and the results from clinical&#xD;
      trials have been promising, there is a paucity of data regarding the use of BVS in &quot;real&#xD;
      world&quot; patients undergoing percutaneous intervention (&quot;PCI&quot;). The outcomes from a large BVS&#xD;
      registry of patients with relatively unselected clinical characteristics and lesions were&#xD;
      comparable to those reported for the second generation drug eluting stents (&quot;DES&quot;), however,&#xD;
      the scaffold thrombosis rate in the first 30 days after implantation resembled that of the&#xD;
      first generation DES suggesting that the lesion selection and procedure optimization require&#xD;
      further improvement. BVS development has required new imaging modalities, assessment&#xD;
      methodologies, and treatment strategies because their design, degradation rate, coating,&#xD;
      changes in mechanical properties may affect safety and efficacy of the device. Due to its&#xD;
      high resolution, Optical Coherence Tomography (&quot;OCT&quot;) imaging has played a central role in&#xD;
      understanding the short and long term performance of bioresorbable scaffolds.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. STUDY AIM To evaluate the acute and long term outcomes of BVS implantation in consecutive&#xD;
      coronary artery disease (&quot;CAD&quot;) patients using OCT imaging.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. STUDY POPULATION Fifty (50) consecutive patients who underwent PCI with BVS implantation&#xD;
      and OCT imaging for treatment of CAD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. STUDY DESIGN This is a single center retrospective analysis of data collected under the&#xD;
      EXEMPT database (GCO# 02-0178) at the Cardiac Catheterization Laboratory at Mt. Sinai&#xD;
      Hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. STUDY PROCEDURES Patients with stable CAD who underwent PCI with BVS implantation. Lesions&#xD;
      were treated with pre-dilatation using conventional semicompliant or non-compliant balloon.&#xD;
      The use of additional devices, cutting balloons or rotablator, were performed at the&#xD;
      operator's discretion. The operator made the decision on BVS length and size. First OCT&#xD;
      pullback (OCT-PRE) was performed before BVS implantation to analyze lesion stenosis,&#xD;
      references, and plaque morphology including the extent and location of calcification. In&#xD;
      addition, online co-registration of OCT with coronary angiogram was performed to confirm the&#xD;
      correct spatial orientation of OCT findings. The second OCT pullback (OCT - POST) was&#xD;
      performed after BVS implantation followed by post-dilatation (20 atm). Angio-OCT&#xD;
      co-registration was used to assess acute post-procedural results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VI. STUDY OUTCOMES&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Acute lumen gain after BVS implantation by quantitative coronary angiography (&quot;QCA&quot;) and&#xD;
           OCT; effect of coronary calcification on lumen gain, BVS apposition and expansion.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Review of the clinical follow up data which was collected at 1 month and 12 months after&#xD;
           the procedure&#xD;
&#xD;
      VII. IMAGE ANALYSIS&#xD;
&#xD;
      QCA analysis. In each patient, the treated segment (in-scaffold) and the peri-scaffold&#xD;
      segment (defined as 5 mm proximal and distal to the scaffold edge) will be analyzed by QCA in&#xD;
      paired matched angiographic views before and after procedure using metallic markers at the&#xD;
      proximal and distal ends of the device. Minimal lumen diameter (MLD), reference vessel&#xD;
      diameter, percentage of area stenosis, and lesion length will be measured by two experienced&#xD;
      analysts using dedicated software (QCA-QAngioXA 7.3; Medis) as previously described. Acute&#xD;
      lumenal gain will be defined as the difference between MLD immediately after procedure and&#xD;
      MLD before BVS implantation. In addition, the presence of angiographic calcification will be&#xD;
      assessed. Calcification will be identified by angiography as readily apparent radiopacities&#xD;
      within the vascular wall at the site of stenosis and will be classified as none/mild or&#xD;
      moderate (radiopacities noted only during the cardiac cycle before contrast injection)/severe&#xD;
      (radiopacities visible without cardiac motion before contrast injection usually compromising&#xD;
      both sides of the lumen).&#xD;
&#xD;
      OCT lesion analysis will be performed offline at 1-mm interval according to previously&#xD;
      validated criteria and as we previously described. The minimal and reference lumen diameter&#xD;
      and area will be measured to calculate percent lumen area stenosis. Plaques will be&#xD;
      classified as fibrous, lipid, or calcified. For each lipid plaque, the maximal lipid arc will&#xD;
      be measured at 1-mm interval and the minimal thickness of the fibrous cap will be assessed.&#xD;
      The degree of circumferential extent of calcification will be quantified at 1 mm interval by&#xD;
      measuring the maximal calcification arc.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OCT analysis of BVS will be performed at 1-mm interval within the entire stented segment and&#xD;
      at 5 mm proximal and distal to the BVS edge. For each cross section analyzed, the area, mean,&#xD;
      minimal and maximal diameters of the BVS will be measured automatically with manual&#xD;
      corrections if appropriate. The proximal and distal reference vessel area (RVA) will be&#xD;
      calculated as the mean of the largest two lumenal areas 5 mm distal and proximal to the BVS&#xD;
      edge. Acute strut fracture will be suspected if isolated struts are detected lying unopposed&#xD;
      in the lumen with no connection to other surrounding stent struts. 3D OCT reconstruction with&#xD;
      QAngio OCT RE software (Medis) will be performed to confirm the diagnosis. Incomplete strut&#xD;
      apposition (ISA) will be defined as the presence of struts separated from the underlying&#xD;
      vessel wall. The percentage of ISA will be calculated as a ratio of malapposed struts number&#xD;
      to the total number of struts observed at 1-mm interval. Since abluminal border of the struts&#xD;
      can be visualized in BVS, we will assess the ISA area for each frame with malapposed struts.&#xD;
      The percentage of Residual Area Stenosis (RAS) will be calculated as: [(1 - (minimal lumen&#xD;
      area/RVA))] ×50 ; the eccentricity index as the ratio between the minimal and the maximal&#xD;
      diameter. The symmetry index will be defined as (maximal stent diameter - minimal stent&#xD;
      diameter)/(maximal stent diameter). OCT analysis will be performed in Mount Sinai Cath Lab&#xD;
      Core imaging laboratory.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VIII. PROPENSITY-MATCHED COMPARISON BETWEEN BVS AND DES A retrospective analysis will be&#xD;
      performed on 50 study patients who underwent PCI with BVS and consecutive patients who&#xD;
      underwent DES implantation in Mount Sinai catheterization laboratory with the comparator&#xD;
      sample size of 50. The DES patients will be selected from the Mount Sinai imaging database.&#xD;
      Propensity score matching will be performed to reduce the effect of confounding factors in&#xD;
      the retrospective study for two groups of patients with different recruitment periods.&#xD;
      Multiple logistic regression analysis will include the following variables as covariates:&#xD;
      previous MI, previous CABG, CAD family history, history of smoking, dyslipidemia, diabetes&#xD;
      mellitus, use of atherectomy device, stent/BVS post-dilatation, stent/BVS diameter and&#xD;
      length, maximal calcium arc by OCT and total number of treated vessels.&#xD;
