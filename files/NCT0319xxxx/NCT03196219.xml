    <textblock>
      An open-label and single-blind phase 2 study to evaluate the oral microbiology, safety and&#xD;
      tolerability of multiple C16G2 Varnish and Strip applications in male and female dental&#xD;
      subjects 12-75 years of age. The study will compare multiple study drug administrations of&#xD;
      C16G2 Varnish and/or C16G2 Strip in three study arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Study Arm 1 eight subjects will be enrolled in an open-label manner and will receive a&#xD;
      daily dose of C16G2 Varnish application over 3 days followed by 14 doses of C16G2 Strip&#xD;
      administered over 7 days. Following the three C16G2 Varnish applications, each subject will&#xD;
      receive 7 days of AM and PM dosing with C16G2 Strip and will be followed for microbiology for&#xD;
      up to 2 months after the last study drug administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Arm 2 will enroll 12 subjects in a single-blind manner. Subjects will receive four&#xD;
      C16G2 Varnish or Placebo applications over 7 days, followed by 3 additional weekly varnish&#xD;
      administrations. Subjects will be followed for microbiology for up to 2 months after the last&#xD;
      study drug administration.The treatment allocation will be 1:1 (6 subjects receiving C16G2&#xD;
      Varnish, 6 subjects receiving Placebo).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Arm 3 will be initiated based on the Sponsor's review of all microbiology data up to&#xD;
      two week post last study drug administration from Study Arm 2. If initiated, Study Arm 3 will&#xD;
      enroll 6 subjects in an open-label manner. Subjects will receive daily single doses of C16G2&#xD;
      Varnish over 10 days, for a total of 10 doses and will be followed for microbiology for up to&#xD;
      2 months after the last study drug administration.&#xD;

      An open-label and single-blind phase 2 study to evaluate the oral microbiology, safety and&#xD;
      tolerability of multiple C16G2 Varnish and Strip applications in male and female dental&#xD;
      subjects 12-75 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will compare multiple study drug administrations of 13.6 milligrams (mg) of C16G2&#xD;
      Varnish and 9.2 mg of C16G2 Strip in three study arms. Before dosing of study drug, eligible&#xD;
      subjects will receive professional dental prophylaxis between Days -7 and -2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Study Arm 1 eight subjects will be enrolled in an open-label manner and will receive a&#xD;
      daily dose of C16G2 Varnish application over 3 days followed by 14 doses of C16G2 Strip&#xD;
      administered over 7 days. C16G2 Varnish will be applied with a small brush typically used in&#xD;
      dental varnish administration. Following the three C16G2 Varnish applications, each subject&#xD;
      will receive 7 days of AM and PM dosing with C16G2 Strip. To evaluate the durability of S.&#xD;
      mutans suppression, study subjects will be followed for microbiology for up to 2 months after&#xD;
      the last study drug administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Arm 2 will enroll 12 subjects in a single-blind manner. Subjects will receive four&#xD;
      C16G2 Varnish or Placebo applications over 7 days (Days 0, 2, 5 &amp; 7), followed by 3&#xD;
      additional weekly varnish administrations. The treatment allocation will be 1:1 (6 subjects&#xD;
      receiving C16G2 Varnish, 6 subjects receiving Placebo). To evaluate the durability of S.&#xD;
      mutans suppression, study subjects will be followed for microbiology for up to 2 months after&#xD;
      the last study drug administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Arm 3 will be initiated based on the Sponsor's review of all microbiology data up to&#xD;
      two week post last study drug administration from Study Arm 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If initiated, Study Arm 3 will enroll 6 subjects in an open-label manner. Subjects will&#xD;
      receive daily single doses of C16G2 Varnish over 10 days, for a total of 10 doses. To&#xD;
      evaluate the durability of S. mutans suppression, study subjects will be followed for&#xD;
      microbiology for up to 2 months after the last study drug administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinic visits in Study Arm 1 include Visit 1 (Screening/Days -30 to -1), Visit 2&#xD;
      (Prophylaxis/Day -7 to -2), Eligibility Confirmation, Baseline &amp; First C16G2 Varnish Dosing&#xD;
