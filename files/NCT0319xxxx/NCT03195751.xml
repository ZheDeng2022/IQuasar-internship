  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The scope of the research is to determine if a motion-based software development kit may&#xD;
      substitute for a manual goniometer. If so, this opens up the possibility of remote&#xD;
      telemonitoring of upper extremities patients.&#xD;

      The Capture mobile application or &quot;app&quot; (FocusMotion, Santa Monica, California) was custom&#xD;
      designed and securely installed on a single (CCF) smartphone used by the Lead&#xD;
      Co-Investigator, Dr. Ramkumar, and serves as a private user interface for the proprietary&#xD;
      software development kit (SDK). The Capture app uses a Bluetooth connection to pair with the&#xD;
      Pebble Time Round smartwatch to allow for remote timekeeping of the smartphone while in use&#xD;
      by the participant. The smartwatch was loaned by FocusMotion to the investigators for the&#xD;
      purpose of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This proprietary SDK (FocusMotion) processes user motions recorded by the hardware&#xD;
      (accelerometer, gyroscope, magnometer). As data is collected, the software development kit&#xD;
      (SDK) classifies the motion as repetitive or non-repetitive, and repetitive motions are&#xD;
      further analyzed. As the user completes a workout or movement, the SDK tracks the number of&#xD;
      repetitions performed, technique, and rest time. The SDK can provide real-time feedback to&#xD;
      the user regarding their form by comparing the movement to a template of an ideal motion for&#xD;
      that particular action. The SDK is compatible with any operating system, phone, or wearable&#xD;
      device, providing seamless integration with pre-existing technologies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measurements from the SDK will be compared to those taken with a manual goniometer for four&#xD;
      shoulder maneuvers (abduction, forward flexion, internal rotation, external rotation). Each&#xD;
      of the 10 subjects will perform 5 trials of each maneuver for consistency and&#xD;
      reproducibility.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants without shoulder pain, with full shoulder range of motion and without prior&#xD;
      shoulder surgery will be recruited. No other exclusion criteria will be instituted.&#xD;
      Individuals will be recruited from CCF undergraduate and graduate medical education programs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis will be employed to assess the shoulder motion arcs measured from both&#xD;
      the SDK and the manual goniometer. Univariate analyses (chi-square for categorical and t-test&#xD;
      for continuous variables) will be performed to compare the angle measurements from each&#xD;
      patient and angle measurement. Power analysis indicated a 94% chance of detecting a large&#xD;
      effect size and a 60% chance of detecting a medium effect size between the two groups at the&#xD;
      5% confidence level. For 1 sample t-tests, power analysis indicated that there was a 92%&#xD;
      chance of detecting a medium effect size significant at the 5% confidence level. All data&#xD;
      analysis will be performed using Microsoft. Excel analytics software version 14.5.4 A p-value&#xD;
      cutoff of &lt;0.05 was used to determine statistical significance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All adverse events will be reported to the Institutional Review Board.&#xD;
