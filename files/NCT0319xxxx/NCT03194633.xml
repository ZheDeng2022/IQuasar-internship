  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic kidney disease (CKD) and hypertension are two closely related common chronic diseases&#xD;
      that have serious implications to human health. Hypertension is a major cause for progression&#xD;
      of renal disease and a risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD). Control of Blood&#xD;
      Pressure (BP) to target is now considered to be the main goal in the treatment of patients&#xD;
      with CKD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In clinical practice, it is difficult for CKD patients with hypertension to achieve systolic&#xD;
      BP (SBP) or diastolic BP (DBP) goal; oftentimes, calcium channel blocker (CCB) class of&#xD;
      drugs, for example, nifedipine gastrointestinal therapeutic system (GITS), is used in such&#xD;
      patients. Previous data have demonstrated nifedipine to be having a significant dose-response&#xD;
      relationship; that is, nifedipine 60 mg provided better BP reduction than 30 mg. However,&#xD;
      there are limited studies that have evaluated the efficacy and tolerability of nifedipine&#xD;
      GITS 60 mg in Chinese CKD patients with hypertension. Hereby, the objective of this study was&#xD;
      to evaluate the effectiveness and tolerability of nifedipine GITS 60 mg treatment in a large&#xD;
      cohort of CKD patients with uncontrolled hypertension.&#xD;
