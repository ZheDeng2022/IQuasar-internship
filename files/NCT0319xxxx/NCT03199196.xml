      The goal of this research study is to learn if enrolling in a program with a partner that&#xD;
      involves monitoring each other's physical activity and providing support to one another can&#xD;
      help both participants be more physically active.&#xD;

      Study Groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you and your partner will be&#xD;
      randomly assigned (as in a flip of a coin) to be in 1 of 2 groups after you complete the&#xD;
      first in-person visit. You will have an equal chance of being in any group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are assigned to Group 1, the following tests and procedures will be performed:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will wear an activity tracker that you will be given at the baseline visit. The&#xD;
           activity tracker is a small device worn on your wrist that records how many steps you&#xD;
           have taken.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will be instructed in the use of a smartphone application at the baseline visit&#xD;
           which you will use to track your physical activity, connect with your partner to share&#xD;
           information about your physical activity, and provide support to your partner to be more&#xD;
           physically active.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have 6 counseling calls over the telephone throughout the study with a trained&#xD;
           counselor and your partner.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will be emailed electronic newsletters to read that may help you be more physically&#xD;
           active.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are assigned to Group 2, you will be sent the newsletters that may help you be more&#xD;
      physically active and upon completing the16 week visit, you will be given an activity tracker&#xD;
      and instruction in the use of a smartphone application.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Visits:&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will visit MD Anderson Cancer Center, Windsor Village United Methodist Church, or a&#xD;
      community site 2 times (1 time at the beginning of the study, and 1 time 16 weeks after you&#xD;
      begin the study). Each visit should take about 90 minutes. The following procedures will be&#xD;
      performed:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Your blood pressure will be measured. If you have a blood pressure reading higher than&#xD;
           140/90 mm Hg, you can participate in this study only with a clearance letter from your&#xD;
           physician or nurse practitioner. If your blood pressure reading is higher than 180/120&#xD;
           mm Hg, the study staff must contact 911 and have EMS come and treat you due to your&#xD;
           blood pressure being dangerously high. You have the right to refuse EMS services but&#xD;
           study staff are still required to contact 911 immediately as a precaution. You will not&#xD;
           be able to continue in the study until the clearance letter has been received.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will complete questionnaires about your feelings, moods, your motivation for&#xD;
           physical activity, any social support you may receive from others, the neighborhood you&#xD;
           live in, and other physical activity-related topics. The questionnaires should take&#xD;
           about 45 minutes to complete. For the 2nd visit, you will have the option of completing&#xD;
           the questionnaire online before your scheduled visit. This may reduce the length of your&#xD;
           2nd visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will be asked about your diet (for example, what you eat and drink each day).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Your height, weight, and waist and hip circumference will be measured. To measure your&#xD;
           waist and hip circumference, you may be asked to lift your shirt to expose your stomach&#xD;
           area and lower your pants to expose your mid-hip area. The height, weight, and waist and&#xD;
           hip circumference measurements should take about 10 minutes and will be performed in a&#xD;
           private area.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Your heart rate variability (HRV) will be measured with a wrist watch and a belt band.&#xD;
           To measure your HRV, you will be asked to lift your shirt to expose your upper stomach&#xD;
           area (at the breast bone). The band will be damp and should make firm contact with your&#xD;
           skin. Â°You will wear the device for 5 minutes while it records your HRV as you sit&#xD;
           quietly.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will be given an accelerometer at each visit. You will wear the accelerometer for 7&#xD;
           days and then return it in an pre-addressed envelope provided to you. An accelerometer&#xD;
           is a small device that is worn on your hip that measures the amount of physical activity&#xD;
           you do.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At 8 weeks after you begin the study, you will answer some questions either over the phone or&#xD;
      through an online survey. The questions will cover the same topics as for the in-person&#xD;
      visits. This should take about 30 minutes to complete.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will be invited to take part in a final focus group. This focus group will&#xD;
      take place sometime after the 16-week visit. You will be asked what you think about the&#xD;
      study, including what you liked, did not like, and how you think it could be improved. If you&#xD;
      want to provide this feedback but you cannot come to the focus group, you may provide&#xD;
      feedback in another way (such as a phone interview or you could meet the study staff at the&#xD;
      church or a community setting). These focus groups/interviews will be audio recorded. Your&#xD;
      name and identifying information will be deleted from the recording before being transcribed&#xD;
      (typed out) by an outside party. This should take about 90 minutes. The digital audio files&#xD;
      will be destroyed within 10 years after publication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Length of Study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Your participation on this study will be over after you complete the final focus group visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additional Information:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are assigned to Group 1, you may be contacted by phone or mail while you are taking&#xD;
      part in this study to remind you about study visits, study procedures, and counseling calls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will be asked to give the names and contact information of family members and/or friends&#xD;
      for the study staff to contact in the event they cannot reach you first.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The counseling calls for Group 1 will be recorded to monitor counseling procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will also be asked to participate in two optional procedures. First, you will be asked to&#xD;
      &quot;friend&quot; your counselor on the mobile application so that the counselor can monitor your&#xD;
      steps in preparation for the counseling calls. Second, you will also be asked to share your&#xD;
      user ID and password for the activity tracker. This will enable research staff to download&#xD;
      your physical activity data that will help staff to understand how much participants are&#xD;
      using the device and how many steps they are taking. These data will only be examined during&#xD;
      the 16-week study period, and you will be instructed to change your password at the end of&#xD;
      the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the accelerometer is lost or stolen, you will not be responsible for the replacement cost,&#xD;
      but you should tell the study staff right away.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will be able to keep the activity tracker after the study is complete.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Your home address may be used to access public information about the area where you live.&#xD;
      This is to help researchers learn about how your neighborhood encourages physical activity.&#xD;
      The results from this study will only be reported as a group and you will not be identifiable&#xD;
      from any products resulting from this study (such as research papers). Your home address will&#xD;
      never be released or published in any form. Your address will be stored separately from other&#xD;
      study data, and only the study chair will be able to see the data after the neighborhood&#xD;
      information has been collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You may be contacted in the future to see if you would agree to take part in other research&#xD;
      studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Women who are pregnant or thinking about becoming pregnant during the study period will no&#xD;
      longer be able to participate. If you become pregnant during this study, please tell the&#xD;
      study staff right away.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an investigational study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 64 participants will take part in this study. All will be enrolled at MD Anderson.&#xD;
