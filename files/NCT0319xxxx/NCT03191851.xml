  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Ascites is the accumulation of fluid inside the abdomen. This can happen when the liver fails&#xD;
      due to a substantial amount of scarring (cirrhosis). Patients (pts) must have this fluid&#xD;
      drained and as cirrhosis progresses, patients will require drainage of ascites repeatedly on&#xD;
      a regular basis, leading to frequent hospitals visits and increased complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The current drainage device is slow and doesn't always drain completely so pts have to return&#xD;
      repeatedly to keep symptoms under control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A new device (called Melody) has been developed and specifically designed for the purpose of&#xD;
      draining ascites fluid, which the Investigators expect to drain faster and completely.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will compare the volume of ascites drained using the new 'Melody' catheter device&#xD;
      with that used in standard NHS practice. If the melody catheter device is confirmed as&#xD;
      superior to the current device this would improve patient experience (less frequent visits to&#xD;
      hospital and increased length of time between visits).&#xD;
&#xD;
      With fewer procedures performed per patient, the pressure on the NHS would be greatly reduced&#xD;
      in terms of time and costs.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Large volume paracentesis has been established as a treatment for symptomatic ascites and is&#xD;
      performed regularly in secondary care hospitals widely across the UK.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lack of a device specifically designed to perform paracentesis means that flow of ascites&#xD;
      fluid through the catheter is not optimal leading to incomplete drainage and hence, frequent&#xD;
      repeated paracentesis as well as a number of complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A new 'Melody' catheter device has been designed and developed in collaboration with Mediplus&#xD;
      Ltd and NIHR Enteric Bowel function Healthcare Technology Co-operative; specifically designed&#xD;
      to improve the performance characteristics of paracentesis procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      (The 'Melody ascites drainage catheter' including 'sterile ascetic drainage sets' is CE&#xD;
      marked for clinical use). In addition, investigators would also like to confirm whether the&#xD;
      addition of a pump will improve drainage with this device further.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Investigators propose to carry out a feasibility study, 'EMPATHY', with an aim to compare&#xD;
      the performance characteristics of 'Melody' catheter device (with and without addition of&#xD;
      'Andromeda' pump) with the current device. 112 patients with ascites requiring therapeutic&#xD;
      paracentesis will be randomised to undergo the procedure using one of the two devices. The&#xD;
      volume of ascites drained per session will be compared along with ease of insertion and&#xD;
      removal as well as patient experience including all adverse events up to 7 days following the&#xD;
      procedure. The outcomes of this feasibility study will inform further refinement of the&#xD;
      'Melody' catheter device as well as a future large multi-centre randomised controlled trial&#xD;
      evaluating the cost-effectiveness of the new 'Melody' catheter device in therapeutic&#xD;
      paracentesis&#xD;
