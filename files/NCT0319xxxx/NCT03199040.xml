    <textblock>
      This is a single institution, open-label randomized phase 1 trial of neoantigen DNA vaccine&#xD;
      alone vs. neoantigen DNA vaccine plus durvalumab in triple negative breast cancer (TNBC)&#xD;
      patients following standard of care therapy. Patients with newly diagnosed clinical stage&#xD;
      II-III TNBC are eligible for enrollment. Patients will receive standard of care therapy&#xD;
      including chemotherapy, surgery and radiation therapy as clinically indicated. Following&#xD;
      standard of care therapy, patients will be randomized to receive either a neoantigen DNA&#xD;
      vaccine alone, or a neoantigen DNA vaccine + durvalumab.&#xD;

    <description>The first neoantigen DNA vaccine injection will take place following the completion of standard of care therapy. The day of the first vaccine injection will be referred to as Day 1&#xD;
The schedule of vaccination is Day 1, Day 29 ± 7, Day 57 ± 7, Day 85 ± 7, Day 113 ± 7, and Day 141 ± 7 with at least 21 days between injection days&#xD;
For patients who are randomized to the neoantigen DNA vaccine plus durvalumab arm, the neoantigen-specific T cell response will be assessed prior to Day 85. If a neoantigen-specific T cell response is present, durvalumab will be started on Day 85, and will be administered Q4W at a dose of 1500 mg over the course of 60 minutes. If a neoantigen-specific T cell response is not present, these patients will be replaced but may continue to receive the neoantigen DNA vaccine on study. They will not be transferred to the vaccine-only arm.</description>
