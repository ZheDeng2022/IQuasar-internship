      The purpose of this study is to develop population pharmacokinetic models for antiretroviral&#xD;
      drugs in a pediatric population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The interest of these models is multiple :&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  describe the pharmacokinetics of these drugs in children and explain the&#xD;
           inter-individual variability of concentrations through covariates such as weight, age,&#xD;
           sex, smoking status, co-treatments and bilirubin;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  estimate maximum, minimum and exposure concentrations from the individual&#xD;
           pharmacokinetic parameters for each patient;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  propose adaptations of doses for certain classes of children (according to age, weight&#xD;
           etc.) and individualize the doses.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      HIV (Human Immunodeficiency Virus) affects 36.7 million people worldwide. Major advances have&#xD;
      been made in the discovery of antiretroviral therapy, significantly improving the lives of&#xD;
      patients. Although these treatments have been studied and validated in adults, ethical and&#xD;
      technical difficulties are hampering research in the pediatric population. However, it is&#xD;
      important to know the administration patterns in children, as during its development,&#xD;
      multiple physiological changes affect the pharmacokinetics as well as pharmacodynamics of&#xD;
      drugs. As a result, the child can not be considered as a small adult and it is not possible&#xD;
      to adjust the dosage by taking into account only his weight, age or body surface area.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In France, monitoring of HIV-infected children includes quantification of viral load and may&#xD;
      also include pharmacological therapeutic monitoring. In fact, blood samples in children are&#xD;
      taken to verify compliance is correct and their plasma concentrations are considered to be&#xD;
      effective. Many data are thus generated and not exploited. However, a population&#xD;
      pharmacokinetic method would allow us to understand the variability of concentrations&#xD;
      existing between these children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Demographic factors (age, sex, weight, smoking status, etc.) and clinical (bilirubinemia,&#xD;
      viral load, genetics, co-treatments, etc.) can be included as covariates to explain&#xD;
      inter-individual variability. This method of study is interesting in pediatrics because it&#xD;
      has the advantage of being able to include many patients with little sampling per subject.&#xD;
      The data used are generally plasma concentrations obtained as a result of sampling performed&#xD;
      as part of the therapeutic follow-up of patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In clinical practice, the pharmacokinetic model allows to simulate doses and frequencies of&#xD;
      administration but also to predict drug interactions. Indeed, patients infected with HIV are&#xD;
      often poly-medicated, which represents a risk of drug interactions, especially since many&#xD;
      molecules are inducing / inhibiting cytochromes P450.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main goal is to develop population pharmacokinetic models for antiretroviral drugs in&#xD;
      children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The interest of these models is multiple:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  describe the pharmacokinetics of these drugs in children and explain the&#xD;
           inter-individual variability of concentrations through covariates such as weight, age,&#xD;
           sex, smoking status, co-treatments and bilirubin;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  estimate maximum, minimum and exposure concentrations from the individual&#xD;
           pharmacokinetic parameters for each patient;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  propose adaptations of doses for certain classes of children (according to age, weight&#xD;
           etc.) and individualize the doses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objectives of this work are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Build models jointly with several antiretroviral drugs, accounting for the strength of&#xD;
           interactions between them during multiple therapies.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Link antiretroviral concentrations to the effects of treatment (decreased viral load) :&#xD;
           pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic study with concentration / efficacy and concentration /&#xD;
           toxicity relationships.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The evaluation of preexisting models in the literature and the comparison of our data&#xD;
           with the results of these models (external validation).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pharmaco-statistical analysis will be carried out on the retrospective data of patients&#xD;
      treated with one or more antiretroviral molecule(s) and whose blood dosage of the drug(s) as&#xD;
      part of their therapeutic follow-up is available&#xD;
