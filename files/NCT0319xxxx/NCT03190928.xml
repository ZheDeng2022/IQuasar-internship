      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follicular lymphoma is a type of cancer of the lymph nodes. Lab studies are important for&#xD;
      cancer research. They help scientists better understand differences in the cancer biology of&#xD;
      different patients. Researchers want to collect serial samples over time from people with&#xD;
      follicular lymphoma to help them design future treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To collect a variety of samples from people with follicular lymphoma to study how these&#xD;
      diseases progress and respond to treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adults at least 18 years old who have been diagnosed with, but have not yet had any treatment&#xD;
      for, follicular lymphoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be screened with medical history and physical exam. They will answer&#xD;
      questions about daily functioning. They will have blood and urine tests. They may have scans&#xD;
      and have tissue samples taken.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be monitored about every 4 months for up to 2 years. They will repeat&#xD;
      screening tests. They will have a cheek swab. A small brush will be rubbed against the inside&#xD;
      of the cheek to wipe off some cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have imaging scans about every 8 months for up to 2 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants may have a bone marrow aspiration and biopsy. The hipbone will be numbed with a&#xD;
      small needle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A needle will be put into the hipbone, and about 2 tablespoons of bone marrow will be taken&#xD;
      out through the needle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will continue being monitored every 6 months for up to 5 years, then 1 time a&#xD;
      year.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Follicular lymphoma (FL) is the second most common form of non-Hodgkin lymphoma and is&#xD;
           incurable with standard first-line systemic therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The clinical course of FL varies from slowly progressive over many years to a more rapid&#xD;
           disease course that requires therapy shortly after diagnosis&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Early initiation of therapy does not improve survival, and asymptomatic patients are&#xD;
           often managed with an initial period of watchful waiting&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Clinical prognostic indices predict survival, but cannot predict outcome for individual&#xD;
           patients; biologic-based classifiers (gene-expression profiling and somatic mutational&#xD;
           analyses) are more robust than clinical indices, but require prospective clinical&#xD;
           validation from the time of diagnosis in the modern treatment era&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Paired samples linked to clinical information can lead to the discovery and/or&#xD;
           validation of therapeutic targets for FL patients at the highest risk of early disease&#xD;
           progression&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Characterize the molecular biology and clinical course of FL patients, and evaluate the time&#xD;
      to treatment initiation for those patients who require first-line systemic therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Follicular lymphoma (grade 1-2, 3a) with no evidence of histological transformation&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  No previous cytotoxic, biologic or monoclonal antibody therapy for FL (previous&#xD;
           radiation therapy permitted)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Age greater than or equal to 18 years&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  ECOG performance status of 0-2&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients with FL who meet all eligibility criteria will enroll on the study for expert&#xD;
           monitoring of their disease, improved risk-stratification, and donation of tissue and&#xD;
           cellular products for research. Patients will be monitored prospectively until they&#xD;
           require second-line systemic treatment or the patient decides to withdraw from the&#xD;
           study; untreated patients will be followed with clinic visits every 4 months for the&#xD;
           first 2 years. After 2 years, protocol-specified visits will be increased to every 6&#xD;
           months until 5 years. After 5 years, protocol-specified visits will be annually until&#xD;
           disease progression requiring first-line therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients without an indication for first-line systemic therapy at 2 years from initial&#xD;
           study enrollment will be offered an optional biopsy of their lymph node and bone marrow.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  During first-line systemic therapy, patients can continue being monitored on this study&#xD;
           for post-therapy clonal evolution. Protocol-specified visits after therapy will be every&#xD;
           6 months until 3 years. After 3 years, protocol-specified visits will be annually until&#xD;
           disease progression requiring second-line therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Upon initiation of second-line therapy, if applicable, patients will move to survival&#xD;
           follow-up only.&#xD;

    <study_pop>
      <textblock>
        Up to 200 patients with pathologically-confirmed follicular lymphoma (grades 1-2, 3a) will&#xD;
        be enrolled and screened for eligibility, and up to 80 eligible patients will receive&#xD;

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Histologically or cytologically confirmed follicular lymphoma (FL), grades 1-2, or 3a&#xD;
             confirmed by the Laboratory of Pathology, NCI; patients who meet criteria for&#xD;
             immediate initiation of systemic therapy are eligible&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Adequate tissue available from original diagnostic biopsy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        NOTE: If biopsy was &gt;12 months prior to enrollment OR adequate tissue is not available,&#xD;
        tissue biopsy may be optionally repeated at study enrollment unless such a biopsy is&#xD;
        considered unacceptable risk to the patient. Patients without adequate tissue are eligible&#xD;
        at the discretion of the PI.&#xD;
&#xD;
        - Must have disease that is measurable or evaluable on either computed tomography (CT)&#xD;
        scans or FDG-positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) scans&#xD;
&#xD;
        NOTE: Since patients with FL may have lesions that wax and wane on imaging, the requirement&#xD;
        for disease being measurable or evaluable can come from imaging taken at any time at or&#xD;
        after diagnosis, the most recent imaging prior to enrollment does not need&#xD;
&#xD;
        to show measurable or evaluable disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
        - Age greater than or equal to 18 years&#xD;
&#xD;
        NOTE: Patients with the pediatric-type follicular lymphoma are usually &lt;18 years of age,&#xD;
        and often have a very different clinical course than patients with the adult-type of FL.&#xD;
        Due to this difference in biology, children are excluded from this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        - ECOG performance status &lt;2 (Karnofsky &gt;60%)&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Previous history of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma or histologic transformation&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any prior systemic treatment for lymphoma including cytotoxic chemotherapy, biologic&#xD;
             therapy, and monoclonal antibody therapy (radiotherapy permitted); patients who have&#xD;
             received chemotherapy, biologic therapy, hormonal therapy, or monoclonal antibody for&#xD;
             other malignancies are potentially eligible provided that all of the following are&#xD;
             true: a) that malignancy was not lymphoma, b) systemic therapy ended at least 3 years&#xD;
             prior to the diagnosis of FL, and c) there is no evidence of active malignancy other&#xD;
             than FL&#xD;
&#xD;
        NOTE: Initiation of first-line systemic therapy is allowed while on this trial; concurrent&#xD;
        participation in first-line treatment clinical trials will be permitted.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who are HIV-positive&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any second malignancy that requires active systemic therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any other (non-lymphoma) life-threatening disease&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients unable to provide informed consent (surrogates will not be used)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant women are excluded from enrollment onto this study because the invasive&#xD;
             procedures and/or sedation needed to perform these may cause unnecessary harm to the&#xD;
             unborn fetus. In the event a woman becomes pregnant while on study, she will not be&#xD;
             removed from the study; however, no follow-up invasive clinical or research procedures&#xD;
             will be done that include unacceptable to risk to the patient and/or to the unborn&#xD;
             fetus.&#xD;
