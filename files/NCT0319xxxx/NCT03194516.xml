  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Men with indolent forms of prostate cancer are managed expectantly using active surveillance,&#xD;
      with a goal of delaying treatment and its deleterious side effects. However, almost 50% of&#xD;
      men experience progression with this approach and require treatment. Elevated body mass index&#xD;
      (BMI) is associated with a dramatically increased risk of progression to higher grade&#xD;
      prostate cancer. The goal of the proposed research is to gather preliminary data evaluating&#xD;
      the effects of a promising dietary strategy to delay cancer progression in overweight and&#xD;
      obese prostate cancer patients undergoing active surveillance. The investigators hypothesize&#xD;
      that a ketogenic diet intervention may reduce BMI and favorably alter the prostate&#xD;
      microenvironment.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      More than 1.6 million new cases of cancer are estimated in the United States in 2016, with&#xD;
      almost 600,000 individuals dying from the disease. Prostate cancer alone is responsible for&#xD;
      180,000 new diagnoses per year and remains the most common new cancer diagnosis for men.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Current treatment options for prostate cancer include surgery, radiation, high-intensity&#xD;
      focused ultrasound, and cryotherapy. Although typically successful, these strategies carry&#xD;
      significant risks for incontinence, erectile dysfunction, and local tissue injury. As a&#xD;
      result, for a select subgroup of men with more indolent forms of prostate cancer, active&#xD;
      surveillance has become the preferred management strategy. This approach entails periodic&#xD;
      laboratory testing, with prostate-specific antigen (PSA) checks at intervals of 3-6 months,&#xD;
      and repeat prostate biopsies every 1-2 years or earlier if indicated by PSA elevations.&#xD;
      Treatment interventions are typically withheld unless re-biopsy results indicate progression&#xD;
      to more aggressive disease. Prospective data comparing surgery and active surveillance have&#xD;
      demonstrated improved quality of life outcomes with the latter approach . Not surprisingly,&#xD;
      national registry data shows that active surveillance usage has increased from &lt;15% between&#xD;
      1990 and 2009 to &gt;40% between 2010 and 2013 for eligible patients . In order to ensure proper&#xD;
      patient selection for active surveillance, MRI guided confirmation biopsies have become&#xD;
      standard of care options. Almost one-third of patients will be found to harbor more&#xD;
      aggressive cancer than revealed by their initial biopsy. Ideally, treatment could be delayed&#xD;
      indefinitely for properly selected patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although surveillance offers a reprieve from cancer treatment and its potential negative&#xD;
      sequelae, this benefit appears temporary for many men. Institutional cohort data indicate&#xD;
      that 36%-55% of men on active surveillance will require treatment for disease progression&#xD;
      within 10 years. One notable risk factor for disease progression during surveillance is&#xD;
      overweight and obesity. In a study of 565 prostate cancer patients on surveillance, a 50%&#xD;
      increased risk of pathologic progression was associated with every 5 kg/m2 increase in BMI&#xD;
      over 25. These results support additional evidence linking weight gain with an increased risk&#xD;
      of prostate cancer recurrence after surgery. They have also prompted studies examining&#xD;
      pre-surgical weight loss using caloric restriction to mitigate the risk associated with&#xD;
      obesity. A low carbohydrate, ketogenic approach has been previously studied in small samples&#xD;
      of patients with other types of cancer and also proposed for prostate cancer patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In brief, a ketogenic diet is a high-fat, low-carbohydrate diet that mimics the metabolic&#xD;
      state of long-term fasting. Ketone bodies are generated mainly by ketogenesis in the&#xD;
      mitochondrial matrix of liver cells and are subsequently exported via the blood to other&#xD;
      organs to cover the energy demands of cells throughout the body. Ketogenic deaminated amino&#xD;
      acids such as leucine also feed the citric acid cycle to form ketone bodies. Utilization of a&#xD;
      ketogenic diet as an adjuvant prostate cancer therapy is particularly intriguing given recent&#xD;
      preclinical data demonstrating that ketones function as endogenous histone deacetylase (HDAC)&#xD;
      inhibitors. HDAC inhibitors have been shown to inhibit prostate cancer proliferation in&#xD;
      preclinical models, and are already being studied in clinical trials. Therefore, the&#xD;
      ketogenic diet may have a direct impact on disease progression that may extend beyond the BMI&#xD;
      reduction achievable by caloric restriction, exercise or other weight loss strategies.&#xD;

    <description>The investigators propose an 8-week ketogenic diet intervention with pre-/post-intervention assessment of serum and tissue metabolic and inflammatory biomarkers, including metabolomics analysis, among a sample of 12 overweight or obese prostate cancer patients on active surveillance. There will be no randomization; all patients will receive the diet intervention.</description>
