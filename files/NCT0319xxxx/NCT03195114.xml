  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objectives of this study are to: a) evaluate and correlate the severity of paravalvular&#xD;
      leak (PVL) assessed by both cardiac MRI and transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) after&#xD;
      transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) with Medtronic Evolut-R or Evolut PRO&#xD;
      bioprostheses; b) assess the inter and intraobserver variability of both imaging methods; and&#xD;
      c) correlate the severity of PVL with post-TAVR changes in LV remodeling and clinical&#xD;
      outcomes.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Paravalvular leak (PVL) represents the most common complication post-transcatheter aortic&#xD;
      valve replacement (TAVR). Presence of even mild PVL has been associated with unfavorable&#xD;
      outcomes including late mortality, which is physiologically and hemodynamically hard to be&#xD;
      reconciled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) is the first line test for the PVL&#xD;
      quantification, it can be flawed due to poor acoustic windows, eccentricity of PVL, image&#xD;
      degradation associated with the implanted prosthesis, irregular orifices, subjectivity and&#xD;
      inconsistency of the assessment and grading. Furthermore, to date, most published studies do&#xD;
      not use a uniform standardized way of quantifying the PVL. The Valve Academic Research&#xD;
      Consortium (VARC) published the VARC II definitions and suggested the use of TAVR-specific&#xD;
      criteria for the assessment of PVL. However, there has been no validation of this proposed&#xD;
      criteria and how their selected cutoffs correlate to patient outcomes. All these issues&#xD;
      contribute to uncertainty and imprecision of the current method, leading to difficulties and&#xD;
      subjectivity in the assessment and quantification of PVL severity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cardiac MRI (CMR) is able to directly quantify aortic regurgitation with high accuracy and&#xD;
      reproducibility by using the technique of phase-contrast velocity mapping when compared to&#xD;
      TTE. CMR had lower intraobserver and interobserver variabilities for regurgitant volume&#xD;
      assessment, suggesting that CMR may be superior for serial measurements. In addition, CMR&#xD;
      quantification of aortic regurgitant fraction allows risk-stratification identifying patients&#xD;
      at risk for development of heart failure and need for aortic valve surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, despite these advantages, the use of CMR for PVL assessment post-TAVR has been&#xD;
      limited. A recent single center prospective pilot study (n=16) showed that CMR assessment of&#xD;
      PVL was feasible using CoreValve prosthesis. In addition, CMR rather than TTE, correlated&#xD;
      better with intra-procedural aortography. TTE underestimated the degree of PVL compared to&#xD;
      CMR suggesting the opportunity of this modality to more reliably and accurately quantify PVL&#xD;
      after TAVR. Another recent small and single-center CMR study (n=43) compared immediate&#xD;
      post-TAVI CMR findings with those at 6-month follow-up. There were 32 patients (74%) treated&#xD;
      with Medtronic CoreValve prosthesis and 11 (26%) treated with Edwards Sapien XT valve. The&#xD;
      authors noted significant favorable LV remodeling at 6 months, but not in patients with &gt;&#xD;
      mild PVL. Furthermore, PVL quantified by CMR did not decrease over time. Given the small&#xD;
      number of patients, the authors could not compare the temporal changes between the two&#xD;
      prosthesis. In addition, the mechanisms associated with the changes in PVL severity were not&#xD;
      able to be ascertained given the study design.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CMR provides exquisite tissue characterization using late-gadolinium enhancement imaging.&#xD;
      Adverse myocardial response to pressure-overload causes maladaptive myocardial hypertrophy&#xD;
      with increased LV mass and also myocardial fibrosis (MF), which has been associated with&#xD;
      adverse outcomes despite aortic valve replacement. Newer CMR techniques such as T1 mapping&#xD;
      and extracellular volume fraction quantification can now non-invasively quantify the extent&#xD;
      of diffuse MF supported by histological validation. The interplay between PVL and MF and&#xD;
      their impact of on the LV reverse remodeling is unknown. It is possible that PVL might exert&#xD;
      its detrimental effects by slowing LV reverse remodeling, hampering the regression of LV&#xD;
      hypertrophy and myocardial fibrosis post-TAVR.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lastly, gated multi-detector computed tomography (MDCT) which has a critical role in the&#xD;
      pre-procedural planning of patients undergoing TAVR evaluation, also has been found important&#xD;
      in identifying predictors of PVL post-TAVR. However, the role of MDCT in the post-TAVR&#xD;
      setting, for PVL evaluation, has not been yet established. Gated MDCT post-TAVR might be&#xD;
      relevant to determine the interplay between the native aortic valve/annulus and the TAVR&#xD;
      prosthesis aiding in the evaluation of possible mechanism(s) behind PVL changes over time.&#xD;
