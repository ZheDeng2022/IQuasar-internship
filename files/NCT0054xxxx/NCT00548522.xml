      Type 1 diabetic women have a decrease in insulin requirements during early pregnancy.&#xD;
      Preliminary evidence suggests this decrease may be secondary to the regeneration of&#xD;
      pancreatic B-cells during pregnancy During the second and third trimesters, insulin&#xD;
      requirements in Type 1 diabetic women progressively increase until approximately 36 weeks&#xD;
      gestation at which time there is a plateau, and frequently, a drop in insulin requirements.&#xD;
      We hypothesize that there is regeneration of pancreatic islet cell mass in Type 1 diabetic&#xD;
      women during pregnancy. In a cross-sectional study, we will use the acute insulin c-peptide&#xD;
      response to arginine to determine if pancreatic islet mass increases at 12 and 36 weeks&#xD;
      gestation. Type 1 diabetic women who are not pregnant, who are at 12 and 36 weeks gestation,&#xD;
      and who are 6 weeks post-partum will undergo an intravenous arginine tolerance test following&#xD;
      an overnight fast. If we find that there is regeneration of beta cells it opens the&#xD;
      possibility that therapy may be directed to the same end for people with Type 1 diabetes.&#xD;

      For the pilot phase of this study we will contact women with type 1 diabetes. The study will&#xD;
      be explained and the subjects will be asked to sign an informed consent. Each subject will be&#xD;
      asked to complete a brief medical history and lifestyle questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will have blood samples taken for glucose and C-peptide and an intravenous arginine&#xD;
      stimulation test. For the study tests, subjects will be asked to come to the Clinical&#xD;
      Investigations Unit at the University of Alberta Hospital after an overnight fast only once&#xD;
      during the study. The intravenous arginine test is a 10 minute test and does not cause&#xD;
      hyperglycemia, an advantage over glucose in the setting of pregnancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arginine infusion The intravenous arginine infusion test will be performed after an overnight&#xD;
      fast greater than or equal to 8 hours. Subjects may drink water. For the Type 1 diabetic&#xD;
      patients on insulin, long-acting insulin may be taken no less than 8 hours prior to the test;&#xD;
      no food or short-acting insulin may be taken within 5 hours of the test. Lispro insulin&#xD;
      should not be taken within 4 hours of the test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the morning of the test, an intravenous catheter, using a 20 gauge IV intercath, will be&#xD;
      placed in an antecubital vein in one arm both for sampling and for infusion. Veins will be&#xD;
      kept patent with an infusion of NaCl (0.9%) at 25 mL/hr throughout the test. The arm from&#xD;
      which samples are obtained will be warmed to 55 C with a heating blanket to assist in the&#xD;
      arterialization of the venous samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline blood samples for glucose and C-peptide measurements will be drawn in a serum gel&#xD;
      barrier tube at minus 10 and 0 minutes. An injection of 5 g of arginine (20 ml Sabex) diluted&#xD;
      with 20 ml normal saline to equal 40 ml will be administered over 30 seconds, starting at&#xD;
      time 0. The vein will immediately be flushed with 20mL normal saline. Blood samples for&#xD;
      insulin and C-peptide will be drawn in barrier tubes at 2, 3, 4, 5, 7 and 10 minutes and&#xD;
      serum will be separated and transferred into a cryogenic tube for analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The acute C-peptide response to arginine is defined as the mean of the three highest insulin&#xD;
      or C-peptide values between 2 and 5 minutes after the start of the arginine infusion with the&#xD;
      mean of the minus 10 and 0 values subtracted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood samples (basal and stimulated) will be analyzed for glucose and C-peptide. The insulin&#xD;
      response will not be measured in these Type 1 subjects as it would be meaningless and the&#xD;
      C-peptide response will be used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood glucose will be determined by the hexokinase method using the Hitachi 917 system (Roche&#xD;
      Diagnostics, Indianapolis, IN).&#xD;
&#xD;
      C-peptide assay An Ultrasensitive C-peptide ELISA method will be used to analyze for&#xD;
      C-peptide. This test is specific for low concentrations of C-peptide in blood, specifically&#xD;
      for patients with abnormal insulin secretion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis/Power calculation&#xD;
&#xD;
      Upon the significance test results for group differences, we will proceed with multiple&#xD;
      comparisons of groups to locate the source of significance, while adjusting for multiple&#xD;
      significance testing, using the method of Bonferroni.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expected Possible Findings/ Conclusion&#xD;
&#xD;
      We hope to show that pancreatic islet mass may be present in women with Type 1 diabetes. Any&#xD;
      demonstration of beta-cell recovery even in the unique setting of pregnancy would be&#xD;
      exciting, as it would demonstrate progenitor beta cells present in the pancreas in type 1&#xD;
      diabetes subjects.&#xD;
