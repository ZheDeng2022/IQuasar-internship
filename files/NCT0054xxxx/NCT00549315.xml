      The Valiant stent-graft system is a flexible, implantable vascular stent-graft endoluminal&#xD;
      device preloaded in a delivery system that is used to exclude thoracic aortic lesions&#xD;
      (thoracic aneurysms, thoracic dissections, penetrating ulcers, traumatic transections and&#xD;
      both traumatic and degenerative pseudoaneurysms.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A vascular aneurysm is a permanent, localized dilatation of a blood vessel at least 1 1/2 to&#xD;
      2 times the normal vessel diameter. The aorta is the most frequent site for aneurysms, with&#xD;
      approximately 10% of aortic aneurysms located above the renal arteries in the thoracic&#xD;
      segment. Thoracic aortic aneurysms (TAAs) are less common than abdominal aorta, however,&#xD;
      detection of TAAs is increasing, perhaps due to an aging population, increased diagnostic&#xD;
      capability or an increase in prevalence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Untreated thoracic aneurysms can be life-threatening. As many as 78% of untreated patients&#xD;
      with TAA die within 5 years after diagnosis, most often from rupture of the aneurysm.&#xD;
      Conventional surgical treatment, either tube graft placement or patch aortoplasty, is a high&#xD;
      risk surgical procedure. Repair of the thoracic descending aorta is performed with a&#xD;
      thoracotomy and cross-clamping of the aorta, with or without a shunt by-pass to maintain&#xD;
      distal perfusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As an alternative to conventional surgery, a less invasive endovascular procedure has been&#xD;
      developed that may be used to treat certain aneurysms. A collapsed stent-graft, a metal stent&#xD;
      coupled with a fabric graft, is introduced into the vasculature, advanced to the size of the&#xD;
      aneurysm, and deployed to span the aneurysm. The device creates a new aortic lumen, excluding&#xD;
      the aneurysm sac from blood flow while maintaining flow within the stent-graft. This less&#xD;
      invasive technique is designed to prevent or decrease the need for open surgery, to reduce&#xD;
      the need for blood transfusion, to decrease the use of anesthetics and other drugs, and to&#xD;
      speed recovery time. A reduction in intensive care and total hospital stay should result,&#xD;
      leading to an increase quality of life following the procedure and a reduction in cost.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of this investigational plan is to determine the safety of the Valiant&#xD;
      endoluminal device when used to exclude thoracic lesions: true descending thoracic aortic&#xD;
      aneurysms, dissections, penetrating ulcers, traumatic transections and traumatic and&#xD;
      degenerative pseudoaneurysms from blood flow in high risk and low risk patients who are&#xD;
      candidates for endoluminal repair.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients should be heparinized during the implant procedure (recommended activated clotting&#xD;
      time is 200-300 seconds). During implantation of the Valiant endoluminal stent-graft, the&#xD;
      pre-implant angiogram and CT scan are used together with (on-the-table) intravascular&#xD;
      ultrasound (IVUS), digital subtraction angiography (DAS), roadmapping, and angiography for&#xD;
      proper implant positioning. The Valiant endoluminal stent-graft endoprosthesis is inserted by&#xD;
      delivery catheter and introducer sheath via a surgical cutdown (e.g., external iliac artery,&#xD;
      femoral artery, common iliac artery conduit, etc.) approach. The introducer sheath and&#xD;
      delivery catheter containing the stent-graft is inserted over a guidewire and advanced into&#xD;
      the aorta and above the aneurysm. With the delivery catheter in the correct position, the&#xD;
      introducer sheath is then withdrawn further until the stent-graft is completely deployed. A&#xD;
      separate stent-graft balloon catheter system is provided with the device and may be used&#xD;
      along the full length of the implanted device to model the springs against the vessel wall&#xD;
      and to unravel possible wrinkles in the graft fabric. After deployment of the stent-graft,&#xD;
      angiography is performed to verify implant position and to check for the presence of&#xD;
      endoleaks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will undergo an evaluation of the Valiant endoluminal stent-graft to determine the&#xD;
      safety and efficacy of the device as indicated by the adverse event rate, and to determine&#xD;
      the risk factors that are most predictive of a successful outcome when used to exclude&#xD;
      thoracic aortic aneurysms that require suprarenal fixation in high risk and low risk&#xD;
      patients. Follow-up will be completed at 1, 6, 12, 24, 36, 48, and 60 months. Subject&#xD;
      evaluation at 1 month will include a Complete Physical Exam, Labs (BUN and Creatinine), and a&#xD;
      Thoracic Spiral CT with and without IV contrast 2.5 mm. Subject evaluation at 6, 12, 24, 36,&#xD;
      48, and 60 months will include a Complete Physical Exam, Chest X-ray (AP, Lateral), Labs (BUN&#xD;
      and Creatinine), and a Thoracic Spiral CT with and without IV contrast 2.5 mm.&#xD;
