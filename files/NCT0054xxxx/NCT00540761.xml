  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Atherosclerosis, a condition in which fatty deposits of plaque build up along the inner walls&#xD;
      of arteries, is a condition that may increase the risk of having a heart attack. Previous&#xD;
      studies have shown that the presence of a specific kind of plaque, known as vulnerable&#xD;
      plaque, is often found in people who have had a heart attack. This study will use a new&#xD;
      imaging technique called optical frequency domain imaging (OFDI) to examine the presence of&#xD;
      vulnerable plaques in people with coronary artery disease.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Atherosclerosis is a condition in which deposits of fat, cholesterol, and other substances&#xD;
      build up along the inner walls of arteries; these deposits are known as plaque. As plaque&#xD;
      builds up, it increases the risk of heart attack. Previous autopsy studies have shown that&#xD;
      vulnerable plaques, a type of atherosclerotic plaque, are commonly found in people who have&#xD;
      had a heart attack. Until recently it has been difficult to identify vulnerable plaques in&#xD;
      people prior to their death. Many people who have coronary artery disease and are at risk of&#xD;
      having a heart attack undergo angioplasty, a procedure that opens a narrowed or blocked blood&#xD;
      vessel. During angioplasty, imaging devices are often used to take pictures of the inside of&#xD;
      blood vessels. The most commonly used imaging device, an intravenous ultrasound (IVUS)&#xD;
      catheter, is threaded through the blood vessels and uses sound waves to take pictures. An&#xD;
      OFDI is a new type of catheter that takes more detailed pictures of blood vessel walls and&#xD;
      plaques. The additional detail provided by OFDI images may improve detection of vulnerable&#xD;
      plaques, which may help physicians identify people who are at high risk of having a heart&#xD;
      attack. This study will use standard IVUS imaging and OFDI to examine vulnerable plaques&#xD;
      within blood vessels of the heart and to evaluate any changes that occur over time in heart&#xD;
      blood vessels and plaque.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will enroll people with coronary artery disease who are undergoing angioplasty. At&#xD;
      a baseline study visit, participants will first undergo an angiography procedure, in which&#xD;
      x-ray pictures will be taken of the heart blood vessels. Participants will then be randomly&#xD;
      assigned to undergo either the IVUS procedure followed by the OFDI procedure or vice versa.&#xD;
      Repeat angiographies will occur after each imaging procedure. Next, participants will undergo&#xD;
      angioplasty and a stent will be placed at the area of the blood vessel that is narrowed or&#xD;
      blocked to keep the blood vessel open. Finally, participants will undergo repeat IVUS and&#xD;
      OFDI procedures. For some participants, the study physician may perform the IVUS and OFDI&#xD;
      procedures only after the angioplasty. Every six months and for a period of two years,&#xD;
      participants will complete questionnaires about medication history and heart problems that&#xD;
      may have occurred since the baseline visit.Blood collection will occur if this is done during&#xD;
      office visit.&#xD;
