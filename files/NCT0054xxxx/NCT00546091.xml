      This study will explore the uses of three noninvasive imaging techniques-thermography, laser&#xD;
      Doppler imaging, and multispectral imaging-to test the blood flow of healthy volunteers. By&#xD;
      comparing these three techniques, researchers will be able to train these imaging systems to&#xD;
      better evaluate skin types and blood flow. The study will also test computer programs that&#xD;
      have been developed to correct for the effects of curvature and body hair on the images.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy volunteers must be older than 18 years of age and may not have had a history of&#xD;
      malignant tumors, skin disease, or vascular disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will undergo the following procedures on an outpatient basis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Three different types of images taken of the participant s forearm&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Thermography infrared thermal imaging to map skin temperature&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Laser Doppler imaging low-powered laser imaging to map blood flow in the skin&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Multispectral imaging near-infrared light imaging to measure total blood flow and oxygen&#xD;
           levels in the skin&#xD;
&#xD;
      A reactive hyperemia experiment, in which multispectral images will be taken of the&#xD;
      participant s forearm during and after the use of a blood pressure cuff&#xD;
&#xD;
      A hair removal experiment, in which images will be collected of the participant s forearm in&#xD;
      separate scans done before and after the hair is removed with a topical hair removal solution&#xD;
&#xD;
      The entire series of exams will take approximately one hour to perform.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This study is designed to calibrate three non-invasive and non-ionizing imaging techniques on&#xD;
      12 healthy volunteers. The three imaging techniques-- thermography, laser Doppler imaging and&#xD;
      multi-spectral imaging-- have been approved since 2001 for four clinical protocols already&#xD;
      approved by the NIH/NCI IRB for use on patients with Kaposi s sarcoma (KS). However, as our&#xD;
      laboratory continues to study and analyze the images collected on these protocols, we have&#xD;
      found that our analysis algorithms require some additional data from healthy volunteers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We aim to use the information we gather from healthy volunteers on this protocol to train our&#xD;
      imaging systems and calibrate our analysis methods to validate the results of the KS data&#xD;
      already collected. We aim to study different skin types, such as Caucasian, Asian and African&#xD;
      American, so that we can calibrate the melanin input value in our multi-spectral imaging&#xD;
      reconstruction algorithm. We also need to study the vasculature networks in the forearms of&#xD;
      the volunteers to compare to 'normal' values in the literature for the parameters we are&#xD;
      exploring, including temperature, vasculature, blood volume and blood oxygenation to validate&#xD;
      our reconstruction algorithm. We will also perform experiments of reactive hyperemia, where&#xD;
      the arm of the volunteer is occluded with an arm pressure cuff for five minutes, to study how&#xD;
      blood volume and blood oxygenation change during the experiment. Trends of&#xD;
      increasing/decreasing blood volume and blood oxygenation can also be compared with published&#xD;
      literature to validate our reconstruction algorithm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since we started collecting data from the KS patients, we have noticed that hair and&#xD;
      curvature of the surface of the skin interfere with our analysis techniques as well.&#xD;
      Therefore, we aim to assess algorithms developed to remove the effects of curvature and hair&#xD;
      on the images as part of our image analysis training. The intensity in the images is affected&#xD;
      by the curvature and must be corrected. We have developed algorithms to correct for this&#xD;
      curvature, but need to study normal disease-free skin to make sure that the values for blood&#xD;
      volume and blood oxygenation remain the same after the curvature correction is performed. We&#xD;
      also plan to collect images from a healthy volunteer s arm, remove the hair from the arm&#xD;
      using a topical hair removal solution, and then image the arm again. With this information,&#xD;
      we can optimize our hair removal algorithm. Combining all of the aforementioned information&#xD;
      will allow us to develop a non-invasive strategy for repeated serial assessments of tissue&#xD;
      vasculature.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When following KS lesions over time, the vascular / metabolic changes in the lesion are&#xD;
      important. An additional parameter is of interest when following the treatment over time,&#xD;
      which is the structure of the lesion. Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) is a non-invasive,&#xD;
      non-contact optical imaging technology, which provides this desired structural information&#xD;
      with high resolution and in three dimensions (3D) over the area of interest. Therefore we aim&#xD;
      to combine OCT with multi-spectral data, relating the metabolic state of the tissue with&#xD;
      structure. By doing this, we hypothesize that we can not only get deeper understanding of&#xD;
      tissue vasculature, but that we can also improve the multi-spectral imaging modality, by&#xD;
      using the structure as prior information for the reconstruction.&#xD;
