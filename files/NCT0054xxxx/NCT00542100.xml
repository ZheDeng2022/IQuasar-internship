      The aim of the clinical study is to evaluate the convenience and efficacy of the PCMRI in the&#xD;
      assessment of the prostate in humans.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study cohort will include 50 patients and is designed to be non-comparative to other&#xD;
      diagnostic methods.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Prostate cancer (PC) is the most common male malignancy in the western world. In the U.S.&#xD;
      there are approximately 230,000 new diagnoses annually. Each year, 40,000 men with&#xD;
      established disease die from PC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Early detection is possible using prostate specific antigen (PSA) and/or DRE, followed by&#xD;
      biopsy if PC is suspected. Biopsy is generally carried out under transrectal ultrasound&#xD;
      (TRUS) guidance through the rectum wall. Typically, 6-13 samples from different areas of the&#xD;
      prostate are taken in order to cover the entire gland area. Since TRUS cannot accurately&#xD;
      detect PC, prostate biopsies, to date, are in fact random biopsies. Furthermore, PSA may be&#xD;
      elevated, in patients without PC, leading to as many as 75% of patients undergoing&#xD;
      unnecessary TRUS guided biopsy [1,2].&#xD;
&#xD;
      The need for accurate preoperative evaluation of PC, as well as early detection of the tumor&#xD;
      has lead to numerous applications of Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) of the prostate.1 The&#xD;
      sensitivity and specificity of whole body MRI with pelvic phased-array coils is as low as&#xD;
      ~70%. Improved sensitivity is obtained using an endorectal coil where efficacies of ~85% are&#xD;
      reported due to the improved signal to noise ratio (SNR) of such coils.2&#xD;
&#xD;
      One of the major limitations of conventional MRI scanners is their cost and limited&#xD;
      availability. A portable, hand-held MR scanner capable of detecting PC is thus, of interest.&#xD;
      TopSpin has developed a novel MRI based system for prostate imaging in Urology. The primary&#xD;
      use of the prostate MRI probe will be diagnosis, staging and guidance of minimally invasive&#xD;
      therapy for PC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The system consists of a miniaturized transrectal MRI probe, incorporating all magnetic field&#xD;
      sources and coils. The MRI probe is integrated with and used in conjunction with a TRUS&#xD;
      system. The TRUS probe provides prostate gross anatomy and allows the Urologist to select the&#xD;
      cross-section(s) of interest within the prostate. The MRI probe provides MRI images of the&#xD;
      selected cross-section(s) with improved tissue characterization that enable localizing tumors&#xD;
      within the prostate. Fusion of both images has promise of significantly improving the ability&#xD;
      to direct biopsies to regions of a much higher likelihood for being malignant. In addition,&#xD;
      the system is capable of guiding local treatment such as Cryotherapy or Brachytherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The integrated MRI-TRUS system resembles a state-of-the-art, high-end ultrasound system. The&#xD;
      MR-TRUS probe is connected to a cart based console, which houses the electronics hardware&#xD;
      required for both MR and ultrasound activation. An investigational device will be&#xD;
      manufactured, handled, and stored in accordance with applicable good manufacturing practice&#xD;
      (GMP). It will be used in accordance with the approved protocol. Procedures that assure the&#xD;
      quality of every aspect of the trial will be implemented.&#xD;
