  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Malignant gliomas, which include Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), are the most common and most&#xD;
      aggressive types of brain cancer, accounting for approximately 60% of primary brain tumors.&#xD;
      These tumors are characterized by diverse molecular abnormalities (within the same tumor),&#xD;
      which, along with the difficulties of many standard chemotherapies crossing the blood&#xD;
      barrier, contribute to the very poor response to therapy and poor survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We recently showed that Dichloroacetate (DCA, an inhibitor of the mitochondrial pyruvate&#xD;
      dehydrogenase kinase) was able to depolarize cancer (but not normal) mitochondria and induce&#xD;
      apoptosis in cancer but not normal tissues. We believe that altering the metabolism of&#xD;
      cancers like glioblastoma (DCA switches metabolism from the cytoplasmic glycolysis to the&#xD;
      mitochondrial glucose oxidation) we inhibit the resistance to apoptosis that characterizes&#xD;
      cancer. Because metabolism (i.e. glycolysis) is the end result of many and diverse molecular&#xD;
      pathways, the effects of DCA might be positive in cancers with diverse molecular backgrounds.&#xD;
      DCA is also a very small molecule that readily crosses the blood brain barrier. Therefore we&#xD;
      hypothesize that DCA will be an effective and relative non-toxic potential therapy for&#xD;
      malignant gliomas.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We are conducting a phase II trial with 2 parallel arms: a) patients with newly diagnosed&#xD;
      malignant gliomas and b) patients with recurrent gliomas or gliomas that have failed standard&#xD;
      therapy (which includes surgery, radiotherapy and chemotherapy). All patients need to have a&#xD;
      histological diagnosis. DCA will be given orally and patients will be followed for a minimum&#xD;
      of 6 months. The tumor size will be followed by standard MRI or CT criteria and glucose&#xD;
      uptake (a direct effect of DCA on the tumor) will be measured by FDG-PET imaging. Several&#xD;
      clinical parameters and quality of life will be followed. Potential toxicity (particularly&#xD;
      peripheral neuropathy) will be closely followed and dose-de-escalation protocols are in place&#xD;
      in case of toxicity. In addition, escape protocols for the application of standard therapy&#xD;
      (when appropriate) are in place in patients with no evidence of response to DCA. In vitro&#xD;
      studies will be performed in the tissues obtained at the time of surgery (where appropriate)&#xD;
      and correlated prospectively with clinical data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is limited ability to accept patients outside of Alberta; this is in part because the&#xD;
      visit and testing schedule is intense, requiring residence in Edmonton for at least 6 months.&#xD;
