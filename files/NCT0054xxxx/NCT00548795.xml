  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a severe lung condition that can result from a&#xD;
      bacterial infection in the lungs. Viral infections may impair the body's immune system&#xD;
      response to bacteria, which may lead to more serious lung injury. This study will evaluate&#xD;
      the association between the immune response and ARDS severity in people who have ARDS plus a&#xD;
      viral infection.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      ARDS is a serious condition that involves inflammation and fluid accumulation in the lungs,&#xD;
      leading to low blood oxygen levels and breathing failure. It is often fatal and affects&#xD;
      approximately 150,000 individuals each year in the United States. Common underlying causes&#xD;
      include bacterial infections, lung trauma, and pneumonia. Even in people with similar risk&#xD;
      factors for ARDS, there are often varying levels of condition severity. This may be because&#xD;
      some people experience an ongoing viral infection that further predisposes them to the&#xD;
      bacterial infection, worsening the severity of ARDS. Viruses release a protein called Type I&#xD;
      interferon. This protein increases the response of the interferon stimulated genes (ISG) in&#xD;
      neutrophils, which are white blood cells that protect the body against disease and infections&#xD;
      by destroying bacteria. Preliminary studies have shown that some people at risk for ARDS have&#xD;
      elevated ISGs in their neutrophils and that ISGs are associated with an impaired neutrophil&#xD;
      response and increased severity of ARDS. This study will evaluate the association between&#xD;
      viral-related neutrophil ISG response and the severity of ARDS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will include people on mechanical ventilation who are enrolled in either the&#xD;
      ARDSNet 06 or 07 studies. For this study, participants will undergo blood collection within&#xD;
      48 hours of beginning the main ARDSNet study. There will be no study visits specifically for&#xD;
      this study. Study researchers will analyze participants' blood samples and ARDSNet study data&#xD;
      to gather information on mortality, the number of ventilator-free days, markers of severity&#xD;
      of organ dysfunction and inflammation, and neutrophil response.&#xD;

             Injury [ALI] or Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome [ARDS]) and ARDSNet Study 07&#xD;
             (Prospective, Randomized, Multi-center Trial of Initial Trophic Enteral Feeding&#xD;

             Full-Calorie Enteral Feeding in Patients with Acute Lung Injury [ALI] or Acute&#xD;
             Respiratory Distress Syndrome [ARDS] and Prospective, Randomized, Blinded,&#xD;
             Placebo-controlled, Multi-center Trial of Omega-3 Fatty Acid, Gamma-Linolenic Acid,&#xD;
             and Anti-Oxidant Supplementation in the Management of Acute Lung Injury [ALI] or Acute&#xD;
             Respiratory Distress Syndrome [ARDS]) will be eligible for co-enrollment in this study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Experiences acute onset of each of the following criteria within a 24-hour time&#xD;
             period:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Partial pressure of oxygen in arterial blood/fraction of inspired oxygen&#xD;
                  (PaO2/FiO2) less than or equal to 300; if altitude is greater than 1000 meters,&#xD;
                  then PaO2/FiO2 must be less than or equal to 300 x (barometric pressure [PB]/760)&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Bilateral infiltrates consistent with pulmonary edema on frontal chest&#xD;
                  radiograph. The infiltrates may be patchy, diffuse, homogeneous, or asymmetric.&#xD;
&#xD;
