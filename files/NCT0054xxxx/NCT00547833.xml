    <textblock>
      Children with language-learning disabilities (LLD) have language and reading skills that are&#xD;
      weaker than those of typically developing children. In the school-age years, reading is a&#xD;
      primary means of exposure to new vocabulary for typically developing children. Although these&#xD;
      children would not be expected to master a new word through a single exposure to it in text,&#xD;
      children show evidence of partial word knowledge growth (e.g., Wagovich &amp; Newhoff, 2004). The&#xD;
      purpose of this project is to characterize the partial word knowledge growth of children with&#xD;
      LLD, in comparison to children with typical language skills. Five forms of partial word&#xD;
      knowledge (e.g., orthographic, word discrimination, syntactic, emotional content, and general&#xD;
      semantic domain knowledge) are being measured. The study's hypotheses are that children with&#xD;
      LLD, like typically developing peers, will demonstrate partial word knowledge growth from&#xD;
      exposure to unfamiliar words in text, but that they will show a different pattern of growth&#xD;
      across the five forms of partial word knowledge being assessed.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this line of research is to examine the process by which children acquire&#xD;
      partial meanings of unfamiliar words when they encounter the words for the first time in&#xD;
      reading.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed pilot study requires 6th grade children to attend three, 1-hour sessions, 2-3&#xD;
      days apart. The protocol for the present study is as follows: In the first session, the&#xD;
      parents of the children will complete a consent form and a parent questionnaire; the children&#xD;
      will complete an assent form, similar to the consent but with simpler language. Next, one&#xD;
      half of the children will complete two pre-tests: a checklist and a multiple choice test; the&#xD;
      other half will complete the checklist and a distracter task. In the second session, the&#xD;
      children will read 2 of 4 possible stories, grade-appropriate in reading level and content.&#xD;
      After reading each story, the children will be asked to write a one-page summary of the&#xD;
      story. In the third session the children will all complete the checklist and multiple choice&#xD;
      measure. These measures, as post-tests, are designed to assess the types of word knowledge&#xD;
      children accrue when they read an unfamiliar word in a story.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of the proposed pilot study, then, is to assess the adequacy of the multiple&#xD;
      choice measure, which is newly developed, for word knowledge measurement. In addition, the&#xD;
      study will assess whether the group who received the multiple choice measure before reading&#xD;
      the stories performs better on the posttests than the children who received only the&#xD;
      checklist in the pretest phase. In sum, then, the purposes of the pilot are (a) to assess the&#xD;
      adequacy of the new multiple choice measure for detecting word knowledge, and (b) to assess&#xD;
      the adequacy of the design, prior to conducting the large-scale experiment later.&#xD;
