  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Coronary CT angiography (CCTA) offers great promise as a risk stratification tool in patients&#xD;
      with suspected CAD. It has been demonstrated in a multitude of accuracy studies to have a&#xD;
      negative predictive value averaging over 95%. This leads to the hypothesis that a negative&#xD;
      CCTA may preclude the need for invasive testing. The purpose of this randomized controlled&#xD;
      study is to prospectively evaluate the role of CCTA on the management of patients with&#xD;
      inconclusive or indeterminate stress test results.CCTA is able to provide not only&#xD;
      information on presence and extent of coronary artery calcification, but detailed coronary&#xD;
      anatomy as well.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SPECIFIC AIM # 1: To evaluate the diagnostic and prognostic performance of CCTA in patients&#xD;
      with equivocal / intermediate stress test results as compared to conventional invasive&#xD;
      coronary angiography.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SPECIFIC AIM # 2: To evaluate the utility of CCTA in prediction of major adverse cardiac&#xD;
      events (MACE) compared to invasive coronary angiography at 30 days, 1 year, 3 years and 5&#xD;
      years.&#xD;

      Outpatients scheduled to undergo cardiac catheterization and coronary angiography for the&#xD;
      specific indication of inconclusive or indeterminate stress tests will be considered for this&#xD;
      study. Patients will be initially screened by their cardiologist for the presence of&#xD;
      inclusion/exclusion criteria, as well as pre-test and post-test likelihood of CAD.16, 17 All&#xD;
      patients must have undergone a stress (exercise or pharmacologic) test within the past 3&#xD;
      months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After consent, patients will be randomized 1:1 to undergo CCTA or cardiac catheterization.&#xD;
      The decision whether or not to proceed with subsequent invasive cardiac catheterization (CCTA&#xD;
      arm) or revascularization (catheterization arm) will be made by the patient's primary and&#xD;
      interventional cardiologists respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Chest pain or other symptoms suggestive of coronary artery disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Pharmacologic/exercise stress test with SPECT (nuclear myocardial-heart perfusion&#xD;
           imaging) within the past 3 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. &quot;Discordant or conflicting findings&quot; clinical and stress results as outlined above.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Scheduled to undergo cardiac catheterization.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Able to provide informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Age equal to or greater than 18 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Presence of pre-existing heart disease (prior heart attack, prior angiographic evidence&#xD;
           of significant heart disease, prior heart surgery) or cardiomyopathy (ejection fraction&#xD;
           less than or equal to 45%)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. History of high blood pressure with severe left ventricular hypertrophy (thicken heart&#xD;
           muscle), history of cor pulmonale (right heart chamber failure due to elevated blood&#xD;
           pressures in the arteries delivering blood to the lungs).&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Kidney insufficiency (creatinine greater than or equal to 1.6) or kidney failure&#xD;
           requiring dialysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Inability or refusal to provide informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Psychological unsuitability or extreme claustrophobia (fear of closed in spaces).&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Pregnancy or unknown pregnancy status.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Age less than 18 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. Patients with known allergy to iodinated contrast, unable to tolerate pre-medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
        9. Inability to tolerate beta-blockers (medication to slow the heart rate), including those&#xD;
           with COPD or asthma requiring maintenance inhaled bronchodilators or steroids, complete&#xD;
           heart block, second-degree atrioventricular block.&#xD;
&#xD;
       10. Computed tomography imaging, or contrast administration, within the past 48 hours.&#xD;
