      The purpose of this study was to assess the effect of soluble fiber® (partially hydrolyzed&#xD;
      guar gum) supplementation on hypertriglyceridemia and immune profile in HIV-positive&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Since 1996, the advent of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) has caused a profound&#xD;
      impact on the natural history of HIV-infection by promoting important and sustainable viral&#xD;
      replication suppression and increasing survival and quality of life among seropositive&#xD;
      patients. Nonetheless, antiretroviral therapy has been observed to be accompanied by&#xD;
      metabolic alterations such as dyslipidemia, especially hypertriglyceridemia, insulin&#xD;
      resistance, hyperglycemia and lipodystrophy (body fat redistribution). Epidemiological&#xD;
      studies have demonstrated a correlation between high triglyceride (TG) levels and higher&#xD;
      incidence of coronary artery disease (CAD). Some investigators suggest dietary intervention&#xD;
      as part of hyperlipidemia treatment, including an increase in soluble fiber intake&#xD;
      (10-25g/day). Whereas some studies have demonstrated that both cholesterol and serum&#xD;
      triglyceride levels decrease with the use of food fiber, others have shown just a serum&#xD;
      triglyceride increase, and others failed to observe any alteration in lipid metabolism. The&#xD;
      purpose of this study was to assess the effect of soluble fiber® (partially hydrolyzed guar&#xD;
      gum) supplementation on hypertriglyceridemia and immune profile in HIV-positive individuals&#xD;
      on HAART. Nineteen HIV-positive individuals with hypertriglyceridemia (serum levels ≥ 200 to&#xD;
      ≤ 500 mg/dL) were studied. Of these individuals, 63.16% were males (mean age of 38.52±9.29&#xD;
      years) who had been on the same HAART regimen for at least 6 months, had no change in therapy&#xD;
      during the study and received 20g/day of soluble fiber for 4 months at pre-established times.&#xD;
      Clinical-nutritional, biochemical (total proteins, albumin, globulin, total cholesterol,&#xD;
      LDL-c, HDL-c, TG, TG/HDL-c and LDL-c/HDL-c), hemoximetric (hemoglobin, hematocrit and total&#xD;
      lymphocytes), and immunologic (lymphocytes T CD4+, T CD8+; T CD4+/CD8+ ratio, viral load,&#xD;
      TNFα- and IL-6) parameters were assessed in all patients at three time points&#xD;
      (M0-pretreatment, M1-30 days and M2-4 months after intervention). Significance level was set&#xD;
      5% for all data statistically analyzed. Serum TG and TG/HDL-c ratio reduction was observed at&#xD;
      all time points, but statistical significance was found just at M0 and M2. The remaining&#xD;
      biochemical, hemoximetric and immunologic parameters (lymphocytes T CD4+, T CD8+; T CD4+/CD8+&#xD;
      ratio, and viral load) showed no significant difference at all times. Regarding serum&#xD;
      cytokines, TNFα- and IL-6 significantly decreased between M0 and M2, and only IL-6 reduced&#xD;
      between M1 and M2. The data collected show that dietary and anthropometric parameters&#xD;
      remained unchanged excluding potential confounding factors related with the effect of fiber&#xD;
      supplementation on serum TG, TNFα- and IL-6. Thus, soluble fiber® (partially hydrolyzed guar&#xD;
      gum) contributed to an important reduction in hypertriglyceridemia and in the serum levels of&#xD;
      the proinflammatory cytokines TNFα- and IL-6 in HIV-seropositive individuals on HAART. In&#xD;
      addition, soluble fiber® (partially hydrolyzed guar gum) might have minimized the process of&#xD;
      atherosclerosis in these individuals, given that elevated serum levels of TG, TNFα- and IL-6&#xD;
      have been associated with the development of these lesions.&#xD;
