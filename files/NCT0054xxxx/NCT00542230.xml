    <textblock>
      This study will collect representative blood samples from healthy children and adults and&#xD;
      from children and adults who have unique red blood cell features that are related to sickle&#xD;
      cell disease. Sickle cell disease is a blood disease that limits the ability of red blood&#xD;
      cells to carry oxygen throughout the body. The purpose of the study is to collect a variety&#xD;
      of blood samples that may then be used to investigate advances and potential new drug&#xD;
      treatments for sickle cell disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Volunteers must be at least 18 years of old. Samples will be taken both from healthy&#xD;
      volunteers and from volunteers who have unique red blood cell features that are related to&#xD;
      sickle cell disease. Candidates will be screened with a medical history.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the study, participants will undergo a one- to two-hour outpatient procedure at the&#xD;
      National Institutes of Health Clinical Center. Once researchers have explained the study and&#xD;
      obtained the participant s consent, participants will donate 8 cc (approximately 2 teaspoons)&#xD;
      of blood.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Because repeat testing helps researchers validate study findings, participants who have the&#xD;
      unique red blood cell features mentioned above may also be asked if they are willing to&#xD;
      return and donate another 2 cc to 8 cc of blood for additional studies. The amount of blood&#xD;
      drawn will not exceed 50 ml with any eight-week period for adults or 7 cc within any six-week&#xD;
      period for children.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The critical event leading to serious morbidity in sickle cell disease is polymerization of&#xD;
      the abnormal hemoglobin to form fibers that stiffen and distort red blood cells and&#xD;
      consequently, cause vaso-occlusion in the small vessels of the tissues. Currently,&#xD;
      hydroxyurea is the only approved drug for treating sickle cell disease, but is only partially&#xD;
      effective. This protocol seeks to identify by high sensitivity in vitro screening methods&#xD;
      additional compounds that inhibit sickling. Subjects with sickle cell trait or disease and&#xD;
      normal volunteers will be asked to donate blood samples for studies to verify their&#xD;
      hemoglobinopathies and then periodically donate small volume samples of fresh blood for use&#xD;
      in ongoing high throughput screening tests to identify potentially clinically useful&#xD;
      anti-sickling drugs.&#xD;
