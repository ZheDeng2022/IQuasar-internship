  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will test the effects of insulin resistance on atherosclerosis (hardening of the&#xD;
      arteries) in women who have systemic lupus erythematosus, more commonly known as lupus. Women&#xD;
      with lupus have a higher chance of developing atherosclerosis than the general population,&#xD;
      and as a result are more susceptible to heart attack and stroke. Insulin resistance is a&#xD;
      particular risk factor for atherosclerosis, and recent small studies have shown that insulin&#xD;
      resistance is more common in lupus patients than in those without lupus. The study will&#xD;
      consist of a series of tests designed to assess whether there is an association between&#xD;
      insulin resistance and atherosclerosis in women with lupus. This research may lead to further&#xD;
      studies on possible treatments to reduce the risk of heart disease in lupus patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Volunteers must be women between 30 and 55 years of age who were diagnosed with lupus within&#xD;
      five or more years prior to the study. Volunteers who have kidney failure, diabetes, or&#xD;
      existing atherosclerosis will be excluded from the study, as will volunteers who have had&#xD;
      pulse steroid therapy within four weeks of the testing or who have been pregnant within one&#xD;
      year of the testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will undergo the following procedures on an outpatient basis:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood and urine tests for research purposes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Electrocardiogram (EKG) to test the general health of the heart.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Oral glucose tolerance test to measure blood glucose and insulin levels. This test is&#xD;
           commonly used to diagnose diabetes and pre-diabetic insulin resistance.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cardiac multidetector computed tomography (MDCT) to determine the amount of calcium&#xD;
           present in coronary arteries. This test is used to diagnose atherosclerosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Carotid artery ultrasound to show the speed of blood flow through the carotid arteries.&#xD;
           This test will show abnormalities and/or blockages in the carotid arteries.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Abdominal ultrasound to determine if the participant has hepatic steatosis ( fatty liver&#xD;
           ), which is often found in individuals with insulin resistance and diabetes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Carotid artery magnetic resonance imaging/angiogram (MRI/MRA) to measure the thickness&#xD;
           of blood vessels. This test is used to diagnose atherosclerosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Abdominal MRI to estimate abdominal fat.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Volunteers may be asked to participate in an MRI/MRA study to evaluate the arteries of the&#xD;
      heart. This test is optional and not required by the insulin resistance/atherosclerosis&#xD;
      study. The entire series of procedures will require one to three visits to complete.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Women with lupus have a five- to ten-fold increased risk of coronary heart disease compared&#xD;
      to the general population. Several decades ago, when women with lupus died shortly after&#xD;
      developing the disease, their deaths were attributed to previously undiagnosed and untreated&#xD;
      active lupus. But when they died years after their diagnosis of lupus, their deaths were&#xD;
      attributed to complications of atherosclerosis (hardening of the arteries). Similar to lupus,&#xD;
      atherosclerosis is considered an inflammatory disease. Inflammation plays a major role in&#xD;
      atherosclerosis, which results when fatty deposits, cholesterol and other materials&#xD;
      accumulate in the blood vessels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The combination of atherosclerosis and lupus greatly increases the risk of cardiovascular&#xD;
      disease among women. Research has identified many factors that contribute to the risk of&#xD;
      atherosclerosis in people with lupus. These include high blood pressure and abnormal&#xD;
      cholesterol levels, chronic inflammation, antibodies that attack proteins that regulate the&#xD;
      blood vessels, and some medications used to treat lupus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the general population, diabetes is an important risk factor for atherosclerosis. A silent&#xD;
      condition called insulin resistance can lead to diabetes and has been associated with&#xD;
      atherosclerosis in populations that do not have lupus. Recent studies have shown people with&#xD;
      lupus are more likely to have insulin resistance than those without the disease.&#xD;
