  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the visual outcomes and patient satisfaction after&#xD;
      implantation of a toric IOL in patients with predicted residual corneal astigmatism between&#xD;
      0.75 and 1.00 D.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cataract is prevalent throughout the world and IOLs are routinely implanted after the&#xD;
      extraction of the cataractous lens. It is the most frequently performed surgery in the United&#xD;
      States with an estimated 2-3 million procedures performed annually. With the aging population&#xD;
      on the rise, as well as the increasing popularity of refractive intraocular lenses, the&#xD;
      number of intraocular surgeries continues to rise. Over the years, the surgical technique has&#xD;
      evolved from intracapsular extraction to modern phacoemulsification. This development has&#xD;
      helped with the evolution of IOLs as well. The IOLs have advanced extensively: different&#xD;
      materials and designs are available, permitting implantation through smaller, sutureless&#xD;
      incisions. Traditional IOLs are of monofocal design providing vision at one distance,&#xD;
      typically far; and correct mainly the spherical component of the refractive error. However,&#xD;
      there are patients with corneal astigmatism that require additional surgical treatment such&#xD;
      as laser correction (laser in situ leratomileusis, LASIK; photorefractive keratectomy, PRK)&#xD;
      or limbal relaxing incisions, RLI). Another alternative is the use of a toric IOL, which has&#xD;
      been especially designed to correct both the sphere and the astigmatism. The ACRYSOF Toric&#xD;
      IOL is intended for primary implantation in the capsular bag of the eye for visual correction&#xD;
      of aphakia and preexisting comeal astigmatism in adult patients with or without presbyopia,&#xD;
      who desire improved uncorrected distance vision, reduction of residual refractive cylinder&#xD;
      and increased spectacle independence for distance vision.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The treatment selection of the corneal astigmatism depends on the amount of cylinder as&#xD;
      follows, between 0.25 and 0.75 D creating the surgical incision on the steep axis; between&#xD;
      0.75 and 1.75 D, RLI; between 1 and 2.25 D, toric IOLs; and between 1 and 3.00 D, LASIK/PRK.&#xD;

&#xD;
           2.3. Surgical Exclusion Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;

           nonevaluable based on medical evidence that indicates the patient is unsuitable for the&#xD;
           trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. STUDY ENROLLMENT PROCEDURES Subjects will be recruited from the corneal and anterior&#xD;
           segment clinic at Storm Eye Institute and satellite offices. Once identified as a study&#xD;
           candidate, the patient will be asked if he/she would like to participate. A study&#xD;
           coordinator or one of the investigators will answer any and all questions and will&#xD;
           obtain informed consent. The patient will understand that participation in the study&#xD;
           will not affect their quality of care.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. STUDY INTERVENTION The Acrysof toric SN60T3 IOL is approved by the Food and Drug&#xD;
           Administration (FDA).&#xD;
&#xD;
           The examinations and treatments used in this protocol are similar to those used in&#xD;
           routine practice. Therefore, the additional risks involved in this study are extremely&#xD;
           low. Patients will undergo routine cataract extraction and intraocular implantation of&#xD;
           the Acrysof toric lens in both eyes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. STUDY VISIT SCHEDULE AND ASSESSMENTS (Table 1) 5.1. Visit Schedule&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be examined at the following intervals:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Visit 1: Preoperative evaluation completed not more than four weeks before surgery&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Visit 2: Date of Surgery&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Visit 3: 14 ± 2 days postoperative&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Visit 4: 30 ±5 days postoperative&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Visit 5: 90 ±7 days postoperative&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Visit 6: 180 ±10 days postoperative Additional office visits as required for medical&#xD;
           safety. On such visits an unscheduled patient visit case report should be completed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      6. MEASUREMENTS AND EVALUATIONS&#xD;
&#xD;
      6.1. Visit 1: Preoperative assessment included a thorough medical history and a complete eye&#xD;
      examination. The latter will include ETDRS uncorrected distance visual acuity (UCDVA),&#xD;
      manifest refraction, ETDRS best corrected distance visual acuity (BCDVA), slit-lamp exam,&#xD;
      manual keratometry, Orbscan, and a quality of vision questionnaire will be evaluated as well.&#xD;
      Informed consent is to be obtained prior to performing the procedures in this study. Patient&#xD;
      must review and sign the documentation. Women of childbearing potential will undergo a&#xD;
      pregnancy test and will only be entered into the trial if this is negative.&#xD;
&#xD;
      6.2. Visit 2: Surgery will be performed by the surgeon under topical anesthesia. A standard&#xD;
      phacoemulsification and posterior chamber lens insertion will be performed according to the&#xD;
      investigator's preferred technique. If a major complication occurs during surgery (e.g.&#xD;
      expulsive hemorrhage or vitreous loss requiring vitrectomy), the patient will be excluded&#xD;
      from the trial. Subjects will be implanted with the Acrysof Toric SN60T3 IOL.&#xD;
      Postoperatively, patients will be instructed to follow the standard of care routinely used&#xD;
      after cataract extraction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      6.3. Visits 3, 4 and 5: On postoperative days 30 ±5, 90 ±7 and 180 ±10, ophthalmic&#xD;
      examination to include: UCDVA, BCDVA, manifest refraction, slit lamp biomicroscopy, IOL&#xD;
      position from slit lamp evaluation, manual keratometry and Orbscan. Absolute residual&#xD;
      cylinder will be evaluated as well as change in axis orientation (determined by the&#xD;
      postoperative manifest refraction), and distance spectacle independence.&#xD;

      7. STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS&#xD;
&#xD;
      7.1. Sample size calculation: This is a pilot study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      7.2. Statistical Method: All data will be collected by the study coordinators. Data will be&#xD;
      entered into an Access database. The database will be password protected and access will be&#xD;
      restricted to study personnel. Data analysis will be performed without patient&#xD;
      identification. Comparisons and statistical analysis will be done to determine if any&#xD;
      statistical differences exist between preoperative and postoperative visits. Statistical&#xD;
      analysis will be done using standard descriptive statistics and other tests as deemed&#xD;
      appropriate based on the distribution of the data. If data is normally distributed, test such&#xD;
      as the t-test will be used, while non-normally distributed data will be analyzed using the&#xD;
      Wilcoxon test for comparison between the groups. ANOVA and Kruskal-Wallis tests will be used&#xD;
      for comparison between baseline and postoperative visits. A P less than 0.05 will be&#xD;
      considered statistically significant.&#xD;
