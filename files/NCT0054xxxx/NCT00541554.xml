    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, open-label study to evaluate the efficacy and safety in reducing&#xD;
      antipsychotic-induced hyperprolactinemia, weight gain, and dyslipidemia by aripiprazole.&#xD;
      Approximate 60 patients will be recruited to achieve at least 40 evaluable patients.&#xD;

      A.Screening / Baseline visit (V1; Day 0) After signing the informed consent form, patients'&#xD;
      DSM-IV multiaxial examination, physical examination, vital sign, pregnancy test, BMI will be&#xD;
      conducted. The demographics, medical history, and concomitant medication will be recorded.&#xD;
      After evaluating all variables obtained, the eligible patients will be enrolled into&#xD;
      study.Patients who fulfill the inclusion / exclusion criteria will be performed the&#xD;
      laboratory tests, PANSS, EPS (AIMS &amp; BARS), menstrual function, sexual function (Arizona&#xD;
      sexual experience scale) and prolaction. Afterwards, the treatment period will be started to&#xD;
      add-on with first medication (7.5 or 15 mg daily by patient, which was prescribed by&#xD;
      investigator) to current antipsychotics at this visit. Besides, drug accounting and adverse&#xD;
      events will also be recorded at this visit. Patients are maintained on current doses of&#xD;
      antipsychotics, and all other medicines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      B.Treatment phase (V2~V3; 2~4 Week finished; 14±3~28±3 Day finished) The vital sign, physical&#xD;
      examination, BMI, laboratory tests (at V3), PANSS, EPS (AIMS &amp; BARS), menstrual function,&#xD;
      sexual function (Arizona sexual experience scale), and prolactin will be carried out.&#xD;
      Concomitant medication, adverse events, and drug accounting will also be recorded at this&#xD;
      visit. Study drug could be titrated with a flexible dose from 7.5 to 30 mg QD. All dose&#xD;
      adjustments should be made with the approval of the investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      C.Completion visit (V4; 8 Week Finished; 56±7 Day finished, or Early termination) The vital&#xD;
      sign, physical examination, pregnancy test, BMI, laboratory tests, PANSS, EPS (AIMS &amp; BARS),&#xD;
      menstrual function, sexual function (Arizona sexual experience scale), prolactin will be&#xD;
      carried out. Concomitant medication, adverse events, and drug accounting will also be&#xD;
      recorded at this visit.&#xD;
