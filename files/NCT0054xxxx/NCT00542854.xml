      Unlike phones, which are commonly held to the ear, music is now available via portable MP3&#xD;
      players and they can be held almost anywhere. Thaker et al state that Apple iPods cause&#xD;
      pacemaker interference in 50% of their patients, with over-sensing in 20% of patients,&#xD;
      telemetry interference in 29% of patients and pacemaker inhibition in 1.2% of patients. The&#xD;
      mean age for their sample was 76.1 years +/- 8.6 years. We anticipate that a higher&#xD;
      proportion of teenagers and children who have pacemakers use portable MP3 players than in the&#xD;
      elderly adult population.We will include the first 100 patients with pacemakers and ICDs who&#xD;
      consent for the prospective observational study a single tertiary care center. We intend to&#xD;
      conduct a descriptive study, tabulating the number of times that a pacemaker or ICD has&#xD;
      changes in the sensing thresholds, pacing thresholds, telemetry interference or pacemaker&#xD;
      inhibition when exposed to a series of portable MP3 players at various distances. In&#xD;
      addition, we will describe the nature and quantitative differences of those changes.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Since pacemakers and implantable cardioverter defibrillators (ICDs) have been used, there&#xD;
      have been questions about what external sources interference could alter their functioning or&#xD;
      event recording properties. Because these devices are often intended to be life-saving, their&#xD;
      proper functioning is of critical importance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The literature documents a number of common sources of possible interference. Interference&#xD;
      with MRI and electrocautery have been observed (1, 2). Outside the hospital, store security&#xD;
      devices and personal digital assistants (PDAs) have been evaluated (3, 4). In 1997, Hayes et&#xD;
      al published a randomized, prospective trial concluding that cellular telephones impacted the&#xD;
      functioning of pacemakers, but that they did not seem to have any effect at any significant&#xD;
      distance (5). They showed that a phone being used at the ear was sufficiently far away to&#xD;
      prevent a health risk and recommended that phones not be put in shirt pockets or used near&#xD;
      the device.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Unlike phones, which are commonly held to the ear, music is now available via portable MP3&#xD;
      players and they can be held almost anywhere. Thaker et al state that Apple iPods cause&#xD;
      pacemaker interference in 50% of their patients, with over-sensing in 20% of patients,&#xD;
      telemetry interference in 29% of patients and pacemaker inhibition in 1.2% of patients (6).&#xD;
      The mean age for their sample was 76.1 years +/- 8.6 years. We anticipate that a higher&#xD;
      proportion of teenagers and kids who have pacemakers use portable MP3 players than in the&#xD;
      elderly adult population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design Prospective observational study a single tertiary care center.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects&#xD;
&#xD;
      The electrophysiology department at Children's Hospital, Boston follows a large number of&#xD;
      patients with pacemakers and ICDs. Approximately 15 patients are seen each week in clinic for&#xD;
      routine pacemaker evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Entry Criteria We will include the first 100 patients with pacemakers and ICDs who consent&#xD;
      for the prospective trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Consent for participation&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Active pacemaker/ICD, which is functioning appropriately at the time of interrogation&#xD;
           based on internal diagnostics and the judgment of an appropriate clinician&#xD;
           (electrophysiology nurse, fellow and/or attending.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Normally functioning leads and thresholds at the time of interrogation based on internal&#xD;
           diagnostics and the judgment of an appropriate clinician (electrophysiology nurse,&#xD;
           fellow and/or attending.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Variables&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Outcome Change in pacemaker sensing thresholds, pacing thresholds, telemetry&#xD;
      interference or pacemaker inhibition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study investigators will first obtain informed consent from each patient or family and, where&#xD;
      appropriate, assent from the child.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the conclusion of their routine clinic visit, each patient will have his or her pacemaker&#xD;
      attached to the appropriate proprietary interrogation system for their pacemaker device. We&#xD;
      will then monitor the pacemaker/ICD system while placing a series of portable music devices&#xD;
      at various distances from the pacemaker/ICD system: (1) 2cm, (2) 30cm, (3) 100cm. At each&#xD;
      distance the pacemaker will be re-interrogated for changes in pacemaker sensing thresholds,&#xD;
      pacing thresholds, telemetry interference or pacemaker inhibition. At the end of the testing&#xD;
      process, the devices will be removed from near the patient and the device will be&#xD;
      interrogated again to assure that the device is at the appropriate clinical settings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Risks&#xD;
&#xD;
      We believe that there are no more than minimal risks associated with this study. The&#xD;
      principle intervention is the placement of a music device near the pacemaker/ICD during the&#xD;
      time of pacemaker monitoring. We consider this risk to be similar to the risks encountered by&#xD;
      many patients who are currently using portable music devices outside the hospital. In&#xD;
      addition, we do not expect any permanent change in the pacemaker or ICD settings, thresholds&#xD;
      or functioning.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Issues&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis Our hypothesis is that the close approximation of portable MP3 players interfere&#xD;
      with the appropriate sensing and recording of pacemakers and ICDs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample Size and Power Calculations We intend to conduct a descriptive study, tabulating the&#xD;
      number of times that a pacemaker or ICD has changes in the sensing thresholds, pacing&#xD;
      thresholds, telemetry interference or pacemaker inhibition when exposed to a series of&#xD;
      portable MP3 players at various distances. In addition, we will describe the nature and&#xD;
      quantitative differences of those changes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Because we do not intend to do comparisons for significance against a control group, we have&#xD;
      chosen 100 patients as a reasonable sample size for evaluating possible changes in&#xD;
      pacemaker/ICD function.&#xD;
