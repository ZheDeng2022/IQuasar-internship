  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Inflammation in the vascular wall is important in atherosclerosis and the blockage of the&#xD;
      artery. The peripheral benzodiazepine receptor is involved in inflammation and in this&#xD;
      protocol we will attempt to take pictures, using PET camera, of inflammation in patients with&#xD;
      atherosclerosis and compare those of healthy people.&#xD;

      Objective&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inflammation in the vascular wall plays an important role in the pathophysiology of&#xD;
      atherosclerosis, including development of plaque, plaque destabilization and rupture.&#xD;
      Clinical and basic scientific data demonstrate the importance of peripheral white blood cells&#xD;
      in this process. Therefore, a noninvasive method to detect inflammatory activity in&#xD;
      atherosclerosis may be of great value to help determine prognosis, direct therapy and perhaps&#xD;
      assess novel therapies for stabilization of atherosclerotic plaque.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The peripheral benzodiazepine receptor (PBR) is distinct from central benzodiazepine&#xD;
      receptors associated with GABAA receptors and has been associated with immune function. PBR&#xD;
      is expressed in macrophages, therefore, they may be a clinically useful marker to detect&#xD;
      inflammation. Our preliminary autoradiographic data demonstrate specific PBR binding in&#xD;
      carotid atherosclerosis samples. Though PBR has been imaged in vivo with positron emission&#xD;
      tomography (PET) using [(11)C]1-(2-chlorophenyl-N-methylpropyl)-3-isoquinoline carboxamide&#xD;
      (PK11195), we developed a new ligand,&#xD;
      [(11)C]N-acetyl-N-(2-methoxybenzyl)-2-phenoxy-5-pyridinamine (PBR28) that shows greater&#xD;
      specific signal than [(11)C]PK11195 in non-human primates.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this protocol is to assess the utility of [(11)C]PBR28 PET to detect&#xD;
      inflammation in unstable atherosclerosis plaques and large vessels with inflammation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population&#xD;
&#xD;
      Twenty patients with carotid atherosclerosis, 20 patients with large vessel vasculitis&#xD;
      including Takayasu's and Giant Cell arteritis, and 20 age-matched healthy subjects will have&#xD;
      one PET scan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design&#xD;
&#xD;
      A [(11)C]PBR28 PET scan and a [18 F] fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) PET scan will be performed in&#xD;
      patients with carotid atherosclerosis. If the patient has endarterectomy after the PET scan,&#xD;
      endarterectomy samples will be evaluated by in vitro autoradiography using [3H]PK 11195 and&#xD;
      immunohistological staining with macrophage markers. Patients with large vessel vasculitis&#xD;
      and healthy subjects will also have a [(11)C]PBR28 PET scan [18 F]FDG PET scan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome measures&#xD;
&#xD;
      Binding of [(11)C]PBR28 in atherosclerotic lesions, aortic arch and its branches will be&#xD;
      compared with the binding in the contralateral carotid artery and those in healthy subjects.&#xD;
      Binding of [(11)C]PBR28 will also be compared with accumulation of [18 F]FDG in each region.&#xD;
      In addition, if the patients with atherosclerosis have endarterectomy, the binding in the&#xD;
      atherosclerotic lesions will be compared with immunohistological staining of macrophage&#xD;
      markers.&#xD;
