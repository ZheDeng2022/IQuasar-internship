      The purpose of this study is to determine how best to manage the sleep problems of people&#xD;
      with Chronic Fatigue Syndrome. This study is being conducted to determine how improvements in&#xD;
      sleep affect other Chronic Fatigue symptoms including pain, fatigue, and mood as well as a&#xD;
      person's sense of general well-being.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (CFS) is a prevalent, debilitating, and poorly understood condition&#xD;
      that contributes to impaired functioning and increased health care utilization. The vast&#xD;
      majority of CFS patients complain of unrelenting sleep disturbances (e.g., sleep onset&#xD;
      insomnia and/or sleep maintenance insomnia) that could exacerbate symptoms such as fatigue,&#xD;
      mood disturbance, and reduced quality of life. Research with normal sleepers and insomnia&#xD;
      sufferers has demonstrated that sleep disruption adversely affects those systems hypothesized&#xD;
      to be important in CFS (e.g., neuroendocrine and autonomic systems). Insomnia appears to be a&#xD;
      perpetuating factor in CFS, as insomnia appears to develop as a comorbid condition that&#xD;
      interacts with and worsens CFS. Perhaps because the insomnia of CFS patients traditionally&#xD;
      has been viewed as a secondary symptom rather than as a comorbid disorder, the sleep-specific&#xD;
      treatment needs of CFS patients have been largely ignored. In fact, there have been few&#xD;
      studies conducted to test sleep-focused therapies with CFS patients. Both our clinical&#xD;
      observations and our preliminary studies suggest that those with CFS display sleep targets&#xD;
      (i.e., increased time-in-bed, decreased daytime activity) that are common to those with&#xD;
      Primary and other comorbid insomnias. These phenomena are known to perpetuate sleep problems,&#xD;
      and likely account for the chronic insomnia among CFS patients. Given the high prevalence and&#xD;
      cost associated with CFS, as well as its complex clinical picture, interventions that&#xD;
      directly address perpetuating mechanisms would likely improve the sleep and general prognosis&#xD;
      for these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed randomized clinical trial will allow us to test the effects of CBT for Insomnia&#xD;
      on sleep and waking functions among CFS patients. Positive results could lead to enhanced CFS&#xD;
      outcomes by treating the comorbid insomnia effectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The consent form for this study will provide participants with information about who will&#xD;
      provide their care during the study, the purpose of the study, the number of participants&#xD;
      expected in the study, what is required of participants in the study, information about&#xD;
      random assignment to study groups, how long participation in the study will last, the risks&#xD;
      associated with the study, possible benefits of participation, alternatives for treatment&#xD;
      other than participation in this study, information about confidentiality, costs to the&#xD;
      participants associated with the study, compensation for participation, and who to contact if&#xD;
      there questions about the study or injuries related to the study, the right to stop&#xD;
      participating and withdraw from the study.&#xD;
