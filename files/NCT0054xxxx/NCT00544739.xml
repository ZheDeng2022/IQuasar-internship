  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cardiovascular risk in women is systematically underestimated by both - society and&#xD;
      physicians. Women younger than 50 years of age with acute coronary syndrome have 2x higher&#xD;
      mortality compared with age-matched men. A number of common vascular-disease-related&#xD;
      conditions are more frequent in women than in men. Women develop a more severe or different&#xD;
      form of vascular disease then men. Variability of onset, relative risk, and the synergy of&#xD;
      traditional and novel risk factors creates a challenge to physicians possibly resulting in&#xD;
      suboptimal management and disregard in women presenting with angina symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During last 10 years the rise in coronary artery disease (CAD) prevalence in younger women is&#xD;
      observed. Emerging data suggest a unique risk profile in women (hypoestrogenemia with adverse&#xD;
      effects of a protracted dysmetabolic state). The risk factors assessment and the risk factors&#xD;
      profiles in women that are associated with CAD may be different than in men and thus merit&#xD;
      reassessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Purpose The primary objective of this study is to determine characteristics and prognosis of&#xD;
      women with premature coronary artery disease and to evaluate the extent of atherosclerosis&#xD;

      • Study Design Single-center, standardized, case-control study designed to assess the&#xD;
      prevalence and significance of novel and traditional risk factors of premature coronary&#xD;
      artery disease in women. Phase I (April 30th 2005- January 1st 2008) enrolled women with&#xD;
      onset of symptomatic coronary artery disease before 55 years of age. The control group of 347&#xD;
      clinically healthy, age matched women was selected from the National Health Survey WOBASZ&#xD;
      study (Polish Multicenter Population Study designed by Epidemiology and Cardiovascular&#xD;
      Disease Prevention and Health Promotion Department of Institute of Cardiology) according to&#xD;
      specifically designed questionnaire for WOBASZ study, and only subjects with negative history&#xD;
      of CVD or negative exertional chest pain were included (Rywik S, Kupść W, Piotrowski W, et&#xD;
      al. Wieloośrodkowe ogólnopolskie badanie stanu zdrowia ludności - projekt WOBASZ Założenia&#xD;
      metodyczne oraz logistyka. Kardiol Pol 2005;63(supl.IV) 605:613).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Definition of premature CAD in women contained onset of coronary artery disease (myocardial&#xD;
      infarction or coronary revascularization) before 55 years of age. Study participants are&#xD;
      enrolled after coronary angiography and after identification and screening the age of&#xD;
      admitted patients for acute coronary syndrome, stable angina or revascularization procedure.&#xD;
      At the time of enrollment, participants give written informed consent for the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Information on demographic factors, social characterization, life style, education,&#xD;
      anthropometric measurements, symptom characteristics and anamnesis, gynecologic history,&#xD;
      family history on CVD and cancer, physical examination data, personal or family history of&#xD;
      CVD, socioeconomic status, cardiovascular assessments and medication used was obtained&#xD;
      through the use of a structured case report form questionnaire (CRF).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additional fasting blood samples (15ml) are drawn from every individual (patients and&#xD;
      controls) and frozen immediately at -70 for genetic study and in patients only half blood&#xD;
      samples are centrifuged, separated, and frozen immediately at -70o after processing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline evaluation consisted of CRF data, and collection of coronary angiography, carotid&#xD;
      ultrasonography and laboratory data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study protocol is approved by the Institutional Review Boards and Local Bioethics&#xD;
      Committee.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Follow-up All patients are contacted at 6 months after discharge from the hospital, and&#xD;
           then every 6 months, for at least 4 years, to assess symptom status, menstrual status&#xD;
           and occurrence of cardiovascular events (MACE) including death, nonfatal myocardial&#xD;
           infarction, coronary revascularization, cardiac surgery and hospitalization for unstable&#xD;
           angina.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Study Endpoints&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Outcome Measures:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To evaluate the prevalence of atherosclerosis risk factors in women with premature CAD,&#xD;
           including family history, social, environmental, clinical, traditional and novel risk&#xD;
           factors, menopausal status and its association with early onset of the disease as&#xD;
           compared to matched controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To evaluate the association of clinical factors to extent and advance of atherosclerosis&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To evaluate predictive role of clinical factors and in particular: impaired fasting&#xD;
           glucose, abdominal obesity, hypertension, metabolic syndrome, inflammatory markers,&#xD;
           coexisting inflammatory and immunologic diseases on prognosis at 1 year and long-term&#xD;
           follow-up in terms of MACE (cardiovascular death, nonfatal MI, revascularization,&#xD;
           hospitalization due to heart failure III/IV or acute coronary syndrome)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Outcome Measures:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To evaluate predictive role of clinical factors and in particular: impaired fasting&#xD;
           glucose, abdominal obesity, hypertension, metabolic syndrome, inflammatory markers,&#xD;
           coexisting inflammatory and immunologic diseases on prognosis in terms of Vascular&#xD;
           Events (MACE, hospitalization due to CAD progression, major arrhythmia, with ICD&#xD;
           implantation, and stroke)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To evaluate predictive role of clinical factors and in particular: impaired fasting&#xD;
           glucose, abdominal obesity, hypertension, metabolic syndrome, inflammatory markers,&#xD;
           coexisting inflammatory and immunologic diseases on prognosis in terms of components of&#xD;
           Vascular Events and total mortality&#xD;
&#xD;
      Endpoints assessment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Independent endpoint classification committee comprising of 2 not involved into study&#xD;
      procedures cardiologists will review documentation of the event and classify it.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study may have significant implications for improvement, identification and management of&#xD;
      female patients at risk of premature atherosclerosis providing more gender-specific data for&#xD;
      efficacy and safety of cardiovascular medication. Better scientific recognition will result&#xD;
      in better awareness of risk and effective prevention of coronary artery disease in young&#xD;
      females, in optimizing the delivery of heart care to population of young women and rationale&#xD;
      for guidelines specific for women.&#xD;
