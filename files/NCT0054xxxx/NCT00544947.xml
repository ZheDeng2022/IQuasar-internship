    <textblock>
      Spinal Administration of opioids offers segmental analgesia, but has side effects including&#xD;
      pruritus, nausea and vomiting, urinary retention, hypotension, and respiratory depression,&#xD;
      both early and delayed. Many Centres in the UK now routinely use supplementation of spinal&#xD;
      anaesthesia from bupivacaine with intrathecal fentanyl or diamorphine. If Fentanyl is used,&#xD;
      this is usually accompanied by connection to a i.v. Morphine patient-controlled analgesia&#xD;
      (PCA)-device in the postoperative period, whereas the use of intrathecal diamorphine seems to&#xD;
      result in a reduction in post-operative morphine requirements, which has obviated the need&#xD;
      for PCA devices in many centres. There has been recent controversy over which opioid is safer&#xD;
      to use with regards to the risk of respiratory depression.1,2 The investigators want to&#xD;
      investigate, whether intrathecal diamorphine causes less or more post-operative respiratory&#xD;
      depression in healthy mothers undergoing elective caesarean section than intrathecal fentanyl&#xD;
      plus post-operative morphine PCA.&#xD;

      Method:&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will use transcutaneous carbon dioxide tension as our primary outcome measure of&#xD;
      respiratory depression. Secondary outcome measures will be the oxygen-saturation, the&#xD;
      respiratory rare, neurological status assessed by Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) and the need for&#xD;
      administration of naloxone and/or active airway management.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PtCO2 and SpO2 will be measured transcutaneously using the Linde TOSCA 500 Monitoring System,&#xD;
      which is a relatively new miniaturized single sensor, that is applied to the earlobe.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There will be 2 study groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group D will be patients at Princess Royal Maternity Hospital in Glasgow, where&#xD;
      supplementation with intrathecal diamorphine 300mcg is the current anaesthetic technique of&#xD;
      choice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group F will be patients at the Queen Mother's Maternity Hospital in Glasgow, where&#xD;
      supplementation with intrathecal fentanyl 15mcg plus post-operative morphine PCA is the&#xD;
      current anaesthetic technique of choice for elective caesarean section.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additional postoperative Analgesia will be given as per local guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will recruit 40 patients to each group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will receive verbal and written information prior to written consent before being&#xD;
      included.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Information Gathering:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The TOSCA monitor will be connected in recovery following the end of caesarean section (with&#xD;
      PCA connection at QMMH). Monitoring will be continuous until 0800hrs the following morning&#xD;
      giving approx. 20 hours data for each patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will then be downloaded to a database for subsequent analysis. We will also note the&#xD;
      total dose of morphine used in each patient and any complications that occurred or&#xD;
      interventions carried out.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We plan to recruit an SHO on each site to help with information gathering.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethics Approval:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethics Approval has been obtained by application to the Research Ethics Committee of the&#xD;
      Glasgow Royal Infirmary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
      For both CO2 and O2 parameters the mean area under the curve (AUC) will be compared between&#xD;
      the diamorphine and fentanyl groups using a normal linear model. This will enable the&#xD;
      analysis to adjust for any demographic and clinical variables, which are known to influence&#xD;
      either of these indicators of respiratory depression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is no previous information in the literature on the variability in area under the curve&#xD;
      for either CO2 concentration or O2 saturation. Any specification of effect size must&#xD;
      therefore be in terms of a number of standard deviations, where the standard deviation is not&#xD;
      known.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We assume that the primary endpoint is the measurement of CO2 over a period of 24 hours and&#xD;
      that this will be quantified in the analysis using area under the curve (AUC). If we compare&#xD;
      the mean AUC between the diamorphine and fentanyl groups using a two sample t-test (with&#xD;
      two-sided significance level 5%) then a study including 40 patients per group would have 80%&#xD;
      power to detect a mean AUC difference between groups of 0.634 standard deviations and 90%&#xD;
      power to detect a mean AUC difference of and 0.851 standard deviations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Final Statistical Analysis will be carried out in cooperation with Dr Chris Weir from the&#xD;
      Robertson Centre for Biostatistics at the University of Glasgow.&#xD;
