  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Treatment of diabetic macular edema with perifoveal focal/grid laser coagulation was found to&#xD;
      be effective saving the visual acuity only in 50% of patients and only 3-14% of treated&#xD;
      patients had an improved visual acuity postoperatively. The decent results of&#xD;
      lasercoagulation are associated with potential side effects, as focal scotomas, change of&#xD;
      color discrimination and development of epiretinal gliosis. The frequency of perifoveal laser&#xD;
      treatments is anatomically limited in case of diabetic macular edema: after application of&#xD;
      about 350 coagulates there is no possibility to repeat the laser treatment perifoveolar&#xD;
      without creating confluent lasercoagulates and causing significant scotomas. In case of&#xD;
      persistence of edema in spite of complete perifoveal grid coagulation, no standard therapy&#xD;
      exists. Some previous studies investigated the effect of steroids in patients with diabetic&#xD;
      macular edema unresponsive to grid laser photocoagulation, but the benefit on the visual&#xD;
      acuity was only temporary and the intravitreal application was associated with significant&#xD;
      side effects as cataract progression (up to 50%) and ocular hypertension (up to 20%).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the Diabetic Retinopathy Study the 4-years rate for severe vision loss in patients with&#xD;
      high-risk retinopathy was 20.4 %. In cases of proliferative retinopathy, panretinal (scatter)&#xD;
      photocoagulation can reduce the risk for development of high-risk retinopathy by 50% over 6&#xD;
      years. When panretinal lasercoagulation is initiated, about 2000 laser spots are equally&#xD;
      distributed in all four quadrants. Since panretinal photocoagulation bares risks like loss of&#xD;
      field of vision, central vision reduction and loss of colour vision, this treatment can not&#xD;
      be continued unlimited.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In cases of persisting neovascularisations in spite of panretinal photocoagulation, no&#xD;
      evidence based therapy exists. There is a high risk for intravitreal bleeding, rubeosis,&#xD;
      secondary glaucoma with severe vision loss. When fibrovascular proliferation leads to retinal&#xD;
      detachment, vitreo-retinal surgery might be indicated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Now we know that vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is the major angiogenic stimulus&#xD;
      responsible for increase of vasopermeability, cellproliferation and angiogenesis in diabetic&#xD;
      retinopathy (DRP). Several studies, evaluating VEGF levels in vitreous, have indicated a role&#xD;
      for VEGF in diabetic macular edema: vitreous samples of patients with diabetic macular edema&#xD;
      contain elevated VEGF concentration and VEGF injected in experimental studies results in&#xD;
      breakdown of the blood-retina barrier.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is increasing evidence for a therapeutic role of anti-VEGF drugs not only in&#xD;
      age-related macular degeneration but also in other diseases as in diabetic macular edema.&#xD;
      Intravitreal injections have become the most favored treatment procedure for administering&#xD;
      anti-VEGF drugs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The side effects and the decent results of laser treatment on the visual acuity in diabetic&#xD;
      macular edema led to studies using anti-VEGF therapy. Unpublished study results on the&#xD;
      aptamer pegaptanib (Macugen™) are promising. A study using the antibody fragment Ranibizumab&#xD;
      (Lucentis™) in patiens with diabetic macula edema is in progress. Ranibizumab is now approved&#xD;
      to be used as an intravitreal injection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently there is one additional anti-VEGF drug already on the market: Bevacizumab&#xD;
      (Avastin™), which has approved as intravenous infusion for the treatment of metastatic&#xD;
      colo-rectal cancer. Previous studies have shown that systemic use of Bevacizumab (Avastin™)&#xD;
      can obtain very promising results on patients with choroidal neovascularisation (CNV) by&#xD;
      age-related macular degenetration. This drug, a monoclonal full-length antibody, designed to&#xD;
      bind all isoforms of VEGF is a large molecule. But case reports in patients with CNV caused&#xD;
      by age-related macular degeneration and with macular edema from central retinal vein&#xD;
      occlusion indicate that intravitreally given Bevacizumab (Avastin™) is effective in diseases&#xD;
      originating from the choroids and the retina, too. These findings imply a sufficient&#xD;
      penetration of the retina by Bevacizumab (Avastin™).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on these new findings and the important role of VEGF in diabetic retinopathy, we&#xD;
      propose a pilot study for treatment of persistent diabetic macular edema or persisting active&#xD;
      neovascularistaions following lasercoagulation with intravitreally administered Bevacizumab&#xD;
      (Avastin™) or Ranibizumab (Lucentis™).&#xD;
