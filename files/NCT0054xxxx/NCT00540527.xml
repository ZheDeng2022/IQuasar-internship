      The purpose of this study is to determine whether intra-arterial rt-PA within 6 hours from an&#xD;
      ischemic stroke onset, compared with intravenous infusion of the same drug within 3 hours,&#xD;
      increases the proportion of independent survivors at 3 months.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      &quot;Stroke is a major cause of death and severe disability.The only effective, available&#xD;
      therapy, within few hours of stroke onset, is rt-PA, a thrombolytic agent. Preliminary&#xD;
      experience but not from properly conducted randomized trials indicates that intra-arterial&#xD;
      treatment might be more effective than intravenous therapy for some vascular lesions.&#xD;
      Intravenous application has not been tested directly against intra-arterial treatment and we&#xD;
      do not known the relative clinical effectiveness with these two routes of administration.&#xD;
      Eligible patients will be randomized to receive either IV rt-PA (0.9mg/kg; max 90 mg), 10% of&#xD;
      which would be infused over 1 minute, and the remainder over 60 min, or IA rt-PA within the&#xD;
      thrombus by means of microcatheter. In patients allocated to IA rt-PA the angiogram is&#xD;
      performed as soon as possible within 6 hours of stroke onset; IV heparin has to be initiated&#xD;
      (2000 U bolus followed by 500 U7hr infusion) and rt-PA is delivered at a rate of about 90&#xD;
      mg/hr for maximum one hour at the dose needed for recanalization up to 0.9 mg/Kg (max 90 mg).&#xD;
      Antithrombotics and anticoagulants are disallowed during the first 24 hours (except heparin&#xD;
      used during the angiogram). After 24 hrs, all patients will be considered for long-term&#xD;
      antiplatelet or anticoagulant therapy. Follow-up will take place at 7 days, discharge, or&#xD;
      transfer, whichever is first; and again at 3 months. 4 centers are currently authorized for&#xD;
      the start-up phase; 15 centers in Italy have applied for an expansion phase of the study&#xD;
      (SYNTHESIS EXPANSION), with financial support from Italian National Agency for Drugs&#xD;
      (AIFA).The two phases of the study will be analysed separately and will be considered in a&#xD;
      pooled analysis.&#xD;

    <description>Endovascular treatment must be performed asap after random.and definitely within 6h from symp. onset.It includes intrarterial thrombolysis with rt-PA,if necessary,associated to or substituted by mechanical clot disruption and/or retrieval.Fibrinolytic therapy should be performed within 1h,the full dose of rt-PA infusion should not exceed 0.9 mg/kg (max 90 mg in the case of body weight ≥100 kg).If a complete recanalization is achieved,rt-PA infusion can be interrupted before reaching the maximum dosage.The option of performing a thrombolysis by mechanical means to obtain a mechanical disintegration/shift/detach/fissure of the thrombus and/or a retraction/aspiration can be considered on the basis of the type,location and characteristics of the occlusion.These choices may involve the use of the microguidewire as a mechanical instrument to favour the disintegration of the thrombus,using systems to capture the thrombus by extraction or more complex systems to crush and aspirate the thrombus</description>
