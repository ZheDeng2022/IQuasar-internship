      Vertical transmission of human papillomavirus (HPV) 6/11 leads to infection in the lower&#xD;
      airway of neonates. The presence of HPV 6/11 may later cause juvenile onset recurrent&#xD;
      respiratory papillomatosis (JORRP).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Juvenile onset recurrent respiratory papillomatosis (JORRP) is caused by human papillomavirus&#xD;
      (HPV), almost exclusively type 6 and 11. The disease is well-known for its recurrence and&#xD;
      difficulty in management. The peak incidence is around 2-3 year of age. Since HPV infection&#xD;
      has always been considered a sexual transmitted disease, the rate of vertical or perinatal&#xD;
      transmission had been studied extensively. However, few studies focused on HPV 6 and 11.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To the best of our knowledge, in the several large-scale studies available for HPV infection&#xD;
      in the newborn, no case of HPV 6/11 infection had been identified. Most of these studies had&#xD;
      specimens taken from the oral cavity of newborn. In contrast to the occurrence of JORRP in&#xD;
      the larynx, trachea and lower respiratory tract, if vertical transmission of HPV 6/11 does&#xD;
      exist, specimens from lower respiratory tract of newborn is mandatory to detect any possible&#xD;
      infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is no study available about HPV 6/11 infection in the lower airway of healthy&#xD;
      neonate/children. In some studies of adults, the prevalence of HPV 6/11 in larynx or vocal&#xD;
      cord of patients without recurrent respiratory papillomatosis ranged between 19~25%. In&#xD;
      contrast, several studies had specimen taken from the non-disease lower airway (trachea,&#xD;
      vocal cord) and/or larynx of patients with JORRP. Except for the almost 100% presence of HPV&#xD;
      6/11 DNA in the diseased site, 38~60% of specimens taken from non-disease site were also&#xD;
      positive for the viral DNA, showing that latent infection is not infrequent in normal airway,&#xD;
      and may later cause active disease by mechanism still unknown to date.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The largest national registry of JORRP to date was conducted in the US and had 603 cases. The&#xD;
      study showed that there was a significant association between younger age at diagnosis and&#xD;
      papillomas occurring below the larynx (mean age 4.6 VS 2.1 years, p=0.009). This finding&#xD;
      further emphasizes the importance of getting specimen at the laryngeal level, especially in&#xD;
      neonates.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of our study is to examine the presence of HPV 6/11 DNA in lower respiratory tract&#xD;
      specimens from newborn. To get the lower respiratory tract specimen without unnecessary&#xD;
      medical intervention, only those needed intubation will be included in this study. Specimens&#xD;
      from bronchial lavage (or scraping?) will be obtained after getting informed consent from the&#xD;
      parents, and undergo PCR to identify the presence of HPV 6/11 DNA.&#xD;
