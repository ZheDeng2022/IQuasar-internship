      The goal of this clinical research study is to find the highest tolerable dose of bevacizumab&#xD;
      (Avastin) and erlotinib hydrochloride (Tarceva) that can be given in combination with&#xD;
      standard radiation therapy and capecitabine before surgery to patients with rectal cancer.&#xD;
      The safety and effectiveness of this combination of therapies will also be studied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goal of this Phase I trial was to determine the maximal tolerated dose (MTD) of&#xD;
      concurrent capecitabine, bevacizumab and erlotinib with preoperative radiation therapy (RT)&#xD;
      for rectal cancer. The trial completed as Phase I without progressing to the Phase II&#xD;
      portion.&#xD;

      The Study Drugs:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bevacizumab is designed to prevent or slow down the growth of cancer cells by blocking the&#xD;
      growth of blood vessels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Erlotinib hydrochloride is designed to block the activity of a protein found on the surface&#xD;
      of many tumor cells that may control tumor growth and survival. This may stop tumors from&#xD;
      growing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Capecitabine is designed to interfere with the growth of cancer cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Phases:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study has 2 parts, called Phase I and Phase II. In the Phase I portion, participants will&#xD;
      be treated with 1 of 4 dose combinations of capecitabine, bevacizumab, and erlotinib&#xD;
      hydrochloride, along with radiation therapy. The dose level of capecitabine and erlotinib&#xD;
      hydrochloride will change during Phase I, but the dose levels of bevacizumab and radiation&#xD;
      therapy is the same for all participants. The first group of participants will be given the&#xD;
      lowest dose combination. If that group does not experience intolerable side effects, the next&#xD;
      group of participants will be enrolled at a higher dose level. This will continue until the&#xD;
      highest tolerable dose level of the study drug and radiation therapy combination is found&#xD;
      (called the maximum tolerated dose, or MTD).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on the results of Phase I, researchers will decide the MTD level of chemotherapy and&#xD;
      radiation therapy. In Phase II, participants will be treated at the MTD dose level. Up to 26&#xD;
      participants will be treated in each phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Radiation and Chemotherapy Administration:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will begin radiation therapy.&#xD;
      The radiation therapy will be given once a day for 5 days in a row (Monday-Friday) each week,&#xD;
      for up to 5 weeks and 3 days. You will have up to a total of 28 radiation treatments. Each&#xD;
      radiation treatment will take about 30 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will take the chemotherapy drug capecitabine by mouth twice a day as a tablet on each of&#xD;
      the days that you receive radiation therapy. These pills will not be taken on Saturday and&#xD;
      Sunday. You must not be taking the drug cimetidine, and must be off of coumadin for at least&#xD;
      1 week and sorivudine and brivudine for at least 4 weeks before starting capecitabine and&#xD;
      during the entire capecitabine therapy. If you are not able to stop taking coumadin, you will&#xD;
      need extra blood tests performed throughout the study to check your bleeding and clotting&#xD;
      speed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will receive the drug bevacizumab by vein once every 2 weeks for 6 weeks (a total of 3&#xD;
      doses). The infusion will at first last 90 minutes. If there are no allergic reactions,&#xD;
      fevers, or chills after the first infusion, the infusion time for the second dose will be&#xD;
      shortened to 60 minutes. If there is no allergic reactions or side effects during the second&#xD;
      drug infusion, the last infusion of bevacizumab will be given over 30 minutes. If you do have&#xD;
      some reactions to the infusion, you may receive extra preventive medications before the&#xD;
      infusion, and the length of time may need to stay at 90 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will take the chemotherapy drug erlotinib hydrochloride by mouth as a tablet once a day.&#xD;
      Your doctor will tell you whether you will take erlotinib hydrochloride during the first 3&#xD;
      weeks of radiation therapy only, or during the whole time you are getting radiation therapy,&#xD;
      up to 6 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Tests&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the study, you will have the following tests performed:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have physical exams once a week.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Every week, blood (about 2 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a routine urine test in the first and third week of radiation therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The possible development of side effects will be closely monitored during weekly visits&#xD;
           with your doctors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At 6-8 weeks after you have stopped receiving radiotherapy, you will have a physical exam,&#xD;
      routine blood tests (about 2 teaspoons), and a urine test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Surgery:&#xD;
&#xD;
      At least 8 weeks after you have stopped receiving radiotherapy, you will have the rectal&#xD;
      tumor removed by surgery. This is considered the standard of care and you will sign a&#xD;
      separate surgical consent document.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Length of Study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will receive radiation therapy with capecitabine, bevacizumab, and erlotinib&#xD;
      hydrochloride for 5 Â½ to 6 weeks. At least 8 weeks after you stop receiving radiotherapy, you&#xD;
      will have surgery. You may then receive additional chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You may be taken off study if the disease gets worse or you experience intolerable side&#xD;
      effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up Testing:&#xD;
&#xD;
      After surgery and possible chemotherapy after surgery, you will be seen by a doctor every 3-4&#xD;
      months for 1 year, and then every 6 months for the next 3 years. You will have blood tests at&#xD;
      these doctor visits. You will also have CT scans within 4-6 months after completion of&#xD;
      chemotherapy then every 6 months for the first 3 years, and then once a year for the next 2&#xD;
      years. These tests are all the standard of care procedures for treatment of colorectal&#xD;
      cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an investigational study. Capecitabine and bevacizumab have been approved by the FDA&#xD;
      for the treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer. Erlotinib hydrochloride has been approved&#xD;
      by the FDA for treatment of pancreatic cancer, but not for colorectal cancer. The combination&#xD;
      of capecitabine, erlotinib and bevacizumab with radiation therapy has not been approved by&#xD;
      the FDA. At this time, this combination is being used in research only.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Update: Nineteen participants were enrolled at MD Anderson for the Phase I portion of the&#xD;
      study then the study was completed December 2013.&#xD;
