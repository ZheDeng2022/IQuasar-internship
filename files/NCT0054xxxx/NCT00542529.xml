    <textblock>
      This study is a randomized, placebo-controlled, dose-escalation, single-center study&#xD;
      evaluating two different doses of Imprime PGG, each in 7 different dosing regimes. A total of&#xD;
      66 subjects will be enrolled into 2 cohorts and, within each cohort, randomized to 1 of 7&#xD;
      treatment groups receiving Imprime PGG or placebo in varied dosing regimens with&#xD;
      granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF).&#xD;

             of acceptable forms of contraception:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Surgically sterile subject or partner (bilateral tubal ligation, hysterectomy,&#xD;
                  bilateral oophorectomy or vasectomy performed at least 6 months prior to first&#xD;
