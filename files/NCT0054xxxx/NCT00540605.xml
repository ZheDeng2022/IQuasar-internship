  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A new approach to HIV prevention currently being studied includes the use of topical&#xD;
      microbicides, substances that kill microbes. The purpose of this study is to determine the&#xD;
      levels of tenofovir, a microbicide in gel form, in HIV uninfected pregnant women who are&#xD;
      expecting to deliver by cesarean.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There is an urgent need for HIV prevention methods that women can initiate and control&#xD;
      themselves. Topical microbicides represent one such method. Tenofovir 1% vaginal gel was&#xD;
      chosen as a high priority microbicide candidate due to its activity in target cells for HIV&#xD;
      infection of the vagina and cervix and the low frequency of local and systemic toxicity&#xD;
      observed in a prior HIV Prevention Trials Network (HPTN) trial utilizing tenofovir 1% gel.&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to assess term pregnancy single-dose pharmacokinetics (PK) of&#xD;
      tenofovir 1% gel in HIV uninfected pregnant women.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The expected duration of participation for individually enrolled participants will depend on&#xD;
      how early they enroll prior to the date of cesarean section, but may range from approximately&#xD;
      3 to 6 weeks. An initial screening/enrollment visit will occur approximately 1 to 4 weeks&#xD;
      prior to the participant's scheduled cesarean section, but no more than 4 weeks before the&#xD;
      delivery date. A targeted physical exam, medical and medication history assessment, blood and&#xD;
      urine collection, and a pelvic exam will occur at screening/enrollment. Tenofovir gel will be&#xD;
      administered vaginally approximately 2 hours before the expected time of cesarean section. On&#xD;
      the day of gel administration and cesarean delivery, a targeted physical exam, medical and&#xD;
      medication history assessment, a pelvic exam, maternal blood tenofovir level measurement, and&#xD;
      collection of placental and endometrial tissues, cord blood, and amniotic fluid will occur.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After gel administration, PK measures will be taken at Hours 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, and 12; maternal&#xD;
      blood tenofovir level measurement and a review of adverse events will also occur at these&#xD;
      times. A 24-hour evaluation will occur between Hours 22 and 26. At this evaluation, a&#xD;
      targeted physical exam, a review of adverse events, and tenofovir level measurement will&#xD;
      occur. Each participant will be contacted between Days 10 and 18 to collect data on any&#xD;
      adverse events they experience. In addition, an unscheduled visit may be necessary if an&#xD;
      unresolved adverse event occurs on or after the 24-hour evaluation. If an unscheduled visit&#xD;
      is required, the participant will undergo a targeted physical exam, medical and medication&#xD;
      history assessment, blood and urine collection, a pelvic exam, and tenofovir level&#xD;
      measurement.&#xD;
