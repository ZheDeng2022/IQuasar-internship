      In order to assess whether the bivalent killed oral cholera vaccine may be used safely among&#xD;
      infants who are most at risk for cholera, the investigators need to determine the safety and&#xD;
      immunogenicity of the killed oral cholera vaccine among infants less than 1 year of age when&#xD;
      given with the expanded program on immunization (EPI) vaccines including diptheria, pertussis&#xD;
      and tetanus (DPT), oral polio vaccine (OPV), Hepatitis B vaccines and measles vaccine.&#xD;
      Furthermore, the investigators also need to make sure that immune interference does not occur&#xD;
      among all the other vaccine antigens given at the same time. Findings from this study will&#xD;
      pave the way for the possible use of the killed whole cell oral cholera vaccine (OCV).&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cholera is an important public health problem worldwide, remaining endemic in most of the&#xD;
      developing world at the same time causing outbreaks in areas where lapses in sanitation&#xD;
      occur.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A monovalent (anti-O1) oral killed cholera vaccine with a B-subunit was developed by&#xD;
      Professor Jan Holmgren in Sweden and is now licensed to a pharmaceutical company in the&#xD;
      United Kingdom. The technology for this vaccine was transferred to Vietnamese scientists at&#xD;
      the National Institute of Hygiene and Epidemiology in Hanoi in the mid-1980s.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Vietnamese developed a bivalent vaccine, with killed 0139 cells and without the&#xD;
      B-subunit. Since licensure, more than 9 million doses have been given without any report of&#xD;
      serious adverse events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The vaccine has been reformulated in order to internationalize the vaccine. Phase II trials&#xD;
      of this vaccine in Son La, Vietnam and Kolkata, India have found the vaccine to be safe with&#xD;
      no serious adverse reactions associated with the vaccine. A phase III study of the&#xD;
      reformulated vaccine is ongoing in Kolkata, India.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The youngest person the vaccine has been administered to was a 1 year old. Previous studies&#xD;
      with the B-subunit containing killed whole cell vaccine was found to be safe among infants as&#xD;
      young as 6 months eliciting significant vibriocidal responses among 53% of vaccinees.&#xD;
      However, no data is available regarding the use of the bivalent whole cell killed oral&#xD;
      vaccine in infants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Due to the higher risk of cholera among infants, the possibility of introducing cholera&#xD;
      vaccine as part of the expanded programme on immunization (EPI) needs to be investigated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data regarding the safety and immunogenicity of the reformulated bivalent killed whole cell&#xD;
      vaccine among infants needs to be gathered in order to pave the way for the possible use of&#xD;
      this vaccine in cholera-endemic areas where infants and children are most at risk.&#xD;
      Furthermore, there is no data regarding the concomitant use of this vaccine with other EPI&#xD;
      vaccines given to young infants such as Diphtheria-Tetanus-whole cell Pertussis (DTwP), Oral&#xD;
      Polio Vaccine (OPV) Hepatitis B and Measles vaccines. It would be important to determine if&#xD;
      interference exists between the killed whole cell vaccine and other antigens included in the&#xD;
      regular EPI schedule. Providing the killed whole cell vaccine in the context of the EPI will&#xD;
      make it easier to introduce cholera vaccines in areas which are cholera-endemic.&#xD;
