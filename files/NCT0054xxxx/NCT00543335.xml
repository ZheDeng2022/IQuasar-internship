    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical research study is to find the highest safe dose of sorafenib that&#xD;
      can be given in combination with radiation therapy to people with lung cancer. The ability of&#xD;
      both the study drug and radiation to control the disease will also be studied.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The Study Drug:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sorafenib is designed to block the function of important proteins in cancer cells. These&#xD;
      proteins, when active, are in part responsible for the growth and behavior of cancer cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Drug Dose Escalation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will be assigned to a study&#xD;
      group based on when you joined this study. Up to 4 groups of 3-6 participants will be&#xD;
      enrolled in the Phase I portion of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Enrolled in the Phase I portion, the dose of sorafenib you receive will depend on when you&#xD;
      joined this study. The first group of participants will receive the lowest dose level of&#xD;
      sorafenib. Each new group will receive a higher dose of sorafenib than the group before it,&#xD;
      if no intolerable side effects were seen. This will continue until the highest tolerable dose&#xD;
      of sorafenib is found.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will receive the same type and amount of radiation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Drug Administration:&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will take sorafenib capsules 1-2 times every day beginning on Day 1 of radiation therapy.&#xD;
      If you are in the first group on study, you will take the study drug 1 time. If you are in&#xD;
      any other groups, you will take the study drug 2 times a day. You will take the study drug&#xD;
      without food (1 hour before or 2 hours after eating).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Radiation Therapy:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before receiving radiation therapy, you will have a &quot;marking session&quot;. At this visit, you&#xD;
      will have a computed tomography (CT) scan that will be used to help to plan out the radiation&#xD;
      therapy. This will take about 45 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before receiving radiation, you will also have a single photon computed tomography (SPECT)&#xD;
      scan of your lungs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will be given 15 radiation treatments, once a day, 5 days a week, Monday-Friday. Each&#xD;
      treatment will take about 30 minutes. You will sign a separate consent form for radiation&#xD;
      therapy and the procedure will be described to you in more detail.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical Visits:&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will have routine clinical visits every week while receiving radiation therapy. The&#xD;
      information collected during these clinical visit will be used for the study. At these&#xD;
      visits, the following tests and procedures will be performed:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a physical exam, including measurement of your blood pressure and weight.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will be asked about any side effects you may be experiencing and any new drugs you&#xD;
           may be taking.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will be asked how well you are able to perform the normal activities of daily living&#xD;
           (performance status evaluation)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 3-4 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have any tests that doctor feels medically necessary&#xD;
&#xD;
      Urine will be collected every week while you are taking sorafenib and receiving radiation&#xD;
      therapy for routine tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Length of Study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will remain on study for 6 weeks after you complete radiation therapy. You will be taken&#xD;
      off the study early if the disease gets worse or intolerable side effects occur.&#xD;
&#xD;
      End-of-Study Visit:&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will have an end-of-study visit 4-6 weeks after you stop receiving radiation. At this&#xD;
      visit, you will have a CT scan to check the status of the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-Up Visits:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Your first follow-up visit will be at 6 weeks (+/- 7 days) after radiation therapy and the&#xD;
      second follow-up appointment will be at 10 weeks (+/- 7 days) after radiation therapy. You&#xD;
      will then have follow up visits every 3 months. At these visits, you will go though the&#xD;
      following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Your complete medical history will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a physical exam, including measurement of your weight and blood pressure.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will be asked how well you are able to perform the normal activities of daily living&#xD;
           (performance status evaluation).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will be asked about any drugs you may be taking.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 3-4 teaspoons) and urine will be collected for routine tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will also have chest x-ray.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a computed tomography (CT) scan of your chest area.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The location, type, and size of all measurable lesions will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If your doctor thinks it is necessary, you will have a positron emission&#xD;
           tomography(PET)/CT scan.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If your doctor thinks it is necessary, you will have an electrocardiogram (ECG -- a test&#xD;
           that measures the electrical activity of the heart).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You may have a lung perfusion scan to see if all regions of your lung are equally&#xD;
           functional or not. This is called lung SPECT scan.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a lung functional test (PFT) if your doctor thinks it is necessary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All these tests are routine examinations as you would have without participating in this&#xD;
      study in order to know the status of the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an investigational study. Sorafenib is FDA approved and commercially available for&#xD;
      renal cell carcinoma. The radiation therapy schedule used for this study is standard&#xD;
      treatment for lung cancer patients. The use of sorafenib with radiation therapy is&#xD;
      investigational.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 64 patients will take part in this study. All will be enrolled at M. D. Anderson.&#xD;
