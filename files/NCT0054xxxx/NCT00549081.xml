  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Approximately 10% of all couples will be diagnosed as infertile. The most efficient&#xD;
      infertility treatment is In-Vitro Fertilization (IVF). One major determinant for success is&#xD;
      production of an adequate number of oocytes (eggs) from the female in order to finally have&#xD;
      good-quality embryos and finally acceptable pregnancy and delivery rates. Some women will not&#xD;
      respond adequately to hormonal stimulation and will only a small number of oocytes.&#xD;
      Therefore, the chances of finally having a successful delivery are significantly reduced.&#xD;
      Although the specific definition of this situation is controversial, these patients are&#xD;
      diagnosed as having &quot;low ovarian response&quot;. This condition is more prevalent in older IVF&#xD;
      patients as part of the reproductive aging process; it is possible at any age. Currently, the&#xD;
      understanding of &quot;low ovarian response&quot; is limited, and although many therapeutic approaches&#xD;
      have been suggested, no treatment has been proven significantly efficient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DHEA is a pro-hormone produced by the adrenal gland and the ovary. DHEA serum levels become&#xD;
      lower with age and in some chronic diseases. Therefore, some believe it may be beneficial as&#xD;
      an 'anti-aging' factor. DHEA pills are available as a food-supplement, without need for&#xD;
      prescription in the US.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DHEA is involved in the regulation of follicular growth in the ovaries. In a 2000 report,&#xD;
      five IVF patients who had low ovarian response were treated with oral DHEA (Casson et al, Hum&#xD;
      Reprod 2000;15:2129). A small increase in the ovarian response to hormonal stimulation was&#xD;
      noticed. Barad and Gleicher reported their relatively extensive experience, summarizing&#xD;
      treatment outcome in 25 IVF low-responders treated with oral DHEA pills (Barad and Gleicher,&#xD;
      Hum Reprod 2006; 21, 2845). They observed increased increases in fertilized oocytes, normal&#xD;
      day 3 embryos, and number of embryos transferred after DHEA treatment compared with a&#xD;
      previous treatment outcome before DHEA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on this observation, DHEA may appear useful for improving IVF outcome in some patients.&#xD;
      However, a prospective randomized study on DHEA supplementation for IVF patients was not yet&#xD;
      published. Our aim is to conduct such a study, focusing on IVF patient with low ovarian&#xD;
      response.&#xD;
