      Rationale: For the treatment of early gastric cancer (EGC) in the distal portion of the&#xD;
      stomach, subtotal gastrectomy and lymph node dissection has been a standard operation. With&#xD;
      the increasing tendency toward minimally invasive surgery, there has been an effort to apply&#xD;
      minimally invasive techniques to the treatment of EGC. Laparoendoluminal mucosectomy and&#xD;
      lesion-lifting gastric wedge resection have been developed for this purpose. However, these&#xD;
      methods have the disadvantage of limited indications according to the size, shape and depth&#xD;
      of invasion. Kitano et al. performed the first laparoscopy-assisted subtotal gastrectomy with&#xD;
      lymph node dissection and manual anastomosis with anterior wall lifting method for a patient&#xD;
      with EGC. In 1995, Uyama et al. and Nagai et al. performed laparoscopy-assisted subtotal&#xD;
      gastrectomy with lymph node dissections using an automatic stapler instead of manual&#xD;
      anastomosis for the gastroduodenal anastomosis. It has been possible to maintain an adequate&#xD;
      distance from the lesion to the proximal and distal margins of resection, to perform radical&#xD;
      lymph node dissection, and to achieve excellent postoperative recovery. However, there is a&#xD;
      very limited evidence of superiority of laparoscopic gastrectomy over open surgery. There is&#xD;
      only one interim report of randomized clinical trial of comparing laparoscopic gastrectomy&#xD;
      and open gastrectomy. A well-designed clinical study to prove the benefit and safety is&#xD;
      definitely needed Objective: to compare Laparoscopy - assisted Distal Gastrectomy (LADG) with&#xD;
      Open Distal Gastrectomy (ODG) in terms of survival, recovery, pain, complications, and&#xD;
      quality of life (QOL) Hypothesis: LADG is beneficial in QOL, pain, recovery, complications&#xD;
      while maintaining equivalent survival with ODG&#xD;

      1. Randomization&#xD;
&#xD;
           Randomization is done by person who is not involved in study. So it is done by the&#xD;
           person in Center for Clinical Trial in National Cancer Center. The patient is enrolled&#xD;
           in the out-patient clinic after getting informed consent of the clinical study from the&#xD;
           patient. Surgeon factor is not considered as a randomization factor because this&#xD;
           clinical study will be performed intramurally. In Center for Gastric Cancer, National&#xD;
           Cancer Center, Surgical techniques and extent of resections are generally standardized&#xD;
           and surgical outcomes are same in terms of complication and recovery.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Follow-up schedule&#xD;
&#xD;
           Patients are followed up in the outpatient department at four weeks, three months, six&#xD;
           months, and twelve months after the operation, and every six months thereafter. On each&#xD;
           visit, history was reviewed and physical examination was done. A complete blood count&#xD;
           (CBC) and serum chemistry were evaluated also. An esophago-gastro-duodenoscopy (EGD) was&#xD;
           performed at three months after the operation and yearly thereafter. Abdominal computed&#xD;
           tomography (ACT) was evaluated annually.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Assessment of QOL The European EORTC QLQ-C30 (version 3.0) questionnaire is a 30-item&#xD;
           cancer-specific integrated system for assessing the health-related QOL of cancer&#xD;
           patients. The questionnaire incorporates five scales of function (physical, role,&#xD;
           cognitive, emotional and social), three symptom scales (fatigue, pain and nausea and&#xD;
           vomiting), a global health and QOL scale, and single items for the assessment of&#xD;
           additional symptoms commonly reported by cancer patients (e.g., dyspnea, appetite loss,&#xD;
           sleep disturbance, constipation and diarrhea), as well as the perceived financial impact&#xD;
           of the disease and treatment. All items were scored on four-point Likert scales, with&#xD;
           the exception of two items in the global health QOL scale, which used modified&#xD;
           seven-point linear analog scales. The EORTC QLQ-STO22 with a 22-item stomach&#xD;
           cancer-specific questionnaire was also used. It incorporates five hypothesized&#xD;
           scales-(dysphasia, eating restrictions, pain, reflux and anxiety) and four single items&#xD;
           (having a dry mouth, body image, taste, and hair loss) covering disease and&#xD;
           treatment-related symptoms and specific emotional consequences of gastric cancer.12 All&#xD;
           instruments of the questionnaire were administered preoperatively and postoperatively at&#xD;
           seven days, 30 days, 90 days and yearly. Those time points were chosen at usual&#xD;
           follow-up schedule for every gastrectomized patients in our institute, to maximize&#xD;
           compliance for the questionnaire, and to compare other parameters at the same time.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Statistical analyses The EORTC QLQ-C30 symptom subscale and the EORTC QLQ-STO22 subscale&#xD;
           scores are reported using a scale from 0 to 100. Statistical analyses of the QOL&#xD;
           outcomes evaluated the differences between the LADG and the ODG groups with respect to&#xD;
           the overall changes from the preoperative scores (baseline) to those obtained at&#xD;
           follow-up. To adjust for possible baseline differences, we included the baseline values&#xD;
           in the model. All comparisons between groups were based on 'intent-to-treat' analyses in&#xD;
           which patients were analyzed according to their assigned treatment group. Categorical&#xD;
           variables were compared using the Ï‡2 test, and continuous variables were analyzed using&#xD;
           the Student's t-test. Analysis of Covariance (ANCOVA) with repeated measures was used to&#xD;
           compare the two groups of patients with respect to overall changes in their short term&#xD;
           quality of life after the surgery. The SAS (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA) program&#xD;
           called 'PROC GLM' was used.&#xD;
