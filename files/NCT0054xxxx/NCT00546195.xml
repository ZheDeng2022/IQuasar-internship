      This study will examine the response of white blood cells to bacterial infection in blood&#xD;
      taken from the umbilical cords of newly delivered infants. The blood samples will be taken&#xD;
      from both male infants who were carried to term and male infants who were born prematurely,&#xD;
      and genetic studies will compare these blood samples to samples drawn from healthy adult male&#xD;
      volunteers. The study is designed to look at the ways in which the immune systems of newborn&#xD;
      infants respond to bacterial infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants in this study will be pregnant Chinese women admitted to the labor ward of the&#xD;
      Prince of Wales Hospital (Sha Tin district of New Territories, Hong Kong SAR) for normal&#xD;
      spontaneous delivery. Those with known blood-borne infectious diseases such as HIV and&#xD;
      hepatitis B will be excluded from this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cord blood and placenta samples will be collected after the completion of delivery. The&#xD;
      samples collected for this study will be restricted to male newborns. A comparison group of&#xD;
      blood samples will be drawn from healthy male adults between 25 and 35 years of age....&#xD;

      Bacterial infection in preterm neonates is a significant clinical problem. Neutrophils play a&#xD;
      critical role in the bactericidal process, which is immature in newborns though their&#xD;
      peripheral blood neutrophil counts are similar to or higher than that of older children and&#xD;
      adults. The use of steroids to enhance lung maturation in premature infants complicates this&#xD;
      problem. Many studies have shown different biological activities between lipopolysaccharide&#xD;
      (LPS) activated neonatal cord blood neutrophils and adult peripheral blood neutrophils. In&#xD;
      spite of a number of previous studies, the genetic basis of this differential response to&#xD;
      LPS-activation remains unknown. In this study, we will identify the differential gene&#xD;
      expression profiles of LPS-activated adult peripheral blood versus cord blood neutrophils&#xD;
      from both term and preterm infants by whole genome ligonucleotide microarray. We will&#xD;
      investigate the priming effect of histologic chorioamnionitis (HCA), a severe&#xD;
      infection/inflammation implicated in many neonatal diseases, on the immune response in&#xD;
      neutrophils in terms of gene expression. The effect of prenatal administration of steroids on&#xD;
      the immune response in preterm neutrophils is another question we will address in the&#xD;
      proposed study. This study will provide insight into the molecular basis for genetic&#xD;
      regulation of neutrophil development. We expect to identify novel genes with differential&#xD;
      expressions in LPS-activated cord blood neutrophils when compared to those of LPS-activated&#xD;
      adult cells. Aberrant transcripts due to the priming effect of HCA to the immune response in&#xD;
      term neutrophils will also provide insight on the defense mechanism of subsequent exposures&#xD;
      to bacterial infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a collaborative study. All samples will be collected by our Collaborators at the&#xD;
      Chinese University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong. We will perform expression profiling in the&#xD;
      Laboratory of Clinical Genomics at NICHD. This protocol has been approved by the Joint&#xD;
      Clinical Research Ethics Committee of the Chinese University of Hong Kong and Hospital&#xD;
      Authority of Hong Kong.&#xD;
