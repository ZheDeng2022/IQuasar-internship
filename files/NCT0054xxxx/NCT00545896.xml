    <textblock>
      Chronic soft tissue wounds represent a difficult problem for patients and doctors as well.&#xD;
      Chronic wounds can be caused by internal and dermatological diseases like venous ulcers as a&#xD;
      consequence of venous insufficiency, arterial ulcers as a consequence of peripheral occlusive&#xD;
      vascular disease, the diabetic foot stemming from diabetes and other pathologies. A different&#xD;
      reason for chronic wounds could be prior traumatic injuries (war wounds, traffic&#xD;
      accidents)not showing a tendency to heal after surgical repair.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary goal in the treatment of chronic soft tissue wounds is to obtain wound closure.&#xD;
      Usually necrotic tissue is debrided, i.e. surgically removed, to assess the full extent of&#xD;
      the damage, to detect underlying abscesses or other pathologies causing the non-healing of&#xD;
      the wound. Wet - to - wet dressings are primarily applied to induce a healing process. As&#xD;
      second line attempts to obtain closure special dressings like semipermeable films, gels,&#xD;
      hydrocolloids and calcium alginates are applied. These expensive dressings are associated&#xD;
      with extended time periods of conservative treatment until closure can be observed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A third line after failure of nonoperative treatment is the application of skin graft. This&#xD;
      involves the operative and anesthesiological risk for an already health wise compromised&#xD;
      patient with little to no physiological reserve. One should not forget that the majority of&#xD;
      patients presenting at outpatient clinics with chronic soft tissue wounds are the elderly&#xD;
      with/without disabling comorbidities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The use of extracorporeal shockwaves (ESW) for clinical applications was introduced in&#xD;
      central Europe more than two decades ago. Extracorporeal shockwave therapy (ESWT)is used in&#xD;
      the fields of urology, orthopedic surgery, trauma surgery. ESW are associated with the&#xD;
      induction of neovascularisation and with mechanical stimuli causing proliferation of a large&#xD;
      number of cells including osteoblasts (Martini L., J Trauma 2006). The exact effects of ESW&#xD;
      on human cells are currently studied in several centers worldwide. The application of ESWT in&#xD;
      the above mentioned fields of medicine proved safe, reliable and almost complication-free.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our center's experience with ESWT in trauma surgery (Schaden W., Clin. Orthop 2001)and the&#xD;
      observation that not only the traumatic condition (fracture non-union, etc.), but also the&#xD;
      surrounding tissue showed favorable tissue healing after ESWT, leads to our hypothesis that&#xD;
      ESWT might be beneficial for the much larger number of chronic soft tissue wounds. The&#xD;
      investigators anticipate to induce complete wound healing in a number of defined&#xD;
      clinical/pathological conditions by ESWT. At the same time efficacy and safety of ESWT will&#xD;
      be investigated.&#xD;
