      The purpose of this study is to compare the effects of fluvastatin, pravastatin,&#xD;
      pitavastatin, and atorvastatin on coronary plaque volume in patients with acute coronary&#xD;
      syndrome, and to clarify the impact of moderate and intensive lipid lowering therapy on&#xD;
      coronary plaque volume, serum lipids, and inflammation markers in patients with acute&#xD;
      coronary syndrome in Japanese.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Previous mega trials have demonstrated that lipid lowering therapy with HMG-CoA reductase&#xD;
      inhibitors (statins) reduces the incidence of major cardiovascular events by one-third, thus,&#xD;
      the benefit of lipid lowering therapy has been substantiated. Such a benefit is significant&#xD;
      especially for patients with coronary heart disease (CHD). The third report of the National&#xD;
      Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel (NCEP ATP-III) has suggested the&#xD;
      advantage of more intensive lipid lowering therapy with a goal of reducing LDL-C below 70&#xD;
      mg/dL for such patients categorized as very high risk. In Japan, Japan Atherosclerosis&#xD;
      Society (JAS) Guidelines for Diagnosis and Treatment of Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular&#xD;
      Diseases 2002 have recommended that an LDL-C goal for patients with coronary heart disease&#xD;
      should be below 100 mg/dL. However, there is no satisfactory evidence whether we need to&#xD;
      lower LDL-C level less than the 70mg/dL or not in Japanese population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently, research on diagnosis of coronary plaque has shown significant advances. The&#xD;
      REVERSAL study in patients with a history of CHD, by diagnosis with intravascular ultrasound,&#xD;
      suggested that intensive lipid lowering therapy with atorvastatin (80 mg/day) was associated&#xD;
      with no growth of plaque (-0.4% compared to baseline), whereas therapy with pravastatin (40&#xD;
      mg/day) showed a slight increase (2.7%) in plaque volume over 18 months in Western&#xD;
      population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Japanese population, MEGA study have shown the effect of moderate lipid lowering therapy&#xD;
      in primary prevention of cardiovascular events. However, the effect of moderate lipid&#xD;
      lowering therapy in secondary prevention of cardiovascular events is unknown.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pravastatin and fluvastatin are the statin which has been administered in Japan for several&#xD;
      years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although LDL-C lowering effect of these statins were less strong than new generation statins,&#xD;
      their safeｔｙ profile have been well established. Fluvastatin were expected to reduce coronary&#xD;
      plaque because of its high affinity to arterial tissue and antioxygenic effect compared with&#xD;
      pitavastatin, but the effect on human coronary plaque has not been reported.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Relative plaque regression rate between intensive and moderate lipid lowering therapy would&#xD;
      clarify the ideal level of target LDL-C in Japanese population. Furthermore, the different&#xD;
      effect on coronary plaque between pravastatin and fluvastatin which have similar LDL-C&#xD;
      lowering effect and different affinity to arterial tissue would determine the superior lipid&#xD;
      lowering regimen to affect coronary plaque volume.&#xD;
