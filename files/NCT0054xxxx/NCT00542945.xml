      Title: A DANish randomized, controlled, multicenter study to assess the efficacy of&#xD;
      Implantable cardioverter defibrillator in patients with non-ischemic Systolic Heart failure&#xD;
      on mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Indication: Prevention of mortality in patients at risk of sudden death.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objective: The primary objective of this study is to determine the efficacy of ICD&#xD;
      therapy compared with control on the endpoint of death from any cause.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objective: The secondary objectives of the study are to determine if ICD therapy&#xD;
      reduces sudden death.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design: Randomized, unblinded, controlled, parallel two group trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary endpoint: Time to death from any cause.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size: In total, 1000 patients with 500 receiving ICD and 500 patients constituting the&#xD;
      control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Summary of Subject Eligibility Criteria: Patients with clinical heart failure, left&#xD;
      ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) ≤ 35%, non-ischemic ethiology and NT-proBNP above 200&#xD;
      pg/ml. Patients in NYHA class IV will only be randomised if also fulfilling criteria for a&#xD;
      biventricular pacemaker.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Control group: Patients receiving standard therapy for heart failure including&#xD;
      ACE-inhibitor/Angiotensin-Receptor-Blocker and Betablocker unless not tolerated. Aldosterone&#xD;
      antagonism is optional.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Duration: The study comprises a screening period of up to 2 years, followed by a&#xD;
      treatment phase of a minimum of 36 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening and Randomisation: After the signing of informed consent, screening will include&#xD;
      medical history, vital signs, physical exam, blood chemistry, haematology, and NT-proBNP.&#xD;
      After fulfilling all eligibility criteria, subjects will be randomized 1:1 to receive ICD&#xD;
      implantation or continue usual control. Randomisation will be stratified according to&#xD;
      treatment with a biventricular pacemaker.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment: After randomisation patients allocated to ICD treatment should receive this as&#xD;
      fast as possible and preferably within 2 weeks (latest 4 weeks). The ICD will be programmed&#xD;
      with anti-tachycardia pacing and shock therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessments: Deaths and hospitalisations for heart failure, stroke or arrhythmias will be&#xD;
      recorded throughout the study duration. An Endpoint Classification Committee will adjudicate&#xD;
      hospitalizations and deaths for causality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An independent Data Monitoring Committee will periodically review mortality data throughout&#xD;
      the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Considerations: Median lifetime in the control group is expected to be 5 years. A&#xD;
      p-value of 5% (2-sided) is required for significance together with a power of at least 80%.&#xD;
      With a relative risk reduction of 25% a sample size of 812 patients in total is required. In&#xD;
      order to allow for cross-over a sample size of 1000 is planned.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Endpoint Analysis: The principal analysis for the primary endpoint (time to death&#xD;
      from any cause) will employ the intent-to-treat principle and use a survival analysis. For&#xD;
      each treatment group, Kaplan-Meier curves will be estimated, graphically displayed, and&#xD;
      compared using a logrank test. A covariate-adjusted analysis of the primary endpoint using a&#xD;
      Cox proportional hazards model will be performed as a supportive analysis. The hazard ratio&#xD;
      and its corresponding 95% confidence interval will be estimated. Subjects withdrawing from&#xD;
      the study early (other than for withdrawal of consent) will be followed for potential&#xD;
      development of the primary endpoint. Subjects completing the study and not experiencing the&#xD;
      composite event will be censored.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Endpoint Analysis: All time-to-event secondary endpoints will be analyzed similarly&#xD;
      to the primary endpoint.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample Size: Hazard rates have been estimated for the placebo and ICD groups using subjects&#xD;
      from a variety of databases (including the Echos database and the publication of Definite).&#xD;
      Assuming a 24-month enrollment period and a 36 month follow-up period (resulting in a 5-year&#xD;
      study with a minimum treatment period of 3 years and approximately a median survival time of&#xD;
      60 months), a total of 812 subjects will provide a 80% power with a 2-sided significance&#xD;
      level of 5% for detecting a reduction in hazard of 25%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety Summary: The subject incidence of adverse events will be tabulated for each group.&#xD;
      Adverse events related to ICD implantation will be summarized. During the trial inappropriate&#xD;
      shocks will be summarized.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Monitoring Committee: An independent Data Monitoring Committee consisting of members&#xD;
      with relevant expertise will be assembled prior to study commencement. This committee will&#xD;
      periodically review safety data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Endpoint Classification Committee: An external Endpoint Classification Committee will&#xD;
      adjudicate death as sudden or non-sudden throughout the study.&#xD;
