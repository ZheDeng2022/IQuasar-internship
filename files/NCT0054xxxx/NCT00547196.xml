      RATIONALE: Giving chemotherapy with or without total-body irradiation before a donor&#xD;
      umbilical cord blood transplant helps stop the growth of cancer or abnormal cells. It also&#xD;
      helps stop the patient's immune system from rejecting the donor's stem cells. When the stem&#xD;
      cells from a donor are infused into the patient they may help the patient's bone marrow make&#xD;
      stem cells, red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets. Sometimes the transplanted&#xD;
      cells from a donor can make an immune response against the body's normal cells. Giving&#xD;
      cyclosporine and mycophenolate mofetil before and after transplant may stop this from&#xD;
      happening.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE: This clinical trial is studying how well four different chemotherapy regimens given&#xD;
      with or without total-body irradiation before umbilical cord blood transplant work in&#xD;
      treating patients with relapsed or refractory hematologic cancer.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the survival at day 100 of patients with relapsed, refractory, or poor-risk&#xD;
           hematological malignancies treated with four different preparative regimens followed by&#xD;
           allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) using two unrelated umbilical&#xD;
           cord blood (UCB) units.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the incidence and timing of neutrophil engraftment in patients treated with&#xD;
           these regimens.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the incidence and timing of platelet engraftment in patients treated with&#xD;
           these regimens.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the incidence and severity of acute and chronic graft-versus-host-disease&#xD;
           (GVHD) in patients treated with these regimens.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the survival at day 180 in patients treated with these regimens.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the disease-free survival in patients treated with these regimens.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the incidence of primary and secondary engraftment failure in patients&#xD;
           treated with these regimens.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the incidence of transplantation-related complications (e.g., infection,&#xD;
           veno-occlusive disease of the liver, or organ toxicity) in these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the incidence of post-transplantation-related lymphoproliferative disease,&#xD;
           secondary myelodysplastic syndromes, or other secondary malignancies in these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the incidence of relapse in patients treated with these regimens.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine post-transplantation chimerism in patients treated with these regimens.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine immune reconstitution in patients treated with these regimens.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Preparative regimens: Patients are assigned to 1 of 4 preparative regimens.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Regimen 1 (for patients &lt; 50 years of age and no contraindication to fractionated&#xD;
                total-body irradiation (FTBI): Patients undergo FTBI 2-3 times a day on days -9 to&#xD;
                -6 for a total of 11 fractions. Patients also receive cyclophosphamide IV over 2&#xD;
                hours on days -5 and -4 and fludarabine phosphate IV on days -5 to -2.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Regimen 2 (for patients &lt; 50 years of age and unable to tolerate FTBI due to prior&#xD;
                dose-limiting radiotherapy or significant cardiotoxicity): Patients receive a test&#xD;
                dose of busulfan on day -10 and then dose adjusted busulfan IV 3-4 times daily on&#xD;
                days -9 to -6, melphalan IV on days -5 and -4, and fludarabine phosphate IV on days&#xD;
                -5 to -2.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Regimen 3* (for patients unable to tolerate regimen 1 or 2; no age exclusion):&#xD;
                Patients receive fludarabine phosphate IV on days -8 to -4 and cyclophosphamide IV&#xD;
                over 2 hours on day -3 and undergo TBI (single dose) on day -2.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Regimen 4* (for patients unable to tolerate regimen 1 or 2): Patients receive&#xD;
                fludarabine phosphate IV on days -7 to -3 and melphalan IV on day -2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      NOTE: *Treating physician decides the choice between regimen 3 and 4&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Umbilical cord blood (UCB) transplantation: Patients receive 2 combined units of UCB IV&#xD;
           on day 0. Patients also receive G-CSF IV or subcutaneously beginning on day 5 (or later)&#xD;
           and continuing until blood counts recover.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Graft-versus-host-disease prophylaxis: Patients receive cyclosporine IV twice daily&#xD;
           beginning on day -1 followed by a taper according to institutional guidelines. Patients&#xD;
           also receive mycophenolate mofetil orally or IV beginning on day 0 and continuing until&#xD;
           day 27 (or as clinically indicated).&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed periodically.&#xD;
