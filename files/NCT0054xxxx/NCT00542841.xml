  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) is a genetic disorder that affects the amount of&#xD;
      steroids that the body forms. The most common form of CAH is 21-hydroxylase deficiency&#xD;
      (21OHD), which leads to cortisol deficiency. This, in turn, causes the development of mature&#xD;
      masculine characteristics in newborn, prepubescent, and grown females and in prepubescent&#xD;
      males. 21OHD is known to be caused by the mutation of a specific gene. However, symptom&#xD;
      severity among people with 21OHD varies, and adults seem to be less affected than children.&#xD;
      This study will examine participants' DNA to determine what other genes may affect the&#xD;
      severity of 21OHD and may make the disease milder in adults than in children.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      CAH is a genetic steroidogenesis disorder. The most common form, 21OHD, leads to cortisol&#xD;
      deficiency and, in turn, an excess of androgen, a hormone that promotes the development and&#xD;
      maintenance of male sex characteristics. As a result of this androgen excess, prepubescent&#xD;
      males and newborn, prepubescent, and grown females exhibit mature masculine characteristics.&#xD;
      The symptoms and severity of 21OHD vary among individuals with the disease and in adults&#xD;
      versus children. The reasons for these differences are not yet known. Current therapy for&#xD;
      21OHD consists of administration of glucocorticoids to replace cortisol and suppress&#xD;
      excessive pituitary function. With more information about what genes or factors contribute to&#xD;
      the severity of 21OHD, researchers may be able to better treat children and adults with the&#xD;
      disease. This study will examine participants' DNA to determine what other genes may affect&#xD;
      the severity of 21OHD and may make the disease milder in adults than in children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      People interested in participating in this 3-day inpatient study will first undergo a&#xD;
      physical exam and provide a blood sample to determine eligibility. Eligible participants will&#xD;
      be admitted to the study site in the morning on the first study day. A blood sample will be&#xD;
      taken and participants will receive one 10-mg pill of hydrocortisone. Heart rates and blood&#xD;
      pressures will be taken every 4 hours throughout the day. In the morning of Day 2, a blood&#xD;
      sample will be taken and participants will be asked to urinate in the toilet. After this&#xD;
      point and until the end of the study, participants will collect all urine in a jug. On the&#xD;
      morning of Day 3, participants will complete urine collection and a blood sample will be&#xD;
      taken. Participants will then receive intravenously a medicine called cosyntropin, a&#xD;
      synthetic form of a hormone that the body makes. About 1 hour after this, participants will&#xD;
      provide a final blood sample. Participants will receive one last pill of hydrocortisone prior&#xD;
      to the end of the study.&#xD;

    <description>This is considered a non-standard treatment. On Day 1, participants will receive one 10-mg pill of hydrocortisone. On Day 3, participants will receive intravenously a medicine called cosyntropin, a synthetic form of a hormone that the body makes.
