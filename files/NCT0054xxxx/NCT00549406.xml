  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The ability to maintain balance and avoid falling is highly dependent on the ability to&#xD;
      locate objects and architectural features in the environment. This need to continually&#xD;
      monitor the environment as one moves about in daily life suggests a critical role for visual&#xD;
      attention, gaze control, and spatial memory, all of which are known to decline with aging. In&#xD;
      this study, the investigators will test the efficacy of a computer-based visual-training&#xD;
      program designed to improve the ability to rapidly extract information from the peripheral&#xD;
      visual field. It is expected that older adults involved in the visual training intervention&#xD;
      will improve the speed, accuracy, and effectiveness of reach-to-grasp balance-recovery&#xD;
      reactions evoked by sudden unpredictable balance perturbation.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Balance reactions that involve rapidly stepping or reaching to grasp a handrail or other&#xD;
      objects for support play a crucial role in preventing us from falling when we lose our&#xD;
      balance. However, to recover balance successfully, the central nervous system has to be able&#xD;
      to control the stepping or grasping movement to deal with &quot;environmental constraints&quot; (i.e.&#xD;
      objects and architectural features that can obstruct stepping or serve as handholds to&#xD;
      grasp), and hence must somehow monitor the location of potential constraints as we move about&#xD;
      in our daily lives. The need to monitor these environmental features suggests a critical role&#xD;
      for visual attention, gaze control, and spatial memory, all of which are known to decline&#xD;
      with aging. Although no studies have examined the effects on balance control, it is known&#xD;
      that such deficits can impair other motor behaviors such as driving and can be successfully&#xD;
      countered using a computer-based &quot;visual training&quot; intervention designed to improve the&#xD;
      ability to rapidly extract information from the peripheral visual field (the so-called&#xD;
      &quot;Useful Field of View&quot;, or UFOV).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed research will use an analogous approach to improve balance control.&#xD;
      Specifically, we will test whether: 1) the UFOV® computer-based visual-training program or a&#xD;
      commercially available video game leads to improved ability to use peripheral vision to&#xD;
      monitor changes in the spatial features of the surrounding environment, and 2) whether such&#xD;
      changes in visual processing are associated with improved ability to rapidly reach and grasp&#xD;
      a handrail for support, in response to a sudden unpredictable balance perturbation. Older&#xD;
      adults with documented deficits in UFOV scores will be randomly assigned to either the visual&#xD;
      training (UFOV or video game) or a control group. Each training group will undergo two&#xD;
      one-hour sessions per week, for five consecutive weeks. Neither group will be given any&#xD;
      information as to which training method is expected to be more beneficial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants in the experimental group will complete either the computerized UFOV®&#xD;
      speed-of-processing intervention or the video game training intervention. This UFOV&#xD;
      intervention focuses on the ability to quickly identify and locate visual targets presented&#xD;
      (for brief time intervals) in the central and peripheral visual fields. The training&#xD;
      challenges the participant to identify the target(s) in the briefest display duration&#xD;
      possible, within increasingly difficult task conditions. Difficulty of the training task is&#xD;
      increased by making it more difficult to identify the central target, decreasing the duration&#xD;
      of target presentation time, increasing the number of tasks to complete simultaneously,&#xD;
      adding distracters, and increasing the eccentricity (visual angle) of the peripheral targets.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants in the video game training group will participate in game play sessions using a&#xD;
      cartoon-based action video game with increasing levels of challenge and difficulty.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants in the control group will complete timed computerized word puzzles during the&#xD;
      training sessions. This cognitive task involves levels of social interaction and computer use&#xD;
      similar to the experimental group, but is not expected to yield improvements in ability to&#xD;
      rapidly process peripheral visuospatial information.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Balance assessments will be performed immediately before and after completion of the&#xD;
      intervention programs. Balance perturbations will be delivered using a large (2x2m)&#xD;
      computer-controlled motion platform. Subjects will stand at the center of the platform and a&#xD;
      motor-driven moveable handhold system will be mounted to the front wall of the platform. In&#xD;
      each trial, the handhold (a 10cm rod) will be controlled to move, intermittently and&#xD;
      unpredictably, back and forth along a horizontal axis in the frontal plane, before coming to&#xD;
      rest at one of four final locations (corresponding to visual angles of 5, 10, 15, and 20&#xD;
      degrees). The moving platform will deliver a small perturbation a few seconds after the final&#xD;
      handhold location is reached. Subjects will be told to grasp the handhold as quickly as&#xD;
      possible in response to the platform motion. During each trial, subjects will perform a&#xD;
      concurrent visual vigilance task, which requires them to continuously look straight ahead at&#xD;
      the center of a computer screen. This task is designed to ensure the subjects rely on&#xD;
      peripheral vision to acquire the spatial information needed to direct the hand toward the&#xD;
      handhold following the onset of the platform perturbation. The absence of any eye movements&#xD;
      toward the grasp location will be confirmed via recordings from a head-mounted eye tracker. A&#xD;
      motion-analysis system will be used to determine the speed and accuracy of the grasping&#xD;
      reactions.&#xD;
