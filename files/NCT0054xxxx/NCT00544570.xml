      RATIONALE: Giving high-dose chemotherapy before a peripheral blood stem cell transplant stops&#xD;
      the growth of cancer cells by stopping them from dividing or by killing them. Giving&#xD;
      colony-stimulating factors, such as G-CSF, helps stem cells move from the bone marrow to the&#xD;
      blood so they can be collected and stored. The stem cells are then returned to the patient to&#xD;
      replace the blood-forming cells that were destroyed by high-dose chemotherapy and radiation&#xD;
      therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE: This clinical trial is studying the side effects and how well high-dose chemotherapy&#xD;
      works in treating patients undergoing stem cell transplant for recurrent or refractory&#xD;
      Hodgkin's lymphoma.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the feasibility and toxicity of high-dose sequential therapy comprising&#xD;
           high-dose etoposide and cyclophosphamide with filgrastim (G-CSF) support followed by 2&#xD;
           courses of high-dose therapy and autologous stem cell transplantation in patients with&#xD;
           poor-risk recurrent or refractory Hodgkin lymphoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To analyze the response rate, progression-free survival, and overall survival of&#xD;
           patients treated with this regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the percentage of patients who can achieve a minimal disease status after&#xD;
           two courses of Hodgkin lymphoma chemotherapy and before &quot;classical autologous stem cell&#xD;
           transplantation.&quot;&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  First high-dose chemotherapy*: Patients receive high-dose cyclophosphamide IV over 2&#xD;
           hours followed by etoposide IV over 4 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      NOTE: *Patients with minimal disease (i.e., a single lymph node ≤ 2 cm in maximal horizontal&#xD;
      diameter or a &gt; 75% reduction in a bulky (≥ 10 cm) tumor mass AND no morphological evidence&#xD;
      of active bone marrow disease) at initial evaluation do not receive the first high-dose&#xD;
      chemotherapy but proceed directly to peripheral blood stem cell (PBSC) mobilization with&#xD;
      filgrastim (G-CSF) for 3 days and PBSC collection beginning on day 4.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Peripheral stem cell mobilization and collection: Patients receive G-CSF subcutaneously&#xD;
           beginning 96 hours after completion of etoposide and continuing through completion of&#xD;
           PBSC collection. Patients undergo leukapheresis to collect PBSC for reinfusion after&#xD;
           additional high-dose therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Second high-dose chemotherapy: Patients receive high-dose melphalan IV over 30 minutes&#xD;
           on day -1.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  First PBSC infusion: At least 24 hours after completion of melphalan, patients undergo&#xD;
           reinfusion of PBSC on day 0.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Local radiotherapy: Patients with a localized tumor mass &gt; 5 cm after the second course&#xD;
           of chemotherapy or a previous history of bulky disease (&gt; 10 cm or mediastinal mass &gt;&#xD;
           1/3 of transverse thoracic diameter) that has not been irradiated may receive local&#xD;
           radiotherapy for 2 weeks, at the discretion of the principal investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  High-dose therapy: Eight to 12 weeks after completion of the second course of&#xD;
           chemotherapy, patients receive 1 of 2 regimens.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Regimen A: Patients undergo fractionated total body irradiation 3 times daily on&#xD;
                days -8 to -5 (10 fractions) and receive high-dose etoposide IV over 4 hours on day&#xD;
                -4 and cyclophosphamide IV on day -2.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Regimen B: Patients receive high-dose carmustine IV over 4 hours on days -7 to -5&#xD;
                and etoposide and cyclophosphamide as in regimen A.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Second PBSC infusion: At least 48 hours after completion of cyclophosphamide, patients&#xD;
           undergo reinfusion of PBSC on day 0.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed at day 60 and then every 3 months&#xD;
      for up to 1 year.&#xD;
