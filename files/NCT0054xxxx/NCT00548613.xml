  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to determine if the transplant of a combination of stem&#xD;
      cells, obtained from the bone marrow of the same patient, is effective for utilization and&#xD;
      rescue of infarcted myocardium. End points will be the assessment of development of mature&#xD;
      and stable new blood vessels as well as improvement in cardiac function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This, Phase I, single center, prospective, non-randomized, open-label study will evaluate the&#xD;
      safety and feasibility of use of the proposed combination of autologous stem cells. Potential&#xD;
      subjects who fulfill clinical and laboratory entry criteria at screening will undergo a&#xD;
      process of bone marrow aspiration for preparation of the two types of bone marrow-derived&#xD;
      stem /progenitor cells to use. The two bone marrow-derived cell types will be mixed and&#xD;
      implanted to patients approximately 2 weeks after bone marrow aspiration. After transplant,&#xD;
      patients will be have a 3 month follow-up to evaluate safety as well as functional heart&#xD;
      improvement by analysis of symptoms, myocardial perfusion SPECT, and echocardiography.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population will include adult male and female subjects, ages 18-70, presenting with&#xD;
      acute myocardial infarction and subjects who have had a recent (within 12 months) myocardial&#xD;
      infarction and will undergo coronary artery bypass grafting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be divided in two groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  the first group will enroll patients with acute myocardial infarction whom percutaneous&#xD;
           coronary intervention restored myocardial flow after 4 hours or greater of the&#xD;
           initiation of symptoms,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  the second group will enroll patients who are candidates for coronary artery bypass&#xD;
           surgery and had a myocardial infarction in the past 12 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will receive the cell mixture by intracoronary or intramyocardial infusion,&#xD;
      respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The rationale of this clinical study is based on the observation that most attempts using&#xD;
      adult stem cells for myocardial regeneration have utilized a source of bone marrow derived&#xD;
      progenitor cells with the potential to generate new blood vessel and thus contribute to the&#xD;
      revascularization of the ischemic tissue. This therapy seems to be adequate but not&#xD;
      sufficient, since it lacks a source of stem cells capable of differentiating and maturing&#xD;
      into cardiac muscle cells, thus contributing to the recovery of local contractility. The&#xD;
      proposed combination stem/progenitor cell therapy to be used in this protocol is aimed at&#xD;
      contributing cell types capable of regenerating both blood vessels and muscle tissues damaged&#xD;
      after MI.&#xD;
