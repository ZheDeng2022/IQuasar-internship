      The goal of this clinical research study is to find the highest tolerable dose of Avastin™&#xD;
      that can be given in combination with 4 other study drug/drug combinations. It will be given&#xD;
      with sunitinib, with sorafenib, with a combination of erlotinib and cetuximab, and with a&#xD;
      combination of trastuzumab and lapatinib. The safety and effectiveness of these drug&#xD;
      combinations will also be studied.&#xD;

      The Study Drugs:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bevacizumab (Avastin™) is designed to prevent or slow down the growth of cancer cells by&#xD;
      blocking the growth of blood vessels&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sunitinib malate (SutentTM) is designed to block pathways that control important events such&#xD;
      as the growth of blood vessels that are vital for the growth of cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sorafenib (NexavarTM) is designed to block the function of important proteins in cancer&#xD;
      cells. These proteins, when active, are in part responsible for the abnormal growth and&#xD;
      behavior of cancer cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Erlotinib hydrochloride (TarcevaTM) is designed to block the activity of a protein found on&#xD;
      the surface of many tumor cells that may control tumor growth and survival. This may stop&#xD;
      tumors from growing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cetuximab (ErbituxTM) is designed to prevent or slow down the growth of cancer cells by&#xD;
      blocking proteins inside the cancer cell, called the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Trastuzumab (HerceptinTM) is designed to prevent or slow down the growth of cancer cells by&#xD;
      blocking proteins inside the cancer cell, called the Her2/neu receptor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lapatinib (TykerbTM) is designed to prevent or slow down the growth of cancer cells by&#xD;
      blocking proteins inside the cancer cell, called the Her2/neu receptor and EGFR.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Drug Dose Level:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, your doctor will decide which&#xD;
      study drugs you will receive based on the disease type and on the drugs you have taken in the&#xD;
      past.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once it is decided which drugs you will receive, you will be enrolled into a group of about&#xD;
      3-6 participants that are receiving the same drug combination. The first group of&#xD;
      participants will receive the lowest dose of the drug combination. The next group of&#xD;
      participants will receive the next highest dose of the drug combination. The third group will&#xD;
      receive an even higher dose than that. This process will continue until the study doctor&#xD;
      finds the highest safe dose of the drug combination. The dose that you receive will depend on&#xD;
      when you are enrolled in this study and the safety data that is available at that time. The&#xD;
      dose that you receive may be lowered if you do not tolerate the study drug combination well.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once the highest tolerated dose is found for each group, up to 10 more participants will be&#xD;
      added to each group at that dose level.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The dose levels testing the study drug combination of bevacizumab with either sunitinib or&#xD;
      sorafenib are now closed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Drug Administration:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Avastin™ is given through a needle in your vein. The first infusion is over 90 minutes. The&#xD;
      next infusion may be over 60 minutes if the first infusion was well tolerated. If you&#xD;
      tolerate the second infusion well, the third infusion may be over 30 minutes. If you take&#xD;
      trastuzumab and lapatinib with Avastin™, you will receive Avastin™ every 21 days. If you take&#xD;
      cetuximab and erlotinib with Avastin™, you will receive Avastin™ every 14 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are assigned to take cetuximab and erlotinib, cetuximab will be given by vein once&#xD;
      every week. The first time you receive cetuximab, it will be given over 2 hours. All other&#xD;
      infusions will be given over 60 minutes. Erlotinib is taken by mouth every day during the&#xD;
      28-day study cycle. You should take erlotinib on an empty stomach either 1 hour before eating&#xD;
      or 2 hours after eating.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are assigned to take trastuzumab and lapatinib, trastuzumab will be given by vein once&#xD;
      every 21-day study cycle. The first infusion will be over 90 minutes. If you handle the&#xD;
      infusion well, each additional infusion will be over 30 minutes Lapatinib will be taken by&#xD;
      mouth every day for 21 days. You should take lapatinib on an empty stomach either 1 hour&#xD;
      before eating or 2 hours after eating.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Visits:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Avastin, cetuximab, and erlotinib:&#xD;
&#xD;
      During Cycle 1, you will have a study visit during Weeks 1 and 2. During Cycles 2 and beyond,&#xD;
      you will have a study visit during Week 1. At these visits, you will have a physical exam,&#xD;
      and blood (about 1 tablespoon) will be drawn for routine tests. If the routine urine test&#xD;
      done at screening had abnormal results, urine may be collected for additional routine tests&#xD;
      during the study. After 2 cycles, you will have the physical exam every 1-2 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Every week, you will have blood drawn (about 2 teaspoons) for routine tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During Week 1 of all cycles, you will have urine collected for routine tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After every 2 cycles, you will have a CT or MRI scan to check the status of the disease.&#xD;
      After 6 months (6 cycles) of study drug treatment, you will have the CT or MRI scan every 2-4&#xD;
      cycles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Avastin, trastuzumab, and lapatinib:&#xD;
&#xD;
      During Cycle 1, you will have a study visit during Weeks 1 and 2. During Cycles 2 and beyond,&#xD;
      you will have a study visit during Week 1. At these visits, you will have a physical exam,&#xD;
      and blood (about 1 tablespoon) will be drawn for routine tests. If the routine urine test&#xD;
      done at screening had abnormal results, urine may be collected for additional routine tests&#xD;
      during the study. After 2 cycles, you will have the physical exam every 1-2 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During Week 1 of all cycles, you will have urine collected for routine tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After every 2 cycles, you will have a CT or MRI scan to check the status of the disease.&#xD;
      After 6 months (8 cycles) of study drug treatment, you will have the CT or MRI scan every 2-4&#xD;
      cycles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Length of Study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      You may remain on study for as long as you are benefitting. You will be taken off study if&#xD;
      the disease gets worse or intolerable side effects occur.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an investigational study. Avastin™, erlotinib, cetuximab, trastuzumab, and lapatinib&#xD;
      are all FDA approved and commercially available. Avastin™ is FDA approved for the treatment&#xD;
      of colorectal cancer and lung cancer. Erlotinib is FDA approved for the treatment of lung&#xD;
      cancer and pancreatic cancer. Cetuximab is FDA approved for the treatment of colorectal&#xD;
      cancer and cancer of the head and neck. Trastuzumab is FDA approved for the treatment of&#xD;
      breast cancer. Lapatinib is FDA approved for the treatment of breast cancer. The use of these&#xD;
      drugs together is investigational and authorized for use in research only.&#xD;

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Patients with advanced or metastatic cancer that is refractory to standard therapy,&#xD;
             relapsed after standard therapy, or have no standard therapy that induces a CR rate of&#xD;
             at least 10% or improves survival by at least three months.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Patients must be three weeks from prior cytotoxic therapy; if they have recovered&#xD;
             their blood counts to eligibility levels sooner and have no mucositis or other acute&#xD;
             toxicities, they may be treated earlier but no sooner than two weeks after their last&#xD;
             chemotherapy. Patients must be two weeks or five half lives from biologic therapy,&#xD;
             whichever is shorter.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. ECOG performance status &lt;/= 2 (Karnofsky &gt;/= 60%).&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Patients must have normal organ and marrow function defined as: absolute neutrophil&#xD;
             count &gt;/= 1,000/mL; platelets &gt;/=75,000/mL; creatinine &lt;/= 3 X ULN; total bilirubin&#xD;
             &lt;/= 2.0; ALT(SGPT) &lt;/= 3 X ULN; Exception for patients with liver metastasis: total&#xD;
             bilirubin &lt;/= 3 x ULN; ALT(SGPT) &lt;/= 5 X ULN. Exception for the bevacizumab +&#xD;
             erlotinib + cetuximab arm and the bevacizumab + trastuzumab + lapatinib arm: no&#xD;
             minimum absolute neutrophil count or platelet count.&#xD;
