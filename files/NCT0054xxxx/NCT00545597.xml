      Study of the use of Lorenzo's oil in adults with adrenomyeloneuropathy, the adult form of&#xD;
      Lorenzo's oil.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a double-masked placebo controlled study of glyceryl trioleate-glyceryl trierucate&#xD;
      (Lorenzo's Oil (LO)) therapy in adrenomyeloneuropathy (AMN), the adult form of X-linked&#xD;
      adrenoleukodystrophy (X-ALD). AMN is a slowly progressive distal axonopathy that involves the&#xD;
      long tracts of the spinal cord and differs from the rapidly progressive inflammatory cerebral&#xD;
      forms that most commonly affect boys and adolescents. All forms of X-ALD are associated with&#xD;
      the abnormal accumulation of very long chain fatty acids (VLCFA) in plasma and tissues. The&#xD;
      oral administration of LO normalizes plasma VLCFA levels within 4 weeks. While previous&#xD;
      therapeutic trials of LO therapy in patients with the cerebral forms of X-ALD have been&#xD;
      disappointing, recent studies suggest that it is beneficial in two types of X-ALD: 1) as a&#xD;
      preventive of neurological involvement in asymptomatic boys; and 2) in AMN, where it appears&#xD;
      to slow the rate of progression. None of the previous studies have been controlled, and we&#xD;
      are now conducting the first placebo-controlled trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The 4-year study will include 120 men with AMN who do not have evidence of cerebral&#xD;
      involvement, and 120 women who are heterozygous for X-ALD and have an AMN-like syndrome. The&#xD;
      rate of progression will be compared in the LO and placebo groups using the Kurtzke EDSS&#xD;
      score as the primary outcome and a variety of secondary outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adrenomyeloneuropathy affects about 1 in 40,000 men and 1 in 30,000 women. It is a&#xD;
      progressive disorder that leads to inability to walk and other severe deficits. This study&#xD;
      will provide definitive information whether Lorenzo's Oil therapy can slow progression.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Males or females age 18 years or older in whom the diagnosis of X-ALD has been&#xD;
             confirmed by VLCFA assay and/or mutation analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Clinical evidence of spinal cord involvement with EDSS score between 1 and 6.5.&#xD;
             Patients with an EDSS score of 6.5 are severely affected but have retained the&#xD;
             capacity to walk 20 meters with the aid of a walker, crutch, or two canes.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Either a normal brain MRI, or a type 3 pattern of MRI abnormality in which the&#xD;
             abnormality is considered to represent the centripetal extension of the distal&#xD;
             axonopathy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Adrenal function assessed by measurement of plasma ACTH and appropriate steroid&#xD;
             replacement if adrenal insufficiency is present.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Kurtzke EDSS score of &gt;6.5.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Cognitive or behavioral abnormalities that impair capacity to give informed consent or&#xD;
             carry out procedures that form part of the protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Current use, or use within 3 months, of Lorenzo's oil or other therapies that may&#xD;
             alter the course of X-ALD. Bone marrow transplant will be a permanent exclusion&#xD;
             criterion.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Contraindications for MRI procedure such as subjects with paramagnetic materials in&#xD;
             the body, such as aneurysm clips, pacemakers, intraocular metal or cochlear implants.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects who are pregnant.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Allergies to peppermint&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Presence of non-specific conditions that may interfere with clinical assessment or&#xD;
             participation in the protocol.&#xD;
