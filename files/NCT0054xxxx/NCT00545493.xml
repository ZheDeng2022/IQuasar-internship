  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Rasmussen encephalitis (RE) is a rare but severe chronic inflammatory brain disease of&#xD;
      unknown origin affecting one brain hemisphere. It is usually accompanied by intractable&#xD;
      epilepsy. In addition, it often leads to severe disability due to functional deficits caused&#xD;
      by atrophy of one brain hemisphere. Hemispherectomy is an effective means of surgical&#xD;
      treatment of the epilepsy. It renders the patient, however, hemiplegic, hemianopic and (if&#xD;
      the language dominant hemisphere is affected) aphasic. To slow down or even stop the&#xD;
      progressive inflammatory damage to the affected brain hemisphere, immunotherapies may be&#xD;
      beneficial. According to a literature survey, tacrolimus (twice daily intake of capsules) and&#xD;
      intravenous immunoglobulins (monthly infusions) are the most promising compounds for this. In&#xD;
      the investigators' study, these two types of treatment are randomly assigned to patients with&#xD;
      disease onset within the last year and not too far advanced disability or hemispheric brain&#xD;
      injury. The patients are followed to assess prospectively the functional and brain MRI course&#xD;
      of the disease.&#xD;

      1. Trial design/2. Trial interventions Patients are screened in epileptological,&#xD;
      neuropediatric, and neurological centers all over Germany. The study design was approved on a&#xD;
      meeting in Bonn on April 20, 2002 by several external participants and by the ethical&#xD;
      committee of the University of Bonn. Patients with the suspected diagnosis of RE are&#xD;
      transferred to the Department of Epileptology of the University of Bonn. If the diagnosis &quot;RE&#xD;
      in the acute stage&quot; is confirmed and the patient or (in children) the parents give informed&#xD;
      consent, the patients are randomized to one of the two active treatment arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study was started on 1.10.2002. The first patient was included on 20.11.2002.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3. Inclusion/exclusion criteria See appropriate section&#xD;
&#xD;
      4. Duration Recruitment started on 1.10.2002 and will go on until the proposed number of&#xD;
      study participants has been included. A patient remains in the study until he or she reaches&#xD;
      one of the predefined exit parameters (see below, #4.5). Every patient will be followed under&#xD;
      study conditions for at least 12 months (to obtain true long term results).&#xD;
&#xD;
      5. Outcome measures See appropriate section.&#xD;
&#xD;
      6. Methods against bias The patients will be randomized to one of the treatment arms. To&#xD;
      avoid unbalanced group sizes and unequal numbers of adolescents and adults, there are two&#xD;
      randomization lists, one for patients &lt; 11 years, one for older patients (stratification).&#xD;
      Blinding is not possible because the administration of the two drugs is different and would&#xD;
      have necessitated the additional use of placebo capsules in the IVIG group and placebo&#xD;
      infusions in the tacrolimus group. Because the production and administration of an adequate&#xD;
      &quot;IVIG-placebo&quot; is highly impracticable, no blinded treatment application was planned. The&#xD;
      physicians assessing the &quot;Motricity Index&quot; and the &quot;Hemispheric ratio&quot; are unaware of the&#xD;
      kind of treatment used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      7. Power calculations It is assumed that 1-2 RE patients are diagnosed at a large epilepsy&#xD;
      center per year. The cooperation of the study center with the other specialized centers in&#xD;
      Germany is good. Therefore, it is expected that the majority of RE cases are transferred to&#xD;
      or department. We estimated that 16 suitable patients can be included within the proposed&#xD;
      inclusion period. The disease is too rare to perform power calculations (which are mainly&#xD;
      used to limit recruitment figures). RE is an orphan disease, so even if the number of&#xD;
      participants will not suffice to detect small to moderated differences between the two&#xD;
      treatments, the results will provide invaluable information on the conservative treatment of&#xD;
      the condition, e.g. in comparison to historical untreated controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      8. Number of participants It is intended to include at least 16 patients during the above&#xD;
      named period (otherwise, the recruitment period will be prolonged). We will perform an&#xD;
      intention to treat analysis and an analysis of the patients treated per protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      9. Trial sites Potential study participants are referred to our department (Dept. of&#xD;
      Epileptology, University of Bonn) from all over Germany. The study procedures, especially the&#xD;
      clinical and neuroradiological follow-up studies including assessment of safety parameters&#xD;
      are performed in Bonn (visits every two months within the first year, in the second year&#xD;
      every four months, thereafter every six months). In the intervals between the visits in Bonn,&#xD;
      the referring centers participate in monitoring of the patients and administration of IVIG.&#xD;
      There is continuous contact between the study center Bonn and the external study co-workers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      10. Analyses Primary outcome parameter (time to exit): The two groups will be compared by the&#xD;
      log rank test (Kaplan-Meyer-survival curves). Non-parametric tests will be applied for the&#xD;
      secondary outcome parameters.&#xD;
&#xD;
      11. Ethical considerations Tacrolimus and IVIG can have side effects. The known tacrolimus&#xD;
      side effects are more severe and more frequent than those of IVIG. It must be noted, however,&#xD;
      that the known tacrolimus side effects were assessed in organ transplant patients who had&#xD;
      severe medical diseases and were usually treated with more than one immunosuppressant. In&#xD;
      patients with autoimmune disorders treated with tacrolimus-monotherapy, the side effects were&#xD;
      considerably lower. RE itself is a disease with a deleterious natural course so that the&#xD;
      possible risks of an immunotherapy are clearly outweighed. It must be assumed that most RE&#xD;
      patients worldwide are treated with any kind of immunotherapy in the early disease stage due&#xD;
      to the favorable case reports in the literature. Therefore, a placebo control group appears&#xD;
      ethically unacceptable. This is why we chose to compare the two most promising substances.&#xD;
      The ethics committee of the University of Bonn has approved the study design.&#xD;
