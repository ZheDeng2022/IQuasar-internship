  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pregnancy is a critical time to address preventable behavioral risks that pose serious&#xD;
      threats to the health of both the mother and the developing fetus. We propose to conduct a&#xD;
      randomized, controlled trial to determine the extent to which the Health in Pregnancy (HIP)&#xD;
      program, a brief motivational intervention featuring a &quot;Video Doctor,&quot; provider cueing&#xD;
      sheets, and patient educational worksheets, can reduce pregnant women's cigarette smoking,&#xD;
      alcohol drinking, illicit drug use, and domestic violence risks compared with usual care.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Regular prenatal visits offer opportunities to deliver and reinforce risk reduction messages&#xD;
      regarding tobacco, alcohol, or illicit drug use and domestic violence. Because health care&#xD;
      providers may lack the time, comfort, or skills to screen or counsel their patients about&#xD;
      these risks, innovative approaches are needed. Computer programs are increasingly used to&#xD;
      assess risky behaviors and deliver individualized preventive interventions. We have designed&#xD;
      a randomized, controlled trial to determine if a brief, interactive, multimedia intervention&#xD;
      delivered on a laptop computer and integrated into routine prenatal care can reduce pregnant&#xD;
      women's smoking, drinking, drug use, and experiences of domestic violence compared to usual&#xD;
      care. To capitalize on health care providers' credibility, the multimedia intervention is&#xD;
      delivered by an actor-portrayed &quot;Video Doctor&quot; programmed to respond to participant input,&#xD;
      simulating a live interview. Pregnant women who receive prenatal care at one of the study&#xD;
      sites and who consent to participate will be screened for substance use and domestic violence&#xD;
      prior to a regularly scheduled medical appointment. Women who report one or more of these&#xD;
      risks will be randomly assigned to the Intervention or Control group according to a blocked,&#xD;
      stratified randomization plan. Participants in the Intervention group will receive the Health&#xD;
      in Pregnancy (HIP) intervention, consisting of brief, multimedia counseling presented by a&#xD;
      &quot;Video Doctor&quot; and an educational worksheet. Their provider will receive a &quot;Cueing Sheet,&quot;&#xD;
      which offers a brief summary of the patient's risk profile and suggests counseling&#xD;
      statements. Components of the multimedia program will be tailored to each participant's risk&#xD;
      profile and readiness to change. Women assigned to the Control group will complete a risk&#xD;
      assessment than receive the usual care offered by the health care settings. Both Intervention&#xD;
      and Control participants will complete two follow-up risk assessments at consecutive medical&#xD;
      visits approximately four weeks apart. At the first follow-up session, Intervention&#xD;
      participants will also receive &quot;booster&quot; risk reduction messages from teh video doctor. To&#xD;
      determine the effect of the HIP program on patient-provider discussions, both Intervention&#xD;
      and Control participants will complete a post-interview after their medical appointment. The&#xD;
      post-interview will also assess the acceptability of the HIP program by participants. To&#xD;
      determine the effect of teh program on participants' risky behaviors we will compare&#xD;
      self-reported discussions, behavior change, and readiness to change at baseline and at a&#xD;
      third session with the computer program. We expect that participants in the Intervention&#xD;
      group will show significant reductions in risky behaviors compared to the Control group.&#xD;
