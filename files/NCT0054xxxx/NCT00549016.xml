      The ultimate purpose is to explore the potential techniques to exclude aneurysms and provide&#xD;
      an alternative conduit for arterial flow. The single center sponsorship is intended to&#xD;
      provide the investigators the potential to incorporate improvements in existing technology&#xD;
      during the course of the study thereby ultimately enhancing the potential for superior&#xD;
      medical care of patients suffering from these disease states. The sponsor/investigator&#xD;
      recognizes and accepts responsibility to notify and receive approval from the agency when&#xD;
      device modifications are made that may affect patient safety.&#xD;

      The Arizona Heart Institute is respectfully submitting this protocol for a feasibility study&#xD;
      utilizing the endoluminal grafts constructed of PTFE encapsulated nitinol stents. The study&#xD;
      is intended to evaluate the use of this unique device in the treatment of aortic aneurysmal&#xD;
      disease. The stent graft is made by laminating a PTFE &quot;jacket&quot; around nitinol stents which&#xD;
      act as structural and fixation supports. Both materials have an extensive history of use in&#xD;
      various types of implanted devices. CT scans and angiography or 3D computer imaging, and&#xD;
      possibly IVUS imaging will be used to choose the sites for placement of the devices and to&#xD;
      assure precise deployment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In comparison to the conventional surgical approach, endoluminal stent-graft techniques for&#xD;
      repair of abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs) offer the advantages of a minimally invasive&#xD;
      procedure with lower morbidity and perhaps cost reduction. The Arizona Heart Institute has a&#xD;
      long history in the area of endoluminal grafting for treatment of aneurysms and occlusive&#xD;
      disease. Endoluminal sleeves principally using ePTFE and both stainless steel and nitinol&#xD;
      stent structures have been studied using commercially available materials customized for&#xD;
      particular pathologic situations. As the technology advances however, sophisticated&#xD;
      engineering beyond the capabilities of our institution was required.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed project originates because of the potential to escalate the combination of ePTFE&#xD;
      and stents to a higher level of performance in aneurysm exclusion procedures. Current data&#xD;
      reflect several deficiencies in approved exclusion devices. Migration, types I, II and III&#xD;
      endoleaks and continual aneurysm expansion are clear predictors for potential ruptures.&#xD;
      Increased complications associated with the initial peri-procedural deployment as devices are&#xD;
      released on a broader scale have been observed. In order to address these problems, the&#xD;
      Arizona Heart Institute has engaged EndoMed engineering to design the endoluminal graft to&#xD;
      repair abdominal aortic aneurysms. We believe this will result in a positive step forward in&#xD;
      the technology to exclude aneurysmal disease less invasively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The endoluminal stent-graft is composed of multiple nitinol stents which are encapsulated in&#xD;
      expanded Polytetrafluoroethylene (ePTFE). The stents are composed of a Z-shaped, performed&#xD;
      nitinol wire, which is crimped together with a stainless steel sleeve to form the circular&#xD;
      frame of the graft. This frame is then encapsulated between two thin sheets of laminated&#xD;
      PTFE. The proximal end of the endoluminal stent-graft is made in two configurations. One is a&#xD;
      completely encapsulated graft where the PTFE covers the entire device. The other has an open&#xD;
      stent segment (bare wire configuration) that allows the open stent region of the graft to be&#xD;
      placed across the orifice of the renal, mesenteric, or internal iliac arteries without&#xD;
      obstructing antegrade blood flow. The device will be available in a straight tube,&#xD;
      aortomonoiliac or bifurcated design.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once the endoluminal stent graft is built, a 4 French guidewire dilator is placed through the&#xD;
      center of the graft and the assembly is compressed into a high density polyethylene (HDPE)&#xD;
      cartridge for ease of intraluminal delivery. The endoluminal stent-graft is then placed in&#xD;
      two Tyvek pouches and sterilized using Hydrogen Peroxide.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will undergo an evaluation of the PTFE encapsulation of Nitinol stents to provide&#xD;
      data on the device's feasibility for therapeutic clinical use. Follow-up will be completed at&#xD;
      1, 6, 12, 24, 36, 48, and 60 months. Subject evaluation at 1 month will include a Complete&#xD;
      History and Physical, Bilateral ABIs, Abdominal Duplex Ultrasound, and a KUB X-ray (4 views).&#xD;
      Subject evaluation at 6 months will also include a Complete History and Physical, Bilateral&#xD;
      ABIs, Abdominal Duplex Ultrasound, KUB X-ray (4 views), and based on the duplex ultrasound an&#xD;
      Abdominal CT scan with and without IV contrast 2.5 mm and Labs (BUN/Creatinine). Subject&#xD;
      evaluation at 12, 24, 36, 48, and 60 months will include a Complete History and Physical,&#xD;
      Bilateral ABIs, Abdominal CT scan with and without IV contrast 2.5 mm, Abdominal Duplex&#xD;
      Ultrasound, KUB X-ray (4 views), and Labs (BUN/Creatinine).&#xD;
