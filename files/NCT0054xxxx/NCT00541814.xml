  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this trial is to ascertain whether the withdrawal of calcineurin inhibitors&#xD;
      (CNI) will lead to less kidney transplant damage when compared with minimisation. The&#xD;
      investigators will assess this by comparing the degree of damage on kidney biopsies taken&#xD;
      before and after minimisation/withdrawal of CNI.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Renal transplantation is the most effective form of treatment for end-stage renal failure. It&#xD;
      doubles long-term survival and has major socioeconomic and health benefits compared to&#xD;
      patients who remain on dialysis. Graft survival in the UK is 90% at one year and greater than&#xD;
      75% at 5 years [UKTransplant, 2004], with better survival of grafts from living donors&#xD;
      compared with deceased. However, by 15 years post-transplantation, over 50% of recipients who&#xD;
      are still alive have returned to dialysis. Indeed, premature allograft failure is now one of&#xD;
      the leading causes of end stage renal disease. As short-term outcomes of renal&#xD;
      transplantation continue to improve, increasing attention is being paid to this late&#xD;
      attrition of renal allografts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is recognised that calcineurin inhibitor (CNI) nephrotoxicity is a major factor in late&#xD;
      renal allograft failure and dysfunction. In fact, withdrawal of CNI from patients with&#xD;
      deteriorating graft function may improve graft function. However, there is abundant evidence&#xD;
      that histological renal allograft damage may progress even in the absence of changes in renal&#xD;
      function - i.e. declining renal function is a late marker of renal damage, and therefore&#xD;
      institution of therapies (including CNI minimisation) to slow this process may be &quot;too&#xD;
      little, too late&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CNI minimisation may be optimised by three major routes. Firstly, by minimising the CNI&#xD;
      beyond 12 months post transplantation when the risk of acute rejection is at its greatest.&#xD;
      Secondly, by performing a renal biopsy in patients prior to CNI minimisation and avoiding CNI&#xD;
      minimisation in patients with inflammation on the biopsy. Finally, converting azathioprine to&#xD;
      mycophenolate prior to CNI minimisation should have a renoprotective effect.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The type of CNI we will investigate is cyclosporine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who fulfill the study entry criteria will require a renal allograft biopsy prior to&#xD;
      randomisation to exclude acute rejection, recurrent disease or de novo glomerulonephritis.&#xD;
      Those patients with an acceptable biopsy will proceed to randomisation on a 1:1 basis into 2&#xD;
      groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 1: CNI [Cyclosporine] minimisation; Group 2: CNI [Cyclosporine] withdrawal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At this point participants will undergo assessment of the primary and secondary outcome&#xD;
      measures. The treatment period comprises three stages:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Firstly, a 2 week period during which the patient will be stabilised on mycophenolate sodium&#xD;
      720mg twice daily (in place of azathioprine);&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondly, a 3 month period during which the CNI [Cyclosporine} will be either targeted to a&#xD;
      specified low blood level of 50-100ng/ml, or withdrawn completely (depending on&#xD;
      randomisation);&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thirdly, a 12 month maintenance period on the new immunosuppression regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the first two stages, patients will be reviewed every 2 weeks. This 2-weekly follow-up&#xD;
      will continue for the first two months of the third stage of the study, and then visits will&#xD;
      be reduced to monthly. At these visits routine blood and urine analysis will be performed as&#xD;
      per routine clinical practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of the third stage of the study (i.e. 16 months after randomisation) the&#xD;
      participants will undergo the second assessment of the primary and secondary outcome&#xD;
      measures. This will signify study end for the individual study participant.&#xD;
