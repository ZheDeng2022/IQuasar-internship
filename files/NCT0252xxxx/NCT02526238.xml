    <textblock>
      This is a double blinded, randomized control trial with a pretest-posttest control and&#xD;
      interventional group design. The assessor is blinded to all assessments and evaluations. All&#xD;
      patients with subacute stroke undergo in-patient or out-patient rehabilitation are screened&#xD;
      initially by a series of screening test. Suitable patients are assigned randomly to two&#xD;
      groups respectively. Group 1 is the experimental group for Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation&#xD;
      (TMS) and trunk rotation; Group 2 is the control group with only trunk rotation training and&#xD;
      placebo stimulation.&#xD;

      Methodology&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sampling:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Convenient sampling will be conducted to all in and out-patients with stroke referred&#xD;
      consecutively to occupational therapy department in Kowloon Hospital during the data&#xD;
      collection period. Patients who meet the following inclusion criteria are admitted for study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. First or second stroke (haemorrhagic or ischaemic) confirmed by computer axial&#xD;
           tomography scan or magnetic resonance imaging&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Neurological representation compatible with a unilateral right lesion involvement (i.e.&#xD;
           left hemiplegic), exhibited left visual field inattention or neglect by following either&#xD;
           one of below criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  obtaining a total score of star cancellation subtest in the conventional battery of&#xD;
                the Behavioral Inattention Test &lt;51 (out of 54)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  obtaining a total score of line bisection subtest in the conventional battery of&#xD;
                the Behavioral Inattention Test &lt;7 (out of 9)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Score of Catherine Bergego Scale â‰¥ 1&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Right handed&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Less than six months since onset of stroke at study entry&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Able to follow simple command&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Patients with severe dysphasia (either expressive or comprehensive) which restricts&#xD;
           communication;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. History of other neurological disease, psychiatric disorder, or alcoholism;&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. significant impairment in visual acuity caused by cataracts, diabetic retinopathy,&#xD;
           glaucoma or hemianopia&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Any additional medical or psychological condition that would affect their ability to&#xD;
           comply with the study protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Collection and Treatment Procedures Written consent is obtained from all subjects before&#xD;
      the randomization. All patients in both the experimental and placebo groups undergo the same&#xD;
      rehabilitation process. Subject's demographic data are collected; they include age, gender,&#xD;
      lesion site, educational level, time after onset of stroke, and global cognitive status as&#xD;
      defined by the Mini-mental State Examination - Chinese version (CMMSE). Repeated measurements&#xD;
      are done at day 0 (date for initial assessment), day 10 (end of treatment) and post 4 weeks.&#xD;
      Assessments including Behavioral Inattention Test (BIT) - Chinese version, Catherine Bergego&#xD;
      Scale, Functional Test for the hemiplegic upper extremity (FTHUE-HK), Upper-extremity portion&#xD;
      of the Fugl-Meyer Scale (UE-FM), Functional Independence Measure (FIM), Stroke Adapted 30&#xD;
      item version of the Sickness Impact Profile (SA-SIP 30) score will be done at these intervals&#xD;
      by a blind assessor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment sessions for the experimental groups and control groups are conducted by trained&#xD;
      investigator for transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and the case therapists. The&#xD;
      conventional treatment would consist of 45 minutes of voluntary trunk rotation exercise using&#xD;
      set-up equipment as well as 15 minutes of activities of daily living (ADL) training.&#xD;
