  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is an autosomal dominant disease characterized by&#xD;
      unexplained hypertrophy of the left ventricle, often with predominant involvement of the&#xD;
      interventricular septum, and characterized by myocyte disarray and fibrosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HCM is the most common familial heart disease with strong genetic heterogeneity, demonstrated&#xD;
      over the past 20 years. Mutations in 11 or more genes encoding proteins of the cardiac&#xD;
      sarcomere are responsible for (or associated with) HCM.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, 30-40% of sporadic and familial cases of HCM are still genetically unlabelled. In&#xD;
      addition, secondary HCM caused by Fabry's disease or amyloidosis, may mimic primary HCM and&#xD;
      may be under diagnosed. This may result in a delay in accurate diagnosis and instauration of&#xD;
      specific treatment, with possible clinical consequences for the patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For these reasons, we decided to apply a new diagnostic strategy for patients with newly&#xD;
      diagnosed HCM, including the whole exome sequencing (WES) technology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If correctly applied, this new technology has the potential to strongly reduce the diagnostic&#xD;
      wavering leading to earlier diagnosis and genetic counseling in sarcomeric HCM and rarer&#xD;
      forms of secondary HCM including Fabry's disease and amyloidosis, and also specific therapy&#xD;
      set-up in secondary forms of HCM. It should also allow identifying new genes responsible for&#xD;
      HCM.&#xD;

      Background : Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is an autosomal dominant disease characterized&#xD;
      by unexplained hypertrophy of the left ventricle, often with predominant involvement of the&#xD;
      interventricular septum, and characterized by myocyte disarray and fibrosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HCM is the most common familial heart disease with strong genetic heterogeneity, demonstrated&#xD;
      over the past 20 years. Mutations in 11 or more genes encoding proteins of the cardiac&#xD;
      sarcomere are responsible for (or associated with) HCM.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, 30-40% of sporadic and familial cases of HCM are still genetically unlabelled. In&#xD;
      addition, secondary HCM caused by Fabry's disease or amyloidosis, may mimic primary HCM and&#xD;
      may be under diagnosed. This may result in a delay in accurate diagnosis and instauration of&#xD;
      specific treatment, with possible clinical consequences for the patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives : For these reasons, we decided to apply a new diagnostic strategy for patients&#xD;
      with newly diagnosed HCM, including the whole exome sequencing (WES) technology.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Main objective: to evaluate the additional diagnostic value of the new proposed strategy&#xD;
           for the identification of a specific cause of HCM as compared with conventional&#xD;
           diagnostic strategy&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Secondary objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To evaluate the frequency of secondary HCM (Fabry's disease, amyloidosis, mitochondrial&#xD;
      cardiomyopathies, and others) observed by this systematic screening in a population of newly&#xD;
      diagnosed HCM&#xD;
&#xD;
      Perspectives: If correctly applied, this new technology has the potential to strongly reduce&#xD;
      the diagnostic wavering leading to earlier diagnosis and genetic counseling in sarcomeric HCM&#xD;
      and rarer forms of secondary HCM including Fabry's disease and amyloidosis, and also specific&#xD;
      therapy set-up in secondary forms of HCM. It should also allow identifying new genes&#xD;
      responsible for HCM.&#xD;
