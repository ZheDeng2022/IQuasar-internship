  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Intimate partner violence (IPV), also known as domestic abuse, is a leading cause of&#xD;
      non-fatal injury in women worldwide. 1 in 6 women attending surgical fracture clinics have a&#xD;
      history of IPV in the past year. Given the high prevalence and costs associated with IPV,&#xD;
      there is a need to identify health outcomes associated with IPV, the incidence of new and&#xD;
      worsening cases of IPV, and resource use among IPV victims. This prospective cohort study of&#xD;
      women with fractures and dislocations will assess differences in injury-related outcomes&#xD;
      (time to fracture healing, injury-related complications, and return to pre-injury function)&#xD;
      between abused and non-abused women. This study will also determine whether a musculoskeletal&#xD;
      injury can lead to new or worsening abuse by an intimate partner and how patterns of IPV&#xD;
      change over time following musculoskeletal injuries.Finally, the proposed study will also&#xD;
      inform the feasibility of a larger multinational cohort study.&#xD;

&#xD;
      250&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Research Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Feasibility&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Research Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objectives are to determine:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. How a history of IPV affects injury-related complications;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. How a history of IPV affects return to pre-injury function;&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Incident cases of IPV after a musculoskeletal injury, if the injury was not the result&#xD;
           of IPV;&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. How a history of IPV affects health care and support service use after a musculoskeletal&#xD;
           injury;&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. How a history of IPV affects health-related quality of life after a musculoskeletal&#xD;
           injury;&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. How patterns of IPV change over time after a musculoskeletal injury;&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. How abused women's stage of change changes over time after a musculoskeletal injury&#xD;
&#xD;

           musculoskeletal injury;&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. patients presenting with a fracture or dislocation which is being managed with either&#xD;
           surgical or non-surgical treatment.&#xD;

&#xD;
        1. unwilling to or unable to provide consent;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. unable to complete the study questionnaires in a private location, due to safety and&#xD;

        3. unwilling or unable to follow the study protocol or their attending surgeon has concerns&#xD;
           about their ability or willingness to follow study protocols;&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. does not speak and write in English or the dominant language of the local clinic&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Outcomes:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome is feasibility. Secondary outcomes are injury-related complications,&#xD;
      return to function, incidence of IPV, quality of life, abuse type and severity, and stage of&#xD;
      change.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Duration of Patient Follow-Up:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study participants will be followed for 12 months&#xD;
