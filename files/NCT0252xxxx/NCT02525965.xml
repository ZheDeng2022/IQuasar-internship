      Before the surgery, the investigators predict the risk of microvascular invasion (MVI)&#xD;
      presence for the early-stage hepatocellular carcinoma according to the nomogram the&#xD;
      investigators have created. Patients with a high risk of microvascular invasion were randomly&#xD;
      chose to give the treatment of a wide resection margin, which establish an individualized&#xD;
      anti-recurrence program based on the high-grade evidence-based medicine.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Although liver resection is still the first line of treatment for hepatocellular carcinoma&#xD;
      (HCC) presently, 5-year overall recurrence rates &gt; 70%, the same with early-stage&#xD;
      hepatocellular carcinoma, for some studies reported the rates &gt; 40%. Recurrence is also the&#xD;
      first cause of death in these patients, so recurrence is the most important factors affecting&#xD;
      surgical results of HCC. For the precaution of cancer recurrence, there are no proven&#xD;
      techniques for clinical reference at present.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For now, there has been many controversies on the impact about the width of liver resection&#xD;
      margin on curative effect. Poon has proven that there is no significant difference in&#xD;
      recurrence rate between resection margin &gt; 1cm and resection margin &lt; 1cm. However, Shi et al&#xD;
      published a randomized controlled trial: for patients with a solitary tumor, resection margin&#xD;
      &gt; 2cm can reduce the recurrence rate after hepatectomy. This is also the only randomized&#xD;
      clinical trial study which proves increaseing resection margin will benefit the clinical&#xD;
      results at present. A meta analysis consist of 18 studies proves that whether the resection&#xD;
      margin has a relationship with a benefit clinical result still needs a further verification.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the other hand, because microvascular invasion (MVI) is the direct evidence of the micro&#xD;
      metastasis in hepatocellular carcinoma, it will decrease recurrence rate for the patients&#xD;
      with a high MVI risk, if the investigators increase the resection margin width during the&#xD;
      surgery? Shanghai Eastern Hepatobiliary Surgery Hospital which the investigators affiliated&#xD;
      with had ever conducted a retrospective analysis on consecutive 3263 patients with HCC&#xD;
      hepatectomy, the results indicated that a wide resection margin（≥1cm）can benefit those&#xD;
      patients with microvascular invasion , nevertheless, the benefit will not present if patients&#xD;
      are without microvascular invasion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Further and better proofs still needs to approval this consequence, of course. In the&#xD;
      past，another study of the ours, published online in the Journal of the American Medical&#xD;
      Association Surgery, established a nomogram to predict the presence of microvascular invasion&#xD;
      in the early-stage hepatocellular carcinoma, it will efficiently predict the occurrence of&#xD;
      microvascular invasion in the hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) fulfilled the Milan criteria. In&#xD;
      consideration of the above basis, the investigators will implement a randomized controlled&#xD;
      trial to certificate whether it could really reduce the recurrence rate after liver resection&#xD;
      for participants with a high MVI risk during the surgery, if the method participants chose is&#xD;
      a wide resection margin.&#xD;
