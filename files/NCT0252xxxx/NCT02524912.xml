  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Methadone maintenance treatment (MMT) has been one of the most effective treatment choices&#xD;
      for opioid addicts to reduce their heroin use, criminality and spread of HIV. In Taiwan, MMT&#xD;
      has been introduced since 2006. To date, more than 30,000 opioid addicts have ever&#xD;
      participated in MMT, but only around 10,000 retains in treatment. Outcomes of the&#xD;
      ever-treated MMT patients remain unclear. It is crucial to trace the opioid addicts'&#xD;
      treatment career, outcomes and unmet treatment needs for the service providers to modify&#xD;
      treatment strategy to help these individual to maintain abstinence. Moreover, understanding&#xD;
      of the determinants for these subjects' long-term outcomes is important for policy makers to&#xD;
      implement realistic policies to motivate the service providers and patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      From the results of previous research, the research team found that early dropout, defined as&#xD;
      stayed in-treatment less than one month, of MMT participants were 14.4%. The rate of&#xD;
      maintaining in treatment at 3rd , 6th, and 12th month were 65.7%、51.3% and 33.8%,&#xD;
      respectively. Average treatment days for 12-month is 186.9±141.2. This result showed that the&#xD;
      effectiveness of the MMT was varied among different facilities. On the other hand, the&#xD;
      quality of the MMT can be improved largely through different dimensions. Besides, if one&#xD;
      participant can enhance its motivation in staying in-treatment, it could reduce 15% early&#xD;
      dropout. Above all, the result also showed that though the quality of life was recorded as&#xD;
      improved after MMT, it appeared to be significantly lower than their healthy counterparties.&#xD;
      The assessments of health outcomes after participating MMT are rare, but in need. It is&#xD;
      necessary to make some modification to improve the effectiveness. Moreover, the evaluation of&#xD;
      the needs shall not limit to patients, but also extend to their family members.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, in this study, the research team plans to probe the dimensions from physical,&#xD;
      psychiatric, to social conditions by assessing patients and their family members after&#xD;
      treated by MMT for five years. The research team would like to know more about the outcomes&#xD;
      of those who attended MMT five years ago, their physical and mental health conditions, also&#xD;
      health status of their family members.&#xD;
