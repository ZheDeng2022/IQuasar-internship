      We propose a randomized non-blinded comparison of standard vs. transcorporal approach for&#xD;
      placement of an artificial urinary sphincter in male patients with stress urinary&#xD;
      incontinence after radiation and radical prostatectomy for prostate cancer. In the United&#xD;
      States, the artificial urinary sphincter (AUS), manufactured by American Medical Systems, is&#xD;
      the gold standard surgical treatment for stress urinary incontinence (SUI) in men. The cuff,&#xD;
      which is the portion of the device that encircles and occludes the urethra, is typically&#xD;
      placed directly around the urethra (i.e., &quot;standard&quot; placement). The cuff can erode into the&#xD;
      urethra. Transcorporal placement has been introduced as a method to reduce the risk of&#xD;
      erosion. Transcorporal placement involves tunneling the cuff through the erectile bodies so&#xD;
      as to protect the dorsal aspect of the urethra. This approach has never been compared to&#xD;
      standard placement in a randomized fashion. In our randomized trial, no additional procedures&#xD;
      beyond the normal care protocol will be required of the patients. We will conduct the study&#xD;
      through our established, IRB-approved multi-institutional network of surgeons. Success will&#xD;
      be assessed via objective and subjective methods; complications will be tallied in a&#xD;
      standardized fashion. Outcomes will be measured at two years.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The AUS is the gold standard for treatment of severe SUI, particularly in patients following&#xD;
      surgical resection of the prostate for prostate cancer. In fact, severe urinary incontinence&#xD;
      can be the most distressing complication following radical prostatectomy and results in a&#xD;
      negative impact on quality of life (Haab, Trockman et al. 1997). Placement of an AUS has been&#xD;
      shown to result in an improved quality of life in these patients. AUSs are small devices that&#xD;
      prevent urinary flow via compression of the urethra, thus mimicking the native urinary&#xD;
      sphincter. They have been available, albeit with occasional improvements or changes in&#xD;
      design, since the 1970's. When placed in the standard fashion (ST) a small incision is made&#xD;
      in the patient's perineum or scrotum and a fluid-filled cuff is placed around the bulbar&#xD;
      urethra (the portion of the urethra between the bladder neck and penis). Connected to the&#xD;
      cuff with tubing, is a balloon filled with fluid that is placed behind the pubic bone or in&#xD;
      the space between the peritoneum and abdominal muscles. A control pump is placed in the&#xD;
      scrotum and allows the device to cycle, thus either exerting pressure to close off the&#xD;
      urethra or releasing pressure to allow the urethra to open and the patient to void. 73-76% of&#xD;
      patients will experience dramatic improvement in incontinence with very minimal leakage (0-1&#xD;
      pads per day) and 88-89% report significant improvement or cure. Two years following implant,&#xD;
      9% of patients will experience a significant decline in the functionality of the device and&#xD;
      report severe incontinence. At 5 years, 28% will need to undergo revision of the device&#xD;
      (Dalkin, Wessells et al. 2003). Long-term complications associated with the device include&#xD;
      urethral erosion in 5% of cases, urethral atrophy, infection, and mechanical failure of the&#xD;
      device.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients undergoing radical prostatectomy frequently undergo radiation treatment during the&#xD;
      course of their illness. Radiation to the pelvic region is responsible for compromising blood&#xD;
      flow to the urethra and fibrosis. As a result these patients are at a moderate risk of&#xD;
      developing complications and ultimately failure of the device necessitating removal and/or&#xD;
      replacement. Factors that put patients in a high-risk category include a history of&#xD;
      urethroplasty for urethral stricture, a history of a prior artificial urinary sphincter, and&#xD;
      a history of open surgery for bladder neck contractures (scarring at the entrance to the&#xD;
      bladder). Patients who develop a complication as listed above, often require a replacement&#xD;
      AUS in a different location than the first cuff. This is done more distally in the penis&#xD;
      where the urethra is narrower and there is less tissue to fill the cuff. This puts them at a&#xD;
      higher risk for further complications. Several authors have recently published their&#xD;
      experience with a modification to the standard technique in patients at a high risk for&#xD;
      failure (Guralnick, Miller et al. 2002) (Aaronson, Elliott et al. 2008). The modified&#xD;
      technique, termed transcorporal placement (TC), has been shown to be beneficial in this&#xD;
      subset of patients. In one study, 28% of high-risk patients with ST placement developed&#xD;
      erosion or infection, which required explanting the device compared with 13% in the TC group&#xD;
      (4). Continence was also better in this high-risk group when TC placement was used, compared&#xD;
      with ST, 89% vs 61%. TC placement also reduces the risk of injury to the urethra during&#xD;
      surgery. Unlike in ST, TC placement involves placing the device around the urethra but also&#xD;
      incorporating a flap of the tough tunica albigunea. The same incision is made as for the ST&#xD;
      approach, and then an incision is made in each corpus cavernosum (cylinders of tissue that&#xD;
      allow for erection). This allows the cuff to be placed around both the urethra and through&#xD;
      the lining of the corporal bodies, increasing the bulk of tissue behind the urethra to&#xD;
      protect it from erosion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It has been suggested that placing the cuff near the erectile tissues might cause erectile&#xD;
      dysfunction and as a result few surgeons perform this procedure on potent patients. However,&#xD;
      scant data exist to support or refute this hypothetical effect on erectile function. Despite&#xD;
      its success in patients at high risk of erosion, the TC approach has never been adequately&#xD;
      tested in patients without a high risk of failure. It is unknown if this is a technique that&#xD;
      only benefits this subset of patients or whether all patients might experience better&#xD;
      long-term continence with less risk for erosion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to improve long-term patient outcomes and reduce complications&#xD;
      and morbidity in patients with male SUI who are candidates for AUS insertion after radiation.&#xD;
      The results from this study will provide clinicians evidence for superiority of either the ST&#xD;
      or TC AUS. Our null hypothesis is that there is no difference in outcomes (as defined below)&#xD;
      for AUS done in a TC vs. ST method. The alternative hypothesis is that one procedure is&#xD;
      inferior/superior to the other.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary endpoint: AUS revision or removal surgery. These include surgery for mechanical&#xD;
      failure, cuff erosion, impending erosion (discretion of surgeon), urethral atrophy, urinary&#xD;
      incontinence and persistent retention due to small cuff.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary endpoints:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rate of post-operative urinary retention. Urinary retention defined as urinary catheter&#xD;
      placement for more than 5 days in the period between AUS implantation and AUS activation&#xD;
      (typically 4-8 weeks postoperatively) Incontinence at 3 months post-operatively measured&#xD;
      using 24-hour pad weight test. Erectile function at 3 months as measured via the Sexual&#xD;
      Health Inventory for Men (SHIM) Incontinence and QoL impact at 3 months as measured by the&#xD;
      Incontinence Severity Index (ISI) and the Incontinency Impact Questionnaire Short From&#xD;
      (IIQ-7)&#xD;
