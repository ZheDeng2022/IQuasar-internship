      The aim of this study is to explore effects of long term treatment with ACE-inhibitor on the&#xD;
      small vessel function assessed by coronary flow reserve (CFR) by transthoracic&#xD;
      echocardiography and flow mediated dilation in normotensive patients with small vessel&#xD;
      disease (CFR&lt;2.2) and Angina Pectoris but no obstructive coronary artery disease.&#xD;

      BACKGROUND Microvascular angina is proposed to be myocardial ischemia caused by microvascular&#xD;
      dysfunction. When the microvasculature is dysfunctioning, blood flow in the coronary vessels&#xD;
      does not increase sufficiently to meet oxygen demand leading to ischemia and pain. In the&#xD;
      absence of stenosis of major coronary arteries, coronary flow reserve (CFR) reflects coronary&#xD;
      microcirculation. Up to 50% of patients with angina and no obstructive coronary artery&#xD;
      disease (CAD) have impaired CFR, which is a strong predictor of poor cardiovascular&#xD;
      prognosis. Furthermore CFR has been shown to be associated with conventional risk factors;&#xD;
      among these hypertension.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ACE-inhibitor treatment of patients with Angina Pectoris and/or essential hypertension and no&#xD;
      stenosis on coronary angiogram improves CFR measured invasively by Doppler Guidewire or gas&#xD;
      chromotography suggesting an effect of ACE inhibition on the microvasculature. Studies&#xD;
      assessing the effect of ACE-inhibition in hypertensive and mild coronary artery disease&#xD;
      patients with CFR assessed by positron emission tomography (PET) showed divergent results.&#xD;
      One study showed an improvement on both resting and hyperaemic myocardial blood flow ,&#xD;
      another showed an increased myocardial perfusion reserve post treatment and a third failed to&#xD;
      show any significant effect. If the effect seen on CFR is indirectly mediated via treatment&#xD;
      of hypertension or if ACE-inhibition has a direct effect on the microvasculature continues to&#xD;
      be uncertain in patients with microvascular angina. Some studies show an effect on CFR in&#xD;
      both normotensive and hypertensive patients with microvascular angina whereas other studies&#xD;
      only show an effect in hypertensive patients and not in normotensive. Treating patients with&#xD;
      diabetes and a CFR&gt;2.0 with ACE-inhibitor has also proven efficient in increasing CFR&#xD;
      measured by transthoracic Doppler echocardiography (TTDE) supporting the theory that&#xD;
      ACE-inhibition could have a direct effect on the microvasculature. In animal studies&#xD;
      ACE-inhibition has shown capability of preventing adverse vascular remodelling dissociated to&#xD;
      its blood pressure lowering effect. ACE inhibitor treatment is thought to be associated with&#xD;
      vascular changes in CAD patients. However Clinical trials have shown discrepant results&#xD;
      regarding reduction of hard endpoints with ACE inhibition in high-risk CAD patients. It&#xD;
      remains unclear if ACE-inhibition has a direct effect on the microvasculature in normotensive&#xD;
      patients with microvascular angina.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Endothelial dysfunction assessed by Flow-dependent endothelium-mediated dilation (FMD) is&#xD;
      associated with cardiovascular risk factors and more prominent in women. FMD predicts long&#xD;
      term cardiovascular events in healthy subjects. Treatment with most types of ACE-inhibitors&#xD;
      improves FMD shown in studies with patients with syndrome X, coronary artery disease, and&#xD;
      hypertension and in healthy elderly. However Enalapril treatment did not show an affect on&#xD;
      FMD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AIM The aim of this study is to explore effects of long term treatment with ACE-inhibitor on&#xD;
      the microvasculature and endothelial function assessed by coronary flow reserve (CFR) by&#xD;
      transthoracic echocardiography and flow mediated dilation (FMD) in normotensive patients with&#xD;
      microvascular dysfunction (CFR&lt;2.2) and Angina Pectoris but NO-CAD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HYPOTHESIS ACE inhibitor treatment reverts microvascular remodelling and endothelial&#xD;
      dysfunction in patients with microvascular dysfunction and Angina Pectoris but NO-CAD thereby&#xD;
      improving microvascular function and reducing symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RESEARCH DESIGN The study is a randomised double-blinded interventional study. 72 patients&#xD;
      with microvascular dysfunction assessed by TTDE as a CFR&lt;2.2 are recruited from the iPower&#xD;
      (ImProve diagnOsis and treatment of Women with angina pEctoris and micRovessel disease)&#xD;
      cohort (women with angina but no obstructive CAD examined with TTDE CFR), Region Zealand.&#xD;
      Patients with hypertension will be excluded from the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients will be randomised to group 1 or 2:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Group 1: Oral ACE-inhibitor for 6±1,5 months&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Group 2: Oral matching placebo for 6±1,5 months Examinations and measurements will be&#xD;
           performed at baseline and after 6±1,5 months. There are furthermore 2 possible blood&#xD;
           pressure (BP)/kidney function control visits depending on how many up titrations of&#xD;
           treatment medicine are necessary for the individual patient. Compliance calls and&#xD;
           control of adverse events will be made every month and the patient can also contact us&#xD;
           with any concern.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participation in the study is 6±1,5 months. 24 hours before final measurements Ramipril&#xD;
      treatment will be discontinued. Ramipril treatment will be add-on to usual treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RANDOMIZATION PROCEDURE Patients will be randomized into 2 equal groups receiving either&#xD;
      Ramipril or placebo. Randomization is done by the pharmacy (Glostrup Apotek). ACIM (Effect of&#xD;
      ACE-Inhibition on Microvascular Function in Women with Assessed Microvascular Dysfunction)&#xD;
      Id-numbers (ACIM1-72) are allocated equally to either placebo or Ramipril treatment using&#xD;
      simple randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization is concealed in a document sealed in an opaque envelope and can only be&#xD;
      revealed at the end of the study. For individual patients in occurrence of a serious adverse&#xD;
      event the sponsor or investigator will contact the pharmacy to reveal medication type. The&#xD;
      sealed envelope will be locked in a cabinet at the office of the sponsor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sponsor, investigator, research assistant and patients will have no knowledge of which&#xD;
      randomization group the patients belong to Id-numbers (ACIM1-72) will be allocated to&#xD;
      patients in a consecutive order.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TRIAL MEDICINE AND BLINDING Study medication will be prepared by the pharmacy (Glostrup&#xD;
      Apotek) in a double-blinded manner. Medication will be delivered in bottles containing 50/100&#xD;
      x 5 mg placebo tablets or 5 mg Ramipril (Ramipril®, Hexal) and both bottle containers and&#xD;
      tablets are indistinguishable. Tablets are produced with a pressure sensitive score notch and&#xD;
      can be divided into equal halves. Bottle containers will be labelled with a study id-number&#xD;
      ACIM1-ACIM72 (identification number/treatment number), the batch and/or code number to&#xD;
      identify the contents and packaging operation, the name of the investigator Marie&#xD;
      Michelsen/research assistant and mobile number, pharmaceutical dosage form, route of&#xD;
      administration, quantity of dosage units, indication of use: &quot;clinical trial&quot;, the storage&#xD;
      conditions, period of use (expiry date) and warning label: &quot;keep out of reach of children&quot;.&#xD;
      The directions for use will be made to a leaflet according to individual dosage because of&#xD;
      different final dosage after up titrations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In both the placebo and Ramipril group medication will start with either 2,5 mg (BP&lt;130) or 5&#xD;
      mg (BP&gt;130) daily. After 2-3 weeks the dose is doubled to 5 mg or 10 mg unless blood pressure&#xD;
      is below 115 mmHg. If blood pressure continues to be higher than 115 mmHg for patients up&#xD;
      titrated to 5 mg treatment dose will be doubled to 10 mg at the third visit. Blood pressure&#xD;
      and kidney function will be controlled at each visit (see fig. 1). If patients have symptoms&#xD;
      of hypotension (dizziness, syncope or high pulse) treatment dose will be reduced and/or other&#xD;
      blood pressure lowering treatment discontinued or if necessary Ramipril treatment&#xD;
      discontinued.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If oral ACE-inhibitors are not tolerated treatment will be discontinued. Regarding exclusion&#xD;
      for treatment discontinuation please see &quot;withdrawal criteria&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients taking a dose of&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  2,5 mg will take a half tablet a day&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  5 mg will take one whole tablet a day&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  10 mg will take two tablets a day Patients will be up titrated in same manner&#xD;
           independent of which medication they are on. For each study id-number medication for up&#xD;
           titration is available. Patients will receive the appropriate amount of bottles&#xD;
           according to uptitrated dose level (annex 1).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be up titrated and monitored by a research assistant so the investigator making&#xD;
      the primary endpoint measure is unaware of the final treatment dose. In case of any adverse&#xD;
      events/reactions or serious events/reactions the research assistant will confer with the&#xD;
      sponsor or a project physician if necessary and not the investigator to avoid awareness of&#xD;
      medication type for person obtaining primary endpoint. Only in case of a suspected serious&#xD;
      reaction medication type will be unblinded by the sponsor or investigator by calling the&#xD;
      pharmacy, Døgnåbent Glostrup Apotek, with patients id/cpr-number. Regarding exclusion for&#xD;
      unblinding please see &quot;withdrawal criteria&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis of echocardiographic measurements for primary and secondary measurements will be&#xD;
      made minimum 1 month after baseline and final visit so the investigator is unaware of blood&#xD;
      pressure measurements during examinations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Control of compliance will be made at visits and hereafter every month by patient structured&#xD;
      open questions interviews (visits and telephone) Furthermore patients will make a diary every&#xD;
      day of pill intake and any symptoms (potential adverse effects).&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of the study the patient will return used pill containers with remaining tablets&#xD;
      within. These will be counted again to ensure medication compliance and accuracy.&#xD;
