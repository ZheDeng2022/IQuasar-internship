  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, study to evaluate the safety and&#xD;
      tolerability of Nexvax2 preceded by dose titration period in patients with celiac disease&#xD;
      currently on a gluten-free diet. The study will consist of a Screening Period, a Treatment&#xD;
      Period, and a Follow-up Period. Eligible subjects will be enrolled in one of three cohorts&#xD;
      according to whether they are homozygous or not homozygous for both genes coding for&#xD;
      HLA-DQ2.5.&#xD;

             diagnosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Subject has HLA DQ2.5 genotype (HLA-DQA1*05 and HLA-DQB1*02).&#xD;
