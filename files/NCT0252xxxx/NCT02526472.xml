  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      One thousand, six hundred forty-eight IVF patients undergoing ET with fresh embryos,&#xD;
      randomized to receive mTVET (n=828) or UGET (n=820). The transfer in uteri of 1-2 embryos on&#xD;
      day 2-3 of culture was performed using a soft catheter either under trans-abdominal US&#xD;
      guidance (UGET group) or after measurement of uterine cavity by transvaginal US and&#xD;
      calculation of the discharge site (mTVET). Mai outcome measures was the clinical pregnancy&#xD;
      rate (CPR), secondary outcomes were the implantation rate (IR), and the patient's discomfort&#xD;
      during ET procedure.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All patients undergoing IVF and ending the cycle with the transfer of fresh embryos at&#xD;
      investigators' IVF Unit in a 3-years period (n=1824) were proposed to join the study. One&#xD;
      hundred forty-six eligible patients refused to sign the consent and were excluded. Overall,&#xD;
      1678 patients accepted to participate in the study and the day of ET were randomized with a&#xD;
      1:1 ratio into two groups using a computer-generated unrestricted randomization: 866 patients&#xD;
      were scheduled to undergo UGET, whereas 872 patients were scheduled to receive mTVET. During&#xD;
      ET, 90 patients (44 in mTVET group and 46 in UGET group) required to change the catheter for&#xD;
      cervical stenosis and consequently were excluded from the analysis. Finally, data of 1648&#xD;
      patients (828 in mTVET group vs. 820 in UGET group) were analyzed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All cases included in the final analysis were transfers performed on day 2-3 with fresh&#xD;
      embryos deriving from autologous IVF. Transfers with frozen embryos and cases in which&#xD;
      blastocyst transfer was scheduled were not selected as eligible; donor IVF cycles were not&#xD;
      legal in Italy at the time of the study. According to the investigators' usual clinical&#xD;
      practice, no mock or trial embryo transfer was performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patient was placed in the lithotomy position, and the cervix was exposed using a&#xD;
      speculum. Then, the cervix was gently cleaned using saline solution and the cervical mucus&#xD;
      leaking out from the cervical os was removed using a wet gauze.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to avoid any bias linked to the operator's experience and skill, all ETs included in&#xD;
      the study were performed by three experienced doctors that used the same soft catheter&#xD;
      (Sydney®Cook, Melbourne, Australia) loaded by experienced biologists with a constant amount&#xD;
      (20 μl) of culture medium. The Sydney catheter was used for all randomized patients, but if&#xD;
      cervical stenosis was encountered and ET was difficult, the catheter was changed shifting to&#xD;
      a stiffer one. Neither a tenaculum, nor suture points placed on the cervix to pull it were&#xD;
      used. All cases with change of the catheter were excluded from the final analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A gentle and slow insertion of the stiffer outer sheath of the catheter was performed, and&#xD;
      after inserting the softer inner cannula carrying the embryos, they were gently discharged&#xD;
      and the catheter was retracted very slowly. The catheter was immediately and carefully&#xD;
      checked under a microscope and if embryos were retained, they were re-harvested to&#xD;
      immediately repeat the transfer procedure. These cases were included in the final analysis.&#xD;
      The presence of blood inside the cannula was registered. The overall time needed to perform&#xD;
      ET (defined as the time elapsed since the loaded catheter was handed by the physician to the&#xD;
      time it was returned to the biologist after embryo discharge) was measured and registered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When UGET was used, a second physician assisted the ET performing trans-abdominal US, and the&#xD;
      embryos were discharged when the tip of the catheter was visualized approximately at 1,5 cm&#xD;
      from the fundal endometrial surface, which was observed to be the best replacement site&#xD;
      according to a previous research by the investigators' group (6).&#xD;
&#xD;
      When mTVET was scheduled, the physician performed a transvaginal US scan using a 6.5&#xD;
      mega-hertz (MHz) transvaginal probe just before ET, visualized the uterus in a sagittal&#xD;
      plane, measured the length of the cervix and of the uterine cavity, and calculated the&#xD;
      distance between the internal uterine os and the fundal endometrial surface. Then, the probe&#xD;
      was taken away from the vagina, a speculum was inserted and ET was performed inserting the&#xD;
      inner cannula of the Sydney catheter (that has length markers on it) in order to discharge&#xD;
      embryos at a point obtained subtracting 1.5 cm from the total length of the cavity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Immediately after either UGET or mTVET, the position of the echogenic spot(s) inside the&#xD;
      uterus, corresponding to air bubbles loaded with the embryos, was checked by trans-vaginal&#xD;
      US, and after waiting approximately 30 seconds its distance (or the distance of a virtual&#xD;
      point in the middle of two spots) from the fundal endometrial surface was measured, obtaining&#xD;
      the final position of embryo replacement.&#xD;
