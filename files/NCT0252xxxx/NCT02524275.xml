      This phase II trial studies the side effects and how well docetaxel and capecitabine work in&#xD;
      treating patients with squamous cell (thin, flat cells) carcinoma of the head and neck that&#xD;
      has come back or spread to other places in the body. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as&#xD;
      docetaxel and capecitabine, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either&#xD;
      by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate in a phase II study the efficacy (the radiographic assessment of disease&#xD;
      status after 2 cycles of therapy) of a combination of docetaxel and capecitabine in subjects&#xD;
      with advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck who are not candidates for surgery&#xD;
      or radiation therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To evaluate the safety and toxicities of docetaxel and capecitabine in subjects with&#xD;
      advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To descriptively examine the effects of the combination of docetaxel and capecitabine on&#xD;
      the quality of life of subjects with advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive docetaxel intravenously (IV) over 1 hour on day 1 and capecitabine orally&#xD;
      (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 1-14. Courses repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease&#xD;
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 30 days and then&#xD;
      periodically thereafter.&#xD;
