  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Routine screening mammography has increased the non-palpable suspicious lesion detection&#xD;
      rate, requiring histopathological evaluation. The discovery of atypical lesions on the breast&#xD;
      biopsy is associated with two interrelated risks:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The risk of underestimating the severity of the lesion biopsied currently leads&#xD;
           systematically to achieve a surgical resection for these patients while a breast cancer&#xD;
           (BC) will finally identified at surgery in 10 to 25% of cases. Thus, unnecessary&#xD;
           surgeries will be performed in 75 to 90% of cases (no cancer).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. These breast lesions confer long-term increase in the subsequent risk of breast cancer&#xD;
           (cumulative incidence of 15 to 25% at 25 years). Thus, women identified with atypical&#xD;
           lesions are then followed using clinical and mammographic annual evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goal would be to get a model to assess the risk and no longer operate those patients at&#xD;
      high risk of BC. Several groups have attempted to identify predictors of concurrent or&#xD;
      secondary BC associated with the discovery of an unusual lesion at biopsy. However, they are&#xD;
      often focused on a subtype of atypia (eg atypical metaplasia, atypical ductal hyperplasia,&#xD;
      atypical lobular hyperplasia) and no prediction model has been validated in prospective&#xD;
      multicenter. Based on a large retrospective study at Gustave Roussy, a prediction model&#xD;
      (Nomat) has been developed, common to all atypical lesions, which can predict the presence of&#xD;
      a BC at excision surgery (risk of concurrent BC). This model is based on the age of the&#xD;
      patient, the disappearance of radiographic abnormalities (microcalcifications in general)&#xD;
      after the biopsy and initial radiological lesion size. This model has good performance with&#xD;
      an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.72. In previous series, with a BC high-risk threshold of&#xD;
      20%, negative predictive value was 90%, and this model would have prevented the surgery in&#xD;
      51% of patients (low risk patients by model). It is essential to validate this model by&#xD;
      forward-looking and in different centers to ensure its relevance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a multicenter prospective validation of the model on 300 patients operated for&#xD;
      atypical lesions in 21 centers. All patients with atypical breast lesions have a routine&#xD;
      surgery. The clinical data, imaging and histological data will be collected prospectively.&#xD;
      The main objective of this study is to validate the model Nomat.&#xD;
