  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Rationale: Tardive dyskinesia and dystonia (TDD) are severe side effects of dopamine blocking&#xD;
      agents, particularly antipsychotics. Deep brain stimulation (DBS) has shown to be effective&#xD;
      in the treatment of TDD in psychiatric patients, but only reported in case reports and small&#xD;
      clinical trials and with little attention to possible psychiatric or cognitive complications&#xD;
      or positive effect on psychiatric symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: To assess whether treatment with DBS can reduce or resolve TDD and if DBS can&#xD;
      induce beneficial or side-effects in particular psychiatric symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design: A delayed onset double blind randomised controlled trial. Study population:&#xD;
      Adult patients with a current or previous psychiatric disorder and antipsychotic induced TDD&#xD;
      with a stable psychiatric status during the past 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention: All patients will be treated with DBS in the posteroventrolateral GPi. The&#xD;
      groups will be randomised into immediate stimulation or delayed stimulation after 3 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main study parameters/endpoints: Primary objective, improvement on the movement rating scales&#xD;
      BFMDRS. Secondary objectives improvement on the quality of life measured on the SF-36,&#xD;
      psychiatric stability as measured on the BPRS and the MADRS and cognitive effects as measured&#xD;
      on the MATTIS Dementia Rating Scale, Nederlandse Leestest voor Volwassenen (NLV), 15 word&#xD;
      test, Facial Expression of Emotion S+T (FEEST), Groninger Intelligentie Test woordopnoemen&#xD;
      (GIT), category and letter fluency test, Trail Making Test part A and B and the Stroop colour&#xD;
      and word test&#xD;
