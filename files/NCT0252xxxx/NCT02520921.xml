      To compare treatment with Aspirin Protect® twice a day (100 mg in the morning and 100 mg in&#xD;
      the evening) versus Aspirin Protect® 100 mg once per day on a composite end-point of ischemic&#xD;
      events in diabetic patients, or in patients with a known risk factor for non-optimal aspirin&#xD;
      response (obesity, abdominal obesity or coronary event occurring with long-term aspirin),with&#xD;
      acute coronary syndrome. It is expected that aspirin taken twice a day will reduce the&#xD;
      occurrence of new ischemic event after acute coronary syndrome in diabetic patients or in&#xD;
      patients with a known risk factor.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients who show high persistent platelet reactivity under aspirin are increasingly becoming&#xD;
      an issue of clinical concern. Several studies have suggested that giving aspirin more&#xD;
      frequently is very effective for reducing aspirin high persistent platelet reactivity,&#xD;
      especially in diabetic patientsor in patients with a known risk factor. The aim of the study&#xD;
      is to evaluate low dose of aspirin twice a day (compared to once a day) for the reduction of&#xD;
      ischemic events in diabetic patients or in patients with a known risk factor, with acute&#xD;
      coronary syndrome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experimental Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A multicenter, randomised, parallel group comparing aspirin given twice a day compared to&#xD;
      once per day in diabetic patients, or in patients with a known risk factor for non-optimal&#xD;
      aspirin response (obesity, abdominal obesity or coronary event occurring with long-term&#xD;
      aspirin),with acute coronary syndrome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To compare treatment with Aspirin Protect® twice a day (100 mg in the morning and 100 mg in&#xD;
      the evening) versus Aspirin Protect® 100 mg once per day on a composite end-point of ischemic&#xD;
      events in diabetic patients, or in patients with a known risk factor for non-optimal aspirin&#xD;
      response (obesity, abdominal obesity or coronary event occurring with long-term aspirin),with&#xD;
      acute coronary syndrome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To compare treatment with Aspirin Protect® twice a day (100 mg in the morning and 100 mg&#xD;
           in the evening) versus Aspirin Protect® 100 mg once per day on net clinical benefit&#xD;
           combining the ischemic and bleeding events in diabetic patients, or in patients with a&#xD;
           known risk factor for non-optimal aspirin response (obesity, abdominal obesity or&#xD;
           coronary event occurring with long-term aspirin),with acute coronary syndrome.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To compare treatment with Aspirin Protect® twice a day (100 mg in the morning and 100 mg&#xD;
           in the evening) versus Aspirin Protect® 100 mg once per day on cardiac events in&#xD;
           diabetic patients, or in patients with a known risk factor for non-optimal aspirin&#xD;
           response (obesity, abdominal obesity or coronary event occurring with long-term&#xD;
           aspirin),with acute coronary syndrome.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To compare treatment with Aspirin Protect® twice a day (100 mg in the morning and 100 mg&#xD;
           in the evening) versus Aspirin Protect® 100 mg once per day in each of individual&#xD;
           component of the main criterion.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To confirm the safety of the innovative strategy (aspirin twice a day) concerning major&#xD;
           bleeding events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study enrollment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Multicentric national study involving 42 centers in France The duration is expected to be 24&#xD;
      months of recruitment. Patients will be randomized during the index hospitalization for acute&#xD;
      coronary syndrome and before discharge between a conventional strategy of enteric coated&#xD;
      aspirin 100mg per day with the standard of care or a innovative strategy of enteric coated&#xD;
      aspirin 100mg morning and evening. Patients will be followed at one month, six months, one&#xD;
      year and 18 months&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will include 2574 patients. We hypothesized that at 18 months, there will be an&#xD;
      event rate of 22% for &quot;death, MI, stroke, urgent revascularization, or acute arterial&#xD;
      thrombotic event in the group treated with aspirin and we expect a decrease of the primary&#xD;
      event of 20% (relative variation) using aspirin twice a day corresponding to an event rate of&#xD;
      17.6%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A sample size of 1287 patients /group will allow an 80% power to detect this difference using&#xD;
      a log-rank test at a two-sided 5% significance level. The study will include 2574 diabetic&#xD;
      patients, or patients with a known risk factor for non-optimal aspirin response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary analysis is based on the Intention To Treat population and the primary endpoint.&#xD;
      The primary analysis on the primary endpoint will be carried out using a log-rank test for&#xD;
      survival analysis. The 95% confidence interval of the hazard ratio will be presented. In&#xD;
      addition the survival status during 18 months follow-up will be described by showing&#xD;
      Kaplan-Meier curves.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary outcome according to pre-specified subgroups:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Age: patients &lt; 75 years or patient ≥75 years&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Gender: male or female&#xD;
