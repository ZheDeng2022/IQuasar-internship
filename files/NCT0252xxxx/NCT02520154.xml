    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well pembrolizumab works when given in combination with&#xD;
      carboplatin and paclitaxel in treating patients with stage III-IV ovarian, primary&#xD;
      peritoneal, or fallopian tube cancer. Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as&#xD;
      pembrolizumab, may help the body's immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere with&#xD;
      the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as&#xD;
      carboplatin and paclitaxel, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either&#xD;
      by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading.&#xD;
      Giving pembrolizumab in combination with carboplatin and paclitaxel may be a better treatment&#xD;
      for ovarian, primary peritoneal, or fallopian tube cancer.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate progression-free survival of paclitaxel/carboplatin and pembrolizumab in&#xD;
      patients with advanced stage, metastatic ovarian cancer undergoing neoadjuvant chemotherapy&#xD;
      (NACT).&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To describe the feasibility of combination therapy with pembrolizumab in this population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To evaluate the safety of combination and maintenance pembrolizumab. III. To report&#xD;
      overall survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To describe the sequential effects of chemotherapy on immune response and PD-1 expression&#xD;
      and receptor occupancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To evaluate circulating lymphoid populations (subsets). III. To determine tissue PD-L1&#xD;
      expression and T-cell infiltration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      NACT: Patients receive paclitaxel intravenously (IV) over 1 hour on days 1, 8, and 15, and&#xD;
      carboplatin IV over 1 hour on day 1. Treatment repeats every 21 days for 3 cycles in the&#xD;
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients then undergo surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ADJUVANT THERAPY: Beginning 3-6 weeks after surgery, paclitaxel IV over 1 hour on days 1, 8,&#xD;
      and 15, patients receive carboplatin IV over 1 hour on day 1, and pembrolizumab IV over 30&#xD;
      minutes on day 1. Treatment repeats every 21 days for 3 cycles in the absence of disease&#xD;
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MAINTENANCE THERAPY: Patients receive pembrolizumab IV over 30 minutes on day 1. Treatment&#xD;
      repeats every 21 days for up to 20 cycles in the absence of disease progression or&#xD;
      unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 12 weeks.&#xD;
