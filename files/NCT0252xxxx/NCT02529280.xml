    <textblock>
      &quot;Increasing Access of Latinas into Breast Cancer Clinical Trials&quot; aims to develop and pilot&#xD;
      test a multi-communications approach - using a culturally relevant computer video, a tailored&#xD;
      booklet and a patient navigator (PN) - to empower Latinas to make informed decisions about&#xD;
      breast cancer clinical trials (BCCTs). Latinos represent 15% of the U.S. population but only&#xD;
      5.6% of participants in National Cancer Institute (NCI) treatment clinical trials, resulting&#xD;
      in disparities in cancer outcomes and jeopardizing the generalizability of trial findings. In&#xD;
      response, this study will develop and evaluate communication and health-system-change&#xD;
      strategies to facilitate Latinas' access to BCCTs at the Cancer Therapy and Research Center&#xD;
      at The University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio (CTRC-UTHSCSA). The&#xD;
      CTRC-UTHSCSA, an NCI-designated Cancer Center located in South Texas, serves a culturally and&#xD;
      ethnically diverse population that historically has low participation in clinical trials,&#xD;
      especially among those with breast cancer, the No. 1 cancer killer of Latinas.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This study features a cohort design with random assignment of 112 Latina breast cancer&#xD;
      patients from the CTRC to an intervention (56) or usual care control group (56). The&#xD;
      intervention group will receive three components: 1) a culturally sensitive and individually&#xD;
      tailored, 30-minute computer-based BCCT educational video; 2) a bilingual, low literacy&#xD;
      booklet that encourages patients to communicate with family and friends; and 3) support from&#xD;
      a patient navigator. The usual care control group will receive usual care breast cancer&#xD;
      clinical trial information materials offered by the CTRC to its eligible patients. The&#xD;
      intervention is based in two proven theories - Stages of Change and Social Cognitive Theory -&#xD;
      and will feature basic components of individual empowerment, including knowledge, attitudes,&#xD;
      skills and self-efficacy beliefs and expectations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study has three main phases: Phase 1: Formative Research; Phase 2: Intervention; and&#xD;
      Phase 3: Evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Purpose:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To empower Latinas to make informed decisions about breast cancer clinical trials (BCCTs) by&#xD;
      enhancing their knowledge, attitudes, skills and self-efficacy required to support discussion&#xD;
      of CT as a treatment option with doctors and family members.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Increase patient education and awareness, positive attitudes and self-efficacy to&#xD;
           enhance their decision-making skills to participate in BCCTs.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Provide decisional support to make an informed decision regarding participation in BCCTs&#xD;
           by encouraging discussion of BCCTs as a treatment option with medical team, family and&#xD;
           friends.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Test the efficacy of a multi-communication intervention to assist Latina breast cancer&#xD;
           patients in their decision making process regarding participation in BCCTs.&#xD;

    <description>Intervention includes 1) a 30-minute computer-based video (in English/Spanish), featuring instructional screens, graphics and animation to help participants understand the concepts presented. It will feature breast cancer patients who have participated in CTs, patients talking to their doctor or nurse and a bilingual narrator to guide participants. Video content will address common barriers and concerns regarding clinical trials, as well as the informed consent process, and how clinical trials are monitored and reviewed; 2) a bilingual easy to understand booklet with tailored information on clinical trials. The booklet will include many of the elements and messages featured in the video program; and 3) assistance from a trained, bilingual, bicultural, nurse navigator.</description>
