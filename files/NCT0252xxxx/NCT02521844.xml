  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1A/B study consisting of four parts.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Part A (completed) is a non-randomised, open-label, sequential evaluation of the safety,&#xD;
           pharmacokinetics (PK), maximum tolerated dose (MTD), and recommended dose (RD) of&#xD;
           ETC-1922159 in patients with advanced or metastatic, or unresectable solid malignancies,&#xD;
           for whom no approved treatment option or standard of care is available. Dose escalation,&#xD;
           with the goal of identifying the MTD and RD, is guided by an ordinal continual&#xD;
           reassessment method (oCRM) model with a cohort size of one patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Part A extension (completed) is a non-randomised, non-comparative, open-label evaluation&#xD;
           of the safety and tolerability of ETC-1922159 together with the bone protective&#xD;
           treatment (denosumab) in patients with advanced or metastatic, or unresectable solid&#xD;
           malignancies, for whom no approved treatment option or standard of care is available.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Part B dose escalation will be a non-randomised, open-label, sequential evaluation of&#xD;
           the MTD, RD, safety, PK, and PD (pharmacodynamics) of ETC 1922159 in combination with&#xD;
           pembrolizumab in patients with advanced or metastatic, or unresectable solid&#xD;
           malignancies, for whom no approved treatment option or standard of care is available.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Part B dose expansion will be a non-randomised, non-comparative, open-label study&#xD;
           evaluation of the safety and tolerability of ETC-1922159 as a single agent until disease&#xD;
           progression and then in combination with pembrolizumab at the RD identified in the Part&#xD;
           B dose escalation segment, in patients with advanced or metastatic, or unresectable&#xD;
           solid malignancies that are refractory, intolerant or not suitable for available&#xD;
           treatment according to the treating physician.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is anticipated that the study will take approximately 78 months to complete (36 months for&#xD;
      Part A and Part A Extension, approximately 6 months for Part B dose escalation and&#xD;
      approximately 36 months for Part B dose expansion).&#xD;
