      Study Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aims to assess the feasibility and acceptability of an application utilising&#xD;
      Acceptance and Commitment Therapy in young people with type 1 diabetes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Research Questions:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Is an ACT based application feasible and acceptable to young people with type 1 diabetes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will use the app for four weeks and then be invited to attend an interview&#xD;
      discussing the acceptability, usability and feasibility of the app. Clinician's will also be&#xD;
      invited to take part in a workshop where they interact with the app and provide feedback.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Consent for will be obtained through the app. Additional consent for the recording of&#xD;
      interviews will be obtained in paper format and stored in a secure locked cabinet at&#xD;
      Edinburgh University.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Quantitative data will also be collected on well-being, psychological flexibility, and data&#xD;
      usage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Collection&#xD;
&#xD;
      Qualitative feedback:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interviews will be recorded and transcribed using unique identifiers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome measures and data usage patterns:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will be collected on a password protected database which can only be obtained via a&#xD;
      password protected and encrypted server from University of Edinburgh.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;

      Study Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The diabetes teams will select participants who meet inclusion criterion and the team will&#xD;
      provide them with information leaflets. The information sheets will include contact details&#xD;
      of the research team should any queries arise and contact details of somebody independent&#xD;
      from the study. Parents/guardians of volunteers between 13-16 years old will also be able to&#xD;
      access the information leaflet so they are aware of the study that their child has&#xD;
      volunteered to participate in. The information leaflets will provide information surrounding&#xD;
      consent. The information sheets will include a uniform resource locator (URL) where patients&#xD;
      who have been selected by their diabetes teams will volunteer to download the app (SweetSpot)&#xD;
      from.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once the individual downloads the application or provided with an Android device by the&#xD;
      University, they will be required to provide contact details for themselves, their GP and&#xD;
      diabetes teams. This is so GP's can be made aware of the patients participation and so&#xD;
      diabetes teams can be informed if the research team have concerns regarding an individual.&#xD;
      Additionally, participants can be informed of any relevant developments throughout the study&#xD;
      and this can be the forum to disseminate findings from the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All identifiable data will be stored electronically on a secure local server and password&#xD;
      protected database. Any data removed from this database will be partially identifiable&#xD;
      through a unique identifier (UID) which will link the two data sets. Analysis will be&#xD;
      conducted on fully anonymised data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants who have volunteered to take part in the study will have approximately four&#xD;
      weeks to use the app and will be requested to attended an interview to provide feedback on&#xD;
      the feasibility and user-friendliness of the app. As well as obtaining consent through the&#xD;
      app, patients participating in this phase will provide consent to participate in the focus&#xD;
      group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additionally, clinicians in the field will be aware of workshops for clinicians to interact&#xD;
      with the app. This will be due to the chief investigator attending meetings explaining the&#xD;
      study. A follow-up email will be disseminated to the teams with an information sheet and&#xD;
      clinicians can volunteer to attend a workshop where they can use the app and provide feedback&#xD;
      on the acceptability and feasibility of SweetSpot. Consent will be obtained at the workshop&#xD;
      from clinicians.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The general format which each individual will follow contains 6 chapters with individual&#xD;
      sessions which have been adapted from &quot;ACT for diabetes self-management&quot; manual. These&#xD;
      include:&#xD;

      Study Population:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study aims to recruit 12 participants from NHS Lothian, NHS Glasgow &amp; Clyde, NHS Fourth&#xD;
      Valley, NHS Dumfries &amp; Galloway, NHS Borders, and NHS Lanarkshire.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Identifying Participants:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinician's from diabetes teams in the NHS boards involved will identify patients who meet&#xD;
      inclusion criteria and competent to provide consent. These participants will be provided with&#xD;
      information leaflets when they attend their regular NHS clinic appointment. A volunteer&#xD;
      sample from those selected will pilot SweetSpot. Information leaflets will be available to&#xD;
      parents/guardians of patients who are younger than 16 years old. An email address for the&#xD;
      chief investigator and a person independent from the research team will also be included in&#xD;
      the information leaflet.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Consent Process:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The information sheet containing the URL will state that if they download SweetSpot they are&#xD;
      consenting to being involved in an interview to feedback their experience of using SweetSpot&#xD;
      which will be recorded and used for research purposes. Participants will be asked to provide&#xD;
      their email or phone number so the interview can be arranged, and for future contact should&#xD;
      any additional information relevant to the research become available, they will be informed&#xD;
      of this and so results can be disseminated via email. The chief investigator will introduce&#xD;
      the study to Psychologists in the diabetes network and will visit diabetes teams who have&#xD;
      shown an interest in the study to explain it in more detail to the whole team. Further to&#xD;
      this an email will be disseminated to NHS diabetes clinicians regarding an educational&#xD;
      workshop which introduces SweetSpot, allows clinicians to use SweetSpot and generates&#xD;
      feedback from Clinicians regarding acceptability, feasibility and user-friendliness of the&#xD;
      app. The workshop will have an information leaflet which will explain that by attending the&#xD;
      workshop clinicians are consenting to being involved in a focus group to feedback their&#xD;
      experience of using SweetSpot which will be recorded and used for research purposes and a&#xD;
      subsequent consent form will be required to be completed at the workshops. It was deemed&#xD;
      vital that formative work was conducted in collaboration with targeted users and service&#xD;
      providers. Participants will be required to fill in a consent form before the workshops and&#xD;
      focus groups. They are required to provide consent for two issues once they volunteer to&#xD;
      download the app: 1. to consent to providing contact information of themselves, GP and&#xD;
      diabetes team, 2. to consent to their data being used for research purposes. If they do not&#xD;
      consent to both these issues they will not be able to access the app content.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There will be direct questions within the app which address consent:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Do you consent to your diabetes team being informed of your participation in this study,&#xD;
           and that further contact will be made if any concerns about your well-being arise?&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Do you consent to your data being used for research purposes in this study? If the&#xD;
           participant responds no to question 1 or 2, then they will not be able to access the&#xD;
           app. The GP and diabetes team will still be informed of their participation in the&#xD;
           study. An information leaflet given to potential participants by their health care team&#xD;
           will also cover consent issues.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A statement in the information sheets will also state:&#xD;
&#xD;
      By downloading the app you are consent that &quot;I understand that relevant sections of my&#xD;
      medical notes and data collected during the study may be looked at by individuals from the&#xD;
      Sponsor (University of Edinburgh), from the NHS organisation or other authorities, where it&#xD;
      is relevant to my taking part in this research. I give permission for these individuals to&#xD;
      have access to my records.&quot;&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Collection:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A unique identifier (UID) is assigned to each participant's data. All data will be stored&#xD;
      electronically on an encrypted firewall protected secure local server and password protected&#xD;
      database. The measures used to assess effectiveness of the application for self-monitoring&#xD;
      behaviours are self-report of blood glucose measurements, insulin injecting, diet and&#xD;
      physical exercise imputed daily. The outcome measures will be well-being, diabetes related&#xD;
      distress and self-care behaviours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Analysis for Qualitative Data:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The interviews and the workshop will be transcribed and the audio recording will be deleted.&#xD;
      Framework analysis will be utilised for the workshop. Interpretive phenomenological analysis&#xD;
      will be used for the interviews. This is because these types of analysis lies within the&#xD;
      phenomenological school of thought, attempting to understand beliefs and attitudes about a&#xD;
      topic. Therefore adopting a realist approach which assumes participants are reporting the&#xD;
      truth in their experience. Within the realist framework an inductive approach is adopted to&#xD;
      ensure interpretations were grounded in the data. It allows for themes to be generated&#xD;
      through the research questions but also from the narratives provided by the participants.&#xD;
      Framework analysis aims to report patterns within the data by using a systematic way to&#xD;
      interpret information. The method uses a matrix which blends empirical investigation in&#xD;
      creative study. Framework analysis has been found useful in analysing focus groups. Themes&#xD;
      produced will identify amendments which need to be made for the intervention stage of the&#xD;
      study. Interpretive phenomenological analysis is a useful analysis for individual interviews&#xD;
      as it generates an in-depth analysis of a person's experience.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Analysis for Quantitative Data:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A simple t-test analysis will be conducted if the data is normally distributed, or&#xD;
      Wilcoxon-sign if the data is non-normally distributed.&#xD;
