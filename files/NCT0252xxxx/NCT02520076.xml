  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Islet transplantation is a relatively new procedure used in people with difficult to control&#xD;
      Type 1 diabetes. Insulin producing cells (islets) are isolated from a pancreas donated by the&#xD;
      next of kin of a person who is brain dead. After the cells are prepared, the islets are&#xD;
      transplanted into the recipient's liver and produce insulin. Patients who receive an islet&#xD;
      transplant take medication that suppresses their immune system and prevent rejection of the&#xD;
      islet tissue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators have also learned that there is general inflammation at the time of the&#xD;
      transplant that is not fully controlled with our standard medications. The investigators&#xD;
      believe this inflammation may cause some islet cell death around the time of transplant. Due&#xD;
      to this islet death around the time of transplant, most recipients need 2 or 3 separate&#xD;
      transplant procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators are studying the use of Alpha-1 Antitrypsin (AAT) in islet transplant to&#xD;
      decrease the amount of cell death caused by general inflammation. In this study, the&#xD;
      investigators hope to decrease the need for more than one transplant procedure by controlling&#xD;
      inflammation, before and after transplant, with Alpha-1 Antitrypsin (Aralast NP).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Alpha-1 Antitrypsin is a protein made in healthy humans that helps to prevent tissue damage&#xD;
      during times of inflammation. Alpha-1 Antitrypsin is obtained from healthy plasma donors.&#xD;
      There have been studies in Islet Transplant in monkeys using this medication and it has shown&#xD;
      to protect the islets from inflammation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study involves using Alpha-1 Antitrypsin in addition to our current Standard of Care&#xD;
      medications used in Islet Transplant.&#xD;

      METHODS &amp; PROCEDURES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This clinical trial will be a non-randomized, open-label, single arm, prospective trial to&#xD;
      asses the efficacy of AAT in preventing non-immunologic loss of transplanted islet mass in a&#xD;
      single-donor islet transplant. Enrolled patients (n=12) will participate in the study for 1&#xD;
      year, with outcomes assessed during islet isolation, 90 days post-transplant and at 1 year&#xD;
      post-transplant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The current Standard of Care treatment for Islet Transplant includes induction&#xD;
      (Alemtuzumab/Basiliximab) and long-term immunosuppression (Prograf/Cellcept). The engraftment&#xD;
      regimen includes anti-inflammatory medications (Etanercept/Anakinra) and intravenous insulin&#xD;
      and heparin. We will utilize the current Islet Standard of Care Protocol. The only additional&#xD;
      intervention used in this pilot trial is the addition of the investigational agent,&#xD;
      alpha-1-antitrypsin to islet processing, culture, and patient treatment pre- and&#xD;
      post-transplant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Islet Dosage and Culture&#xD;
&#xD;
      Islets will be treated with AAT (to a final dilution of 0.5mg/mL) throughout the isolation&#xD;
      and culture process. Islet treatment will include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Flushing through the superior mesenteric artery and splenic artery (final dilution&#xD;
           0.5mg/mL)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Culturing with AAT (final dilution 0.5mg/mL)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participant Dosing&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects undergoing intraportal clinical islet transplantation will receive treatment (AAT at&#xD;
      120mg/kg intravenously, based on Day -1 admission weight and rounded to the nearest 20mg) at&#xD;
      the following time points:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Day -1 prior to transplant&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Day 3 post-transplant&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Day 7 post-transplant&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Day 14 post-transplant Recipient management including the transplant procedure,&#xD;
           postoperative care, immunosuppression and other medications, and post-transplant&#xD;
           monitoring will follow standard of care protocols.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SCOPE &amp; DURATION:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment will take place at the Clinical Islet Transplant Program at the University of&#xD;
      Alberta Hospital, Edmonton, Alberta. Participants (N=12) will be adult patients, assessed and&#xD;
      deemed appropriate to activate on the waiting list for islet transplantation. Anticipated&#xD;
      duration of enrollment is 12 months, with follow-up at 90 days and 12 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this pilot study control data will be obtained from a Standard of Care control cohort as&#xD;
      comparison.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will also obtain 2 year and 3 year long-term follow-up data from standard of care testing.&#xD;
      This long-term follow up will review data collected within 3 years post-transplant and will&#xD;
      include the following: patient and graft survival data, biochemical data from routine blood&#xD;
      work, routine and for cause imaging, metabolic testing, initiation of interventions to treat&#xD;
      complications, and reporting of any adverse or serious adverse events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY FOLLOWUP:&#xD;
&#xD;
      As follow-up, this study will use a number of blood tests and parameters used by the clinical&#xD;
      program. We will obtain the following information regarding participant outcomes from routine&#xD;
      blood testing, metabolic testing, and clinic visits:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Complete blood count (CBC)-differential to monitor white and red blood cells&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Liver function tests&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Kidney function tests&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood sugar tests, including the Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) which estimates average blood&#xD;
           sugars over 3 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  C-peptide testing, a chemical produced only be healthy, working islets.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These clinics will occur weekly x 4weeks, then at 1 month, 3 months, 6, months and 12 months.&#xD;
      Participants will then have annual clinic visits, all as standard of care. Clinic visits&#xD;
      include vital signs, physician assessment, review of recorded blood glucose records, and&#xD;
      determination of patient requiring insulin or becoming insulin independent by a set of&#xD;
      criteria based on the above blood sugar testing and glucose records.&#xD;
