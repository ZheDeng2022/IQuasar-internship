  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research study is evaluating two drugs, alectinib and bevacizumab, as possible&#xD;
      treatments for Advanced Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase I/II clinical trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A Phase I clinical trial tests the safety of an investigational intervention and also&#xD;
           tries to define the appropriate dose(s) of the investigational intervention to use for&#xD;
           further studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Phase II clinical trials test the safety and effectiveness of an investigational&#xD;
           intervention to learn whether the intervention works in treating a specific disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  &quot;Investigational&quot; means that the intervention is being studied.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  In this research study, the investigators are investigating the combination of two&#xD;
                study drugs: alectinib and bevacizumab. The FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug&#xD;
                Administration) has not approved alectinib as a treatment for any disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It has been found that some people with NSCLC have a change (mutation) in a certain gene&#xD;
      called the anaplastic lymphoma receptor tyrosine kinase (ALK) gene. This mutated gene helps&#xD;
      cancer cells grow.&#xD;
&#xD;
      -- Alectinib belongs to a class of drugs designed to inhibit ALK. This drug has been used in&#xD;
      other research studies. Information from those other research studies suggests that alectinib&#xD;
      may be effective in killing cancer cells that have changes in ALK. Only participants with&#xD;
      changes in the ALK gene will be allowed to participate in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this research study, Alectinib will be combined with Bevacizumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      -- Bevacizumab (also called Avastin) works by slowing or stopping the growth of cells in&#xD;
      cancer tumors by decreasing the blood supply of the tumors. If blood supply is decreased,&#xD;
      oxygen and nutrients that are needed for tumor growth are decreased. The FDA has approved&#xD;
      Bevacizumab as a treatment option for your disease&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to test the safety of Alectinib and Bevacizumab. The&#xD;
      investigators will also determine how effective this combination is in participants with&#xD;
      advanced, ALK-positive NSCLC with a focus on participants with brain metastases.&#xD;
