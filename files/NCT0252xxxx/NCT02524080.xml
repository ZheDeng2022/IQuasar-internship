      If patients get to optimal level of healthcare directly it will prevent suffering for both&#xD;
      patients and their relatives and moreover save a lot of resources. In the project &quot;Care at&#xD;
      the right care level&quot; (CRC) the Emergency Medical Services (EMS) will triage patients who are&#xD;
      in need of primary health care to the Primary Care (PC) instead of to the Emergency&#xD;
      Department (ED). This intervention should be implemented with the same medical safety as with&#xD;
      traditional care in the ED and the patient and their relatives should experience&#xD;
      corresponding confidence to the healthcare provider. To prepare this intervention this&#xD;
      patient group and their care needs have to be identified by a retrospective journal review&#xD;
      and a guideline has to be developed. To evaluate the patients' and their relatives'&#xD;
      experience of the intervention, finally interviews will be implemented. This project is&#xD;
      expected to provide answers whether it is possible to triage non-urgent patients to another&#xD;
      care level with the same medical safety and that the patients experience the same confidence&#xD;
      in healthcare. And further it will answer the question, if the care providers around the&#xD;
      patient manage to collaborate.&#xD;

      Background&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research has a caring science approach, which has the patient in focus, with the general&#xD;
      aim to describe care that strengthens and supports health. Further, a health care science&#xD;
      approach recognizes the patient's suffering as a motivation for care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study a non-urgent patient is a patient with illness, injury or ill-health suitable&#xD;
      for the health care received in PC. The PC is able to take care of problems that not urgent&#xD;
      and unlikely to require admission. The problem should not need specialized service in an ED,&#xD;
      such as facilities, urgent intervention, rapid and/or complex diagnostic and could equally be&#xD;
      managed at the PC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For increased survival, reduced risk of complications and ability to quickly return to a&#xD;
      functional life, it is important that there is a coherent chain of care. The EMS with the&#xD;
      Prehospital Emergency Nurses (PEN:s) is an important part of many treatment chains, fast&#xD;
      tracks and pathways, for example for patients with stroke, heart attack, hip fracture and&#xD;
      geriatric care.The care model the EMS currently follows, means that virtually all patients&#xD;
      transported to ED regardless of medical need and seriousness, which is consistent with&#xD;
      current medical guidelines. Studies shows that around 25 % of patients arriving to the ED&#xD;
      should have been treated at another level of care for having the right care. There is also a&#xD;
      connection between increased mortality and overloading in the ED.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The need for emergency care is large and tends to increase, particularly in the elderly&#xD;
      population (≥ 65 years). For resources to be utilized effectively, the health care has to be&#xD;
      given at the level of care that is most appropriate. This requires that different providers&#xD;
      that all have a responsibility for the patients can think outside the box, based on the&#xD;
      individual patient's need of care. In addition, assumes cooperation and coordination to&#xD;
      enable organizational change, which can provide good care from the patient's perspective.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The numbers of care seekers tend to rise and health care resources must be used more&#xD;
      efficiently to cope with the increasing patients. Today the healthcare providers, the Country&#xD;
      Council, the PC and Community Care, don't collaborate with each other, although they all have&#xD;
      a shared responsibility. According to health care prioritization decisions, witch control the&#xD;
      need of care and time to care. For resources to be utilized efficiently, care is provided at&#xD;
      the care level that is most appropriate. However this cannot be achieved today, because of&#xD;
      the regional guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The problem exists nationally and studies show that it is also an internationally problem,&#xD;
      and as the number of care seekers increases, the problem tends to grow. Studies explain that&#xD;
      a lot of patients could go to the PC. And some means that one third of the patients should&#xD;
      have their care at another level than ED.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A new model with extended prehospital emergency care, which not has been tried before, means&#xD;
      that assessment of the patient's condition and the need for continuing care is made at&#xD;
      collection point, if the patient's medical condition make this possible. The health care&#xD;
      model called &quot;Care at the right care level&quot; (CRC), means that the assessment and treatment&#xD;
      interventions are implemented, and decisions on further treatment is planned in consultation&#xD;
      with the general physician (GP) in the patient's PC. Decisions on continuing care can, for&#xD;
      example, implicate that the patient receives a visit time to the GP immediately or later, or&#xD;
      run directly to the ED.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aims The overall aim is to investigate if it is possible for the Prehospital Emergency Nurse&#xD;
      (PEN) to triage non-urgent patients to optimal care level in the the Primary Care (PC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Issues:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  How do patients experience trust to the healthcare?&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Is the new care model medical safe?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study 1&#xD;
&#xD;
      Title: Swedish emergency medical services' identification of potential candidates for primary&#xD;
      healthcare. Resubmitted June 2015, Scandinavian Journal of Primary Health Care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim is to investigate if it is possible to isolate and identify the patient group and&#xD;
      their care needs, which can be triaged at the primary care instead of to the ED.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study 2&#xD;
&#xD;
      Title: Patients with suspected primary healthcare problems using the emergency medical&#xD;
      services - Developing a questionnaire to measure patient trust in healthcare. In manuscript.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim is to developing an instrument for measuring patient's confidence to the health care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study 3&#xD;
&#xD;
      Title: Care at the right care level - an intervention study. Ongoing from April 2013.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the study is to investigate if it is possible to triage less sick or injured&#xD;
      patients to another level of care with the same medical safety and that they still have the&#xD;
      same confidence to the healthcare.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study 4&#xD;
&#xD;
      Title: Prehospital emergency care for patients with primary care needs - Patients'&#xD;
      experiences&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the study is to describe the patient's lived experiences of being treated in the&#xD;
      new caring model.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethical considerations&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the interventions study (study 3), there will be a risk that the patient need a secondary&#xD;
      transport from the Healthcare Center to the ED. To reduce that risk the PEN always take a&#xD;
      contact with the physician at the Primary care clinic, when the patient in the CRC-project is&#xD;
      randomized to The Primary care. It is also always a risk that the patient feels depended and&#xD;
      feels duty to participate in the study. So it is important that the PEN provides correct&#xD;
      information about the free will. Except the above mentioned ethical considerations no other&#xD;
      are aspected to arise. The benefit is considered high, while the risk is considered small.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis&#xD;
&#xD;
      With the CRC-model the patients receive optimal health care and feel the same trust to the&#xD;
      healthcare as the traditional healthcare.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary and secondary endpoints.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary endpoint is the proportion who received optimal care and experiencing the same&#xD;
      trust in the care than to the traditional care.Secondary endpoints are correct preliminary&#xD;
      assessment/final diagnosis without secondary transport.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The relation between the studies is logical. To do an intervention study, it is necessary to&#xD;
      know witch patient´s is possible to include. And the PEN needs a decision support for their&#xD;
      help to triage right patient to right level of care (study 1). For evaluating if patients&#xD;
      still feel the same confidence to the healthcare, a measuring instrument is needed, and it&#xD;
      also has to be validated (study 2). To know if it is possible to triage the non-urgent&#xD;
      patient group to the Healthcare Center, the investigators have to try the intervention, and&#xD;
      evaluate the project (study 3). To get a deeper understanding for the patients and his&#xD;
      relatives experiences of obtaining the new healthcare model, interviews will be done (study&#xD;
      4).&#xD;
