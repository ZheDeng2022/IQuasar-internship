      The purpose of this study is determine whether the combination therapy with LEE011 and&#xD;
      chemoembolization in patients with locally advanced Hepatocellular Carcinoma not amenable to&#xD;
      curative therapies will provide greater efficacy than chemoembolization alone with a&#xD;
      tolerable safety profile.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Single-arm, single-institution, non-randomized, open-label phase II study to determine the&#xD;
      efficacy and safety of treatment with LEE011 and chemoembolization in patients with advanced&#xD;
      HCC (Hepatocellular Carcinoma) not amenable to curative therapies. A total of 40 patients&#xD;
      will be enrolled and undergo chemoembolization. Patients will receive LEE011 (600 mg PO once&#xD;
      daily, 3 weeks on/1 week off) on Day 1 with chemoembolization. Patients can receive a total&#xD;
      of 4 chemoembolization treatments within 6 month following first treatment as needed to treat&#xD;
      initial HCC (Hepatocellular Carcinoma) lesion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Progression free survival will be based on tumor assessment using RECIST 1.1 criteria&#xD;
      (Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors) Patients will receive trial treatment until&#xD;
      disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, death or discontinuation from the study treatment&#xD;
      for any other reason. Patients will be followed for survival regardless of treatment&#xD;
      discontinuation for any reason.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will include men and women with locally advanced HCC (Hepatocellular Carcinoma) not&#xD;
      amenable to curative therapy who have received no prior therapy for advanced disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigational Therapy:&#xD;
&#xD;
      LEE011 oral (3 weeks on/1 week off) in combination with chemoembolization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Efficacy Assessments:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Dynamic contrasted abdominal computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging will be&#xD;
           done at baseline, every 8 weeks, and every 3 months thereafter following initial&#xD;
           chemoembolization.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Chest CT imaging as clinically indicated&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Survival status every 12 months (or earlier if required) regardless of treatment&#xD;
           discontinuation reason&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary endpoint of the trial will be progression free survival (PFS) of HCC patients.&#xD;
      PFS is defined to be the time from initiation of treatment to progression or death without&#xD;
      evidence of progression. For cases without documentation of progression, follow-up will be&#xD;
      censored at the date of last disease assessment without progression, unless death occurs&#xD;
      within 4 months following the date of last progression-free, in which case death will be&#xD;
      counted as an event. The historical median PFS for TACE (Transcatheter arterial&#xD;
      chemoembolization) alone is 8-10 months. This study will target a hazard ratio of 0.69 with&#xD;
      an 80% power and a one-sided significance level of 10%. Assuming a 24-month accrual and an&#xD;
      18-month follow-up period the study requires 38 patients initiating LEE011 treatment with the&#xD;
      median PFS for TACE alone is 8 months, and 41 patients with the median PFS for&#xD;
      TACE(Transcatheter arterial chemoembolization) alone is 10 months. PFS will be estimated&#xD;
      using the Kaplan-Meier method, and Greenwood's formula will be used to calculate the standard&#xD;
      error of the corresponding Kaplan-Meier estimate and 95% confidence interval. Survival curves&#xD;
      will be estimated using Kaplan-Meier methodology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary endpoints of efficacy are to evaluate OS (Overall Survival). The statistical&#xD;
      methods used for the analysis of PFS will be used for the analysis of OS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Other secondary objectives will include description of toxicity of the therapy regimen. These&#xD;
      data will be analyzed separately. The safety analyses will be performed on all patients who&#xD;
      receive any dose of therapy. Adverse events will be described using the NCI CTCAE v 4.03&#xD;
      criteria (ctep.cancer.gov/forms.CTCAEv4.pdf). Frequency and severity of adverse events&#xD;
      according to the NCI CTCAE ) v 4.03 (Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events) body&#xD;
      system and severity criteria will be described. In addition, frequency of Grade 3 or 4&#xD;
      adverse events will be described separately. Causality will also be noted. Adverse events&#xD;
      will be recorded for up to 1 year following discontinuation from study. Response rate and&#xD;
      toxicity rate will be estimated using an exact binomial method along with the 95% confidence&#xD;
      interval&#xD;

             or implanted hormonal methods of contraception or other forms of hormonal&#xD;
             contraception that have comparable efficacy (failure rate &lt;1%), for example hormone&#xD;
             vaginal ring or transdermal hormone contraception; 45 B-Placement of an intrauterine&#xD;
             device (IUD) or intrauterine system (IUS); 45 C-Barrier methods of contraception:&#xD;
             Condom or Occlusive cap (diaphragm or cervical/vault caps) with spermicidal&#xD;
             foam/gel/film/cream/ vaginal suppository in case of use of oral contraception, women&#xD;
             should have been stable on the same pill before taking study treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Note: Oral contraceptives are allowed but should be used in conjunction with a barrier&#xD;
        method of contraception due to unknown effect of drug-drug interaction. Women are&#xD;
        considered post-menopausal and not of child bearing potential if they have had 12 months of&#xD;
        natural (spontaneous) amenorrhea with an appropriate clinical profile (e.g. age&#xD;
        appropriate, history of vasomotor symptoms) or have had surgical bilateral oophorectomy&#xD;
        (with or without hysterectomy) or tubal ligation at least six weeks ago. In the case of&#xD;
        oophorectomy alone, only when the reproductive status of the woman has been confirmed by&#xD;
        follow up hormone level assessment is she considered not of child bearing potential.&#xD;
&#xD;
        46-Sexually active males, unless they use a condom during intercourse while taking the&#xD;
        drug, and for 21 days after stopping treatment of LEE011 -- should not father a child in&#xD;
        this period. A condom is required to be used also by vasectomized male in order to prevent&#xD;
        delivery of the drug via seminal fluid.&#xD;

            <description>A total of 40 patients will be enrolled and undergo chemoembolization. Patients will receive LEE011 (600 mg PO once daily, 3 weeks on/1 week off) on Day 1 with chemoembolization.

LEE011: 600 mg PO once daily will be given orally on days 1-21 of a 28 day cycle (3 weeks on / 1 week off) :until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, death, or discontinuation from the study treatment due to any other reason&#xD;
Chemoembolization: Patients will be treated with chemoembolization once every 4 weeks with up to 4 total chemoembolizations within the first 6 months from the initial chemoembolization.</description>
