    <textblock>
      This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of anti-inducible T-cell&#xD;
      co-stimulator (ICOS) monoclonal antibody MEDI-570 in treating patients with peripheral T-cell&#xD;
      lymphoma follicular variant or angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma that has returned after a&#xD;
      period of improvement (relapsed) or has not responded to previous treatment (refractory).&#xD;
      Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as anti-ICOS monoclonal antibody MEDI-570, may&#xD;
      induce changes in the body's immune system and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells&#xD;
      to grow and spread.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the safety, maximum tolerated dose and recommended phase II dose (RP2D) of&#xD;
      anti-ICOS monoclonal antibody MEDI-570 (MEDI-570) in patients with refractory/relapsed&#xD;
      peripheral T-cell lymphoma-not otherwise specified (PTCL-NOS), angioimmunoblastic T-cell&#xD;
      lymphoma (AITL), follicular lymphoma, mycosis fungoides (MF) and cutaneous T-cell lymphomas&#xD;
      (CTCL).&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate the pharmacokinetic profile of MEDI-570. II. To evaluate the overall response&#xD;
      rate (ORR) and progression free survival (PFS) of MEDI-570 at all dose levels and in a&#xD;
      10-patient expansion cohort at the maximum tolerated dose (MTD).&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To determine short and long term effects of MEDI-570 at all dose levels on the immune&#xD;
      system and on T-cell lymphocyte subsets.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To determine the relationship between ICOS expression on tumor cells and response to&#xD;
      MEDI-570.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate biomarkers of response and resistance to MEDI-570 in the study population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive anti-ICOS monoclonal antibody MEDI-570 intravenously (IV) over 1-4 hours on&#xD;
      day 1. Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 8 cycles in the absence of disease&#xD;
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days and then every 6&#xD;
      weeks for 12 weeks.&#xD;

             initiation is mandatory; for patients who have undergone a fresh baseline biopsy at&#xD;
             baseline, the archived tissue is not mandatory&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The effects of MEDI-570 on the developing human fetus are unknown; for this reason,&#xD;
             women of child-bearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception&#xD;
             (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry, during&#xD;
             the study participation, and for 3 months after the last dose of the drug; should a&#xD;
             woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while she or her partner is&#xD;
             participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician immediately; men&#xD;
             treated or enrolled on this protocol must have either had a prior vasectomy or agree&#xD;
             to use effective contraception prior to the study, during the study, and for 3 months&#xD;

             at least three months after therapy is completed&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who are receiving any other investigational agents&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with known brain metastases should be excluded from this clinical trial&#xD;
             because of their poor prognosis and because they often develop progressive neurologic&#xD;
             dysfunction that would confound the evaluation of neurologic and other adverse events&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic&#xD;
             composition to MEDI-570 or history of anaphylaxis to any biological component&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any history or evidence of opportunistic infection within 6 months of screening&#xD;
             including tuberculosis, severe cytomegalovirus (CMV) or herpetic infections (such as&#xD;
             disseminated herpes, herpes encephalitis, ophthalmic herpes)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Evidence of active infection by hepatitis B and/or C; active viral infection by&#xD;
             hepatitis B and hepatitis C could be associated with cytopenias (due to hypersplenism&#xD;
             or due to the active virus itself), which could add further risk when a potential&#xD;
             immunosuppressive medication is used; for patients with hepatitis B treated with&#xD;
             anti-virals to undetectable viral load, and for patients with hepatitis C with&#xD;
             undetectable ribonucleic acid (RNA) levels and no evidence of liver damage, enrollment&#xD;
             may be considered and should discuss first with study's principal investigator&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection; the human immunodeficiency&#xD;
             virus (HIV) depletes CD4 T-cells and could also have a role in T-cell anergy; since&#xD;
             MEDI-570 preferentially affects CD4 T-cell numbers and function, and the resultant&#xD;
             immunosuppression by this agent can be prolonged, exposing HIV patients to MEDI-570&#xD;
             will place them in an unnecessary risk of developing infections due to an underlying&#xD;
             acquired cellular immunity defect&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of primary immunodeficiency&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Receipt of live or live attenuated vaccine within 12 weeks prior to enrollment&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  All potential patients must undergo a tuberculosis (TB) test prior to study entry to&#xD;
             rule out active or latent tuberculosis (either purified protein derivative [PPD] or&#xD;
             QuantiFERON-TB Gold, whichever is preferred and available at the institution);&#xD;
             patients with a history of TB (even if treated), or evidence of active or latent TB,&#xD;
             are excluded; the diagnosis of active TB is defined per current guidelines; patients&#xD;
             with a positive TB test (e.g. PPD or QuantiFERON-TB Gold) will be excluded; patients&#xD;
             with history of Bacille-Calmette-Guerin (BCG) vaccination will be tested with&#xD;
             QuantiFERON-TB Gold test in order to rule out exposure to TB&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have undergone allogeneic stem cell transplantation&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have undergone autologous stem cell transplantation within 3 months from&#xD;
             study entry&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Major surgery within 30 days prior or during the study period&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active&#xD;
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac&#xD;
             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with&#xD;
             study requirements&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study due to the potential toxicity in&#xD;
             pre-clinical reproductive studies; in addition, there is an unknown but potential risk&#xD;
             for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with&#xD;
             MEDI-570; breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated with MEDI-570&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with active, known, or suspected autoimmune disease, except in these&#xD;
             conditions:&#xD;

&#xD;
                    -  Residual hypothyroidism due to autoimmune condition only requiring hormone&#xD;
                       replacement&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  Euthyroid participants with a history of Grave's disease (participants&#xD;
                       suspected autoimmune thyroid disorders must be negative for thyroglobulin&#xD;
                       and thyroid peroxidase antibodies and thyroid stimulating immunoglobulin&#xD;
                       prior to first dose of study drug)&#xD;
