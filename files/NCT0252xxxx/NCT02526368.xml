    <textblock>
      This pilot clinical trial studies how well magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging (MRSI)&#xD;
      with hyperpolarized carbon C13 pyruvate works in finding prostate cancer that exhibits poorly&#xD;
      differentiated or undifferentiated cells (high-grade) and that is restricted to the site of&#xD;
      origin, without evidence of spread (localized) in patients undergoing radical prostatectomy.&#xD;
      Diagnostic procedures, such as MRSI with hyperpolarized carbon C13 pyruvate, may aid in the&#xD;
      diagnosis of prostate cancer and in discriminating high-grade from low-grade prostate cancer&#xD;
      and benign adjacent prostate tissue&#xD;
    </textblock>

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To investigate the association between hyperpolarized (HP) pyruvate-to-lactate conversion&#xD;
      (kPL) and HP urea perfusion with histologic grade of prostate cancer, including benign&#xD;
      prostate tissue, low grade disease (primary Gleason score &lt; 4), and high grade (primary&#xD;
      Gleason score &gt;= 4) prostate cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Safety. II. To determine the optimal cut-off value of peak lactate to pyruvate ratio&#xD;
      (lac/pyr), lac/pyr area under the curve (AUC), 13C pyruvate to lactate (kPL) rate, urea AUC,&#xD;
      and urea transfer constant (ktrans) on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) that accurately&#xD;
      detects primary Gleason 4 component cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To determine the reproducibility of peak lac/pyr, lac/pyr AUC and kPL, urea AUC and urea&#xD;
      ktrans with same-day repeated dose studies. with same-day repeated dose studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To compare peak lac/pyr, lac/pyr AUC and kPL, urea AUC, urea ktrans on MRI with Prostate&#xD;
      Imaging-Reporting and Data System (PI-RADS) assessment of multiparametic MRI in predicting&#xD;
      regions of cancer versus benign tissue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To correlate histologic markers, including lactate dehydrogenase A (LDHA) expression and&#xD;
      activity level, along with Ki-67, MYC, and MCT 1 and 4 expression, with peak intra-tumoral&#xD;
      lac/pyr ratio, lactate AUC, and kPL detected using anatomically aligned magnetic resonance&#xD;
      (MR) cross-sectional images of the prostate gland.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To test for an association between mean intra-tumoral lac/pyr signal and lactate AUC,&#xD;
      kPL, urea AUC, and urea ktrans with adverse clinical and pathologic characteristics including&#xD;
      extracapsular extension, positive nodal involvement, and failure to achieve undetectable&#xD;
      prostate specific antigen (PSA) nadir following prostatectomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive hyperpolarized carbon C 13 pyruvate and urea C-13 intravenously (IV) and&#xD;
      undergo MRSI within 12 weeks before undergoing radical prostatectomy. Patients may receive&#xD;
      optional second hyperpolarized carbon C 13 pyruvate injection and undergo MRSI within 15-60&#xD;
      minutes after first scan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study, patients are followed up at 24 hours.&#xD;
