  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Depression affects 350 million people worldwide. In the light of the global disease burden&#xD;
      statistics, the efficacy of current treatments for depression appears insufficient. Thus,&#xD;
      research on novel treatment interventions and predictors for good treatment response are&#xD;
      warranted. Earlier prospective follow-up studies and intervention studies suggest that&#xD;
      several bio-psychosocial factors, including high serum concentrations of vitamin D, are&#xD;
      related to better treatment outcomes. In this follow-up study with randomized clinical&#xD;
      vitamin D supplementation trial on patients with depression, the investigators aim to&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. clarify how a six-month intervention with vitamin D supplementation affects treatment&#xD;
           response, recovery, and the biological pathways related to depression. This aims to&#xD;
           finding potential sub-groups getting benefits from vitamin D supplementation. In&#xD;
           addition, the investigators want to&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. investigate and characterize factors related to recovery from depression and working&#xD;
           ability in depression patients in the long-term. The investigators are especially&#xD;
           interested in the bio-psychosocial factors and the aims include examining both the&#xD;
           individual's positive resources.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The trial will start with a six-month double-blinded randomized controlled trial with vitamin&#xD;
      D supplementation. The aim is to recruit altogether 3028 patients with non-psychotic,&#xD;
      unipolar depression, aged 18-65 years, who are referred to the recruitment sites for&#xD;
      treatment for depression. The participants will be randomized to low (10 µg/day) or high (100&#xD;
      µg/day) vitamin D supplementation group. Clinically necessary antidepressant treatments will&#xD;
      continue during the intervention as needed. After six months of intervention, the&#xD;
      participants will be followed up at 18 months and at 5 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several measurements will be conducted during the intervention and follow-up period.&#xD;
      Participants will fill a variety of clinical questionnaires and questionnaires with&#xD;
      background information. All participants give blood samples for biomarker analyses at time&#xD;
      points 3, 6, 18 months and 5 years. Clinical interviews of mental disorders (e.g. SCID) and&#xD;
      anthropometric measurements (e.g. weight, height, blood pressure) will be carried out.&#xD;
