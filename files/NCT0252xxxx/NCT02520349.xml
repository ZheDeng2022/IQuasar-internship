  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposed research is a longitudinal human lab study to examine how measures of abuse&#xD;
      liability and product appeal vary by e-cigarette device type, and how these lab assessments&#xD;
      may predict subsequent e-cigarette and other tobacco use behavior at 1,3, and 6 months. An&#xD;
      additional aim is to evaluate e-cigarette safety and tolerability among smokers by device&#xD;
      type.&#xD;

      The proposed research is a longitudinal human lab study to involving 6 lab visits and 3&#xD;
      follow-up surveys at 1, 3, and 6 months after participants' last lab visit. Investigators&#xD;
      will enroll 30 smokers (≥10 cig/day) who have not used e-cigarettes in the past 30 days and&#xD;
      have never used e-cigarettes &quot;fairly regularly.&quot; After a telephone screening to confirm&#xD;
      eligibility, participants will attend Virginia Commonwealth University's (VCU) Clinical&#xD;
      Behavioral Pharmacology Laboratory for all lab visits. The specific aims are to:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1. Examine how measures of abuse liability and product appeal vary by ECIG device type&#xD;
      (Markten vs. e-Go).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2. Compare differences in abuse liability and product appeal between participants' usual&#xD;
      brand of tobacco cigarette, Markten, and e-Go.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 3. As an exploratory aim, examine the extent to which measures of abuse liability and&#xD;
      product appeal as measured in the lab (including TPPT) predict participants' real-world ECIG&#xD;
      use at the 1-, 3-, and 6-month follow-up surveys.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 4. To monitor safety and tolerability the MarkTen and e-Go among smokers.&#xD;

      Plasma nicotine: Investigators will examine change in plasma nicotine concentration before&#xD;
      and after 5 minutes of directed product use (10 total puffs). At the start of the session, a&#xD;
      phlebotomist will draw 7mL of blood via venipuncture (no catheter). Participants will then be&#xD;
      directed to take a puff of their own brand/assigned e-cigarette device every 30 seconds for 5&#xD;
      minutes. At the end of the directed use session, the phlebotomist will draw another 7mL of&#xD;
      blood via venipuncture. Blood samples will be processed at the Center for Study of Tobacco&#xD;
      Products lab, frozen, and walked across the street to the Bioanalytical Mass Spectrometry&#xD;
      Core Laboratory at VCU for cotinine/3-OH analysis using previously developed assays. Blood&#xD;
      samples will not be retained for additional analyses.&#xD;

        A total of 30 community volunteers who currently use 10 or more cigarettes per day and have&#xD;
        no immediate plans to quit smoking will be enrolled. Investigators will attempt to recruit&#xD;
        an equal number of men and women of diverse racial/ethnic backgrounds. This preliminary&#xD;
        study is not intended to address gender or race/ethnic differences.&#xD;
