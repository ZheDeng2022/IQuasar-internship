      The purpose of the study is to evaluate the effect of resistive exercise on forearm blood&#xD;
      flow and tissue oxygenation among breast cancer survivors with or at risk for breast&#xD;
      cancer-related lymphoedema (BCRL).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      160 subjects who have a diagnosis of breast cancer , 80 with and 80 without BCRL, will be&#xD;
      recruited. Eligible subjects are Chinese ethnicity female breast cancer survivors, aged&#xD;
      younger than 70 years old and body mass index less than 30kg/m2, remained disease free with a&#xD;
      clinical diagnosis of stable BCRL and without BCRL. Subjects will be excluded if they have&#xD;
      bilateral or unstable BCRL, defined as significant changes to the arm or receiving intensive&#xD;
      therapy (i.e. decongestive therapy or antibiotics for infection) within the past 3 months, or&#xD;
      musculoskeletal, cardiovascular and/ or neurological disorders that could inhibit them from&#xD;
      exercising.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary outcomes include brachial artery blood flow measured by a Doppler ultrasound device&#xD;
      and tissue oxygenation measured by near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS). Additional outcomes and&#xD;
      measures include arm circumference measurement, bioelectrical impedance spectroscopy,&#xD;
      self-reported lymphoedema symptoms survey, handgrip dynamometer strength testing, upper limb&#xD;
      range of motion measurements and quality of life measures using Functional Assessment of&#xD;
      Cancer Therapy-Breast Cancer subscale (FACT-B) questionnaire will be obtained.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All outcomes measures will be assessed on both affected and contralateral unaffected arms of&#xD;
      all subjects at pre-exercise, immediately post-exercise and 3-month after exercise.&#xD;
      Comparison of the baseline measurements between breast cancer survivors with and without BCRL&#xD;
      will be obtained.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be randomly assigned by computer programme to exercise group and control group.&#xD;
      Randomization will be stratified by whether axillary dissection and/ or axilla radiotherapy&#xD;
      was given or not. The exercise group will receive supervised resistive exercise programme.&#xD;
      Subjects in the exercise group will attend small group-based exercise sessions twice a week&#xD;
      for 8 weeks supervised by physiotherapists. The duration of each exercise session will last&#xD;
      for approximately 1 hour. Prior to resistive exercises, the subjects will perform warm up&#xD;
      with movements of large joints and shoulder girdle for 15 minutes. Resistive exercises will&#xD;
      focus on the major muscle groups in the upper body. Loading of resistive exercises will be&#xD;
      prescribed and progressed according to individual capacity reaching a level of moderate to&#xD;
      high loading (6 -12 repetition maximum). The subjects will also be instructed to perform&#xD;
      stretching exercises specific to the muscle groups trained after the session. Symptoms&#xD;
      responses will be monitored using self-reported lymphoedema symptoms survey before and after&#xD;
      each exercise session. Rate of perceived exertion will also be recorded immediately after&#xD;
      each exercise session.&#xD;
