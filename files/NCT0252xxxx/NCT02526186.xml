  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We will conduct a randomized controlled trial to determine whether the addition of&#xD;
      battlefield auricular acupuncture to standard of care is effective for control of postpartum&#xD;
      pain for mothers in the immediate post-partum period. Post-partum patients (DoD&#xD;
      beneficiaries) 18 years or older, regardless of gravida/parity, who plan to have a childbirth&#xD;
      in a hospital setting will be offered the opportunity to participate in the study through PCM&#xD;
      referrals and posted advertisements. After a minimum of 6 hours post-vaginal delivery or 24&#xD;
      hours post caesarean section subjects will be given treatment according to their&#xD;
      randomization group. Subjects will be assessed on pain control, overall satisfaction with&#xD;
      pain management, and the amount of pharmacological pain medications used. Safety of measures&#xD;
      will also be assessed to include infection rates, syncope, vertigo, and hypotension.&#xD;

      Screening Visit:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Obtain signed Informed Consent document and HIPAA Authorization.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Review past medical history in Armed Forces Health Longitudinal Technology Application&#xD;
           (AHLTA) to verify the inclusion/exclusion criteria and including previous encounter,&#xD;
           vital signs review, medication list, co-morbidities, demographics, problems list, prior&#xD;
           obstetric history, and note any prior acupuncture received.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Record: Date of birth, age, gender, race, ethnicity, last 4 of social security number,&#xD;
           current email address.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization: Subjects will then be randomized into one of two groups by one of the Research&#xD;
      Coordinators using a random number generator:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group 1: Standard of care only.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group 2: Standard of care plus Battlefield acupuncture at treatment sites Cingulate&#xD;
           gyrus, thalamus, omega 2, shen-men, point zero in both ears (see figures 1-5). The 5&#xD;
           needles will remain in each ear for up to 7 days or allowed to fall out on their own&#xD;
           (the patient will be instructed not to remove the needles).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Subject's ears will be cleansed with an alcohol swab&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Subjects will be given a handout of standard BFA Discharge Instructions including what&#xD;
           an infection looks like and what to do in the event of an infection (see attached).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 1: Will occur after a minimum of 6 hours post vaginal birth (up until hospital&#xD;
      discharge) to avoid disturbing maternal infant bonding or a minimum of 24 hours post&#xD;
      caesarean section to avoid confounding with the anesthesia:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Subject will be given treatment according to their randomization group.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  All subjects, regardless of randomization group, will be instructed to have no heavy&#xD;
           meals, no excessive hot or cold foods, no heavy exercise or intercourse, and no alcohol&#xD;
           for 6 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Satisfaction with post-partum pain management will be assessed with the following&#xD;
           questions:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  On a scale of 0 to 10, how satisfied were you with your pain management after delivery?&#xD;
           (dissatisfied 0 - 10 very satisfied)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Would you use auricular acupuncture for future pain management? (Yes or no) (for those&#xD;
           in the acupuncture group only)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  On a scale of 0-10, with 10 being the worst pain, what is your level of pain?&#xD;
&#xD;
      In hospital data collection: Data will be collected each day until the patient has been&#xD;
      discharged from the hospital. Subjects will be contacted either in person or via phone and&#xD;
      the hospital stay will vary from patient to patient:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  We will review the subject's medical record and record RN Recorded Pain assessments,&#xD;
           Delivery method (either Caesarean section or spontaneous vaginal delivery), Delivery&#xD;
           complications (vaginal lacerations, use of episiotomy, operative vaginal delivery,&#xD;
           shoulder dystocia, post-partum hemorrhage), Birth weight, Maternal Parity, and record&#xD;
           what pain medications they are taking.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  We will ask subjects if they prefer to be contacted in-person or via telephone while in&#xD;
           the hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Satisfaction with post-partum pain management will be assessed with the following&#xD;
           questions:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  On a scale of 0 to 10, how satisfied were you with your pain management after delivery?&#xD;
           (dissatisfied 0 - 10 very satisfied)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Would you use auricular acupuncture for future pain management? (Yes or no) (for those&#xD;
           in the acupuncture group only)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  On a scale of 0-10, with 10 being the worst pain, what is your level of pain?&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Are the needles still in place? If yes, how many in each ear?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post hospital discharge: Each day up until 10 days post Visit 1. Subjects will be contacted&#xD;
      phone and the following information will be collected:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Satisfaction with post-partum pain management will be assessed with the following&#xD;
           questions:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  On a scale of 0 to 10, how satisfied were you with your pain management after delivery?&#xD;
           (dissatisfied 0-10 very satisfied)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Would you use auricular acupuncture for future pain management? (Yes or no) (for those&#xD;
           in the acupuncture group only)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  On a scale of 0-10, with 10 being the worst pain, what is your level of pain? â€¢ We will&#xD;
           record what pain medications they are taking including drug name, strength, and total&#xD;
           doses since discharge from the hospital.&#xD;
