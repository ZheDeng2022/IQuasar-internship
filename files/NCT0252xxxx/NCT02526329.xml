      This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of donor regulatory T cells in&#xD;
      treating patients with graft-versus-host disease affecting the liver or gastrointestinal&#xD;
      organs (visceral) within 100 days (acute) after undergoing a stem cell transplant.&#xD;
      Graft-versus-host disease occurs when donor immune cells infused in a stem cell transplant&#xD;
      attack the gut, skin, liver, or other organ systems of the patient. Regulatory T cells are a&#xD;
      type of immune cell that may be able to reduce the attack of the donor's immune cells on the&#xD;
      patient's normal cells and help treat graft-vs-host disease.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Determine the safety and feasibility of donor T regulatory (Treg) cell infusions in&#xD;
      subjects with visceral acute graft-versus-host disease (aGVHD) and incidence of dose limiting&#xD;
      toxicities (DLTs) graded according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events&#xD;
      (CTCAE version 4 [v.4]) with a focus on infusion reactions within 24 hours, respiratory&#xD;
      distress within 72 hours of infusion and all-cause mortality within 28 days of infusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Determine the quantitative blood Treg cell changes following the cell infusions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Assess dosing requirements and treatment response rates to primary steroid, secondary and&#xD;
      tertiary immunosuppressive therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. Post-transplant day +100 and day +180 survival. IV. Post-transplant incidence of chronic&#xD;
      graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) at day +180.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive donor regulatory T lymphocytes intravenously (IV) over 5 minutes or less on&#xD;
      day 0. Some patients receive a second infusion of frozen donor regulatory T lymphocytes 5-7&#xD;
      days after the initial infusion or 2 additional infusions separated by 5-7 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up weekly until day 28 and then on&#xD;
      days 100 and 180.&#xD;

    <description>Dose-limiting toxicity will be defined as CTCAE Grade 3 or higher cytokine/release syndrome/acute infusion reaction within 24 hours after Treg cell infusion.

    <description>The change in Treg cell counts from baseline to post infusion will be depicted in boxplots of both relative proportion and absolute numbers. Mean log (fold change) and confidence intervals will be calculated. The confidence intervals will be used to test the hypotheses of no change from baseline to post infusion.</description>
