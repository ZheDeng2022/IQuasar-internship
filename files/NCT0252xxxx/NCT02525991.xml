      OVERALL STUDY DESIGN:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a phase IV, multinational, multicentre, open-label, non-randomized, clinical trial&#xD;
      conducted in Europe (Spain, Germany, Finland, Norway, Romania and Austria) to evaluate the&#xD;
      safety profile of ADASUVE® in agitated patients with schizophrenia or bipolar disorder when&#xD;
      self-administered outside of a hospital setting without the supervision of a healthcare&#xD;
      professional.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Study will aim to include approximately 500 patients who have been previously treated&#xD;
      with ADASUVE® in the last 6 months prior to screening or recently treated during the planned&#xD;
      recruitment period of 6 months with a 'positive outcome' ('ADASUVE® responder') according to&#xD;
      Clinical Global Impressions (CGI-I) scale, from a total of about 30-34 centers. An 'ADASUVE®&#xD;
      responder' is defined as having a CGI-I score at 2 hours after administration of either a 1&#xD;
      (very much improved) or 2 (much improved). All patients will be followed up for a maximum of&#xD;
      6 months from baseline, during which it is expected that a new episode of agitation will&#xD;
      occur.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Centers will be selected and qualified primarily based on their estimated number of eligible&#xD;
      patients. The patients attending a hospital setting, such as Hospital Wards, Emergency Rooms,&#xD;
      Day Care Units, Hospital Home-care units, or other Institutions for an agitation episode&#xD;
      treatment will be recruited.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Site study staff will screen patients for potential participation on the clinical study at&#xD;
      the time of presentation in a hospital setting for an on-going agitation episode during the&#xD;
      recruitment period of 6 months, or retrospectively for a previous one episode within the 6&#xD;
      months prior to screening. The study staff will review the patient's medical records in&#xD;
      detail to determine eligibility.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There will be a baseline hospital visit within 2 to 4 weeks after the screening for all&#xD;
      pre-selected patients. This hospital visit will be scheduled after the resolution of the&#xD;
      episode in patients pre-selected during an on-going agitation episode. Patients with a&#xD;
      previous agitation episode will be called by phone by site staff for ensuring that they meet&#xD;
      the eligibility requirements for enrolling and planning a baseline visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At screening patients and family (or caregivers) will be informed by the study staff that at&#xD;
      the baseline visit they will receive a specific training session for the proper&#xD;
      self-administration of ADASUVE® outside the hospital setting and about other procedures&#xD;
      related to the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the baseline visit, selected patients will be asked to provide the signed informed consent&#xD;
      for inclusion in the study before any study related procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once the informed consent has been obtained the eligibility criteria will be confirmed&#xD;
      (including a negative result of the urine pregnancy test performed in women of childbearing&#xD;
      potential and that the family member or other caregiver support is in place) for the patient&#xD;
      inclusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once the patient is included in the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  He/she will receive one unit of ADASUVE® for treating the next agitation episode outside&#xD;
           the hospital setting (plus a short-acting beta-agonist bronchodilator for treatment of&#xD;
           possible severe respiratory side effects [i.e bronchospasm]).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients with the presence of a family member or other caregiver will receive a specific&#xD;
           training session for properly self-administration of ADASUVE® outside the hospital&#xD;
           setting and clear indications to identify the appearance of an agitation crisis, based&#xD;
           on the recognition of their escalating symptoms experienced in previous agitation&#xD;
           episodes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Additional educational material will be provided to the patients in a document&#xD;
           including:&#xD;
&#xD;
           o Patient information card for recognition of symptoms of agitation, instructions of the&#xD;
           study, information for recognition of respiratory symptoms and instruction of use of the&#xD;
           medicine to treat them.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The patient's diary card will be also delivered to the patient (and family&#xD;
           member/caregiver).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patient will be trained to use the patient' diary card to register the agitation episode&#xD;
           information.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each patient included in the study will receive a study kit containing: one unit ADASUVE® for&#xD;
      the next agitation episode (plus a short-acting beta-agonist bronchodilator as rescue&#xD;
      medication to treat severe respiratory symptoms), the instructions for the use of ADASUVE®,&#xD;
      ADASUVE® storage instructions, the patient's diary card and the educational material. The&#xD;
      patient's kit will also include useful instructions of ADASUVE® storage such as to store&#xD;
      locked in a cool, dry place away from direct sunlight, to keep it out of reach of children,&#xD;
      not to use it after the expiry date which is stated on the product label, not to discard it&#xD;
      in the household waste and to keep it in pouch until time of use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At baseline the following data will be obtained retrospectively from medical records for each&#xD;
      patient and will be recorded in the electronic case report forms: demographics, diagnosis,&#xD;
      agitation information of current/previous episode (date/time of the onset, time to&#xD;
      improvement and patient status rate at 2h of ADASUVE® administration [CGI-I scale]),&#xD;
      respiratory disease history and risks factors, co morbidities/medical history&#xD;
      (non-respiratory), concomitant medications, previous ADASUVE® treatment (date and dosing&#xD;
      data).&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the 6-month follow-up from baseline visit study staff will conduct a 10-minutes&#xD;
      phone-calls (every 3 months approximately) to the enrolled patients or their family&#xD;
      member/caregiver. Patients (or family member/caregiver) will be asked for general patient&#xD;
      health status. In addition, patients will be reminded to return the medication if they have&#xD;
      not presented a new episode of agitation after the 6 months of follow-up from the baseline&#xD;
      visit. All these patients will be scheduled for the study staff for an end of study visit&#xD;
      with the aim to return the unused study kit. These patients will be excluded from the study.&#xD;
      All this related information will be recorded in the electronic case report forms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Three clinical scenarios can occur following the self-administration of ADASUVE® outside the&#xD;
      hospital setting for the treatment of an acute agitation episode:&#xD;
&#xD;
      • If there is an improvement within 2-hours post-dose self-administration of ADASUVE® outside&#xD;
      the hospital setting and once the episode of acute agitation has dismissed, the following&#xD;
      data will be collected at patient's diary card with adequate family (or caregiver) support:&#xD;
&#xD;
      o Date of the diary completion, person who completed the diary (patient, relatives or&#xD;
      caregiver), date/time of the onset of current episode of agitation, date/time of ADASUVE®&#xD;
      self-administration, , severity of the episode (CGI-S scale) before ADASUVE® administration&#xD;
      and time/rate to improvement of current episode of agitation (CGI-I scale) scores at 2, 10,&#xD;
      20, 30, 60 and 120 minutes after ADASUVE® administration, AEs related to ADASUVE® during the&#xD;
      following 24 hours of the self-administration, medications to treat ADASUVE®&#xD;
      treatment-emergent AEs (e.g., short-acting bronchodilator) and another medication used&#xD;
      following 24 hours of ADASUVE® administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once ADASUVE® treatment has taken place, immediately patient (or a family member/caregiver)&#xD;
      must inform the corresponding study investigator to schedule a follow-up hospital visit&#xD;
      (within 24-72h after ADASUVE® self-administration). The 24-72h follow-up visit after ADASUVE®&#xD;
      self-administration with the study investigator will include a review of data from patient&#xD;
      diary card that will be recorded in the electronic case report forms by the investigator&#xD;
      staff. Additionally, the study investigator will confirm during the visit that the patient is&#xD;
      in good general health based on their judgment and patients will be asked to evaluate their&#xD;
      treatment satisfaction after self-administered ADASUVE® outside the hospital setting using a&#xD;
      5-point Likert scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If there is no improvement or worsening of the agitation after 1 hour of ADASUVE®&#xD;
           self-administration outside the hospital setting, the patient must attend the assigned&#xD;
           hospital for a 2nd dose of ADASUVE® (≥ 2 hours after dose one) or another medication to&#xD;
           treat the agitation episode, at the discretion of the investigator. If additionally, the&#xD;
           patient had reported an AE after the first administration of ADASUVE® outside the&#xD;
           hospital setting and a second dose of ADASUVE® cannot be administered, another&#xD;
           medication should be dispensed at hospital setting to treat this agitation episode.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If after ≥2 hours of ADASUVE® self-administration outside the hospital setting there is&#xD;
           a worsening of the agitation episode (once there was a previous improvement within&#xD;
           2-hours post-dose administration), the patient must attend the assigned hospital for a&#xD;
           2nd dose of ADASUVE® or another medication to treat the agitation episode, at the&#xD;
           discretion of the investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following data until discharge will be collected in the electronic case report forms by&#xD;
      study staff if there is no improvement or worsening after self-administration of ADASUVE® for&#xD;
      patients attending the hospital:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Other treatments administered for agitation episode in addition to 1st dose of ADASUVE®&#xD;
           self-administered outside the hospital setting or to the 2nd dose of ADASUVE® at&#xD;
           hospital administration for non-responders patients (number and timing of doses&#xD;
           administered)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Other treatments administered for agitation in addition to 2nd dose of ADASUVE®.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Date/time of the onset of current episode of agitation&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Time to onset of improvement of current episode&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  AEs related to ADASUVE®&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Medications and/or interventions to treat ADASUVE® treatment-emergent AEs&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Status at discharge (admission to hospital, discharge to home or other facility, ongoing&#xD;
           hospitalization, leave against medical advice, other) All these patients who&#xD;
           self-administered ADASUVE® outside the hospital setting should return the used study kit&#xD;
           at the scheduled visit accordingly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Furthermore, patients will receive a follow-up call at 30 days after the self-administration&#xD;
      of ADASUVE® outside the hospital setting to record the general health status of the patient&#xD;
      including information about any other AEs related to ADASUVE® experienced during this period.&#xD;
