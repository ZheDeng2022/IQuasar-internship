  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether Moral Reconation Therapy (MRT) is effective&#xD;
      for reducing risk of criminal recidivism and improving other health-related outcomes&#xD;
      (substance use, mental health, housing, and employment problems) among justice-involved&#xD;
      Veterans entering residential mental health treatment programs in the Department of Veterans&#xD;
      Affairs (VA).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Approximately 146,000 Veterans are released each year from correctional settings; however,&#xD;
      two thirds will likely reoffend and return to the justice system. Antisocial cognitions and&#xD;
      behaviors are the strongest predictors of reoffending and are highly prevalent among&#xD;
      justice-involved Veterans (JIVs). However, in the absence of treatments with demonstrated&#xD;
      effectiveness with JIVs, no systematic approach to address antisocial cognitions and&#xD;
      behaviors has been implemented in VA. Moral Reconation Therapy (MRT) is a&#xD;
      cognitive-behavioral intervention that aims to reduce antisocial cognitions and behaviors.&#xD;
      MRT has the best empirical support for reducing risk for criminal recidivism among civilian&#xD;
      offenders, and its associated mechanisms (improvements in interpersonal functioning and&#xD;
      impulse control) have been linked to improvements in health-related outcomes that are also&#xD;
      risk factors for recidivism (substance use, mental health, housing, and employment problems).&#xD;
      However, no trials have been conducted with JIVs. Differences between JIVs and&#xD;
      justice-involved civilians (e.g., prevalence of traumatic brain injuries; interpersonal&#xD;
      problems) suggests prior research on MRT with civilians may not be generalizable, and&#xD;
      prompted the VA's Veterans Justice Programs (VJP) and the developers of MRT to develop a&#xD;
      Veteran-specific curriculum of this intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Using the new Veteran-specific manual, the overarching objective of the current proposal is&#xD;
      to implement and evaluate MRT as an intervention to reduce risk for criminal recidivism and&#xD;
      improve health-related outcomes among JIVs in VA Mental Health Residential Rehabilitation&#xD;
      Treatment Programs (MH RRTPs). Using a Hybrid Type 1 design, this project will test the&#xD;
      effectiveness of MRT in a multisite Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT) (Palo Alto, Little&#xD;
      Rock, and Bedford VAs) and conduct a formative evaluation to facilitate future implementation&#xD;
      of MRT in VA.&#xD;
