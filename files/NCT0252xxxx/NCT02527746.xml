      A Phase I, dose escalation study to evaluation the safety and&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics of F-627 in female breast cancer patients receiving 4&#xD;
      cycles of EC chemotherapy (Epirubicin plus Cyclophosphamide).&#xD;
&#xD;
      18 patients (6 patients each cohort) were assigned to three sequential doses cohort of F-627&#xD;
      at the dose of 80, 240 and 320 µg/kg. The patients received chemotherapy (100 mg/m2&#xD;
      epirubicin and 600 mg/m2 cyclophosphamide) administrated by i.v. injection on Day 1 and F-627&#xD;
      by s.c. injection on Day 3 of each cycle for 4 cycles. If no dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) was&#xD;
      observed in 6 patients during first cycle, the next cohort was escalated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood samples were collected for completed blood counts with differential, serum F-627&#xD;
      concentration and safety evaluation at different point following F-672 injection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The decision to proceed to the next higher dose was be made jointly by the sponsor's medical&#xD;
      expert and the investigator based upon the review of safety data in the first cycle&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
