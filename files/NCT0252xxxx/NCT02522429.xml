      Few neurological conditions are as scientifically mysterious and clinically, legally, and&#xD;

      intervention for patients suffering from these devastating conditions. The present project is&#xD;
      aimed at evaluating the potential of non-invasive Low Intensity Focused Ultrasound Pulsation&#xD;

      stimulation for those patients. In this study, LIFUP will be performed during two sessions.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Few neurological conditions are as scientifically mysterious and clinically, legally, and&#xD;
      ethically challenging as disorders of consciousness (DOC). Typically developed after severe&#xD;
      brain injury, this set of related conditions includes Coma, the Vegetative State (VS) and the&#xD;
      Minimally Conscious State (MCS). In the past 20 years, an increasing amount of research has&#xD;
      broken many conventions about these disorders, including the once widespread belief that&#xD;
      these patients are entirely apallic - that is, lack any kind of &quot;higher&quot; activity. Since&#xD;
      then, it has been shown that a lot of brain activity, including relatively high-level&#xD;
      cognitive processes, can remain in DOC patients. Nonetheless, to date there exists no&#xD;
      standard intervention for patients suffering from these devastating conditions. Developing&#xD;
      interventions for this population is extremely important first and foremost for the&#xD;
      well-being of patients, who - today - remain completely dependent on assisted care, are often&#xD;
      unable to participate in rehabilitative programs because of their lack of behavioral&#xD;
      responsiveness, and thus find themselves prisoners of a condition characterized by&#xD;
      uncertainty at the medical, legal and ethical decision-making levels. In addition, these&#xD;
      conditions, which can last indefinitely, also place great emotional and monetary strain on&#xD;
      families, large burdens on care-takers - often leading to increased rates of burn-out - and&#xD;
      large financial stress on medical structures and public finances due to the large costs&#xD;
      imposed by prolonged intensive care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The present project is aimed at evaluating the potential of non-invasive Low Intensity&#xD;
      Focused Ultrasound Pulsation (LIFUP) of thalamus (a key area for the consciousness network)&#xD;
      as a neurorestorative stimulation for patients with severe brain injury.&#xD;
&#xD;
      LIFUP will be performed during two sessions (one occurring after deep sedation is stopped and&#xD;
      the second one occurring just before discharge). The proposed experiment will involve&#xD;
      behavioral (i.e., CRS-R) and paramedical (i.e., MRI/fMRI and EEG) measurements just before&#xD;
      and after each of the two LIFUP sessions (i.e., 5 non-consecutive minutes of stimulation in&#xD;
      each session) in a small sample of patients (up to 15 acute and 15 chronic DOC patients) in&#xD;
      order to evaluate the feasibility of a full scale clinical trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome measures (i.e., GOSE and CRS-R) will be administered at discharge and follow-up. The&#xD;
      duration of participation in the study will be a year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In terms of impact, we think this project would have a number of immediate consequences. (i)&#xD;
      A successful pilot study and any indication that this approach might have the hypothesized&#xD;
      effect would place us in a unique position to initiate a fully-fledged double-blind clinical&#xD;
      trial in a large cohort of patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      (ii) From a purely scientific point of view, by virtue of testing what is today the most&#xD;
      prominent physiological hypothesis concerning loss and recovery of consciousness after severe&#xD;
      brain injury, this project has a direct repercussion on our understanding of the mechanisms&#xD;
      underlying these conditions. (iii) From a clinical and patient management point of view the&#xD;
      present project is the first necessary step towards opening a completely new avenue for&#xD;
      care-taking in patients suffering from this devastating condition for which there is no&#xD;
      intervention. In particular, if this project were successful in the long run (e.g., after a&#xD;
      double-blind full clinical trial), it could make widely available a non-invasive protocol&#xD;
      which could substitute the currently highly invasive (and therefore not widely available, and&#xD;
      high risk) only intervention available.&#xD;
