  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This pilot study hypothesizes that hyperthermia delivered via magnetic resonance-guided&#xD;
      focused ultrasound (MRg-FU) is technically feasible and can be safely used in combination&#xD;
      with concurrent reirradiation and chemotherapy for the treatment of recurrent rectal cancer.&#xD;
      Twenty recurrent rectal cancer patients who are not candidates for surgery will be recruited&#xD;
      for hyperthermia treatment delivered via MRg-FU concurrent with reirradiation and oral&#xD;
      chemotherapy.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Magnetic resonance-guided focused ultrasound (MRg-FU) is a non-invasive, outpatient modality&#xD;
      being investigated for the thermal treatment of cancer. In MRg-FU, a specially designed&#xD;
      transducer is used to focus a beam of low intensity ultrasound energy into a small volume at&#xD;
      a specific target site in the body. MR is used to identify and delineate the tumour, focus&#xD;
      the ultrasound beam on the target and provide real-time thermal mapping to ensure accurate&#xD;
      heating of the designated target with minimal effect to the adjacent healthy tissue. The&#xD;
      focused ultrasound beam produces therapeutic hyperthermia (40-42°C) in the target field&#xD;
      causing protein denaturation and cell damage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently, there is no prospective clinical data reported on the use of MRg-FU in the setting&#xD;
      of recurrent rectal cancer. Recurrent rectal cancer is a vexing clinical problem. Current&#xD;
      retreatment protocols have limited efficacy. The addition of hyperthermia to radiation and&#xD;
      chemotherapy may enhance the therapeutic response. With recent advances in technology, the&#xD;
      investigators hypothesize that MRg-FU is technically feasible and can be safely used in&#xD;
      combination with concurrent reirradiation and chemotherapy for the treatment of recurrent&#xD;
      rectal cancer without increased side-effects.&#xD;
