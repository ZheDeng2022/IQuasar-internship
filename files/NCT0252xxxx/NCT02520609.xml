      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Metabolism refers to the many chemical pathways by which various compounds, including food,&#xD;
      are processed and used in the body. People with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD)&#xD;
      have too much fat in their liver cells, but what causes it is unclear. One explanation is&#xD;
      that people with NAFLD process food and metabolize it differently than people without NAFLD.&#xD;
      Researchers want to compare how food is metabolized in people with and without NAFLD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To better understand how food intake influences the development and progression of NAFLD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      People ages 18 and older with NAFLD or with a non-NAFLD metabolic syndrome&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy volunteers ages 18 and older&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be screened with medical history, surveys, physical exam, and blood tests.&#xD;
      This will have ultrasound of the abdomen. This uses sound waves to image internal organs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will stay at the Clinical Center for 2 nights.&#xD;
&#xD;
      They will fast he first night.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the second day they will:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Have their metabolism monitored in a metabolism research room for 24 hours&#xD;
&#xD;
      Have a catheter inserted into an arm vein for several blood tests&#xD;
&#xD;
      Drink an Ensure Plus for breakfast&#xD;
&#xD;
      Have solid meals for lunch and dinner&#xD;
&#xD;
      Have several urine tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The final morning, they will:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Have more blood tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Have a DXA test to measure the fat in the body. They will lie on their backs for 15-25&#xD;
      minutes while an x-ray machine is positioned over areas of the body.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the most common hepatic disorder in the Western&#xD;
      world, and is a leading cause of liver-related morbidity and mortality. Excessive caloric&#xD;
      intake and specific nutritional components have been implicated in its pathogenesis, but the&#xD;
      complex metabolic pathways linking nutrient consumption with hepatic fat accumulation have&#xD;
      not yet been fully elucidated. Analysis of pathophysiology and the search for biomarkers in&#xD;
      NAFLD has largely focused on fasting samples; the dynamic response to a caloric load has not&#xD;
      been interrogated, beyond glucose tolerance testing. Metabolomics is a novel high-throughput&#xD;
      technique, allowing for simultaneous detection of hundreds to thousands of metabolites, and&#xD;
      the evaluation of their interconnectivity and causal relationships. We propose a pilot study&#xD;
      to investigate the metabolic response of patients with NAFLD to a standardized food&#xD;
      challenge, by applying a metabolomics-based dynamic approach. In this study we will recruit&#xD;
      up to 50 patients with NAFLD and compare them to 12 controls with metabolic syndrome without&#xD;
      NAFLD, and 12 healthy controls. Following an overnight fast, subjects will be situated in a&#xD;
      metabolic chamber for continuous measurement of metabolic rates, and will be given a liquid&#xD;
      mixed meal containing approximately 30% of daily caloric requirement over a period of 15&#xD;
      minutes. The energy expenditure (EE) and respiratory quotient (RQ), reflecting preference for&#xD;
      carbohydrate or fat oxidation, will be measured at 1-minute resolution. Blood will be drawn&#xD;
      at baseline, and at 30 min, 1, 2, 4 and 24 hours after ingestion. Plasma will be separated&#xD;
      and stored in -80 (Infinite)C. Following completion of recruitment, stored samples will be&#xD;
      analyzed at the NCI Laboratory of Metabolism by LC/MS and GC/MS, metabolites of interest&#xD;
      identified, and individual metabolites quantitated and normalized to their pre-prandial&#xD;
      level. Study results will hopefully identify novel metabolic markers of disease, and uncover&#xD;
      altered signaling pathways unique to NAFLD that are activated primarily under fed state&#xD;
      conditions.&#xD;
