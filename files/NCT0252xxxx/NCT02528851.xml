    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to compare the cardiovascular and respiratory effects of &quot;higher&quot;&#xD;
      versus &quot;equivalent&quot; CPAP pressures post-extubation from high endotracheal airway pressures&#xD;
      (EAP), defined as at least 8 cm H2O (water), in the form of a randomized controlled&#xD;
      cross-over trial. Endotracheal airway pressure (EAP) will be defined as mean airway pressure&#xD;
      (MAP) [if on high frequency ventilation] or positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) [if on&#xD;
      conventional ventilation] at time of extubation. Participants will be randomized to &quot;higher&quot;&#xD;
      CPAP group (CPAP level 2cm H2O higher than the extubation EAP) or &quot;equivalent&quot; CPAP group&#xD;
      (CPAP level equal to the extubation EAP) before undergoing crossover to the other arm. We&#xD;
      hypothesize that &quot;higher&quot; CPAP levels, when compared to &quot;equivalent&quot; CPAP levels, do not&#xD;
      adversely impact the cardiorespiratory status when a patient is extubated from high EAP.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Extubation readiness of the enrolled infants will be determined solely by and at the&#xD;
      discretion of the medical team. All enrolled infants will be checked to re-confirm&#xD;
      eligibility prior to extubation. Those enrolled infants who are ventilated on EMV&#xD;
      (endotracheal mechanical ventilation) with an airway pressure of 8-11 cm H2O at the time when&#xD;
      they are deemed extubation-ready by the team will be eligible for randomization. Once&#xD;
      eligibility for randomization is assessed, the study coordinator will notify the research&#xD;
      team who will immediately perform a bedside functional echocardiography to assess cardiac&#xD;
      output and PDA (patent ductus arteriosus) status. In addition, the lung compliance (as&#xD;
      measured by the ventilator) will be recorded. If a PDA exists and is found to be&#xD;
      hemodynamically significant, then the infant meets one of the exclusion criteria and will be&#xD;
      ineligible for randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once eligibility is confirmed, infants will be randomized using sequentially numbered sealed&#xD;
      opaque envelopes. The sequence of the randomization will be pre-determined using a computer&#xD;
      generated algorithm, and sealed envelopes will be created by study coordinator. Once&#xD;
      randomized, the infants will be extubated to the &quot;higher&quot; CPAP group (CPAP level 2cm H2O&#xD;
      higher than extubation EAP) or &quot;equivalent&quot; CPAP group (CPAP level equal to the extubation&#xD;
      EAP) based on their allocation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After ensuring that the infants are stable for one hour (based on pre-defined clinical&#xD;
      instability criteria) cardiac output will be measured using bedside functional&#xD;
      echocardiography by members of the research team blinded to the allocation. To ensure&#xD;
      blinding the research coordinator will cover the relevant digital display of the&#xD;
      ventilator/CPAP machine (with opaque craft paper and tape) immediately prior to the&#xD;
      echocardiography. Other aforementioned outcomes will be recorded by the blinded investigator&#xD;
      using standardized data collection forms. Once all outcome data are collected, the infants&#xD;
      will cross-over to the opposite arm of the trial and a similar assessment protocol will be&#xD;
      followed after one hour. The study protocol will be considered completed when the second set&#xD;
      of measurements is obtained and further respiratory management will be guided by the medical&#xD;
      team.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SAFETY ASSURANCE At any point during the study, emergence of any one of the clinical&#xD;
      instability criteria will prompt the nursing staff to notify the medical team who would&#xD;
      immediately assess the infant. If the infant shows signs of clinical instability the medical&#xD;
      team will evaluate the infants' clinical condition as per a pre-defined checklist. When all&#xD;
      the troubleshooting points mentioned in the checklist are addressed by the medical team and&#xD;
      the infant is deemed clinically unstable, the infant would be immediately removed from the&#xD;
      study protocol and parents of the subject will be notified. To ensure that no other factor&#xD;
      affects the hemodynamic status of the infants during the study, the total fluid intake would&#xD;
      remain the same and no caffeine citrate would be administered during the period of pre and&#xD;
      post extubation assessment of cardiac output.&#xD;

The mean of the maximum and minimum internal diameters will be taken for flow measurement to account for the variation in vessel diameter during the cardiac cycle.&#xD;
