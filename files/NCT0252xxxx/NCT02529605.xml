  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single dose, randomized, cross-over pharmacokinetic study in healthy volunteers&#xD;
      (n=12) of two dietary supplement formulations. The Product B® IsaGenesis® formulation&#xD;
      represents a newer reformulation of an existing product known simply as IsaGenesis®. Beyond&#xD;
      some changes in the relative abundance of some of the constituents of the earlier IsaGenesis®&#xD;
      formulation, the Product B® IsaGenesis® product has been formulated as a liquid-gel&#xD;
      formulation (rather than a dried powder extract) which is theorized to enhance the absorption&#xD;
      and bioavailability of the contained botanical constituents. The purpose of this study is to&#xD;
      compare the two dietary supplement formulations relative to the absorption of two compounds&#xD;
      contained within the supplement known as the flavonolignans silybin A and silybin B into the&#xD;
      bloodstream after oral administration of capsules.&#xD;

      The study involves a total of five (5) visits to the University of Florida Shands CRC located&#xD;
      in the Clinical Translational Research Building in Gainesville, and is expected to last&#xD;
      approximately 6 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening / Informed Consent:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Screening Visit will be conducted in the CRC and is expected to last approximately 1&#xD;
      hour.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After obtaining written Informed Consent, study subjects will be interviewed about their&#xD;
      medical history and the protocol's Inclusion/Exclusion criteria will be discussed. All&#xD;
      potential participants must be nonsmokers, not taking prescription or over-the-counter&#xD;
      medications or botanical/nutritional supplements (inclusive of vitamins). Additionally,&#xD;
      participants are requested to abstain from alcohol use 24 hours prior to the study health&#xD;
      screen lab work or any scheduled study visit should they participate fully in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During this initial visit, interested subjects will have blood samples drawn for health&#xD;
      screening purposes including baseline serum chemistries, complete blood count, urinalysis,&#xD;
      and a urine pregnancy test (women) which will precede a subsequently scheduled physical exam&#xD;
      and possible study participation. Copies of the laboratory results will be made available to&#xD;
      study subjects at their request. Lastly, a 12-lead electrocardiogram will be obtained.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Visits The following section describes the study procedures for the two major study&#xD;
      visits at the CRC following Informed Consent and a satisfactory medical screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following an overnight fast (abstention from eating any food items after 9 pm in the evening&#xD;
      prior to the scheduled visit), subjects will arrive at the CRC the morning of the active&#xD;
      Study Days where they will remain for approximately 8 hours on each day. After checking in,&#xD;
      and under medical supervision, skilled CRC staff will place an indwelling venous catheter in&#xD;
      each subject's arm to facilitate serial blood sampling. Female subjects will provide a urine&#xD;
      sample for a pregnancy test. At approximately 8:00 AM subjects will be administered 2&#xD;
      capsules of either Product B® IsaGenesis® (2 capsules; 1280 mg per capsule) or IsaGenesis® (2&#xD;
      capsules; 1070 mg per capsule) depending on the randomization sequence assigned by the&#xD;
      Investigational Pharmacy Services. Capsules will be administered with 240 ml of room&#xD;
      temperature water which the subjects will be asked to drink in its entirety. Subjects will&#xD;
      remain in a fasted state for 4 additional hours following administration of either&#xD;
      formulation to eliminate any potential effect of food on absorption. Standard meals will be&#xD;
      served to all subjects at least 4 hours post-dosing. The composition and amount of food eaten&#xD;
      throughout the day will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood sample collection and processing will be done by an indwelling venous catheter to&#xD;
      facilitate serial blood sampling, a total of 9 blood samples (~10 ml each) will be taken over&#xD;
      an 8-hour period during each of the two primary study days. Specific time points of blood&#xD;
      collection will be immediately prior to the dose (0 time point), of either Product B®&#xD;
      IsaGenesis® (2 capsules; 1280 mg per capsule) or IsaGenesis® (2 capsules; 1070 mg per&#xD;
      capsule) and at 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This single dose assessment of the Product B® IsaGenesis® (2 capsules; 1280 mg per capsule)&#xD;
      or IsaGenesis® (2 capsules; 1070 mg per capsule) pharmacokinetics will be conducted with each&#xD;
      of the two described formulations as a single dose assessment in a randomized crossover&#xD;
      fashion. Following the completion of the initially product administration and sample&#xD;
      collection, a minimum 7-day wash-out period will occur prior to scheduling each subject's&#xD;
      return for the assessment of the alternate product (under identical study conditions and&#xD;
      collection times).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Exit Visit The investigators will have the subjects return within 7 days of completing&#xD;
      the second study formulation pharmacokinetics assessment to have &quot;exit&quot; follow-up lab work&#xD;
      consisting of a basic serum chemistry panel and CBC as well as urinalysis.&#xD;
