  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Obesity is increasing worldwide and consequently the need for efficient treatment&#xD;
      opportunities. Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) is one of the most commonly performed&#xD;
      bariatric procedures used in the treatment of severe obesity. The surgery results in&#xD;
      significant and sustained weight loss and has a beneficial effect on blood glucose&#xD;
      regulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, some patients experience the syndrome postprandial hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia&#xD;
      years after the operation, with symptoms varying from mild dizziness to confusion, loss of&#xD;
      consciousness and seizures. Larger insulin and glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) responses to&#xD;
      an oral glucose load are believed to play a role in the syndrome, which is not yet fully&#xD;
      understood. There are no current treatment guidelines beside dietary recommendations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to compare different pharmacological treatments on daily blood&#xD;
      glucose variations as well as postprandial hormonal and autonomous changes in subjects with&#xD;
      symptoms of postprandial hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia after RYGB.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) is one of the most commonly performed bariatric procedures&#xD;
      used in the treatment of severe obesity. RYGB has in several studies been shown to result in&#xD;
      significant and sustained weight loss. Moreover, RYGB has a beneficial effect on obese&#xD;
      subjects with type 2 diabetes by improving blood glucose regulation, resulting in remission&#xD;
      or partial remission of type 2 diabetes already days after surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The changes of the anatomy of the stomach and small intestine cause a faster and more abrupt&#xD;
      increase in blood glucose after a meal. As a consequence of the changed glucose absorption&#xD;
      after RYGB and the increased insulin secretion, some subjects experience the condition named&#xD;
      postprandial hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia. Postprandial hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia is&#xD;
      typically seen years after RYGB and the symptoms vary from mild dizziness to confusion, loss&#xD;
      of consciousness and seizures. The condition is characterized by large postprandial blood&#xD;
      glucose variations accompanied by exaggerated insulin and glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1)&#xD;
      responses. Continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) have shown that subjects suffering from&#xD;
      postprandial hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia presents large variations in blood glucose from&#xD;
      values below 3.5 mmol/L to diabetic values above 11.1 mmol/L within the first hour after a&#xD;
      meal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At present, there are no treatment guidelines beside dietary recommendations. Experimental&#xD;
      treatment includes diet modifications, pharmaceutical treatments and surgical procedures.&#xD;
      Several pharmaceutical agents have been attempted in the management of postprandial&#xD;
      hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia, but overall the existing studies consist of few case reports&#xD;
      and case series evaluated primarily by relief of symptoms and not by CGM and hormonal&#xD;
      analyses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is designed as a randomized, non-blinded cross-over study including five treatment&#xD;
      arms. The pharmaceutical agents are: a) Glucobay, b) Januvia, c) Verapamil, d) Victoza and e)&#xD;
      Signifor. The treatment duration is 1 - 3 weeks, except for Signifor, which is administered&#xD;
      for one day only. Each treatment period is separated by a wash out period of 7-10 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sixteen none diabetic women are included in the study. They have undergone RYGB and have&#xD;
      symptoms of postprandial hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia. Moreover, former CGM has shown&#xD;
      fluctuations in blood glucose of more than 5 mmol/L during daily living and with at least one&#xD;
      blood glucose reading below 3.5 mmol/L.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Six days continuous glucose monitoring will be performed at run-in and during each treatment&#xD;
      arm, except for e) Signifor due to the short treatment period. At the end of the CGM&#xD;
      measurement a meal tolerance test (MTT) will be performed. During the MTT blood samples for&#xD;
      glucose measurements and hormone assessments (insulin, C-peptide, GLP-1, gastric inhibitory&#xD;
      peptide (GIP), glucagon, insulin like growth factor (IGF-1), epinephrine, norepinephrine)&#xD;
      will be drawn continuously as well as continuous pulse recording and blood pressure&#xD;
      measurements.&#xD;
