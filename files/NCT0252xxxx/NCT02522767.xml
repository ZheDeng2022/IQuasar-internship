    <measure>Proportion of Subjects With Remission</measure>
    <time_frame>At Week 8</time_frame>
    <description>The proportion of subjects with remission was defined by the Clinical and Endoscopic Response Score: 0 for rectal bleeding; 0 or 1 with at least 1 point decrease from baseline for stool frequency; 0 or 1 for endoscopic score.&#xD;
The Clinical and Endoscopic Response Score ranged between 0-9, higher scores indicating greater disease severity. This score had two components: Clinical Response which assessed subject's symptoms and ranged between 0-6, and Endoscopic Response which assessed objective evidence of inflammation and ranged between 0-3.&#xD;
Further, the Clinical Response component included two subscales: stool frequency and rectal bleeding (each ranged between 0-3 each) obtained from subjects' daily records. The Endoscopic Response component had one subscale: flexible sigmoidoscopy/colonoscopy (ranging between 0-3).</description>

    <time_frame>At Week 8</time_frame>
    <description>The Modified Mayo score was calculated as the sum of the Clinical and Endoscopic Response Score (Range: 0-9, and the standard PGA score (range: 0-3; normal [score=0], mild disease [score=1], moderate disease [score=2], severe disease [score=3]).&#xD;
The statistical test was to be conducted only if the primary analysis was significant.</description>

    <time_frame>At Week 2, 4, and 8</time_frame>

The adjusted changes from baseline and their differences between treatment groups are presented.&#xD;
The IBDQ is an instrument used to assess quality of life in adult patients with UC.&#xD;
Subjects were asked to recall symptoms and QoL from last two weeks and to rate each item on a 7- point Likert score (higher scores equate to higher QoL).</description>

        <title>Proportion of Subjects With Remission</title>
        <description>The proportion of subjects with remission was defined by the Clinical and Endoscopic Response Score: 0 for rectal bleeding; 0 or 1 with at least 1 point decrease from baseline for stool frequency; 0 or 1 for endoscopic score.&#xD;
The Clinical and Endoscopic Response Score ranged between 0-9, higher scores indicating greater disease severity. This score had two components: Clinical Response which assessed subject's symptoms and ranged between 0-6, and Endoscopic Response which assessed objective evidence of inflammation and ranged between 0-3.&#xD;
Further, the Clinical Response component included two subscales: stool frequency and rectal bleeding (each ranged between 0-3 each) obtained from subjects' daily records. The Endoscopic Response component had one subscale: flexible sigmoidoscopy/colonoscopy (ranging between 0-3).</description>

The adjusted changes from baseline and their differences between treatment groups are presented.&#xD;
The IBDQ is an instrument used to assess quality of life in adult patients with UC.&#xD;
Subjects were asked to recall symptoms and QoL from last two weeks and to rate each item on a 7- point Likert score (higher scores equate to higher QoL).</description>

          <title>The Change From Baseline in Health Related Quality of Life (QoL) Scores</title>
          <description>The change from baseline to Week 2, 4, and 8 in Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaire (IBDQ) scores.&#xD;
The adjusted changes from baseline and their differences between treatment groups are presented.&#xD;
The IBDQ is an instrument used to assess quality of life in adult patients with UC.&#xD;
Subjects were asked to recall symptoms and QoL from last two weeks and to rate each item on a 7- point Likert score (higher scores equate to higher QoL).</description>
