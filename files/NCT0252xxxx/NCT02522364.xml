    <textblock>
      Postoperative atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter (POAF) is the most common complication&#xD;
      after cardiac surgery requiring intervention or prolonged hospital stay.&#xD;
&#xD;
      POAF is associated with higher mortality and higher risk of thromboembolic events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, It is yet unknown whether a now event of postoperative atrial fibrillation is an&#xD;
      indication of a chronic arrhythmic disease - a tendency towards developing recurrent atrial&#xD;
      fibrillation or merely a response to the stress of surgery with not recurrence. This&#xD;
      distinction is critical to determine the appropriate therapy. Since recurred events of atrial&#xD;
      fibrillation (Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation) are associated with long term risk for stroke&#xD;
      and thromboembolic evens patients with PAF are treated with long term anticoagulation.&#xD;
      Missing the long term recurrence of arrhythmia may result in under-treatment and pose a&#xD;
      significant risk of stroke.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bio-Monitor is a subcutaneous implanted device that automatically detects arrhythmias and&#xD;
      stores electrocardiogram (ECG) recordings. It will enable the detection of atrial&#xD;
      fibrillation over a period of years and allow correct diagnosis and appropriate treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of the study is to study the long term behavior of POAF, determine the likelihood&#xD;
      of developing paroxysmal atrial fibrillation in patients with POAF and to define the risk&#xD;
      factors for this eventuality&#xD;

      Clinical background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Postoperative atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter (POAF) is the most common complication&#xD;
      after cardiac surgery requiring intervention or prolonged hospital stay . Affecting 10-65% of&#xD;
      patients , this arrhythmia is associated with increased mortality, considerable morbidity&#xD;
      including systemic therombo-embolism and hemodynamic deterioration. Often it will prolong the&#xD;
      hospital stay and increase health costs. Notably, the incidences of POAF is increasing&#xD;
      resulting from an increase in the average age and arrhythmic risk factors in patients&#xD;
      undergoing cardiac surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although a lot of POAFs occur in patients with a history of PAF, there is an important&#xD;
      portion of POAF in patients who have never experienced AF before. In some of these patients&#xD;
      POAF may be the first manifestation of a tendency to fibrillate (that may have been silent&#xD;
      prior to surgery) whereas in others it may be an acute response to the peri-operative stress&#xD;
      that may never recur after the acute phase. A recent study has shown that patients with a&#xD;
      first detected AF episode precipitated by a secondary event (the most common of which was&#xD;
      cardiothoracic surgery) are very likely to have recurrent events. In fact the risk of&#xD;
      recurrence was similar to that of patients with an AF event with an obvious precipitating&#xD;
      factor Current guidelines mainly address the acute management of arrhythmia. Most conclude&#xD;
      that anti-thrombotic therapy is indicated in POAF (IIA) usually if the arrhythmia persists&#xD;
      for at least 48 hours. However this recommendation is based on very limited evidence as there&#xD;
      is no substantial data describing the long term natural history of this complication. POAF&#xD;
      was described as self-terminating but frequently recurrent with a complete resolution within&#xD;
      6-12 weeks . However, this observation was based on electrocardiogram follow-up with no&#xD;
      continuous long term monitoring (ECG holter or loop recorder) and are therefore of limited&#xD;
      validity. Emerging data suggests that AF recurrence rates may be significate ranging up to&#xD;
      24% over 6 years . Still, it is currently unknown how many of the patients presenting with an&#xD;
      acute episode of POAF will develop recurrent events and when, as a result, there are no clear&#xD;
      recommendations regarding the duration of anticoagulantion treatment. The current practice in&#xD;
      cases of POAF of significant duration is to administer anti-coagulation therapy combined with&#xD;
      antiarrhythmic (most often with amiodarone) for 6-12 weeks. The only guideline based&#xD;
      recommendation that is based on poor evidence is to administer OAC to AF patients following&#xD;
      CABG for at least 3 months . Holter ECG is routinely performed prior to the end of this&#xD;
      period and if normal and clinical evaluation is normal the treatment is discontinued, usually&#xD;
      with no additional evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Technical overview:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will be executed using the following devices and services:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  BioMonitor is a subcutaneous implanted device that automatically detects arrhythmias and&#xD;
           stores electrocardiogram (ECG) recordings. It is implanted in a small subcutaneous&#xD;
           pocket, similar to a pacemaker but without the need for inserting electrodes. It&#xD;
           provides high quality ECG recording and has longevity of 6.4 years. In addition it has&#xD;
           wireless capabilities and may transmit data to an external modem (CardioMessenger) and&#xD;
           though it to an internet based network - the Home-Monitoring.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  HomeMonitoring is an Internet-based, automatic, remote, monitoring system that uses the&#xD;
           cellular phone network to enable transmissions of recorded data and alerts from the HM&#xD;
           Service Center to a predefined email address, fax or a cellular phone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study propose The investigators hypothesize that the intermediate and long term burden of&#xD;
      newly diagnosed POAF is significantly greater than currently described. We further&#xD;
      hypothesize that it may be a marker for affected atria representing a greater risk for&#xD;
      chronic arrhythmia. Therefore, we believe that a substantial group of patients presenting&#xD;
      with POAF will have atrial fibrillation recurrences (paroxysmal, persistent or permanent)&#xD;
      requiring long term anticoagulation We also believe that with the help of ILR we will be able&#xD;
      define a subgroup of POAF patients in whom POAF is related to the acute phase and are not&#xD;
      prone to recurrence nor do they need long term anticoagulation In this pilot study we propose&#xD;
      to use an ILR to diagnose both symptomathic and asymptomatic events of atrial fibrillation in&#xD;
      subjects after cardiac surgery. We intend to define the natural history of post-operative&#xD;
      atrial fibrillation and to identify the predictors for recurrent events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To evaluate the incidence of recurrent AF events, during long term follow-up in patients&#xD;
           presenting with newly diagnosed POAF discharged in sinus rhythm.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To identify predictors for the development of recurrent AF events&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To verify the use of implantable loop recorders (ILRs) as tools in detection of AF and&#xD;
           anticoagulant management in POAF&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To evaluate rates of mortality and major adverse events (CVA, systemic thromboembolism,&#xD;
           rapid AF requiring hospitalization) among patients presenting with POAF discharged in&#xD;
           sinus rhythm.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. To identify predictors for mortality and major adverse events.&#xD;
