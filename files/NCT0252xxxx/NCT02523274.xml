      The purpose of this research study is to evaluate the effects of combining physical exercise&#xD;
      with a resveratrol supplementation on the physical function of older adults.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This investigation is a pilot study to investigate the potential of resveratrol, a&#xD;
      commercially-available nutritional product, to enhance the efficacy of physical exercise in&#xD;
      improving physical function among older adults with functional limitations. The overarching&#xD;
      objective of this project is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of an intervention combining&#xD;
      resveratrol supplementation and physical exercise among sedentary persons aged &gt; 65 years&#xD;
      objectively-measured functional impairments. A total of 60 participants will be recruited to&#xD;
      participate in this three month intervention study. All participants will engage in a&#xD;
      center-based exercise program 3/days per week and will be randomly assigned to consume 1)&#xD;
      placebo, 2) 250 mg/day resveratrol, or 3) 1000 mg/day resveratrol. This study will provide&#xD;
      critical information regarding the influence of the combination of resveratrol and exercise&#xD;
      on objectively-measured and self-assessed indices of physical function. The study will also&#xD;
      provide novel biologic information regarding the relative effects of the interventions on&#xD;
      skeletal muscle mitochondrial function.&#xD;

    <measure>Walking Speed changes between the groups at baseline, 6, and 12 weeks.</measure>
    <time_frame>Change at Baseline, 6, and 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Walking speed is assess speed by asking the participants to walk at their usual pace over a 4 m course. Participants are to stand with both feet touching the starting line and to start walking after a verbal command is given, and the time needed to complete the entire distance will be recorded. The faster of two walks will be used.</description>

    <measure>Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB) changes between the groups at baseline, 6, and 12 weeks.</measure>
    <time_frame>Change at Baseline, 6, and 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Investigators will assess lower-extremity function by asking the participants to perform a series of tasks including: walking at their usual pace over a 4 m course, repeated chair stands, and a balance test. Each task is scored from 0 to 4, with 4 indicating best level of performance and 0 the inability to complete the test. A summary score (0-12) is then calculated.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Skeletal Muscle Function assessed by a dynamometer will demonstrate changes between the groups at baseline, 6, and 12 weeks.</measure>
    <time_frame>Change at Baseline, 6, and 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Isokinetic strength and endurance of the knee flexors and extensors of the dominant limb will be assessed by a standard dynamometer.</description>

    <measure>6-minute walk test changes between the groups at baseline, 6, and 12 weeks.</measure>
    <time_frame>Change at Baseline, 6, and 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Investigators will assess exercise capacity of participants using the six-minute (6-min) walk test,</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Late-Life Function and Disability Instrument changes between the groups at baseline, 6, and 12 weeks.</measure>
    <time_frame>Change at Baseline, 6, and 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The instrument includes 16 tasks representing a broad range of disability indicators that assesses both frequency of doing a task and perceived limitation. The instrument uses a scale from 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating higher levels of function.</description>
