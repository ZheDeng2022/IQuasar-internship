    <textblock>
      One arm clinical trial of Nuvaring use for six months among 200 previously contracepting&#xD;
      HIV-negative women (COCPs or DMPA) aged 18-35 in Kenya, where no vaginal rings are&#xD;
      licensed/available for contraception or other indications. This was meant to be a formative&#xD;
      research study to understand the predictors of acceptability and adherence to a contraceptive&#xD;
      vaginal ring, and its immunoogical and microbiological effects over six months of product&#xD;
      use.&#xD;

      Background: Adherence to HIV prevention and contraception technologies is imperfect but a key&#xD;
      to effectiveness. The options currently available to protect women from HIV infection and&#xD;
      unwanted pregnancy (e. g. condom use, abstinence, monogamy) are not consistently available,&#xD;
      practical, or under women's control. Intravaginal rings (IVRs) are an important technology&#xD;
      that can be long-acting and woman-controlled and are being developed for HIV prevention with&#xD;
      and without co-formulated hormonal contraception. Availability of IVRs in sub-Saharan Africa&#xD;
      is limited; hence, it is important to evaluate acceptability, utilization, and biologic&#xD;
      effects of IVR usage among African women. The NuvaRing® intravaginal combined hormonal&#xD;
      contraceptive ring is used successfully in 61 countries worldwide, although not currently in&#xD;
      Kenya. NuvaRing is self-inserted for 21 days starting after the last day of menses then&#xD;
      removed for seven days to allow menses to occur, and has comparable effectiveness to oral&#xD;
      contraceptives. Adherence to HIV prevention and contraception technologies like the IVR is&#xD;
      critical to optimizing effectiveness. In preparation for a potential future Phase 2 trial of&#xD;
      a combination antiretroviral-contraceptive IVR, KEMRI/CDC proposes to examine adherence,&#xD;
      acceptability and biological effects of NuvaRing® among Kenyan women already using a modern&#xD;
      method of contraception.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To assess adherence and utilization patterns for NuvaRing®, behaviourally and&#xD;
           biologically.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To assess acceptability and effect of NuvaRing® on sexual behaviour among women and&#xD;
           their sexual partners in a setting where there is no routine IVR use. At the end of the&#xD;
           NuvaRing® trial, to additionally assess the hypothetical acceptability of a prototype&#xD;
           dual use HIV-prevention and contraceptive IVR among women who had used NuvaRing® and&#xD;
           among women who have never used an IVR.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To assess biologic effects of NuvaRing® including standard safety monitoring and, among&#xD;
           a subset of participants, genital compartment immunology and microbiology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Subjects: A total of 220 women and 20 men will be enrolled in different parts of the&#xD;
      proposed study. The primary NuvaRing® trial participants (Objectives 1 and 2 above) will be&#xD;
      up to 200 young, healthy women recruited from family planning clinics in the Kisumu catchment&#xD;
      area. Fifty of these women will form a biomedical subgroup addressing Objective 3. To augment&#xD;
      Objective 2, twenty trial participants and their sexual partners will take part in a&#xD;
      qualitative in-depth interview, and three focus group discussions will be conducted, one with&#xD;
      study participants and the others with 20 women who were not part of the primary NuvaRing®&#xD;
      trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: Single arm clinical trial with up to 3 month pre-product phase (on oral or injectable&#xD;
      contraceptives) followed by 6 months of IVR use, ending with an up to 3 month post-product&#xD;
      phase during which women return to oral or injectable contraceptives and then exit the study.&#xD;
      Monthly and quarterly follow-up will include adherence, acceptability and clinical&#xD;
      assessments, and HIV and pregnancy testing. Women in the biomedical subgroup will undergo&#xD;
      more frequent visits and collection of genital specimens. In-depth interview and focus group&#xD;
      discussions are delineated under 'Study Subjects' above.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome: The study will improve understanding of adherence to biomedical technologies,&#xD;
      facilitate the conduct of future HIV microbicide clinical trials relying on IVR technology,&#xD;
      and inform public health practice regarding contraception.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  18 to 34 years of age - Age will be verified using a standard national document e.g.&#xD;
             Identity card, birth notification etc., and in case they are missing we will rely on&#xD;
             proxy verification. Everyone in Kenya over the age of 18 is required to have a&#xD;
             government-issued identification card, which includes their date of birth. There is&#xD;

             their year of birth. In such, instances the participant will be asked her age and&#xD;
             birth month. The day of birth will be defaulted to the 15th and year of birth will be&#xD;
             calculated using the available information if not provided by the participant. In&#xD;
             instances, where age cannot be verified, participation will not be permitted.&#xD;
