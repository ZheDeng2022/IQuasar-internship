  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This short pilot study is to assess the tolerance of preterm infants, born below 32 weeks&#xD;
      gestation with respiratory distress syndrome, to flow-cycle ventilation, and see if infants&#xD;
      require less overall pressure from the ventilator than the usual conventional settings used,&#xD;
      with the aim of providing data to construct a larger trial looking at the longer term outcome&#xD;
      of these infants using this type of ventilation in the future.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Many preterm infants at these gestations require assistance from a ventilator due to the&#xD;
      immaturity of their lungs. The lungs of preterm infants are susceptible to damage, especially&#xD;
      if high pressures are needed or prolonged periods of ventilation. There is concern that if&#xD;
      the infant's breathing pattern does not synchronise with the ventilator, this causes&#xD;
      additional distress, longer duration of ventilation needed and increased risk of&#xD;
      complications. Over the past 20 years, a different type of ventilation, known as flow-cycle&#xD;
      ventilation, has been trialed, with limited use in preterm infants. This allows the baby to&#xD;
      determine the duration of breathing in and out and how many breaths they require per minute.&#xD;
      This would help babies to synchronise better with the ventilator, and consequently require&#xD;
      less pressure from the ventilator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This pilot study is being conducted at St. Mary's Hospital, Manchester. All babies born under&#xD;
      32 weeks gestation, with a stable respiratory effort, will be eligible for consideration for&#xD;
      the study. The study will last no longer than 5 hours and involve the babies receiving&#xD;
      different pressures from the ventilator in flow-cycle mode for 1-hour epochs. Blood gases&#xD;
      after each epoch and continuous ventilator data will be downloaded to assess their tolerance&#xD;
      on the different settings, before being returned to the usual conventional settings used on&#xD;
      the unit. The babies will have continuous monitoring throughout as per standard neonatal&#xD;
      intensive care.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will be conducted as a short term, crossover study, where each infant will act as&#xD;
      his or her own control and undertake all interventions within this study. The study is broken&#xD;
      down into two parts in order to answer the two secondary research questions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The limited studies looking at flow-cycled ventilation in preterm babies have been set up in&#xD;
      a similar manner. Making each infant its own control limits the number of infants needed for&#xD;
      this pilot study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Prior preparations regarding protocol design&#xD;
&#xD;
           The protocol has already been reviewed by the University of Leeds, by paper submission&#xD;
           and viva to determine the suitability of the project from an educational point of view&#xD;
           and suitability for the restricted time frame and resources available. Discussions with&#xD;
           the neonatal unit technical support staff have already been undertaken to ensure that&#xD;
           the study ventilators (an exact model to that used on the unit, but mobile) are&#xD;
           configured with the required backup ventilation mode, to maintain the required level of&#xD;
           breathing support, safety alarms and settings checked and the Eview box (device which&#xD;
           allows the collection of data about the baby from the ventilator) installed as per&#xD;
           manufacture guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Training has also been given to the Principal investigator on the setup and maintenance&#xD;
           of the study ventilator (the principal investigator is also a member of the clinical&#xD;
           team who uses these ventilators on a daily basis and aware of how they are used).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Prior clinical care given &amp; assessment for eligibility&#xD;
&#xD;
           Prior to the study, eligible babies would have had a breathing tube inserted and&#xD;
           surfactant medication given due to concerns with underdeveloped / immature lungs,&#xD;
           fitting with being born at an early gestation. They would be receiving breathing support&#xD;
           from the Engstrom Carestation Version 5.X (GE Healthcare) ventilator, the same&#xD;
           ventilator used for the study, and would have received a dose of caffeine citrate&#xD;
           intravenously to aid the infant's breathing drive, in line with unit policy and&#xD;
           international consensus on managing respiratory distress syndrome in preterm infants.&#xD;
           The clinical team may have deemed it necessary for monitoring and blood sampling to have&#xD;
           inserted a catheter into one of the infant's arteries (an arterial line), though this is&#xD;
           not a requisite for the study, but would be used for monitoring and sampling during the&#xD;
           study if the infant was suitable. As per routine practice, the infants will have two&#xD;
           methods of monitoring at all times. This would monitor oxygen saturations and heart rate&#xD;
           as well as having monitoring on for blood pressure, breathing rate and temperature where&#xD;
           deemed necessary.&#xD;
&#xD;
           As both of the Principal and Chief Investigators are members of the clinical team on the&#xD;
           neonatal intensive care unit at St. Mary's Hospital, it is easy to highlight suitable&#xD;
           infants for the study from the patient lists and admissions to the unit, though prior&#xD;
           discussion will take place with the attending neonatal team to discuss suitability. For&#xD;
           any infant deemed potentially suitable after discussion with the attending clinical&#xD;
           team, a parent information leaflet will be given to the parents at the time of greeting&#xD;
           &amp; introducing the study, after they have received an update on their baby's progress to&#xD;
           date. As much time as possible will be allowed between this introduction and any attempt&#xD;
           to answer questions and obtain written consent (minimum one hour) to allow the parents&#xD;
           uncoerced thinking time.&#xD;
&#xD;
           During this time, the research team will corroborate with the attending nurse /&#xD;
           clinician and review the clinical data on the infant, including the x-rays done up until&#xD;
           this time, the nursing observations and blood gas results, in order to assess for the&#xD;
           inclusion and exclusion criteria. An eligibility form will be completed and signed by&#xD;
           both a member of the research team and clinical team to ensure an agreement of&#xD;
           eligibility. If there are concerns, the infant will not be recruited at this time.&#xD;
&#xD;
           At an appropriate time for the parents, they will be approached by the Principal or&#xD;
           Chief Investigator and any questions answered about the study. The research team will&#xD;
           have to be happy that the parents have understood the information, implications,&#xD;
           alternatives and are free to make a choice (as well as being eligible to consent&#xD;
           legally). If the infant is suitable, a consent form will be completed. Randomisation&#xD;
           will then occur by taking a sealed study envelope from the study box to find out which&#xD;
           order they will undertake the different parts of the trial, and will be allocated a&#xD;
           study number, which will be used on all documentation pertaining to the study, to ensure&#xD;
           anonymity. (The study box would already have been pre-made with sealed envelopes&#xD;
           containing information that has been generated from a random number database. The&#xD;
           process of randomisation prevents there from being any influence on the final results&#xD;
           purely due to the order in which the study parts are undertaken, making the study more&#xD;
           robust to analyse. This has been a previous concern with other studies in the&#xD;
           literature).&#xD;
&#xD;
           The study ventilator (an exact model of the ventilator used on the unit) will be set up&#xD;
           and safety checks undertaken, as well as the Eview box (the box which allows the&#xD;
           ventilator data to be extracted and analysed though has no interference with the working&#xD;
           of the ventilator itself) installed, safety back-up modes enabled to ensure that the&#xD;
           infant has sufficient breathing support from the ventilator in the event that they do&#xD;
           not maintain a strong breathing pattern, and the study number and weight of the child be&#xD;
           accurately entered into the ventilator by the research team.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The researcher will then examine the infant to ensure that the time of commencing the&#xD;
           study the infant still satisfies the criteria for inclusion and is deemed 'stable' and a&#xD;
           blood gas sample will be taken from the baby (either from the pre-sited arterial line if&#xD;
           available or from the capillaries in the foot according to standard practice; distress&#xD;
           and amount of blood will be minimised and should not cause any instability). This sample&#xD;
           will be analysed by the machines routinely used on the intensive care unit, and any&#xD;
           other blood tests that the infant may need (e.g. blood sugar monitoring, which is&#xD;
           usually done every 2-4 hours at this stage) will be performed at the same time / on the&#xD;
           same sample of blood (if possible) to minimise distress and interventions. A special&#xD;
           nursing observation chart will be commenced at this time by the attending nurse /&#xD;
           research team, recording the routine observations that any ventilated infant would&#xD;
           require. This first set of observations (on the pre-study ventilator settings) would be&#xD;
           the baseline settings, allowing any deviation from this stability to be highlighted and&#xD;
           acted upon early.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. First part of study&#xD;
&#xD;
           The infant would be switched onto the study ventilator, a process which takes less than&#xD;
           a second, and involves disconnecting the old ventilator tubing from the breathing tube&#xD;
           reconnecting it to the new ventilator tubing. This is necessary in order for Eview box&#xD;
           to work (the original ventilator would have to be turned off for a short period of time,&#xD;
           which would not be ethical to leave the baby without controlled breathing support). Care&#xD;
           would be taken not to dislodge the breathing tube whilst the infant was examined to&#xD;
           ensure that the chest was rising and that the ventilator was receiving data from the&#xD;
           infant. The time on the ventilator would be noted down on the observation chart to aid&#xD;
           with data analysis later.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Depending on randomisation, the infant would either receive a high pressure or low&#xD;
           pressure from the study ventilator.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  All other settings would match those that the infant was on beforehand where&#xD;
                possible. (The high and low pressures are pre-set based on what pressure the infant&#xD;
                was requiring before the study with either 80% of this (low pressure) or 120% of&#xD;
                this (high pressure) these limits are deemed to be safe and within acceptable&#xD;
                clinical practice).&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  The infant would remain on this setting for 1 hour.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Their nursing observations will be recorded every 15 minutes, including a blood&#xD;
                pressure if they did not have an arterial line to read it continuously (this is not&#xD;
                unusual practice as the baby would receive this intensity of observation if they&#xD;
                were having a blood transfusion).&#xD;
&#xD;
           After the end of the hour, a blood gas would be taken, and the ventilator would be&#xD;
           switched to the other setting (either low pressure, if the infant previously received&#xD;
           high pressure, or vice versa). The same process would be repeated in terms of the&#xD;
           timings and observations taken. The time on the ventilator would be noted for analysis&#xD;
           purposes when the pressures were switched.&#xD;
&#xD;
           After the second hour, the blood gas would be repeated and the infant placed back on the&#xD;
           initial ventilator, on a setting appropriate for the condition of the infant at that&#xD;
           time. This completes the first part of the study and the infant would resumed routine&#xD;
           care for a least an hour. A blood gas would be taken after 1 hour as per usual&#xD;
           convention to ensure that they are stable and settled back onto the initial ventilator.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Second part of the study&#xD;
&#xD;
           After 1 hour back on the standard ventilator, the infant would be reassessed to ensure&#xD;
           that they were stable. If this is the case, as stated above, a blood gas would be taken&#xD;
           and part two of the study commenced. The observations recorded would provide a baseline&#xD;
           for the second part of the study. The infant would once again be switched back to the&#xD;
           study ventilator and time noted.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Depending on the initial randomisation, the infant would either receive time-cycled&#xD;
           ventilation (the usual convention) or flow-cycled ventilation (as in part one of the&#xD;
           study) from the study ventilator.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  All other settings would match those that the infant was on beforehand where&#xD;
                possible.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  The infant would remain on this setting for 1 hour.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Their nursing observations will be recorded every 15 minutes, including a blood&#xD;
                pressure if they did not have an arterial line to read it continuously.&#xD;
&#xD;
           After the end of the hour, a blood gas would be taken, and the ventilator would be&#xD;
           switched to the other setting (either flow-cycled, if the infant previously received&#xD;
           time-cycled, or vice versa). The same process would be repeated in terms of the timings&#xD;
           and observations taken.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The time on the ventilator would be noted for analysis purposes when the pressures were&#xD;
           switched.&#xD;
&#xD;
           After the second hour, the blood gas would be repeated and the infant placed back on the&#xD;
           initial ventilator, on a setting appropriate for the condition of the infant at that&#xD;
           time. This completes the second and final part of the study and the infant would resume&#xD;
           routine care for the duration of their stay on the unit. A blood gas would be taken&#xD;
           after 1 hour as per usual convention to ensure that they are stable and settled back&#xD;
           onto the initial ventilator.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. After completion of study&#xD;
&#xD;
           After the study had been completed, there would be a handover of care back to the&#xD;
           attending clinical team with update to the clinical team and parents (if present)&#xD;
           regarding the clinical condition of the baby.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Regarding the data, the encrypted flash disk will be removed from the study ventilator&#xD;
           and the data downloaded on an NHS computer on the unit. This data, along with the&#xD;
           nursing observation charts and blood gas results, will then be reviewed by the&#xD;
           independent consultant neonatologist for safety and quality assurance prior to a second&#xD;
           baby undergoing the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The researcher is responsible for ensuring that the study ventilator is cleaned&#xD;
           appropriately in line with the manufactures and unit guidelines and is ready for any&#xD;
           future participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Safety interventions&#xD;
&#xD;
      These have been highlighted in the main issues question where there is a break from protocol&#xD;
      due to safety concerns. It is clear in the protocol what needs to be done if there are&#xD;
      concerns. Only one baby will undergo the study at any one time and any concerns will be&#xD;
      reviewed by the researchers.&#xD;
