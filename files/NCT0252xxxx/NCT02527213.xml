        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Males or females â‰¥18 years of age who are able to give informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Calcific uremic arteriolopathy (CUA), either newly-diagnosed or pre-existing,&#xD;
             currently on STS or not yet treated with STS and either not on pain medication or on a&#xD;
             stable pain medication regimen. The diagnosis of calciphylaxis can be made when:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  The following clinical features are all present, or two (2) of the following&#xD;
                  clinical features and typical histopathological findings are present.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Clinical features:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. A patient on chronic hemodialysis for chronic kidney disease or with a GFR of less&#xD;
             than 15/ml/min/1.73 m2&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. More than 2 painful and non-treatable skin ulcers with concomitant painful purpura&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Painful and non-treatable skin ulcers on the trunk, extremities, or penis with&#xD;
             concomitant painful purpura&#xD;
&#xD;
        Histopathological findings by skin biopsy when 3 clinical findings are not present:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Necrosis and ulceration of the skin with calcification of the tunica media and&#xD;
             internal elastic membrane of small to medium-sized arterioles of dermis and&#xD;
             subcutaneous fat are essential for the diagnosis&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Concentric stenosis due to edematous intimal thickening is also seen in the small to&#xD;
             medium-sized arterioles of dermis and subcutaneous fat&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. End stage renal disease (ESRD) on chronic maintenance hemodialysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Willingness to undergo washout of pre-existing STS treatment (if required by treatment&#xD;
             allocation) and to continue in a double blind treatment period of 4 weeks, during&#xD;
             which they might receive placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Ability to comply with all study requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. History of allergic or other adverse reaction to STS&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Current treatment with STS for indications other than CUA (e.g. cyanide poisoning)&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Currently on alternative treatment for CUA as listed below. Unless treatment has been&#xD;
             discontinued for at least 1 month prior to the screening visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Steroids&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Hyperbaric Oxygen&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. Bisphosphonates&#xD;
&#xD;
               4. Pentoxifylline&#xD;
&#xD;
               5. Tissue Plasminogen Activator&#xD;
&#xD;
               6. Luciliar sericata larvae (maggot therapy)&#xD;
&#xD;
               7. On Cinacalcet for treatment for CUA (i.e. cinacalcet was either started or dose&#xD;
                  increased after the appearance of lesions)&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Any co-existing disease or problem that makes participation in the study unadvisable&#xD;
             for the patient or compromises integrity of the study&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Cirrhosis of the liver&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. History of congestive heart failure (New York Heart Association class III or IV)&#xD;
                  with multiple hospital admissions (at least 3 admissions in 6 months)&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. Persistent and uncontrolled metabolic acidosis&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Chronic kidney disease or renal transplant patients with diagnosis of calciphylaxis&#xD;
             who are not on hemodialysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Any other disease or condition which, in the judgment of the Investigator, would place&#xD;
             a subject at undue risk by being enrolled in the trial, or cause inability to comply&#xD;
             with the trial&#xD;
