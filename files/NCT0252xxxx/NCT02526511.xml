    <textblock>
      This pilot clinical trial studies perfusion magnetic resonance imaging in diagnosing patients&#xD;
      with kidney tumors. Diagnostic procedures, such as perfusion magnetic resonance imaging, may&#xD;
      help find and diagnose kidney tumors and predict and monitor a patient's response to&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To investigate the utility of perfusion magnetic resonance imaging (pMRI) as a diagnostic&#xD;
      biomarker for the prediction of malignant vs. benign organ confined renal masses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To investigate the utility of pMRI as a therapeutic biomarker for monitoring tumor&#xD;
      progression in patients undergoing treatment (ablation, surgery, specific systemic treatments&#xD;
      such as interleukin 2 (IL-2) or vascular endothelial growth factor [VEGF]/vascular&#xD;
      endothelial growth factor receptor [VEGFR]/mechanistic target of rapamycin [mTOR] targeted&#xD;
      therapies) or active surveillance for organ confined or metastatic renal tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To investigate the utility of pMRI to predict tumor grade and histologic subtype of organ&#xD;
      confined kidney cancers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients undergo dynamic contrast enhanced (DCE), dynamic susceptibility contrast (DSC), or&#xD;
      arterial spin labeled (ASL) pMRI within 30 days of biopsy or surgery. Patients with organ&#xD;
      confined tumors selected for active surveillance or surgery and patients with metastatic&#xD;
      renal cell carcinoma undergo follow up pMRI at 1-6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study, patients are followed up within 48 hours.&#xD;

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must be able to read, understand, and voluntarily sign an informed consent&#xD;
             document&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  For patients with organ confined renal tumors to be enrolled, the renal mass must be&#xD;
             &gt;= 1 cm in diameter on computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)&#xD;
             and can be any clinical stage T1a-T4 (non-metastatic); a histologic diagnosis is not&#xD;
             required for enrollment; the primary imaging site would be kidney&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  For patients with metastatic renal tumors to be enrolled, a histologic diagnosis of&#xD;
             renal cell carcinoma must exist and any burden of disease &gt;= 1 cm by CT or MRI is&#xD;
             acceptable; the metastatic sites may be kidney, intra-abdominal (such as liver),&#xD;
             brain, bone, or lymph nodes; lung lesions are NOT eligible because of the motion&#xD;
             artifact caused by respiration&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with metastatic disease may have received prior nephrectomy and/or prior&#xD;
             systemic therapy (no limit on number); their baseline pMRI would be performed prior to&#xD;
             starting a new treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Negative pregnancy test if female of child-bearing age&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Able to undergo contrast enhanced MRI&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Severe concurrent disease, infection, or medical co-morbidity that, in the judgment of&#xD;
             the investigator, would make the patient inappropriate for enrollment&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Severe renal function impairment (estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR] &lt; 45&#xD;
             mL/min/1.73 m^2) would make the patient inappropriate for enrollment due to the&#xD;
             increased risk of nephrogenic systemic fibrosis (NSF) with higher dose of IV&#xD;
             gadolinium-based contrast agents (GBCA) administration&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Women who are pregnant or breastfeeding&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects who are unable to tolerate or are not eligible for MR imaging&#xD;
             (claustrophobia, metal implantable devices such as pacemaker, aneurysm clips, etc)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects with established allergy to IV GBCA&#xD;
