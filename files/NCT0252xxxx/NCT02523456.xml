      Rationale: Early detection and timely interventions are important determinants of clinical&#xD;
      outcome in people with acute illness. Adverse outcomes including unplanned transfer to&#xD;
      intensive care (ICU), cardiac arrest and death are usually preceded by acute physiological&#xD;
      changes manifesting as alterations in vital signs. Usage of early warning scores (EWS) based&#xD;
      on bedside vital sign observations may help early detection, improve outcome of patients and&#xD;
      reduce healthcare cost.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EWS which are effective in predicting deteriorating patients developed in high income&#xD;
      countries have been shown to lose sensitivity and specificity when applied to a low income&#xD;
      setting. It is imperative to explore the usefulness of EWSs in Sri Lanka. If the results are&#xD;
      positive, widespread adaptation of these scores can significantly contribute to improved&#xD;
      patient outcome, better utilization of ICU services and cost effective healthcare provision.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives: To describe the demographic characteristics of cardiac arrest patients and the&#xD;
      availability of physiological variables for calculation various EWSs in DGH, Moneragala To&#xD;
      validate an early warning score suitable for patients at DGH, Moneragala To examine the&#xD;
      effectiveness of the selected EWS at improving pre-defined patient outcomes&#xD;
&#xD;
      Proposed methodology:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study I: All clinical variables and patient characteristics of past two years collected&#xD;
      retrospectively from BHTs. Vital signs and laboratory measurements 24 and 48 hours before&#xD;
      cardio respiratory emergency and at admission to hospital will be extracted. The availability&#xD;
      of variables required for the calculation of various EWSs will be noted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study II: All consecutive inpatient admissions for three months to all units except intensive&#xD;
      care unit at DGH, Moneragala will be included to the study, prospectively. Data will be&#xD;
      collected from bed head tickets using pre-defined data sheets by nominated medical/ nursing&#xD;
      officers daily. Demographic details and physiological data will be recorded on admission to&#xD;
      ward. Physiological data for seven EWS will be collected twice daily by these medical/nursing&#xD;
      officers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study III: Training will be given for the staff to identify patients getting worse using the&#xD;
      newly validated EWS. The outcome of this will be measured with information obtained from&#xD;
      Study II.&#xD;

      Introduction: Early detection and timely interventions are important determinants of clinical&#xD;
      outcome in people with acute illness. Adverse outcomes including unplanned transfer to&#xD;
      intensive care (ICU), cardiac arrest and death are usually preceded by acute physiological&#xD;
      changes manifesting as alterations in vital signs. Usage of early warning scores (EWS) based&#xD;
      on bedside vital sign observations may help early detection, improve outcome of patients and&#xD;
      reduce healthcare cost.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Effectiveness of EWS in predicting deterioration of seriously ill patients has been&#xD;
      demonstrated in high income countries (HICs). However, these scores developed in HICs have&#xD;
      been shown to lose sensitivity and specificity when applied to a low income setting. It is&#xD;
      imperative to explore the usefulness of EWSs in Sri Lanka. If the results are positive,&#xD;
      widespread adaptation of these scores can significantly contribute to improved patient&#xD;
      outcome, better utilization of ICU services and cost effective healthcare provision.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will take place in district general hospital (DGH) Moneragala, in Sri Lanka, a&#xD;
      lower middle income country (LMIC). The hospital has nearly 450 beds and over 800 staff&#xD;
      members serving over 50000 patients per year and approximately 500 cardiac arrests per year.&#xD;
      It has four medical wards, two surgical wards and 5 other wards. A wedge shaped&#xD;
      interventional study was designed to investigate whether a &quot;setting tested&quot; early warning&#xD;
      system protocol can be implemented in a rural district general hospital of a LMIC using a&#xD;
      local TTT model to reduce cardiac arrests and admissions to ICU.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To describe the characteristics, including EWS, of patients resuscitated at DGH,&#xD;
           Moneragala.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To validate a suitable EWSs at DGH, Moneragala.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To examine the effectiveness of the validated EWS as part of a training and&#xD;
           implementation bundle to reduce the incidence of cardiac arrests, ICU admissions and&#xD;
           mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology Study component 1- Retrospective study All clinical variables and patient&#xD;
      characteristics of past two years (01.04.2013-30.06.2015) collected retrospectively from BHTs&#xD;
      of all cardiac arrests (approximately 200) of DGH Moneragala. Vital signs and laboratory&#xD;
      measurements 24 and 48 hours before cardio respiratory emergency and at admission to hospital&#xD;
      will be extracted. The availability of variables required for the calculation of various EWSs&#xD;
      will be noted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection tool: Pre-defined data sheets. Study process: All clinical variables and&#xD;
      patient characteristics will be collected retrospectively from BHTs. Vital signs and&#xD;
      laboratory measurements 24 and 48 hours before cardio respiratory emergency and at admission&#xD;
      to hospital will be extracted. The availability of variables required for the calculation of&#xD;
      various EWSs will be noted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis: Descriptive statistics will be used to describe the characteristics of&#xD;
      the resuscitated patients. Mean and standard deviation will be used for normally distributed&#xD;
      continuous variables while median and inter quartile ranges will be used for skewed&#xD;
      distributions of continuous variables. Count and percentages will be used for discrete&#xD;
      variables. The availability of physiological variables will also be illustrated using counts&#xD;
      and percentages.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study component 2- The component two of the study is aimed at selecting and validating an EWS&#xD;
      that is capable of predicting cardiac arrest with high sensitivity and specificity A&#xD;
      prospective cohort design, conducted at all units of DGH, Moneragala (except ICU) on all&#xD;
      consecutive in-patient admissions for a period of 3 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size: This phase will be used to determine the ability of EWSs to predict patient&#xD;
      outcome with regards to cardiac arrest, ICU admission and death. Assuming that the best&#xD;
      performing EWS will achieve an area under the ROC (AUROC) curve of .80 and an alpha of 0.05&#xD;
      with 80% power, comparison of an EWS that performs &quot;worse&quot; (AUROC curve = 0.80) will require&#xD;
      28 cardiac arrest patients. With a cardiac arrest rate of approximately 1% (cardiac&#xD;
      arrests/total admissions), and 56,000 admissions per year. this means that each EWS should be&#xD;
      performed on 2800 patients. Under the same assumptions, comparison of an EWS with an AUROC&#xD;
      curve = 0.70 will require n=108 patients with cardiac arrest; thus, 10,800 patients should be&#xD;
      tested with each EWS. With 56000 admissions per year 3 months of phase 2 will be adequate for&#xD;
      this.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection tools: Data will be collected from bed head tickets using pre-defined data&#xD;
      sheets. Demographic details and physiological data will be recorded on admission to ward.&#xD;
      Physiological data will be collected twice daily by these medical/nursing officers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      National Early Warning Score (NEWS), Modified Early Warning Score (MEWS), Standardized Early&#xD;
      Warning Score (SEWS), Patient At Risk Score (PARS), Leeds Early Warning Score (LEWS), The&#xD;
      Assessment Score for Sick patient Identification and Step-up in Treatment (ASSIST), Cardiac&#xD;
      Arrest Risk Triage (CART) and VitalpacTMEarly Warning Score (ViEWS) will be tested in this&#xD;
      phase to select the best performing one, as described below.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis: Data will be analyzed using STATA 13. Selection of the EWS will be&#xD;
      based on the discrimination (using area under the receiver operating characteristic curve),&#xD;
      calibration (using the Hosmer-Lemeshow Ĉ-statistic) and accuracy (using Brier score).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study component 3- The purpose of this component is to examine the effectiveness of the&#xD;
      selected EWS at improving pre-defined patient outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an experimental step wedge design. Study setting and population: Same as study two&#xD;
      Study period: Twelve months Sample size: Currently, early detection of deterioration by means&#xD;
      of EWS prior to cardiac arrest is 0%. The current cardiac arrest team only attends to&#xD;
      patients when a cardiac arrest is detected. It was anticipate that, with the EWS identified&#xD;
      in Part 2 of the study, the early detection of cardiac arrests will increase to 50-75%. To&#xD;
      detect a difference of 50% in one ward, with 90% power and an alpha of 0.05, would require a&#xD;
      sample size of 15 cardiac arrest patients. The estimated cardiac arrest rate at this study&#xD;
      site is &lt;1%. Assuming a cardiac arrest rate of approximately 1%, the selected EWS as part of&#xD;
      EWS should be performed on 1,500 patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This means the study will be powered to detect this in at least 7 of the 12 wards when&#xD;
      investigators implement the EWS over the 12 months it takes to recruit all wards. However&#xD;
      addition data collection for three months will enable (power) to detect this in almost all&#xD;
      the wards.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection tools and study variables Patient data collected from bed head tickets using&#xD;
      pre-defined data sheets. Interviewer administered questionnaires will be used to assess the&#xD;
      success of the training for nurses and doctors. Successfulness of course delivery in each&#xD;
      section will be measured separately. Data sheets will be used to monitor the implementation&#xD;
      of the intervention and outcome measures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study variables include the same variables as in study 2. The indicators to monitor the&#xD;
      implementation of the intervention will also be gathered. Success of implementation will be&#xD;
      evaluated using process and outcome measures. These will include indicators to monitor the&#xD;
      implementation of the intervention (completeness of observations, use of EWS, appropriate&#xD;
      escalation by the nursing team) and outcome indicators (patients suffering cardiac arrests,&#xD;
      detected and missed by EWS, ICU admissions and in-hospital mortality). Data will also be&#xD;
      collected to monitor the success of the training programme (retention of knowledge).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention and study process Introduce EWS: An EWS that is appropriate for use in the study&#xD;
      setting will be adapted and all participants will be educated on this.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Training of staff: The participating Doctors and Nurses from each ward will be trained on&#xD;
      early detection and management of clinically deteriorating patients based on the EWS&#xD;
      selected. The training will be implemented in a stepped wedge method with a new ward absorbed&#xD;
      in to the program monthly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As each ward has the EWS introduced, an acute care training (ACT) course will be delivered to&#xD;
      its staff. The ACT course will comprise of preparation using dedicated e-learning platform&#xD;
      (http://nics-training.com/?page_id=403) followed by a 2-day structured, multi-modal training&#xD;
      package focused on acute care skills for ward nurses and doctors, comprising short lectures,&#xD;
      problem based learning and practical skills stations The ACT course will be delivered to&#xD;
      small groups, fortnightly by a faculty of local trainers (Doctors, nurse tutors and nursing&#xD;
      officers) who have received a five day preparatory train the trainer(TTT) course led by&#xD;
      experienced doctor and nurse trainers (part of investigators' study team) modeled on previous&#xD;
      efforts. As in phase 2, process and outcome data, will be collected by trained data&#xD;
      collectors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow up: Formative and summative training assessments will be conducted on training&#xD;
      participants to measure the effectiveness of the programs, before and after training.&#xD;
      Coaching, support and feedback will be provided to the faculty every two months to ensure&#xD;
      maintenance of quality. Any issues faced by the staff during implementation will be&#xD;
      identified and appropriate remedial action will be taken.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The end points will be proportion of patients detected (and missed) by the system and the&#xD;
      number of unexpected cardiac arrests and ICU admissions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Comparison of outcomes: The &quot;at risk&quot; population will be calculated as a proportion of those&#xD;
      who have actual cardiac arrests, and tested whether this will be at least 50% or 75% whereas&#xD;
      the value is now 0% (there is no systematic detection of at-risk patients currently, with&#xD;
      cardiac arrest team attending only after a declared cardiac arrest. This will be done for&#xD;
      each ward separately as well as to the group as whole. Matched group outcomes for ICU&#xD;
      admission rates, mortality and cardiac arrests will be compared. These will be assessed for&#xD;
      each ward and for the whole group before and after the EWS/RRS implementation. Wilcoxon&#xD;
      signed-rank test and McNemar test will be used to compare non parametric continuous and&#xD;
      discrete variables of matched group outcomes measured, respectively&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pre and post training: The impact of the training on the knowledge, skills and confidence of&#xD;
      the staff in the management of the deteriorating patient before and after the training will&#xD;
      be assessed, as above (appendix C, D and E).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Knowledge retention: Knowledge retention will be measured 3 months and 6 months after the&#xD;
      training.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis: Prevalence of unanticipated ICU admissions, cardiac arrests and&#xD;
      hospital mortality will be calculated for the hospital overall, as well as by ward (using the&#xD;
      total number of admissions as the denominator), before and after implementation of the EWS&#xD;
      selected from component 2 of the study. The effectiveness of the EWS system will be assessed&#xD;
      by comparison of the proportion of cardiac arrest cases that are identified early before and&#xD;
      after use of the EWS. Risk ratios with 95% confidence intervals will be calculated with&#xD;
      shared frailty specified for a ward to account for any within ward clustering. The formative&#xD;
      and summative assessments will be used to compare, in a paired manner, the effect of the&#xD;
      training program on ward staff. The outcome analysis and statistical tests used to compare&#xD;
      outcomes before and after implementing the EWS is described in section 3.5 comparison of&#xD;
      outcomes&#xD;
