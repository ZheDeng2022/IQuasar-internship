      The study design is a prospective, single institution, randomized control trial in which the&#xD;
      introduction of a birth plan is the intervention and a comparison of the rate of Caesarean&#xD;
      sections between participants in the control group (no birth plan) and the experimental group&#xD;
      (birth plan) is the primary outcome.&#xD;

      The study design is a prospective, single institution, randomized control trial in which the&#xD;
      introduction of a birth plan is the intervention and a comparison of the rate of Caesarean&#xD;
      sections between participants in the control group (no birth plan) and the experimental group&#xD;
      (birth plan) is the primary outcome. In addition, a variety of maternal variables such as&#xD;
      epidural use, induction of labour, and excessive blood loss will be collected to be compared&#xD;
      between the two groups as it is anticipated that these could have a confounding effect on&#xD;
      whether a Caesarean section will be used or not. Furthermore, neonatal outcomes such as birth&#xD;
      weight, presence of meconium, and APGAR scores &lt;7 at 5 minutes are also collected for this&#xD;
      purpose. A complete list of all collected variable can be found in the data collection form.&#xD;
      Patients will be enrolled by Dr. Rashmi Bhargava who sees approximately an average of one&#xD;
      patient a day who would be eligible to participate in this project. The investigators aim to&#xD;
      enroll a total of about 200 patients from this group over the next 12 to 18 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Potential research participants will be approached by the PI, who is a staff obstetrician,&#xD;
      during office visits at approximately 34 weeks gestational age. The study will be explained&#xD;
      and if the patient is interested in participation, she will receive the study's consent form&#xD;
      to take home and look over. It will be stressed to her that she is under no obligation to&#xD;
      participate and if she decides not to participate or discontinue participation at a later&#xD;
      time, the standard of care she will receive will not be affected. At the following prenatal&#xD;
      visit (approximately 36 weeks), patients will bring the completed consent form and&#xD;
      concurrently be randomized to either the birth plan group or the control group. Only those&#xD;
      randomized to the birth plan group will be provided with a template to assist them in the&#xD;
      construction of an individualized birth plan. The staff obstetrician will review and finalize&#xD;
      these birth plans and answer any questions the participant may have in the following prenatal&#xD;
      visit (approximately 37 weeks). The finalized birth plan will be taken home by the&#xD;
      participant, while a copy will be made and faxed from Dr. Bhargava's office to the Labour and&#xD;
      Birth Unit at the Regina General Hospital and placed in the participant's file. This way, the&#xD;
      birth plan will available for when the participant arrives at RGH for child birth in case she&#xD;
      did not bring the original with her. All office visits are scheduled as per normal procedures&#xD;
      (standard of care) and are not scheduled solely for the purpose of this research project.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio using permuted blocks of 6. A computer&#xD;
      generated (SPSS) algorithm will be used to create the randomization sequence table before&#xD;
      recruitment starts. Participants will be informed of their allocation at the time of their&#xD;
      consent by their obstetrician.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All data will be collected from the participant's chart, except for her rating of childbirth&#xD;
      satisfaction, which will be collected through the Mackey Childbirth Satisfaction Rating&#xD;
      Scale. This online questionnaire will be completed by patients postpartum using a secure&#xD;
      website (FluidSurveys) as an assessment of their satisfaction in labour. To this end,&#xD;
      participants are asked to provide their email address on the consent form if they like to&#xD;
      complete this questionnaire. Participants will be contacted by email for collection of these&#xD;
      surveys about two weeks after child birth. Participants will be required to list their name&#xD;
      with their responses so the data can be linked to their other data. As soon as the&#xD;
      questionnaire data is collected and the data is linked, the participant's name will be&#xD;
      removed and replaced by her study ID.&#xD;
