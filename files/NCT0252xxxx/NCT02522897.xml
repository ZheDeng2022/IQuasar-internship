  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if additional panretinal photocoagulation of&#xD;
      ischemic areas following retinal vein occlusion (RVO) may reduce the rate of recurrence and&#xD;
      allow longer treatment intervals in anti-Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF) treatment&#xD;
      following the &quot;trea-and-extend&quot; scheme.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with macular edema following RVO receive an anti-VEGF treatment by injection of&#xD;
      Ranibizumab for 12 months in the &quot;treat-and-extend&quot; scheme. Following this scheme, all&#xD;
      patients receive a series of three injections at the interval of 4 weeks. Thereafter, the&#xD;
      retreatment interval is determined by results of certain examinations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The next control including a reinjection is scheduled with an extension of one week until the&#xD;
      patient presents signs of recurrence. Assuming that by the time of recurrence the interval is&#xD;
      too long, the next control (following a retreatment) is then scheduled one week sooner than&#xD;
      the last control. Following this treatment schedule, the individualized retreatment interval&#xD;
      is thereafter kept steady.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Half the patients receive an additional panretinal photocoagulation on visit 3 and / or 4.&#xD;
      Aim of this study is to investigate if this additional panretinal photocoagulation may result&#xD;
      in a longer individualized retreatment interval corresponding to a reduced rate of recurrence&#xD;
      of macular edema.&#xD;
