  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether regularly scheduled HIV sensitization text&#xD;
      messages (SMS) are effective in increasing HIV testing rates among young women in Kenya.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In Kenya, women have higher rates of infection (6.9%) than men (4.4%) and young women aged&#xD;
      15-24 years are over three times more likely to be infected than young men of the same age&#xD;
      group. HIV testing and counseling remains critical to identifying new infections and&#xD;
      preventing the spread of HIV but many young women do not test and still continue to engage in&#xD;
      high risk behavior.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HIV programs have begun to leverage mobile phones and text messages to increase the reach and&#xD;
      scale of interventions. Kenya currently has 32.2 million mobile phone subscribers,&#xD;
      representing a 79.2% country penetration. Text messages have been used successfully in Kenya&#xD;
      for marketing purposes and have even been demonstrated to increase antiretroviral (ART)&#xD;
      adherence. Despite advances in mobile-based applications to improve issues in health, none of&#xD;
      these health applications have yet been able to reach the scale of mobile phone-based&#xD;
      financial products in Kenya.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Given the potential synergies of text message use and need for HIV testing, a randomized&#xD;
      quasi-experimental study was conducted to test whether weekly text messages encouraging HIV&#xD;
      testing and improving HIV awareness would increase HIV testing, enhance HIV risk perception&#xD;
      and reduce high risk behaviour among young women 18-24 years old in a predominantly rural&#xD;
      region in Kenya.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Women in the intervention arm received access to a suite of HIV sensitization text messages&#xD;
      sent weekly to increase their awareness of HIV and encourage them to test with the option of&#xD;
      texting back for more information to a maximum of three times per week. Women in the control&#xD;
      arm did not receive these messages. All women were followed up for six months with monthly&#xD;
      SMS surveys collecting data on their HIV testing practices, sexual behaviour and risk&#xD;
      perception.&#xD;
