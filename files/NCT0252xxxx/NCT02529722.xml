    <textblock>
      IgA nephropathy (IgAN) is the most prevalent primary glomerular disease worldwide and an&#xD;
      important cause of end stage renal disease. IgAN has an incidence of 8-25 new cases/year/per&#xD;
      million age-related population in adults and 3-5/new cases/year/per million age-related&#xD;
      population in children and progresses to need of renal replacement treatment in 5-15% at 10&#xD;
      years and in about 20% at 20 years. The variability of the clinical course anticipates&#xD;
      different treatment options. There is an absolute need of validated biomarkers to predict&#xD;
      risk of progression and indication for treatment at early stages, when lesions can be&#xD;
      reversible. This study aimed to evaluate IgAN progression and its histological and clinical&#xD;
      correlates.&#xD;

      IgA nephropathy is the most prevalent primary glomerular disease worldwide and an important&#xD;
      cause of end stage renal disease. Clinical course varies from long term stable renal&#xD;
      functions with minimal proteinuria and microscopic hematuria to rapidly progressive&#xD;
      glomerulonephritis with crescents on renal biopsy which progresses to end stage renal disease&#xD;
      in a very short time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In current practice the diagnosis is made with renal biopsy. A less invasive procedure for&#xD;
      diagnosis is not present and no serum biomarkers for clinical follow-up, treatment response&#xD;
      and prognosis are available. For that reason follow-up of the disease is enabled with&#xD;
      indirect markers of renal function like proteinuria, serum creatinine and glomerular&#xD;
      filtration rate. These markers are not specific for IgA nephropathy. The lack of disease&#xD;
      specific markers hinders the standardization of patient follow-up and treatment. Development&#xD;
      of specific and sensitive, repeatable, histopathological and clinical markers for diagnosis,&#xD;
      follow up and treatment response in IgA nephropathy the most prevalent primary glomerular&#xD;
      disease affecting many patients worldwide will offer prospects of diagnosis and improved&#xD;
      prognostication.&#xD;
