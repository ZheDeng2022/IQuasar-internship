    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the safety and tolerability of RNS60 in patients&#xD;
      with Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Investigators will also measure the impact of RNS60&#xD;
      on several markers of neuro-inflammation, measured by blood biomarkers and positron emission&#xD;
      tomography (PET) imaging.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a fatal, neurodegenerative disease for which there is&#xD;
      no cure. A substantial body of evidence implicates the neuroimmune system in ALS&#xD;
      pathophysiology. Of relevance to this study, microglia activation in the brain has been found&#xD;
      to correlate positively with faster rate of disease progression. In addition, studies of&#xD;
      blood cells in people with ALS have shown an increased activation of two of the major&#xD;
      inflammatory cell types in the body, monocytes and T cells. Among T cells, regulatory T cells&#xD;
      (Tregs) have been recently proposed to play a role in ALS progression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RNS60 is an electrokinetically altered aqueous fluid. Chemically, RNS60 is composed of saline&#xD;
      and oxygen. The electrokinetic processing of RNS60 in Revalesio's patented Revalesio Pump&#xD;
      (RP) produces charge-stabilized nanostructures (CSNs) that exhibit electrical fields. RNS60&#xD;
      is available for intravenous administration and inhalation. RNS60 has been extensively tested&#xD;
      in preclinical toxicological studies and has shown very little to no side effects. In&#xD;
      addition, RNS60 was well tolerated in three phase I human safety studies, one after&#xD;
      intravenous administration and two after inhalation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preclinical in vitro and in vivo studies in multiple disease models have demonstrated that&#xD;
      RNS60 has broad anti-inflammatory effects. These effects include reduction of microglia&#xD;
      activation, increase of the Tregs subpopulation of lymphocytes, and neuroprotection in&#xD;
      several disease models.&#xD;

    <measure>Blood Biomarkers of Inflammation.</measure>
    <time_frame>24 Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Selected biomarkers of inflammation were measured at Baseline and Week 23 on a sub-set of subjects. Biomarkers included IL-17 plasma levels and FOXP3 mRNA expression in whole blood, a marker of Treg function. Per the protocol, the first treatment was administered on Day 0 (Baseline) and the 24th treatment was administered on Day 161 (Week 23).</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Standardized Uptake Value (SUV) Normalized to Whole Brain Mean (SUVR) at Approximately 60-90 Minutes Post Injection</measure>
    <time_frame>24 Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Glial activation was estimated in a subset of participants by magnetic resonance positron emission tomography (MR-PET) using the [11C]-PBR28 ligand. The subset excludes individuals homozygous for the T/T allele of the Ala147Thr TSPO polymorphism (rs6971) associated with low affinity for [11C]-PBR28. Glial activation was quantified as a mean standardized uptake value (SUV) using PET images acquired 60 to 90 minutes post-injection of approximately 430 MBq [11C]-PBR28. FreeSurfer v6.0 (https://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu) was employed to circumscribe a region of interest (ROI) defined anatomically as the precentral gyrus and the anterior portion of the paracentral lobule, bilaterally. SUV of the ROI was normalized to the SUV of the whole brain and expressed as a SUV ratio (SUVR) to control for inter-individual variability in the global [11C]-PBR28 PET signal. Per the protocol, the first treatment was administered on Day 0 (Baseline) and the 24th treatment was administered on Day 161 (</description>

    <measure>Clinical Outcome: Change in Pulmonary Function From Baseline to Week 23, Measured by Slow Vital Capacity (SVC)</measure>
    <time_frame>24 Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The vital capacity (VC) (percent of predicted normal) was determined using the slow VC method. Vital Capacity is the maximum amount of air a person can expel from the lungs after a maximum inhalation. A subject's VC depends on their age, sex and height. The value is recorded as the Week 23 minus the Baseline of percent of predicted normal.Per the protocol, the first treatment was administered on Day 0 (Baseline) and the 24th treatment was administered on Day 161 (Week 23).</description>

    <measure>Clinical Outcome: Change in Strength From Baseline to Week 23, Measured by Accurate Test of Limb Isometric Strength (ATLIS)</measure>
    <time_frame>24 Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Accurate Test of Limb Isometric Strength (ATLIS) is a non-invasive device that allows measurements of isometric strength in 12 muscle groups of the arms and legs using a standard protocol (elbow and knee flexion and extension, grip, and dorsiflexion). Results are presented as Week 23 minus Baseline of percentages of predicted normal strength based on age, gender, height, and weight using normative data. Per the protocol, the first treatment was administered on Day 0 (Baseline) and the 24th treatment was administered on Day 161 (Week 23).</description>

    <measure>Clinical Outcome: Change in Functional Status Between Baseline and Week 23, Measured by Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis Functional Rating Scale-Revised (ALSFRS-R)</measure>
    <time_frame>24 Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The ALSFRS-R is a quickly administered (5 minute) ordinal rating scale used to determine a subject's assessment of their capability and independence in 12 functional activities. There are 12 questions, graded by the subject 0-4 (4 is normal). Score of 0 (worst) to 48 (best). Reflects change from Baseline to Week 23 in speech and swallowing, fine motor skills, large motor skills, and breathing. Per the protocol, the first treatment was administered on Day 0 (Baseline) and the 24th treatment was administered on Day 161 (Week 23).</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Standardized Uptake Value (SUV) Normalized to Whole Brain Mean (SUVR) at Approximately 60-90 Minutes Post Injection</title>
        <description>Glial activation was estimated in a subset of participants by magnetic resonance positron emission tomography (MR-PET) using the [11C]-PBR28 ligand. The subset excludes individuals homozygous for the T/T allele of the Ala147Thr TSPO polymorphism (rs6971) associated with low affinity for [11C]-PBR28. Glial activation was quantified as a mean standardized uptake value (SUV) using PET images acquired 60 to 90 minutes post-injection of approximately 430 MBq [11C]-PBR28.

        <description>The vital capacity (VC) (percent of predicted normal) was determined using the slow VC method. Vital Capacity is the maximum amount of air a person can expel from the lungs after a maximum inhalation. A subject's VC depends on their age, sex and height. The value is recorded as the Week 23 minus the Baseline of percent of predicted normal.Per the protocol, the first treatment was administered on Day 0 (Baseline) and the 24th treatment was administered on Day 161 (Week 23).</description>
