  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the performance of ColdZyme® mouth spray on prevention and alleviation&#xD;
      of induced rhinovirus upper respiratory tract infection in healthy volunteers. Half of&#xD;
      participants will receive ColdZyme® mouth spray while the other half will receive placebo.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Common colds can be caused by a number of viruses, e.g. rhinoviruses, coronaviruses,&#xD;
      influenza viruses and others. The majority of colds are however caused by rhinovirus&#xD;
      infection, which is responsible for up to 80% of all common colds. This study evaluates the&#xD;
      effect of creating a physical barrier on the pharyngeal mucosal membrane to prevent or reduce&#xD;
      virus cell entry during common cold infection to reduce total virus load and common cold&#xD;
      symptoms in vivo in relation to placebo.&#xD;
