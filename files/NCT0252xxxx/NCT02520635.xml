      The primary purpose of the study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of supra-early&#xD;
      post-surgery chemotherapy versus standard TEMODAL® regimen in treatment of patients with&#xD;
      newly diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme. The secondary purpose is to assess the efficacy of&#xD;
      supra-early post-surgery chemotherapy in release brain edema.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common primary malignant brain tumor. Despite great efforts&#xD;
      have been devoted to promoting the treatment effect, GBM remains one of the most lethal&#xD;
      tumors concurrent with poor prognosis and inevitable recurrence. The standard treatment&#xD;
      protocol for GBM includes surgical resection, radiotherapy and temozolomide (TMZ) based&#xD;
      chemotherapy. TMZ, an alkylating agent, has been proved to be efficient to control tumor&#xD;
      growth after surgery and gradually has been recognized in routine clinical course for GBM. In&#xD;
      a pivotal clinical trial published in 2005, GBM patients received concomitant TMZ and&#xD;
      radiotherapy followed by 6 periods of adjuvant TMZ chemotherapy had a median survival of 14.6&#xD;
      months and 5-year survival rate of 9.8%, which has been regarded as a landscape in treatment&#xD;
      history of GBM. To date, this regimen remains the standard protocol for newly diagnosed GBM&#xD;
      patients. However, the optimal timing of initiation of TMZ or radiotherapy remains unclear.&#xD;
      Our previous study showed 75mg per square meter of body surface per day (mg/m2/d) of TMZ&#xD;
      chemotherapy alone was effective to control post-operative edema caused by tumor cell&#xD;
      infiltration in primary GBM patients. The result suggested anti-cancer agents such as TMZ may&#xD;
      be a useful regimen to control tumor cell regrowth after operation. Therefore, we conducted&#xD;
      this prospective clinical trial to testify the hypothesis that supra-early initiation of TMZ&#xD;
      chemotherapy in newly diagnosed GBM patients is effective to control tumor growth after tumor&#xD;
      resection and therefore improve patients'clinical outcome.&#xD;

    <description>4 weeks after surgery, patients are administered with radiotherapy that consisted of fractionated focal irradiation at a dose of 2 Gy per fraction given once daily 5 dyas a week over a period of 6 weeks. Concomitant TEMODAL® are administered orally at a daily dose of 75mg/m2 from the first day of radiotherapy until the last day of radiotherapy, but for no longer than 49 days. After a 4-week break, patients were then to receive up to 6 cycles of adjuvant TEMODAL® chemotherapy according to the standard 5-day schedule every 28 days.The dose is 150mg/m2 once daily for cycle 1 and is increase to 200mg/m2 at the beginning of cycle 2, so long as there were no hematologic toxic effects.</description>
