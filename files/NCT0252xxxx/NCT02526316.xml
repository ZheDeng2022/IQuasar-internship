      The study will include 10 patients with HPV-associated ano-genital cancer (cervical, vulvar,&#xD;
      vaginal, penile, anal) or HPV-associated head and neck cancer, who are planned to receive a&#xD;
      cisplatin-based chemotherapy (alternatively a carboplatin-based chemotherapy may be selected&#xD;
      by investigators choice). Patients will receive P16_37-63 peptide (100 µg) combined with&#xD;
      Montanide® ISA-51 VG subcutaneously once a week for four weeks, followed by a 4 week rest&#xD;
      period (1 cycle). The vaccination is to be started one week before the initiation or&#xD;
      continuation of the cisplatin-based chemotherapy. Concurrent radiation is allowed and should&#xD;
      be documented. The vaccination schedule will be repeated up to a total of 3 cycles (= 6&#xD;
      months) or until progression or intolerable toxicity. If chemotherapy is withheld (e.g. for&#xD;
      toxicity), vaccination treatment can be continued.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      10 patients with HPV- and p16INK4a-positive cervical, vulvar, vaginal, penile, anal or head&#xD;
      and neck cancer will be enrolled. The p16INK4a-peptide (p16INK4a-37-63, 100 mcg) mixed with&#xD;
      MONTANIDE ISA-51 VG (0.3 ml) will be administered subcutaneously once weekly for four weeks,&#xD;
      followed by a 4-week rest period (1 cycle). This schedule will be repeated for a total of 3&#xD;
      cycles (= 6 months) or until tumor progression or intolerable toxicity is documented. The&#xD;
      first application will be done one week before chemotherapy initiation or continuation.&#xD;
      Concurrent radiation is allowed and should be documented. If chemotherapy is withhold for&#xD;
      toxicity, vaccination treatment can be continued.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be seen at baseline/screening and at every visit for safety assessment until&#xD;
      disease progression or discontinuation of trial therapy for other reasons. Immunological&#xD;
      assessments will be made in all patients. The immunological assessment includes the delayed&#xD;
      time hypersensitivity response (DTH) against the P16_37-63 peptide. Therefore in week 1, 9,&#xD;
      17 and 25, 30 mcg P16_37-63 peptide solution without MONTANIDE ISA-51 VG will be injected at&#xD;
      a separate site from the vaccination site intradermally. Immunological responses are&#xD;
      evaluated at baseline and after vaccination in weeks 9, 17 and 25 (ELISPOT) and in weeks 1,&#xD;
      3, 9, 11, 17, 19 and 25 (ELISA) and are compared to the antigen-specific immune response&#xD;
      measured before vaccination (week 1). Radiological tumor assessment (CT, MRI) will be&#xD;
      performed at baseline and then every 8 weeks (after every cycle). There will be a follow- up&#xD;
      visit four weeks after the last vaccination for safety. Further follow-up regarding&#xD;
      progression and death can be performed, e.g. via a phone call. Autoimmunity will be assessed&#xD;
      every 8 weeks. Safety of the immunization will be analyzed as assessed by the number and&#xD;
      severity of adverse events categorized according to CTC criteria&#xD;
