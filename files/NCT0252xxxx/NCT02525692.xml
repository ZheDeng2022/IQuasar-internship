    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Histologically confirmed World Health Organization Grade IV glioblastoma. WHO Grade IV&#xD;
        gliomas will be allowed on protocol. For Arm D: Must have a WHO Grade IV glioma as per&#xD;
        above and tumor must harbor a histone H3 K27M mutation as evidenced by testing any tumor&#xD;
        sample with an immunohistochemistry or DNA sequencing test. For Arm E: Must have clinical&#xD;
        and/or radiographic evidence of a diffuse midline glioma defined as a WHO Grade IV glioma&#xD;
        involving the brainstem, thalamus or spinal cord and be eligible for salvage surgical&#xD;
        resection as deemed by the site Investigator. For Arm F: Must have a diffuse midline&#xD;
        glioma, defined as a WHO Grade IV glioma involving the brainstem, thalamus or spinal cord,&#xD;
        without the H3 K27M mutation or with unknown H3 mutation status.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Unequivocal evidence of progressive disease on contrast-enhanced brain computerized&#xD;
        tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) as defined by Response Assessment in&#xD;
        Neuro-Oncology Criteria (RANO), or have documented recurrent glioblastoma on diagnostic&#xD;
        biopsy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Previous first line therapy with at least radiotherapy and temozolomide. For Arms D, E, and&#xD;
        F, previous first line therapy with at least radiotherapy&#xD;
&#xD;
        For Arm A or D: Any number of recurrences are allowable. For Arm B: First recurrence (only)&#xD;
        WHO Grade glioma. First recurrence is defined as progression following initial therapy&#xD;
        (i.e., radiation ± chemotherapy). For participants who had prior therapy with radiation or&#xD;
        chemotherapy for a low-grade glioma, the surgical diagnosis of a high-grade glioma will be&#xD;
        considered the first recurrence. For patients who did not get additional treatment&#xD;
        following surgery and diagnosis of low-grade glioma, surgical diagnosis of high grade&#xD;
        glioma will not be considered the first recurrence. Instead, progression after treatment&#xD;
        will be considered first recurrence. For Arm C: Patients must have clinical and/or&#xD;
        radiographic evidence of first recurrence of glioblastoma and be eligible for salvage&#xD;
        surgical resection as deemed by the site Investigator. For Arm E: Patients must have&#xD;
        clinical and/or radiographic evidence of recurrence of diffuse midline glioma defined as a&#xD;
        WHO Grade IV glioma involving the pons, thalamus or spinal cord, and be eligible for&#xD;
        salvage surgical resection as deemed by the site Investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Must be 12 weeks from radiotherapy. If patients are within 12 weeks of radiotherapy, then&#xD;
        the progressive lesion must be outside of the high-dose radiation target volume or have&#xD;
        unequivocal evidence of progressive tumor on a biopsy specimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
        From the projected start of scheduled study treatment, the following time periods must have&#xD;
        elapsed: 5 half-lives from any investigational agent, 4 weeks from cytotoxic therapy&#xD;
        (except 23 days for temozolomide and 6 weeks from nitrosoureas), 6 weeks from antibodies,&#xD;
        or 4 weeks (or 5 half-lives, whichever is shorter) from other anti-tumor therapies.&#xD;
&#xD;
        All adverse events Grade &gt; 1 related to prior therapies (chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and/or&#xD;
        surgery) must be resolved, except for alopecia.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Male or Female age ≥16 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Karnofsky Performance Status (KPS) ≥ 60% (see Appendix A).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Adequate organ and marrow function as defined below, all screening labs should be performed&#xD;
        within 14 days of treatment initiation:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  leukocytes ≥ 3,000/mcL&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  absolute neutrophil count ≥ 1,500/mcL&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  platelets ≥ 100,000/mcL&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  hemoglobin &gt; 8.0 mg/dL&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  total bilirubin &lt; 2.0 x upper limit of normal&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  AST (SGOT)/ALT (SGPT) ≤2.5 × upper limit of normal creatinine OR creatinine clearance&#xD;
             ≥60 mL/min/1.73 m2 for patients with creatinine levels above normal.&#xD;
&#xD;
        CT or MRI within 14 days prior to start of study drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Corticosteroid dose must be stable or decreasing for at least 5 days prior to the scan. For&#xD;
        Arm B: Corticosteroid dose must be stable or decreasing for at least 2 weeks prior to study&#xD;
        entry.&#xD;
&#xD;
        The effects of ONC201 on the developing human fetus are unknown. For this reason, women of&#xD;
        childbearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or&#xD;
        barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry and for the duration of&#xD;
        study participation. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while she or&#xD;
        her partner is participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician&#xD;
        immediately. Male subjects should agree to use adequate method of contraception starting&#xD;
        with the first dose of study therapy through 120 days after the last dose of therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Archival tissue for evaluation of correlative objectives (if available). Archival tissue is&#xD;
        required for Arms B and C.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic&#xD;
        composition to ONC201 or its excipients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Current or planned participation in a study of an investigational agent or using an&#xD;
        investigational device.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active&#xD;
        infection or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study&#xD;
        requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Active infection requiring systemic therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Prior stereotactic radiotherapy, convection enhanced delivery (CED) or brachytherapy must&#xD;
        have had a biopsy to confirm radiographic progression is consistent with progressive tumor&#xD;
        and not treatment-related necrosis. If the recurrent lesion is outside of any prior&#xD;
        high-dose radiation target volume or distant from the prior CED or brachytherapy site,&#xD;
        subjects will be considered eligible&#xD;
&#xD;
        Pregnant women because ONC201 is novel agent with unknown potential for teratogenic or&#xD;
        abortifacient effects. Because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in&#xD;
        nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with ONC201, breastfeeding should be&#xD;
        discontinued if the mother is treated with ONC201.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Known HIV-positive test on combination antiretroviral therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
        Tumors with isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1) or IDH2 mutations as determined by&#xD;
        immunohistochemistry for the IDH1 R132H variant or by direct sequencing. IDH1/2-mutant&#xD;
        gliomas have a markedly longer overall survival rate compared to those with IDH1/2-wildtype&#xD;
        glioma (Parsons et al., 2008; Yan et al., 2009), indicating IDH1/2-mutant gliomas have a&#xD;
        distinct natural history.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Known additional malignancy that is progressing or requires active treatment within 3 years&#xD;
        of start of study drug. Exceptions include basal cell carcinoma of the skin, squamous cell&#xD;
        carcinoma of the skin, or in situ cervical cancer that has undergone potentially curative&#xD;
        therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Any surgery (not including minor diagnostic procedures such as lymph node biopsy) within 2&#xD;
        weeks of baseline disease assessments; or not fully recovered from any side effects of&#xD;
        previous procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;

        72 hours prior to starting study drug administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Concomitant use of potent CYP3A4/5 inducers, which include enzyme inducing antiepileptic&#xD;
        drugs (EIAEDs) (see Appendix B), during the treatment phase of the study and within 2 weeks&#xD;
        prior to starting treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Planned concurrent use Optune™. Prior use of the device is allowable.&#xD;
&#xD;
        For Arm D and F: Evidence of leptomeningeal spread of disease.&#xD;
