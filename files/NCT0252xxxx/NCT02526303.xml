      The purpose of this study is to determine the safety and efficacy of anticoagulation in the&#xD;
      treatment of non-occlusive portal vein thrombosis in patients with liver cirrhosis.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Portal vein thrombosis is a common complication of liver cirrhosis, especially at the&#xD;
      decompensated or advanced stage. The reported prevalence was 10-25% by ultrasound. The effect&#xD;
      of PVT on the natural history of liver cirrhosis is not clear, especially the non-occlusive&#xD;
      PVT. According to a recent large prospective study (n=1243), the development of PVT and the&#xD;
      progression of liver disease are two separate consequences of a common mechanism. It was&#xD;
      hypothesized that the activation of coagulation factors in the cirrhotic liver or the portal&#xD;
      venous system is the common mechanism for the progression of liver disease, on the one hand,&#xD;
      and the development of PVT on the other. A recent randomized clinical trial has shown that&#xD;
      enoxaparin therapy for 48 weeks can prevent disease progression and PVT in patients with&#xD;
      Child class B-C cirrhosis. Besides, emerging evidences have shown that 30-50% of patients&#xD;
      with cirrhosis and partial PVT can achieve this spontaneous recanalization. So what the role&#xD;
      of anticoagulation played in the management of PVT in liver cirrhosis is still contraversal.&#xD;
      Anticoagulation therapy was also shown very effective with a high recanalization rate of&#xD;
      42-100%. But this data was mostly derived from retrospective, non-randomized study and no&#xD;
      well-designed randomized controlled trial has been conducted to evaluate the safety and&#xD;
      efficacy of anticoagulation for non-occlusive PVT.&#xD;
