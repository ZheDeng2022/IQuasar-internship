  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research study is evaluating the use of specialized testing of solid tumors including&#xD;
      sequencing. The process of performing these specialized tests is called tumor profiling. The&#xD;
      tumor profiling may result in identifying changes in genes of the tumor that indicate that a&#xD;
      particular therapy may have activity. This is called an individualized cancer therapy (iCat)&#xD;
      recommendation. The results of the tumor profiling and, if applicable, the iCat&#xD;
      recommendation will be returned.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with extra-cranial (not in the brain) solid tumors that are either difficult to&#xD;
      diagnose or more difficult to treat are eligible to participate in this study. All enrolled&#xD;
      patients will have targeted sequencing of tumor performed. Sequencing results will be&#xD;
      reviewed for clinically significant findings including determination of whether any mutations&#xD;
      exist that suggest potential for activity of a targeted therapy (iCat recommendation).&#xD;
      Results will be returned to the patient's oncologist and follow-up data will be collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this prospective multi-center cohort study, the primary objective is to describe the&#xD;
      outcomes of pediatric patients with advanced solid tumors according to whether or not they&#xD;
      received of targeted therapy matched to an iCat recommendation. The primary clinical outcome&#xD;
      of interest is the endpoint of overall survival (OS), with progression-free survival and&#xD;
      response rate (RR) as key secondary clinical outcome measures. To address this hypothesis,&#xD;
      825 patients will enroll from an anticipated 11 participating institutions over 3 years.&#xD;
