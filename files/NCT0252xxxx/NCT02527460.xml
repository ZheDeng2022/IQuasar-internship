      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      HIV can sometimes cause HIV-associated neurocognitive disorder, or HAND. HAND is&#xD;
      HIV-associated neurocognitive disorder. It can affect memory, thinking, or concentration. It&#xD;
      can cause mood changes. HAND may be caused by HIV hiding in the central nervous system then&#xD;
      causing inflammation. Researchers want to see if a drug for inflammation (Anakinra) can help&#xD;
      people with HIV.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To see if a drug for inflammatory diseases is safe for people with HIV-infection on&#xD;
      antiretroviral therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adults 18-61 years old with HIV who are enrolled in another study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be screened with medical history, physical exam, and blood and urine tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have up to 15 study visits over 16 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At study visit 1, participants will have:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Screening tests repeated.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans. They will lie on a table that slides into&#xD;
           a metal cylinder in a strong magnetic field. They will get a dye inserted by a thin&#xD;
           plastic tube in a vein.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Lumbar puncture. The lower back will be numbed. A needle will collect fluid from between&#xD;
           bones in the back.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Tests of memory, thinking, and attention. Participants may also fill out forms and do&#xD;
           tasks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will learn how to inject the study drug. Over 8 weeks, they will give themselves&#xD;
      the study drug at home every day. They will do up to 3 injections at once. They will write&#xD;
      down their injections and any side effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have 5 weekly visits while taking the study drug. They will answer&#xD;
      questions and have blood drawn.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At weeks 8 and 16, they will have a visit that repeats visit 1.&#xD;

      Objective: HIV persists as a reservoir in the brain in several different cell types,&#xD;
      including macrophages, microglia and astrocytes, and this reservoir persists even when&#xD;
      antiretroviral therapy (ART) suppresses the virus in blood. This viral persistence in the CNS&#xD;
      is thought to cause neuroinflammation through the release of inflammatory cytokines and&#xD;
      chemokines. HIV-infected patients who have evidence of neuroinflammation in CSF are more&#xD;
      likely to have cognitive impairment even when the virus is optimally treated with ART. This&#xD;
      cognitive impairment, currently named HIV-associated neurocognitive disorder (HAND), affects&#xD;
      20-37% of the HIV-infected and ART-treated population. Without ART, the rates of severe HAND&#xD;
      are incredibly high, but in the current era in areas where ART is widely available, the&#xD;
      cognitive deficits are often subtle. Despite this reduction in the degree of impairment and&#xD;
      fewer cases of overt dementia, patients with HAND have poor medication adherence, problems&#xD;
      with decision making, vocational disability, and an overall reduced quality of life compared&#xD;
      to HIV-infected patients without cognitive impairment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This phase 1 study of anakinra will investigate the safety of anakinra in patients with HIV&#xD;
      on antiretroviral therapy. Anakinra, an IL-1 receptor antagonist that has broad&#xD;
      anti-inflammatory effects, has demonstrated safety and efficacy in two other inflammatory&#xD;
      diseases (rheumatoid arthritis and neonatal onset multisystem inflammatory disorder) for&#xD;
      which it is FDA-approved. It has not yet been used in patients with HIV infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population: The study will be conducted simultaneously at two centers: the NIH Clinical&#xD;
      Center and the Johns Hopkins University (JHU) Department of Neurology and will enroll twelve&#xD;
      participants with HIV infection on antiretroviral therapy. Approximately half of the patients&#xD;
      will be enrolled at each site. The study will not enroll patients with evidence of dementia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: This is a single-arm, open-label study of anakinra. Participants will self-administer&#xD;
      daily injections of anakinra for 8 weeks. The dose will be increased over the first four&#xD;
      weeks to minimize injection site reactions. Participants will be evaluated prior to the first&#xD;
      dose of anakinra, weekly during the first five weeks, at the end of anakinra administration,&#xD;
      and after an 8-week follow-up period without anakinra.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients enrolled at the NIH will complete all visits there. Patients enrolled at JHU will&#xD;
      complete all visits there with the exception of the three study MRI s which will be completed&#xD;
      at the NIH.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome Measures: Safety will be assessed throughout the 8 weeks of treatment and during the&#xD;
      8-week followup period. The anti-inflammatory effects of anakinra will be explored through&#xD;
      analyses of cerebrospinal fluid and magnetic resonance imaging results before and after&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
