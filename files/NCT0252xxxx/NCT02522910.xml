      This study part will be conducted in an open-label, non-randomized, Phase I conventional 3+3&#xD;
      dose-escalating design to define the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and MTD of BAY&#xD;

      dose-escalating design to define the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and MTD of BAY&#xD;

      in subjects with second- or third-line NSCLC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The number of subjects treated in the dose-escalation part depends on the number of dose-&#xD;
      escalation or de-escalation steps needed to determine the MTD of BAY 1000394 (Roniciclib) in&#xD;
      combination with docetaxel in this subject population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects treated at the recommended phase II dose level within the Phase Ib part of the study&#xD;
      will be included in the response evaluation of the Phase II part.&#xD;

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Screening must be performed within 14 days prior to the first dose of study drug. Subjects&#xD;
        are eligible for inclusion in this study if all of the following criteria are met:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Histologically or cytologically confirmed stage IIIB or IV NSCLC Patients who received&#xD;
             prior 1 or 2 lines of systemic anticancer therapy. For EGFR mutated or ALK rearranged&#xD;
             patients, EGFR TKI or ALK inhibitor is also considered a line of systemic therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Documented progressive disease after platinum-containing doublet chemotherapy&#xD;
             (Platinum-containing chemotherapy given as an neoadjuvant/adjuvant chemotherapy, or&#xD;
             definitive concurrent chemoradiotherapy within 6 months can be considered as one line&#xD;
             of chemotherapy)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  For patients who showed non-progressive disease with 1st line platinum-doublet&#xD;
             chemotherapy, continuation maintenance therapy is not considered a line of therapy,&#xD;
             whereas switch maintenance therapy is considered another line of therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  EGFR mutated or ALK rearranged patients can be eligible after one line of EGFR TKI or&#xD;
             ALK inhibitor and platinum-doublet chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any prior systemic anticancer therapy must have been completed at least 3 weeks prior&#xD;
             to initiation of study medication. Palliative radiation, whole brain radiotherapy&#xD;
             (WBRT), or gamma knife surgery (GKS) for brain metastases must have been completed at&#xD;
             least 2 weeks prior to initiation of study medication. Major or minor surgery must&#xD;
             have been completed at least 4 or 2 weeks prior to initiation of study medication,&#xD;
             respectively. Majority or minority of surgery can be decided at the investigator's&#xD;
             discretion. Any acute toxicity must have recovered to Grade ≤ 1 (except alopecia).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Male or female subjects aged ≥18 years&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  At least one measurable lesion based on RECIST 1.1&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Availability of tumor tissue for molecular analysis is not mandatory (presence of&#xD;
             archival tissue or re-biopsy for acquisition of tumor tissue is strongly recommended)&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Subjects are to be excluded from the study if they display any of the following criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prior radiotherapy (local palliative radiotherapy is permitted but must have occurred&#xD;
             ≥2 weeks and subject must have no Grade 3 or 4 toxicities prior to first dose of study&#xD;
             treatment; palliative is defined as not intended to cure but to relieve symptoms and&#xD;
             reduce suffering)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Eligibility for local therapy (surgery or radiotherapy)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Previous treatment with any CDK inhibitors or docetaxel&#xD;

             symptomatic brain or leptomeningeal metastases, if subjects are stable for 2 weeks&#xD;
             without steroid and the dosage of anti-convulsant is stable for 2 weeks, they are&#xD;
             eligible. Asymptomatic central nervous system metastases are eligible if the subject&#xD;
             has no abnormal findings on neurologic examination and is not receiving corticosteroid&#xD;
