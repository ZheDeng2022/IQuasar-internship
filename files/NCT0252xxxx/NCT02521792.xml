  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Fibrodysplasia Ossificans Progressiva (FOP) is a rare, severely disabling disease&#xD;
      characterized by painful, recurrent episodes of soft tissue swelling (flare-ups) that result&#xD;
      in abnormal bone formation (heterotopic ossification or HO) in muscles, tendons, and&#xD;
      ligaments. Flare-ups begin early in life and may occur spontaneously or after soft tissue&#xD;
      trauma, vaccinations, or influenza infections. Recurrent flare-ups progressively restrict&#xD;
      movement by locking joints leading to cumulative loss of function and disability. Mouse&#xD;
      models of FOP have demonstrated the ability of retinoic acid receptor gamma (RARγ) agonists&#xD;
      such as palovarotene to prevent HO following injury. This 36-month study will evaluate the&#xD;
      long-term safety and efficacy of episodic treatment with palovarotene for flare-ups in FOP&#xD;
      subjects who successfully complete two flare-up treatment periods (6 weeks duration) and two&#xD;
      follow-up periods (6 weeks duration) in Study PVO-1A-202.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this Phase 2, open-label, multicenter, single-arm, extension study&#xD;
      is to investigate the safety and efficacy of episodic treatment with palovarotene in FOP&#xD;
      subjects with flare-ups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives are:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The effect of episodic treatment of flare-ups with palovarotene on range of motion (ROM) as&#xD;
      assessed by the subject global assessment of movement.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The effect of episodic treatment of flare-ups with palovarotene on ROM as assessed by&#xD;
           the Cumulative Analogue Joint Involvement Scale for FOP (CAJIS) for subjects with&#xD;
           video-conferencing capability.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The effect of episodic treatment of flare-ups with palovarotene on the total burden of&#xD;
           heterotopic ossification (HO) as assessed by low-dose whole body computerized tomography&#xD;
           (WBCT), excluding the head; and whole body dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The effect of episodic treatment of flare-ups with palovarotene on physical function&#xD;
           using age-appropriate forms of the FOP-Physical Function Questionnaire (FOP-PFQ).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The effect of episodic treatment of flare-ups with palovarotene on physical and mental&#xD;
           health using age appropriate forms of the Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement&#xD;
           Information System (PROMIS) Global Health Scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The effects of episodic treatment of flare-ups with palovarotene on pain and swelling&#xD;
           associated with the flare-up using numeric rating scales (NRS) or the Faces Pain&#xD;
           Scale-Revised (FPS-R) in subjects under 8 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The use of assistive devices and adaptations for daily living by FOP subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The follow-up portion of the study will consist of a Screening visit that will correspond to&#xD;
      the last day (Study Day 84) of Study PVO-1A-202 and bi-annual assessments at Months 6, 12,&#xD;
      18, 24, 30, and 36.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects experiencing a new, distinct flare-up during the 36-month follow-up will be&#xD;
      evaluated and if eligible, receive palovarotene at the weight-adjusted equivalent of 10 mg&#xD;
      for 14 days followed by 5 mg for at least 28 days. Any subject who received a lower dosing&#xD;
      regimen due to tolerability issues during Study PVO-1A-202 will receive that tolerated dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For each flare-up there will be two periods:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. A Screening period to occur within 7 days of the start of a new, distinct flare-up. The&#xD;
           first dose of palovarotene will be taken within 10 days of the flare-up onset to allow&#xD;
           for shipment of study medication to the subject's home.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. A treatment period of at least 6 weeks duration. Subjects experiencing a new, distinct&#xD;
           flare-up will be evaluated&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        For study enrollment&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Completed Study PVO-1A-202 having been treated with palovarotene (ie, 6 weeks&#xD;
             on-treatment and 6-weeks follow-up) for two flare-ups.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Written, signed, and dated informed consent or age-appropriate subject/parent assent&#xD;
             (this must be performed according to local regulations).&#xD;
&#xD;
        For treatment with palovarotene for subsequent flare-ups&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Symptomatic onset of a new, distinct flare-up within 10 days of the first dose of&#xD;
             study drug. Symptoms must be reported by the subject, be consistent with their&#xD;
             previous flare-ups, and include a subject-reported onset date. The flare-up must be&#xD;
             confirmed by the physician at screening via telephone contact and/or&#xD;
             video-conferencing.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Females of child-bearing potential (FOCBP) must have a negative blood (or urine)&#xD;
             pregnancy test (with sensitivity of at least 50 mIU/mL) prior to administration of&#xD;

TEAEs were adverse events reported during treatment with palovarotene or within 6 weeks after the end of treatment. Day 1 was the first day that study drug was administered for a flare-up. The number of subjects experiencing at least one TEAE or treatment-emergent SAE are presented.</description>

If treatment was extended beyond 6 weeks (if deemed necessary by the Investigator), the palovarotene dose-equivalent of 5 mg was to be administered (in 2-week increments) until the flare-up resolved.</description>
