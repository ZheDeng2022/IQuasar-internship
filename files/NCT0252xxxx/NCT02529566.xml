      Investigate the potential of tissue grafting that includes human mesenchymal stem cells in&#xD;
      the repair and potential stabilization of the degenerative Lumbar disk and facet joint denovo&#xD;
      and at the time of surgical reconstruction. Our hypothesis proposes that stabilization will&#xD;
      help restore normal structure and function in the degenerative lumbar spine may decrease&#xD;
      chronic low back pain associated with the biomechanical demise of the degenerative disk or&#xD;
      facet and may improve the natural history of adjacent segment disease found after spinal&#xD;
      surgery.&#xD;

      This study is a prospective cohort clinical study, of tissue grafts containing nucleated&#xD;
      adult derived autologous or allograft mesenchymal stem cells delivered via intra-discal or&#xD;
      intra-facet injections in subjects with chronic low back pain due to either lumbar&#xD;
      degenerative disk disease or degenerative facet disease at one to five lumbar levels from L1&#xD;
      to S1 in patients who have been unresponsive to conservative therapy. A second cohort&#xD;
      evaluating the development of adjacent segment disease in the lumbar disk and facet joints&#xD;
      after nucleated adult mesenchymal stem cells are delivered via intra-discal or intra-facet&#xD;
      injections during surgical treatment of adjacent levels for degenerative pathology in the&#xD;
      spine. Traditionally, treatment of degenerative spinal conditions has focused on the&#xD;
      reconstruction of damaged tissues within the motion segments of the spine. However, biologic&#xD;
      treatment of degenerated spinal components should address the etiology of the disease process&#xD;
      as opposed to reacting to symptomatology. Strategies to induce a reparative response within&#xD;
      the disk and facet joint focus on rebuilding the chondrocyte population and inducing their&#xD;
      production of healthy biomechanical extracellular matrix.. Current models to induce a&#xD;
      reparative response include; injection of proteins to stimulate proteoglycan production or&#xD;
      inhibit the inflammatory response; transfer of genetic material to cells within the dammed&#xD;
      structures; engineering of newly formed tissues ex-vivo for implantation; and finally&#xD;
      repopulation of the damaged tissues with cells that can repair the injured structures.&#xD;
      Subjects who meet strict inclusion/exclusion criteria will be enrolled in the study for&#xD;
      injection of allograft or autologous tissue grafting that includes mesenchymal stem cells&#xD;
      into their degenerative lumbar spine and followed for a minimum of 2 years for efficacy and&#xD;
      adverse events. This is a prospective clinical study cohort comparing allograft to autograft&#xD;
      cellular tissue graft injections in subjects with chronic low back pain due to either lumbar&#xD;
      degenerative disk disease or degenerative facet disease at one to five lumbar levels from L1&#xD;
      to S1 in patients who have been unresponsive to conservative therapy for at least 3&#xD;
      months.Pre-treatment imaging criteria including Pfirmann Lumbar disk Scores and/or Fujiwara&#xD;
      Facet Joint Scores will be noted during the screening visits. After the screening and&#xD;
      treatment visits, each subject will be evaluated at 2 weeks, 6 weeks, and again at 3, 6, 12,&#xD;
      24 months after injection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MRI scanning will be performed at the 6 month post-procedure visit and Pfirmann or Fujiwara&#xD;
      Scores will be calculated along with notation of adjacent level disease, epidural pathology&#xD;
      (i.e. new disk herniations), or new imaging findings. Patients will be given informed consent&#xD;
      to participate the individual treatment they are to receive. This informed consent will&#xD;
      follow US FDA guidelines detailed in ICH E6 Section 4.8 of the US Department of Health and&#xD;
      Human Services Center for Drug/Biologics Evaluation and Research. At completion of enrollment&#xD;
      patients will have surgical sterile preparation and draping. All JCAHO Surgical Care&#xD;
      Improvement Project protocols including pre-operative antibiotics will be adhered to. The&#xD;
      disk or facet joint of interest will be verified by fluoroscopy and will be sterilely&#xD;
      cannulated with an 21 to 11G needle based on anatomic requirements. At this point injection&#xD;
      of FDA approved allograft or autograft mesenchymal stem cells within a demineralized bone&#xD;
      matrix or hyalouronic acid carrier respectively will be injected in to the facet joint or&#xD;
      disk space. Needle will be removed and sterile dressing will be placed. Patients will be&#xD;
      placed in a post operative brace for stabilization of the index level to aid in healing.&#xD;
      Patients will be discharged home once standard outpatient discharge criteria are met per&#xD;
      JCAHO guidelines. Follow up periods will be adhered to as noted above. Patient safety will be&#xD;
      strictly monitored in the pre-procedure, peri-procedure, and post-procedure periods for a&#xD;
      minimum of 2 years. All patients will be assigned to a follow up surgeon at specific follow&#xD;
      up periods and no patients will be denied any care during that period. Physical examination&#xD;
      will be documented at each visit. Additionally, scheduled imaging studies will be performed&#xD;
      throughout the study period to follow safety. Patients will be followed by their surgical&#xD;
      investigator, who will be responsible for diagnosis and management of any complications or&#xD;
      adverse events. Development of additional non-spinal disease processes will also be&#xD;
      documented to follow any trends that occur including any new related or un-related diseases.&#xD;
      Safety of patient confidentiality is an additional study related risk, which will be&#xD;
      optimized to the fullest by adhering to the US Health Insurance Portability and&#xD;
      Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA). Any Serious Adverse Events (SAE) as defined by the US FDA&#xD;
      will be reported immediately to the IRB for evaluation. A SAE is classified as an adverse&#xD;
      event that results in hospital admission or hospital stay, or alteration of the body in a&#xD;
      permanent way. Surgeon investigators will provide pre-operative, peri-operative, and&#xD;
      post-operative care for all subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pre-operative, peri-operative, and post operative data will be collected. Patients will be&#xD;
      followed for a minimum of 2 years within the US or Canada with a study investigator for data&#xD;
      collection at 2 weeks (±1 wk), 6 weeks (±2 wks), and 3 months (±2 wks), 6 months (±1 mo), 9&#xD;
      months (± 1.5 months), 12 months (±2 mos), and 24 months (±2 mos). Data may be entered as at&#xD;
      additional time points as needed. Re-admission, re-injection, and additional&#xD;
      hospital/outpatient events will be collected including possible additional surgical&#xD;
      procedures. Data will be managed by the investigator or their designee in a computerized&#xD;
      database accessible only by research staff with original information kept with the patient&#xD;
      medical record in the hospital or follow up sub-investigator office. Comparative statistical&#xD;
      analysis will be performed prior to any publication to validate data and conclusions. Study&#xD;
      staff and the Principle Investigator (PI) agree to conduct the study(ies) in accordance with&#xD;
      the relevant, current protocol(s) and will only make changes in a protocol after notifying&#xD;
      the sponsor, except when necessary to protect the safety, rights, or welfare of subjects. The&#xD;
      PI agrees to personally conduct or supervise the described investigation(s). The PI agrees to&#xD;
      inform any patients, or any persons used as controls, when drugs or devices are being used&#xD;
      for investigational purposes and the PI will ensure that the requirements relating to&#xD;
      obtaining informed consent in US 21 CFR Part 50 and institutional review board (IRB) review&#xD;
      and approval in US 21 CFR Part 56 are met. The PI agrees to report to the sponsor adverse&#xD;
      experiences that occur in the course of the investigation(s) in accordance with US 21 CFR&#xD;
      312.64. The PI understands the potential risks and side effects of all treatments,&#xD;
      investigational and standard of care. The PI agrees to ensure that all associates,&#xD;
      colleagues, and employees assisting in the conduct of the study(ies) are informed about their&#xD;
      obligations in meeting the above commitments. The PI agrees to maintain adequate and accurate&#xD;
      records in accordance with US 21 CFR 312.62 and to make those records available for&#xD;
      inspection in accordance with US 21 CFR 312.68 if the study is applied and accepted for US&#xD;
      FDA review. The PI will ensure that the IRB complies with the requirements of US 21 CFR Part&#xD;
      56 will be responsible for the initial and continuing review and approval of the clinical&#xD;
      investigation. The PI also agrees to promptly report to the IRB all changes in the research&#xD;
      activity and all unanticipated problems involving risks to human subjects or others.&#xD;
      Additionally, the PI will not make any changes in the research without IRB approval, except&#xD;
      where necessary to eliminate apparent immediate hazards to human subjects. The PI agrees to&#xD;
      comply with all other requirements regarding the obligations of clinical investigators and&#xD;
      all other pertinent requirements in US 21 CFR Part 312. Medical Ethics are of primary&#xD;
      importance during a study of that exposes humans to a new treatment. The scientific merit of&#xD;
      the study protocol, potential social value of the research, skill and experience of the&#xD;
      investigators, and potential financial exploitation of the study subjects are all of&#xD;
      paramount concern. Thus, in addition to abiding by the US FDA Quality Assurance Policy (Form&#xD;
      1572), the World Health Organization's &quot;Declaration of Helsinki&quot; involving the Ethical&#xD;
      Principles for Medical Research Involving Human Subjects will be abided by throughout the&#xD;
      trial. Finally, as this study involves subjects that reside within the United States, the&#xD;
      investigators in this trial will also abide by Title 45 Part 46 of the Code of [US] Federal&#xD;
      Regulations, Protection of Human Subjects (45 CFR 46).&#xD;
