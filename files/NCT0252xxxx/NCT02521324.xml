  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The current study is designed to evaluate the effect of device guided breathing (DGB) on&#xD;
      sleeplessness. Healthy subjects with mild to moderate sleeplessness that wish to improve&#xD;
      their sleep quality will be included in this study. The subjects will receive a belt type&#xD;
      breathing sensor, download the app on their smartphone, and will be required to perform DGB&#xD;
      at their home setting for 2 weeks after a baseline period.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Sleeplessness, defined as difficulty in falling asleep or maintaining sleep, is prevalent in&#xD;
      about one third of the US population. Sleeplessness was found to have negative impact on the&#xD;
      quality of life and daily functionality and in its chronic form, was also found to frequently&#xD;
      lead to sympathetic over-activity. Stress is an important factor in triggering and&#xD;
      exacerbating sleeplessness and its symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Current methods for alleviating the problem include drugs, modification of sleep habits (also&#xD;
      delivered via smartphones), cognitive behavior therapy that includes relaxation techniques&#xD;
      such as mindfulness, meditation, and diaphragmatic breathing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Breathing pattern modification, as done by Device Guided Breathing (DGB) was found to affect&#xD;
      beneficially the cardiovascular system. DGB guides its user in reducing breathing rate&#xD;
      gradually from normal values (12-20 breaths/min) to slow rates (4-6 breaths/min) while&#xD;
      increasing the relative duration of the exhalation phase. This is done by composing in real&#xD;
      time musical tones from monitored respiration data with which the user synchronizes breathing&#xD;
&#xD;
      Breathing pattern modification, as done by DGB was originally implemented in a device called&#xD;
      RESPeRATE that was cleared by the FDA for treating hypertension and stress and its use was&#xD;
      supported by multiple clinical trials. However, the direct effect of DGB on sleeplessness has&#xD;
      not yet been investigated,&#xD;
&#xD;
      DGB was recently implemented in a mobile system that consists of a Bluetooth enabled&#xD;
      belt-type breathing sensor and an iOS mobile application ('App'). The App accumulates&#xD;
      continuously breathing-related data and performance measure. The accumulated data are sent to&#xD;
      an icloud-based server.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The current study is a single center, prospective, randomized, waiting-list-controlled (WLC)&#xD;
      clinical trial designed to evaluate the effect of DGB on sleeplessness using the mobile DGB2&#xD;
      system.&#xD;
