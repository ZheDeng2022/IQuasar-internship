      This is an electrogram mapping study that tests the ability of a new signal processing&#xD;
      technique called electrogram morphology recurrence mapping to locate drivers in participants&#xD;
      with atrial fibrillation. This study will also test the hypothesis that there are&#xD;
      non-invasive markers that can predict driver location. Electrogram mapping will be performed&#xD;
      in participants undergoing ablation for persistent atrial fibrillation. These participants&#xD;
      will have a cardiac MRI and 12-lead ECG prior to the ablation procedure.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Atrial fibrillation (AF) has been described as a new emerging epidemic currently affecting&#xD;
      around 1% of the population. Risk of AF increases with age and as the elderly continue to&#xD;
      comprise a larger percentage of the population in the United States, the health burden of AF&#xD;
      continues to increase. Some estimates project nearly 16 million cases of AF in the US alone&#xD;
      by 2050. The economic burden of AF has been estimated to be between $6-26 billion. AF is a&#xD;
      significant risk factor for stroke if left untreated as well as mortality. The diagnosis and&#xD;
      treatment of AF have therefore become an important aspect of cardiovascular medicine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Current pharmacological treatments for AF have modest efficacy and suffer from potentially&#xD;
      life-threatening side effects. Current ablative and surgical approaches to AF, though&#xD;
      somewhat more successful, use an anatomic, 'one-size fits all' strategy (with some minor&#xD;
      variations) that does not address the specific mechanisms underlying this complex arrhythmia.&#xD;
      The pulmonary veins have been shown to be a common location of AF triggers. Thus, the most&#xD;
      common approach for catheter ablation involves the isolation of the pulmonary veins, such as&#xD;
      the wide area circumferential pulmonary vein ablation strategy. The lack of consideration of&#xD;
      specific sources may be, at least in part, responsible for post- ablation arrhythmias&#xD;
      occurring in up to 40% of patients who undergo pulmonary vein ablation. However, while&#xD;
      ablation/surgical success has been shown to increase with more extensive ablation/surgery in&#xD;
      the atria, the latter comes at the cost of significant &quot;collateral damage&quot; to the atrial&#xD;
      myocardium as well as to surrounding structures, with an accompanying increase in the risk of&#xD;
      complications and a decrease in atrial function. The time and cost to perform these&#xD;
      procedures is also significant. Thus, catheter and surgical ablation strategies tailored to&#xD;
      the specific arrhythmia origin of a patient's AF would have a significant impact on the&#xD;
      ability to treat this arrhythmia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigator's laboratory has developed a novel electrogram morphology recurrence&#xD;
      analysis to observe the nonlinear dynamics of AF activation. This technique to map AF&#xD;
      activation is based on the hypothesis that AF electrograms with morphologies that are highly&#xD;
      recurrent and that have short cycle lengths represent the locations of stable AF sources. The&#xD;
      investigator's preliminary data show that when the highest recurrence percentage or shortest&#xD;
      recurrence cycle length occurs in the left atrium in patients undergoing pulmonary vein-based&#xD;
      ablation, the patients has a much higher chance to stay in sinus rhythm post-ablation than&#xD;
      when the highest recurrence percentage or shortest recurrence cycle length occur in the right&#xD;
      atrium. Cycle length of all activations was not a predictor of outcomes. High resolution&#xD;
      electrical mapping of AF in the canine atria showed that the shortest recurrence cycle length&#xD;
      sites correspond to areas containing rotors. Thus, these preliminary data provide strong&#xD;
      evidence that morphology recurrence mapping is able to identify the locations of AF sources.&#xD;
