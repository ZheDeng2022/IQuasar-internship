      1. Purpose and objective: Determine spectroscopic differences between tumor, dysplasia, and&#xD;
           normal cutaneous tissue as assessed by histopathologic diagnosis. If successful, the&#xD;
           optical measurements could be used to survey for and delineate the extent of&#xD;
           malignancies in a noninvasive manner.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Study activities and population group: Competent adults with a clinically suspicious&#xD;
           skin lesion who are undergoing a biopsy as part of their routine care. For those who&#xD;
           agree to participate, the sterilized portable optical spectroscopic probe will be used&#xD;
           to measure diffuse reflectance on the lesion of clinical interest.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Data analysis and risk/safety issues: The optical spectrometer does not breach any skin&#xD;
           defense barrier. As this study involves noninvasive optical measurements of tissues, no&#xD;
           significant safety concerns are anticipated. Qualitative analysis will be performed to&#xD;
           describe whether there is correlation between spectroscopy measurements and pathologic&#xD;
           diagnosis. A variety of correlative statistics will be explored to determine if there&#xD;
           are relationships found that can justify a larger study&#xD;

      This is a pilot study to determine the optical spectroscopy characteristics of tumor in&#xD;
      patients with cutaneous malignancies. These spectroscopy measurements will be compared with&#xD;
      pathological diagnosis of tissue biopsies from the same site. If successful, the optical&#xD;
      measurements could be used to survey for and delineate the extent of malignancies in a&#xD;
      noninvasive manner. This would be especially helpful for clinic visits where suspicious&#xD;
      lesions are seen and would otherwise require biopsy for diagnosis. Immediate benefits would&#xD;
      include patients with numerous suspicious skin lesions who would require multiple biopsies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Further spectroscopy measurements of the tumor site and adjacent normal tissue during therapy&#xD;
      (chemoradiotherapy or radiotherapy) may provide useful information pertinent to tumor&#xD;
      physiology and therapeutic effectiveness.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with at least one clinically suspicious skin lesion warranting a biopsy as&#xD;
             part of routine care, in the outpatient clinic setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with previous histologically confirmed malignancy such as basal cell&#xD;
             carcinoma or squamous cell carcinoma are eligible; however this is not required for&#xD;
             enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The suspicious skin lesion(s) is accessible to optical probe measurements. If patient&#xD;
             has previous histologically confirmed malignancy of the skin, then the primary tumor&#xD;
             site must be accessible to optical probe measurements&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient is able to provide written informed consent&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient is &gt;18 years of age&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  &lt; 18 years of age&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Unable to provide written informed consent&#xD;
