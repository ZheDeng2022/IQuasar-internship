  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The reason for this study is to understand if people with certain genes are predisposed to&#xD;
      develop severe skin reactions after they are administered Eslicarbazepine Acetate. Currently&#xD;
      there is no information that suggests that certain individuals who use Eslicarbazepine&#xD;
      Acetate are predisposed to develop severe skin reactions. However, previous research has&#xD;
      shown that seizure medicines like carbamazepine (Tegretol®) and oxcarbazepine (Trileptal®,&#xD;
      Oxtellar XR®) are more likely to cause severe drug related skin reactions in some people of&#xD;
      Asian ancestry who have specific genes. These are genes found in an area of chromosomes&#xD;
      called the Major Histocompatibility Complex. This association is called a genetic risk&#xD;
      factor. The study objective is to compare information that is obtained from individuals with&#xD;
      a history of seizure disorders who develop severe skin reactions while using Eslicarbazepine&#xD;
      Acetate to a group of patients who also have a history of seizure disorders and do not have a&#xD;
      history of a severe skin reaction after using Eslicarbazepine Acetate.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This study is a genetic case-control study conducted in the United States. In case-control&#xD;
      studies, cases with a condition of interest (in this case, individuals with SCAR [severe&#xD;
      cutaneous adverse reactions] after initiating ESL); and controls, individuals known to not&#xD;
      have the condition of interest (in this case ESL users without SCAR), are identified. Cases&#xD;
      will be individuals with documented definite or probable Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS),&#xD;
      toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis (AGEP), drug&#xD;
      reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) or symptom onset consistent with one&#xD;
      of these conditions within the first 4 months of using ESL (including up to 14 days after&#xD;
      discontinuing ESL), ascertained through PPD Pharmacovigilance (PVG) (Sponsor CRO). Controls&#xD;
      will be individuals who have used ESL for at least 6 weeks but did not develop any SCAR and&#xD;
      will be matched by genetic ancestry classification in a ratio of up to 10 controls per case.&#xD;
      Controls will be collected prospectively, so that a pool of ESL-tolerant patients will be&#xD;
      identified independently of the collection of cases. Controls will be selected from among:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Ongoing subjects in clinical studies of ESL; and&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients prescribed ESL who may be asked to participate by neurologists at&#xD;
           high-prescribing practices with high ethnic diversity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood or saliva samples for genotyping ancestry markers (for matching controls to cases) and&#xD;
      sequencing the HLA regions will be collected from cases and control subjects after they have&#xD;
      provided consent for participation in a genetic study. In addition, a blood sample will be&#xD;
      requested from subjects to assess the relationship with specific viral markers.&#xD;
