  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The best treatment plan for Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis (JIA) is often complicated.&#xD;
      Patients and clinicians often don't know what is the best treatment strategy for a given&#xD;
      patient at a given time. The purpose of this study is to develop a method to analyze data in&#xD;
      situations where the treatment and disease state change over time. The researchers will&#xD;
      develop a web-based package that will use the methods developed in this study. The package&#xD;
      will be easy to use and allow dissemination of the methods to the public.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      During routine clinical care, patients and physicians are often confronted with the following&#xD;
      questions: &quot;Given my (my child's) responses to the previous treatments, what is the best&#xD;
      treatment option for me (my child)?&quot; (by a patient/parent) and &quot;What treatment should we&#xD;
      recommend to patients who fail to respond to the first (or second) line of treatment?&quot; (by a&#xD;
      physician). Both questions are at the heart of patient centered outcomes research and&#xD;
      clinical care, yet answers to these questions are seriously hindered by the lack of adequate&#xD;
      analytic methods that appropriately take into account the fact that treatments, as well as&#xD;
      the determinants of a treatment decision, vary over time during the course of the disease.&#xD;
      Case in point: despite many medication options, polyarticular Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis&#xD;
      (pJIA) is often refractory, and requires better adaptive treatment strategies (ATS). Three&#xD;
      ATS were recommended by a panel of experts for pJIA patients, but they need adequate analysis&#xD;
      methods to evaluate and identify better ATS using observational data. Motivated by our&#xD;
      patient-centered questions, and rigorously designed to evaluate the clinical effectiveness of&#xD;
      patient centered adaptive treatment strategies (PCATS), the proposed method development will&#xD;
      directly address: &quot;development and dissemination of methods for adequate analysis of data in&#xD;
      cases where the treatment/exposure varies over time&quot;, an area of interest identified by&#xD;
      PCORI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Accomplishing the proposed study will provide much needed double robust Bayesian causal&#xD;
      inference methods that take the challenges of analyzing large registry and electronic health&#xD;
      records including model uncertainty, large dimensional covariates and the unmeasured&#xD;
      confounders, into account. A web-based userfriendly analytic computational package will be&#xD;
      developed to allow easy application of the proposed methods. These developments will: 1)&#xD;
      immediately offer methods and computational tools for evaluating clinical effectiveness and&#xD;
      informing optimal ATS, 2) in the near future, enable shared-decision making tools for&#xD;
      identifying optimal PCATS at the point-of-care, and 3) eventually enable a rapid learning&#xD;
      system that will facilitate optimal PCATS. This study will have an immediate impact to&#xD;
      children and stakeholders of JIA and a long-term broad impact to many chronically ill&#xD;
      patients. Successful completion of this project will significantly move PCORI closer to its&#xD;
      mission of helping &quot;people make better informed healthcare decisions and improve healthcare&#xD;
      delivery and outcomes&quot;.&#xD;
