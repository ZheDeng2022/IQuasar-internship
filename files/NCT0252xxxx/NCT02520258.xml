      Experiments have shown that some artificial sweeteners like those in diet soda can cause&#xD;
      changes in how the body responds to and uses sugar. These changes increase the chance of&#xD;
      obesity, type 2 diabetes, and other metabolic diseases. In this study, the investigators plan&#xD;
      to see if the most common artificial sweetener, aspartame (brand name Equal, NutraSweet),&#xD;
      causes these changes. The investigators believe that if metabolic changes are observed in a&#xD;
      person who consumes aspartame, then removing all aspartame from the diet might lead to a&#xD;
      reversal of the changes and a normalization of test results.This would impact sweetener&#xD;
      additives in our foods and thus decrease the incidence of obesity, diabetes, and the&#xD;
      metabolic syndrome.&#xD;

      Experiments have shown that some artificial sweeteners like those in diet soda can cause&#xD;
      changes in how the body responds to and uses sugar. These changes increase the chance of&#xD;
      obesity, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and other metabolic diseases. In this study, the&#xD;
      investigators plan to see if the most commonly used artificial sweetener, aspartame, affects&#xD;
      the body's response to sugar. The investigators believe that if metabolic changes are&#xD;
      observed in a person who consumes aspartame, then removing all aspartame from the diet might&#xD;
      lead to a reversal of the changes and a normalization of test results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators plan to study two (2) cohorts of healthy volunteers: 1) Those who regularly&#xD;
      drink at least three cans per day of diet soda that contains aspartame (Cohort 1, Aspartame&#xD;
      Consumers) and 2) participants who consume less than or equal to two (2) cans of diet soda&#xD;
      per week (Cohort 2, Aspartame Naïve Participants).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase I of the study, the investigators will ask participants questions about their usual&#xD;
      diet, including how much diet soda they usually drink. Participants will be screened by a&#xD;
      test called the oral glucose tolerance test, or OGTT. This test involves coming to the&#xD;
      hospital to drink sugary syrup, then have blood sugar checked every thirty (30) minutes for&#xD;
      five (5) hours. Before the test, participants must refrain from eating or drinking anything&#xD;
      for ten (10) hours. If the OGTT shows a high value, then the participant in cohort 1&#xD;
      (Aspartame Consumers) who regularly drink 3 or more cans per day of diet soda will be&#xD;
      approached about continuing into the second phase of the study. For the participants in&#xD;
      cohort 2 (consume less than or equal to two (2) cans of diet soda per week; Aspartame Naïve&#xD;
      Participants), this will be the end of their participation in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase II of the study, blood tests, OGTT, stool samples, and weight and body fat measurements&#xD;
      a few times a week will track any changes in the participants during the study. During the&#xD;
      phase II five (5) week study, participants will receive all of their meals from the&#xD;
      Rockefeller University Hospital and should not have any outside food or drinks. The diet used&#xD;
      throughout this study phase (II) is the Prudent Metabolic Diet. Participants can leave the&#xD;
      hospital and continue to work, but must come for all tests and to receive meals. During Week&#xD;
      One, participants will eat only food provided by the hospital but will continue to drink&#xD;
      three (3) cans of diet soda per day. In Weeks Two through Four, participants will continue to&#xD;
      eat food given to them by the hospital and will not be allowed to consume any foods or drinks&#xD;
      that contain aspartame. In Week Five, participants will continue on the hospital diet, but&#xD;
      will again start drinking three (3) cans of diet soda per day.&#xD;
