  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sabin 2 will be withdrawn from routine use globally from April 2016 as per the SAGE&#xD;
      recommendations at the time of writing this protocol. After this cessation of OPV2,&#xD;
      stockpiles of mOPV2 will be maintained for potential use if necessary in response to a future&#xD;
      outbreak. However, there will be a risk of cVDPV2 from Sabin 2 in settings of low population&#xD;
      immunity. Research is ongoing to develop vaccines that are genetically more stable than the&#xD;
      currently available Sabin 2-containing OPVs. To generate data on immunogenicity, safety, and&#xD;
      genetic stability on the Sabin 2 vaccine (mOPV2) and as a future comparator for new polio&#xD;
      vaccine research after the global switch from tOPV to bOPV, this study with mOPV2 is&#xD;
      performed to evaluate safety, immunogenicity (humoral and intestinal) and genetic stability&#xD;
      endpoints of mOPV2 in children aged 1 to 5 years and in infants approximately 18 weeks of&#xD;
      aged vaccinated with bOPV-/IPV for better understanding of the stockpile use of this vaccine,&#xD;
      and for comparison with any potential new polio vaccine with a type 2 component in the&#xD;
      future.&#xD;

      1. PRIMARY OBJECTIVE The primary objectives of the study are to assess the safety (serious&#xD;
           adverse events [SAEs] and severe adverse events [AEs] grade 3 according to CTCAE 4.03&#xD;
           and immunogenicity (seroprotection rate) of a single dose of SABIN mOPV2 in healthy&#xD;
           children aged 1 to 5 years old, and in infants at approximately 18 weeks of age after&#xD;
           having been vaccinated with 3 doses of bOPV and 1 dose of IPV .&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES&#xD;
&#xD;
           Secondary objectives are to assess:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  The safety (mild and moderate solicited and unsolicited AEs, Important Medical&#xD;
                Events [IMEs], and laboratory deviation assessments) of one or two doses of SABIN&#xD;
                mOPV2 in healthy children aged 1 to 5 years, and of 2 doses of SABIN mOPV2 in&#xD;
                infants at approximately 18 and 22 weeks of age after having been vaccinated with 3&#xD;
                doses of bOPV and 1 dose of IPV.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  The immunogenicity (seroconversion rate, median and geometric mean antibody titers)&#xD;
                of one or two doses of SABIN mOPV2 in healthy children aged 1 to 5 years old, and&#xD;
                of two doses of SABIN mOPV2 in infants at approximately 18 22 weeks of age after&#xD;
                having been vaccinated with 3 doses of bOPV and 1 dose of IPV.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exploratory objectives are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To investigate viral shedding following the SABIN mOPV2 administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Exploratory objectives may also include assessment of the genetic sequence heterogeneity&#xD;
           and potential for neurovirulence (as measured in animal model(s)) of shed virus.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To investigate viral shedding and neurovirulence of shed virus;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate genetic reversion at position nt481 (primarily) and other secondary sites&#xD;
           (e.g., nt2908).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To investigate the priming responses of bOPV for mOPV2. (group 2 only) and the duration&#xD;
           of induction of anti-polio type 2 neutralizing antibodies .&#xD;
