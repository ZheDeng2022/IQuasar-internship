      The purpose of this study is to determine whether weekly SMS reminders are effective in&#xD;
      improving medication adherence of adjuvant aromatase inhibitors in women with breast cancer.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is a prospective randomised controlled parallel trial of SMS reminder versus&#xD;
      standard care to investigate whether SMS reminder improves adherence to oral aromatase&#xD;
      inhibitor (AI) therapy amongst women with breast cancer at 1-year follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All subjects will be randomised to receive either SMS reminder or standard care in a 1:1&#xD;
      ratio. Balanced permuted block randomisation will be implemented with random varying of block&#xD;
      sizes of 4 or 6.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sample size is estimated based on the primary endpoint of medication adherence (as&#xD;
      measured via SMAQ) at 1-year. Assuming that the proportion of medication adherence in the&#xD;
      intervention and control groups are 80% and 60% respectively, then based on a 5% significance&#xD;
      level and a power of 90%, a minimum sample of 240 subjects (i.e. 120 per group) will be&#xD;
      required. Further assuming an attrition rate of 10%, the anticipated trial size is 280&#xD;
      overall.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The assessment of medication adherence at 1-year (as measured via SMAQ) between the SMS&#xD;
      reminder and control groups will be made using chi-square test. Adjustment for baseline&#xD;
      covariate and potential confounders will be made using the logistic regression where&#xD;
      appropriate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Other measures of adherence such as the 1-year MPR, PDC and pill count will be compared&#xD;
      between treatment arms via the t- test, with adjustment for confounders made via the analysis&#xD;
      of covariance (ANCOVA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Natural log transformation will be implemented on the estrone and androstenedione measures to&#xD;
      normalise the data. The assessment of secondary outcomes involving the log transformed&#xD;
      estrone and androstenedione levels will be made using the analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) to&#xD;
      adjust for the respective baseline levels and other potential confounders. Comparison of&#xD;
      estradiol levels (defined as &lt;18.4 versus â‰¥18.4) between the two arms will be made using&#xD;
      chi-square test. The logistic regression analysis will be implemented to adjust for baseline&#xD;
      covariate and other potential confounders where appropriate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The assessment of knowledge, attitude, behavior, as well as barrier and facilitating factors&#xD;
      between the intervention and control groups will be made using chi-square test, with&#xD;
      treatment effect quantified based on odds ratio estimate and its 95% CI. Further adjustment&#xD;
      for baseline scores and other potential confounders will be made using the logistic&#xD;
      regression where appropriate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additionally, the investigators will compare the 4 different measures of adherence in a&#xD;
      separate paper, to determine which of these provide a more meaningful or reliable information&#xD;
      in the local context based on sensitivity analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All analyses will be performed according to intention-to-treat using STATA, assuming a&#xD;
      two-sided test at the 5% level of significance.&#xD;
