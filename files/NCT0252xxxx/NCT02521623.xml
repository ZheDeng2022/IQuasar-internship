      An increasing number of women undergo an immediate breast reconstruction, where the&#xD;
      mastectomy and the breast reconstruction are performed in the same surgery. To aid survival&#xD;
      of the mastectomy skin flaps, and to provide better aesthetic results acellular dermal&#xD;
      matrixes (ADMs) are used to reinforce the breast. There are several different types of ADM&#xD;
      available for this purpose. In this randomized clinical trial, the following study will&#xD;
      investigate two different types of ADM (Strattice™ and SurgiMend®) in an immediate breast&#xD;
      reconstructive setting. Sixty patients will be allocated on a 1:1 ratio to receive either&#xD;
      Strattice™ or SurgiMend® ADM. Patients scheduled for immediate breast reconstruction with ADM&#xD;
      at pt. of Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery at Aarhus University Hospital, Aarhus, Denmark&#xD;
      will be offered participation. In total, 60 patients will be included. Outcome parameters of&#xD;
      interest are complication rate, patient satisfaction, aesthetic result and cost of the&#xD;
      procedure. Satisfaction and aesthetic result will be measured at 4 and 12 months post&#xD;
      surgery.&#xD;

      Introduction&#xD;
&#xD;
      An increasing number of Danish women undergo genetic counseling for hereditary breast cancer.&#xD;
      If the patient´s lifetime risk is evaluated to be more than 30%, the patient may choose to&#xD;
      undergo a risk-reducing mastectomy (prophylactic mastectomy) to reduce the risk of developing&#xD;
      breast cancer. The mastectomy is mostly performed as a skin-sparing procedure, where only the&#xD;
      nipple area and the breast tissue is removed leaving the skin envelope intact, in order to&#xD;
      preserve the breast skin for an immediate breast reconstruction. In select cases the surgery&#xD;
      may be performed as a nipple-sparing procedure. Additionally, there is an increasing group of&#xD;
      women diagnosed with multifocal DCIS who choose risk-reducing mastectomy with an immediate&#xD;
      reconstruction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order for the risk-reducing mastectomy to be effective, it is of utmost importance that&#xD;
      all the breast tissue is removed. This leaves the skin flaps covering the breast thin and&#xD;
      vulnerable to necrosis, if not handled with utmost care. In order to spare the mastectomy&#xD;
      skin flaps of some of the strain and pressure caused by the breast implants, acellular dermal&#xD;
      matrixes (ADM) are increasingly used in this type of procedures. ADMs are derived from the&#xD;
      skin of humans or animals, processed to an extent where their cellular components are&#xD;
      completely removed, leaving only the extracellular scaffold, thus not inciting an immune&#xD;
      response from the host. The ADM thus provides a scaffold, promoting integration of the&#xD;
      patient's own connective tissue. In time the ADM will be repopulated and revascularized by&#xD;
      the patient's own cells, essentially becoming an integrated part of the patients body. The&#xD;
      ADM provides optimal definition of the breast borders, essentially allowing improved implant&#xD;
      positioning as compared with a sub muscular coverage technique. If the circumstance of the&#xD;
      breast reconstructions necessitates the placement of an expander implant, use of ADMs allows&#xD;
      for a greater intraoperative expansion, and thus subsequently reduces the number of times the&#xD;
      patients must attend the outpatient's clinic for expansion of the implant. Thus leading to a&#xD;
      shorter time before the expander implant may be exchanged for a permanent implant.&#xD;
      Furthermore, several studies have shown that use of ADM lowers the overall complication rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several types of ADM are used in a breast reconstructive setting around the world. Strattice™&#xD;
      is a porcine derived ADM, and has been available in Europe and Denmark since late 2008. In&#xD;
      order to find the best available ADM for use in a immediate breast reconstructive setting,&#xD;
      both in terms of complication rates and patient satisfaction, it is crucial that new products&#xD;
      are continuously evaluated. SurgiMend®, another type of ADM, was recently introduced on the&#xD;
      Danish market. SurgiMend® ADM is derived from fetal bovine dermis, and recent studies show&#xD;
      that the use of SurgiMend® ADM is associated with a low early complication rate. Furthermore,&#xD;
      a recent study provided evidence that ADM derived from bovine have a higher mechanical stress&#xD;
      tolerance when compared to porcine derived ADM at equivalent thickness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the present study is to evaluate two types of ADM´s in an immediate breast&#xD;
      reconstructive setting. The data from this study will possibly help to minimize complications&#xD;
      and increase patient satisfaction by finding the optimal ADM for immediate breast&#xD;
      reconstructions, thereby contributing to a faster recovery for women who undergo mastectomy&#xD;
      and immediate breast reconstruction with implant and ADM.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis&#xD;
&#xD;
      SurgiMend and Strattice™ provide equal results in regards to complication rates, patient&#xD;
      reported outcome measures and aesthetic appearance in patients undergoing immediate breast&#xD;
      reconstruction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      The project is conducted as a prospective randomized trial. Patients included in the study&#xD;
      will be randomized to receive either Strattice™ or SurgiMend® ADM. Patients are allocated in&#xD;
      a 1:1 ratio, with 30 patients receiving Strattice™ ADM and 30 patients receiving SurgiMend®&#xD;
      ADM. The randomization is performed using a permuted block randomization. Randomization is&#xD;
      blinded for the patients and the outcome assessor. Regardless of which type of ADM the&#xD;
      patient is randomized to receive, the surgical procedure will be performed in the same way.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients included in the study will be asked to complete the BREAST-Q pre-reconstruction&#xD;
      module before their breast reconstruction, and the BREAST-Q post-reconstruction module at 4&#xD;
      and 12 months after their breast reconstruction. The BREAST-Q is a patient reported outcome&#xD;
      measure tool specifically designed and validated for use in breast reconstruction patients.&#xD;
      The BREAST-Q modules consists of several scales, investigating the patients body image,&#xD;
      satisfaction with breasts and satisfaction with care. The BREAST-Q modules are widely used&#xD;
      and have been officially translated into the Danish language.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participating patients will attend the same standard post-operative controls at 4 and 12&#xD;
      months after their breast reconstruction as non-participating patients undergoing immediate&#xD;
      breast reconstruction. In addition to being examined by their operating surgeon at these&#xD;
      controls, the patients' aesthetic result will be evaluated by one of the investigators using&#xD;
      a breast reconstruction outcome scale, previously developed at Dept. of Plastic and&#xD;
      Reconstructive Surgery, Aarhus University Hospital, Aarhus, Denmark. The scale consists of&#xD;
      six questions evaluating the symmetry, feel, and aesthetic appearance of the reconstructed&#xD;
      breasts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment of participants&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients seeking an immediate breast reconstruction are routinely seen in the Dept. of&#xD;
      Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery patient clinic by both a consultant breast surgeon and a&#xD;
      consultant plastic surgeon at the same time. If the breast and plastic surgeon deems the&#xD;
      patient eligible for a primary breast reconstruction and the plastic surgeon evaluates the&#xD;
      patient to be best suited with a breast reconstruction based on an implant and ADM, the&#xD;
      patient will be offered a consultation with the clinical investigator for the project. If the&#xD;
      plastic surgeon believes that a patient is a better candidate for another type of breast&#xD;
      reconstructive procedure than implant and ADM, the patient will not be offered participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the consultation with the investigator, or a well-instructed colleague, the patient will&#xD;
      be given oral and written information about the research project. The patient will always be&#xD;
      offered a period of at least 24 hours before deciding to give consent, but may also give her&#xD;
      informed consent on site. Furthermore, the patient will be offered a second consultation,&#xD;
      where the information about the project will be repeated and any questions regarding the&#xD;
      research project she may have will be answered. The patient will also be encouraged to bring&#xD;
      a family member or friend to the second meeting. The patient may at any time and without need&#xD;
      of justification withdraw consent to participate, without affecting the present and/or future&#xD;
      treatment of the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Risks, side effects and disadvantages&#xD;
&#xD;
      As with all surgery, there is a risk of wound infection, blood clots and altered sensation in&#xD;
      the operated area. This can lead to antibiotic treatment, or where appropriate, a second&#xD;
      operation to stop bleeding or remove damaged tissue. These risks are, however, associated&#xD;
      with the breast reconstruction itself, and not associated with participating in the current&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both types of ADM are well described in the medical literature, and both types of ADM have&#xD;
      achieved good results compared to not using ADM in immediate breast reconstructions. The&#xD;
      risks for the patients choosing to participate in the project are thus solely related to the&#xD;
      breast reconstruction itself, and not to the participation in the current study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participating patients will have to spend approximately 10 minutes completing a questionnaire&#xD;
      before the breast reconstruction. Additionally, the participating patients will be asked to&#xD;
      complete another questionnaire (approximately 10 min) at 4 and 12 months after their breast&#xD;
      reconstruction, as well as participate in an extra clinical examination at their routine&#xD;
      follow-up examinations after 4 and 12 months. The extra examinations at the routine follow-up&#xD;
      visits are expected to take approximately 15 min. per visit. While the questionnaire and the&#xD;
      clinical follow-up may consume some of the patient's time, there are no risks associated with&#xD;
      them.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethical considerations&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is expected that the number of women who choose an immediate breast reconstruction&#xD;
      procedure will increase. Conducting studies that help bring down the complication rates for&#xD;
      these types of surgery is of utmost importance, both for the individual patient undergoing&#xD;
      the surgery and in a socio-economic setting.The proposed study will aid in finding the&#xD;
      optimal method, both in terms of complication rate and patient reported outcome. All of the&#xD;
      patients invited to participate in this study has been evaluated by experienced breast and&#xD;
      plastic surgeons to be best suited with an immediate breast reconstruction with implant and&#xD;
      ADM. The two types of ADMs evaluated in the study have shown good results in previous&#xD;
      studies. As it is not expected that one of the tested ADMs is significantly better than the&#xD;
      other, there is no predictable benefit for the individual patient in regards to participating&#xD;
      in the study.&#xD;
