  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this research study is to learn how easy participants think it is to complete a&#xD;
      symptom questionnaire.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      If participant agrees to take part in the study, basic information about them will be&#xD;
      collected from their medical record (such as their age, gender, ethnicity, religion,&#xD;
      diagnosis, marital status, educational level, performance status, and any drugs they may have&#xD;
      taken in the past or are currently taking).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participant will also be given a list of words and asked to read them out loud. The research&#xD;
      nurse or assistant will write down if participant pronounced the words correctly. This should&#xD;
      take up to 7 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participant will then be randomly assigned (as in the flip of a coin) to 1 of 2 study groups.&#xD;
      This is done because no one knows if one study group is better, the same, or worse than the&#xD;
      other group.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If participant is enrolled in Group 1, they will complete the symptom questionnaire&#xD;
           alone and then a research nurse or assistant will go over their answers with them.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If participant is enrolled in Group 2, they will complete the symptom questionnaire with&#xD;
           the help of the research nurse or assistant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After participant has completed the symptom questionnaire, they will be asked if they&#xD;
      preferred completing the questionnaire alone or if they preferred to have a nurse help them&#xD;
      answer the questions. This should take about 1 minute to answer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Length of Study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      It should take about 15 minutes total to complete the study. Patient's participation on this&#xD;
      study will end after they have completed the symptom questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additional Information:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participant is taking part in this study alone. Participant's family members will not be in&#xD;
      the room with them.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an investigational study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 128 participants will be enrolled in the study. All will take part at MD Anderson.&#xD;
