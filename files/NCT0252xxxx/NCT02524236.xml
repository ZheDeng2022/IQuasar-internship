  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to compare the efficacy and safety of a single&#xD;
      injection of 50 U and 100 U doses of BoNT-A for the treatment of BPH-associated LUTS.&#xD;

      Patients and method:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Men with symptomatic BPH will be invited to participate in this prospective study. Inclusion&#xD;
      criteria will be an age of above 50 years, persistent moderate to severe LUTS as determined&#xD;
      by International Prostatic Symptom Score (IPSS) &gt;8, peak urinary flow rate of less than 12&#xD;
      mL/s, and an enlarged prostate gland on digital rectal examination. Exclusion criteria will&#xD;
      be history of previous surgery for BPH, presence of urethral stenosis, urinary tract&#xD;
      infection, prostate or bladder cancer, history of pelvic surgery or radiotherapy,&#xD;
      neurological diseases, urinary retention and BPH-associated complications requiring surgical&#xD;
      treatment including bladder stone, and bilateral hydronephrosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will undergo further evaluation before treatment, including urine analysis, serum&#xD;
      creatinine, prostate-specific antigen (PSA), Trans rectal prostatic and Trans abdominal&#xD;
      urinary tract sonography, uroflowmetry, and measurement of post-void residual volume (PVR)&#xD;
      via abdominal ultrasonography.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Just before the injection procedure, patients will be randomized to receive either 50 U or&#xD;
      100 U of BoNT-A.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Intervention All patients submitted for intervention will receive oral antibiotics (oral&#xD;
           levofloxacin and flagyl 500 mg) 2 days before injection. Patients will be instructed to&#xD;
           avoid taking anticoagulants, such as aspirin, for at least seven days prior to the&#xD;
           procedure. An enema will be done two to four hours before the ultrasound to clean out&#xD;
           the bowel.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Injection procedure: With the patient lying in lateral position, local anesthesia is&#xD;
      performed with 20 mL of lidocaine 2% solution injected transrectally via transrectal&#xD;
      ultrasound then wait for 10-minutes. The two different BoNT-A doses (50 U or 100 U) will be&#xD;
      reconstituted with saline 0.9% to a total volume of 5 ml. All patients will receive five&#xD;
      injections of 1 mL of the BoNT-A solution, including two injections in each lateral lobe (one&#xD;
      proximal and one distal) and one injection in the median lobe. The injection depth will be&#xD;
      7-10 mm. After the procedure, patients will remain under observation until they are able to&#xD;
      void spontaneously without hematuria. Oral levofloxacin (500 mg once a day) will be&#xD;
      administered for five days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow up:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evaluation will be performed one week, 3 and 6 months after treatment. They will include a&#xD;
      clinical assessment of LUTS with the IPSS score as well as measurement of peak urinary flow&#xD;
      rate and post void residual volume. Serum PSA level and prostate volume will be assessed at&#xD;
      the 6th month. The primary endpoint is improvement of IPSS scores (at least 30% improvement&#xD;
      from baseline to 3 months IPSS and/or maximum urinary flow rate) and safety. The study will&#xD;
      be stopped if 1) a life threatening, disabling or fatal event related to the BONT-A injection&#xD;
      occurred, or 2) 40% or more of the participants report a moderate or severe side effect&#xD;
      related to the botulinum toxin injection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After 3 months, patients showing no improvement within 50 u group will be reinjected another&#xD;
      dose of 100 u and then reevaluated after 3 months of reinjection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will be expressed as means with standard deviations (SD) and range or absolute values&#xD;
      and fractions. Intergroup changes from baseline of continuous variables will be analyzed with&#xD;
      analysis of variance for repeated measurements. Intragroup comparisons will be performed&#xD;
      using the Student's paired t-test. Fisher's test is used for categorical variables. A sample&#xD;
      size of 17 in each group has 80% power to detect a difference between means of 3.00 (units in&#xD;
      the IPSS score), at a two-tailed significance level of 0.05 or less.&#xD;
