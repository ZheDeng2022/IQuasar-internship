  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Although there is evidence for reducing complication rate and improving recovery after the&#xD;
      implementation of Enhanced Recovery After Surgery (ERAS) protocols into colorectal surgery,&#xD;
      most published papers include patients undergoing open resections. The aim was to analyse&#xD;
      factors affecting recovery and length of stay (LOS) in patients after laparoscopic colorectal&#xD;
      surgery for cancer combined with ERAS protocol.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All patients were operated using laparoscopic surgery, and the perioperative care was based&#xD;
      on pre-established ERAS protocol consisting of 13 pre and intraoperative items. Its&#xD;
      principles and criteria for discharge from the hospital were based on the ERAS Society&#xD;
      Guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators analysed which of the factors: gender; age; BMI; ASA (American Society of&#xD;
      Anaesthesiologists) physical status; type of surgery (colonic resection vs. rectal resection&#xD;
      with total mesorectal excision, TME); stage of cancer; distance between the hospital and&#xD;
      place of residence; operative time; intraoperative blood loss significantly prolong LOS&#xD;
      (primary length of stay, excluding readmissions). Moreover, the compliance with ERAS protocol&#xD;
      and its influence on LOS was analysed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the purposes of further analyses the entire group of patients was divided into 2&#xD;
      subgroups depending on the length of their hospital stay. On admission every patient received&#xD;
      the information about the target length of stay of 4 days. Group 1 consisted of patients&#xD;
      whose hospital stay was shorter or equal to the target LOS (≤ 4 days). In group 2 were&#xD;
      patients whose hospital stay was longer than 4 days.&#xD;

        The analysis included prospectively collected data from consecutive patients electively&#xD;
        operated for colorectal cancer in the years 2013-2014. All patients were operated using&#xD;
        laparoscopic surgery, and the perioperative care was based on pre-established ERAS protocol&#xD;
        consisting of 13 items&#xD;
