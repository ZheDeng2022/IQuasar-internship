  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Malaria is a protozoan infection transmitted by anopheline mosquitoes. The most severe forms&#xD;
      are caused by Plasmodium (P) falciparum and to a much lesser extent by P. vivax.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although the interest in research on malaria has increased during the last years, yet little&#xD;
      research is conducted on the &quot;neglected&quot; malaria species P. ovale and P. malariae. P. ovale&#xD;
      being first described in 1922, it still remains unclear whether it displays dormant&#xD;
      pre-erythrocytic liver stages, so called hypnozoites, or not. Primaquine, the only marketed&#xD;
      drug with liver stage activity at present, can cause severe hemolysis in glucose-6-phosphate&#xD;
      dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficient persons and methemoglobinemia. Because G6PD is widely spread&#xD;
      in Central Africa, it is important to explore whether additional intake of liver-active&#xD;
      medication is really needed and on this account further research to investigating new&#xD;
      treatment options with liver stage activity should be conducted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While, due to widespread resistance, treatment recommendations for P. falciparum and mixed&#xD;
      infections have switched from chloroquine to the safer applicable artemisinin-based&#xD;
      combination therapies (ACTs), World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines still suggest&#xD;
      chloroquine as first line treatment for P. malariae and P. ovale mono infections. Further&#xD;
      studies assessing alternative treatment options are largely missing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Summing up the current situation for both topics shows the need for further research.&#xD;
      Therefore this study aims to assess the evidence and characterize the frequency of relapses&#xD;
      in P. ovale infections with respect to differences between its subspecies as well as the&#xD;
      effectiveness of the ACT artemether-lumefantrine in P. malariae and P. ovale mono- and mixed&#xD;
      infections.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Although P. ovale hypnozoites have never been demonstrated by biological experiments and&#xD;
      findings in the literature about relapses are controversial, a 14 days primaquine standard&#xD;
      therapy is recommended for every patient suffering from P. ovale infection. As there is no&#xD;
      clear evidence of relapses of P. ovale it is of importance to conclusively analyze clinical&#xD;
      evidence for its relapse potential to evaluate the necessity for further anti-relapse&#xD;
      treatment options.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Moreover, summarizing the actual situation shows the need for further evaluation of the&#xD;
      clinical use of ACTs in non-falciparum infections:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Firstly, molecular diagnostic methods indicate that P. malariae and P. ovale are more&#xD;
           prevalent than previously thought. In many settings malaria is treated on clinical&#xD;
           suspicion. Diagnosis by microscopy is difficult if parasitemia is low and&#xD;
           differentiation of species requires experience. This leads to the assumption that P.&#xD;
           malariae and P. ovale infections are already blindly treated with the common ACTs&#xD;
           recommended for P. falciparum malaria. The evaluation of artemisinin based combination&#xD;
           therapies for non-falciparum malaria is therefore essential.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Secondly, combination therapies have proven to be protective for the emergence of&#xD;
           resistant parasites and in Asia combination therapy could even reduce resistance. As&#xD;
           chloroquine-resistant P. malariae parasites have been reported, a combination therapy&#xD;
           should be implemented in order to stop the emergence and spread of further resistance.&#xD;
           Additionally, artemisinins can, in contrast to chloroquine, reduce transmissibility by&#xD;
           their gametocytocidal activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A uniform treatment algorithm for all four Plasmodium species would simplify and facilitate&#xD;
      treatment of malaria. With the reduction of chloroquine use in settings of poor quality&#xD;
      diagnosis, the risk of fatal treatment failure due to wrongly administered chloroquine to&#xD;
      chloroquine-resistant P. falciparum would be decreased. Finally, if no 8-aminoquinoline&#xD;
      treatment was necessary for P. ovale infections, this could improve the safety and compliance&#xD;
      of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is designed as an open label prospective study with a within group design. Patients&#xD;
      enrolled will receive oral artemether-lumefantrine tablets as a 6 dose regimen over 3&#xD;
      consecutive days (Day 0, 1 and 2). Dosage depends on the patient's weight is according to the&#xD;
      manufacturers recommendations. Patients will be followed for 42 days. If P. ovale is&#xD;
      diagnosed at baseline, a one-year follow-up will be conducted every second week.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Parasite density, expressed as the number of parasites per microliter (µl) of blood, will be&#xD;
      measured regularly to determine parasite clearance time (PCT).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood smears preparation, staining, examination and interpretation will be done according to&#xD;
      the Lambaréné method. Thick and thin blood films for parasite count and species diagnosis&#xD;
      should be obtained and examined at screening on D0 to confirm inclusion/exclusion criteria.&#xD;
      Thick blood films will be examined every 24h following first dose administration and until&#xD;
      the parasites have cleared. Thick and thin blood films will be also examined on Days 7, 14,&#xD;
      21, 28, 35 and 42 or on any other day if the patient spontaneously returns. For participants&#xD;
      with P. ovale infection at baseline, reading of thick and thin blood films will be continued&#xD;
      every second week for up to one year. In case of reappearance of parasites, Coartem will be&#xD;
      administered again and Follow-up will be continued as scheduled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Diagnosis of P. ovale will be effected by PCR. Furthermore, genotyping studies will be used&#xD;
      to differentiate a new infection from relapse or recrudescence and to confirm microscopic&#xD;
      diagnosis of species. Plasma samples will be collected and stored for further pharmacokinetic&#xD;
      analysis 7 days after treatment initiation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine the efficacy clinically, body temperature and clinical signs and symptoms of&#xD;
      malaria will be assessed. Safety assessments include physical examination, vital signs and&#xD;
      hematology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events will be ascertained. The investigator or his / her&#xD;
      staff will notify the Independent Ethics Committee of all Serious Adverse Events as soon as&#xD;
      possible and in accordance with local regulations.&#xD;
