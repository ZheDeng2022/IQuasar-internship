  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The metabolic function of different white adipose tissue depots in the body and its role in&#xD;
      the development of type 2 diabetes (T2D) remains unclear. Several studies have used fluor-18&#xD;
      fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography with computed tomography (FDG PET/CT) to&#xD;
      image the metabolic activity of different adipose tissues in lean and obese healthy subjects&#xD;
      and in patients with T2D with or without euglycaemic hyperinsulinemic clamping, describing&#xD;
      differences in metabolic activity of visceral adipose tissue (VAT), subcutaneous adipose&#xD;
      tissue (SAT) and gluteal-femoral adipose tissue (GFAT). Recently, FDG PET/CT showed high&#xD;
      glucose uptake in VAT and SAT under unintentional hypoglycaemic conditions in a non-diabetic&#xD;
      patient. Evaluation of potential differences in FDG uptake in white adipose tissue between&#xD;
      healthy volunteers and T2D patients and between VAT, SAT and GFAT in these subjects under&#xD;
      hyperinsulinemic hypoglycaemic conditions would be of great value in further exploring the&#xD;
      pathogenesis of insulin resistance in T2D.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Type 2 diabetes has become a worldwide epidemic with a prevalence of approximately 700,000&#xD;
      patients and an annual incidence of 70,000 in the Netherlands. The development of T2D depends&#xD;
      on both genetic and nutritional factors and is characterized by insufficient insulin&#xD;
      secretion by the pancreatic beta-cells and insulin resistance in liver, skeletal muscle and&#xD;
      white adipose tissue. Insulin resistance often precedes beta-cell loss and is associated with&#xD;
      central obesity, high blood pressure, hyperinsulinemia and dyslipidemia, all of which may&#xD;
      lead to microvascular and cardiovascular complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      White adipose tissue is increasingly considered a key metabolic organ in the development of&#xD;
      insulin resistance. Especially the distribution of adipose tissue in the body is important.&#xD;
      Indeed, visceral adipose tissue is a risk factor for coronary heart disease, certain cancers&#xD;
      and T2D and associated with an increased cardiovascular and all-cause mortality, whereas&#xD;
      excess of subcutaneous adipose tissue is not. There are distinct differences in the&#xD;
      functional and hormonal characteristics of VAT and SAT, which may explain part of the&#xD;
      mechanisms underlying the development of insulin resistance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A more complete understanding of the molecular mechanisms that lead to T2D will enable the&#xD;
      identification of individuals at highest risk, which could lead to more targeted prevention&#xD;
      and pharmacological therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      FDG PET/CT is an established tomographic technique to image glucose metabolism with validated&#xD;
      applications in oncology, infectious and inflammatory diseases, brain metabolism and cardiac&#xD;
      viability. Several studies exploring the usefulness of FDG PET in imaging glucose metabolism&#xD;
      in white adipose tissue reported lower overall glucose uptake in obese than in lean subjects.&#xD;
      In both subject groups, glucose uptake was higher in VAT than in SAT. Glucose uptake in VAT&#xD;
      and SAT was inversely related to insulin resistance, but uptake in GFAT was not. There are&#xD;
      only few studies analyzing glucose uptake in patients with T2D with FDG PET/CT. In one study&#xD;
      the impact of abdominal obesity and newly diagnosed T2D on insulin action in adipose tissue&#xD;
      was evaluated, suggesting an excess of SAT to provide a sink for glucose, and thereby&#xD;
      resulting in a compensatory decrease in insulin resistance. More research is needed to&#xD;
      demonstrate the differences in glucose uptake in various adipose tissue depots in patients&#xD;
      with T2D and correlate it with insulin resistance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to keep glucose at a constant level during the FDG PET examination, usually a&#xD;
      hyperinsulinemic euglycaemic glucose clamp is performed before scanning. Recently, a&#xD;
      case-report was published describing an FDG PET/CT during an iatrogenic hypoglycemic state in&#xD;
      a non-diabetic patient, which demonstrated remarkably increased glucose uptake in VAT and&#xD;
      SAT. Based on this observation we hypothesize that glucose uptake during a hypoglycaemic&#xD;
      state will be more pronounced in various adipose tissue depots. To our knowledge, this has&#xD;
      not been performed in healthy volunteers or in patients with T2D. A controlled hypoglycemic&#xD;
      state may be achieved by a hyperinsulinemic hypoglycaemic clamp, which has been used in&#xD;
      several clinical studies. A demonstration of differences in FDG uptake in white adipose&#xD;
      tissue between healthy volunteers and T2D patients and between VAT, SAT and GFAT under&#xD;
      hypoglycaemic conditions would provide more insight in the glucose metabolism of adipose&#xD;
      tissue and contribute to our understanding of insulin resistance in T2D. Even more&#xD;
      importantly, this imaging technique might help to better characterise patients with T2D or&#xD;
      patients at risk to develop T2D, and may thereby help to increase our understanding of the&#xD;
      pathophysiology of T2D and the metabolic syndrome, which could lead to more targeted&#xD;
      prevention in patients at risk and to personalised pharmacological therapy after the onset of&#xD;
      clinically overt disease.&#xD;
