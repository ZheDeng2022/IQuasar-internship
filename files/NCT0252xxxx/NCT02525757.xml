  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical research study is to learn about the safety of adding MDPL3280A to&#xD;
      standard chemotherapy (a combination of carboplatin and paclitaxel) and radiation in patients&#xD;
      with lung cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You are being asked to take part in this study because you have non-small cell lung cancer&#xD;
      (NSCLC) that is unresectable (cannot be removed by surgery) and has not spread.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an investigational study. MPDL3280A is not FDA approved or commercially available. It&#xD;
      is currently being used for research purposes only. Paclitaxel, carboplatin, and the&#xD;
      radiation therapy are all FDA approved for the treatment of lung cancer. The use of these&#xD;
      drugs in combination is considered investigational.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 40 participants will be enrolled in this study. All will take part at MD Anderson.&#xD;

      Study Groups and Study Drug Administration:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each study cycle is 21 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, depending on when you join the&#xD;
      study, you will be assigned to 1 of 2 study groups. Up to 10 participants will be assigned to&#xD;
      Group 1 and up to 30 will be assigned to Group 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants in Groups 1 and 2 will receive standard chemotherapy 1 time each week and&#xD;
      radiation therapy 5 days per week as described below Every cycle you will also receive&#xD;
      MPDL3280A by vein over about 1 hour.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are in Group 1, you will receive standard chemotherapy and radiation for 6-7 weeks,&#xD;
      followed by around a 3-8 week &quot;rest period&quot; when you will receive no chemotherapy or&#xD;
      radiation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are in Group 2, you will receive MPDL3280A, standard chemotherapy, and radiation&#xD;
      therapy for 6-7 weeks. This will be followed by a rest period of 3-4 weeks, during which time&#xD;
      you will receive 1 dose of MPDL3280A but no chemotherapy or radiation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the rest period, Groups 1 and 2 will both receive MPDL3280A in addition to chemotherapy&#xD;
      for 2 cycles (called the consolidation period). After completing the consolidation period,&#xD;
      you will continue to receive MPDL3280A alone for up to 1 year (called the maintenance&#xD;
      period).&#xD;
&#xD;
      During your first dose of MPDL3280A, your vital signs (blood pressure, pulse, temperature,&#xD;
      and breathing rate) will be measured 60 minutes before the dose, every 15 minutes during the&#xD;
      dose, and 30 minutes after the dose to check for any bad reaction to the study drug. You may&#xD;
      be given standard drugs to help with side effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you need to stop receiving chemotherapy due to side effects, you will also stop receiving&#xD;
      MPDL3280A. If you stop receiving chemotherapy for any other reason, you may continue&#xD;
      receiving MPDL3280A.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Visits:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once a week during Weeks 1-7:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a physical exam.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (up to 2 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests and to check your liver and&#xD;
           kidney function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Between Weeks 8-16 you will have a rest period. The rest period could range from 3-8 weeks,&#xD;
      after which time you will return for the consolidation period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One (1) time during consolidation period, which starts after the rest period, during Weeks&#xD;
      1-3 and Weeks 4-6 of the consolidation period:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a physical exam.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (up to 2 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests and to check your liver and&#xD;
           kidney function.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have either a CT scan or an FDG-PET/CT scan to check the status of the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After you complete the consolidation period, you will enter the maintenance period. During&#xD;
      every cycle of the maintenance period, blood (about 2 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine&#xD;
      tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Every 2 cycles during the maintenance period, for up to 1 year:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a physical exam.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have either a CT scan or an FDG-PET/CT scan to check the status of the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the disease appears to come back at any time during the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a physical exam.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a CT scan or MRI of the brain to check the status of the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have either a CT scan or an FDG-PET/CT of your chest and abdomen to check the&#xD;
           status of the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a biopsy of any suspicious areas found on the scans to check the status of&#xD;
           the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Your doctor may choose to continue the study drug and repeat the scans in 6-8 weeks to&#xD;
           check the status of the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If your doctor feels that the study drug is no longer effective from the information&#xD;
           obtained from the repeat scans, you will be taken off the study drug. You will continue&#xD;
           to be followed up by a schedule determined by your doctor.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Your doctor may offer alternative treatments if your doctor feels it is in your best&#xD;
           interest.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Length of Treatment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      You may receive the study drug for up to 1 year after starting the consolidation period, as&#xD;
      long as the doctor thinks it is in your best interest. You will no longer be able to receive&#xD;
      study drug if the disease gets worse, if intolerable side effects occur, or if you are unable&#xD;
      to follow study directions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are taken off study during the consolidation or maintenance period due to intolerable&#xD;
      side effects, you will be followed by the study staff as often the doctor thinks is needed&#xD;
      until the side effects get better.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Your active participation on the study will be over after the follow-up visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up Visits:&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will have follow-up visits every 2-4 months for up to 2 years after your last dose of&#xD;
      study drug, unless you leave the study due to side effects or the disease having appeared to&#xD;
      come back. After 2 years, you will have follow-up visits about every 4-6 months based on what&#xD;
      your doctor thinks is best.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At each follow-up visit, the following tests will be performed:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a physical exam.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have either a CT scan or an FDG-PET/CT scan of your chest and abdomen to check&#xD;
           the status of the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If your doctor thinks it is needed, blood (up to 2 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine&#xD;
           tests and to check your liver and kidney function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you cannot return to MD Anderson for these visits, you may be called by a member of the&#xD;
      study staff every 3-6 months for 4 years after the last dose of study drug. Each call should&#xD;
      last about 10 minutes. The study staff may ask that any tests or scans done by your home&#xD;
      doctor be sent to MD Anderson to check the status of the disease.&#xD;

             slides, with an associated pathology report, requested at any time prior to study&#xD;
             entry. Only tissue from core needle, punch, or excisional biopsy sample collection&#xD;
             will be accepted. Fine-needle aspiration, brushing, and lavage samples are not&#xD;
             acceptable. For all biopsy types, submitted blocks should have sufficient tissue to&#xD;
             generate at least 10 sections, and tissue for which the pathology report specifies&#xD;
             that the overall tumor content is low (e.g., &quot;sparse&quot; or &quot;scant&quot;) is not acceptable.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Cont'd from #4: If archival tissue is either insufficient or unavailable, the patient&#xD;

             collection of the tumor. Fine needle aspiration, brushing, and lavage samples are not&#xD;
             acceptable. The immediate unavailability of tissue blocks or unstained slides aside&#xD;
             from the slides needed for diagnostic confirmation of lung cancer does not exclude&#xD;
             patients from this trial. If the patient chooses to not undergo a repeat biopsy aside&#xD;
             from biopsy for diagnostic purposes, the patient will still be eligible to enroll on&#xD;
             2014-0722. However, availability of core or excisional biopsy samples must be&#xD;
             ascertained prior to enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Patients must have histologically confirmed, untreated non-small cell lung cancer that&#xD;

             anticipation that such a live attenuated vaccine will be required during the study&#xD;
             *Influenza vaccination should be given during influenza season only (approximately&#xD;
             October to March). Patients must not receive live, attenuated influenza vaccine (e.g.,&#xD;
             FluMist) within 4 weeks prior to treatment start or at any time during the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
         18. Malignancies within 3 years prior to treatment start, with the exception of those with&#xD;
             a negligible risk of metastasis or death and with expected curative outcome (such as&#xD;
             adequately treated carcinoma in situ of the cervix, basal or squamous cell skin&#xD;
             cancer, localized prostate cancer treated surgically with curative intent, or ductal&#xD;
             carcinoma in situ treated surgically with curative intent) or undergoing active&#xD;
             surveillance per standard-of-care management (e.g., CLL Rai Stage 0, prostate cancer&#xD;
             with Gleason score &lt;/= 6, and PSA &lt;/= 10 mg/mL, etc.)&#xD;
&#xD;
         19. FOLLOWING ARE Medication-Related Exclusion Criteria: *Treatment with systemic&#xD;
             immunostimulatory agents (including but not limited to IFN-a, IL-2) within 6 weeks or&#xD;
             five half-lives of the drug (whichever is shorter) prior to the start of&#xD;
             chemoradiation.Treatment with investigational agent within 4 weeks prior to Cycle 1,&#xD;
             Day 1 (or within five half lives of the investigational product, whichever is longer)&#xD;
&#xD;
         20. Treatment with systemic immunosuppressive medications (including but not limited to&#xD;
             prednisone, cyclophosphamide, azathioprine, methotrexate, thalidomide, and anti-tumor&#xD;
             necrosis factor [TNF] agents) within 2 weeks prior to Cycle 1, Day 1 *Patients who&#xD;
             have received acute, low dose, systemic immunosuppressant medications (e.g., a&#xD;
             one-time dose of dexamethasone for nausea) may be enrolled. *The use of inhaled&#xD;
             corticosteroids and mineralocorticoids (e.g., fludrocortisone) for patients with&#xD;
             orthostatic hypotension or adrenocortical insufficiency is allowed.&#xD;
&#xD;
         21. History of severe allergic, anaphylactic, or other hypersensitivity reactions to&#xD;
             chimeric or humanized antibodies or fusion proteins&#xD;
