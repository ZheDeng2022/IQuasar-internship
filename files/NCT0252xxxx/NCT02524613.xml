    <textblock>
      Bone marrow biopsy is a frequently performed procedure to diagnose and evaluate hematologic&#xD;
      diseases. It is estimated that over 700,000 bone marrow procedures (BMP's) are performed&#xD;
      annually in the U.S. Most of them are performed by practicing hematologists/oncologists in&#xD;
      their offices or hospitals. However, a significant number are performed by&#xD;
      hematologists-in-training (H-I-T's) in teaching hospitals. However, the incidences of&#xD;
      complications associated with bone marrow biopsy are largely unknown. This study has two&#xD;
      goals:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The first goal is to objectively determine by CT and clinical assessment, the actual&#xD;
           risk to patients of the bone marrow biopsy and the rate of pelvic injury in an&#xD;
           unselected group of hematology patients requiring a bone marrow biopsy, as performed by&#xD;
           hematologist-in-training.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The second goal is to determine the quality of bone marrow biopsies obtained, using the&#xD;
           lateral angulation technique.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Subjects must have a hematological or oncological condition which requires a bone&#xD;
             marrow aspiration and biopsy procedure, and no alternative procedures are available&#xD;
             for diagnosis, staging, monitoring or follow up of their disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Subjects must be able to understand the risks/benefits and provide written informed&#xD;
             consent to participate in the study, and be willing to participate in all required&#xD;
             study activities for the duration of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Subjects must be 40 years of age or older.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Patients unable to give consent because they are decisionally impaired or have a&#xD;
             language barrier that cannot be overcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Psychiatric or cognitive illness or recreational drug/alcohol abuse that, in the&#xD;
             opinion of the investigator would effect subject safety and/or compliance.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Patients with uncontrolled bleeding disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Pregnant and lactating females (due to radiation exposure during the CT scans).&#xD;
