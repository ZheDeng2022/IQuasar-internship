      To investigate whether multiparametric MRI (mp-MRI) in patients with low-risk prostate cancer&#xD;
      can improve the selection of patients suitable for Active Surveillance and have a relevance&#xD;
      in the ongoing monitoring.&#xD;

      Men with localized prostate cancer (PCa) with small tumor burden may be followed on active&#xD;
      surveillance (AS) rather than active treatment. AS is an attempt to avoid over-treatment of&#xD;
      PCa, which is estimated to be insignificant at the time of diagnosis, and therefore unlikely&#xD;
      to affect patient morbidity and mortality. AS include close monitoring with PSA measurement&#xD;
      (blood test), digital rectal exploration (DRE) and trans-rectal ultrasound-guided prostate&#xD;
      biopsy (TRUS-bx) at regular intervals, so that active treatment can be initiated if the&#xD;
      cancer becomes more aggressive. It is crucial that patients undergoing AS are staged&#xD;
      correctly, to avoid underestimating more aggressive disease and patients mistakenly are&#xD;
      enrolled into AS instead of active treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Previously, a PhD study conducted at Herlev Hospital revealed that multiparametric MRI&#xD;
      (mp-MRI) of the prostate can improve the detection and staging of PCa and may add additional&#xD;
      information about tumor aggressiveness compared to the traditional methods DRE and TRUS-bx.&#xD;
      Mp-MRI at the inclusion of AS may detect missed significant tumors and potential areas of&#xD;
      higher aggressiveness than detected by the traditional biopsies. Additional targeted biopsies&#xD;
      from these suspicious areas can then be performed with a re-evaluation of the treatment plan,&#xD;
      if more advanced disease is identified. Conversely, mp-MRI has a high negative predicted&#xD;
      value for significant disease and can be used to rule out significant PCa, reassuring&#xD;
      patients and physicians to go on with AS. Mp-MRI has been used at the Urology Department,&#xD;
      Herlev Hospital, since 2013 in the diagnosis of PCa and in the evaluation of patients&#xD;
      undergoing AS. The main objective of this study is to retrospectively investigate, whether&#xD;
      mp-MRI can improve the selection of patients suitable for Active Surveillance and have a&#xD;
      relevance in the ongoing monitoring.&#xD;
