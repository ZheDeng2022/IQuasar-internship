  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A cardiotocograph (CTG) can be used in labour to assess the heartbeat and well-being of a&#xD;
      baby. An abnormal CTG may be a sign that a baby has low oxygen levels (hypoxia) and is&#xD;
      becoming distressed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this situation a blood test can be taken from the scalp of the baby. A high lactate level&#xD;
      in the blood indicates that urgent delivery is required to prevent long-term harm to the&#xD;
      newborn.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SensPoint is a new medical device that measures lactate. It has several potential benefits&#xD;
      over the current method of measuring lactate in that it is a portable hand-held device&#xD;
      (allowing for use in the delivery room), requires a much smaller volume of blood and produces&#xD;
      results more quickly than the current method of measuring lactate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before a new device is adopted into clinical practice, it is important that it is first&#xD;
      confirmed that it is accurate and reliable for its intended use. This study will evaluate the&#xD;
      ability of the SensPoint device to accurately and reliably detect lactate in fetal and&#xD;
      umbilical cord blood by comparing its performance to the reference device currently in use.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      A cardiotocograph (CTG) can be used in labour to assess the heartbeat and well-being of a&#xD;
      baby. An abnormal CTG may be a sign that a baby has low oxygen levels (hypoxia) and is&#xD;
      becoming distressed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this situation a blood test can be taken from the scalp of the baby. A high lactate level&#xD;
      or high acidity (low pH) in the blood indicates that urgent delivery is required to prevent&#xD;
      long-term harm to the newborn.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Obtaining scalp blood can be difficult, time consuming and has a high failure rate. In the UK&#xD;
      the majority of maternity units (including at North Bristol NHS Trust) will use a blood gas&#xD;
      analyser to measure lactate. These are generally large, non-transportable devices located in&#xD;
      or nearby the maternity unit. The blood gas analyser requires relatively large drops of&#xD;
      baby's blood and due to it's fixed location, requires the midwife to leave the delivery room&#xD;
      to process. Samples that are too small or contain air bubbles and blood clots will be&#xD;
      rejected and need repeating. The process can take up to twenty minutes to complete.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After delivery blood from the umbilical cord is routinely obtained in high-risk deliveries&#xD;
      for the measurement of pH and lactate. This establishes the wellbeing of the baby at the time&#xD;
      of birth and can guide on-going treatment. Lactate in these samples is also measured using&#xD;
      the blood gas analyser.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SensPoint is a new medical device that measures lactate. It has several potential benefits&#xD;
      over the current method of measuring lactate in that it is a portable hand-held device&#xD;
      (allowing for use in the delivery room), requires a much smaller volume of blood and produces&#xD;
      results more quickly than the current method of measuring lactate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before a new device is adopted into clinical practice, it is important that it is first&#xD;
      confirmed that it is accurate and reliable for its intended use. The researchers propose a&#xD;
      study that will evaluate the ability of the SensPoint device to accurately and reliably&#xD;
      detect lactate in both the laboratory and clinical setting by comparing its performance to&#xD;
      the reference device currently in use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be divided into three parts:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Comparison of the SensPoint device and the reference device in laboratory prepared&#xD;
           samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Comparison of the SensPoint device and the reference device using small volumes of&#xD;
           leftover blood from umbilical cord blood testing obtained during routine care.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Comparison of the SensPoint device and the reference device using small volumes of&#xD;
           leftover blood from foetal scalp sampling obtained during routine care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All foetal blood samples utilised in this study are surplus to clinical requirements and&#xD;
      would otherwise be discarded. Retrospective consent will be obtained.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the purposes of ensuring validity, reliability and repeatability of the device the&#xD;
      researchers will test 90 laboratory standard samples, 90 arterial and venous cord blood&#xD;
      samples and 90 foetal scalp capillary blood samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will enable the research team to design a larger study directly comparing the two&#xD;
      methods of measuring lactate, assessing factors such as speed and patient satisfaction.&#xD;
