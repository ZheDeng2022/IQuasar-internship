  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      TACT is a &quot;real world&quot; randomized controlled trial of tecarfarin, a novel vitamin K&#xD;
      antagonist, vs. warfarin. The quality of anticoagulation control will be compared for the two&#xD;
      groups of subjects who require chronic oral anticoagulation for a broad panel of indications.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This will be a randomized, parallel-arm, open-label study comparing the safety and efficacy&#xD;
      of tecarfarin and warfarin in approximately 1000 subjects who have an indication for chronic&#xD;
      oral anticoagulation. The study will be fully enriched with subjects who are taking at least&#xD;
      one CYP2C9-interacting medication and have either chronic kidney disease stage 3 or 4 and/or&#xD;
      a genetic variant allele for CYP2C9. The study will be conducted at approximately 140 sites&#xD;
      with experience in the management of anticoagulation subjects. Eligible subjects will be&#xD;
      randomized to receive either tecarfarin or warfarin for a period ranging from 6 months to a&#xD;
      maximum of approximately 24 months.&#xD;
