  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Breast cancer is a public health problem in Mexico and its incidence rises when the woman is&#xD;
      still premenopausal. Estrogen metabolism has been linked to breast cancer. Several studies&#xD;
      reported that high concentrations of 2 hydroxyestrone (2OHE1) in urine have a protective&#xD;
      effect for this neoplasia, whereas high concentrations of 16 alpha-hydroxyestrone (16αOHE1)&#xD;
      in urine have the opposite effect, further has been reported that women with a ratio of&#xD;
      estrogen metabolites 2OHE1:16αOHE1 in urine (REMU) less than 0.9, have ten times the risk of&#xD;
      developing Breast Cancer than those women with an RMEU equal or more than 0.9. Other studies&#xD;
      have showed that the active compounds of cruciferous vegetables, indole-3-carbinol (I3C) and&#xD;
      its dimer, 3'3'diindolylmethane (DIM) induce benign pathway of metabolism of estrogens&#xD;
      producing 2OHE1. Several studies, evaluate the pharmacokinetics and effect of I3C&#xD;
      supplementation, finding that 300 to 600 mg of this compound are well tolerated and able to&#xD;
      promote formation of 2OHE1 in women when supplemented for one month. In the case of DIM, only&#xD;
      a pilot study has explored its effect in postmenopausal women with personal history of breast&#xD;
      cancer in early stages, reporting an increase in the concentrations of 2OHE1. The purpose of&#xD;
      this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of supplementation with DIM to increase urinary&#xD;
      RMEU in premenopausal women at risk of Breast Cancer (RMEU less than 0.9). A clinical,&#xD;
      randomized, double-blind study was performed with women attending on the urogynecology&#xD;
      service of Institute National of Perinatology. Subjects were premenopausal women over 34&#xD;
      years who were healthy. The inclusion criteria's was had a RMEU less than 0.9 and were&#xD;
      excluded for any medical condition, medication, or dietary or lifestyle habit that might&#xD;
      interfere with estrogen metabolism. Patients were randomly assigned to one of two groups: one&#xD;
      received orally at a daily dose of 75 mg of DIM for a period of 30 days and other group&#xD;
      received orally at a daily placebo for a period of 30 days. All urine samples were collected&#xD;
      from the women before DIM or placebo ingestion, after 30 days of DIM or placebo ingestion and&#xD;
      finally after another 30 days once suspended supplementation. Analysis of the 2OHE1 and&#xD;
      16αOHE1 were determined using a commercially kit ESTRAMET™. The change in metabolites median&#xD;
      concentrations and RMEU was assessed through the Wilcoxon test and these differences between&#xD;
      groups through U Mann-Whitney test.&#xD;

      The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of supplementation with&#xD;
      3,3´-Diindolylmethane (DIM) to increase the urinary ratio of estrogen metabolites&#xD;
      2OHE1:16alphaOHE1 (RMEU) in women at risk of breast cancer to contribute to generate a tool&#xD;
      of early prevention of this disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Activities for detect women with REMU less than 0.9:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Check every day in the Institute National of Perinatology urogynecology service, clinical&#xD;
      records of the women who attending consultations in order to verify the inclusion and&#xD;
      exclusion criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interviewing these women to corroborate the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Quantify the&#xD;
      concentrations of metabolites of estrogens in the urine for detect the presence of REMU less&#xD;
      than 0.9.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Provide result and invite women who present REMU less than 0.9 to participate in the project&#xD;
      of supplementation with DIM.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When women had a REMU equal or greater than 0.9, provide result and dietary guidance focused&#xD;
      on maintaining BMI in normal range (19.0-24.9) or decrease (BMI more than or equal to 25)&#xD;
      weight and the increase in the consumption of fruits and vegetables.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Activities for women inclusion in the study of DIM supplementation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once explained the study to the patients, women who met the criteria for inclusion were cited&#xD;
      to provide an informed consent letter mentioning them that they had the freedom to clarify&#xD;
      any doubt that might arise.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once the woman read out the letter, understood it and agreed to participate, the signing of&#xD;
      this was requested.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the same date that each woman has signed the letter, another appointment was scheduled&#xD;
      between day 12 and 15 of the menstrual cycle for the following assessments:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Personal data: Name, date of birth, address, phone, marital status and occupation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Socioeconomic: With the criteria of the Mexican Association of Agencies of Market and Opinion&#xD;
      based 2005&#xD;
&#xD;
      Complete clinical history that included:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Family history of chronic diseases included breast cancer, personal history of diseases and&#xD;
      use medication, personal risk factors of breast cancer, type, frequency and duration of&#xD;
      physical activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nutrition: Whereas both anthropometric indicators (weight, height and perimeter wrist, waist&#xD;
      and hip), body composition (% of body fat and lean mass by the method of displacement of air)&#xD;
      and diet (24-hour recall, frequency of consumption of cruciferous vegetables in the last year&#xD;
      and use of supplements). The measurements of anthropometric indicators were made using the&#xD;
      LOHMAN technique. The information was processed with the NUTRIKCAL system that is&#xD;
      standardized for foods commonly consumed in Mexico.&#xD;
&#xD;
      First morning urine. First morning urine with a difference no less than eight hours of&#xD;
      previous urine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once urine samples were received, added them, for conservation, 0.1 g of ascorbic acid per 10&#xD;
      mL of urine, and stored at -70°C until it´s quantification.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the analysis of the metabolites 2OHE1 and 16αOHE1, was used a competitive solid phase&#xD;
      enzyme immunoassay method, using the commercial kit ESTRAMET™ 2/16 (Immune Care Corporation,&#xD;
      Bethlehem, MI. USA), which was validated by the manufacturer by gas chromatography and mass&#xD;
      spectrometry. The analysis was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions;&#xD;
      briefly: the urine sample was hydrolyzed with an enzyme beta glucuronidase and sulfatase&#xD;
      activities. The free urinary metabolites, joined to monoclonal antibodies conjugated with&#xD;
      alkaline phosphatase. The quantification of metabolites 2OHE1 and 16αOHE1 were performed in&#xD;
      triplicate and the reproducibility of this method has already been reported by our team in a&#xD;
      study. For each of the determinations of the RMEU were reference curves, achieving a 97% of&#xD;
      accuracy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adherence and side effects. In the first assessment is gave women a calendar to daily record&#xD;
      consumption or omission of the supplement (active compound or placebo) as well as a series of&#xD;
      side effects in order to assess the adherence and safety of supplement. This included side&#xD;
      effects that had already been reported in other studies with DIM and I3C. In addition&#xD;
      requested participants return the supplements vial to subsequently make the count of pills&#xD;
      that were left over.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To estimate the sample size it was considered the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two sets of comparison (Placebo and 75mg DIM). According to literature and hoping to find a&#xD;
      difference of .48 in the average of RMEU of the group of supplementation relative to the&#xD;
      placebo group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Other studies have reported a standard deviation of .77 on the RMEU. Calculated with an alpha&#xD;
      of 0.05 and a power of 80%. Approximately 31 women are required by group plus 10% to replace&#xD;
      losses in the follow-up, which gives an approximate total of 35 women per group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis. The statistical analysis of data was carried out in the following way:&#xD;
      the differences between baseline characteristics was performed using the student T test for&#xD;
      parametric variables with normal distribution, U Mann-Whitney for those who did not have a&#xD;
      normal distribution and X2 for the nonparametric. The change of estrogen metabolites and RMEU&#xD;
      in each group was evaluated using the Wilcoxon test and the comparison of the effect between&#xD;
      groups, the values of concentrations of the metabolites of estrogen and the RMEU as well as&#xD;
      their differences, was carried out by means of the test U Mann-Whitney.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Masking. A stranger to the study researcher, received and coded vials containing the DIM&#xD;
      supplement and placebo, recording the code in a role that was kept in an envelope that was&#xD;
      opened at the end of the study.&#xD;
