  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the safety and immunogenicity of live attenuated vaccine in adults aged&#xD;
      50 years and older. Half of participants will receive high doses of the vaccine,while the&#xD;
      other half will receive low doses of the vaccine in phase I clinical trial. At the phase II&#xD;
      clinical trial, participants will be distributed equally to four groups(low、middle, high&#xD;
      doses of the vaccine and placebo).&#xD;
