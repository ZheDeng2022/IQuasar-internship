  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Fibromyalgia syndrome (FMS) is a common chronic musculoskeletal pain disorder of unknown&#xD;
      etiology, characterized by generalized body pain, hyperalgesia and other functional and&#xD;
      emotional comorbidities. Women are predominantly affected. Long term prognosis of FMS might&#xD;
      be severe by its physical and psychological consequences. The etiology of FMS remains unknown&#xD;
      but recent studies suggest a disorder of central pain modulation, neurotransmitters,&#xD;
      sympatho-adrenal and hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal system and peripheral muscles issues.&#xD;
      Indeed, muscular abnormalities with a decrease of ATP and micro vascularization have been&#xD;
      reported, inducing muscle weakness and local biochemical changes that participate to pain&#xD;
      hyper sensitivity. Treatment of FMS is only symptomatic, often difficult, associating&#xD;
      pharmacological and non-pharmacological therapies. Massages are largely used in FMS and are&#xD;
      included in chronic pain management recommendations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Massages are recognized as haptic when the hands of the practitioner move on the skin of the&#xD;
      patient; haptic massage is superficial if the pressure applied on the skin is similar to the&#xD;
      weight of the hand and it's a deep haptic massage when the pressure applied is over the&#xD;
      weight of the hand, allowing reaching deep muscle structure. Deep haptic massages are largely&#xD;
      used for athlete to improve muscle recovery and treat tendinitis. All massages evaluate in&#xD;
      FMS are superficial haptic massage; they are recognized as efficient on pain, anxiety and&#xD;
      depression if they are performed at least on 5 weeks but these effects are transient et&#xD;
      remain to be optimized. The efficacy of deep haptic massage has not been evaluated in&#xD;
      pathological conditions. The investigators hypothesize that, in FMS patients, deep&#xD;
      intramuscular maneuvers may solicit sensitive receptors, stimulating large caliber fibers A&#xD;
      lemniscal conveyed by the way that bypass chronic pain information carried by the C fibers of&#xD;
      the extra-lemniscal pathway: this is the &quot;Gate Control&quot; theory for inhibiting pain&#xD;
      information.&#xD;

    <description>To evaluate the effectiveness of the Massage Haptic in 20 women with FMS (defined according to the criteria of the American College of Rheumatology and active disease defined by a Widespread Pain Index (WPI)vscore ≥ 7 and a symptom severity score (SS) ≥ 5 or WPI between 3 and 6 and SS score ≥ 9), recruited in the clinics of the Rheumatology Department of Nice, after 6 weeks of deep haptic massage at 2 sessions of 30 minutes per week.&#xD;
Primary endpoint: overall score of impact questionnaire fibromyalgia (QIF). Indeed, in the fibromyalgia studies QIF is used as a criterion for evaluating the effectiveness of drug treatments like non-drug treatments.</description>
