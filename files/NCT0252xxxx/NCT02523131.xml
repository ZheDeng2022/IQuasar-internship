      The main study objective is to determine whether day and night automated closed loop glucose&#xD;
      control combined with pump suspend feature will improve glucose control and reduce the burden&#xD;
      of hypoglycaemia compared to sensor augmented insulin pump therapy alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an open-label, multi-centre, multi-national, single-period, randomised, parallel&#xD;
      group design study, involving a three-month period of home study during which day and night&#xD;
      glucose levels will be controlled either by a closed loop system combined with pump suspend&#xD;
      feature (intervention group) or by sensor augmented insulin pump therapy (control group).&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is expected that up to 100 subjects, aiming for 84 randomised subjects [42 youth (6 to 21&#xD;
      years), and 42 adults (22 years and older)], with type 1 diabetes will be recruited through&#xD;
      paediatric and adult outpatient diabetes clinics in each of the investigation centres.&#xD;
      Subjects who drop out within the first four weeks of the intervention may be replaced.&#xD;
      Participants will all be on subcutaneous insulin pump therapy and will have proven&#xD;
      competencies both in the use of the study insulin pump and the study CGM device.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects in the intervention group will receive appropriate training in the safe use of&#xD;
      closed loop insulin delivery system and pump suspend feature. All subjects will have regular&#xD;
      contact with the study team during the home study phase including 24/7 telephone support. The&#xD;
      primary outcome is between group differences in the time spent in the target glucose range&#xD;
      from 3.9 to 10.0 mmol/l (70 to 180mg/dl) based on CGM glucose levels during the 12 week free&#xD;
      living phase. Secondary outcomes are HbA1 at the end of treatment period, the time spent with&#xD;
      glucose levels above and below target, as recorded by CGM, and other CGM-based metrics.&#xD;
      Safety evaluation comprises assessment of the frequency of severe hypoglycaemic episodes.&#xD;

      Purpose of the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine whether day and night automated closed loop glucose control combined with pump&#xD;
      suspend feature will improve glucose control as measured by glycated haemoglobin and reduce&#xD;
      the burden of hypoglycaemia compared to sensor augmented insulin pump therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. EFFICACY: The objective is to assess efficacy of day and night automated closed loop&#xD;
           glucose control combined with pump suspend feature in maintaining glucose levels within&#xD;
           the target range from 3.9 to 10.0mmol/l (70 to 180mg/dl) based on subcutaneous&#xD;
           continuous glucose monitoring (CGM), as compared to sensor augmented insulin pump&#xD;
           therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. SAFETY: The objective is to evaluate the safety of day and night automated closed loop&#xD;
           glucose control combined with pump suspend feature, in terms of episodes of severe&#xD;
           hypoglycaemia and other adverse events.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. UTILITY: The objective is to determine the frequency and duration of the use of the&#xD;
           automated closed loop system.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. PSYCHOSOCIAL: Subjects' and family members' perception in terms of life-style change,&#xD;
           diabetes management and fear of hypoglycaemia will be assessed using validated&#xD;
           questionnaires and semi-structured qualitative interviews. Cognitive functions will be&#xD;
           assessed using validated computerized cognitive tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      An open-label, multi-centre, multi-national, randomised, single-period, parallel group study,&#xD;
      contrasting day and night automated closed loop glucose control combined with pump suspend&#xD;
      feature with sensor augmented insulin pump therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
      Population:&#xD;
&#xD;
      84 participants randomised (42 youth and 42 adults). Each centre will aim to recruit between&#xD;
      05 and 20 participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Maximum duration of study for a subject :&#xD;
&#xD;
      18 weeks&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The subjects will be recruited through the paediatric and adult diabetes outpatient clinics&#xD;
      at each centre.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Consent:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Written consent/assent will be obtained from participants and/or guardians according to&#xD;
      REC/IRB requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening assessment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible participants will undergo a screening evaluation where blood samples for full blood&#xD;
      count, renal, liver, thyroid function and anti-transglutaminase antibodies with IgA levels&#xD;
      will be taken (if not done in the previous 3 months). Random C-peptide, glucose and HbA1c&#xD;
      will also be measured, and a urine pregnancy test in females of child-bearing potential.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Questionnaires investigating participants' quality of life, psychosocial functioning and&#xD;
      response to their current treatment will be distributed. Cognitive assessment will be made&#xD;
      using validated computerized cognitive tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Training:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Training sessions on the use of study CGM, insulin pump (and closed loop system for those&#xD;
      randomised to the intervention group) will be provided by the research team. Training session&#xD;
      on the use of real-time CGM and on how to interpret real-time and retrospective stored data&#xD;
      will be provided to all subjects/carers using written material.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Run-in Period:&#xD;
&#xD;
      During a 4 week run-in period, subjects will use study CGM and insulin pump. The research&#xD;
      team will contact subject once weekly during the run-in period, and subjects will also be&#xD;
      able to contact the research team for support and treatment optimisation as necessary. For&#xD;
      compliance and to assess the ability of the subject to use the CGM and study pump safely, at&#xD;
      least 12 days of CGM data need to be recorded and safe use of study insulin pump demonstrated&#xD;
      during the last 14 days of run-in period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Competency assessment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Competency on the use of study insulin pump and study CGM will be evaluated using a&#xD;
      competency assessment tool developed by the research team. Further training may be delivered&#xD;
      as required.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomisation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible subjects will be randomised using randomisation software to the use of real-time CGM&#xD;
      and pump suspend feature combined with day and night closed loop or to sensor augmented&#xD;
      insulin pump therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Automated day and night closed loop insulin delivery (intervention arm) combined with&#xD;
           pump suspend feature (interventional arm):&#xD;
&#xD;
           At the start, a blood sample will be taken for the measurement of HbA1c and a urine&#xD;
           pregnancy test in females of child-bearing potential.&#xD;
&#xD;
           A subset of participants will be interviewed to enable their historical diabetes&#xD;
           management practices, everyday work and family lives, and their initial expectations of&#xD;
           using closed loop technology to be captured and explored in-depth.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Subjects will be admitted to the clinical facility on Day 1. Training on the use of&#xD;
           closed loop and pump suspend feature will be provided by the research team. During the&#xD;
           next 2-4 hours patient will operate the system under the supervision of the clinical&#xD;
           team. Competency on the use of closed loop system will be evaluated. Subjects will use&#xD;
           closed loop and pump suspend feature for 12 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Sensor augmented insulin pump therapy (control arm):&#xD;
&#xD;
      A blood sample will be taken for the measurement of HbA1c and a urine pregnancy test in&#xD;
      females of child-bearing potential. Subjects will use sensor augmented insulin pump therapy&#xD;
      without pump suspend feature for 12 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      End of study assessments:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A blood sample will be taken for measurement of HbA1c.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Validated questionnaires evaluating the impact of the devices employed on life change,&#xD;
           diabetes management will be completed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cognitive assessment will be made using validated computerized cognitive tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Follow-up interviews will be undertaken with the subset of participants/family members&#xD;
           at the end of the closed loop intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedures for safety monitoring during trial:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Standard operating procedures for monitoring and reporting of all adverse events will be&#xD;
           in place, including serious adverse events (SAE), serious adverse device effects (SADE)&#xD;
           and specific adverse events (AE) such as severe hypoglycaemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Subjects will be asked to test and record blood or urine ketones if their finger prick&#xD;
           glucose is above 14.0mmol/l (250mg/dl) in the morning on waking, as part of the safety&#xD;
           assessment for hyperglycaemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A data safety and monitoring board (DSMB) will be informed of all serious adverse events&#xD;
           and any unanticipated serious adverse device effects that occur during the study and&#xD;
           will review compiled adverse event data at periodic intervals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Criteria for withdrawal of patients on safety grounds:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A subject, parent, or guardian may terminate participation in the study at any time without&#xD;
      necessarily giving a reason and without any personal disadvantage. An investigator can stop&#xD;
      the participation of a subject after consideration of the benefit/risk ratio. Possible&#xD;
      reasons are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Serious adverse events&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Significant protocol violation or non-compliance&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Failure to satisfy competency assessment&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Decision by the investigator, or the sponsor, that termination is in the subject's best&#xD;
           medical interest&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Pregnancy, planned pregnancy, or breast feeding&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Allergic reaction to insulin&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Technical grounds (e.g. subject relocates)&#xD;
