  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The American Diabetes Association (ADA), among other medical societies, is strongly&#xD;
      recommending medical nutrition therapy (MNT) for prevention and management of type 2&#xD;
      diabetes. However, the ADA recognized that there is no &quot;one size fits all&quot; diet and thus&#xD;
      recommends that MNT should be conducted through a consultation with registered dietitians&#xD;
      (RD). Previous studies have shown that using diabetes-specific nutritional formulas, as an&#xD;
      integral part of the MNT, lowers postprandial blood glucose levels. Through our experience&#xD;
      from the Joslin's Weight Achievement and Intensive Treatment (Why WAIT™) program, applying&#xD;
      MNT within a structured dietary intervention protocol has the best impact on blood glucose&#xD;
      values and body weight. Meanwhile, the frequent use of health coaching during dietary&#xD;
      intervention proved to be effective in managing diabetes and inducing weight loss. However,&#xD;
      no study compared those three intervention methods in a randomized clinical study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of different models of conducting medical&#xD;
      nutrition therapy on the glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes.&#xD;
