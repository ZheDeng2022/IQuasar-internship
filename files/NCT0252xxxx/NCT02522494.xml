  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Diabetes is common, it is expensive, and it is a chronic condition. Estimates put the&#xD;
      prevalence of diabetes at almost 20 percent in VA patients. Poorly controlled diabetes leads&#xD;
      to a number of complications including cardiovascular disease, blindness, amputation, and end&#xD;
      stage renal disease. Adherence to medication regimens (as well as lifestyle factors such as&#xD;
      diet and exercise) is important to achieve diabetes care goals. Adherence to recommended care&#xD;
      is related at least in part to effective communication in medical encounters. This project is&#xD;
      designed to test a video intervention to improve patients' communication behaviors. Providers&#xD;
      will also receive a pamphlet with specific recommendation to improve communication skills.&#xD;
      The project will assess the impact of the training programs on communication and outcomes.&#xD;
      The study is designed to help make patient care more patient-centered, which is one of the&#xD;
      six aims for improvement in the IOM Report, Crossing the Quality Chasm and is a goal of VA&#xD;
      transformation efforts.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Background: Clinical video telehealth (CVT) offers the opportunity for more efficient access&#xD;
      to high quality primary and specialist care for Veterans. Enthusiasm for CVT is especially&#xD;
      high in the VA given geographical separation between many Veterans and their providers at VA&#xD;
      Medical Centers. However, because CVT encounters are by nature less personal than in-person&#xD;
      visits, communication during CVT visits may be more challenging for both patients and&#xD;
      providers resulting in less patient-centered communication. Less personal visits may have&#xD;
      less exchange of information, lower satisfaction, less trust, and poorer outcomes. Indeed,&#xD;
      research comparing CVT with in-person consultations found that patients in CVT visits were&#xD;
      more passive and that CVT interactions were dominated by providers when compared with&#xD;
      in-person visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This project will leverage prior work from two HSR&amp;D-funded pilot projects to improve&#xD;
      provider - patient communication for Veterans with type 2 diabetes mellitus. In a short-term&#xD;
      project, SHP-08-182, the investigators conducted focus groups to elicit and understand&#xD;
      patients' barriers to communicating with their providers. This qualitative work was used in a&#xD;
      subsequent pilot project, PPO-08-402 to develop an educational video to encourage Veterans to&#xD;
      use active participatory communication in their visits to providers. This work was&#xD;
      successfully completed and the product is a 10-minute video that, in testing, was found to be&#xD;
      acceptable and feasible to show to VA patients immediately preceding their medical&#xD;
      encounters.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives: The investigators goal in this project is develop and test a video intervention&#xD;
      and to also develop pamphlets for patients and providers to encourage active and positive&#xD;
      communication in CVT medical interactions. The investigators goal was developed with and is&#xD;
      supported by the project's operational partner the Office of Telehealth Services and is&#xD;
      integral to the goal to ensure patient-centered care in new models of care. Patient-centered&#xD;
      communication in medical interactions is critical and plays an important, but often&#xD;
      overlooked, role in the delivery of health services.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are two aims. First, the investigators will develop educational interventions to&#xD;
      encourage patients and providers to use active communication behaviors during CVT visits.&#xD;
      Second, the investigators will conduct a randomized trial of the video and pamphlet&#xD;
      (intervention) vs. pamphlet alone (comparison) in a two-arm randomized effectiveness trial.&#xD;
      The investigators will evaluate for improvement in visit outcomes including patient and&#xD;
      provider measures of patient-centered care and communication, reduction in several common&#xD;
      barriers to clinical improvement, and improved medication adherence measures and hemoglobin&#xD;
      A1c. In addition, the investigators will assess the mediators and moderators of the&#xD;
      relationship of the intervention condition to outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: The project will have two phases. In the initial phase of the proposed project the&#xD;
      investigators will develop the video intervention. Video development will include qualitative&#xD;
      interviews with stakeholders and patients regarding CVT barriers and perceived benefits. The&#xD;
      investigators will use several existing resources and an expert panel of co-investigators and&#xD;
      consultants to bring these elements together and produce the intervention. In phase 2 the&#xD;
      investigators will conduct a randomized trial of the intervention, evaluating for improvement&#xD;
      in a number of outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Impacts: The educational tools will be deliverables that could be used prior to CVT visits to&#xD;
      improve communication and could serve as a paradigm for developing communication aids for&#xD;
      other medical conditions and other clinical settings. The investigators will evaluate whether&#xD;
      the educational intervention will help improve communication and will be associated with&#xD;
      better visit and intermediate outcomes. Educational tools that encourage more&#xD;
      patient-centered communication during CVT encounters may allow more rapid acceptance of CVT,&#xD;
      thereby improving access to healthcare and enhancing the operational mission of the project's&#xD;
      partner.&#xD;

    <time_frame>Post-intervention (interview within one week past CVT visit)</time_frame>
    <description>Consultation and Relational Empathy (CARE) Measure - is a tool for measuring patients' perceptions of relational empathy in the consultation. In this 10-item questionnaire patients rate the statements about their doctor's understanding their concern, showing care, and etc. during the recent CVT visit on a scale from 1 to 5 where 1 is &quot;poor&quot; and 5 is &quot;excellent&quot;. Scores can range from 10 to 50. The higher score means a better patient's perception of empathy in consultation.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Communication Ratings</measure>
    <time_frame>Post-intervention (interview within one week after CVT visit)</time_frame>
    <description>The questionnaire assesses patients' ratings of their own participatory communication behavior and patients' ratings of their providers' communication. It is a 15-item scale with 3 sub-scales. Patients' ratings of their (1) providers' informativeness and the extent to which the patient understands that information (information sub-scale) are measured with 5-items; (2) patients' ratings that the provider values and respects them is measured with 5-items; and (3) patients' ratings of their own communication is measured with 5-items. This questionnaire has high internal consistency. The scale is scored from 1 (completely disagree) to 7 (completely agree). The total scores range from 15 to 105. The higher scores indicate a better quality of communication.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Human Connection Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>At the baseline (Pre-CVT visit interview) and post-intervention (Post-CVT visit interview)</time_frame>
    <description>Human Connection Scale is a 15-item questionnaire that measures the extent to which patient feel a sense of mutual understanding, caring, and trust with their physicians. The scale is a valid and reliable measure of therapeutic alliance between patients and their physicians. The score from 1 to 4 is used where 1 is &quot;not at all&quot; and 4 is &quot;extremely&quot;. The scores range from 15 to 60. The higher scores indicate higher therapeutic alliance between patients and physicians.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Resistance to Treatment Questionnaire (RTQ)</measure>
    <time_frame>4 weeks past CVT visit</time_frame>
    <description>Resistance to Treatment Questionnaire (RTQ) identifies the reasons for resistance to treatment and its intensity among patients with diabetes. 20-item questionnaire consists of four themes (lack of faith or dissatisfaction, emotional reasons, specific problems, factors connected to despair or failure) containing 5 items each; each item is scored from 1 (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree). The scores range from 20 to 100. The higher scores mean more barriers to treatment (a worse outcome).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Trust in Provider Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>At the baseline (Pre-CVT visit interview) and post-intervention (interview within one week after CVT visit)</time_frame>
    <description>Trust in Provider is an important characteristic of provider-patient relationships and is assessed with a questionnaire. Trust is measured pre- and post-CVT visit using a 9-item measure. The scale is scored on a 7-point Likert scale using the anchors &quot;strongly disagree&quot; and &quot;strongly agree&quot;. The scores range from 9 to 63. The higher scores mean a better trust in provider.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Patient Satisfaction</measure>
    <time_frame>four weeks after CVT visit</time_frame>
    <description>Patient Satisfaction is assessed as the extent to which the patient is content with the relationship with her/his provider, in terms of the quality of information exchanged during medical encounters, and in terms of the demeanor of the provider toward the patient (courtesy, respectfulness, sensitivity, taking time and not being rushed). This is a 4-item survey, patient's satisfaction is scored from 1 (not at all satisfied) to 7 (extremely satisfied). The scores range from 5 to 35. The higher score indicates a better patient satisfaction.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Participatory Decision-Making</measure>
    <time_frame>At the baseline (Pre-CVT visit interview) and post-intervention (Post-CVT visit interview)</time_frame>
    <description>Participatory Decision-Making Style represents the degree to which providers involve patients in decision making. We measure patients' ratings of providers' participatory decision-making style using a 4-item scale evaluated by Heisler et al. in a study of veterans with diabetes. The authors found it to be associated with better patient understanding of diabetes and self-management practices. The survey scores how often provider involves patient in decision-making on a scale from 1 to 5, where 1 is &quot;none of the time&quot; and 5 is &quot;all of the time&quot;. Scores range from 4 to 20. Higher scores mean a better outcome.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Diabetes Self-Efficacy</measure>
    <time_frame>At the baseline (Pre-CVT visit interview) and post-intervention (interview within one week after CVT visit)</time_frame>
    <description>We used a 4-item scale to measure patients' confidence in their ability to manage their diabetes. The survey scores patients' perception of how well they can handle their diabetes on a scale from 1 to 7, where 1 is &quot;not at all true&quot; and 7 is &quot; very true&quot;. The scores range from 4 to 28. The higher score is validated as a predictor of better glycemic control. The higher scores mean a better confidence in managing diabetes.</description>

        <title>Communication Self-efficacy</title>
        <description>Communication Self-Efficacy (pre and post visit) is the degree to which a patient feels able to interact with his/her provider in order to provide information about problems, obtain desired information about diagnosis, treatment and prognosis, and participate in formulating a plan. The Perceived Efficacy in Physician-Patient Interactions scale (PEPPI) is a valid and reliable measure of patients' perceived self-efficacy in interacting with physicians (alpha 0.83). The short form of the PEPPI (PEPPI-5) has 5-items. Score on the PEPPI-5 ranges from 5-25. Higher scores reflect a better perceived self-efficacy in interacting with physicians.</description>

          <title>Communication Self-efficacy</title>
          <description>Communication Self-Efficacy (pre and post visit) is the degree to which a patient feels able to interact with his/her provider in order to provide information about problems, obtain desired information about diagnosis, treatment and prognosis, and participate in formulating a plan. The Perceived Efficacy in Physician-Patient Interactions scale (PEPPI) is a valid and reliable measure of patients' perceived self-efficacy in interacting with physicians (alpha 0.83). The short form of the PEPPI (PEPPI-5) has 5-items. Score on the PEPPI-5 ranges from 5-25. Higher scores reflect a better perceived self-efficacy in interacting with physicians.</description>

        <title>Resistance to Treatment Questionnaire (RTQ)</title>
        <description>Resistance to Treatment Questionnaire (RTQ) identifies the reasons for resistance to treatment and its intensity among patients with diabetes. 20-item questionnaire consists of four themes (lack of faith or dissatisfaction, emotional reasons, specific problems, factors connected to despair or failure) containing 5 items each; each item is scored from 1 (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree). The scores range from 20 to 100. The higher scores mean more barriers to treatment (a worse outcome).</description>

We measure patients' ratings of providers' participatory decision-making style using a 4-item scale evaluated by Heisler et al. in a study of veterans with diabetes. The authors found it to be associated with better patient understanding of diabetes and self-management practices. The survey scores how often provider involves patient in decision-making on a scale from 1 to 5, where 1 is &quot;none of the time&quot; and 5 is &quot;all of the time&quot;. Scores range from 4 to 20. Higher scores mean a better outcome.</description>
