      Observational non-randomized study with an intervention cohort from Hospital&#xD;
      Galdakao-Usansolo with 119 patients and a control cohort from Hospital Cruces with 78&#xD;
      patients. The inclusion criteria were: being hospital admitted at least twice in the previous&#xD;
      year or at least three times in the 2 previous years. The cohorts were follow-up for 2 years.&#xD;
      Several clinical measurements like pulmonary function, exercise capacity, health related&#xD;
      quality of life, limitation in daily life activities and anxiety and depression were recorded&#xD;
      in both cohorts. Telemonitoring and an organized education program were only and exclusively&#xD;
      applied in the intervention cohort.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      During July 2010 and July 2013 COPD patients from two health-administrative areas (integrated&#xD;
      sanitary organization -ISO-) in Bizkaia were recruited. Each of these two areas is supported&#xD;
      by 1 hospital. Hospital Galdakao-Usansolo hospital (ISO-Barrualde), which is in charge of the&#xD;
      health of 350000 inhabitants and in the second, hospital Cruces (OSI-Ezkerraldea Cruces) with&#xD;
      350000 inhabitants. The cohort from Galdakao was the intervention cohort while the cohort&#xD;
      from Cruces was the control cohort. Both cohorts were followed-up for two years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants The inclusion criteria established were: having a COPD (COPD was confirmed if&#xD;
      the post-bronchodilator forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) divided by the forced&#xD;
      vital capacity (FVC) was less than 0.7 (FEV1/FVC&lt;70%) and having been admitted at least twice&#xD;
      in the previous year or three times in the two previous years for a COPD exacerbation&#xD;
      (eCOPD). Exclusion criteria were another significant respiratory disease, an active neoplasm,&#xD;
      a terminal clinical situation, inability to carry out any of the measurements of the project,&#xD;
      or unwillingness to take part in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With these requirements, patients were chosen from the database of the hospital. The&#xD;
      potential candidates and their career were informed about the program in a general&#xD;
      informative meeting, or individually during an admission, and invited to participate. If the&#xD;
      patient wanted to take part in the program they signed the informed consent form.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Usual clinical care At the time of this study COPD patients had no take part in any specific&#xD;
      clinical control program in the public health system. Patients were being controlled&#xD;
      following a schedule by their primary doctor and respiratory specialist. The frequency of the&#xD;
      control depended on the severity of the disease. In case of eCOPD they had to schedule a&#xD;
      visit to their primary doctor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention The patients had to present a stable COPD, at least for six weeks before&#xD;
      enrollment. All the participants had a previous spirometry but COPD diagnosis was confirmed&#xD;
      at the moment of inclusion in the program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The program consisted of: 1) Educational program about COPD (general information about what&#xD;
      COPD is, general treatment of the disease focusing on tobacco and inhaled medication, life&#xD;
      healthy habits and alarm signs related to eCOPD). This educational program was carried-out by&#xD;
      a respiratory nurse in two 30-minute speeches to the patient and career, once at their&#xD;
      inclusion in the program and again 1 year later. 2) Training in using the device (smart&#xD;
      phone) that supported the telemonitoring. 3) Daily phone calls to make self-confident the&#xD;
      patient during the first week. Afterwards the phone calls were established according to the&#xD;
      capacity of the patient to manage on their own.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Generally speaking during the two years of the program in every phone call patients were&#xD;
      given some advice on daily healthy habits, specially physical activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Written information about how the program ran and how to use the smart phone as well as a&#xD;
      contact phone number was provided to every patient and career.&#xD;
&#xD;
      No home visits were part of the program. No self-management plans of exacerbation were&#xD;
      included in the program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The implementation of this program was previously explained to all the primary doctors in two&#xD;
      general meetings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The program was supported by a specialized respiratory nurse, working in the hospital&#xD;
      Galdakao-Usansolo as a full timer and two part-time respiratory physicians working on the&#xD;
      program from Monday to Friday. During the evening and at the weekends a centralized&#xD;
      call-center (non specialized respiratory nurses) was in charge of the program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The device was a smart phone with a specific software for the program, including some&#xD;
      measurements of physiological variables such as temperature, breath rate, oxygen saturation,&#xD;
      heart rate and steps/day) and a clinical questionnaire (characteristics of cough and sputum,&#xD;
      level of dyspnea and general clinical health status).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients included in the program (telEPOC program) had to send information about their&#xD;
      clinical situation on a daily basis. This daily information was sent by a secure internet&#xD;
      connection to protect server and transfer to the respiratory service, where a nurse analyzed&#xD;
      the whole information of every patient. Every patient had a tailored-made baseline level of&#xD;
      these measurements established in a stable clinical situation at the moment of inclusion in&#xD;
      the program. This baseline was the reference for the daily measurements. Once the patientÂ´s&#xD;
      measurements were received, were automatically ordered in three colored levels (traffic&#xD;
      lights) depending of the deviation of the measurement with respect the baseline measurement&#xD;
      (alarm). The alarm three levels was established by consensus of the research team depending&#xD;
      on the different combination of measurement daily sent by the patients. Once the patient&#xD;
      measurements were received, there were several possible actions. If all the data were normal&#xD;
      with respect to the personalized threshold previously established, not a single action was&#xD;
      done. If the established threshold was surpassed, an alarm was activated and an protocol&#xD;
      action plan was started up. The first step was a phone call to the patient or the career.&#xD;
      This phone call was used to confirm the alarm and its level of priority and try to solve it&#xD;
      as long as it was possible. If this action was not considered useful or did not solve the&#xD;
      alarm the nurse had two options, depending on the severity of the alarm, wait for the daily&#xD;
      evaluation of the patient bi respiratory physicians (ward daily rounds) or contact one of the&#xD;
      respiratory physicians. At this point it was the respiratory physician who determined if the&#xD;
      patient should be sent to his primary doctor or be evaluated by a respiratory specialist or&#xD;
      sent to the hospital emergency department.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If a patient had to be evaluated by a doctor at the primary level or at a specialized level,&#xD;
      the nurse of the program previously contact the doctor to arrange an appointment. An alert&#xD;
      system warned the monitoring team if daily measurements had not been submitted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary outcome: The primary outcome of the program was to diminish the rate of&#xD;
      hospitalizations for eCOPD. We defined an exacerbation as a sustained worsening of the&#xD;
      participant's COPD symptoms from their usual stable state that was beyond normal day-to-day&#xD;
      variations, and with a severity level that need hospital admission to be solved.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Control cohort. The control group follows the usual care protocol in our health system. That&#xD;
      includes periodic control by their primary and respiratory specialist. They receive&#xD;
      non-structured information/education about COPD and follow a programmed control agenda&#xD;
      depending on the severity of the disease every 4-6 months. Generally speaking the differences&#xD;
      between the two cohorts were the educational structured program and the telemonitoring&#xD;
      control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline assessment The study protocol performed in the intervention and in the control&#xD;
      cohort included several measurements before being included in the program and every year&#xD;
      during the follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sociodemographic variables and smoking habits were recorded. The level of dyspnea was&#xD;
      established using modified Medical Research Council score [10]. Comorbidities were determined&#xD;
      by reviewing patients' medical records for their clinical histories and Charlson Comorbidity&#xD;
      Index calculates. Health related quality of life (HRQoL) was assessed using the Spanish&#xD;
      validated version of Saint George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) and the COPD Assessment&#xD;
      Test (CAT). London Chest Activity of Daily Living scale questionnaire (LCADL). Anxiety and&#xD;
      Depression were measured by Hospital Anxiety and Depression (HAD) scale .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Complete pulmonary function tests included forced spirometry, bronchodilator test, body&#xD;
      plethysmography, carbon monoxide diffusing capacity, respiratory muscle strength. Theoretical&#xD;
      values were those established by the European Community for Steel and Coal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two 6-minute walking tests were performed according to American Thoracic Society (ATS)&#xD;
      guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intervention group daily used a pedometer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up In the control cohort every year during the follow-up period, survivors were&#xD;
      interviewed and underwent the previously described measurements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      No others interventions were performed related to this study, and the research team did not&#xD;
      take part in patients' routine treatment or the treatment of exacerbations. In every visit,&#xD;
      reviewing medical reports and examining the hospital database hospitalizations were&#xD;
      determined.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection Data about hospitalizations and emergency department admission were collected&#xD;
      in real time because the patients were trained to notify these circumstances and the daily&#xD;
      follow-up permitted to know the situation of every patient in every moment. Moreover if a&#xD;
      patient did not send the daily data the system generated an alarm resulting in a phone call&#xD;
      from the nurse to know the reason why the information had not been sent. Besides, in every&#xD;
      patient a review of hospital and emergency department admission was carried out at the end of&#xD;
      every year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The questionnaires and pulmonary function test and exercise capacity were performed every&#xD;
      year.&#xD;

        <title>Number of Hospitalizations for COPD Exacerbation (eCOPD)</title>
        <description>The primary outcome of the program was to diminish the rate of hospitalizations for eCOPD. We defined an exacerbation as a sustained worsening of the participant's COPD symptoms from their usual stable state that was beyond normal day-to-day variations, and with a severity level that need hospital admission to be solved.</description>

            <description>The program consisted of: 1) Educational program about COPD. This educational program was carried-out by a respiratory nurse in two 30-minute speeches to the patient and career, once at their inclusion in the program and again 1 year later. 2) Training in using the device (smart phone) that supported the telemonitoring. 3) Daily phone calls to make self-confident the patient during the first week. Afterwards the phone calls were established according to the capacity of the patient to manage on their own.</description>

            <description>The control group follows the usual care protocol in our health system. That includes periodic control by their primary and respiratory specialist. They receive non-structured information/education about COPD and follow a programmed control agenda depending on the severity of the disease every 4-6 months.&#xD;
Generally speaking the differences between the two cohorts were the educational structured program and the telemonitoring control.</description>
