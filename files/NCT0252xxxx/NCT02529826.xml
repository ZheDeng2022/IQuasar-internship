  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Due to remarkable advances in cancer treatments, the investigators are witnessing a growing&#xD;
      population of long-term survivors of childhood malignancies. However, fertility in adult life&#xD;
      may be severely impaired by gonadotoxic therapies. Since prepubertal boys cannot produce&#xD;
      spermatozoa, banking of testicular tissue prior to gonadotoxic treatment is a crucial step&#xD;
      towards fertility preservation for this population. Several centers around the world are now&#xD;
      cryopreserving testicular tissue for prepubertal boys in anticipation that future&#xD;
      technologies will allow the utilization of the banked samples for fertility restoration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Testicular tissue cryopreservation has now emerged as the leading strategy for fertility&#xD;
      preservation in prepubertal boys before gonadotoxic treatments. Fertility restoration can&#xD;
      theoretically be obtained after allo-transplantation of testicular tissue fragments that&#xD;
      preserve both the SSCs and the supporting microenvironment (spermatogonial stem-cell niche).&#xD;

    <textblock>
      As treatment regimens for pediatric oncologic malignancies have improved, more and more&#xD;
      survivors are entering their reproductive years. Since gonadal damage is a relatively common&#xD;
      and unfortunate consequence of the treatments used to cure pediatric cancer as well as&#xD;
      certain hematological conditions and immunodeficiencies, maintenance of fertility is&#xD;
      extremely important with regard to long-term quality of life for these survivors.&#xD;
      Consideration must be given to whether a child's fertility is likely to be impacted by his or&#xD;
      her treatment. Ideally, this should occur before the start of therapy, when a window of&#xD;
      opportunity may exist to preserve the patient's future reproductive potential. Developments&#xD;
      in the area of sperm banking and reproductive technologies have made it possible to offer&#xD;
      viable options to preserve fertility to pubertal males undergoing cancer therapy. Pubertal&#xD;
      males can produce a semen sample prior to starting gonadotoxic therapy and cryopreserve the&#xD;
      sperm for future use. Because current methods of oocyte fertilization can utilize as few as&#xD;
      one motile sperm, this method has proven to be successful even when the number of sperm,&#xD;
      which are frozen, is small. Unfortunately, prepubertal males pose a particular challenge for&#xD;
      fertility preservation. These boys cannot produce semen for cryopreservation by masturbation.&#xD;
      They also do not have mature spermatozoa. Although the prepubertal testis does not produce&#xD;
      mature spermatozoa, it does contain the diploid stem-germ cells from which haploid&#xD;
      spermatozoa will be derived. For these at risk prepubertal boys, as well as for pubertal boys&#xD;
      who may not be able to sperm bank, a recent and encouraging approach is the use of&#xD;
      cryopreserved testicular tissue. While important strides have been made in animal research in&#xD;
      this area, the use of testicular tissue cryopreservation in humans remains experimental. If&#xD;
      prepubertal testicular tissue could be acquired and banked before starting gonadotoxic&#xD;
      therapy, this tissue could then be thawed and the stored germ cells reimplanted into the&#xD;
      patient's own testes, a procedure known as germ-cell transplantation. Alternatively, the&#xD;
      stored cells could be matured in vitro until they can achieve fertilization by use of&#xD;
      intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research with animal models has demonstrated that there are several methods to use germ cells&#xD;
      to obtain mature spermatozoa for fertilization including autotransplantation, and&#xD;
      xenotransplantation. Autotransplantation is considered more acceptable than&#xD;
      xenotransplantation, although both have been successful in mouse models. In rodents,&#xD;
      autotransplantation has resulted in restored spermatogenesis and mice have reproduced in&#xD;
      vivo. Investigators have demonstrated that microinjecting a crude suspension of germ cells&#xD;
      into mice rendered sterile can restore spermatogenesis and fertility. Similar success has&#xD;
      been reported in rats and larger mammals. Restoration of spermatogenesis is also possible&#xD;
      with cryopreserved cells. It has been estimated that 70% of spermatogonial cells can survive&#xD;
      after freezing and thawing. Malignant contamination remains one of the main concerns&#xD;
      surrounding transplantation, though the few studies that address this issue are controversial&#xD;
      in their findings. Progress in addressing this question has been made in mouse models,&#xD;
      particularly with the use of fluorescence-activated cell sorting to negatively sort malignant&#xD;
      cells from cell suspensions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Because cryopreservation and transplantation of SSCs is currently successful in animals,&#xD;
      application in humans seems likely in the near future. The possibility of infertility is an&#xD;
      issue many families need to grapple with as they agree to initiate chemotherapy on their&#xD;
      sons. Since this method requires testicular biopsies, both parental desire and the&#xD;
      acceptability of SSC collection are important to assess. Recently, researchers interviewed&#xD;
      318 parents regarding their acceptance of such an idea. They asked parents to think&#xD;
      hypothetically about the following scenario, &quot;If there was an experimental procedure&#xD;
      available at diagnosis, would you allow your sons to undergo a testicular biopsy in an&#xD;
      attempt to collect SSCs?&quot; At diagnosis, SSC collection by means of testicular biopsy was&#xD;
      theoretically approved by 61% of these parents. They also observed that the desire to&#xD;
      cryopreserve SSCs was not related to potential harmfulness of the oncological treatment,&#xD;
      indicating that even a minor chance of infertility was considered as a major burden in&#xD;
      respect to the ultimate quality of life. These data indicate that the translation of current&#xD;
      animal experiments on SSC collection and transplantation into clinical care is desired by&#xD;
      parents from prepubertal boys with cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a novel, experimental protocol that requires collaborations between clinicians and&#xD;
      basic scientists. There are several key clinical and translational points that have to be&#xD;
      considered, including the beliefs and concerns of parents and prepubertal boys with cancer,&#xD;
      the ability to perform a testicular biopsy adequately without negative sequelae, as well as&#xD;
      tissue storage for fertility and research purposes, notably the viability of biopsy samples&#xD;
      for downstream in vitro and functional genomics studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goal of the present proposal is to develop clinical, translational, and basic science&#xD;
      initiatives which will allow for an extensive, dedicated program for the acquisition and&#xD;
      storage of testicular tissue from prepubertal males seen at Hadassah Medical center as well&#xD;
      as at collaborating institutions in Israel and across the world. Developing the means for&#xD;
      tissue distribution and handling as well as long-term tissue storage are critical components,&#xD;
      especially since testicular tissue might be decades in storage prior to use in a fertility&#xD;
      setting. Most importantly, a cryopreservation protocol for human testicular tissue has to be&#xD;
      developed de novo for this initiative to ultimately become a standard option for fertility&#xD;
      preservation for prepubertal males with cancer as well as for those with blood diseases or&#xD;
      immunodeficiency who will be undergoing stem cell transplant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An open testicular biopsy will be performed by an attending urologist (effort will be made to&#xD;
      perform the procedure concurrently during a procedure when the patient is under general&#xD;
      anesthesia for another purpose, i.e. central line placement, bone marrow aspirates/biopsies).&#xD;
      This procedure will occur before any gonadotoxic therapy is initiated. Nevertheless, in cases&#xD;
      of emergent chemotherapy treatment, the procedure may be done after chemotherapy since the&#xD;
      toxicity for testicular stem cells is not known. A 10 mm incision is made in the superior&#xD;
      pole of the testis and an approximately 5% portion of the extruded seminiferous tubules is&#xD;
      excised (about 2 mm x 4 mm x 10 mm; approximately 1 gram of tissue). This is the size of a&#xD;
      normal testis biopsy done for clinical reasons such as evaluation for cancer. In infants or&#xD;
      very young boys the size of the incision and the biopsy is under the discretion of the&#xD;
      urologist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Testicular biopsy specimens will be divided immediately on the operating table. Two thirds of&#xD;
      the specimen (termed Specimen #1) will be cryopreserved in Sperm Wash Media for potential use&#xD;
      by the patient at a later date. A freezing protocol (slow freezing) currently in place for&#xD;
      adult human testicular tissue cryopreservation will be implemented for the current proposal,&#xD;
      and has been published in the literature for use with prepubertal testicular tissue.&#xD;
      Specifically, 0.7 M dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) is used as a cryoprotective agent. Specimen #1&#xD;
      of the biopsy will have the patient's name, date of birth, current date, and medical record&#xD;
      number attached. A separate sheet will also be sent with the specimen who will include phone&#xD;
      number and current address. These specimens will stay at the sperm bank of Hadassah Medical&#xD;
      Center.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As stated above, the other third of specimen will be used for research purposes in an effort&#xD;
      to advance the science of isolating and culturing human SSCs for fertility research. These&#xD;
      portions will be stripped of all personal health identifiers at the time of division and a&#xD;
      unique identifying code will be assigned.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The risks of this study pertain to the testicular biopsy. The side effects from this&#xD;
      procedure are mild. Pain related to the procedure is expected and is easily controlled with&#xD;
      mild to moderate analgesic medications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The benefit is that the patient may be able to use the frozen testicular biopsy tissue and/or&#xD;
      cultured SSC's derived from the biopsy to preserve their fertility in the future. At this&#xD;
      time, however, it is imperative to note that this procedure is purely experimental. The time&#xD;
      frame for this study is defined from the date of recruitment until the date of clinical&#xD;
      utilization of the cryopreserved tissue for fertility restoration up to forty years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will collect any adverse outcomes, which occur during (intra-operatively) or after the&#xD;
      testicular biopsy including pain, bleeding and/or infection. Events will be tracked and&#xD;
      recorded for one week after the procedure, a time frame well beyond the 2-3 day recovery time&#xD;
      that is associated with this type of biopsy. Events clearly related to the subject's cancer&#xD;
      or cancer treatment and not specifically to the testicular biopsy will not be&#xD;
      collected/reported.&#xD;
