      This research study is studying a chemotherapy drug Lenalidomide as a possible treatment for&#xD;
      one of three histiocyte disorders: Langerhans cell histiocytosis (LCH), Erdheim-Chester&#xD;
      disease (ECD), or histiocytic sarcoma (HS).&#xD;

      This research study is a Phase II clinical trial. Phase II clinical trials test the safety&#xD;
      and effectiveness of an investigational intervention to learn whether the intervention works&#xD;
      in treating a specific disease. &quot;Investigational&quot; means that the intervention is being&#xD;
      studied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has not approved lenalidomide for your&#xD;
      specific disease but it has been approved for other uses. Lenalidomide is a chemotherapy drug&#xD;
      that belongs to a class of drugs called immunomodulatory drugs (IMiDs), which modify a&#xD;
      participant's immune response in order to treat cancer. Lenalidomide alters the body's immune&#xD;
      system and it may also interfere with the development of tiny blood vessels that help support&#xD;
      tumor growth. Therefore, it may reduce or prevent the growth of cancer cells. Lenalidomide&#xD;
      has been shown to restore the immune cells' ability to attack and kill tumor cells&#xD;
      Lenalidomide is approved by the FDA to treat certain cancers including multiple myeloma and&#xD;
      myelodysplastic syndrome.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have histologically or cytologically confirmed LCH, ECD or HS.&#xD;
             Confirmation of outside pathology at BWH will be performed but is not mandatory prior&#xD;
             to study enrollment (see section 3).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Detectable disease by at least one of the following modalities: CT, PET, bone scan, or&#xD;
             MRI.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with LCH must require systemic therapy according to the Histiocyte Society&#xD;
             LCH Evaluation and Treatment Guidelines (HS 2009)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -- Or&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with HS requiring systemic treatment as defined by disease that cannot be&#xD;
             surgically resected and/or encompassed in a single radiation field.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age 18 years or older.&#xD;

&#xD;
               -  platelets ≥100,000/mcL&#xD;

&#xD;
               -  creatinine within 2 times normal institutional limits&#xD;
&#xD;
                  --- OR&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  creatinine clearance ≥30 mL/min/1.73 m2. Note, dose adjustments are required for&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Able to take aspirin 81 mg daily as prophylactic anticoagulation if not on warfarin,&#xD;
             low molecular weight heparin or oral factor Xa inhibitor. Patients intolerant to ASA&#xD;
             may use warfarin or low molecular weight heparin at doses designed to treat deep&#xD;
             venous thrombosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  All study participants must be registered into the mandatory Revlimid REMS® program,&#xD;
             and be willing and able to comply with the requirements of the REMS® program.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Women of child-bearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception&#xD;
             (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry and for&#xD;
             the duration of study participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prior chemotherapy or radiation within 2 weeks (6 weeks for nitrosoureas or mitomycin&#xD;
             C) prior to entering the study or those who have not recovered from adverse events due&#xD;
             to agents administered more than 2 weeks earlier.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants who are receiving any other investigational agents.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prior treatment with lenalidomide. Patients previously treated with thalidomide who&#xD;
             discontinued treatment for reasons aside from an adverse reaction to thalidomide are&#xD;
             permitted.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of another invasive malignancy unless treated with curative intent 5 years or&#xD;
             more prior to study entry. Patients with localized carcinoma of the cervix,&#xD;
             non-melanoma skin cancer, or early stage prostate cancer requiring observation only&#xD;
             are eligible regardless of timing of diagnosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active&#xD;
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac&#xD;
             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with&#xD;
             study requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because lenalidomide has known teratogenic&#xD;
             effects. Because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing&#xD;
             infants secondary to treatment of the mother with lenalidomide, breastfeeding should&#xD;
             be discontinued if the mother is treated with lenalidomide.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Known active hepatitis B (HBV) or hepatitis C (HCV) infection. Patients who are&#xD;
             positive only for HBV surface antibody as a result of prior vaccination are eligible.&#xD;
             Patients with a positive HBV core antibody but undetectable HBV viral load are&#xD;
             eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  HIV-positive participants on combination antiretroviral therapy are ineligible because&#xD;
             of the potential for pharmacokinetic interactions with lenalidomide. In addition,&#xD;
             these participants are at increased risk of lethal infections when treated with&#xD;
             marrow-suppressive therapy. Appropriate studies will be undertaken in participants&#xD;
             receiving combination antiretroviral therapy when indicated.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Concomitant corticosteroids unless patient has been on a stable dose of prednisone (or&#xD;
             equivalent) of ≤10 mg daily for at least 2 weeks prior to first dose of study drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Inability to swallow pills.&#xD;
