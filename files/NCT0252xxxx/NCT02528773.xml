  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators are conducting a study to learn more about the spread of HIV infection&#xD;
      within different geographic regions and populations in San Diego County, with the goal of&#xD;
      demonstrating that early use of HIV treatment can reduce the number of new infections in our&#xD;
      community. At the study visits, participants will be examined by the study staff and asked to&#xD;
      donate some blood. Participants will also be asked several questions about themselves, their&#xD;
      background, behaviors, health, and the general geographic area in which they live. By&#xD;
      collecting information about antiretroviral treatment choices that are made by study&#xD;
      participants, the investigators will be better able to measure how effectively HIV treatment&#xD;
      can interrupt (i.e., block) the spread of HIV. All of the information gathered at the study&#xD;
      visits will be de-identified and analyzed. Study staff will use the information to better&#xD;
      understand in which groups of people, and in what areas of San Diego, HIV is spreading most&#xD;
      quickly. This information will be used to determine how well Antiretroviral Therapy (HIV&#xD;
      treatment) by certain individuals can control the spread of HIV within the population.&#xD;

      Blood Draws: Approximately 2 tablespoons (30 mL) of blood will be taken for blood tests and&#xD;
      storage at each visit. Participants' blood will be tested for:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  CD4+/CD8+ T-cell Count. This is a measure of the immune system; T-cells help the immune&#xD;
           system fight infections.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  HIV-1 RNA (Viral Load). This measures the amount of HIV in the blood.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  HIV pol sequence. This measures the type of HIV in your blood.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood will be collected for storage for future HIV testing, studies to measure the&#xD;
           amount of residual HIV that remains in people who are doing well on HIV treatment,&#xD;
           genetic testing of the HIV virus and possible HLA genotype testing as determined by the&#xD;
           results of this and future studies.&#xD;
