  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main purpose of this study is to assess clemastine as a remyelinating agent in patients&#xD;
      with acute optic neuritis.The study will also evaluate the tolerability of clemastine,&#xD;
      originally approved as first-generation antihistamine, in patients with optic neuritis. Study&#xD;
      procedures will include assessments for evidence of remyelination in the anterior visual&#xD;
      pathway and in the brain using electrophysiologic techniques and magnetic resonance imaging.&#xD;
      If they are on one, patients in this study can remain on their standard disease modifying&#xD;
      treatment during the course of the study. However, patients cannot participate in any other&#xD;
      investigational new drug research study concurrently.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Optic neuritis is an inflammatory, demyelinating disease of the optic nerve. It is most often&#xD;
      characterized by visual loss or blurred vision along with dyschromatopsiaaccompanied by pain&#xD;
      (especially with eye movement) and no demonstrable evidence of an alternate diagnosis such as&#xD;
      ischemia or retinal disease. It can also be associated with a swollen optic disc (Optic&#xD;
      Neuritis Study Group 1991, Hutchinson, W.M. 1976) and optic nerve enhancement on MRI&#xD;
      (Kupersmith 2002).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Functional high-throughput screening for compounds that promote remyelination presents a&#xD;
      major unmet need in the therapeutic arsenal for multiple sclerosis and other demyelinating&#xD;
      conditions such as optic neuritis. Screening for myelin repair is problematic, as functional&#xD;
      remyelination requires the presence of intact neuronal axons. Standard methods are not suited&#xD;
      for high-throughput formats. We performed a detailed screen of over 1500 FDA approved small&#xD;
      molecule drugs to identify agents that could be promising for remyelination. Engineered with&#xD;
      conical dimensions, our micropillar technology permitted resolution of the extent and length&#xD;
      of membrane wrapping from a single 2-dimensional image. Confocal imaging acquired from the&#xD;
      base to the tip of the pillars allows for the fluorescence detection of concentric wrapping&#xD;
      observed as &quot;rings&quot; of myelin membrane. The platform was formatted in 96-well plates,&#xD;
      amenable to semi-automated random acquisition and automated detection and quantification.&#xD;
      Upon initiating a screen of 1500 bioactive molecules, we identified Clemastine as a compound&#xD;
      that potentially enhances oligodendrocyte differentiation and remyelination. We then&#xD;
      validated this and other drugs in preclinical assays as well as in animal models of primary&#xD;
      myelination and remyelination after inflammatory and chemical demyelination. Together, our&#xD;
      findings illustrate the proof of concept for a novel high-throughput screening platform for&#xD;
      potential regenerative therapeutics in MS (Chan JR et al. 2014).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is intended to assess for clinical evidence of remyelination using Clemastine&#xD;
      Fumarate in patients with acute inflammatory injury causing demyelination of the anterior&#xD;
      visual pathway as a consequence of acute demyelinating optic neuritis. The study is designed&#xD;
      to assess tolerability and clinical efficacy of Clemastine using outcomes intended to assess&#xD;
      for (a) adverse events and (b) recovery of myelin. This study is complementary to an earlier&#xD;
      study evaluating clemastine in chronic demyelinated optic neuropathy and serves as part of a&#xD;
      proof of concept program intended to evaluate methods for conducting remyelination trials in&#xD;
      MS.&#xD;

    <description>To evaluate the efficacy of Clemastine relative to placebo in reducing the EDSS score at 9 months.The EDSS is an ordinal scale used for assessing neurological impairment of MS based on a neurological examination. It consists of scores in each of seven functional systems (FS) and an ambulation score that are then combined to determine the EDSS [ranging from 0 (normal) to 10 (death due to MS)]. The FSs are the Visual, Brain Stem, Pyramidal, Cerebellar, Sensory, Bowel &amp; Bladder, and Cerebral functions. The FSs and EDSS steps will be assessed in a standardized manner. EDSS is a widely used and accepted instrument to evaluate disability status at a given time and longitudinally, to assess disability progression in clinical studies in MS.</description>
