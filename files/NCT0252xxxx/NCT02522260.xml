    <textblock>
      This study on women with breast cancer during and after chemo- and hormonal therapy compares&#xD;
      the effect of different physical training programs on physical and mental well-being and&#xD;
      systemic inflammation mechanisms in blood. In a sub-group of participants, mitochondrial&#xD;
      biogenesis and function and other molecular processes in skeletal muscle biopsies are&#xD;
      studied. The women will be randomly allocated into three different intervention arms, a&#xD;
      control arm with usual care and two different training arms. All participants will respond to&#xD;
      questionnaires and have blood samples and taken and for a subgroup muscle biopsies before and&#xD;
      after the exercise intervention. Participants will be supported to uphold exercise through&#xD;
      collaboration with Friskis &amp; Svettis and followed for 5 years. Some of the women will also be&#xD;
      asked to participate in an in depth interview about the experiences of exercise during&#xD;
      ongoing treatment. This study will contribute to increased knowledge about the type,&#xD;
      intensity and frequency of training that patients with breast cancer benefit most from with&#xD;
      regards to impact on physical and mental wellbeing. This knowledge is of great importance&#xD;
      since experience shows that patients and relatives often seek information about&#xD;
      rehabilitation, self-care and physical activity. The study will also contribute to the&#xD;
      improvement of the patients´ quality of life, ability to return to work, and reduce social&#xD;
      costs, but above all, increase the possibility for development and implementation of&#xD;
      evidence-based rehabilitation of women with breast cancer during and after active treatment.&#xD;

      Purpose The main aim is to, in women undergoing chemotherapy for breast cancer, explore how&#xD;
      different training interventions impact physical capacity and psychological well being.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research questions&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Does PA improve the ability to return to work after breast cancer treatment is&#xD;
           completed?&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  How do women with breast cancer during chemotherapy treatment respond to controlled and&#xD;
           supervised aerobic fitness training and a combination of aerobic fitness training and&#xD;
           strength training in physiological, structural and molecular outcome measures such as&#xD;
           muscular strength, aerobic fitness, muscle mass, mitochondrial density, gene activity in&#xD;
           muscle and B-Hb, s-CRP and other blood variables,?&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Is there a difference between the women in the aerobic exercise training group, the&#xD;
           combined aerobic and strength-training group and the control group regarding symptom&#xD;
           distress and health related quality of life?&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Are there any effects of exercise training on chemotherapy completion and&#xD;
           hospitalization rates?&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Is adherence to physical exercise impacted by the individuals' personality?&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Are there any remaining effects of the physical exercise intervention, on&#xD;
           cardiotoxicity, cognitive function, survival and morbidity, up to 5 years after&#xD;
           treatment is completed?&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Is the intervention cost-effective?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design and methods Participants A total of 240 women will be recruited from the&#xD;
      Department of Oncology Breast and Sarcoma units at Radiumhemmet and Södersjukhuset,&#xD;
      Karolinska University Hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria: patients up to 70 years with breast cancer Stage I-IIIa before the start&#xD;
      of chemotherapy. Exclusion criteria: patients with advanced disease, patients where physical&#xD;
      activity is considered contraindicated because of medical reasons such as heart or lung&#xD;
      disease, brain or bone metastases, cognitive dysfunction, and patients who do not speak or&#xD;
      understand the Swedish language.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization The Clinical Trials Unit (KPE) at Radiumhemmet, Karolinska&#xD;
      Universitetssjukhuset, conducts inclusion to the study and randomization. The participants&#xD;
      are allocated to either two different training groups or a control group. The participants&#xD;
      are also randomized to a muscle biopsy (n=45) before and after the intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 1) includes strength training of the large muscle groups (2-3 sets, 8-12 repetitions on&#xD;
      an intensity of 80 % of 1-RM) and 3x3 min high intensity aerobic exercise (16-18 on Borg&#xD;
      scale) on an exercise bike or treadmill twice a week for 16 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 2) includes aerobic exercise on an exercise bike or treadmill, 20 min of moderate&#xD;
      intensity (13-15 on Borg scale), and 3x3 min high intensity aerobic exercise (16-18 on Borg&#xD;
      scale) twice a week during 16 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 3) control group, will get standard information around physical activity during&#xD;
      treatment but no supervised training.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Collection Data will be collected for all study participants regarding demographics and&#xD;
      diagnosis, cancer treatment, laboratory and sick leave data (patient-reported), relapse,&#xD;
      survival, co-morbidity and cause of death in relevant registers.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Data collection of demographic data occurs before (before randomization) and after the&#xD;
           intervention, and at three time points: 1 year, 2 years and 5 years after treatment is&#xD;
           completed. Baseline is about 5 weeks after surgery and before initiation of&#xD;
           chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  All participants that accept participation in the study will undergo a resting ECG&#xD;
           examination and will provide responses to a small, targeted set of heart disease history&#xD;
           questions.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Muscular strength is measured with the instrument JAMAR that is a dynamometer, measuring&#xD;
           muscle strength in the hand. Lower limb muscle strength is measured through isometric&#xD;
           mid-thigh pull. This is assessed in all study participants at all time points: before&#xD;
           and the intervention, year 1, 2, and 5.. The instruments have good reliability and&#xD;
           validity.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Before and after the intervention aerobic fitness (VO2-max) of the participants in the&#xD;
           intervention groups will be assessed with a submaximal exercise test. This will be&#xD;
           measured at all time points: before and the intervention, year 1, 2, and 5.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Algometry, to measure pain sensitivity will be performed at time points: before and&#xD;
           after the intervention, year 2 and 5.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Chemotherapy completion, hospitalization, hemoglobin-, lymphocyte- and platelet&#xD;
           concentrations during chemotherapy will be extracted from the patients' medical records.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood sampling and muscle biopsy procedures will take place at the KPE lab Radiumhemmet,&#xD;
           Karolinska University Hospital, Solna. Muscle biopsies will be obtained under local&#xD;
           anesthesia in the m. vastus lateralis (approximately 100 mg) with a Bergström needle.&#xD;
           This takes place before the intervention starts and 48-72 hours after the last training&#xD;
           session. Mitochondrial density and muscle morphology will be analyzed. Venous blood is&#xD;
           sampled at time points: before and the intervention, year 1, and 5, for analysis of&#xD;
           white cell distribution, for markers of systemic inflammation, and markers of cardiac&#xD;
           damage&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Physical activity level and energy consumption is determined by ActiGraph GT3X&#xD;
           (Actigraph). Actigraph is a combined heart rate sensor and accelerometer that&#xD;
           continuously collects data. The method has been previously tested and is shown to have&#xD;
           good reliability and validity. In this project all the participants in the three groups&#xD;
           will be carrying an Actigraph for seven days, before the intervention. An Activity Diary&#xD;
           for daily subjective reporting of physical activity will also be used during the&#xD;
           intervention period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Instruments&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Piper Fatigue Scale assesses fatigue in four dimensions. The scale has been shown to&#xD;
           have psychometric properties that are reliable for assessing subjective dimensions of&#xD;
           fatigue among Swedish populations of cancer patients. Data will be collected for all&#xD;
           study participants (intervention and control) before randomization and after the&#xD;
           intervention, and at 1 year, 2 years and 5 years after treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Memorial Symptom Assessment Scale (MSAS) assesses 32 common cancer-related symptoms. The&#xD;
           instrument is validated for Swedish patients with breast cancer. Data will be collected&#xD;
           for all study participants before randomization and after the intervention, and at 1&#xD;
           year, 2 years and 5 years after treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  EORTC QLQ-C30 is a cancer-specific instrument that measures health-related quality of&#xD;
           life in terms of physical, emotional, social, cognitive and everyday function. Data will&#xD;
           be collected for all study participants before randomization and after the intervention,&#xD;
           and at 1 year, 2 years and 5 years after treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Sense of coherence (SOC) is a questionnaire, which shows how a person sees the world and&#xD;
           his own life as comprehensible, manageable and meaningful. Individuals with a strong&#xD;
           sense of coherence are able to mobilize the resources to manage their health during&#xD;
           illness and treatment. SOC short version consists of l3 questions that all participants&#xD;
           complete once before the start of treatment. The Swedish version of the SOC-13 has been&#xD;
           shown to have good validity and reliability. It has also demonstrated high internal&#xD;
           consistency.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The Amsterdam Cognition Scan- an online neuropsychological test battery that measures a&#xD;
           broad variety of cognitive functions, measured five years following inclusion to the&#xD;
           exercise intervention&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Echocardiogram- to measure cardiac function, five years following inclusion to the&#xD;
           exercise intervention&#xD;
&#xD;
      Qualitative interviews&#xD;
&#xD;
      • Individual interviews about/around the experience of physical activity associated with&#xD;
      chemotherapy treatment will be carried out with 15 participants. An open question will be&#xD;
      asked, such as &quot;Can you describe how you experienced the period of training?&quot;. Because of the&#xD;
      nature of this question, the women will have the freedom to narrate their stories, and the&#xD;
      interview will focus on elements that surface as significant. Supplementary questions will be&#xD;
      asked to create depth and further understanding of the phenomena.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Analysis Muscle and blood analysis: From 45 participants in the project, we plan to take&#xD;
      a muscle biopsy before and after the training intervention. The molecular exercise physiology&#xD;
      lab is fully equipped to store muscle biopsies and other biological material. Many methods&#xD;
      are set-up in our muscle lab and others are performed in different core facilities. Molecular&#xD;
      and biochemical analyses: Skeletal muscle biopsy samples are obtained with the percutaneous&#xD;
      needle technique. Analysis of protein content, CS activity, and immunohistochemistry will be&#xD;
      performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Quantitative Collected quantitative data will be analysed using parametric statistics for&#xD;
      normally distributed data and non-parametric statistics for non-normally distributed data.&#xD;
      Subgroup analysis will be conducted with a focus on the type of treatment. Power Calculation:&#xD;
      variable cancer related fatigue, selected significance level 0.05, power 0.80 = 240 patients&#xD;
      will be recruited in total to detect a statistical difference with medium effect size.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Qualitative Qualitative data from individual interviews with 15 patients will be analyzed&#xD;
      inductive with content analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Workplan Data collection is currently ongoing and 80 patients are included in the study. With&#xD;
      the current inclusion rate the 240 participants will be included by the end of 2015.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To support the women to uphold PA after treatment is completed a collaboration has been&#xD;
      initiated with Friskis &amp; Svettis in Stockholm, during the five year follow up period this&#xD;
      will encompass FaR (physical activitiy receipt) and invitations to motivational healthy life&#xD;
      style sessions three times a year, the sessions will also include information on longterm&#xD;
      effects/symptoms of treatment and support with self care.&#xD;
