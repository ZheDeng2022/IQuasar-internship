      This proposal is aiming at modifying and improving persistent AF management guidelines by&#xD;
      evaluating targeting DE-MRI detected atrial fibrosis during AF ablation and its related&#xD;
      effect on procedural outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objective: To examine the efficacy of targeting atrial fibrosis tissue during an&#xD;
      ablation procedure in treating persistent AF. Results from the DECAAF study show that one of&#xD;
      the most important predictors of ablation outcome was the degree of ablation of the fibrotic&#xD;
      tissue; the more fibrotic tissue that was overlapped with scar during ablation, the better&#xD;
      the outcome. These results were the impetus for the primary outcome of DECAAF II. Patients&#xD;
      will be randomized to receive conventional pulmonary vein isolation (PVI) ablation or PVI +&#xD;
      fibrosis-guided ablation. The investigators will follow patients longitudinally to assess the&#xD;
      primary outcome identified as recurrence of persistent atrial arrhythmias (AA) (atrial&#xD;
      fibrillation, atrial flutter or atrial tachycardia as defined by recent guidelines [2]). The&#xD;
      investigators hypothesize that patients receiving fibrosis-guided ablation in addition to&#xD;
      conventional PVI ablation will have fewer AA recurrences than those who receive PVI ablation&#xD;
      alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will also examine the efficacy of the fibrosis-guided ablation intervention&#xD;
      on a number of secondary or exploratory outcomes including the individual components of the&#xD;
      primary outcome (atrial fibrillation, atrial flutter and atrial tachycardia), symptomatic&#xD;
      atrial arrhythmia, AF cycle length/regularity/termination, cardiovascular (CV)-related&#xD;
      hospitalization, CV-related mortality, quality of life measurements (University of Toronto&#xD;
      Atrial Fibrillation Severity Scale (AFSS), and AF burden.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The safety of the two interventions will be evaluated by evaluating peri-procedural&#xD;
      complications including stroke, peripheral vascular stenosis, bleeding, esophageal injury,&#xD;
      cardiac perforation, heart failure, and death.&#xD;

      BACKGROUND AND INTRODUCTION:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common cardiac arrhythmia affecting millions of people&#xD;
      in the US and around the world. Treating AF continues to be a challenge. Over the last 15&#xD;
      years, catheter based AF ablation procedure has been widely adopted. Approximately 50% of&#xD;
      patients treated with catheter ablation present with a persistent type of the arrhythmia.&#xD;
      Unfortunately, ablation results in this population have been dismal, not only because of low&#xD;
      success rates in suppressing arrhythmias, but also from a healthcare cost point of view. In&#xD;
      fact, the long-term success of such a procedure has been reported to be as low as 20%, and&#xD;
      patients may need more than two ablation procedures to achieve temporary arrhythmia&#xD;
      suppression. The cost of AF ablation among Medicare patients followed for a year after&#xD;
      ablation was found to be US$16,049 ± 12,536 if ablation was successful versus US$19,997 ±&#xD;
      13,958 for failed ablation. A major issue contributing to the low success of catheter&#xD;
      ablation is the lack of a protocol to appropriately select patients that would respond to&#xD;
      this treatment. Currently, cardiologists base their decision to ablate persistent AF on&#xD;
      various comorbidities, a concept that has not been proven successful. With the introduction&#xD;
      of AF ablation as a first line therapy option in the recent guidelines, a better and more&#xD;
      accurate selection protocol is urgently needed. There is a strong association between AF and&#xD;
      atrial tissue fibrosis. Recently, a novel DE-MRI (Delayed-Enhancement MRI) based imaging&#xD;
      modality has been demonstrated to reveal the degree of fibrotic atrial tissue in patients&#xD;
      suffering from AF. When applied in various studies, including a multicenter study, extent of&#xD;
      fibrotic atrial changes was shown to be the strongest independent predictor of a successful&#xD;
      treatment in patients undergoing ablation of AF. Moreover, in the multicenter observational&#xD;
      study DE-MRI Determinant of Successful Radiofrequency Catheter Ablation of Atrial&#xD;
      Fibrillation (DECAAF), the strongest independent predictor of successful outcome was the&#xD;
      surface area of fibrosis covered by ablation lesions. In fact, the number of encircled&#xD;
      pulmonary veins, the most common adopted approach to ablate AF today, did not predict&#xD;
      catheter ablation success.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The use of non-invasive ambulatory electrocardiography (ECG) devices including 24-48 hour&#xD;
      Holter monitors and 30-day cardiac event monitors have been widely used for the detection of&#xD;
      cardiac rhythm abnormalities. The duration of time for rhythm evaluation is key to detect&#xD;
      arrhythmias and conduction abnormalities, as number of arrhythmia diagnoses increases with&#xD;
      increasing duration of monitoring. The longer duration of monitoring occurs at the expense of&#xD;
      patient comfort and patient compliance. Previous FDA- approved devices for standard of care&#xD;
      monitoring are limited in the duration of monitoring. At many institutions, it is standard of&#xD;
      care to wear a 60-day cardiac event monitor for the detection and evaluation of cardiac&#xD;
      arrhythmias in the post-ablation blanking period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The percentage of asymptomatic recurrences of AF drastically increases after ablation. Thus,&#xD;
      post-procedure devices are necessary for close monitoring and detection of asymptomatic AF in&#xD;
      ablation patients. Compliance with the current cardiac event monitors may be low for many&#xD;
      reasons. Electrode intolerance due to skin rashes, irritation and/or breakdown, and the&#xD;
      unwillingness for continuous devices to be worn are some known areas of non-compliance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A higher level of monitoring can be provided with use of new wireless ECG technologies,&#xD;
      specifically, the FDA approved ECG Check mobile heart monitor designed by Cardiac Designs.&#xD;
      This mobile heart monitor will enable patients to record their heart rhythm anytime and&#xD;
      anywhere. The device will automatically analyze the ECG for symptomatic or asymptomatic&#xD;
      arrhythmias for the duration of their life as long as it is compatible with their current&#xD;
      &quot;smart phone&quot; or tablet computer. This is a patient-owned monitor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The ECG Check is the first FDA-approved over-the-counter ECG monitor that is currently&#xD;
      compatible with approved smart phones. This will allow patients to record, store, transfer&#xD;
      and analyze single-channel ECG wirelessly through the ECG Check app and the ECG Check Web&#xD;
      Center. The information will be uploaded to a protected server through Cardiac Designs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN:&#xD;
&#xD;
      DECAAF II is a prospective, randomized, multicenter trial of patients with persistent AF and&#xD;
      presence of atrial fibrosis. After consenting to participate in the study, the subject will&#xD;
      undergo a DE-MRI scan to assess for extent of atrial fibrosis. Consented patients will be&#xD;
      randomized to one of two study groups to receive conventional PVI ablation (Group 1) or PVI +&#xD;
      fibrosis-guided ablation (Group 2). In Group 1, PVI ablation will be performed as recommended&#xD;
      by the Heart Rhythm Society (HRS) consensus statement and physicians will be blinded to the&#xD;
      pre-ablation MRI fibrosis results. In Group 2, physicians will receive the DE-MRI scan prior&#xD;
      to the ablation procedure and will complete conventional PV isolation and will target left&#xD;
      atrial fibrosis detected by MRI during the ablation procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once randomized, the follow-up period for each patient will extend for 18 months following&#xD;
      the patient's ablation procedure or until a common administrative censoring date 12 months&#xD;
      after the ablation procedure of the final randomized subject, whichever comes first. If a&#xD;
      randomized patient fails to undergo ablation, the patient will be followed for 18 months from&#xD;
      the patient's randomization date or until 12 months after the last patient is randomized,&#xD;
      whichever comes first.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an event-driven trial, in which patient enrollment and follow-up will continue until&#xD;
      approximately 517 randomized subjects experience the primary endpoint of AA recurrence. Under&#xD;
      the assumptions described in the analysis section, it is anticipated that 888 subjects will&#xD;
      be randomized, including 444 assigned to Group 1 and 444 assigned to Group 2. The actual&#xD;
      number enrolled and the duration of the follow-up period will be adjusted as necessary to&#xD;
      achieve the 517 required events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY PROCEDURES&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment Clinical Center staff will approach all potentially eligible patients to&#xD;
      participate in the study. The de-identified characteristics of those refusing to participate&#xD;
      will be collected to ascertain if there is any selection bias that would limit applicability&#xD;
      of the results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Consent If the patient has met the eligibility criteria, the Clinical Center investigator or&#xD;
      delegated study staff will approach the patient to explain the study and obtain informed&#xD;
      consent from the subject to participate. The investigator or designated staff will provide an&#xD;
      explanation of study procedures of the benefits and risks, and the costs and compensation&#xD;
      involved with the study. Participants will be given sufficient time to read the consent form&#xD;
      and the individual obtaining the informed consent will answer any questions posed by the&#xD;
      participant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Imaging Protocol All patients will undergo a DE-MRI within 30 days prior to the ablation&#xD;
      procedure using the Marrek DE-MRI protocol (MRI sequence and Image processing software). The&#xD;
      purpose of the initial MRI is to quantify the degree of atrial structural remodeling or&#xD;
      fibrosis prior to the ablation. If a patient has a heart rate ≥ 90 beats per minute, they&#xD;
      will be pre-medicated with a beta blocker prior to the MRI in order to obtain optimal images.&#xD;
      Images will be sent to Marrek Inc., (Salt Lake City, UT) and will be reviewed for quality by&#xD;
      trained technicians using a standard protocol. Images that do not meet quality standards will&#xD;
      not be further processed. The site physician may opt to repeat the MRI scan and re-submit it&#xD;
      for evaluation. If the image meets quality standards and can be processed, then Marrek will&#xD;
      verify that the subject has some proportion of atrial fibrosis (not limited to advanced stage&#xD;
      fibrosis). Utah Stages 1-4 will be used to classify patients based on percent fibrosis.&#xD;
      Subjects for whom images are successfully evaluated and scored for fibrosis will be&#xD;
      randomized. Following ablation, DE-MRIs will be obtained at the 90 day follow up to detect&#xD;
      and quantify ablation-related scar formation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization After images have been processed and scored for fibrosis, the Data Coordinating&#xD;
      Center (DCC) staff will complete randomization procedures using a web-based randomization&#xD;
      service. Randomization will be stratified by Clinical Center and by Utah Stage (with two Utah&#xD;
      stage strata defined by Utah stages I - II and Utah stages III - IV). For subjects who are&#xD;
      randomized to the fibrosis-guided ablation arm (Group 2), DCC will make the processed images&#xD;
      available to the investigator at the Clinical Center for use during the ablation procedures.&#xD;
      Processed fibrosis images of subjects who are randomized to the PVI ablation group (Group 1)&#xD;
      will not be made available to clinicians or site staff. All images will be retained at the&#xD;
      Marrek site for storage and later analysis. Clinical investigators will schedule the ablation&#xD;
      procedures to occur within approximately 30 days after imaging has been completed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study outcome is formally defined by at least two consecutive, valid ECG tracings&#xD;
      indicating an atrial arrhythmia (AA) (atrial fibrillation, atrial flutter or atrial&#xD;
      tachycardia). Both tracings must be completed after the 90-day blanking period. The two&#xD;
      consecutive tracings demonstrating an atrial arrhythmia must be recorded between 6 hours and&#xD;
      7 days of each other. If an ECG Check tracing demonstrates a non-self-terminating bout of an&#xD;
      atrial arrhythmia (AA), the DCC systems will send a notification to the Clinical Center&#xD;
      indicating that an atrial arrhythmia has been observed. If a second, consecutive ECG Check&#xD;
      reading also demonstrates an atrial arrhythmia 6 hours or up to 7 days after the first&#xD;
      recording, the DCC system will again notify the Clinical Center. In cases where a 12-lead&#xD;
      ECG, obtained for clinical or other reasons, first demonstrates an atrial arrhythmia, a&#xD;
      subsequent, consecutive, valid ECG reading will also be confirmatory of having met the study&#xD;
      outcome. The 12-lead ECG data will be transmitted to the DCC for inclusion in the study&#xD;
      database. This ECG will not be transmitted to the central location for review; rather any&#xD;
      12-lead obtained in association with a study outcome will be read by an independent expert to&#xD;
      verify the presence of AA. This expert will be blinded to study arm. In the possible scenario&#xD;
      where a second ablation is performed after the 90-day blanking period, but there is no&#xD;
      recurrence demonstrated by either ECG measure (12 lead or ECG Check), AA recurrence will be&#xD;
      inferred and assigned to the date of the second ablation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Devices utilized in this trial In this trial, 3 different U.S. Food and Drug Administration&#xD;
      (FDA) approved devices will be utilized. The first is a hand-held ECG application that&#xD;
      transmits the ECG. This device has been approved for the transmittal of ECG information. The&#xD;
      second is a software application for viewing and post-processing of cardiovascular MRIs to&#xD;
      obtain left atrial enhancement quantification and visualization on a 3D model, which has been&#xD;
      previously approved for this indication. Finally, ablation catheters that are used for atrial&#xD;
      fibrillation treatment are being used in their approved manner. Although this trial will be&#xD;
      the first to use all 3 devices together, this use does not necessitate a new IDE as this&#xD;
      composite utilization falls within current approvals for each device for their approved&#xD;
      indications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Endpoints The primary endpoint of the study is the recurrence of atrial arrhythmia&#xD;
      post-ablation, defined as a non-self-terminating bout of atrial fibrillation, atrial flutter,&#xD;
      or atrial tachycardia demonstrated by at least two consecutive, valid ECG tracings occurring&#xD;
      within 6 hours up to a maximum of 7 days of each other after the 90-day post-ablation&#xD;
      blanking period. The primary endpoint will be determined from tracings from the ECG Check&#xD;
      mobile device or a clinically obtained 12-lead ECG indicating persistent atrial arrhythmia.&#xD;
      The clinically obtained 12-lead ECG option will be used if the subject is unwilling or unable&#xD;
      to continue to use the ECG check device. It is difficult to anticipate whether the subject&#xD;
      population will have technical difficulty or accessibility issues using the smart phone and&#xD;
      tablet devices on a daily basis; the 12-lead ECG option is geared to offer an option for&#xD;
      those unable to continue to use the device. If a subject undergoes a second ablation&#xD;
      procedure during the study period (after the 90-day blanking period) but does not have a&#xD;
      documented atrial arrhythmia by the methods described previously, the ablation will also&#xD;
      constitute a study endpoint. Ablations occurring within the 90 day blanking period will not&#xD;
      be counted as an outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Project Enrollment and Follow-up Timeline: This will be a 3-year study with approximately 9&#xD;
      months allotted for developing materials, Institutional Review Board (IRB) approvals, startup&#xD;
      activities, and rolling patient enrollment, approximately 12 months for follow-up after the&#xD;
      last patient is randomized, and 6 months for close-out activities and manuscript preparation.&#xD;
      Our success with DECAAF and the basic inclusion criteria highlight the feasibility of this&#xD;
      project to be completed within 3 years. In addition, many of these Clinical Centers&#xD;
      participated in DECAAF and presented successful recruitment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STATISTICAL ANALYSIS AND POWER&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis Populations Randomized Study Population The randomized study population consists of&#xD;
      all randomized patients, irrespective of whether the patient receives an ablation procedure&#xD;
      or remains in the trial at the close of the blanking period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety Population. The safety population consists of all randomized patients who receive an&#xD;
      ablation procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Modified Intent-to-Treat Population. The modified intent-to-treat population consists of all&#xD;
      randomized patients who remain in follow-up at the close of the 90-day blanking period&#xD;
      irrespective of whether or not the ablation was actually performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Unless indicated otherwise, all statistical analyses of efficacy outcomes will be performed&#xD;
      in the modified intent-to-treat population and all analyses of safety outcomes will be&#xD;
      carried out in the safety population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Descriptive Analyses of Baseline Characteristics Descriptive summaries of baseline clinical&#xD;
      and demographic characteristics will be provided by randomized treatment assignment for a)&#xD;
      the randomized study population, b) the safety population, and c) the modified&#xD;
      intent-to-treat population. Baseline characteristics will also be summarized by randomized&#xD;
      group in the modified intent-to-treat population for each region (North America, Europe,&#xD;
      Asia) and for each clinical center. In the event that substantial imbalances in particular&#xD;
      factors between the randomized treatment groups are detected, sensitivity analyses will be&#xD;
      performed after adding these factors as covariates to the Cox regression analyses described&#xD;
      in the Primary Analysis section below.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Analysis of Atrial Arrhythmia Recurrence The primary efficacy analysis will be&#xD;
      performed in the modified intent-to-treat population using a stratified log-rank test to&#xD;
      compare the time to the first atrial arrhythmia recurrence after the blanking period between&#xD;
      the randomized treatment groups. The log rank test will be stratified by Utah Stage (separate&#xD;
      strata for Utah stages I, II, III, and IV) and region (US/Asia/Canada and Europe). Follow-up&#xD;
      will be censored at loss-to-follow-up or death. The primary analysis will be performed with a&#xD;
      2-sided significance level (alpha) of 0.05.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An associated Cox proportional hazard regression analysis with the same stratification&#xD;
      factors will be performed to estimate the hazard ratio between the fibrosis guided ablation&#xD;
      and conventional ablation groups with its 95% confidence interval. The possibility that the&#xD;
      hazard ratio for treatment assignment varies over the follow-up period (non-proportional&#xD;
      hazards) will be investigated by smoothed Schoenfeld residual plots and by performing&#xD;
      time-dependent Cox regressions including interaction terms between treatment assignment and&#xD;
      follow-up time [S1, S2]. Cumulative incidence curves for the first atrial arrhythmia&#xD;
      recurrence and for death will be constructed by randomized group using a competing risk&#xD;
      framework [S3, S4].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Components of Atrial Arrhythmia Recurrence The frequencies and proportions of patients&#xD;
      experiencing each of three components of the primary atrial arrhythmia outcome - 1) atrial&#xD;
      fibrillation, 2) atrial flutter, and 3) atrial tachycardia - will be tabulated by treatment&#xD;
      group. As in the primary analysis, only events occurring after the end of the blanking period&#xD;
      will be counted in these analyses. Cox regression analyses in which the baseline hazard&#xD;
      function is stratified by Utah stage and region will be used to obtain estimates of&#xD;
      cause-specific hazard ratios and associated 95% confidence intervals to compare the three&#xD;
      components of the primary outcome between the randomized treatment groups. Cumulative&#xD;
      incidence curves will be constructed for each of the three components and death under a&#xD;
      competing risk framework [S3, S4]. The same analyses will also be performed for symptomatic&#xD;
      atrial arrhythmia and for symptomatic atrial arrhythmia requiring treatment. Because the&#xD;
      analyses of the components of the primary endpoint are explanatory, no adjustment for&#xD;
      multiple comparisons will be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subgroup Analyses of Atrial Arrhythmia Recurrence Stratified log-rank tests and&#xD;
      Cox-regressions similar to those described for the primary analysis will be used to compare&#xD;
      the fibrosis guided ablation and conventional interventions in subgroups defined by baseline&#xD;
      fibrosis ≤ or &gt; 20%. The log-rank test and Cox regression in the fibrosis ≤ 20% subgroup will&#xD;
      be stratified by Utah Stages I and II, while the analyses of the fibrosis &gt; 20% subgroup will&#xD;
      be stratified by Utah Stages III and IV. These analyses will be repeated for the three&#xD;
      components of the primary outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Within-Treatment Group Analyses of Atrial Arrhythmia Recurrence Cumulative incidence curves&#xD;
      for the first Atrial Arrhythmia recurrence and for death will be constructed by randomized&#xD;
      group separately for each of the four Utah stages in order to estimate the proportions of&#xD;
      subjects reaching these events by 1 year and by 18 months within each Utah stage. Separate&#xD;
      Cox regression models using cubic splines for percent fibrosis will be used to relate the&#xD;
      hazard for Atrial Arrhythmia recurrence to the pre-ablation percent fibrosis within each&#xD;
      randomized group. Similar Cox regressions with cubic splines will be performed within each&#xD;
      randomized group to relate the hazard for Atrial Arrhythmia recurrence to the percentage of&#xD;
      fibrosis which is covered by the ablation procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main Secondary Efficacy Outcome Quality of life as measured by the Toronto Score will be&#xD;
      treated as the main secondary efficacy outcome. The main secondary analyses will estimate the&#xD;
      effect of the treatment on the mean Toronto scores at months 3, 12, and 18 under a mixed&#xD;
      effects model in which the baseline Toronto score, visit month (treated as a categorical&#xD;
      variable) and the interaction between treatment and visit month are included as fixed&#xD;
      effects. An unstructured covariance model will be used to account for serial correlation in&#xD;
      the Toronto scores across the follow-up visits. The main contrast for testing the effect of&#xD;
      the treatment will compare the adjusted mean Toronto scores at month12 between the guided&#xD;
      ablation and usual care groups. A secondary contrast will compare the adjusted mean Toronto&#xD;
      scores at months 3 and 12 between the guided ablation and usual care groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additional Efficacy Outcomes Stratified log-rank tests and associated Cox-regressions will&#xD;
      also be used to compare initial occurrences of a) a composite outcome including AA recurrence&#xD;
      and prescription of an anti-arrhythmic medication, b) stroke, c) cardiovascular&#xD;
      hospitalization, d) a repeat ablation, and e) AA recurrence following repeat ablation between&#xD;
      the randomized treatment groups. The analysis of repeat ablations will evaluate the time from&#xD;
      the end of the blanking period to the first ablation performed after the close of the&#xD;
      blanking period. The analysis of AA recurrence following repeat ablation will evaluate the&#xD;
      time from the end of the blanking period to the first AA recurrence following the first&#xD;
      repeat ablation. If the patient has an AA recurrence after the blanking period but does not&#xD;
      have a repeat ablation, the outcome for this analysis will be defined as the initial AA&#xD;
      recurrence after the blanking period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mixed effects analyses similar to those described for the Toronto scores will be performed to&#xD;
      compare the physical and mental composite scores from the San Francisco-36 (SF-36) between&#xD;
      the randomized group at months 3, 12 and 18, with primary emphasis given to the month-12&#xD;
      comparison.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proportions of positive responses to the 5 questions asked every other week pertaining to&#xD;
      chest pain, shortness of breath, heart racing, dizziness, and syncope will displayed&#xD;
      graphically along with associated exact binomial 95% confidence intervals by follow-up week&#xD;
      and treatment group. The mean proportions of positive responses over the full follow-up&#xD;
      period will be compared between the targeted ablation group and the usual care group using&#xD;
      generalized estimating equations with a working identity covariance matrix, with covariate&#xD;
      adjustment for the baseline responses [S5]. The Huber sandwich estimator will be used to&#xD;
      compute robust standard errors for statistical inferences.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AA burden will be estimated for each month of follow-up for each subject as a time-weighted&#xD;
      average of the proportion of ECG Check readings during that follow-up month which indicate&#xD;
      the presence of atrial arrhythmia. Generalized estimating equations with stabilized inverse&#xD;
      probability of censoring weights to account for early loss-to-follow-up will be used to&#xD;
      compare these proportions between the randomized treatment groups.&#xD;

      Safety Outcomes The primary safety composite outcome is defined by occurrence of one or more&#xD;
      of the following events during the 1 week period following the ablation procedure: 1) stroke,&#xD;
      2) peripheral vascular stenosis, 3) bleeding, 4) heart failure and 5) death. Additional&#xD;
      safety outcomes include each of the individual components of the primary safety composite as&#xD;
      well as the occurrence of 6) cardiac perforation, or 7) esophageal injury within 1 week of&#xD;
      the ablation procedure. The primary safety composite and the other safety outcomes will be&#xD;
      compared between the randomized treatment groups among patients in the safety population&#xD;
      using Fisher exact tests. The distributions of the duration of the ablation procedure and&#xD;
      fluoroscopy time will also be summarized by randomized group.&#xD;
