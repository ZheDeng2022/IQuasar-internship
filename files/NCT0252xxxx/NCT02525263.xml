      A Phase II, Open-Label Safety and Efficacy Study of an Autologous Neo-Kidney Augment (NKA) in&#xD;
      Patients With Type 2 Diabetes and Chronic Kidney Disease (RMTX-CL001). This is a&#xD;
      Multi-center, prospective, open-label, single-group study. NKA is made from expanded&#xD;
      autologous selected renal cells (SRC) obtained from the patient's kidney biopsy. To&#xD;
      manufacture NKA, kidney biopsy tissue from each enrolled patient will be sent to RegenMedTX,&#xD;
      LLC, where renal cells will be expanded and SRC selected. SRC will be formulated in a gelatin&#xD;
      based hydrogel at a concentration of 100 x 106 cells/mL, packaged in a 10 mL syringe, and&#xD;
      shipped to the clinical site for use. All enrolled subjects will be treated with up to two&#xD;
      injections of NKA at least 6 months apart. Up to 30 subjects undergoing NKA injection will be&#xD;
      enrolled into the study. Patients who have received a single injection of NKA under previous&#xD;
      research protocols may enroll in this clinical trial to receive a single additional&#xD;
      implantation. Patients who have never received an NKA injection may enroll in this clinical&#xD;
      trial for up to a total of two (2) NKA injections, temporally spaced at least 6 months apart.&#xD;
      All biopsies are to be taken from a single kidney, and all NKA injections are to be given&#xD;
      into the kidney that was biopsied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who complete screening procedures satisfying all I/E criteria will be enrolled into&#xD;
      the study immediately prior to the injection. Patients who do not meet all criteria before&#xD;
      injection will be considered screen failures. Once a patient has been injected, the patient&#xD;
      will have completed treatment and every effort should be made to ensure the patient completes&#xD;
      all follow-up visits. Injection dates for the first 3 patients receiving their second NKA&#xD;
      injection will be staggered by a minimum of 3 week intervals to allow for assessment of acute&#xD;
      adverse events and other safety parameters by a Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB). At the&#xD;
      completion of the follow-up visits, patients will continue in a long-term observational&#xD;
      follow-up period. Patients will be followed for a total of 36 months following the last NKA&#xD;
      injection under this protocol, whether the first or second injection.&#xD;
