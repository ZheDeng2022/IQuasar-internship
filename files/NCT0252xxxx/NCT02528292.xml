    <textblock>
      This study will be an open label observational prospective study assessing the clinical&#xD;
      efficacy of antiTNFα therapy and the alteration/impact on the synovial tissue, with specific&#xD;
      regard to lymphoid aggregation, over a period of 12 months in patients with rheumatoid&#xD;
      arthritis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is one of the most important chronic inflammatory disorders in the&#xD;
      UK. It affects approximately 1% of adults and causes considerable morbidity, substantially&#xD;
      reduces quality of life and has a significant mortality. It results in large direct medical&#xD;
      costs as well as extensive indirect social costs. Despite the significant therapeutic&#xD;
      progress following the introduction of antiTNFα, a cure for RA is still elusive. At present&#xD;
      the reasons for the variation in clinical response are not known. The main aim of this study&#xD;
      is to test the hypothesis that there are distinct molecular and cellular phenotypes present&#xD;
      within the synovial tissue that define specific disease subsets and provide characteristic&#xD;
      prognostic implications. In particular, the aim is to assess the relationship between the&#xD;
      presence of ectopic lymphoneogenesis (ELN) within the rheumatoid synovial membrane and&#xD;
      response to antiTNFα therapy.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Men and women ≥ 18 and ≤ 75 years of age, with RA as defined by the 1987 revised ACR&#xD;
             classification criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must fulfill the National Institute for Clinical Excellence guidelines for&#xD;
             TNF Blocking Therapy in RA.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must be on MTX for at least 4 months, with a stable dose of 7.525 mg/week for&#xD;
             a minimum of 4 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Men and women of childbearing potential must use adequate birth control measures (eg,&#xD;
             abstinence, oral contraceptives, intrauterine device, barrier method with spermicide,&#xD;
             or surgical sterilization) for the duration of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must be able to adhere to the study visit schedule.&#xD;
