    <textblock>
      This study was designed to evaluate the correlation between pre-operative FFR and the&#xD;
      functionality of arterial bypass grafts six months after coronary artery bypass grafting.&#xD;
      Patients with multi-vessel coronary artery disease will undergo both a coronary angiogram and&#xD;
      FFR during their diagnostic workup. All patients will be referred for surgical&#xD;
      revascularization (CABG) with planned use of arterial grafts. Six months after surgery,&#xD;
      patients will undergo an angiogram to assess the functionality of the bypass graft and&#xD;
      anastomosis.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The objective of surgical coronary revascularization is to restore blood flow supply to a&#xD;
      myocardial territory that is ischemic or at risk of infarction, by interposing a&#xD;
      low-resistance conduit in parallel to a major diseased coronary artery segment. The&#xD;
      conductance of this additional conduit must be sufficient to accommodate high flow demands&#xD;
      with minimal pressure drop at the site of distal implantation. Such a conduit may be used&#xD;
      either as single independent graft, or assembled in a variety of sequential configurations,&#xD;
      according to the preferred technique and based on the underlying coronary artery disease&#xD;
      (CAD). Saphenous vein grafts (SVGs), most commonly used as single free grafts reimplanted on&#xD;
      the aorta, are large conduits with very limited vasomotion. Their resistance to blood flow is&#xD;
      negligible due to their large diameter, absence of muscular layer and usually short length,&#xD;
      but their long-term patency is hindered by the development of premature atherosclerosis. In&#xD;
      contrast, arterial grafts are usually of smaller diameter and more resistive due to their&#xD;
      histological features. These arterial conduits are usually used in situ, as the second or&#xD;
      third order of branches from the aorta and, therefore, have higher pressure drops compared to&#xD;
      grafts implanted directly onto the aorta. Alternatively, the creation of composite T grafts&#xD;
      with the free right internal thoracic artery (RITA) connected to the in situ left internal&#xD;
      thoracic artery (LITA) can allow revascularization of all myocardium at risk. However,&#xD;
      consequences of such a combination are that the flow supply is entirely dependent on the flow&#xD;
      capacity of the proximal LITA, and that resistance along the graft may become a concern,&#xD;
      particularly at the more distal anastomoses of the configuration (due to the cumulative&#xD;
      length and distal graft tapering).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Competitive flow typically occurs when the resistance of the graft closely matches that of&#xD;
      the native coronary artery target. In this situation, both the native coronary artery and the&#xD;
      bypass graft contribute to distal perfusion, each providing resistance to blood flow from the&#xD;
      other. Schematically, these resistances are arranged in parallel with input pressure at the&#xD;
      coronary ostium or at the ostium of the graft, and output pressure at the anastomotic target&#xD;
      site. The pressures at the two ends of the circuit are identical with only minor phasic&#xD;
      variations in proximal pressure due to the delay in progression of the systolic pressure wave&#xD;
      from the coronary ostium to the more distal ostium of the graft. According to Ohm's law,&#xD;
      blood flow is directly proportional to pressure gradient and inversely proportional to&#xD;
      resistance. Consequently, the relative contribution of the graft and of the native&#xD;
      circulation to distal perfusion will be inversely proportional to their own resistance: if&#xD;
      the resistance of the graft exceeds that of the native vessel (for instance, in situations of&#xD;
      non-severely obstructive CAD), the distal territory will be predominantly perfused by the&#xD;
      native coronary artery; if the resistance of the native vessel remains higher, the flow&#xD;
      through the graft will be predominant; if both conduits oppose near-identical resistances to&#xD;
      flow, their contribution to distal blood flow will be equivalent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Many reports have consistently suggested that competitive flow in arterial bypass grafts&#xD;
      negatively affects patency: more graft failures are observed when native coronary stenosis is&#xD;
      less severe. Further, the misunderstanding of competitive flow also impairs multiple arterial&#xD;
      grafting adoption rates, which remain quite low worldwide despite proven superior outcomes,&#xD;
      due in large part to incomplete understanding of the effects of flow competition by surgeons.&#xD;
      Current methods to evaluate coronary stenosis are: visual inspection, quantitative&#xD;
      computerized angiography (QCA) and fractional flow reserve (FFR). Several studies have&#xD;
      compared these three methods, demonstrating that visual assessment and QCA are of limited&#xD;
      value for accurately predicting the significance of most intermediate narrowings and,&#xD;
      therefore, at predicting a competition phenomenon. In contrast, FFR measures the consequence&#xD;
      of the stenosis in terms of reduction of blood flow capacity. FFR reliably identifies&#xD;
      stenoses associated with inducible ischemia with more than 93% accuracy, a rate higher than&#xD;
      any other test. Despite these advantages, FFR is not widely applied especially in coronary&#xD;
      surgery whereas in interventional cardiology, it is used near systematically. What the&#xD;
      investigators propose in this collaborative study is a complete paradigm shift in how&#xD;
      coronary surgery is carried out - total arterial grafting supported by a true physiologic&#xD;
      basis, and a correlated proof of its outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently, indications for surgical coronary revascularization still largely rely only on&#xD;
      visual estimation of stenoses. Unfortunately, the estimation of the true coronary lesion&#xD;
      severity by visual estimation is especially poor for moderate lesions, i.e. between 50 to 70%&#xD;
      stenosis. An FFR cutoff value of 0.8 is obtained in only 35% of these moderate lesions. When&#xD;
      using saphenous vein, the impact of competition flow on graft patency is minimal in this&#xD;
      situation but when an artery conduit is preferred, it impacts the functionality of the graft&#xD;
      significantly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, the investigators are proposing a prospective FFR evaluation of surgical patients&#xD;
      with 3-vessel CAD, whose disease severity will be estimated by visual inspection during&#xD;
      diagnostic angiogram. FFR will be performed and all values will be recorded; however, the&#xD;
      patient, interventional cardiologist, and surgeon will be blinded to its results. All&#xD;
      patients will then undergo coronary surgery with planned arterial revascularization. Six&#xD;
      months after surgery, a control angiogram will be performed to evaluate functionality of the&#xD;
      grafts. The results of this functional assessment will be correlated with the preoperative&#xD;
      FFR values, in order to find a cutoff above which the arterial grafts are not functional,&#xD;
      which will also be analyzed by subgroups defined according to configuration (i.e. in situ or&#xD;
      composite).&#xD;
