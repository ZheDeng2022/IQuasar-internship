  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To assess the safety and tolerability of orally-administered CR845 in patients with&#xD;
      osteoarthritis (OA) of the hip or knee. The study drug is being tested to reduce OA pain, and&#xD;
      will be taken twice a day for two weeks, with four different doses (strengths) being tested.&#xD;
      From screening period to follow up examination, the study is expected to last for up to 38&#xD;
      days per participant.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this clinical study is to collect information on the effectiveness of CR845&#xD;
      and to look at the safety of different dose levels of CR845 tablets. Oral CR845 has been&#xD;
      tested in healthy people. This is the first time that oral CR845 is being tested in patients&#xD;
      with osteoarthritis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Four different doses of CR845 will be tested in this study. Participants will be assigned to&#xD;
      one of the four treatment groups. The first 6 participants in each of the 4 treatment groups&#xD;
      will be given the study drug in an inpatient study unit (clinic) for approximately 2 days.&#xD;
      Frequent blood samples will be taken to measure drug levels during these 2 days. Also,&#xD;
      because the study drug (CR845) is known to increase urination during the first day, the&#xD;
      amount of fluid that participants drink and the amount of urine that they void during the&#xD;
      first day will also be measured.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of the second day, a member of the clinical staff will check vital signs and the&#xD;
      patient's laboratory results prior to discharge from the clinic. After that, the remainder of&#xD;
      the treatment period is as an outpatient (at home). This involves taking an additional two&#xD;
      tablets twice a day, and maintaining a diary that will be returned to the clinic upon&#xD;
      completion.&#xD;
