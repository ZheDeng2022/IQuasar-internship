      Introduction:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goal of a usability evaluation is to assess the degree to which a system is effective,&#xD;
      efficient and favours positive attitudes and responses from the intended users. Exergames in&#xD;
      particular present unique usability challenges. Because games are fundamentally different&#xD;
      than general productivity tools, traditional usability instruments valid for productivity&#xD;
      applications may fall short when used for serious games.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additionally, serious games target audiences may not play games regularly; usability issues&#xD;
      alone can hinder the game play process negatively affecting the learning experience. For this&#xD;
      reason, user-based evaluation for exergames with adequate test user group is very important&#xD;
      to ensure that heterogeneous population will be able to interact easily with innovative&#xD;
      applications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exergames:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exergames are defined as: ''Any number of types of video games that require the game player&#xD;
      to physically move in order to play''.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The important aspect, in comparison to a normal videogame, is that the player uses full body&#xD;
      movements to control on-screen action and is required to expend a significantly greater&#xD;
      amount of energy compared with resting levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One of the areas that have received attention of video game researchers is that of&#xD;
      therapeutic sessions. When exergames were used with elderly people for therapeutic sessions,&#xD;
      it showed that special needs have to be considered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The GameUp project:&#xD;
&#xD;
      For this reason the project GameUp was started. On their Website the project consortium&#xD;
      state: &quot;We will use IT technologies to promote mobility by encouraging elderly persons to be&#xD;
      more physical active and motivating them to move more by increasing their self-efficacy&quot;. In&#xD;
      this context exergames for elderly people were designed for Kinect® for windows. Kinect®&#xD;
      observes all the body movements from the game player, so that they can operate the game with&#xD;
      their body movements. In this context the game player is forced to move his body frequently&#xD;
      in a way that increases his agility.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therapist's view:&#xD;
&#xD;
      How do physiotherapists view the arrival of exergames in therapy rehabilitation setting,&#xD;
      especially exergames for elderly people? Studies that focus on the therapist's view are&#xD;
      really rare. One reference came to the conclusion that: &quot;Video games should not be seen as a&#xD;
      replacement of a therapist. The presence of the therapist will always be necessary for these&#xD;
      patients to ensure that they play the game in the correct seating position, to provide mental&#xD;
      support and social interaction during game play.&quot; But how do therapists view the use from&#xD;
      exergames which patients could do by themselves as self-training during rehabilitation or at&#xD;
      home? The same reference argues: &quot;The therapist is paramount in introducing games or virtual&#xD;
      rehabilitation to end-users; if he will not adopt the tool in his practice, neither will the&#xD;
      patients.&quot;&#xD;
&#xD;
      Purpose of the Study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to evaluate, if elderly people accept exergames as self-training&#xD;
      method and if this exergame is user-friendly for elderly people and physiotherapists. An&#xD;
      additionally goal is to examine how physiotherapists evaluate the therapeutic benefit from&#xD;
      this exergame.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Question:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Are exergames useable and accepted for self-training for elderly people, by themselves as&#xD;
      well as by physiotherapists?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design of the user trial:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is a usability design with qualitative and quantitative aspects. In one part, with&#xD;
      patients, physical strain and designs facets will be investigated and in another part with&#xD;
      physiotherapists, the therapeutic relevance and design features will be explored. Ideally the&#xD;
      attributes required to make the product usable should be specified and measured&#xD;
      quantitatively against predefined goals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Number of users needed:&#xD;
&#xD;
      How many users are needed for a usability study is a controversial subject in the literature.&#xD;
      One main point is that: &quot;The test users should ideally reflect the serious game's target&#xD;
      audience in terms of age, gender, education and any other demographic characteristics&quot;. In an&#xD;
      other study is mentioned two other important aspects: It seems that serious usability&#xD;
      problems were only found with the 13th and 15th participant. Furthermore for a usability&#xD;
      test, it is the aim to find a study design that uncovers usability problems at the lowest&#xD;
      cost.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In consideration of these arguments this study protocol will include 13-15 participants with&#xD;
      different mobility levels. As the mobility level is the most important demographic character,&#xD;
      it should be reflected by the user group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the physiotherapist the most important demographic character is their experience with&#xD;
      exergames, so for this reason 13-15 physiotherapists with different experiences with&#xD;
      exergames will be tested.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measurements:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Heart Rate (HR):&#xD;
&#xD;
      Heart rate is an indicator of cardiovascular strain and provides an objective measure of&#xD;
      physical work load. HR of the elderly user will be measured before playing the game, directly&#xD;
      after finishing the game and after two minutes break.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The predefined usability criterion is: The mean HR of 80% of elderly users will be below 110&#xD;
      beats per minute. Previous studies have specified that heart rate between 90 and 110&#xD;
      indicates moderate cardiovascular strain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rate of Perceived Exertion (RPE):&#xD;
&#xD;
      Borg's RPE-Scale is a standardized, reliable and valid tool to describe the perception of&#xD;
      exertion. Elderly users will be presented the Borg's 15-graded RPE scale immediately after&#xD;
      completion of the task and will be asked to rate their perceived exertion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The predefined usability criterion is: The RPE-score of 80% of elderly users will be below&#xD;
      14. This is based on previous studies where scores of more than 13 RPE have been associated&#xD;
      with an increased relative risk for musculoskeletal symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Body Part Discomfort Scale (BPD Scale):&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Body Part Discomfort Scale has become a standard discomfort assessment tool in ergonomics&#xD;
      research. Elderly users will be presented with a body map at the beginning and immediately&#xD;
      after completion of the user trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The predefined usability criterion is: BPD Scale reports of 80% of the elderly users will be&#xD;
      below 4. This is based on previous studies where moderate discomfort levels for any body part&#xD;
      were selected as a threshold where redesign should be considered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Task Analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Perceive, Recall Plan and Perform System (PRPP) is a process-oriented assessment that&#xD;
      employs task analysis methods to determine problems with task performance. For this usability&#xD;
      study a task analysis will be done during an elderly user or a physiotherapist is playing the&#xD;
      game. The major task steps will be analysed to identify where the users struggles with the&#xD;
      game design.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The predefined usability criterion for elderly user is: 80% of the elderly users can perform&#xD;
      60% of the needed steps without assistance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The predefined usability criterion for the physiotherapists is: 80% of the physiotherapist&#xD;
      can perform 80% of the needed steps without assistance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      User Questionnaire:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Furthermore to the objective measurements the users will be asked questions about their&#xD;
      feelings and opinions about the game. Especially the physiotherapists will be asked if they&#xD;
      see a positive therapeutic aspect and if they could imagine giving patients exergames as&#xD;
      self-training exercises. This will be done with a questionnaire that includes open questions&#xD;
      and five-point Likert scale questions. This is based on publications where it is considered&#xD;
      important that the user has a positive attitude towards the product, to ensure regular and&#xD;
      widespread use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data analyses:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Quantitative data will be collected to review the predefined usability criteria as specified&#xD;
      above, using simple descriptive statistics. As sampling will be selective rather than random&#xD;
      and the sample size will be small, statistical calculations will most likely be restricted to&#xD;
      using median values and ranges. The median is used when no normal distribution of the data is&#xD;
      expected and is considered a more robust value since it is not influenced by extremes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Qualitative data will be presented as a written summary of the open questions from the&#xD;
      questionnaires.&#xD;
