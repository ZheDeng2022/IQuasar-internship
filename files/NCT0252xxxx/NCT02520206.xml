  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators propose to conduct a translational study on the regulation of&#xD;
      S-adenosylmethionine synthesis and cellular methylation reactions during chronic&#xD;
      inflammation. Development of in vitro cell models may reveal the regulatory mechanisms by&#xD;
      which specific inflammatory mediators cause metabolic changes and alter DNA methylation&#xD;
      status. Metabolic and pharmacological studies in the in vivo models will enable us to better&#xD;
      understand the regulation of inter-organ homeostasis of S-adenosyl methionine and help&#xD;
      identify tissue specific biomarkers for methylation and epigenetic modifications in different&#xD;
      stage of chronic inflammation. The clinical study in human subjects will help distinguish the&#xD;
      impacts of autoimmune rheumatic disease, degenerated joint disease, or specific medication&#xD;
      use on significant clinical and biochemical markers in folate and vitamin B6 metabolic&#xD;
      pathways.The Investigators hope the present study can identify specific clinical markers for&#xD;
      potential epigenetic changes in patients suffering from chronic inflammation, which will&#xD;
      contribute to better clinical management of these diseases in humans.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The significance of epigenetic alterations in autoimmune rheumatic diseases and degenerated&#xD;
      joint diseases has drawn great attention among clinicians and researchers. Aberrant&#xD;
      methylation status has been demonstrated in human chronic inflammation yet more efforts have&#xD;
      focused on global and sequence-specific hypomethylation and overexpression of specific genes.&#xD;
      Few studies investigated the regulation of S-adenosylmethionine homeostasis and regulation&#xD;
      during inflammation. At present the relevance and regulation of the complex epigenetic&#xD;
      profiles and their modifications among different tissues and organs during inflammation&#xD;
      remain largely unknown.&#xD;
