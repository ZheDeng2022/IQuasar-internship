      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cancer-induced bone pain (CIBP) is common in people with cancer. Bone cancer can also lead to&#xD;
      anxiety, depression, and reduced mobility and quality of life. Researchers believe a research&#xD;
      drug called resiniferatoxin (RTX) may be able to help.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To learn whether RTX is safe and can reduce cancer induced bone pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      People ages 18 and older with CIBP that is not relieved by standard treatments&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have up to 6 outpatient visits over about 7 months. These will include:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Medical history&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physical exam&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood and urine tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thermal testing: a disk placed on the skin to test ability to sense temperature in and around&#xD;
      the area of pain&#xD;
&#xD;
      Chest x-ray&#xD;
&#xD;
      EKG: stickers are placed on the chest to measure heart signals&#xD;
&#xD;
      ECG: measures electrical activity of the heart&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have 1 inpatient visit lasting 2-4 days. This will include:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Catheter inserted into a vein in the arm. They are given anesthesia, sedation, and x-ray&#xD;
      contrast.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A needle is passed through the skin of the back to inject the RTX.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will keep a log of the pain medications they take after surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be called 1 week and 2, 3, and 4 months after the injection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be mailed surveys and questionnaires to complete 2, 3, and 4 months after&#xD;
      the injection.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cancer-induced bone pain (CIBP) is a common clinical problem. While primary osteosarcoma is&#xD;
      relatively uncommon, bone metastases frequently cause cancer-related pain with metastatic&#xD;
      spread to bone in 60-84% of cases. Resiniferatoxin (RTX) is an ultrapotent agonist analog of&#xD;
      capsaicin that targets a receptor expressed on specific dorsal root sensory ganglia (DRG)&#xD;
      neurons and is expected to reduce pain within the targeted zone. The overall program goal is&#xD;
      to develop a new treatment for intractable chronic pain below the mid-thoracic level&#xD;
      resulting from CIBP that has not been controlled with conservative treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective it to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of RTX when injected&#xD;
      near one or more DRGs, to characterize its safety/toxicity profile, and to identify any&#xD;
      dose-limiting toxicity (DLT). The secondary objectives are to determine the relative change&#xD;
      in pain reduction, the change in opioid analgesic consumption and quality of life prior to&#xD;
      RTX injection and at the various post RTX timepoints.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 30 adult subjects are estimated to be necessary for enrollment to have up to 16&#xD;
      subjects who will receive RTX and provide study-related assessment results through the 30-day&#xD;
      time point.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is a single center, open-label Phase 1b dose escalation safety and efficacy trial&#xD;
      for adult subjects with intractable pain due to CIBP below the mid-thoracic level. Those&#xD;
      subjects who meet all inclusion and exclusion criteria will undergo various study procedures&#xD;
      and then be scheduled for the unilateral periganglionic (PG) DRG injection(s) (a maximum of 3&#xD;
      contiguous levels) under fluoroscopic guidance to treat the targeted DRGs demonstrated to be&#xD;
      responsible for the chronic CIBP. The RTX will be injected at 1 of 4 dose levels, 0.8mcg/DRG,&#xD;
      1.6 mcg/DRG, 3.2 mcg/DRG or 6.4 mcg/DRG. The adaptivedesign algorithm for this study utilizes&#xD;
      outcome dependent randomization, a process that selects the dose to be administered to the&#xD;
      next subject based on all previous outcomes. In this schema, DLT is the measure that will be&#xD;
      used to determine if it is safe to escalate to the next highest dose level.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects who are screen failures and those who prematurely terminate participation will be&#xD;
      replaced until 16 subjects have received the injection(s) and completed study-related&#xD;
      assessments through the day 30 (D30) timepoint. There is no placebo group because of the&#xD;
      invasive nature of the injection and the dose escalation performed in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome Measures&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome is to achieve a dose-response relationship for safety. All subjects will&#xD;
      receive RTX. The secondary outcome measures are: 1) change in NRS and VAS scores at the&#xD;
      post-RTX assessments compared to pre RTX assessment, 2) change of opioid usage (in MME) at&#xD;
      post RTX assessments compared to pre RTX assessment; 3) comparison SF-36 and BDI at pre RTX&#xD;
      injection and Days 14, 37, and 187.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The efficacy outcome variable will be evaluated by establishing dose-response curves, with&#xD;
      dose plotted on the x-axis and changes in efficacy endpoints (before RTX treatment and at the&#xD;
      post RTX assessment visits) plotted on the y-axis. If, at the end of the study, all dose&#xD;
      levels of RTX have equal pain-relieving efficacy, the Data Safety Monitoring Committee (DSMC)&#xD;
      may determine if it is appropriate to include a dose lower than 0.8 mcg and/or a control&#xD;
      group. On the other hand, if the dose-response curves show that higher doses could result in&#xD;
      greater pain-relieving efficacy, the protocol may be amended to include higher doses of RTX.&#xD;

&#xD;
          2. Must be diagnosed with histologically-confirmed cancer-induced bone pain producing&#xD;
             intractable chronic pain in the target area (mid thoracic or chest level down to lower&#xD;
             extremities) which was poorly responsive to conservative therapies based on patient&#xD;
             report, such as analgesic medication management with potent opioids with or without&#xD;
             prior radiotherapy, bisphosphonates, or radioisotope therapy. Additionally, pain that&#xD;
             is non-responsive to non-opioid drugs in situations where opioids were not tolerated.&#xD;
             Conservative therapies do not include invasive treatments, such as neurolytic&#xD;
             procedure, including surgical neurolysis, percutaneous regional or neuraxial&#xD;
             continuous infusions (whether opioid or local anesthetic), and peripheral&#xD;
             neuromodulation or spinal cord stimulation, but may include temporary diagnostic or&#xD;
             therapeutic procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Not currently seeking or receiving potentially curative therapies for cancer (e.g.,&#xD;
             chemotherapy or immunotherapy). Curative cancer therapy may be sought after the&#xD;
             Outpatient Follow Up visit 14 (D14). Palliative anti-tumor therapy is allowed as long&#xD;
             as the subject was established on that therapy prior to enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Must have moderate to severe pain that is not relieved by standard treatments. Mean&#xD;
             daily worst pain NRS score of greater than or equal to 6 for pain at or below the T6&#xD;
             dermatome (level of the chest) that is associated with a malignant disease. The mean&#xD;
             score must be derived from recordings on at least 4 of 7 consecutive days within 3&#xD;
             weeks preceding treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. The subject must agree to undergo a diagnostic periganglionic injection(s) with a&#xD;
             long-acting local anesthetic (e.g., bupivacaine) under fluoroscopic guidance which&#xD;
             resulted in at least a 30% temporary pain reduction in the targeted pain region&#xD;
             lasting for the expected duration of the local anesthetic used.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Must be healthy enough to tolerate study procedures in the judgment of the&#xD;
             investigator.&#xD;

             not limited to Coumadin, heparin, or Xarelto) will be counseled either to stop taking&#xD;
             these at least 7 days before surgery or be given instructions on dosing changes if&#xD;
             applicable. In addition, if patients are currently taking a Factor Xa inhibitor (such&#xD;
             as Xarelto) a hematology consult will be obtained. Subjects must be willing to comply&#xD;
             with this requirement, which is standard clinical practice when undergoing elective&#xD;
             surgical procedures to avoid surgical and post-surgical bleeding complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Formal review of the subject s medical records and written approval for his/her&#xD;
             inclusion in the study by 3 separate persons:&#xD;

&#xD;
             evidenced by the following blood laboratory values within the week prior to the&#xD;
             planned injection:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  PT/INR (prothrombin time/International normalized ratio) &gt; 1.5 times upper limit&#xD;

             hemorrhage than periganglionic infection. Patients with TNC&lt;1500 (neutropenia) may be&#xD;
             eligible later if their TNC level becomes greater than 1500 spontaneously or after use&#xD;
             of medications stimulating granulocyte production, such as Neupogen (granulocyte&#xD;

             adversely impact the subject s participation or safety, conduct of the study, or&#xD;
             interfere with the pain assessment, such as poorly controlled diabetes or&#xD;
             hypertension. Patients can be re-assessed for eligibility if these conditions can be&#xD;
             controlled medically.&#xD;
