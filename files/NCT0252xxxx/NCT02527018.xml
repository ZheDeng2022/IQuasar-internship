      Primary Endpoint: Quantify the hemodynamic changes in preeclampsia using the non-invasive&#xD;
      Nexfin device.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Endpoint: Determine if measurable hemodynamic changes are statistically correlated&#xD;
      with B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) levels.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Hypertensive disorders of pregnancy including preeclampsia are the leading cause of pregnancy&#xD;
      related mortality in the United States. Timely and appropriate management of hypertensive&#xD;
      disorders of pregnancy is critical to prevent complications such as kidney failure, HELLP&#xD;
      syndrome, disseminated intravascular coagulation, placental abruption, intrauterine fetal&#xD;
      demise, intracranial bleed, coma and death. (HELLP syndrome is a group of symptoms that occur&#xD;
      inpregnant women who have: H -- hemolysis (the breakdown of red blood cells); EL -- elevated&#xD;
      liver enzymes; LP -- low platelet count.) Hypertensive disorders of pregnancy include&#xD;
      gestational hypertension (HTN), chronic HTN, preeclampsia and preexisting HTN with&#xD;
      superimposed preeclampsia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypertensive disorders may also lead to significant maternal and/or fetal morbidity. Based on&#xD;
      the severity of the disease process and gestational age of the fetus, decision needs to be&#xD;
      made whether to proceed with immediate delivery or continue expectant management. Meanwhile,&#xD;
      maintenance of optimal blood pressure, blood volume, and cardiac output are recommended to&#xD;
      preserve placental perfusion and to prevent unfavorable maternal and/or fetal outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Previous studies have demonstrated blood flow differences in pregnancies complicated by&#xD;
      preeclampsia vs. healthy pregnant women evidenced by decreased arterial compliance, increased&#xD;
      systemic vascular resistance and after load, and changes in blood volume and cardiac output.&#xD;
      Additionally, various serum markers have been tried to identify women with preeclampsia.&#xD;
      B-Type natriuretic peptide (BNP) has been consistently shown to be elevated in preeclampsia,&#xD;
      and serves as a marker of heart function and intra vascular volume status.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Continuous hemodynamic monitoring may play a crucial role in timely management of these&#xD;
      patients with severe disease due to the dynamic nature of the disease process. Existing&#xD;
      methods are not preferred in pregnancy due to their invasive nature, and there is lack of&#xD;
      validated non-invasive means to provide real time information on various hemodynamic&#xD;
      parameters including cardiac output in these critically ill pregnant women.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Among new cardiac monitoring devices, the Nexfin device (BMEYE, Amsterdam, Netherlands) has&#xD;
      recently been introduced. Nexfin device is a device approved by the Food and Drug&#xD;
      Administration (FDA) as a non-invasive reliable method of continuous measuring arterial blood&#xD;
      pressure in pregnant women. However there are no preliminary data on preeclamptic patients&#xD;
      using this device. The standard of care is to use a sphygmomanometer for blood pressure&#xD;
      monitoring. Additionally there are no studies comparing the hemodynamics of healthy and&#xD;
      preeclamptic women using Nexfin device. Nexfin is thought to be superior over other available&#xD;
      non-invasive methods as it is a safe and a considerably accurate method. Nexfin provides&#xD;
      continuous blood pressure, heart rate, cardiac output, stroke volume, systemic vascular&#xD;
      resistance and left ventricular contractility indices.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study aims to determine if the non-invasive Nexfin device can be used to reliably&#xD;
      distinguish hemodynamics in preeclamptic vs. healthy pregnant women with singleton&#xD;
      pregnancies along with use of BNP levels. Investigators aim to recruit 33 healthy controls&#xD;
      and 33 subjects diagnosed with preeclampsia (mild and severe). Subject's systolic and&#xD;
      diastolic blood pressures will be measured using both the Nexfin device and a standard&#xD;
      sphygmomanometer (blood pressure meter). Additionally hemodynamic measure such as: heart&#xD;
      rate, cardiac output, stroke volume, systemic vascular resistance, and left ventricular&#xD;
      contractility will be recorded using the Nexfin device. Investigators will perform a blood&#xD;
      draw to measure BNP levels as an additional assessment of the hemodynamic changes in the two&#xD;
      groups.&#xD;
