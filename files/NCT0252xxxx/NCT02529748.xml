  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Dermal transfer efficiency has been defined as the amount of material that moves from one&#xD;
      surface to another following contact. The investigators propose to measure dermal transfer&#xD;
      efficiency for the following pathways: (1) object to skin, (2) skin to skin, (3) skin to&#xD;
      mouth, (4) clothing to skin, (5) gloves to skin, and (6) air to skin. First, the quantitative&#xD;
      dermal transfer will be measured for the two selected test substances (lead, Tinopal) for&#xD;
      each of these six pathways. The relative quantities of dermal transfer will also then be&#xD;
      compared between the different transfer pathways (e.g., is skin to skin transfer greater or&#xD;
      less than clothing to skin transfer?). And second, the pattern of transfer will be&#xD;
      characterized semi-quantitatively (e.g., does dermal transfer occur consistently and evenly&#xD;
      to the skin from different reservoirs?).&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Each of the six transfer pathways will be tested and measured in a controlled, ventilated&#xD;
      study chamber at the University of Minnesota's School of Public Health Industrial Hygiene&#xD;
      Laboratory. To test each pathway, human volunteers will perform repeated contact activities&#xD;
      using an identical protocol (e.g., identical number of contacts, type of material contacted,&#xD;
      measured pressure of contact, measured time of contact, measured temperature and humidity) so&#xD;
      that inter- and intra-individual variability can be characterized.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The qualitative and quantitative sampling methods that will be used have been developed,&#xD;
      tested, and published by researchers from the National Institute for Occupational Safety and&#xD;
      Health (NIOSH) and other institutions such as ASTM. Specifically, quantitative transfer&#xD;
      efficiencies will be measured using accepted wipe sampling protocols taken from several&#xD;
      papers in the peer-reviewed literature. Semi-quantitative transfer patterns will be measured&#xD;
      using fluorescent tracer intensity techniques that have also been presented in the&#xD;
      peer-reviewed literature. The skin surface wipe samples will be sent to an accredited&#xD;
      American Industrial Hygiene Association (AIHA) laboratory for analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These sampling results will allow the investigators to report the measured quantitative&#xD;
      dermal transfer efficiencies of elemental metallic lead and Tinopal for each pathway in mass&#xD;
      per square surface area of skin, and also calculate the relative transfer efficiencies in&#xD;
      terms of percent transferred versus originally loaded. Fluorescent tracer maps will allow the&#xD;
      investigators to demonstrate the patterns of transfer for each pathway using intensity of the&#xD;
      tracer following transfer. Following this analysis, the investigators will then use the data&#xD;
      to better inform the relative importance of the pathways in the conceptual model with respect&#xD;
      to dermal exposure assessment and modeling efforts. These results are very important for&#xD;
      improving the quality of workplace dermal exposure assessments and techniques. The current&#xD;
      approaches are not well validated, and it is unknown if the results of existing dermal&#xD;
      exposure models are accurate. It is expected that the results of this study will help to&#xD;
      improve the protection of workers from certain dermal exposure hazards in the workplace by&#xD;
      providing better inputs to the existing dermal exposure models, since it is not possible to&#xD;
      collect exposure samples for each job task in the workplace.&#xD;
