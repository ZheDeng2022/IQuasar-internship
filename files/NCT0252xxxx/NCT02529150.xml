  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      One in four deaths in the United States is due to cancer, and one in three women will develop&#xD;
      cancer in her lifetime. Despite improvements in survival among other forms of cancer, ovarian&#xD;
      cancer prognosis remains poor. Eighty percent of women with ovarian cancer will present with&#xD;
      advanced disease (stage 3 or 4) where 5-year survival ranges from 18-34%.2 Among patients&#xD;
      with stage III and IV epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC), recurrence rates are high.4 Therefore,&#xD;
      interventions focused on preventing recurrence or slowing progression of EOC is a critical&#xD;
      problem in the field. The investigators have submitted an R21 to NCI for a dose response&#xD;
      exercise intervention trial to examine the dose response effects of aerobic exercise on&#xD;
      biomarkers relevant to ovarian cancer progression and recurrence. The reviewers would like&#xD;
      assurance that the investigators can recruit ovarian cancer patients into an exercise study&#xD;
      and that these women will do the exercise protocol we plan to prescribe in our high dose of&#xD;
      exercise.&#xD;
