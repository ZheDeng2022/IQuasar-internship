  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, controlled, single-center study in otherwise healthy infertile female&#xD;
      subjects undergoing in vitro fertilization (IVF). The subjects recruited for this study will&#xD;
      be among those patients who have been diagnosed with infertility and are planning to undergo&#xD;
      IVF at the centers where this study is being performed. The patients will have undergone the&#xD;
      usual informed consent procedure at the center.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Subjects will undergo ovarian stimulation, oocyte retrieval, IVF, and Intra Cytoplasmic Sperm&#xD;
      Injection (ICSI) procedure following the center's usual procedures. The cohort of injected&#xD;
      oocytes from each patient will be randomly divided between the one step and sequential&#xD;
      medias: CRM (Cornell- Center for Reproductive Medicine) media (C1/C2 or C3) vs G-TL Time&#xD;
      Lapse media or G-1/G-2 media. Single step or sequential media are both buffered mediums for&#xD;
      culture from oocyte fertilization to blastocyst stage. Sequential media is formulated&#xD;
      according to the stages of embryo development and embryos are re-cultured in medias according&#xD;
      to their stage of development. Single step (time lapse) media is formulated for continuous&#xD;
      culture from D0 to Day 5/6.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mature oocytes will be randomized via a non-bias computer program into two to four of the&#xD;
      study groups: G-TL commercial single step (Vitrolife), Vitrolife's sequential media,&#xD;
      Cornell's single step , and Cornell's sequential media. Oocytes will be divided randomly&#xD;
      among the various media dependent upon the number of mature oocytes. I.e.: 10 oocytes&#xD;
      injected = 2 media groups; 15 oocytes injected = up to 3 media groups; 20 oocytes injected =&#xD;
      up to 4 media groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      &quot;Best grade&quot; embryos will be transferred regardless of media source. If embryos are&#xD;
      transferred from multi-source media and if researchers are unable to determine the media&#xD;
      source after transfer, the subject will not be included in the outcome data portion of the&#xD;
      study- e.g pregnancy outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Time-Lapse monitoring system will be used as standard clinical practice to observe&#xD;
      development and document timing of embryo cleavages and morphology dynamics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Endpoints will be Day 3 and Day 5/6 embryo development, implantation and pregnancy rate. The&#xD;
      study is approximately 2 months, the estimated time it takes a physician to perform one&#xD;
      IVF-ART IVF- Assisted Reproductive Technology) treatment cycle. If embryos are frozen, the&#xD;
      patient may be in the study until the time they choose to thaw the embryos or up to 1 year if&#xD;
      they become pregnant.&#xD;
