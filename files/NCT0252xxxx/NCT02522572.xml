  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to conduct a proof of concept pilot study that will&#xD;
      provide a preliminary evaluation of the safety of plerixafor alone or in combination with&#xD;
      bortezomib on plasma cell mobilization, Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) antibody levels and&#xD;
      toxicity profile in sensitized patients awaiting kidney transplantation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objective of this study is to conduct additional analyses of the study regimen&#xD;
      on HLA antibody levels using multiple different assays and statistical analysis.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators have previously demonstrated that proteasome inhibition (with bortezomib)&#xD;
      provides effective antihumoral therapy for antibody-mediated rejection (AMR) and for&#xD;
      desensitization in kidney transplant recipients and candidates. These studies have also&#xD;
      demonstrated that plasma cell populations exhibit significant heterogeneity. Newly produced&#xD;
      plasma blasts and plasma cells, whether from a primary or anamnestic immunologic response,&#xD;
      during an acute AMR, are very sensitive to proteasome inhibitor-based therapy. Of the plasma&#xD;
      cell populations we have examined, those that demonstrate the greatest degree of resistance&#xD;
      to proteasome inhibitor therapy are those that reside within bone marrow niches. These long&#xD;
      lived bone marrow niche resident plasma cell (LLBMNRPC) populations demonstrate a significant&#xD;
      degree of resistance to bortezomib therapy. This concept of plasma cell niche providing long&#xD;
      term survival signals is supported by substantial literature from murine models. A number of&#xD;
      signals are involved that derive from the plasma cell niche which are thought to contribute&#xD;
      to long lived plasma cell survival including CXC-chemokine receptor 4 (CXCR4)/chemokine&#xD;
      (C-X-C motif) ligand 12 (CXCL12) interactions, Interleukin-6 (IL-6), B cell activating factor&#xD;
      (BAFF), and cluster of differentiation 44 (CD44). In addition, a number of cells have been&#xD;
      demonstrated to be involved in the plasma cell niche in either human or murine models,&#xD;
      including eosinophils, osteoclasts, bone marrow reticular cells, amongst others.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interruption of CXCR4/CXCL12 interactions with plerixafor has been used to induce cluster of&#xD;
      differentiation 34+ (CD34+) bone marrow stem cell mobilization into the peripheral blood.&#xD;
      Since the CXCR4/CXCL12 interaction is also thought to be responsible for plasma cells homing&#xD;
      to the bone marrow niche, it has been hypothesized that plerixafor may also provide systemic&#xD;
      mobilization of bone marrow niche resident plasma cells, or alternatively, may induce a local&#xD;
      mobilization from the bone marrow niche of plasma cells. Given that previous studies have&#xD;
      indicated that mobilization of long lived plasma cells is thought to result in short term&#xD;
      (less than 72 hour) survival of long lived plasma cells, this represents a significant&#xD;
      potential for enhancement of proteasome inhibitor-based plasma cell targeting therapies.&#xD;
      Indeed, a previous abstract from the oncology literature has provided preliminary evidence&#xD;
      that combined plerixafor and bortezomib therapy may be of use in mobilizing the malignant&#xD;
      myeloma cell from its bone marrow niche, thereby enhancing sensitivity to bortezomib.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of the proposed study is to conduct a proof of concept and preliminary safety&#xD;
      evaluation of plerixafor alone and also combined therapy with plerixafor and bortezomib. The&#xD;
      investigators have prospectively conducted a meticulous assessment of bortezomib-related&#xD;
      toxicities in both the transplant recipient AMR and the transplant candidate desensitization&#xD;
      populations and recently published this in Transplantation. This experience, which now&#xD;
      includes over 100 treated patients, indicates that the toxicity profile of bortezomib is&#xD;
      quite comparable to that which is observed in the myeloma population. The investigators'&#xD;
      preliminary analysis of plerixafor and bortezomib based toxicities demonstrates that there is&#xD;
      no significant degree of overlap in the toxicities and no significant reasons to have&#xD;
      concerns regarding combinatorial toxicities a priori.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators' extensive phase I/II study of bortezomib-based desensitization with and&#xD;
      without rituximab-based memory B-cell depletion and/or plasmapheresis has provided a&#xD;
      substantial experience as a first line approach for first generation plasma cell targeted&#xD;
      therapies for desensitization in kidney transplant candidates. The current proposal is the&#xD;
      first in the initiation of second generation plasma cell targeting protocols which have&#xD;
      substantial potential for applications beyond kidney transplant candidates. These types of&#xD;
      regimens may also lend themselves to AMR and desensitization in kidney transplant recipients&#xD;
      and also in heart and other solid organ transplant recipients. It is also possible that such&#xD;
      second generation plasma cell targeted protocols may also be of use for desensitization in&#xD;
      kidney transplant, heart transplant, and other solid organ transplant populations. Finally,&#xD;
      these plasma cell targeted therapies may also be of use in autoimmune diseases where&#xD;
      autoantibodies are thought to represent a major pathogenetic factor.&#xD;
