      BACKGROUND: In the initial Mild Hypothermia Randomized Control Trial (RCT), in collaboration&#xD;
      with the Organ Procurement and Transplant (OPTN) Region 5 Donor Management Goals (DMG)&#xD;
      Workgroup and Web Portal, the research team was able to conduct a multi-center RCT examining&#xD;
      the benefits of mild hypothermia in donors after neurologic determination of death (DNDDs) on&#xD;
      the outcomes of kidney transplantation. The trial was stopped early by the Data and Safety&#xD;
      Monitoring Board (DSMB) due to a significant positive benefit to kidney transplant&#xD;
      recipients, including a 38% reduction in the odds of delayed graft function (DGF, the primary&#xD;
      outcome measure of the trial). The results of this study have been published in the New&#xD;
      England Journal of Medicine (July 2015). This research offers a zero-cost intervention that&#xD;
      can substantially increase transplant success as well as the pool of potential donors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To expand upon the success of the hypothermia study, the team is conducting a new RCT to test&#xD;
      whether hypothermia is as effective as machine perfusion (MP) of kidneys from DNDDs. In an&#xD;
      RCT conducted by the Eurotransplant International Foundation in 2009 (Moers et al. NEJM), the&#xD;
      protective effect of MP (OR = 0.57) was similar to that found in the Mild Hypothermia Trial&#xD;
      (OR = 0.62). However, the cost of MP can be very significant for organ procurement&#xD;
      organizations (OPOs) and transplant centers. MP of kidneys from deceased donors has been&#xD;
      increasingly adopted by many centers even though clinical and cost effectiveness studies&#xD;
      remain uncertain in the United States. Between 2012 and 2014, out of 31,798 kidneys available&#xD;
      for transplant, 11,998 (38%) of them were machine perfused. Over the same three-year period,&#xD;
      the number of kidneys pumped annually increased by over 20%. This is an opportune time to&#xD;
      investigate the effectiveness of MP compared to mild hypothermia, as there are enough OPOs&#xD;
      currently using MP that if mild hypothermia was found to be a non-inferior intervention,&#xD;
      there would be considerable cost savings. Similarly, over 60% of kidneys do not receive&#xD;
      machine perfusion and findings that demonstrates a benefit of machine perfusion would likely&#xD;
      lead to rapid increase in use. In addition, DGF still occurs in up to 56% of high-risk&#xD;
      kidneys despite using one of these protective measures and their combined use may be the best&#xD;
      approach moving forward. Either way, a new evidence-based standard will be created that will&#xD;
      significantly affect the way kidney transplants are handled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODS: This will be a pragmatic multi-site randomized controlled trial that bases&#xD;
      enrollment on each OPO/Donation Service Area's current pumping criteria. There will be two&#xD;
      main groups of DNDDs,&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. those that are &quot;pump eligible&quot; based on current practice (this group typically resembles&#xD;
           traditional expanded criteria donors, but is increased in some areas) and&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. those that are lower risk and whose kidneys do not receive MP (&quot;not pump eligible&quot;).&#xD;
           Kidneys from donors who are considered&quot;pump eligible&quot; currently receive MP based on&#xD;
           their increased risk for failure. In this trial, &quot;pump eligible&quot; DNDDs will be&#xD;
           randomized to one of three groups&#xD;
&#xD;
      (1) normothermia (36.5-37.5 C) plus MP of both kidneys (standard of practice control group),&#xD;
      (2) mild hypothermia (34-35 C) plus MP of the left kidney only, and (3) mild hypothermia plus&#xD;
      MP of the right kidney only.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this manner, the same number of kidneys will be randomized to each of the three treatment&#xD;
      strategies (MP alone, mild hypothermia alone, or MP + hypothermia). It is important to note&#xD;
      that kidneys from &quot;pump eligible&quot;/higher risk DNDDs will still receive one form of protection&#xD;
      and possibly two.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In contrast, &quot;not pump eligible&quot; DNDDs will only be randomized to one of two groups: (1)&#xD;
      therapeutic mild hypothermia or (2) normothermia. Being that the Mild Hypothermia Trial was&#xD;
      stopped early for efficacy in the overall DNDD population, there was insufficient statistical&#xD;
      power to confirm a benefit in standard criteria donors (p=0.1 at stoppage). The purpose of&#xD;
      this arm of the trial is to validate the protective effect of hypothermia in a larger sample&#xD;
      size of lower-risk / &quot;not pump eligible&quot; donors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following objectives will be addressed by the trial:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Determine the non-inferiority of a hypothermia-only strategy to a standard pump-only strategy&#xD;
      in high risk DNDDs&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evaluate the superiority of a combined hypothermia+MP strategy to both hypothermia or MP&#xD;
      alone in high risk DNDDs&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evaluate the superiority of mild hypothermia versus standard of care normothermia in lower&#xD;
      risk, &quot;not pump eligible&quot; DNDDs&#xD;
&#xD;
      Determine the safety of the hypothermia strategy with respect to the function of&#xD;
      &quot;bystander&quot;organs (e.g., heart, lung)&#xD;
&#xD;
      This protocol has been approved by the OPTN Region 5 Research Committee. In addition, the&#xD;
      following steps have been or will be taken:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A National communication was sent via TransplantPro to allow for a two-week period for public&#xD;
      comment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Only donors whose families and/or advanced directives (donor registry) have authorized&#xD;
      research will be included in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All organ offers from DNDDs enrolled in the study will include a message in the Donor&#xD;
      Highlights section of DonorNetÂ®, a copy of the study summary will be attached to the record,&#xD;
      and allocation/transplantation will occur based on standard practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There will not be any interaction between the study team and the transplant recipients and no&#xD;
      additional data will be collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recipient graft function data will be derived from standard UNet forms and obtained from the&#xD;
      OPTN in a de-identified format.&#xD;
