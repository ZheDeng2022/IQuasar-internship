      The purpose of this study is to determine whether Riluzole is effective in the augmentation&#xD;
      treatment of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) that is experienced by Active Duty&#xD;
      military service members and Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF), Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF),&#xD;
      and Operation New Dawn (OND) veterans who have not had symptom reduction after one or more&#xD;
      kinds of medications or therapies.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Riluzole is a glutamatergic modulator that inhibits glutamate release and enhances AMPA&#xD;
      trafficking and clearance of excessive synaptic glutamate resulting in neuroprotective&#xD;
      properties. Riluzole is FDA-approved for the treatment of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS)&#xD;
      and has been found to have antidepressant and anxiolytic properties in animals and in humans&#xD;
      (Zarate et al., 2004). Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a chronic and seriously&#xD;
      debilitating anxiety disorder that develops following exposure to severe trauma, such as&#xD;
      combat exposure. Structural magnetic resonance imaging has been used to measure the volume of&#xD;
      crucial structures implicated in the pathophysiology of PTSD, with several morphometric&#xD;
      studies confirming smaller hippocampal volume in PTSD patients. Current pharmacological&#xD;
      treatment for PTSD, and particularly combat-related PTSD, is suboptimal. Drugs that alter&#xD;
      neuronal survival pathways through reduction of glutamate activity may play a role in&#xD;
      reversing the loss of neuronal integrity and possible focal atrophy in regions of the brain&#xD;
      implicated in the pathophysiology of PTSD, potentially improving the symptoms of PTSD, as&#xD;
      well as TBI. This study will evaluate the efficacy of acute riluzole treatment in active duty&#xD;
      and Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF), Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF), and Operation New Dawn&#xD;
      (OND) veterans with PTSD, with or without mild TBI (mTBI), who are sub-optimally responsive&#xD;
      to other medication treatments. A total of 158 active duty and OIF, OEF and OND veterans,&#xD;
      aged 18 to 65 will be enrolled from WRNMMC and the Syracuse VA Medical Center to participate&#xD;
      in this 8-week randomized, double- blind, placebo-controlled, parallel study. Patients who&#xD;
      are suboptimal responders to their current psychotropic drugs will continue these at stable&#xD;
      dosage for at least 2 weeks prior to randomization during the screening period. We&#xD;
      hypothesize that those subjects with PTSD, with or without mTBI, who are only partially&#xD;
      responsive to initial therapy and are subsequently randomized to augmentation therapy with&#xD;
      Riluzole (100-200mg/day) will have a superior response rate compared to those subjects&#xD;
      randomized to placebo.&#xD;

&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Female subjects of childbearing capacity who test positively for ÃŸ-HCG, or are either&#xD;
             self-reporting as pregnant, planning to become pregnant, or nursing.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Presence of psychotic features.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Unable to provide informed consent or comply with study procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Previous treatment with riluzole.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Serious, unstable illnesses including hepatic, renal, gastroenterological,&#xD;
             respiratory, cardiovascular (including ischemic heart disease), endocrinologic,&#xD;
             neurologic, immunologic, hematologic disease, or HIV. This includes individuals with a&#xD;
             history of COPD by diagnosis as well as persons taking inhalers for Asthma or Reactive&#xD;
             Airway Disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Clinically significant abnormal levels (3x ULN or greater) of serum transaminases&#xD;
             (ALT/SGPT; AST/SGOT), current or past blood dyscrasia.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Subjects with uncorrected hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. DSM-IV alcohol or substance abuse or dependence within 90 days of the screening visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Treatment with a reversible MAOI, guanethidine, or guanadrel within 1 week, or any&#xD;
             change in fluoxetine dosing within 8 weeks prior to visit 2. Use of antidepressant and&#xD;
             sedative/hypnotic drugs at stable dose is permitted.&#xD;

&#xD;
         11. Subjects with a current or past history of other axis I disorders including&#xD;

             with a co-morbid history of other Axis I disorder like major depression, dysthymia or&#xD;
             other anxiety disorders will be included; the justification for this is that&#xD;
             approximately 70% of subjects with PTSD have co-morbid depression and or alcohol&#xD;
             abuse, and restricting the sample to PTSD patients without depression will not&#xD;
             accurately reflect the scope of this disorder.&#xD;
&#xD;

             affirmative answer to the question: &quot;In the last three months, have you attempted to&#xD;
             kill yourself, made specific plans to kill yourself, or had the intention to kill&#xD;
             yourself?&quot;&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. Current or planned litigation regarding the traumatic event.&#xD;
&#xD;
         14. Patients who recently started trauma focused cognitive behavioral psychotherapy&#xD;
             (Patient's underlying educational or supportive individual or group therapy will be&#xD;
             included).&#xD;
&#xD;
         15. Patient's actively enrolled in an evidence based psychotherapy treatment (e.g.,&#xD;
             Cognitive Processing Therapy or Prolonged Exposure Therapy) will be excluded until&#xD;
             that therapy has concluded, but may be re-approached at that time if patient&#xD;
             self-report or clinician referral suggests persistent PTSD symptoms upon conclusion of&#xD;
             that treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
         16. Subjects with an artificial cardiac pacemaker or metallic implants within their body&#xD;
             will be enrolled at WRNMMC for the placebo-control clinical trial portion of the study&#xD;
             only. These individuals, due to their pre-existing medical condition, are medically&#xD;
             ineligible to participate in the 1H MRS imaging portion of the study. Further, the&#xD;
             Magnetic Resonance (MRI) Screening Form is use at WRNMMC will be used for participant&#xD;
             screening prior to any imaging procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
         17. Use of benzodiazepines.&#xD;
