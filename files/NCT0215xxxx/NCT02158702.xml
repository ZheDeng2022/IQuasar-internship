      Asian patients with relapsed myeloma after prior treatment with bortezomib and lenalidomide&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Myeloma patients who relapse after prior treatment with bortezomib and lenalidomide have&#xD;
      survival of less than 1 year. Recently, a randomized study of Pomalidomide and dexamethasone&#xD;
      conducted in compared with placebo and dexamethasone showed that pomalidomide can improve&#xD;
      survival of this group of patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pomalidomide is a new immunomodulatory drug which has been shown to be active in myeloma&#xD;
      patients who relapse after bortezomib and lenalidomide. A recent phase III study comparing&#xD;
      pomalidomide plus dexamethasone with placebo plus high dose dexamethasone in patients with&#xD;
      prior exposure to bortezomib and lenalidomide, showed that the use of pomalidomide&#xD;
      significantly improve the overall survival of these patients. However, this study did not&#xD;
      include Asian patients. Therefore the efficacy and toxicity of pomalidomide remains to be&#xD;
      described in Asian patients&#xD;
