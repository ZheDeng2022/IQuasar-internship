      This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of multiantigen deoxyribonucleic&#xD;
      acid (DNA) plasmid-based vaccine in treating patients with human epidermal growth factor&#xD;
      receptor 2 (HER2)-negative stage III-IV breast cancer. Multiantigen DNA plasmid-based vaccine&#xD;
      may target immunogenic proteins expressed in breast cancer stem cells which are the component&#xD;
      of breast cancer that is resistant to chemotherapy and has the ability to spread. Vaccines&#xD;
      made from DNA may help the body build an effective immune response to kill tumor cells.&#xD;

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study. Patients are assigned to 1 of 4 arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arm 1: Patients receive CD105/Yb-1/SOX2/CDH3/MDM2-polyepitope plasmid DNA vaccine with&#xD;
      recombinant human granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (rhuGM-CSF) as 1 injection&#xD;
      intradermally (ID) every 28 days for 3 months. Patients may also receive 2 additional booster&#xD;
      STEMVAC vaccines at 3 and 9 months after the third vaccine in the absence of unacceptable&#xD;
      toxicity or disease progression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM 2: Patients receive CD105/Yb-1/SOX2/CDH3/M2-polyepitope plasmid DNA vaccine with&#xD;
      rhuGM-CSF as 2 injections ID every 28 days for 3 months. Patients may also receive 2&#xD;
      additional booster STEMVAC vaccines at 3 and 9 months after the third vaccine in the absence&#xD;
      of unacceptable toxicity or disease progression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM 3: Patients receive CD105/Yb-1/SOX2/CDH3/MDM2-polyepitope plasmid DNA vaccine with&#xD;
      rhuGM-CSF as 3 injections ID every 28 days for 3 months. Patients may also receive 2&#xD;
      additional booster STEMVAC vaccines at 3 and 9 months after the third vaccine in the absence&#xD;
      of unacceptable toxicity or disease progression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM 4: Patients receive CD105/Yb-1/SOX2/CDH3/MDM2-polyepitope plasmid DNA vaccine with&#xD;
      rhuGM-CSF as 2 injections ID every 28 days for 3 months. Patients may also receive 1&#xD;
      additional STEMVAC vaccine at 3 months after the third vaccine in the absence of unacceptable&#xD;
      toxicity or disease progression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up twice yearly for up to 5 years.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Incidence of toxicity per Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 4.0</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 1 month after last vaccine</time_frame>
    <description>The type and grade of toxicities noted during the immunization regimen will be summarized. Adverse events noted by the investigator/designated clinical research staff will be tabulated according to the affected body system. Descriptive statistics will be used to summarize changes from baseline in clinical and/or laboratory parameters.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Immunologic efficacy defined as achievement of a statistically significant increase in Th1 cell immunity for at least 50% of the immunizing antigens as compared to baseline</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 5 years</time_frame>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Memory Th1 dominant immune response to all five antigens over time</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 12 months</time_frame>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Modulation of T-regulatory (Treg) cells with vaccination</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Treg defined as present or absent, and the probability will be estimated as a simple proportion.</description>

    <measure>Modulation of MDSC with vaccination</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>MDSC defined as present or absent, and the probability will be estimated as a simple proportion.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>STEMVAC specific Type 1 immune response</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Will detect if STEMVAC specific Type 1 immune response would be negatively correlated with the type II bacterial-tumor antigen (Bac-TA) specific responses. Statistical strategies will be used to assess the incidence and breadth of vaccine induced immunity as related to the levels of Bac-TA Th2 (Arm 4). For magnitude, the initial analysis could include two-tailed Pearson's correlation or even two tailed T tests between clear responder and non-responders. Specific organisms in the gut microbiome may prevent the development of tumor specific Type I immunity after vaccination, and will be evaluated by flow cytometry of peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Analysis could identify a blood based biomarker (Bac-TA responses) that could identify patients who would be less responsive to immune modulation and will be assessed by shotgun metagenomic sequencing.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Bac-TA cross-reactive T-cells</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Will evaluate whether organisms associated with Bac-TA cross-reactive T-cells are represented in the patient's microbiome. Will be assessed by collecting stool with the OMNIgene-GUT collection Kits (DNA Genotek) (Arm 4). Analysis could identify a blood based biomarker (Bac-TA responses) that could identify patients who would be less responsive to immune modulation and will be assessed by shotgun metagenomic sequencing.</description>
