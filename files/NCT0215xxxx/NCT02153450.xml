      This pilot clinical trial studies stereotactic radiosurgery and metformin hydrochloride in&#xD;
      treating patients with pancreatic cancer that may be removed (borderline-resectable) or not&#xD;
      removed by surgery. Stereotactic radiosurgery may be able to send x-rays directly to the&#xD;
      tumor and cause less damage to normal tissue. Metformin hydrochloride, used for diabetes, may&#xD;
      also kill cancer cells as demonstrated in laboratory studies. Giving stereotactic&#xD;
      radiosurgery with metformin hydrochloride may kill more tumor cells.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open label pilot, single-center, non-randomized trial is designed to evaluate the&#xD;
      tolerability and preliminary activity of the combination of stereotactic body radiation&#xD;
      therapy (SBRT) with metformin for resectable and locally-advanced pancreatic/periampullary&#xD;
      cancers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objectives of this study are to:&#xD;
&#xD;
      1) To determine if the addition of metformin to SBRT adds minimal additional toxicity for&#xD;
      patients with A). borderline-resectable or B). not surgically resectable pancreatic&#xD;
      adenocarcinomas.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Evaluate the clinical/pathological response and resectability rates associated with these&#xD;
      regimens.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive metformin hydrochloride orally (PO) daily or twice daily (BID) on days -11&#xD;
      to -1. Patients then undergo stereotactic radiosurgery 5 days a week for 5 weeks and receive&#xD;
      concurrent metformin hydrochloride* by mouth, two times a day for 5 weeks. Patients undergo&#xD;
      laparotomy on week 6 (or weeks 5-7). ). Systemic therapy continues as soon as it is&#xD;
      considered feasible by the treating physicians.&#xD;
&#xD;
      *NOTE: Metformin hydrochloride should be stopped 2 days before laparotomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 2 years.&#xD;
