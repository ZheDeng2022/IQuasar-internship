  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, study in subjects with&#xD;
      exercise-related knee pain/discomfort to determine the efficacy of a polyherbal capsule&#xD;
      compared to placebo capsule in improving exercise capacity and overall parameters of joint&#xD;
      health.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Subjects will come to the study site at Visit 1 for screening assessments (which will occur&#xD;
      within 14 days before the start of the run-in period) and to answer questions associated with&#xD;
      habitual diet, exercise capacity, and level of activity. Those subjects who meet initial&#xD;
      inclusion/exclusion criteria will undergo a run-in period of at least 7 days at home to&#xD;
      discontinue use of all concurrent dietary supplements. Subjects will then return to the study&#xD;
      site at Visit 2 (Baseline; Day 0) for further assessments and those meeting all&#xD;
      inclusion/exclusion criteria will be enrolled into the study and randomly assigned to study&#xD;
      product.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Approximately 108 subjects (54 per treatment group) will be enrolled in the study. Subjects&#xD;
      will be evaluated at Visit 3 (Day 14), Visit 4 (Day 45), Visit 5 (Day 60, phone call), and&#xD;
      Visit 6 (Day 90). Exercise capacity (ie, 6-minute timed walk distance test) will be assessed,&#xD;
      along with overall knee wellness and joint-related symptoms using WOMAC, PGA, Knee Pain&#xD;
      Rating Scale, and rescue medication usage. Safety will be assessed by collecting adverse&#xD;
      events (AEs) and clinical laboratory data.&#xD;

             including subjects who are bed or wheelchair-bound or those who have any physical&#xD;
             disability which could interfere with their ability to walk or perform the exercise&#xD;

             distance test.&#xD;
