    <textblock>
      The long-term purpose of the investigator's research is to understand the pathophysiological&#xD;
      basis of chronic pain. This will help provide a framework for the development of effective&#xD;
      treatments. The purpose of this specific study is to find if there are abnormal brain rhythms&#xD;
      in patients with fibromyalgia syndrome (FM) who are in pain since this will indicate&#xD;
      particular types of treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      FM is a disorder of the muscles and/or joints, and patients experience sever fatigue. FM&#xD;
      occurs more often in women than in men (3.4% of women, 0.5% of men). The diseases can appear&#xD;
      at any age, but in most of the cases it occurs in women of childbearing age. FM is considered&#xD;
      a chronic pain condition since the pain is persistent. Pain and tenderness can be widespread&#xD;
      throughout the body. FM patients are more sensitive to sound and pressure stimulation than&#xD;
      healthy controls, indicating that there may be changes in the brain. Also, pain is made worse&#xD;
      under conditions of stress.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatments for FM pain include life style changes such as exercise, dietary changes,&#xD;
      cognitive-behavioral therapy, medications and even surgery, but there is no accepted &quot;best&quot;&#xD;
      treatment. This is partly because the underlying cause of the pain is not well understood.&#xD;
      The design of this study is to record brain activity to find if there are abnormal brain&#xD;
      rhythms in people with FM that are not present in healthy adults of the same age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specifically, the investigators will test the hypothesis that constant low frequency&#xD;
      oscillations will be present in patients with chronic pain due to FM. This has been found in&#xD;
      people with other types of pain and is called Thalamocortical Dysrhythmia (TCD). The study&#xD;
      has two parts. In the first part, a complete medical history will be obtained, including a&#xD;
      description of the person's pain. In the second part the investigators will use&#xD;
      magnetoencephalography (MEG) to non-invasively record brain activity. The MEG data will be&#xD;
      analyzed in terms the presence of normal alpha rhythm and abnormal low and high frequency&#xD;
      oscillations. Each person will have an MRI so the investigators can localize the rhythms&#xD;
      recorded by the MEG in the person's brain using their MRI. The people who record and analyze&#xD;
      the MEG recordings will not know if the person is a healthy control or a FM patient. The two&#xD;
      parts will be joined to test the hypothesis and find if there is a correlation between the&#xD;
      people with abnormal low frequency brain rhythms and the presence or degree of pain.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The investigators will use magnetoencephalography (MEG) to non-invasively record brain&#xD;
      activity in women with fibromyalgia (FM) pain and in healthy subjects. The MEG data will be&#xD;
      analyzed in terms of the presence of normal alpha rhythm and abnormal low frequency and gamma&#xD;
      oscillations and their source in the person's brain using their MRI. The investigators will&#xD;
      use clinical evaluation, MEG recordings and MRI scans to achieve the following aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Determine if abnormal brain rhythms in the delta (&lt;4Hz) and theta (4-8Hz) frequency&#xD;
           bands are present in patients with FM while they are in pain. The hypothesis predicts&#xD;
           that such low frequency activity will be present in FM patients in pain, but not in&#xD;
           healthy controls or patients not in pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To determine if brain activity in the gamma (35-55Hz) frequency range is present in FM&#xD;
           patients. The hypothesis predicts that, in FM patients, areas of low frequency activity&#xD;
           will have an &quot;edge&quot; area of high frequency activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To determine if brain activity in the alpha (8-12Hz) frequency range is present in FM&#xD;
           patients and it if decreases in MEG recording made with the eyes open compared to&#xD;
           recordings with the eyes closed. Such normal activity is expected in both FM patients&#xD;
           and healthy controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To determine the location of the sources generating abnormal brain rhythms and normal&#xD;
           alpha rhythms in FM patients in pain and in healthy controls and patients not in pain.&#xD;
           The hypothesis predicts that low frequency regions with high frequency 'edges' will have&#xD;
           two locations: a) if the pain is localized, the somatosensory cortex in the region of&#xD;
           pain, b) the orbitofrontal cortex in portion of the pain pathway associated with the&#xD;
           emotional aspects of pain. The source of normal alpha rhythms in both patients and&#xD;
           controls will be localized to the posterior brain, particularly the visual cortex.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A multi-disciplinary treatment approach is taken for FM patients. This includes life style&#xD;
      changes such as exercise, dietary changes, cognitive-behavioral therapy as well as&#xD;
      medications and even surgery. There is no accepted &quot;best&quot; treatment, and not even a &quot;best&quot;&#xD;
      medication. This is partly because the underlying cause of the pain is not well understood.&#xD;
      The design of this study is to record brain activity to find if there are abnormal brain&#xD;
      rhythms in patients with FM that are not present in healthy adults of the same age. Such a&#xD;
      finding would inform more direct treatments that would be directed to the cause of the pain,&#xD;
      rather then the symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently, abnormal brain connectivity has been reported in FM patients (Napadow et al.,&#xD;
      2010). Also, activation of the frontal cortex, motor and cingulate brain regions has been&#xD;
      seen in FM patients during pain anticipation that were correlated with the subsequent pain&#xD;
      reported (Burgmer et al., 2010).&#xD;
&#xD;
      These results will be considered in the context of a comprehensive clinical evaluation to&#xD;
      determine if thalamocortical dysrhythmia (TCD) is present in patients in pain (Jeanmonod,&#xD;
      1993; Llinas et al, 1999, 2001, 2005). The investigators will also find if abnormal brain&#xD;
      rhythms are correlated with the presence and degree of pain and if there is a difference&#xD;
      between patients in pain and healthy adults.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Study Design. The investigators will follow a recent protocol used in our study of&#xD;
      abnormal rhythms in complex regional pain syndrome (Walton et al., 2010). Those who meet&#xD;
      criteria for inclusion but not exclusion will be enrolled in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. METHODS AND PROCEDURES&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Clinical Examination of Patients&#xD;
&#xD;
           Information collected during the clinical assessment will include:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Demographics: age, sex, employment status.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  A detailed history of fibromyalgia.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  A review of pain characteristics: location and severity, quality of pain, timing,&#xD;
                duration and context of pain, associated signs and symptoms, exacerbating factors,&#xD;
                alleviating factors, motor/sensory loss, and effect of activities of daily living.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  A complete medical history and important family medical history.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  A social history: tobacco, alcohol, and illicit drug use.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  A review of all concomitant medications.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Vital signs: blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate, height, weight.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  A physical exam.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Confirmation of the presence of the American College of Rheumatism's 1990 criteria&#xD;
                for fibromyalgia.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Completion of the following clinical assessments by the patient:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Visual Analogue Scale-average weekly recall of pain&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Pain Drawing for localization&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Patient's Global Assessment of Fibromyalgia&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Medical Outcomes Study Sleep Scale&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale&#xD;
&#xD;
           Healthy Controls will have the same procedures as the patients; Clinical Screening, MEG&#xD;
           and MRI.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. MEG recordings Informed consent will be obtained before the MEG recording. If it has&#xD;
           been obtained, this will be confirmed. (A member of the study team will bring a copy of&#xD;
           the signed informed consent before the MEG recording session.)&#xD;
&#xD;
           The head shape, including the location of the three fiducial markers (left and right&#xD;
           preauricular points, and the nasion) will be obtained for each subject using a 3D&#xD;
           tracking system by moving a stylus to each fiducial point and over the surface of the&#xD;
           head (Fastrak, Polhemus, Colchester, VT).&#xD;
&#xD;
           Each participant will be seated in the MEG instrument that is located inside a&#xD;
           multi-layer mu-metal magnetically shielded room. The location of the head will be&#xD;
           monitored at the beginning and end of each run using electrodes attached to the three&#xD;
           fiducial marker points used to obtain the head shape. Head position changes up to ≈0.5&#xD;
           cm will be accepted. (The same fiducial points will be used for the MRI to co-register&#xD;
           the MEG and MRI data.)&#xD;
&#xD;
           Each person will have three MEG recording sessions. Two MEGs will be recorded with the&#xD;
           eyes closed (EC), and one will be recorded with the eyes open (EO). Including the time&#xD;
           to fill out paperwork, measure their head shape, and the time between MEG recordings,&#xD;
           the investigators estimate that each participant will spend 60-90 minutes at the New&#xD;
           York University Center for Neuromagnetism.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Instructions to participants for MEG recordings. An investigator will explain that the&#xD;
           purpose of the recording is to look at brain activity while the patient is relaxed.&#xD;
           There will be three 7-minute recordings. The first will be with the eyes closed. They&#xD;
           will be told to please relax, but try not to fall asleep. Next, there will be a&#xD;
           recording period with the eyes open. They will be told to please try not to move the&#xD;
           eyes, but look at something the entire time. Third, there will another recording with&#xD;
           the eyes closed. The investigator will let the person know when the recording begins,&#xD;
           half way through each recording, and come in to see how they are doing after each&#xD;
           recording. The person will be asked to please try not to move the head during the&#xD;
           recordings.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Magnetoencephalography is FDA approved and is routinely used for brain mapping in&#xD;
           epilepsy and in pre-surgical patients and is standard of care in these cases (Shiraishi&#xD;
           et al., 2005; Makela et al., 2006). However, these recordings are being performed&#xD;
           exclusively for research purposes. Magnetic fields will be recorded using a 275-channel&#xD;
           whole-head MEG system (CTF Systems Inc., Port Coquitlam, British Columbia, Canada)&#xD;
           (McCubbin et al., 2004). A third-order software gradient (Weinberg et al., 1984) will be&#xD;
           used with a recording bandpass of 0.25-125 Hz.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Data Analysis and Data Monitoring. During each run magnetic fields will be recorded in&#xD;
           42 consecutive 10-sec trials. In this way, if the person moves during the session, the&#xD;
           10 sec trial during which this occurs can be eliminated from analysis. Neuromagnetic&#xD;
           fields will be recorded in the eyes-closed state to minimize signals from ocular muscles&#xD;
           and high-frequency visual system activation, and in the eyes-open and fixated state to&#xD;
           decrease the amplitude of the alpha-range (8-12 Hz) peak (and thereby better facilitate&#xD;
           the examination of spectrally proximal signals). Spectral analysis and independent&#xD;
           component analysis will be carried out as in our previous studies (Walton et al, 2010).&#xD;
&#xD;
      MRI and Source Reconstruction The purpose of the MRI (without contrast) is to provide an&#xD;
      anatomical image of the person's brain that will be used to localize the brain activity&#xD;
      recorded by the MEG. The MEG and MRI recordings must be co-registered so that they can be&#xD;
      aligned accurately. The same location markers, called fiducial markers (see above), must be&#xD;
      used for the MEG and the MRI. So, it is best if both recordings are done on the same day. The&#xD;
      MRI is after the MEG because the MEG instrument can detect magnetic field as small as 10-15&#xD;
      Tesla. The MRI generates a magnetic field that, although small, can be detected by the MEG&#xD;
      instrument and interferes with recording brain activity. The location of the three MEG&#xD;
      fiducials is marked using a fine point magic marker. The person is then escorted to the MRI&#xD;
      suit and the 3 MRI fiducials are put on the person using the magic marker points as guides.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All MRI scans will be carried out on the 3 T Alegra platform, due to its better&#xD;
      single-to-noise ration (SNR), spatial and spectral resolution, compared with the 1.5 T&#xD;
      instruments. Where MRI data is present the investigators will maintain a degree of uniformity&#xD;
      across experiments by performing MRI constrained modified minimum norm inverse modeling on&#xD;
      each data set. The MRI constrained inverse will be computed by assuming that the current&#xD;
      source density is confined to grey matter as segmented from the MRI data. Each subject's MRI&#xD;
      is segmented, and a tessellated cortical surface is reconstructed for each hemisphere using&#xD;
      the software FreeSurfer (Dale et al., 1999). These cortical surfaces are then sub-sampled to&#xD;
      create a sources pace of ~40,000 vertices. The lead field matrix, L, is computed for the&#xD;
      dipole moments normal to the cortical surface or for all components.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Potential biases or problems. A potential bias is during analysis of the MEG data. This will&#xD;
      be mitigated since the person analyzing the data will be blinded to the pain status of the&#xD;
      subject. Study subjects are identified by a code only in all data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedures, situations, or materials that may be hazardous. None.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3. Data Storage and Confidentiality. Trained staff will conduct interviews in a respectful&#xD;
      and sensitive manner. Records will be coded, stored and reviewed by participant number only.&#xD;
      These coded records will be kept in locked files in locked offices. Access to computer-based&#xD;
      data will be restricted by protection codes and login passwords, and all computers will be&#xD;
      kept in rooms with restricted access.&#xD;
