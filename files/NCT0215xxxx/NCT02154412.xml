      This clinical study is designed to investigate the mechanisms of blood pressure regulation&#xD;
      and respiratory motor function affected by spinal cord injury (SCI). We hypothesize that&#xD;
      impaired blood pressure regulation in individuals with chronic SCI can be improved by&#xD;
      restoring respiratory motor function by using Respiratory Motor Training (RMT).&#xD;

      Methods &amp; Procedures&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening spirometry will be performed with patient sitting in his/her personal wheelchair&#xD;
      using BreezeSuite System. Forced Vital Capacity (FVC) &amp; Forced Expiratory Volume in 1 second&#xD;
      (FEV1) will be obtained &amp; expressed as the percent of the predicted value for each subject&#xD;
      based on a database of neurologically intact individuals with no known pulmonary complaints&#xD;
      that was derived based on gender, age, &amp; height. Three acceptable spirograms will be obtained&#xD;
      &amp; the result of their best attempt will be used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening Orthostatic Stress Test will be conducted in patient placed on the cardiac chair&#xD;
      (Chair Hydraulics). The left hand will be placed in an arm sling &amp; kept at the level of the&#xD;
      heart throughout the study. Continuous beat-to beat arterial blood pressure will be acquired&#xD;
      from a finger cuff placed around the left middle or index finger (Portapres-2) in supine&#xD;
      position &amp; when the participants is moved into the upright seated position. Supine positions&#xD;
      will be maintained for 15 min. &amp; upright position will be maintained for 5 min. Baseline&#xD;
      values in supine position will be recorded during the last 5-min period just before changing&#xD;
      to the upright position. This test will be aborted if subjects become lightheaded or&#xD;
      symptomatic of syncope.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Spirometry &amp; Respiratory Muscle Strength Tests: Standard spirometry will be performed in&#xD;
      sitting position by using BreezeSuite System (MedGraphics). FVC &amp; FEV1 will be obtained.&#xD;
      MP45-36-871-350 Differential Pressure Transducer with UPC 2100 PC card &amp; software (Validyne&#xD;
      Engineering) will be used to measure the maximum inspiratory pressure (PImax) &amp; the maximum&#xD;
      expiratory pressure (PEmax) in sitting position. The PImax will be measured during maximal&#xD;
      inspiratory effort beginning at near residual volume &amp; PEmax will be measured during maximal&#xD;
      expiratory effort starting from near total lung capacity. Subjects will be asked to use a&#xD;
      three-way valve system with rubber tube as mouthpiece. The pressure meter incorporates a 1.5&#xD;
      mm diameter leak to prevent glottic closure &amp; to reduce buccal muscle contribution during&#xD;
      measurements. The assessment will require a sharp, forceful effort be maintained for a&#xD;
      minimum of 2 seconds. The maximum pressure will be taken as the highest value that sustained&#xD;
      for one second. The maximum value from three maneuvers that varied by less than 20% will be&#xD;
      averaged. Participants will be given specific instructions prior to the test &amp; will be&#xD;
      verbally coached throughout the spirometry &amp; respiratory muscle strength maneuvers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Orthostatic Stress Test:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each participant will be tested in the morning in a quiet, temperature-controlled (~22o C)&#xD;
      cardiovascular laboratory. Their diet will be restricted to exclude caffeine, alcohol &amp; foods&#xD;
      that are high in fat on the evening prior to &amp; the morning of the study. Participants will be&#xD;
      asked to empty their bladder before beginning the study. Continuous arterial BP will be&#xD;
      acquired from a finger cuff placed around the left middle or index finger or thumb&#xD;
      (Portapres-2;). The left hand will be placed in an arm sling &amp; kept at the level of the heart&#xD;
      throughout the study. Manual arterial BP measurements will be taken at the beginning of the&#xD;
      supine control period &amp; at the end of the recovery period with a digital blood pressure&#xD;
      measurement device. A 3-lead ECG will be placed for ECG monitoring. Rib cage &amp; abdomen&#xD;
      kinematics (respiratory kinematics) will be acquired using an inductive plethysmograph.&#xD;
      Baseline recording for 15 min. will begin after a 5-minute rest period that will follow&#xD;
      subject preparation. At the end of 15-minute recording in the supine position, participants&#xD;
      will be passively moved into the upright seated position. This position will be maintained&#xD;
      for 15 min. This test will be aborted if subjects become lightheaded or symptomatic of&#xD;
      syncope. Hemodynamic variables will be acquired at 1000 Hz using ML880 PowerLab System. ECG,&#xD;
      SBP &amp; DBP will be computed from continuous recording, &amp; all variables will be then&#xD;
      down-sampled to 5Hz. Beat-to-beat SBP, DBP, RR-interval &amp; HR will be also calculated from&#xD;
      acquired continuous BP &amp; ECG. All analyses will be done using Matlab. The Blood flow in the&#xD;
      heart will be measured by Cardiac Ultrasound using standard equipment by placing a sensor&#xD;
      above the heart.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood Catecholamines:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A butterfly catheter will be inserted into an antecubital vein during instrumentation to&#xD;
      allow the collection of blood without additional stress to the participant. Eight milliliters&#xD;
      of venous blood will be drawn from an antecubital vein at the end of 15-minute supine to&#xD;
      assess baseline epinephrine &amp; norepinephrine levels. Blood draw will be repeated at 3 &amp; at&#xD;
      the end of 15 min. of upright position to assess quick &amp; steady-state catecholamines&#xD;
      responses to orthostatic stress.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baroreflex evaluation: The last 5 min. of data acquired from each position will be used for&#xD;
      further analysis. The beat-to-beat time series of SBP &amp; RR intervals will be scanned for&#xD;
      three or more consecutive beats that independently contain increasing &amp; decreasing pressure&#xD;
      (SBP+, SBP-) &amp; RR interval (RR+, RR-) with minimum 1 mmHg SBP, &amp; 4 ms RR interval thresholds.&#xD;
      If an identified SBP sequence is followed by an identified RR sequence with delay of zero,&#xD;
      one, or two beats, those SBP &amp; RR sequences will be assigned as coupled. Only coupled&#xD;
      sequences with regression coefficient r&gt;0.90 will be accepted as a baroreflex sequences&#xD;
      (BRsq). The mean slope of all BRsq will be calculated &amp; taken as an estimation of baroreflex&#xD;
      sensitivity (BRS, ms/mmHg). The numbers of beats involved in SBP ramps &amp; BRsq will be&#xD;
      determined at each tilt position. The baroreflex effectiveness index (BEI) will be calculated&#xD;
      as the ratio between the total number of BRsq &amp; the total number of SBP ramps.&#xD;
&#xD;
      sEMG protocol: Electrical impulses originate in regulatory neurons, carried via motor nerves,&#xD;
      transmit through neuromuscular junction &amp; propagate throughout muscle membranes can be&#xD;
      recorded by surface electromyography (sEMG).This physiological test is often relied upon&#xD;
      during clinical pulmonary function testing &amp; in research, has been shown to be an accurate&#xD;
      reflection of the contractile strength of the respiratory muscles.We will use a multi-muscle&#xD;
      sEMG-based measure of motor output from the central nervous system recorded during voluntary&#xD;
      motor tasks attempted in the supine position under strictly controlled conditions that was&#xD;
      based on Brain Motor Control Assessment (BMCA) principles. The protocol consists of the&#xD;
      following voluntary maneuvers followed by 5 min. of quiet breathing: deep breath, PImax task&#xD;
      &amp; PEmax task. Each maneuver will be cued by an audible tone &amp; repeated three times. PImax &amp;&#xD;
      PEmax during these tasks will be maintained for a minimum of 5 seconds. Airway pressure will&#xD;
      be recorded simultaneously with sEMG using a three-way valve system with a pressure&#xD;
      transducer as described above. Surface EMG recordings will be accomplished with pairs of&#xD;
      recessed, FE9 silver-silver chloride cap surface electrodes (Grass Instruments, W Warwick,&#xD;
      RI) centered over the muscle &amp; placed 3 cm apart for each muscle recorded. Skin will be&#xD;
      prepared to reduce intra-electrode impedance. Right &amp; left upper portion of pectoralis (PEC),&#xD;
      6th intercostals (IC6), rectus abdominus (RA), &amp; obliquus abdominus (OBL) muscles will be&#xD;
      recorded. The ground electrode will be placed over the acromion process. sEMG will be&#xD;
      recorded using an Eclipse Neurological Workstation (Axon Systems Inc.). The incoming sEMG&#xD;
      signals will be amplified with a gain of 500, filtered at 30-1000 Hz &amp; sampled at 2000 Hz.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ultrasonic cardiac echography: Standard left ventricular echocardiograms in supine resting&#xD;
      state will be obtained measuring end-diastolic diameter (Dd) &amp; the end-systolic diameter&#xD;
      (Ds). Ten consecutive beats will be analyzed &amp; the mean will be used for cardiac output (Q)&#xD;
      calculations: Q= (Dd)3- (DS)3x HR 35.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Respiratory Muscle Training:&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the training session, subjects will be seated in their personal wheelchair with an&#xD;
      approximately 45° head-up tilt. A threshold Positive Expiratory Pressure Device &amp; a threshold&#xD;
      Inspiratory Muscle Trainer with flanged mouthpiece will be used for a range of 20 to 41 cm&#xD;
      H2O. These devices will be assembled together using a T-shaped connector (Airlife 001504).&#xD;
      The participants will be instructed to perform maximal inspiratory &amp; expiratory efforts&#xD;
      against a pressure load. During inhalation, the subjects will be instructed to initiate each&#xD;
      breath from residual volume (RV) &amp; to sustain the effort until their lungs feel full. During&#xD;
      exhalation, the subjects will be instructed to breathe from total lung capacity &amp; sustain&#xD;
      their effort until their lungs feel empty. Participants will be asked to train 45 min. per&#xD;
      day, 5 days per week, for 4 weeks. The training will be initiated with a load equal to 20% of&#xD;
      their individual PImax &amp; PEmax with progressive increases as tolerated up to 40% of their&#xD;
      baseline PImax or PEmax. The goal will be to have all patients training at 40% of PImax &amp;&#xD;
      PEmax during the last week of the training. An interval training protocol will be used with&#xD;
      patients performing six work sets, 5 min. in duration, separated by rest intervals lasting&#xD;
      1-3 min.. A research team member will monitor all training sessions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preliminary results showed that RMT will increase FVC, FEV1, PImax &amp; PEmax in experimental&#xD;
      subjects compared to pre-training values. The biggest effect is expected for expiratory&#xD;
      values (FEV1, &amp; PEmax). One reason for this might be the fact that expiratory function, the&#xD;
      most limited after SCI, has bigger window for change. Our results showed that average&#xD;
      increase of 8-9% with a sample size of 24-26 patients could reveal a significant difference&#xD;
      with a power of 80-86% in all spirometrical values.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2. Improvement in the BP &amp; mechanisms associated with blood pressure changes were&#xD;
      assessed using the low-frequency component of power spectral density of systolic (SBP) &amp;&#xD;
      diastolic (DBP) blood pressure values &amp; amount of catecholamines measured in blood levels.&#xD;
      Based on preliminary findings small changes are expected in the resting BP values after&#xD;
      training. However, after training, the increase in SBP when position is changed to sit-up is&#xD;
      expected to be strong with low variability. The calculations showed that even with n=20, the&#xD;
      power will be 84% &amp; when n=24, it will be increased to 94%. Changes in DBP are expected to be&#xD;
      lower with power of 80% for n=24. Similar values were obtained when low frequency modulations&#xD;
      of SBP &amp; DBP were analyzed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to this analysis, number of subjects from 20 to 24 will result in significant&#xD;
      increase with 87% power. The effectiveness &amp; sensitivity of the baroreflex both improved&#xD;
      after training in the preliminary study. After training, in response to the orthostatic&#xD;
      stress, a substantial increase in baroreflex responsiveness was obtained &amp; a power of 83%&#xD;
      will result with a sample size of 24. The baroreflex sensitivity exhibited much higher&#xD;
      variability. If variability remains high in the proposed study, the power of achieving a&#xD;
      significant difference from pre-to post-training is 83% with a sample size of 28 patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, a decrease in variability is very likely with a larger sample size &amp; the power&#xD;
      increases to 86% with a sample of 24 patients with a 32% decrease in variability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on the results of test-re-test recordings in 10 SCI subjects, the matched number of&#xD;
      untrained subjects (n=12) will be enough to form a control group. The deviations from the&#xD;
      means were found to be so low, that it would be impossible to reach significance with a&#xD;
      reasonable sample size for this group.&#xD;
