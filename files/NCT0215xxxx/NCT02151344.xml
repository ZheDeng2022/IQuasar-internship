    <textblock>
      H7N9 viruses have caused a recent outbreak of severe illness in humans in China. The purpose&#xD;
      of this study is to evaluate the safety and immune response of an H7N9 A/Anhui/13 ca&#xD;
      influenza virus vaccine followed by an inactivated subvirion H7N9 vaccine at varying&#xD;
      intervals.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      H7N9 avian influenza (AI) viruses have been responsible for a recent outbreak of illness in&#xD;
      humans in China, which was associated with severe respiratory illnesses resulting in acute&#xD;
      respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and intensive care unit (ICU) admissions. The purpose of&#xD;
      this study is to evaluate the safety, infectivity, and immunogenicity of a live attenuated&#xD;
      H7N9 A/Anhui/13 cold adapted (ca) influenza virus vaccine followed by a boost with an&#xD;
      inactivated subvirion H7N9 vaccine at varying intervals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will enroll participants into five cohorts. Participants in Cohorts 1, 2, 3, and 4&#xD;
      will be admitted to an isolation unit on Study Day -2. On Study Day 0, participants will&#xD;
      receive one dose of the H7N9 A/Anhui/13 ca influenza virus vaccine via a nose spray device.&#xD;
      While in the isolation unit, participants will undergo a physical examination and nasal wash&#xD;
      each day, and a blood collection on select days. Participants will remain in the isolation&#xD;
      unit for at least 9 days after receiving the vaccine, but possibly longer, depending on their&#xD;
      test results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants in Cohorts 1 and 2 will return to the isolation unit 4 to 8 weeks after&#xD;
      receiving the first vaccine (at approximately Day 28). They will receive the second dose of&#xD;
      the H7N9 A/Anhui/13 ca influenza virus vaccine and repeat all of the same procedures that&#xD;
      occurred after the first vaccination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will then receive one dose of the inactivated subvirion H7N9 vaccine 1 month&#xD;
      (Cohort 1) or 2 months (Cohort 2) after receiving the second vaccine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants in Cohorts 3 and 4 will receive the inactivated subvirion H7N9 vaccine either 1&#xD;
      month (Cohort 4) or 2 months (Cohort 3) after receiving one dose of the live attenuated&#xD;
      vaccine. For Cohorts 1-4, participants study visits will occur 7, 14, 28, and 90 days after&#xD;
      receiving the vaccine and will include a medical history review, physical examination, and&#xD;
      blood collection at select visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants in Cohort 5 will receive one dose of the inactivated subvirion H7N9 vaccine at&#xD;
      Day 0 and one dose at Day 28. Study visits will occur on Days 0, 7, 28, 35, 42, 56, and 118,&#xD;
      and will include blood collections and physical examinations. Participants in Cohort 5 will&#xD;
      not be admitted to the isolation unit.&#xD;
