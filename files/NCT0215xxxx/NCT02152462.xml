      Overview: This is a 6 month, two-arm randomized clinical trial using comparing exergaming to&#xD;
      a control group. The investigators will randomize Black sedentary overweight/obese women to&#xD;
      Wii Fit exercise (n=50) or the control arm (n=50). Women in the Wii Fit exercise group will&#xD;
      come to the Georgetown community-based exercise facility 3 days/wk. The control group will be&#xD;
      asked to maintain their current daily activities and not to exercise for the duration of the&#xD;
      study. Based on the investigators previous findings that women who engage in 75-150 mins/wk&#xD;
      of brisk walking had an 18% decreased risk of breast cancer, the investigators will target&#xD;
      this level of activity in the investigators intervention arm. Also, this 150 min/week of&#xD;
      physical activity meets the current recommendations of the American College of Sports&#xD;
      Medicine (ACSM) and the US Department of Health and Human Services for healthy individuals&#xD;
      and is in line with recommendation of the American Cancer Society (ACS) for cancer&#xD;
      prevention.&#xD;

      1. * Purpose of project (one or two sentences): To examine the feasibility and&#xD;
           acceptability of an exergaming intervention in a community-based setting, and to explore&#xD;
           the effects of exergaming on cardiovascular fitness, body mass index and percent body&#xD;
           fat in Black women who are sedentary and overweight or obese.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. * Study design (for example, hypothesis, research questions, standard and experimental&#xD;
           procedures/drugs/devices or equipment, etc.):&#xD;
&#xD;
      Overview: This is a 6 month, two-arm randomized clinical trial using comparing exergaming to&#xD;
      a control group. The investigators will randomize Black sedentary overweight/obese women to&#xD;
      Wii Fit exercise (n=50) or the control arm (n=50). Women in the Wii Fit exercise group will&#xD;
      come to the Georgetown community-based exercise facility 3 days/wk. The control group will be&#xD;
      asked to maintain their current daily activities and not to exercise for the duration of the&#xD;
      study. Based on the investigators previous findings that women who engage in 75-150 mins/wk&#xD;
      of brisk walking had an 18% decreased risk of breast cancer, the investigators will target&#xD;
      this level of activity in the investigators intervention arm. Also, this 150 min/week of&#xD;
      physical activity meets the current recommendations of the American College of Sports&#xD;
      Medicine (ACSM) and the US Department of Health and Human Services for healthy individuals&#xD;
      and is in line with recommendation of the American Cancer Society (ACS) for cancer&#xD;
      prevention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exercise Intervention: Participants in the Wii Fit exergaming group will have a goal of 150&#xD;
      min/wk of moderate intensity exercise for the last 5 mo of the 6 mo intervention. Heart rate&#xD;
      (HR) monitors will quantify exercise intensity. Participants will exercise at a HR equal to&#xD;
      45-65% of their maximal oxygen consumption (VO2max). Given the expected VO2max values for&#xD;
      this population, the investigators project that the Wii Fit videogames must elevate energy&#xD;
      expenditure to 3-4 times resting metabolic rate to achieve the desired HR responses. As&#xD;
      summarized above, previous studies have shown that such an elevation in energy expenditure&#xD;
      can be expected from these activities. Wii Fit stations with a variety of active games will&#xD;
      be available to participants at the Georgetown University Community Based Office.&#xD;
      Participants will be instructed by the exercise physiologist on how to achieve the required&#xD;
      HR. The training will consist of 3 days/wk of supervised Wii Fit physical activity. Exercise&#xD;
      duration will increase gradually from 75 to 150 min/wk by wk 477. Thereafter, women will&#xD;
      maintain &gt;150 min/wk of moderate-intensity physical activity. Participants will complete&#xD;
      daily exercise diaries recording the type and duration of physical activity, and HR.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Control Group: After baseline testing the control group will be asked to maintain their&#xD;
      current daily activities for the duration of the study. The control group will have the&#xD;
      option to exercise at the Wii Fit stations following their completion of the study. They will&#xD;
      receive the same measures as the exercise group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Diet: Participants in both groups will be instructed to maintain their diet constant&#xD;
      throughout the study. Wii Fit intervention participants will be weighed at every session and&#xD;
      those losing more weight than could be accounted for by their exercise will be counseled to&#xD;
      return to their caloric intake at the start of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      * Rationale and justification for study (i.e. historical background, investigator's personal&#xD;
      experience, pertinent medical literature, etc.): Several risk factors have been identified&#xD;
      that increase breast cancer risk, some of which are non-modifiable factors (e.g., age, family&#xD;
      history, and race) and some of which are modifiable (e.g., physical activity, body weight,&#xD;
      dietary habits, and alcohol intake). However, only within the last 10 years have cancer&#xD;
      organizations started to recommend physical activity as a preventive measure for breast&#xD;
      cancer. The American Cancer Society (ACS) and the International Agency for Research on Cancer&#xD;
      of the World Health Organization now both recommend regular physical activity as a strategy&#xD;
      for women to reduce their risk of developing breast cancer. Specific recommendations for&#xD;
      breast cancer prevention, which initially focused on diet, are now focused on maintaining a&#xD;
      healthy weight throughout life by balancing caloric intake while increasing caloric&#xD;
      expenditure via increased physical activity levels, and losing weight if overweight or obese.&#xD;
      Obesity itself is a significant public health problem and is associated with increased&#xD;
      postmenopausal breast cancer incidence and mortality. This research proposal will assess a&#xD;
      novel method to improve physical activity in African American women, who are generally less&#xD;
      physically active and more overweight and obese than women of most other racial and ethnic&#xD;
      groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Treatment Plan:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participants in the Wii Fit exergaming group will be encouraged to meet and then maintain&#xD;
      a goal of 150 min/wk of moderate intensity exercise for 6 months. Goals per individual will&#xD;
      be based on their baseline data. Exercise duration will increase gradually from 75 min/wk at&#xD;
      week 1 to 150 min/wk by week 4. Thereafter, women will maintain &gt;150 min/wk of&#xD;
      moderate-intensity physical activity. The training will consist of 3 days/wk of supervised&#xD;
      physical activity using Nintendo Wii Fit active videogames.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will exercise at a HR equal to 45-65% of their VO2max. Given the expected VO2max&#xD;
      values for this population, the investigators project that the Wii Fit videogames will&#xD;
      elevate energy expenditure to 3-4 times resting metabolic rate to achieve the desired HR&#xD;
      responses. As summarized above, previous studies have shown that such an elevation in energy&#xD;
      expenditure can be expected from these activities. Participants will be instructed to monitor&#xD;
      their physical activity in order to assist with their perceived behavioral control and&#xD;
      increase self-efficacy towards meeting their goals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During aerobic exercise sessions, participants will wear Polar heart rate monitors to&#xD;
      determine exercise intensity and will be given instruction by the exercise physiologist on&#xD;
      how achieve the required HR. In addition, participants will complete daily exercise diaries&#xD;
      to record the type and duration of physical activity, and exercise HR. Because many women may&#xD;
      not have access to gym memberships or be able to afford expensive exercise equipment, the&#xD;
      investigators address this environmental barrier by establishing Wii Fit stations with a&#xD;
      variety of active games available to participants at the Community Based Office.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exergames selected for use during the exercise sessions will be chosen based on energy&#xD;
      expenditure data. Those active videogames that have been shown to achieve energy expenditure&#xD;
      levels above those necessary to achieve 60% HRmax in the investigators specific study&#xD;
      population will be selected. For example, active videogames tested in published studies, such&#xD;
      as Wii Fit boxing and Dance Dance Revolution, have been found to achieve physical activity&#xD;
      levels of moderate intensity (3.0-6.0 METs), which meet American College of Sports Medicine&#xD;
      guidelines for health and fitness. Graves et al. (2008), for example found physical activity&#xD;
      levels to reach 68% of maximal heart rate (HRmax) using the Wii Fit which also meets ACSM&#xD;
      aerobic fitness recommendations (60% HRmax).&#xD;
