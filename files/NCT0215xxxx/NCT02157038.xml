  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is investigating whether changes in the shape and size of bodily muscles and&#xD;
      spinal cord anatomy can influence recovery rates following a motor vehicle collision (MVC).&#xD;
      The objective is to demonstrate that the presence of muscle and spinal cord degeneration and&#xD;
      associated muscle weakness is the consequence of a mild MVC-related injury involving the&#xD;
      cervical spinal cord.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Whiplash is a condition that consists of patients that display varying degrees of pain and&#xD;
      disability. Most patients should expect full-recovery within the first 2-3 months post&#xD;
      injury. At the other end of the spectrum is a group of patients (~ 25%) who continue to have&#xD;
      moderate-severe pain-related disability in the long-term. Reasons for this transition to&#xD;
      chronicity are largely unknown. The situation would benefit if there were radiological&#xD;
      findings of the disorder. However, clear and consistent findings of injured tissues on&#xD;
      standard radiological exams remain elusive.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As part of this study, the investigators will innovatively investigate measures to 1)&#xD;
      quantify the temporal development of widespread muscle degeneration, 2) identify quantifiable&#xD;
      markers of altered cervical spinal cord physiology, 3) quantify reductions in central&#xD;
      activation and fatigue 4) evaluate potential genetic variants that may be associated with&#xD;
      chronic pain after a MVC and 5) determine the mediational influence of psychosocial factors&#xD;
      on recovery rates following whiplash injury, as a potential mechanism underlying the&#xD;
      transition to chronic pain.&#xD;
