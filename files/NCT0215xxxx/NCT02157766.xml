  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Wisconsin Center for the Neuroscience and Psychophysiology of Meditation will be a highly&#xD;
      focused center dedicated to novel and cutting edge research on the mechanisms by which&#xD;
      meditation works. The core set of hypotheses for this Center focus on the mechanisms of two&#xD;
      common meditation practices: Mindfulness Meditation (MM) and Loving-Kindness/Compassion&#xD;
      Meditation (LKM-CO), both taught in Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR). The&#xD;
      investigators will study both Long-Term Meditators (LTMs) as well as meditation-naïve&#xD;
      participants (MNPs). The latter group will be randomly assigned to MBSR, a rigorously matched&#xD;
      comparison intervention called the Health Enhancement Program (HEP; MacCoon et al., 2012), or&#xD;
      to a Wait List (WL) control group. This will give us a comprehensive view of changes that are&#xD;
      produced by meditation practices per se, changes generically associated with interventions&#xD;
      designed to promote well-being, and changes that might be effects of repeating testing&#xD;
      protocols across multiple occasions. In addition, the inclusion of both novice and&#xD;
      experienced meditators provides a wide range of practice experience that will provide&#xD;
      critical information on dose-related effects, information that is lacking in the research&#xD;
      literature today.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each of the projects is focused on examining the brain mechanisms and peripheral biological&#xD;
      correlates of meditation. Project 1 (Davidson) will examine the impact of the explicit use of&#xD;
      mindfulness and loving-kindness/compassion strategies on emotion regulation, specifically&#xD;
      neural, biobehavioral and hormonal indices of reactivity to and recovery from pictures of&#xD;
      human suffering and flourishing. Project 2 (Rosenkranz) will investigate the brain to&#xD;
      periphery pathways through which psychological factors contribute to the expression of asthma&#xD;
      symptoms. In addition, it will examine the efficacy of meditation training in reducing the&#xD;
      inflammatory response to an allergen in asthmatic individuals by reducing the reactivity of&#xD;
      emotion-related neural circuitry. Project 3 (Tononi) will examine whether the previously&#xD;
      reported increase in gamma oscillations during Non-REM (NREM) sleep in meditators is&#xD;
      associated with changes in sleep mentation (Ferrarelli et al. 2013). In addition, project 3&#xD;
      will examine relations between meditation-induced changes in brain activity during sleep and&#xD;
      brain activity and cognitive function during wakefulness.&#xD;
