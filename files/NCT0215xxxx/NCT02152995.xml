    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well trametinib works in increasing tumoral iodine&#xD;
      incorporation in patients with thyroid cancer that has come back or spread to another place&#xD;
      in the body. Trametinib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes&#xD;
      needed for cell growth and may help make treatment with iodine I-131 more effective.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate the effect of trametinib on enhancing radioiodine (RAI) activity by&#xD;
      determining the proportion of patients alive at 6 months without disease progression by&#xD;
      Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors version 1.1 (RECIST version [v]1.1) criteria&#xD;
      following treatment with RAI in co-administration with trametinib. (Cohort A) II. To evaluate&#xD;
      the effect of trametinib on enhancing RAI activity by determining the objective response rate&#xD;
      (ORR) at 6 months following treatment with radioiodine (RAI) in co-administration with&#xD;
      trametinib. (Cohort A) III. To determine the proportion of patients following trametinib&#xD;
      therapy with increased tumoral iodine incorporation as quantified by iodine iodine-124&#xD;
      (I-124) positron emission tomography (PET)/computed tomography (CT) lesional dosimetry.&#xD;
      (Cohort B)&#xD;

      (Cohort B) X. Preliminary evaluation of best objective response (BOR) rate for patients&#xD;
      treated with trametinib alone. (Exploratory) (Cohort C) XI. Preliminary evaluation of the&#xD;
      proportion of patients following treatment with trametinib alive at 6 months without disease&#xD;
      progression by RECIST v 1.1 criteria. (exploratory) (Cohort C) XII. To evaluate the&#xD;
      safety/tolerability of trametinib. (Cohort C) XIII. To evaluate changes in thyroglobulin&#xD;
      levels in patients treated with trametinib. (Cohort C) XIV. To explore potential correlations&#xD;
      between genomic alterations present in the tumor and/or tumoral pharmacodynamic changes&#xD;
      induced by trametinib to clinical outcomes. (Exploratory) (Cohort C) XV. To explore the&#xD;
      impact of continued trametinib upon RAI avidity and efficacy. (Exploratory) (Cohort C)&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients undergo iodine I-124 PET/CT on day 5 of week 1. Beginning day 6, patients receive&#xD;
      trametinib orally (PO) daily for 4 weeks in the absence of disease progression or&#xD;
      unacceptable toxicity. Patients undergo second iodine I-124 PET/CT on week 5. If I-124 PET/CT&#xD;
      shows enough iodine absorption, patients may receive iodine I-131 PO and continue receiving&#xD;
      trametinib for another 2 days. If I-124 shows that the thyroid is not absorbing iodine,&#xD;
      patients may continue trametinib at the doctor's discretion and do not receive iodine I-131.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 30 days.&#xD;

                  tumor is accessible for biopsy or that biopsy poses too great of a risk to the&#xD;
                  patient (if the only tumor accessible for biopsy is also the only lesion that can&#xD;
                  be used for RECIST v1.1 response evaluation, then the patient may be exempt from&#xD;
                  biopsy after discussion with the MSK principal investigator)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  The goal will be to have a minimum of 6 patients from Cohort A and 3 patients&#xD;
                  from Cohort B attempt to have one or both of these research biopsies done (for a&#xD;
                  total of 9 patients total); accrual may be limited only to subjects for whom&#xD;
                  tumor is accessible for biopsy and attempt at biopsy is considered safe if&#xD;
                  continued enrollment of those who are not candidates for biopsy make it&#xD;
                  impossible to reach the accrual goals for research biopsies described above&#xD;
                  (e.g., if 19 [of 25] patients are accrued to Cohort A without any biopsies having&#xD;
                  been obtained within the cohort, then all further subjects who are registered to&#xD;
                  that cohort must qualify for attempted research biopsy in order to be enrolled&#xD;
                  into the study [i.e., subjects who would have been excluded from having biopsies&#xD;
                  done due to the above reasons would be excluded from participating in the study;&#xD;
                  these conditions also apply to Cohort B])&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Availability of archival tumor tissue from the thyroid cancer primary or metastasis (a&#xD;
             tissue block or a minimum of 30 unstained slides would be required; patients with less&#xD;
             archival tissue available may still be eligible for the study after discussion with&#xD;
             the MSK principal investigator)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  COHORT A: Confirmation in a Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA)&#xD;
             certified laboratory that one of the patient's thyroid tumors (primary tumor,&#xD;
             recurrent tumor, or metastasis) has an neuroblastoma RAS viral (v-ras) oncogene&#xD;
             homolog (NRAS) or Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog (KRAS) or Harvey rat&#xD;
             sarcoma viral oncogene homolog (HRAS) mutation at G12, G13, or Q61; this group of&#xD;
             patients will also be referred to as &quot;RAS MUT&quot;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  COHORT A: Patients must have progressive disease, defined as the presence of new or&#xD;
             growing lesion(s) on radiologic imaging within 14 months of study enrollment and/or&#xD;
             new/worsening disease related symptoms within 14 months of study enrollment;&#xD;
             (progression according to RECIST v 1.1 criteria is not required)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  COHORT B: Confirmation in a CLIA certified laboratory that one of the patient's&#xD;
             thyroid tumors (primary tumor, recurrent tumor, or metastasis) does not have any of&#xD;
             the following mutations:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Mutation at V600 of the v-raf murine sarcoma viral oncogene homolog B (BRAF) gene&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Mutation in NRAS or KRAS or HRAS at G12, G13, or Q61&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  These patients will be designated &quot;BRAF/RAS wild type (WT)&quot;&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of another malignancy; exception: patients who have been disease-free for 3&#xD;
             years, patients with a history of completely resected non-melanoma skin cancer, and/or&#xD;
             patients with indolent secondary malignancies, are eligible; MSK can consult the&#xD;

                  appetite stimulant is allowed; thyroid-stimulating hormone [TSH] suppressive&#xD;
                  therapy is also allowed; palliative radiation therapy to non-target lesions is&#xD;
                  also allowed)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Concurrent treatment with bisphosphonates is permitted; prophylactic use of&#xD;
                  bisphosphonates in patients without bone disease is not permitted, except for the&#xD;
                  treatment of osteoporosis&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Because the composition, pharmacokinetics (PK), and metabolism of many herbal&#xD;
                  supplements are unknown, the concurrent use of all herbal supplements is&#xD;
                  prohibited during the study (including, but not limited to, St. John's wort,&#xD;
                  kava, ephedra [ma huang], gingko biloba, dehydroepiandrosterone [DHEA], yohimbe,&#xD;

                  randomization are eligible)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  History of acute coronary syndromes (including myocardial infarction and unstable&#xD;
                  angina), coronary angioplasty, or stenting within 6 months prior to randomization&#xD;

             virus (HCV) infection (with the exception of chronic or cleared HBV and HCV infection,&#xD;
             which will be allowed); patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) are not&#xD;
             eligible if on anti-retroviral medications&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active&#xD;
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac&#xD;
             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with&#xD;
             study requirements&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Animal reproductive studies have not been conducted with trametinib; therefore, the&#xD;
             study drug must not be administered to pregnant women or nursing mothers; these&#xD;
             potential risks may also apply to RAI and Thyrogen&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  HIV-positive patients on combination antiretroviral therapy are ineligible because of&#xD;
             the potential for pharmacokinetic interactions with trametinib; in addition, these&#xD;
             patients are at increased risk of lethal infections when treated with&#xD;
             marrow-suppressive therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients unable to follow a low iodine diet or requiring medication with high content&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Patients who received iodinated intravenous contrast as part of a radiographic&#xD;
             procedure within 3 months of study registration; those that have had iodinated&#xD;
             intravenous contrast within this time frame may still be eligible if a urinary iodine&#xD;
             analysis reveals that the excess iodine has been cleared after the last intravenous&#xD;
             contrast administration&#xD;
