  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is known that low vitamin D status is a very common problem in the UK. It is also known&#xD;
      that a lack of vitamin D availability has potentially serious health implications, especially&#xD;
      with respect to bone and muscle function. Much research has recently taken place to establish&#xD;
      the vitamin D requirements of key population groups (i.e. pregnant women, the elderly, ethnic&#xD;
      minorities). However few data are available describing the vitamin D requirements for male&#xD;
      and female adolescents. The period of adolescence is a key stage of growth and development -&#xD;
      poor nutrition during this time can have detrimental health consequences for a lifetime.&#xD;
&#xD;
      No intervention studies have comprehensively investigated the vitamin D requirements of&#xD;
      adolescents. The proposed ODIN Study will enable a better understanding of how adolescents&#xD;
      respond to vitamin D supplementation and the most effective daily amount that will raise and&#xD;
      maintain vitamin D status in adolescents during the winter-time. In addition, investigations&#xD;
      into the mechanisms of action with respect to any differences observed across the doses of&#xD;
      vitamin D and between the genders of the participants will also provide key information.&#xD;
      Mechanisms of action will focus on genetic differences as well as differences in vitamin D&#xD;
      metabolising enzymes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The results obtained from this significant study will not only inform the European Food&#xD;
      Standards Agency (EFSA) with respect to their imminent deliberations regarding vitamin D&#xD;
      recommendations. The ODIN Study will also inform the UK Department of Health's Scientific&#xD;
      Advisory Committee on Nutrition (SACN), the wider scientific community and be a critical&#xD;
      resource for key stakeholders (i.e. food industry, government health agencies) to collaborate&#xD;
      in determining future public health strategies, thus potentially positively impacting on the&#xD;
      health of the population for years to come.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators propose that the daily supplementation of 10µg/day (400 IU) and 20µg/day&#xD;
      (800 IU) of vitamin D3 for five months will meet the vitamin D requirements of males and&#xD;
      females aged 14-18 year and will be sufficient to maintain winter-time 25OHD levels above a&#xD;
      range of thresholds between 30 and 50nmol/l.&#xD;

    <time_frame>Baseline and after 5 months of supplementation</time_frame>
    <description>To investigate the mechanisms (genetic/enzymatic) underlying the differences observed in the preceding objective via genotyping the participants for polymorphisms related to vitamin D metabolism. Secondary analyses will include evaluation of variations in the response to supplementation by single SNP variations and by the genetic vitamin D risk score. To determine, through transcriptomic (global mRNA) analysis of leukocyte samples, genome-wide differences in gene expression, in the adolescents in response to the vitamin D3 supplementation.</description>
