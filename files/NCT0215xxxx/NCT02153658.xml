      The PrePex is a WHO prequalified medical device for adult male circumcision for HIV&#xD;
      prevention. The Government of Rwanda was the first country to implement the PrePex and acts&#xD;
      as the leading Center of Excellence providing trainings and formal guidelines. As part of the&#xD;
      Government's efforts to improve the PrePex implementation, it made efforts to improve the&#xD;
      psychology acceptability of the PrePex by men and thus to increase the uptake with VMMC in&#xD;
      sub-Saharan Africa.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Some men who gone through the PrePex procedure complained of foreskin odor while wearing the&#xD;
      PrePex 3-7 days after it is placed. This complaint was identified as potential risk for the&#xD;
      PrePex uptake. Researchers from Rwanda assumed there is a possible relation between the level&#xD;
      of foreskin odor to the patient foreskin hygiene technique. It was speculated that a patient&#xD;
      that follows an appropriate foreskin hygiene technique while wearing the device will have a&#xD;
      significantly lower foreskin odor on day 7 than a patient who does not follow such technique.&#xD;
      The Government of Rwanda decided to investigate those assumptions in a scientific way and&#xD;
      conduct a study to test different hygiene cleaning methods in order to increase the&#xD;
      acceptability of PrePex and mitigate the odor concern.&#xD;

      Voluntary Medical Male Circumcision (VMMC) is a one-time, low cost intervention that shown to&#xD;
      reduce men's risk of HIV infection by 53%-60% and by up to 73% in post-trial observation.&#xD;
      Numerous papers on the topic have been published over the past two decades to elevate HIV&#xD;
      prevention awareness, especially in sub-Saharan countries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The World Health Organization (WHO) and the Joint United Nations Program on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS)&#xD;
      have endorsed innovative approaches to VMMC uptake in settings where HIV prevalence and&#xD;
      incidence is high but male circumcision (MC) prevalence remains low in 14 target countries.&#xD;
      Recent modelling commissioned by President's Emergency Plan For AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) and&#xD;
      UNAIDS have agreed on an action plan to reach 80% coverage of VMMC in the 14 countries by&#xD;
      2015, this will entail performing roughly 20 million adult VMMC by 2015, averting&#xD;
      approximately 3.36 million new HIV infections and saving US$16.5 billion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The PrePex became the first medical device for adult male circumcision to receive WHO&#xD;
      prequalification as an alternative to the conventional surgical circumcision methods already&#xD;
      recognized by WHO. The PrePex VMMC procedure is bloodless and requires no injected&#xD;
      anesthesia, suturing, or sterile setting, it applies controlled radial elastic pressure to&#xD;
      the foreskin between a rigid Inner Ring and an Elastic Ring to cut off distal blood flow.&#xD;
      After 7 days, the necrotic foreskin and the device are removed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Government of Rwanda was the first country to implement the PrePex and acts as the&#xD;
      leading Center of Excellence providing trainings and formal guidelines. As part of the&#xD;
      Government's efforts to improve the PrePex implementation, it made efforts to improve the&#xD;
      psychology acceptability of the PrePex by men and thus to increase the uptake with VMMC in&#xD;
      sub-Saharan Africa.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PrePex researchers from Rwanda have assumed that there is a possible relation between the&#xD;
      level of odor from the foreskin to the foreskin hygiene technique. It was speculated that&#xD;
      when a patient follows an appropriate foreskin hygiene technique while wearing the device,&#xD;
      the odor before device removal (day 7) will be significantly lower than the odor of the&#xD;
      foreskin of a subject who follows a less effective foreskin hygiene technique.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Providing scientific evidence of the direct relation between odor and specific foreskin&#xD;
      hygiene technique, will allow VMMC implementing bodies to create a comprehensive and&#xD;
      effective PrePex related hygiene guidelines and reduce the potential of complaints from men&#xD;
      therefore, increasing the acceptability rate. A randomized, controlled, blinded study to&#xD;
      assess the effectiveness of 3 different foreskin hygiene techniques was conducted at Rwanda&#xD;
      Military Hospital Kigali, Rwanda during November 18th to December 4th, 2013.&#xD;
