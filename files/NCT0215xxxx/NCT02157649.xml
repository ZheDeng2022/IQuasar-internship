    <textblock>
      The objectives of this study are (a) to determine if drug levels from a single dose of an&#xD;
      extended-release Codeine/Guaifenesin tablet are similar to an immediate-release tablet given&#xD;
      every four hours containing lower doses considered safe for over-the-counter use; (b) to&#xD;
      evaluate if food affects the drug levels of this extended-release Codeine/Guaifenesin tablet&#xD;
      after a single administration; and (c) to assess the safety and tolerability of the&#xD;
      Codeine/Guaifenesin extended-release and immediate release tablet formulations.&#xD;
