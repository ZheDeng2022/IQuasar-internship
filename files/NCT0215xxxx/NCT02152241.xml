  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) are group of immune system disorders characterized by a&#xD;
      chronic course with remission and relapses. Canada is one of the countries with the highest&#xD;
      prevalence and incidence rates of IBD with 25% of patients present in children and&#xD;
      adolescents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As with any chronic illness, IBD diagnosed early in life has a significant impact on the&#xD;
      physical, emotional and social development of those affected. Consequently, it is logical to&#xD;
      speculate that patients with IBD may not do as well in education levels or employment status&#xD;
      attained compared to their peers without IBD. If this were the case, then interventions could&#xD;
      begin in childhood to better prepare patients with IBD for the challenges of living with a&#xD;
      chronic disease. Alternatively, if it is shown that they reach comparable social or&#xD;
      employment milestones as adults compared to unaffected peers then this would be enormously&#xD;
      reassuring to children and their parents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Properly designed studies to help in defining more appropriate interventions to these&#xD;
      patients are needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed study includes circulating a survey to evaluate the functioning level of adult&#xD;
      patients with IBD who were diagnosed during their childhood. The participants will be asked a&#xD;
      series of questions regarding their highest level of educational achievement, the nature of&#xD;
      their current employment, and their current marital status. The question format will parallel&#xD;
      that of the Canadian Community Health Survey from which data from an age matched healthy&#xD;
      adult Manitobans will be extracted and used as another control group. Responses will be&#xD;
      analysed for any possible differences between these groups.&#xD;

        The participant population will be comprised of adult patients who were initially diagnosed&#xD;
        with IBD in childhood or adolescence (diagnosis was made &lt; age of 18 years) and who were&#xD;
        followed by the Section of Pediatric Gastroenterology at the Winnipeg Children's Hospital&#xD;
        from 1974 - 2009.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Controls: age and sex-matched control group will be generated using the Canadian Community&#xD;
        Health Survey (CCHS) 2012 (16) with access through the local Research and Data Centre&#xD;
