  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the clinical and histologic outcomes for acellular&#xD;
      dermal matrix and resorbable membranes to determine if either provides a significant&#xD;
      therapeutic advantage.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The control subjects will receive a bone graft in the extraction socket, plus an additional&#xD;
      bone graft on the outside socket wall covered by a bioabsorbable membrane made of polylactic&#xD;
      acid and a citric acid ester. The test subjects will receive same type and technique of bone&#xD;
      graft with a the acellular dermal matrix membrane to cover the bone graft. The membrane the&#xD;
      patients receive will be randomly assigned using a coin toss: heads will be assigned to the&#xD;
      test group while tails will be assigned for controls. The objective is to determine if at 4&#xD;
      months the width and height of the jaw bone and also the soft tissue thickness where the&#xD;
      tooth was extracted has increased, decreased or remained the same. Also the amount of&#xD;
      patients own newly formed bone will be determined by microscopic examination of a core of jaw&#xD;
      bone that will be obtained from the site of implant placement immediately before the implant&#xD;
      is placed (the implant is not considered part of the study).&#xD;
