  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Magnesium is an essential mineral found in many foods; rich sources include whole grains,&#xD;
      green leafy vegetables, coffee, and legumes. Magnesium is a critical cofactor in &gt;300&#xD;
      enzymatic reactions, including those related to energy metabolism. Reduced magnesium intake&#xD;
      and serum concentrations have been detected, both cross-sectionally and prospectively,in type&#xD;
      2 diabetes and insulin resistance, hypertension, dyslipidemia, and cardiovascular diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Different studies have reported inadequate magnesium intake and low serum magnesium&#xD;
      concentrations may correlated also with metabolic syndrome, defined as a cluster of metabolic&#xD;
      disorders including obesity, hypertension, dyslipidemia and impaired glucose tolerance or&#xD;
      diabetes mellitus. Previous studies on this subject, however, reported contradicting results.&#xD;
      Some investigations reported inadequate magnesium intake and low serum magnesium&#xD;
      concentrations while others did not.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To our knowledge, the epidemiological evidence on the relation between dietary magnesium&#xD;
      intake and risk of metabolic syndrome has not yet been summarized.Therefore, the&#xD;
      investigators will perform a systematic review and dose-response meta-analysis to assess the&#xD;
      association between dietary and circulating magnesium level and risk of metabolic syndrome.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Background: Increasing evidence has suggested inadequate magnesium intake and low serum&#xD;
      magnesium concentrations may correlated with metabolic syndrome. However, whether or not&#xD;
      dietary or circulating magnesium at usual intakes or concentrations influences risk of&#xD;
      metabolic syndrome is inconsistent&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:To our knowledge, the epidemiological evidence on the relation between dietary&#xD;
      magnesium intake and risk of metabolic syndrome has not yet been summarized.Therefore, to&#xD;
      improve evidence-based guidance for dietary guidelines, the investigators will perform a&#xD;
      systematic review and dose-response meta-analysis to assess the association between dietary&#xD;
      and circulating magnesium level and risk of metabolic syndrome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: The planning, conduct and reporting of the proposed meta-analyses will follow&#xD;
      Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data search and screening: The PubMed, Cochrane CENTRAL, and EMBASE databases via Elsevier&#xD;
      will be searched using appropriate search terms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study selection: Published articles will be included: Randomized, controlled studies,&#xD;
      case-control studies, cross-sectional studies and cohort studies. All studies enrolled adults&#xD;
      (age 18 years) and reported metabolic syndrome as the outcome of interest and magnesium&#xD;
      intake or serum magnesium concentration as a risk factor or intervention. They reported&#xD;
      adjusted risk ratios, including odds ratios, relative risks, hazard ratios with 95%&#xD;
      confidence intervals (CIs), or they reported sufficient data to calculate these values for 3&#xD;
      or more quantitative categories of dietary magnesium intake levels. They reported risk ratios&#xD;
      with metabolic syndrome criteria according to the National Cholesterol Education Panel&#xD;
      (NCEP), modified NCEP, American Heart Association/National Heart Lung and Blood Institute ,&#xD;
      and harmonized definition . The investigators selected articles written in English that were&#xD;
      published in their entirety.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data extraction: Titles and/or abstracts of studies retrieved using the search strategy will&#xD;
      be screened independently by two review investigators to identify studies that potentially&#xD;
      meet the inclusion criteria outlined above. The full text of these potentially eligible&#xD;
      studies will be retrieved and independently assessed for eligibility by two investigators&#xD;
      with disagreements being resolved by consensus. Data will be extracted from&#xD;
      multivariate-adjusted models.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Extracted information will included: first author's surname, publication year, name of the&#xD;
      cohort study, study location (nation), years of follow-up (in case of cohort study design),&#xD;
      sex, age, sample size (prevalence of metabolic syndrome and total number of participants),&#xD;
      dietary magnesium intake(mg/day), serum magnesium concentration, covariates adjusted for in&#xD;
      the multivariable analysis, and risk ratios with their 95% confidence intervals for each&#xD;
      category of dietary magnesium intake and serum magnesium concentrations. The investigators&#xD;
      will extract risk ratios that reflect the greatest degree of adjustment for potential&#xD;
      confounders. The study investigator will assess the risk of bias in included studies using a&#xD;
      tool for assessing the risk of bias for nonrandomized studies (RoBANs) which contain the&#xD;
      following eight domains: comparability of groups, selection of participants, confounding&#xD;
      variables, measurement of exposure, blinding of outcome assessment, adequacy of outcome&#xD;
      assessment, incomplete outcome data and selective outcome reporting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Domains of RoBANs have the following characteristics:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Comparability of groups: Selection bias caused by the inadequate selection of comparable&#xD;
      groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Selection of participants: Selection bias caused by the inadequate selection of participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measurement of exposure: Performance bias caused by the inadequate confirmation and&#xD;
      consideration of confounding variable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blinding of outcome assessments: Detection bias caused by the inadequate blinding of outcome&#xD;
      assessments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Incomplete outcome data: Attrition bias caused by the inadequate handling of incomplete&#xD;
      outcome data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Selective outcome reporting: Reporting bias caused by the selective reporting of outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adequacy of outcome assessments: Performance bias caused by the inadequate confirmation of&#xD;
      outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RoBANS was developed to be used for the assessment of all study designs except for randomized&#xD;
      controlled studies. RoBANS includes criteria for judging the risk of bias for each domain.&#xD;
      Any discrepancies will be checked with the study investigator. A final copy of the form from&#xD;
      each trial will be checked with the appropriate trial investigator for verification.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcomes: The investigators will perform a two stage random-effects dose-risk meta-analysis&#xD;
      to examine a linear dose-response relationship between dose of magnesium intake and metabolic&#xD;
      syndrome using a generalized least-squares method taking into account random effects. This&#xD;
      method constructs a covariance estimate for dose-specific log relative risks (RRs) within&#xD;
      each study and then estimates the dose-response relation, accounting for between- and&#xD;
      within-study variation. Reported hazard ratios and odds ratios were assumed to approximate&#xD;
      RRs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the dose-response meta-analysis, The investigators will generalized least-squares&#xD;
      regression (GLST), which take into account the correlation between estimates for different&#xD;
      expose level, to compute study-specific slopes. This method requires that the number of cases&#xD;
      and controls (or person-years) and the RR with its variance estimate for at least three&#xD;
      quantitative exposure categories were known. For studies that dose not provide this&#xD;
      information, the investigators will estimate the dose-response slopes using variance-weighted&#xD;
      least-squares regression (VWLS). Both the methods (GLST and VWLS) required median or mean&#xD;
      intake for each category of intake level. For studies that report the concentrations as&#xD;
      ranges of magnesium intake only, the investigators will estimate the midpoint in each&#xD;
      category by calculating the average of the lower and upper bound. If the upper boundary for&#xD;
      the highest category is not provided, the investigators will assume that the boundary has the&#xD;
      same amplitude as the adjacent category. When the lowest category is open-ended, the&#xD;
      investigators will set the lower boundary to the same amplitude as the adjacent category. In&#xD;
      the case of different categorizations of magnesium intake and serum concentrations across&#xD;
      studies, the investigators will choose the lowest level as the reference category. Dose&#xD;
      responses of dietary magnesium intake will be standardized based on unweighted median&#xD;
      differences between the highest and lowest quartile category medians across all studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the meta-analysis, the statistical heterogeneity between the studies will be assessed&#xD;
      using the Q and I-squared statistics. For the Q statistic, heterogeneity was considered&#xD;
      present if p &lt; 0.1. The investigators will define low, moderate and high heterogeneity as&#xD;
      I-squared values of 25%, 50% and 75%, respectively. Publication bias will be evaluated using&#xD;
      Begg's test. In the presence of publication bias, the P values for Begg's test are less than&#xD;
      0.05. The investigators will conduct sensitivity analyses to evaluate potential sources of&#xD;
      heterogeneity in the analyses. The investigators will conduct subgroup meta-analyses&#xD;
      according to the study design (cross-sectional study, cohort cohort or nested case-control&#xD;
      study), study quality, definition of metabolic syndrome, gender, age, and geographic area of&#xD;
      the study&#xD;
