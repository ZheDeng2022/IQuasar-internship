    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effects of JNJ-54861911 on the QT/QTc intervals&#xD;
      in healthy participants, when administered at therapeutic (50 milligram [mg] once-daily) and&#xD;
      supratherapeutic (150 mg once-daily) doses for 7 days.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1, double blind (a medical research study in which neither the researchers&#xD;
      nor the participants know what treatment the participants is receiving), randomized (study&#xD;
      drug assigned by chance), placebo and positive-controlled, multiple-dose, 4-way crossover&#xD;
      (method used to switch participants from one study group to another) study. The study&#xD;
      consists of 3 parts: Screening period (Days -21 to -2), Double-blind treatment period and&#xD;
      End-of-study/early withdrawal assessment period (9 to 13 days after last dose). Treatment&#xD;
      period will comprise of 4 treatment regimens each consisting of a baseline assessment and a&#xD;
      treatment regime (Days -1 to 9). The participants will be randomly assigned to 1 of 4&#xD;
      treatment sequence groups (ADBC, BACD, CBDA, and DCAB) based on a computer-generated&#xD;
      randomization schedule and will receive the following 4 treatments in the order specified by&#xD;
      the randomization: Treatment A (JNJ-54861911, 50 milligram (mg) once daily for 7 days plus&#xD;
      moxifloxacin-matched placebo on Day 7); Treatment B (JNJ-54861911, 150 mg once daily for 7&#xD;
      days plus moxifloxacin-matched placebo on Day 7); Treatment C (JNJ-54861911-matched placebo&#xD;
      once daily for 7 days plus moxifloxacin-matched placebo on Day 7); Treatment D&#xD;
      (JNJ-54861911-matched placebo once daily for 7 days plus moxifloxacin 400 mg on Day 7). Each&#xD;
      treatment period will be separated by a washout period of at least 6 - 10 days. Total&#xD;
      duration of study for a participant will be 93 days. Change from Baseline in QT/QTc intervals&#xD;
      at Day 7 will be evaluated as primary end point. Participant's safety will be monitored&#xD;
      throughout the study.&#xD;
