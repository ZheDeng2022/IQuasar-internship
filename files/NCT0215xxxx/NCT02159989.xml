  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of sapanisertib and ziv-aflibercept&#xD;
      in treating patients with solid tumors that have come back (recurrent) and have spread to&#xD;
      another place in the body (metastatic) or cannot be removed by surgery (unresectable).&#xD;
      Sapanisertib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for&#xD;
      cell growth. Ziv-aflibercept may stop the growth of solid tumors by blocking the growth of&#xD;
      new blood vessels necessary for tumor growth. Giving sapanisertib with ziv-aflibercept may&#xD;
      kill more tumor cells.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate safety and tolerability, determine maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and recommend&#xD;
      a phase II dose of the combination of MLN0128 (TAK-228) (sapanisertib) with ziv-aflibercept&#xD;
      in patients with advanced cancers refractory to standard therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To give early indication of efficacy by evaluation of tumor size. II. To evaluate v-akt&#xD;
      murine thymoma viral oncogene homolog 1 (Akt)/mechanistic target of rapamycin&#xD;
      (serine/threonine kinase) (mTOR) signaling and adaptive responses; testing phosphorylation&#xD;
      levels of biomarkers such as, but not limited to, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)1&#xD;
      and 2, AKT and eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E-binding protein 1 (4E-BP1)&#xD;
      following treatment with MLN0128 (TAK-228) and ziv-aflibercept in peripheral blood&#xD;
      mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and biopsy samples during expansion cohort.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive sapanisertib orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 2-4, 9-11, 16-18, and 23-25&#xD;
      and ziv-aflibercept intravenously (IV) over 60 minutes on days 1 and 15. Cycles repeat every&#xD;
      28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 4 weeks.&#xD;
