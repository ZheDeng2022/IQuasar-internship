      This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of cellular immunotherapy following&#xD;
      chemotherapy in treating patients with non-Hodgkin lymphomas, chronic lymphocytic leukemia,&#xD;
      or B-cell prolymphocytic leukemia that has come back. Placing a modified gene into white&#xD;
      blood cells may help the body build an immune response to kill cancer cells.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To assess the safety of adoptive therapy using ex vivo expanded autologous memory T cells&#xD;
      (central memory T cells [Tcm] or naive and memory T-cells [Tn/mem]) that are enriched and&#xD;
      genetically modified to express a cluster of differentiation (CD)19-specific, hinged&#xD;
      optimized, CD28-costimulatory chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) as well as a truncated human&#xD;
      epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) (CD19R[EQ]28zeta/truncated EGFR [EGFRt]+ Tcm or&#xD;
      CD19R[EQ]28zeta/EGFRt+ Tn/mem) shortly following lymphodepletion for adults with&#xD;
      recurrent/progressive/residual CD19 + B-cell lymphoproliferative neoplasms (non-Hodgkin&#xD;
      lymphoma [NHL], chronic lymphocytic leukemia [CLL]/prolymphocytic leukemia [PLL]) and who are&#xD;
      not eligible for or decline City of Hope (COH) Institutional Review Board (IRB) Protocol&#xD;
      Number (No.) 13277.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To determine the recommended Phase II dose (RP2D) in the two Tn/mem strata (NHL;&#xD;
      CLL/PLL).&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To study antitumor activity of CD19R(EQ)CD28zeta/EGFRt+Tcm or CD19R[EQ]28zeta/EGFRt+&#xD;
      Tn/mem (e.g., detection of CAR+ T cells, B cells, and tumor burden).&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of autologous CD19CAR-CD28-CD3zeta-EGFRt-expressing&#xD;
      enriched T cells (T-cell infusion). Participants are assigned to 1 of 2 groups based on&#xD;
      disease status.&#xD;
&#xD;
      GROUP I (NON-HODGKIN LYMPHOMA [NHL]):&#xD;
&#xD;
      LYMPHODEPLETING REGIMEN: Patients receive a chemotherapy regimen based on disease type and&#xD;
      extent of disease comprising of cyclophosphamide, bendamustine hydrochloride, fludarabine&#xD;
      phosphate, etoposide.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CELLULAR IMMUNOTHERAPY: Beginning 3-10 days later after lymphodepletion, patients receive&#xD;
      autologous CD19CAR-CD28-CD3zeta-EGFRt-expressing Tn/mem-enriched T-lymphocytes IV over 10-15&#xD;
      minutes on day 0. Patients with relapsed, residual or progressive disease may receive an&#xD;
      optional second infusion of autologous CD19CAR-CD28-CD3zeta-EGFRt-expressing Tn/mem-enriched&#xD;
      T-lymphocytes &gt;= 28 days post T cell infusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      GROUP II (CHRONIC LYMPHOCYTIC LEUKEMIA [CLL] AND/OR PROLYMPHOCYTIC LEUKEMIA [PLL]):&#xD;
&#xD;
      LYMPHODEPLETING REGIMEN: Patients receive a chemotherapy regimen based on disease type and&#xD;
      extent of disease comprising of cyclophosphamide, bendamustine hydrochloride, fludarabine&#xD;
      phosphate, etoposide.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CELLULAR IMMUNOTHERAPY: Beginning 3-10 days later after lymphodepletion, patients receive&#xD;
      autologous CD19CAR-CD28-CD3zeta-EGFRt-expressing Tn/mem-enriched T-lymphocytes IV over 10-15&#xD;
      minutes on day 0. Patients with relapsed, residual or progressive disease may receive an&#xD;
      optional second infusion of autologous CD19CAR-CD28-CD3zeta-EGFRt-expressing Tn/mem-enriched&#xD;
      T-lymphocytes &gt;= 28 days post T cell infusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at every 2 days for 14 days,&#xD;
      weekly for 1 month, monthly for 1 year, and then yearly for at least 15 years.&#xD;
