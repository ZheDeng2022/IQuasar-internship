      Purpose&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To validate 2 -day loop recording ( R.Test Evolution 4 ) to 2 -day Holter recording&#xD;
           (gold standard) for the detection of atrial fibrillation of ≥ 30 seconds duration in a&#xD;
           consecutive population of patients with stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To determine whether short run of atrial fibrillation (&lt; 30s ) or the presence of many&#xD;
           supraventricular extrasystoles detected on Holter recording, is associated with risk of&#xD;
           re-stroke in a consecutive population of patients with stroke or TIA .&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To test whether a 7-day Loop Recording (R -test) detects more patients with atrial&#xD;
           fibrillation than 2 days of Holter recording in a consecutive population of patients&#xD;
           with stroke or TIA.&#xD;

      Project title:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Detection of atrial fibrillation in patients with recent stroke or TIA: Validity of automated&#xD;
      loop-recording (Rtest) compared to Holter recording and predictive value of short runs of&#xD;
      atrial fibrillation and an excess supraventricular extra systoles for a new stroke&#xD;
&#xD;
      Abstract:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stroke constitutes a major health problem both nationally and globally. Each year 15 million&#xD;
      people worldwide are attacked by stroke. In Denmark stroke hits 14.000 people a year and is&#xD;
      the third leading cause of death. In this research project, we will examine the heart rate of&#xD;
      more than 1,500 patients whom within 1 week has had a blood clot in the brain (ischemic&#xD;
      stroke) or have had symptoms of a blood clot in the brain, which has dwindled within 24 hours&#xD;
      (TIA). There are no clear international or national guidelines regarding the optimal way to&#xD;
      detect atrial fibrillation in stroke and TIA patients, though atrial fibrillation is known to&#xD;
      increase fivefold the risk of stroke. Holter recording with two days electrocardiogram is&#xD;
      considered as the golden standard for investigation of heart rhythm disturbances and is&#xD;
      offered at Department of Neurology in Holstebro, where we recruit patients. Holter recording&#xD;
      is a resource-intensive procedure in data analysis. Project patients will be mounted with a&#xD;
      2- day Holter and Rtest for either 2 or 7 days. The Rtest is a loop recorder and a new device&#xD;
      on the market that continuously monitor and opposite a Holter recorder, automatically&#xD;
      analyses heart rhythm. The validity of the Rtest with regard to detect atrial fibrillation&#xD;
      compared to Holter is unknown and is what we which to clarify. Additionally we use the 2-day&#xD;
      Holter recordings to test whether short-term rhythm disorders as atrial fibrillation &lt;30&#xD;
      seconds, and/or many extra heartbeats (supraventricular extra systoles) increases the risk of&#xD;
      stroke recurrence. Patients will be followed in the Danish Stroke Register. If an increased&#xD;
      risk is found, these gray area patients who are currently not offered anticoagulant therapy,&#xD;
      may prove to have treatment indication. If the study shows that loop recording can replace&#xD;
      Holter recording it will mean an economic gain. The study is expected to contribute&#xD;
      substantial evidence for the future treatment of stroke and TIA patients.Stroke constitutes a&#xD;
