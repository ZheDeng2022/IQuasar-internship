  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Buruli ulcer is a neglected tropical disease caused by infection with Mycobacterium ulcerans&#xD;
      (Mu) in rural parts of West Africa. It causes large skin ulcers mainly in children aged 5 to&#xD;
      15 years. Access to treatment is limited and many cases present late. There have been major&#xD;
      advances in understanding the mechanism of disease together with improved diagnosis and&#xD;
      management. The aim of the proposed studies is to identify markers predictive of a rapid&#xD;
      response to antibiotic treatment and to investigate the pathogenesis of paradoxical reactions&#xD;
      and oedematous lesions in Mu disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Infection with Mu results in a nodule under the skin which enlarges and breaks down to form&#xD;
      an ulcer. This is because Mu produces a toxin that spreads outwards and damages subcutaneous&#xD;
      tissue. In recent years it has been found that antibiotic treatment for 8 weeks with daily&#xD;
      tablets and intramuscular injections heals ulcers. This is unpleasant and it would be better&#xD;
      if the treatment could be shortened. Our previous studies suggest this may be possible.&#xD;
      Therefore a wide range of tests will be investigated in order to identify markers for people&#xD;
      in whom the infection is at an early stage with low numbers of Mu bacteria and low levels of&#xD;
      toxin in the skin. During antibiotic treatment the rate of healing will be measured to find&#xD;
      out which markers are the most reliable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In some patients new areas of inflammation develop despite treatment and this is called a&#xD;
      paradoxical reaction. The immune response to Mu will be investigated serially during&#xD;
      antibiotic treatment to investigate the cause of paradoxical reactions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      About 15% of patients have oedematous disease, the most severe form of Buruli ulcer. We will&#xD;
      study the amount of Mu toxin produced by the strain of Mu cultured from patients with this&#xD;
      form of the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Buruli ulcer patients that heal rapidly/slowly or develop paradoxical reactions with&#xD;
           treatment will have associated predictive viability or serum biomarkers.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Buruli ulcer patients with oedematous disease are associated with larger amounts of&#xD;
           mycolactone and viable organisms&#xD;

      Procedures&#xD;
&#xD;
      Infected Participants&#xD;
&#xD;
      After collection of demographic data using standard World Health Organisation forms (BU01)&#xD;
      together with a careful history to establish when early lesions (nodules, plaques and ulcers)&#xD;
      were first observed, the type and dimensions of lesions will be documented together with&#xD;
      digital photographs and tracings onto acetate sheets. For oedematous lesions only digital&#xD;
      photographs will be obtained. Patients will be reviewed at 2 weekly intervals during standard&#xD;
      antibiotic treatment (rifampicin 10mg/kg and streptomycin 15mg/kg) with further recordings of&#xD;
      clinical data as is done for all routine patients. These measurements will enable calculation&#xD;
      of rate of healing and healing time in relation to lesion size and type. Patients will be&#xD;
      monitored for paradoxical reactions that occur after the start of treatment in about 8% of&#xD;
      patients. These procedures are routinely provided as part of routine care of Buruli ulcer&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Samples&#xD;
&#xD;
      The additional samples required from patients for the study are an extra volume of blood&#xD;
      (7ml) and 3 swabs taken on occasions (at baseline, week 4, 8, 12 and 16) only when the&#xD;
      patient has a lesion at these time points. Swabs/fine needle aspirates are required to&#xD;
      determine if organisms detected by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) are still viable, one for&#xD;
      M. ulcerans culture, one for measurement of mycolactone concentration, and one for combined&#xD;
      16S ribosomal ribonucleic acid (rRNA) reverse transcriptase / insertion sequence IS2404&#xD;
      Real-Time qPCR assay (1).&#xD;
&#xD;
      For patients that develop paradoxical lesions during therapy an additional blood sample and 3&#xD;
      swabs/fine needle aspirates will be obtained at the time of the reaction for viability&#xD;
      markers (M. ulcerans culture, combined 16S rRNA reverse transcriptase / IS2404 Real-Time&#xD;
      quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) assay and mycolactone detection).&#xD;
&#xD;
      For oedematous lesions, one swab/fine needle aspirates will be obtained for mycolactone&#xD;
      detection and quantification from lesions that are ulcerated. A 3 mm punch biopsy will be&#xD;
      performed under local anaesthetic on non-ulcerated lesions for the same purpose only when the&#xD;
      patient is 15 years old or above.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Established practice for routine diagnosis of M. ulcerans infection is to take fine needle&#xD;
      aspirates from non-ulcerated lesions for acid-fast bacillus (AFB) detection, culture and PCR&#xD;
      for IS2404. This specimen is not large enough for mycolactone quantification, an important&#xD;
      part of the investigation into the pathogenesis of oedematous disease which often presents&#xD;
      without ulceration. Swabs are used in the diagnosis of ulcers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Controls For the household contacts of patients in endemic villages and healthy controls in&#xD;
      non-endemic villages a 7ml blood sample will be obtained to investigate protein biomarkers by&#xD;
      Luminex assay, T cell subsets by flow cytometry and immune responses using Enzyme Linked&#xD;
      Immunosorbent Assay(ELISA) in a whole blood assay for comparative studies. No tissue biopsies&#xD;
      will be taken.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Definition of paradoxical reaction Paradoxical reaction will be defined as an increase in&#xD;
      inflammatory changes with increase in lesion size of greater than 100%, after initial&#xD;
      improvement and decrease in size; and/or the appearance of new lesions following or during&#xD;
      antimycobacterial treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigations Detection of rapid responders: Biomarkers, tissue mycolactone concentration&#xD;
      and immune response will be measured at baseline. The rate of healing will be estimated by&#xD;
      documenting the initial size of the lesion and the time to complete healing as previously&#xD;
      (2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Detection of Mu: Swabs homogenates will be inoculated onto Lowenstein Jensen slopes for&#xD;
      culture and microscopy will be carried out on Ziehl-Neelsen stained smears for AFB. PCR for&#xD;
      IS2404 will be carried out as described previously (3).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Biomarkers:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Serum samples will be subjected to multi-analyte profiling using Luminex multianalyte&#xD;
      profiling to identify markers of oedematous disease, paradoxical reactions and rapid&#xD;
      responders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will also use mass spectrometry-based proteomics to generate additional serum/tissue&#xD;
      biomarkers taking a three-stage approach. First we will use sample fractionation and mass&#xD;
      spectrometry (matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionisation/time of flight/mass spectrometry)&#xD;
      to determine the degree of variability of proteomic composition in samples from subjects to&#xD;
      be treated with antibiotics. This first screening will allow the identification and removal&#xD;
      of subjects showing a partial response and subsequent analysis of those showing the most&#xD;
      disparate responses. Stage 2 comprises a deep liquid chromatography mass spectrometry&#xD;
      (LC/MS/MS)-based quantitative analysis of pooled samples (3 pools generated randomly from&#xD;
      each response cohort) from each of the identified response groups. Molecules that show&#xD;
      significant changes will be considered as candidate biomarkers of drug response. In Stage 3&#xD;
      immunoassays (ELISA) will be developed in order to test the validity of each novel biomarker&#xD;
      in its ability separately or in combination with existing biomarkers to predict drug&#xD;
      response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Immune response: Whole blood samples will be incubated with Mu antigens overnight at 37&#xD;
      degrees celsius and the supernate will be stored for cytokine assays using ELISA as in our&#xD;
      previous studies (4).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Antigen stimulated T cell populations will also be studied by flow cytometry to assess the&#xD;
      proportion of Interferon(IFN) gamma, Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and interleukin-2 (IL2)&#xD;
      secreting T cells in patients compared to controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mycolactone detection: Lipids will be extracted from homogenised skin biopsies and&#xD;
      swabs//fine needle aspirates and the biological activity of mycolactone will be measured by a&#xD;
      cytotoxicity assay as described previously using human embryonic lung fibroblasts as target&#xD;
      cells. The presence of mycolactone in tissue samples will be confirmed and quantified by mass&#xD;
      spectrometry as previously described (5). Mycolactone production by the strain of Mu isolated&#xD;
      from oedematous lesions will be quantified in vitro and the tissue concentration of&#xD;
      mycolactone in oedematous lesions will be measured.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size and justification There will be 450 participants in this study. Our previous&#xD;
      studies showed a mean difference in TNF alpha at baseline between fast and slow responders to&#xD;
      be 15pg/ml and a standard deviation of 33pg/ml. The standardized mean difference computed as&#xD;
      d=15/33 was 0.45. The sample size required to detect this difference with a two-sided&#xD;
      significance of 5% and with 80% power would be 100 participants in each group (that 200&#xD;
      patients). We expect an attrition rate of 20% bringing the sample size to 250 patients. There&#xD;
      will be control group of 200 healthy volunteers&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis For the purpose of this study a &quot;rapid responder or fast responder&quot; is&#xD;
      defined as a patient with a time to healing of less than 12 weeks or rate of healing of&#xD;
      greater than 4mm/week and &quot; slow responder or slow healer&quot; is defined as a patient with time&#xD;
      to healing of 12 or more weeks or rate of healing of less than 3 mm/week&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data generated by multianalyte profiling will be analyzed by multivariate analysis, including&#xD;
      principal component analysis (PCA) and partial least-squares (PLS)-related methods, using the&#xD;
      SIMCA 13 software (Umetrics, Sweden) . Univariate analyses will be performed to further&#xD;
      characterize candidate biomarkers. Here, differences between controls and disease patients&#xD;
      will be analyzed using the non-parametric Wilcoxon rank sum (Mann-Whitney) test. Paired&#xD;
      samples for BUD patients at week 0 and week 12 will be compared using the Wilcoxon signed&#xD;
      rank test. Univariate analysis and multiple testing adjustments will be performed using R&#xD;
      software (version 2.13.2, R Development Core Team, R Foundation for Statistical Computing,&#xD;
      Vienna, Austria) and package QVALUE. GraphPad Prism software will be used for graphical&#xD;
      representation.&#xD;
