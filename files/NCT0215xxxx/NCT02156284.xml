  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective was to compare the frequency and intensity of symptoms of fear in patients of&#xD;
      preoperative cardiac surgery who received empathic behaviour from nurse or those who received&#xD;
      no specific type of empathic behaviour. This is a randomized clinical trial. The sample&#xD;
      consisted of 44 patients in preoperative of cardiac surgery, who were divided in two groups:&#xD;
      empathic behaviour by nurses and without specific empathic behaviour. Fear was assessed at&#xD;
      two time points: before and after the intervention. The instrument used was developed and&#xD;
      validated, comprising 15 defining characteristics of the nursing diagnosis fear. The&#xD;
      hypothesis is that the group who received empathic behaviour from nurse will reduce the&#xD;
      anxiety.&#xD;

      Primary outcome is fear. Fear was assessed by a nurse using of an instrument developed and&#xD;
      validated previous, based on 15 defining characteristics described by North American Nursing&#xD;
      Diagnosis Association for the nursing diagnosis fear: apprehension, increased tension,&#xD;
      exciting, nervousness, verbalization of fear (expressed concern), increased pulse, nausea,&#xD;
      vomiting, fatigue, abnormal respiratory rate, increased perspiration, dry mouth, fear of&#xD;
      death (reported), crying and impaired bowel motility.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients were evaluated for the presence and absence of these fear symptoms through scores: 0&#xD;
      (no symptom) and 1 (presence of symptom). For analysis of the results was carried out the sum&#xD;
      of the scores of each symptom, ranging from 0 to 15, with the higher the score, the greater&#xD;
      was the fear symptoms presented by the patient.&#xD;
