      The purpose of this study is to determine if supplementation with a mixture of omega 7 and 3&#xD;
      fats has a favorable influence on blood inflammation and lipoprotein biomarkers in women with&#xD;
      systemic inflammation compared to omega 3 and placebo.&#xD;

      Background Information and Scientific Rationale&#xD;
&#xD;
      Consumption of long-chain n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 PUFAs), including&#xD;
      eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA; 20:5n-3), docosapentaenoic acid (DPA; 22:5n-3), and&#xD;
      docosahexaenoic acid (DHA; 22:6n-3) from fish and fish-oil supplements reduces disease risk&#xD;
      factors, counters components of the metabolic syndrome including inflammation and high&#xD;
      triglycerides, stabilizes heart cells, prevents blood clots from forming, and decreases&#xD;
      all-cause mortality, cardiac and sudden death, and possibly stroke (Circulation&#xD;
      2006;114:82-96).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The health benefits of n3-PUFAs have prompted the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to&#xD;
      support a qualified health claim status for EPA and DHA. Estimates are that the ratio of&#xD;
      omega-6 (n-6) linoleic acid (LA) to omega-3 (n-3) Î±-linolenic acid (ALA; 18:3n-3), ALA&#xD;
      increased from 6.4 to 10.0 during the 20th century, resulting in decreased tissue&#xD;
      concentrations of EPA and DHA (Am J Clin Nutr 2011;93:950-962). Recommendations for EPA and&#xD;
      DHA intake vary, but in general, most organizations recommend a range of 300 to 1,000 mg/day&#xD;
      from fatty fish and supplements (Circulation 2006;114:82-96). The FDA recommends that&#xD;
      consumers not exceed 3,000 mg/day of EPA and DHA, with no more than 2,000 mg/day from a&#xD;
      dietary supplement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The persistent increase in inflammation biomarkers is defined as chronic or systemic&#xD;
      inflammation, and is linked with multiple disorders and diseases including atherosclerosis&#xD;
      and cardiovascular disease (CVD), the metabolic syndrome (MetS), and diabetes mellitus&#xD;
      (Circulation 2003;107:499-511). C-reactive protein (CRP) is the most frequently measured&#xD;
      inflammatory biomarker, and individuals with CRP values in the upper tertile of the adult&#xD;
      population (&gt;3.0 mg/L) have a 2-fold increase in CVD risk compared to those with a CRP&#xD;
      concentration below 1.0 mg/L (Curr Atheroscler Rep 2010;12:110-8). An elevated fasting IL-6&#xD;
      concentration is a significant component of the chronic low-grade inflammation (Metabolism&#xD;
      2007;56:332-8). Epidemiological studies suggest an inverse relationship between CRP and a&#xD;
      diet rich in marine products (Am J Clin Nutr 2006;84:223-9). At sufficiently high intakes,&#xD;
      n-3 PUFAs may decrease the production of inflammatory eicosanoids and cytokines (Mol Nutr&#xD;
      Food Res 2008;52:885-97). The majority of intervention studies in adults with features of&#xD;
      MetS report a benefit for some inflammatory measures, but other studies using high n-3 fatty&#xD;
      acid doses and long supplementation periods have reported no effect (for review, see Lipids&#xD;
      2013;48:319-32). A pre-existing inflammatory state or a poor n-3 PUFA status may be required&#xD;
      to see a benefit of n-3 PUFAs on systemic inflammation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Palmitoleic acid (C16:1 n-7) is an omega-7 monounsaturated fatty acid that is found in&#xD;
      macadamia nuts and the seeds of a variety of plants including cat's claw, sea buckthorn, and&#xD;
      milk weed (Prog Lipid Res 2012;51:340-9). Macadamia nuts are the only practical source for&#xD;
      palmitoleic acid (30%). The nutritional and biological functions of palmitoleic acid are&#xD;
      complex and scientific understanding of the biological significance on human health is&#xD;
      limited (J Lipid Res 2011;52:808-12; Curr Opin Clin Nutr Metab Care. 2013;16:225-31).&#xD;
      Palmitoleate may increase cell membrane fluidity, attenuate insulin resistance, and reduce&#xD;
      inflammation associated with diabetes and heart disease (for review, see Prog Lipid Res&#xD;
      2012;51:340-9). Several human studies indicate that supplementation and/or inclusion of&#xD;
      macadamia nuts in a cholesterol-lowering diet significantly reduces LDL-C concentrations&#xD;
      (4.0-10.7%) and triglyceride concentrations (9.0-20.9%) (see J Nutr 2008;138:761-7; Arch&#xD;
      Intern Med 2000;160:1154-8). One human study with 17 male hypercholesterolemia subjects&#xD;
      showed that supplementation with macadamia nuts for a period of 4 weeks reduced plasma&#xD;
      biomarkers for inflammation and oxidative stress (Lipids 2007;42:583-7).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Product (A) Placebo Placebo (EEs)- MCT (medium chain triglyceride) and manufactured by&#xD;
      Natural Factors. All subjects will receive one softgel orally twice daily with food.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Product (B): Omega-3 fatty acid ethyl esters, 2 soft gels of total 1000mg (660mg EPA&#xD;
      +340mg DHA)/day EPA/DHA product manufactured by Natural Factors. Each softgel of Omega-3&#xD;
      contains 500 mg of a natural marine lipid concentrate (330 mg eicosapentaenoic acid [EPA],&#xD;
      170 mg docosahexaenoic acid [DHA]). All subjects will receive one softgel orally twice daily&#xD;
      with food.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Product (C): Omega-3 fatty acid + Omega-7 fatty acid Cis-Palmitoleic acid, ethyl&#xD;
      esters, 2 soft gels of total 1000mg (660mg EPA +340mg DHA) of Omega-3 + 210mg of Omega-7&#xD;
      fatty acid /day&#xD;
&#xD;
      All subjects will receive one soft gel orally twice daily with food.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Potential Risks and Benefits&#xD;
&#xD;
      Potential Risks of the products All of these fatty acids are found naturally in whole foods&#xD;
      such as macadamia nuts, fish, or meat. The omega 3 supplements in this study do not exceed&#xD;
      the upper levels recommended by the FDA (3,000 mg/day of EPA and DHA, with no more than 2,000&#xD;
      mg/day from a dietary supplement). For comparison, one 3-oz serving of wild Atlantic salmon&#xD;
      provides about 1,500 mg of EPA and DHA, and a 3-oz serving of canned white tuna provides 700&#xD;
      mg. Fish oil supplementation has an established history of safe use as a nutritional&#xD;
      supplement and as a medical food.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Palmitoleic acid is a monounsaturated fat that is in macadamia nuts. The purified omega 7 fat&#xD;
      to be used in this study is derived from Peruvian anchovies, and concentrated through a&#xD;
      seven-step purification process to 50% palmitoleic acid. In an unpublished randomized, double&#xD;
      blinded, placebo controlled study, the omega 7 + 3 combination exerted anti-inflammatory and&#xD;
      lipid modulating effects, and was well tolerated among participants with no adverse effects&#xD;
      (Dr. Andrew Swick, Metagenics, private communication, February 13, 2014).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Potential Benefits Potential health benefits include improvements in plasma lipoproteins and&#xD;
      reductions in systemic inflammation with omega 7 + 3 combination and omega 3 fats.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Objectives/Endpoints This is a single center, placebo controlled, double blinded, 8&#xD;
      week, 3-arm randomized controlled trial conducted at the Appalachian State University Human&#xD;
      Performance Laboratory at the North Carolina Research Campus in Kannapolis, NC. All patients&#xD;
      will undergo informed consent process before enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an exploratory study with generally healthy female subjects to obtain information&#xD;
      pertaining to efficacy of omega 7 + 3 combination in improving systemic inflammation and&#xD;
      plasma lipoproteins compared to omega 3 fats alone and placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary Study Objectives/Endpoints are:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To explore the effects of 8-weeks supplementation with omegas 7 and 3 fats combination versus&#xD;
      omega-3 fats and placebo on systemic inflammation (CRP and cytokine panel).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Study Objectives/Endpoints are:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To explore the effects of 8-weeks supplementation with omegas 7 and 3 fats combination versus&#xD;
      omega-3 fats and placebo on plasma lipoproteins.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design Screening/Orientation: This is a double-blinded, placebo-controlled randomized&#xD;
      clinical study to assess the effects of placebo (A) and Omega-3 (B) and Omega-7 and Omega-3&#xD;
      combination (C) in the subjects. Approximately 68 female subjects between the ages of 18 and&#xD;
      70 years and with a BMI of 25 and higher who meet study entrance criteria will be entered&#xD;
      into the study and randomized to one of three groups (A,B, or C). The goal is for 60 women to&#xD;
      finish all phases of the study. The purpose of the screening/orientation visit is to&#xD;
      determine volunteer eligibility for study participation. Screening will include review and&#xD;
      signing of the consent form; measurement of height, weight, and body composition; completion&#xD;
      of the medical history questionnaire and review of medical history and current medications;&#xD;
      completion of the symptom log; and collection of 8 hour fasting blood samples for testing of&#xD;
      CRP. Based on previous experience, approximately 100 women will have to be screened to&#xD;
      identify 60-68 subjects with a CRP of 2 mg/L and higher. Women with a CRP below 2 mg/L will&#xD;
      receive an email message indicating that they do not meet study criteria, but will receive&#xD;
      results from the CRP test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical Visits:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Total length of participation in the study, including screening, will be approximately 10&#xD;
      weeks. Subjects will meet with the study manager at all lab visits. During the lab visits,&#xD;
      the study manager will review questionnaires for signs and symptoms of adverse events, review&#xD;
      compliance to the study product and lifestyle, and answer any questions from the subject.&#xD;
      Blood samples will be collected, and body weight and composition measured at all visits. Body&#xD;
      composition will be assessed through leg-to-leg bioelectrical impedance using a Tanita scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Supplement schedule: All subjects will ingest 1 soft gel (either A, B, or C) twice daily with&#xD;
      morning and evening meals for 8 weeks. If a subject fails to ingest supplements at a given&#xD;
      meal or day, they will be asked to double up intake to get back on schedule. Subjects failing&#xD;
      to take supplements for three days in a row or longer will be asked to contact the research&#xD;
      manager to review whether or not they should continue in the study. Subjects will maintain&#xD;
      their current lifestyles - including diet, and exercise without change during trial&#xD;
      participation. Subjects will be instructed not to make changes to their use of prescribed&#xD;
      medications. Acetaminophen may be used as rescue for headaches and associated symptoms during&#xD;
      study participation. The research manager will make sure the subjects are maintaining use of&#xD;
      group A, B, or C study soft gel supplements by email between the visits. Subjects must agree&#xD;
      to maintain normal dietary and physical activity patterns during the study, make no formal&#xD;
      attempts to lose body weight, limit fish and seafood to no more than one serving per week,&#xD;
      and limit intake of omega-6 fatty acids by lowering use of corn, soybean, safflower,&#xD;
      sunflower, and similar oils, and substituting moderate amounts of olive and canola oil.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 1 (Day 0) is defined as the day of enrollment and administration of the first study&#xD;
      product. Subjects meeting all criteria including CRP levels of 2 mg/L and higher will return&#xD;
      to the ASU-NCRC Human Performance Laboratory and receive a 28-day supply of capsules (A,B, or&#xD;
      C). The consent form and medical questionnaire will be reviewed. A 28-day retrospective&#xD;
      symptom log will be filled in. Weight and body composition will be assessed on the Tanita BIA&#xD;
      scale. A blood sample will be collected, with serum sent to the Carolina Medical Center for&#xD;
      CRP and lipid panel analysis. Plasma aliquots (EDTA tubes) will be prepared and frozen at&#xD;
      -80Â°C for post-study NMR lipoprotein analysis at LipoScience (Raleigh, NC), cytokine analysis&#xD;
      (7-plex MSD panel) at the North Carolina Research Campus, and fatty acid analysis at the&#xD;
      Lipid Labs LLC (Austin, Minnesota).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 2 (Week 4) and Visit 3 (Week 8):&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study procedures from Visit 1 will be repeated. Compliance will be assessed through the&#xD;
      return of unused capsules.&#xD;
