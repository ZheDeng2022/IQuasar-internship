  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Getting cold (not maintaining normothermia) around surgery (perioperative period) leads to&#xD;
      many negative outcomes for patients including increased wound complications, abnormal heart&#xD;
      rhythms and increased blood loss. These all lead to increased length of hospital stay and&#xD;
      higher requirements for post operative monitoring. These add to around $3500 of extra costs&#xD;
      per patient. The investigators aim to study the effects of a warming device, placed around&#xD;
      the patient's legs and/or feet, to determine it's safety, efficacy and eventually compare to&#xD;
      the current gold standard of a forced air warming blanket. Forced air warming has been&#xD;
      associated with the spread of germs over the surgical field. Hence the need for warming&#xD;
      equipment that won't do that.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cases of inadvertent perioperative hypothermia (IPH) within a hospital setting are often&#xD;
      overlooked and should be where the incidence of hypothermia can be eliminated. Heat loss&#xD;
      occurs predominantly via convective heat transfer, particularly through glabrous surfaces&#xD;
      such as the palms and soles. A decrease in core body temperature can be categorized into mild&#xD;
      (32 deg C-36 deg C), moderate (28 deg C-32 deg C), or severe (&lt;28 deg C) hypothermia (2).&#xD;
      During preoperative care, patients are dressed solely in a gown and are often exposed to cold&#xD;
      waiting areas with little insulation. They are exposed to cold liquids during the wash of the&#xD;
      surgical site during sterilization preparation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once in the operating room (OR), the patients are naked and exposed to a room temperature&#xD;
      well below 36 deg C. To compensate for hypothermia, the hypothalamus attempts to stimulate&#xD;
      heat production through sympathetically mediated vasoconstriction, shivering and increased&#xD;
      adrenal activity, and through the erection of hair follicles to trap air and retain heat. At&#xD;
      the onset of surgery, delivered anesthetics immediately impair the normal autonomic&#xD;
      thermoregulatory controls. Colder blood is transferred from the peripheries of the body to&#xD;
      the core through a phenomenon known as redistributive hypothermia. Vasodilatation and&#xD;
      reduction in muscle tone creates a significant drop in core temperature within the first&#xD;
      half-hour of surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IPH is not a rare occurrence. Several sources, including the NICE guidelines, estimate that&#xD;
      as many as 70% of patients undergoing normal surgery may be admitted to the Post Anesthesia&#xD;
      Care Unit (PACU) hypothermic if the risk is not managed. More conservative estimates put the&#xD;
      incidence at 20%. An estimated 48 million inpatient surgical visits were made in the US in&#xD;
      2009, translating to between 10 to 34 million cases of IPH per year in the US alone. All&#xD;
      patients are at risk of developing IPH, although certain factors increase the risk of IPH.&#xD;
      American Society for Anesthesiology (ASA) grade, lower preoperative temperatures, combined&#xD;
      regional and general anesthesia, and intermediate or major surgery are all associated with&#xD;
      increased risk of IPH. Under these risk factors, over 17 million patients are at high-risk&#xD;
      for becoming hypothermic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical Impact The development of IPH is strongly correlated with a multitude of&#xD;
      physiological organ system changes, impacting the cardiovascular, respiratory, neurologic,&#xD;
      immunologic, hematologic, drug metabolic, and wound healing mechanisms. The incidence of&#xD;
      several post-surgical complications is increased due to even mild hypothermia (Table 1).&#xD;
      Intraoperatively, hypothermia can cause a decrease in cardiac output and heart rate, which&#xD;
      can lead to ventricular dysrhythmias. Platelet functions become impaired and there is a&#xD;
      decrease in coagulation factors, which lead to greater intraoperative bleeding and blood&#xD;
      loss. Hypothermia is associated with a four-fold increase in surgical would infection and&#xD;
      twice as many morbid cardiac events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Overall, compared to non-hypothermic patients, those who suffer IPH experience greater rates&#xD;
      of surgical site infections, bleeding, cardiac complications which may require additional&#xD;
      monitoring, PACU length of stay, total length of stay, and subjective discomfort.&#xD;
      Interestingly, the likelihood of developing hypothermia in an open versus laparoscopic&#xD;
      surgery is similar across various types of procedures, most likely attributable to the fact&#xD;
      that most laparoscopic procedures are significantly longer when compared to their open&#xD;
      surgery counterpart.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prevention of the effects of redistribution hypothermia is best done before their peripheries&#xD;
      become cold, which often occurs before they arrive in the OR. Our audit of Stanford&#xD;
      Hospital's Ambulatory Care Centre OR times, from January to March 2013, showed this time was&#xD;
      at least 2 hours for all elective patients. Placing responsibility of the device placement on&#xD;
      preoperative staff rather than OR staff is also better for compliance, as OR staff are&#xD;
      burdened with many other priorities prior to the incision and are more rushed for time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The critical period to intervene and prevent perioperative hypothermia is in the preoperative&#xD;
      phase. This is when peripheral warming can be in place so that when redistribution occurs due&#xD;
      to general anesthesia, warm blood flows back from the core rather than cold blood if no&#xD;
      peripheral warming is in place. Without preoperative warming, patients will become&#xD;
      hypothermic at the beginning of surgery. Intraoperative warming minimizes the extent but does&#xD;
      not prevent it.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In one study, 2 cohorts were compared to show the effect on core temperature of preoperative&#xD;
      warming to those with no preoperative warming. Both cohorts received intraoperative forced&#xD;
      air warming. Without preoperative warming in this cohort, forced air warming methods take 2-5&#xD;
      hours to return the patient to normothermia. Patients cannot leave the PACU hypothermic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Using a crude works-like prototype the investigators conducted bench testing and collection&#xD;
      of preliminary data. In the first hour, no heating was applied followed by two hours with the&#xD;
      device turned on. During this time temperature was recorded (oral, arm and leg surface),&#xD;
      thermal and general comfort was measured using a visual analogue scale and the presence of&#xD;
      shivering or sweating was noted. The device was set up to maintain a maximum at skin&#xD;
      temperature of 43Â°C. This was shown previously to be the higher limit and optimal&#xD;
      preoperative warming temperature. This was shown previously to be the higher limit and&#xD;
      optimal preoperative warming temperature. The experiment showed that core temperature was&#xD;
      maintained in three of the four subjects with one patient becoming hypothermic in the pre&#xD;
      device on period. Arm temperature was constant and hypothermic during the experiment. Leg&#xD;
      temperature increased with the device on. Thermal comfort and general comfort levels showed&#xD;
      the prototype was well tolerated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hope to learn from the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prototype development What are the best configurations to apply the device to the patient?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety Will the device maintain a consistent temperature at the skin? Will there be no burns&#xD;
      occuring? Will the patient not get hyperthermic?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Efficacy Will the device keep the patient from getting cold? If so, what are the relative&#xD;
      effects of warming at the soles of the feet and / or with waring at the popliteal fossa? If&#xD;
      efficacy is established, is it better than / equivalent to the gold standard of the forced&#xD;
      air warming blanket?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Usability Does the device fit into the operative workflow What are the opinions of the users&#xD;
      (patients, nurses, doctors) about the usability of the device? Will the device causes patient&#xD;
      discomfort while they are awake? Does it improve their thermal comfort?&#xD;
