      Breast cancer affects a large proportion of Danish women and late morbidity following breast&#xD;
      cancer treatment including pain, reduced motility and force of the arm and shoulder,&#xD;
      disturbed sensitivity, and lymph edema affects many patients. The risk for such late&#xD;
      complications have previously been carefully described by us and others in patients operated&#xD;
      by traditional methods, but the follow-up in most of these studies have been rather short ,&#xD;
      and long time follow-up results are not available. The impact of the new oncoplastic&#xD;
      techniques that allows more women to have breast conserving surgery is not known yet. These&#xD;
      operations are more extensive and therefore might be accompanied by more complications. The&#xD;
      purpose of this study is to give answer to that question.The study includes three parts.&#xD;
      First a questionnaire to patients who have breast conserving surgery performed in one of the&#xD;
      three breast units in Central Region Denmark. It contains questions regarding arm morbidity,&#xD;
      quality of life, comorbidity, and body image. The questionnaire should be filled in&#xD;
      preoperatively and 18 months after surgery. The second part consists of an objective&#xD;
      evaluation of shoulder and arm function and cosmesis before and after breast conserving&#xD;
      surgery with and without oncoplastic techniques. This should be performed at baseline before&#xD;
      surgery and 18 months later. The third part is a long time follow-up of patients after breast&#xD;
      conserving surgery without oncoplastic techniques. This group of patients is recruited from&#xD;
      three breast units in Central Region Denmark. It contains questions regarding arm morbidity,&#xD;
      quality of life, comorbidity, and body image. The questionnaire should be filled in&#xD;
      preoperatively and 18 months after surgery. The second part consists of an objective&#xD;
      evaluation of shoulder and arm function and cosmesis before and after breast conserving&#xD;
      surgery with and without oncoplastic techniques. This should be performed at baseline before&#xD;
      surgery and 18 months later. The third part is a long time follow-up of patients after breast&#xD;
      conserving surgery without oncoplastic techniques. This group of patients is recruited from&#xD;
      the cohort in a previous study with 18 months follow-up following breast conserving surgery&#xD;
      without oncoplastic technique.&#xD;

      Aims and perspectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the last 20 years there has been increasing focus on the morbidity following breast&#xD;
      cancer treatment. This has lead to new and less mutilating surgical techniques to replace the&#xD;
      traditional operations: Breast conserving surgery (BCS) instead of mastectomy and sentinel&#xD;
      lymph node dissection (SLND) instead of axillary lymph node dissection (ALND). Lately,&#xD;
      oncoplastic techniques have been introduced. These techniques further increase the ability to&#xD;
      preserve the breast in breast cancer and are expected to increase the cosmetic results&#xD;
      compared with traditional techniques, but they are somewhat larger procedures and might&#xD;
      therefore lead to increased morbidity after treatment. Hitherto this has not been evaluated&#xD;
      in clinical research trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the present study is to examine if oncoplastic techniques in relation to breast&#xD;
      cancer treatment have an independent influence on morbidity and quality of life compared to&#xD;
      traditional BCS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, a group of breast cancer patients treated with BCS 10 years ago and who&#xD;
      underwent a similar study back then, will be invited to a reevaluation of shoulder function&#xD;
      and morbidity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Previously, mastectomy was the most applied surgical procedure related to breast cancer.&#xD;
      Until the beginning of 1990's it was, by DBCG (Danish Breast Cancer Cooperative Group),&#xD;
      recommended as a standard treatment. During the transition towards a more gentle surgical&#xD;
      procedure, the use of oncoplastic techniques has been incorporated1,2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The definition of oncoplastic breast surgery is defined by DBCG as: &quot;a breast conserving&#xD;
      procedure, including techniques of plastic surgery, where traditional breast conserving&#xD;
      surgery would have lead to a cosmetic unsatisfactory result, and mastectomy would have been&#xD;
      the alternative. The requirement for classifying a procedure as oncoplastic is 'the transfer&#xD;
      of tissue that requires further skin incision than the breast conserving surgery in its&#xD;
      own'3.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The oncoplastic techniques in breast cancer surgery are divided into 3 groups: volume&#xD;
      displacement, volume reduction and volume replacement3-5. The oncological results of&#xD;
      oncoplastic breast surgery has been evaluated in other studies and found comparable to the&#xD;
      oncological results of traditional BCS and mastectomy6.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Increasing evidence have shown that among breast cancer patients a substantial fraction&#xD;
      suffer from late symptoms including impairment of shoulder function, pain, disturbance in&#xD;
      sensibility, and lymph edema7-9. The sequels are attributable to treatment related factors,&#xD;
      including the breast surgical procedure10, axillary dissection11, and radiation therapy12.&#xD;
      Studies indicate that sentinel lymph node biopsy (SNLB) reduces shoulder morbidity as&#xD;
      compared to ALND11,13, but shoulder impairment also occur after this procedure14.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently, the occurrence of late symptoms has been addressed in two Danish publications based&#xD;
      on questionnaires7,8 with 2-3 years8 and more than 5 years7 observation, respectively. These&#xD;
      studies showed that chronic pain 2-3 years after surgery is a problem in up to 47% of&#xD;
      patients of whom 13% suffered from severe and 39% from moderate pain8. More than five years&#xD;
      after treatment, chronic pain was recorded in 29% of patients7, and this was associated with&#xD;
      poorer quality of life and a higher medicine consumption. Furthermore, a large part of long&#xD;
      time survivors reported arm swelling (25%), phantom symptoms (19%), paresthesia (47%), and&#xD;
      allodynia (15%)7.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The reported frequency of Lymph oedema following breast cancer treatment vary considerably,&#xD;
      probably depending on different definitions and different methods for measurement. As stated&#xD;
      earlier, many patients report a subjective feeling of swelling, though the proportion of&#xD;
      affected patients seems lower in studies, where objective measures are applied. In a study on&#xD;
      node negative patients comparing the results of sentinel node biopsy (SNB) with axillary&#xD;
      dissection (ALND)11 up to 18 months after surgery, arm swelling was reported in 7% and 44%,&#xD;
      respectively, emphasizing the advantage of the more limited procedure. Using the water&#xD;
      displacement method the difference in arm volume between these groups was very modest,&#xD;
      although statistically significant. At 18 months, the arm volume on the operated side was 10&#xD;
      ml less than on the non-affected arm in the SNB group, compared with an increase of 28 ml in&#xD;
      the ALND group. The water displacement method has been simplified and validated since15,16.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Shoulder morbidity median three years after surgery including ALND was measured in a study on&#xD;
      132 patients (mastectomy 67%, BCT 33%)10. The shoulder function was assessed by the Constant&#xD;
      Shoulder Score (CSS), combining subjective symptoms with objective measures of range of&#xD;
      motion (ROM) and strengths. Thirty-five percent of the patients had reductions in ROM, in&#xD;
      most cases it was flexion and abduction that were most affected. Among these patients CSS was&#xD;
      reduced by 12% on the treated side compared with the non-treated shoulder. Patients with&#xD;
      normal ROM had comparable CSS on the two sides. In comparison with BCS and radiotherapy,&#xD;
      mastectomy combined with postoperative radiation, more often lead to reduced ROM (OR 8.5). In&#xD;
      the study by Husted Madsen et al.11 on more recently operated node negative patients, ALND&#xD;
      turned out to be significantly associated with a poorer outcome when the dependent variable&#xD;
      was the absence or presence of subjective arm and shoulder complaints.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Most studies concerning morbidity, especially those with objective evaluation of patients,&#xD;
      have a short follow-up period typically only a few years. No such studies with long-term&#xD;
      follow-up up to 5-10 years are available.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A few studies have aimed at describing the effect of physiotherapy on shoulder-arm&#xD;
      morbidity13,17, and they have confirmed a better outcome after physiotherapy including&#xD;
      general advice and recommendations about how to use and protect the affected arm and&#xD;
      instructions for exercises. In the randomized study by Lauridsen et al.13, team instructed&#xD;
      physiotherapy consisting of 12 sessions of 60 minutes twice a week instituted between the 6th&#xD;
      and 8th postoperative week was compared to the same treatment postponed until the 26th&#xD;
      postoperative week. The team instructed physiotherapy commenced early immediately improved&#xD;
      the shoulder function, but the same treatment could improve shoulder function significantly&#xD;
      even when instituted as long as six months postoperatively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a recently published randomized study, Veiga et al.18 have found indications of a better&#xD;
      quality of life and self-esteem in BCS including oncoplastic surgery than in patients&#xD;
      undergoing traditional BCS. On the other hand, in a study including 101 patients it was found&#xD;
      that breast symmetry after BCS had had no effect on quality of life19. In that study symmetry&#xD;
      was evaluated by a breast analyzing tool (BAT), one of more available objective measures.&#xD;
      Most often, symmetry has been evaluated subjectively by a panel of experts, which has been&#xD;
      considered the gold standard. Lately, Cardoso et al. have introduced another objective method&#xD;
      where the cosmetic outcome is evaluated semi-automatically from systematic clinical fotos20.&#xD;
      They reported a 70% agreement between the expert panel and their measurements. The cosmetic&#xD;
      outcome after BCS has been evaluated by Lyngholm et al.21 using the &quot;breast retraction&#xD;
      assessment&quot; (BAT) which estimates the symmetry based on measurements on clinical photos22.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The relation between the oncoplastic surgical techniques and shoulder disability, chronic&#xD;
      pain, and lymph edema has hitherto not been systematically investigated, but some attempts&#xD;
      have been made to describe the impact on shoulder function of post-mastectomy reconstructive&#xD;
      surgery. In a study from Sweden23, shoulder function after reconstructive procedures&#xD;
      involving the latissimus dorsi flap was examined. The main finding was that the&#xD;
      reconstruction lead to an insignificant increase in long-term shoulder morbidity, but it was&#xD;
      also noted that a small subset of patients developed long-term impairment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design and methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study includes three parts:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. A questionnaire describing the occurrence of loco-regional morbidity in patients who has&#xD;
           undergone breast conserving surgery with and without oncoplastic techniques.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Objective evaluation of shoulder and arm function and cosmesis before and after breast&#xD;
           conserving surgery with and without oncoplastic techniques.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Long time follow-up of patients after breast conserving surgery without oncoplastic&#xD;
           techniques.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 1&#xD;
&#xD;
      The questionnaire combines previous used and validated forms addressing shoulder and arm&#xD;
      function, pain, sensibility, cosmesis and body image, and QoL. The questionnaire should be&#xD;
      filled in preoperatively and 18 months after surgery. Patients included in the longtime&#xD;
      follow-up study described below are asked to answer the same questionnaire, which includes&#xD;
      questions about the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Arm morbidity: Pain, sensibility, swelling, restriction of movements, force&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Quality of life (EORTC QLQ-C30 and QLQ-BR23)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Comorbidity - Charlsons Comorbidity Index&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Body Image&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Physiotherapy Part 2&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cohort study with 18 months follow-up. Patients are evaluated at baseline before surgery and&#xD;
      after 18 months with the following methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Passive Range of movement (pROM). The passive motion of both shoulders are measured in&#xD;
           supine position by use of a goniometer: flexion, extension, abduction, inner and outer&#xD;
           rotation&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Constant Shoulder Score (CSS). Including active Range of movement (aROM) in flexion,&#xD;
           abduction, rotation and strengths during shoulder abduction in upright standing position&#xD;
           with the IsoForceControl dynamometer&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Sensibility recording&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Arm circumference&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Arm volume - simplified water displacement method&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cosmetic outcome - using clinical photos of the breast region (frontal- and side view)&#xD;
           and estimation of BRA (Breast Retraction Assessment) Re. part 1 and 2&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients, who are undergoing breast conserving surgery for invasive breast cancer or&#xD;
      carcinoma in situ by one of the three breast surgical units at hospitals in Central Denmark&#xD;
      Region (Viborg, Randers, and Aarhus). They will be divided in the two groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  BCS including oncoplastic surgical techniques&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  BCS without oncoplastic surgical techniques&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients who are unable to sign an informed consent form&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients above the age of 75 years and under the age of 18 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients who have previously been operated in the same or the contralateral breast,&#xD;
           shoulder or arm Part 3 The study performed by Husted Madsen et al. in 2003-4 included in&#xD;
           all 395 patients. Surviving patients from this cohort are asked to e new evaluation of&#xD;
           shoulder and arm function following the same procedure as described in Part 1 and 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistics:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on previous experience and statistical calculations estimated that the investigators&#xD;
      need 495 to participate in the questionnaire (Part 1) and 220 patient for the objective&#xD;
      evaluation (Part 2) Further details can be added If requested.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethics:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients included in part 1 and 2 will be contacted in the breast units after confirmation of&#xD;
      the diagnosis and after decision about the treatment has been made. Before inclusion oral and&#xD;
      written information about the study are given and the patient is asked to sign an informed&#xD;
      consent form. For part 3 of these studies, patients receive a letter invitation and these&#xD;
      patients are also asked to sign an informed consent form before entering the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is only minor discomfort associated with the objective evaluation and no major&#xD;
      complications or side effects are expected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The protocol is submitted to The Local Research Ethics Committee for Central Region Denmark&#xD;
      for approval.&#xD;
