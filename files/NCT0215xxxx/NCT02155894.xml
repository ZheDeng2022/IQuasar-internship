  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study aims to investigate the effect a systematic telemedicine intervention, based on the&#xD;
      tigth control principals, as a platform for disease monitoring among patients with rheumatoid&#xD;
      arthritis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is hypothesized that:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A systematic telemedicine intervention targeted to tight control of disease activity&#xD;
           among patients with RA will be equally effective as usual care (outpatient consultation&#xD;
           by a rheumatologist).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  There will be no difference in the effect whether this telemedicine consultation is&#xD;
           carried out by a rheumatologist or a rheumatology nurse.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patient satisfaction and the patient's general perception of involvement in their&#xD;
           treatment will be increased for patients who receive the telemedicine intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  All the effects will apply both in the short term (&lt; 6 months) and in the long term (&gt; 1&#xD;
           year).&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic disease affecting 0.5-1.0 % of the Danish population.&#xD;
      Due to an expected growing population and a higher proportion of elderly the prevalence is&#xD;
      likely to increase in the years to come.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Untreated RA will lead to joint destruction disabling the patients, but in recent years both&#xD;
      treatment and treatment strategies have been markedly improved. According to international&#xD;
      guidelines early start of medical treatment, quick escalation of doses, and adjustment of the&#xD;
      dose throughout the whole disease course when there are signs of disease activity, are&#xD;
      considered important elements in the RA treatment strategy. Consequently, the success of this&#xD;
      strategy implies the possibility of regular routine testing of all RA patients, which could&#xD;
      become a challenge to the health care system causing substandard treatment to RA patients in&#xD;
      the future. This calls for reorganization of the routine care of RA, i.e. in form of a&#xD;
      telemedicine intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Telemedicine is considered to be the use of communication and information technologies to&#xD;
      deliver clinical care where the individuals involved are not at the same location. No studies&#xD;
      have yet investigated the effect of monitoring disease activity through a standardized&#xD;
      telemedicine treatment strategy in patients with RA, and most of the evidence is derived from&#xD;
      studies within chronic heart disease, chronic obstructive lung disease, asthma, diabetes and&#xD;
      hypertension. This evidence indicates, however, that telemedicine interventions seem to be&#xD;
      effective, time saving and associated with a high degree of patient satisfaction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RA disease activity is measured using a composite score that includes both objective and&#xD;
      subjective outcome parameters to measure present as well as past disease activity. These&#xD;
      scores include: tender and swollen joint count together with the patient's global assessment,&#xD;
      report of physical functioning, the measurement of an acute-phase reactant and serial&#xD;
      radiographic assessment. The most commonly used instruments for measuring RA disease activity&#xD;
      in daily clinical practice is the European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) criteria, the&#xD;
      Disease Activity Score 28 (DAS28).&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, in a telemedicine intervention there is no direct physical contact between the&#xD;
      patient and the health professionals, making traditional disease activity measures unfit for&#xD;
      use, as they imply an assessment of tender and swollen joints carried out by a health&#xD;
      professional. It has been suggested to let the patients examine their joints. Still, it has&#xD;
      been shown that patients tend to overestimate the presence of swollen joints which impairs&#xD;
      the identification of synovitis - and thereby disease activity and flare. Hence, telemedicine&#xD;
      disease activity monitoring in RA may be best supported by validated measures based on other&#xD;
      kinds of patient self-assessment, i.e. the newly developed &quot;Flare&quot; instrument.&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to international recommendations from the European League Against Rheumatism&#xD;
      (EULAR) patients should have access to nurse-led telephone services to enhance continuity of&#xD;
      care and to provide ongoing support, but it still remains unclarified which of the&#xD;
      occupational groups, doctors or nurses, is to carry out the routine telemedicine disease&#xD;
      monitoring.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The trend in RA treatment is towards patients taking a more active role in the treatment, and&#xD;
      telemedicine could be a very workable solution. However, before decision is made of&#xD;
      transforming tight control of disease activity among patients with RA into a telemedicine&#xD;
      intervention the effectiveness of such intervention, both when executed by doctors and&#xD;
      nurses, need to be investigated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objectives of this study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To test the effectiveness of a customized telemedicine intervention targeted to tight&#xD;
           control of disease activity among patients with RA, compared with usual outpatient care&#xD;
           in a pragmatic randomized controlled trail.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To test if the effect differs depending on whether the telemedicine consultation is&#xD;
           carried out by a rheumatologist or by a rheumatology nurse.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To examine the patients perspective towards telemedicine tight control of disease&#xD;
           activity in RA, and assess patient satisfaction and acceptability towards the&#xD;
           intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Power calculation&#xD;
&#xD;
      A decrease in DAS28 on 1.2 is regarded as a significant clinically improvement. A change in&#xD;
      DAS28 on 0.6 is regarded as non-response . Thus, a change in the DAS28 score &gt;0.6 will be&#xD;
      used as the cut-point for a change in the condition. The standard deviation in DAS28 is&#xD;
      presumed to be 1.5. Hence, in order to detect a 1-sided statistically significant change&#xD;
      between the three groups, with a statistical power on 80% (beta=0.20), a sample size of at&#xD;
      least 98 patients in each group is required.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention&#xD;
&#xD;
      A systematic review of the literature has been conducted in order to make sure that the&#xD;
      telemedicine management is informed by evidence. Further, focus group interviews have been&#xD;
      conducted both among patient groups and among health professionals, to ensure that the&#xD;
      intervention is based on expert consensus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The software used in the telemedicine intervention will be based on the established generic&#xD;
      Patient Reported Outcome (PRO) system, WestChronic, which was developed in 2004 for&#xD;
      collection of PRO data for research purposes in clinical epidemiological studies. WestChronic&#xD;
      supports dynamic dual mode data collection with web or paper forms as well as communication&#xD;
      to the patient with personalized postal letters, e-mails, and text messages. All information&#xD;
      regarding implementations, items and questionnaires, communication, users, and patients&#xD;
      resides in tables in a Structured Query Language (SQL) database, and all administration of&#xD;
      implementations, questionnaires, users, and patients is supported by the server software and&#xD;
      carried out in browser-windows. The software interphase serves a dual purpose: a) to be a&#xD;
      customized communication tool between the patients and the health professionals, and b) to&#xD;
      serve as decision support for the health professionals through the incorporation of a&#xD;
      validated disease self-assessment tool.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Decision support, the Flare instrument&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Flare instrument (FI) serves as decision support for assessing disease activity in RA&#xD;
      during the telemedicine intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      FI is a 12-item questionnaire where patients are asked to express their degree of agreement&#xD;
      about different statements concerning disease activity on a 10-point likert scale. Six items&#xD;
      concerns joint symptoms (tenderness, stiffness and pain) and six items is concerning general&#xD;
      symptoms. When scoring FI it is possible to compute a FI total score (all 12 items) or a&#xD;
      subscale for joint or general symptoms, respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The instrument is translated into Danish according to the International Quality of Life&#xD;
      Asessment (IQULA) method. It is validated in a cross sectional study among 100 consecutive&#xD;
      patients from the outpatient clinic at Department of Rheumatology, Aarhus University&#xD;
      Hospital, using DAS28 as the gold standard (unpublished data).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Execution&#xD;
&#xD;
      After randomization patients will be allocated to one of the three treatment arms:&#xD;
      Telemedicine, doctor (TD), Telemedicine, Nurse (TN) or control in week 0, 13, 26, 39 and 52.&#xD;
      The telemedicine consultation will be based on a telephone consultation. The consultation&#xD;
      will follow a predefined consultation checklist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients allocated to TD or TN, who has expressed a desire to complete questionnaires in&#xD;
      webform, will receive a letter a week before the consultation to remind them that they must&#xD;
      assess their disease activity through the software interphase, within the next couple of&#xD;
      days. Patients, who have expressed a wish to fill in questionnaires in paper form, will&#xD;
      receive the questionnaire a week before the consultation and asked to return it to&#xD;
      WestChronic immediately after completion. A chasing procedure will be carried out in case of&#xD;
      non-respondence. Two reminders will be send to the patients over a period of four weeks and&#xD;
      continuous non-respondence will hereafter lead to exclusion from the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During telephone consultation, updated clinical test results will be available through the&#xD;
      electronic medical system. Acute consultations will be performed and registered in all three&#xD;
      groups as needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistics&#xD;
&#xD;
      Comparisons between groups will be made with the Fisher exact test for dichotomous responses&#xD;
      and the Mann-Whitney U test for non-dichotomous responses. Changes over time will be analyzed&#xD;
      with McNemar's test for dichotomous responses and Wilcoxon signed rank sum test for&#xD;
      non-dichotomous responses. Data will be reported as a mean (SD) for variables in which normal&#xD;
      distribution is found; otherwise data will be reported as the median ((interquartile range&#xD;
      (IQR)).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will be analyzed using both &quot;intention to treat&quot; and per protocol. In case of missing&#xD;
      data multiple imputations will be used.&#xD;
