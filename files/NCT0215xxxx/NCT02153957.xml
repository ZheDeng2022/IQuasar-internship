  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - More children with cancer are surviving into adulthood. Some side effects from treatment go&#xD;
      away quickly. But some problems may not go away or may only show up months or years later.&#xD;
      These problems are called late effects. Late effects can cause difficulties in cognitive&#xD;
      functions, such as attention and memory. Physical activity has been found to improve the&#xD;
      attention and memory skills of children with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD).&#xD;
      Researchers want to see if physical activity can help with these cognitive problems in&#xD;
      children with brain tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To see if physical activity can improve cognitive functions in children who had radiation&#xD;
      therapy for a brain tumor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Children ages 8 17 who had radiation for a brain tumor at least 2 years ago. They must have&#xD;
      access to a computer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be screened with height, weight, and medical history. They will answer&#xD;
           questions about daily physical activities. Their heart will be checked.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will go to the clinic for 2 days. They will have a fitness exam and tests&#xD;
           about attention, memory, and concentration. They will have blood taken and answer&#xD;
           questions. Parents will also answer questions.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be put into 2 groups. For the first 12 weeks, the intervention group&#xD;
           will follow a physical activity program. The control group will do their usual physical&#xD;
           activities.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  For the second 12 weeks, the control group will follow the physical activity program.&#xD;
           The intervention group will continue the activities on their own. All groups will track&#xD;
           their physical activity with an activity monitor and computer.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will have a follow-up visit at the clinic after each session. They will&#xD;
           repeat some of the tests listed above.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The study lasts 24 weeks plus the two follow-up visits. Participants can keep their&#xD;
           activity monitor.&#xD;

      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Children treated with cranial radiation therapy (CRT) for brain tumors are at high risk&#xD;
           for developing neurocognitive late effects consisting of significant declines in overall&#xD;
           IQ and specific cognitive impairments, particularly in attention, memory, and processing&#xD;
           speed. Academic functioning, daily activities, and quality of life (QOL) also are&#xD;
           impacted, and children often require special educational services.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Despite adaptations in radiation therapy (delay of radiation, reduced dose, specialized&#xD;
           techniques), cognitive deficits still develop. Interventions targeting cognitive&#xD;
           rehabilitation are limited yet sorely needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A potential and novel intervention for cognitive rehabilitation that has not been&#xD;
           explored in children with cancer involves physical activity (PA). Compelling evidence&#xD;
           from both human and animal studies indicates that PA affects the same brain mechanisms&#xD;
           and cognitive functions damaged by CRT and chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Previous PA intervention studies in children with cancer have been found to be feasible,&#xD;
           safe, and beneficial to health but have not examined cognition outcomes. Therefore, we&#xD;
           will conduct a randomized controlled trial to evaluate the effects of PA on the&#xD;
           cognitive functioning of children treated with CRT for brain tumors. In addition, we&#xD;
           will enhance the intervention by combining it with Acceptance and Commitment Therapy&#xD;
           (ACT) techniques to maximize participants' motivation to engage in PA.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The immediate intervention group (the intervention group ) will engage in the enhanced&#xD;
           PA intervention program for the first 12 weeks followed by 12 weeks of PA maintenance on&#xD;
           their own, while the delayed intervention control group (the control group ) will engage&#xD;
           in their usual physical activity for the first 12 weeks followed by the enhanced PA&#xD;
           intervention program for the second 12 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      -To assess the effects of a 12-week enhanced physical activity (PA) home intervention on&#xD;
      visual memory (CogState One Card Learning Accuracy score) in children treated with CRT for&#xD;
      brain tumors compared to a control group engaged in usual physical activity during the first&#xD;
      12 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ELIGIBILITY:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Children ages 8 - 18 years previously diagnosed with a brain tumor in childhood who are&#xD;
           at least 1 year post-completion of CRT and who are not on an active anti-tumor treatment&#xD;
           will be eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Children should have reported or documented cognitive difficulties in attention,&#xD;
           learning and memory, or processing speed per the child s parent or legal guardian.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN:&#xD;
&#xD;
      -In this prospective randomized controlled trial. Children will be randomized to one of two&#xD;
      groups: Group 1 (n=30): The immediate intervention group (the intervention group ) will&#xD;
      participate in the enhanced PA home intervention group for the first 12 weeks; followed by 12&#xD;
      weeks of PA maintenance on their own.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 2 (n=30): The delayed intervention control group (the control group ) will engage in&#xD;
      their usual physical activity (no intervention) for 12 weeks; followed by the enhanced PA&#xD;
      home intervention for 12 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Neurobehavioral, circulating growth factors, and cardiorespiratory evaluations will be&#xD;
           conducted at baseline (T0) and after the first 12 weeks at home (T2) in both the&#xD;
           intervention and control groups. The acute effects of the in-lab PA will be assessed&#xD;
           immediately following the baseline treadmill fitness test (T1) using selected cognitive&#xD;
           measures in both groups. PA for both groups will be measured throughout the period at&#xD;
           home via activity monitors.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  After the completion of the first 12 week period at home and the follow-up evaluations&#xD;
           (T2), the intervention group will be asked to maintain their PA levels on their own for&#xD;
           the next 12 weeks while the control group will participate in the enhanced PA&#xD;
           intervention at home for 12 weeks. A final cognitive evaluation will be conducted in&#xD;
           both groups after the completion of the second 12- week period (T3). The primary outcome&#xD;
           measure is the Cogstate One Card Learning Accuracy Score. The effects of PA on other&#xD;
           neurobehavioral outcomes and circulating growth factors also will be examined.&#xD;
