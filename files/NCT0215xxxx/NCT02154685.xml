  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Smoking occurs in approximately 21% of the US population, is responsible for an annual&#xD;
      mortality rate of approximately 438,000 citizens, and has an associated healthcare economic&#xD;
      burden of $167 billion. Although pharmacotherapies have improved cessation outcome, the vast&#xD;
      majority of individuals making quit attempts relapse within 5-10 days of cessation. The&#xD;
      hypotheses to be examined in this study may have potentially important implications for&#xD;
      smoking cessation treatment and will, therefore, target the single greatest addiction-related&#xD;
      cause of morbidity and mortality.This study will investigate a novel behavioral strategy for&#xD;
      altering important memory processes that underlie human smoking-related nicotine addiction.&#xD;
      This strategy used in this study employs established cue exposure procedures to putatively&#xD;
      update smoking-related memory with information that will suppress responding to smoking cues.&#xD;
      The goal here is to alter existing nicotine-related memory directly rather than rely&#xD;
      exclusively on the establishment of an inhibitory extinction process, via traditional cue&#xD;
      exposure therapy, which is known to be vulnerable to spontaneous recovery, renewal and&#xD;
      reinstatement. Positive findings would represent a significant advance in exposure-based&#xD;
      therapy for addiction and could lead to a treatment that uniquely targets the problem of&#xD;
      cue-elicited craving and reactivity, thereby addressing a major obstacle to successful&#xD;
      smoking cessation.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      We propose to examine the effects of two sessions of retrieval-extinction (R-E) training in&#xD;
      smokers who are making a quit attempt. Retrieval will be initiated by a brief (5-min.) video&#xD;
      with smoking-related content and the extinction will consist of protracted (1 hr.) exposure&#xD;
      to smoking cues. A control group receiving the same treatment except that the retrieval video&#xD;
      will have nonsmoking/neutral content will serve to demonstrate that retrieval is a key&#xD;
      feature of R-E training. Effects of training on smoking craving and cue reactivity will be&#xD;
      assessed 1-day, 2-weeks and 4-weeks post-training, whereas training effects on indices of&#xD;
      smoking behavior/cessation will be preliminarily assessed 2-weeks and 4-weeks post-training.&#xD;
      It is expected that the R-E training will result in significant and enduring reductions in&#xD;
      craving and reactivity to both novel and familiar smoking cues and have a favorable impact on&#xD;
      smoking. Positive findings from this study could lead to a safe and effective behavioral&#xD;
      intervention that will help smokers overcome the threat to cessation posed by cue-elicited&#xD;
      craving and reactivity, and thereby reduce the burden levied against society by this most&#xD;
      costly addiction. Additionally, this intervention could be modified to treat addiction to&#xD;
      other substances.&#xD;

             level sufficient to allow accurate completion of all assessment instruments.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants must meet DSM-IV criteria for current nicotine dependence and be a daily&#xD;
             cigarette smoker of 10+ cigarettes/day for a minimum duration of three years.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants must live within a 50-mile radius of the research facility and have&#xD;
             reliable transportation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants must be willing to make a quit attempt beginning the night before the&#xD;
             three consecutive daily laboratory sessions (i.e., two retrieval-extinction training&#xD;
             sessions and the test session performed 24-hours after the second retrieval-extinction&#xD;
             training session).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants must be willing to (a) be overnight smoking abstinent (CO verified) prior&#xD;
             to the baseline smoking cue reactivity assessment, and (b) make a cessation attempt&#xD;
             and be smoking abstinent (CO verified) over the three day period that corresponds to&#xD;
             the two retrieval-extinction training sessions and the test session performed 24-hours&#xD;
             after the second retrieval-extinction training session.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants must be willing to submit to a breathalyzer (alcohol) assessment and&#xD;
             urine drug screen (for benzodiazepines, methamphetamine, cocaine, marijuana and&#xD;
             opiates) and produce a negative test result on (a) the day of the baseline smoking cue&#xD;
             reactivity assessment, and (b) each of the three consecutive days that correspond to&#xD;
             the two retrieval-extinction training sessions and the test session performed 24-hours&#xD;
             after the second retrieval-extinction training session.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants must consent to random assignment to the R-E vs. NR-E conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants must not use smokeless tobacco.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants must be willing to forego any other medication or behavioral treatment&#xD;
             for smoking cessation during their enrollment in this study (with the exception of a&#xD;
             referral, upon request, to the SC Quitline). Treatment referral will be provided at&#xD;
             the end of the study.&#xD;
