  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Some patients have respiratory depression (decreased breaths per minute) after surgery.&#xD;
      Acetaminophen, an FDA approved pain medication, may prevent this problem. The purpose of this&#xD;
      study is to determine if acetaminophen decreases respiratory depression after surgery. The&#xD;
      investigators will also evaluate the cost effectiveness of acetaminophen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients having elective major abdominal surgery are being asked to participate in this&#xD;
      research study. If eligible, a patient will have their baseline tidal volume (amount of air&#xD;
      moved into or out of the lungs) and vital capacity (how much air the lungs are capable of&#xD;
      holding) measured using a spirometer (apparatus for measuring the volume of air inspired and&#xD;
      expired by the lungs) measured before surgery. Three questionnaires will also need to be&#xD;
      completed before surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patient will then be randomized, like flipping a coin, to receive either Acetaminophen or&#xD;
      placebo (inactive substance) as an infusion throughout surgery and for the first two days&#xD;
      thereafter. Neither the patient nor his or her physician will know if the patient is assigned&#xD;
      to study drug or placebo. Regardless of study assignment, both groups will receive standard&#xD;
      pain management medications and sedation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After surgery, the patient's blood pressure, activity, posture, respiratory rate, the&#xD;
      electrical activity of the heart, oxygen saturation, tidal volume, minute ventilation and&#xD;
      respiratory rate will be continuously monitored and recorded for 48 hours using a wireless&#xD;
      pulse-oximeter and a respiratory volume monitor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      48 hours after surgery the patient will be asked to complete a patient satisfaction&#xD;
      questionnaire, which will allow the patient to rate the satisfaction with the treatment&#xD;
      received for pain. The patient will also be asked to complete a questionnaire about recovery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At discharge, the patient will be given two questionnaires about pain and quality of life.&#xD;

    <measure>Duration of Hypoxemia</measure>
    <time_frame>the initial 48 hours of postoperative monitoring or for the duration of hospitalization, if shorter.</time_frame>
    <description>Hypoxemia is measured as minutes with hypoxemia (Spo2 &lt;90%) per hour of successful Spo2 monitoring. Patients will have nearly continuous pulseoximeter monitoring and recording. Data from the monitor will be downloaded daily for 48 hours postoperatively.</description>

    <measure>Time-weighted Pain Score During Initial 48 Postoperative Hours</measure>
    <time_frame>Initial 48 postoperative hours or duration of hospitalization (whichever comes first)</time_frame>
    <description>Pain scores were calculated on a visual analog scale of 0 to 10, with 0 being no pain and 10 being the most pain imaginable; time weighted mean was calculated as the area under the curve of the pain score measurements divided by total measurement time. Pain was recorded at roughly 15-minute intervals in the postanesthesia care unit and at 4-hour intervals on surgical wards</description>

    <description>Pain scores were calculated on a visual analog scale of 0 to 10, with 0 being no pain and 10 being the most pain imaginable; time-weighted mean was calculated as the area under the curve of the pain score measurements divided by total measurement time.</description>

    <measure>Lowest RASS Score During Initial 48 Postoperative Hours</measure>
    <time_frame>Initial 48 postoperative hours or duration of hospitalization (whichever comes first)</time_frame>
    <description>Sedation was estimated by the RASS score and recorded at 2-hour intervals by ward nurses per clinical routine during the initial 48 postoperative hours. The Richmond Agitation-Sedation Scale (RASS) is scored from -5 to +4, with -5 being unarousable, 0 being alert and calm, and +4 being combative.</description>

    <measure>Incidence of Postoperative Nausea and Vomiting</measure>
    <time_frame>Initial 48 postoperative hours or duration of hospitalization (whichever comes first)</time_frame>

          <description>Sedation was estimated by the RASS score and recorded at 2-hour intervals by ward nurses per clinical routine during the initial 48 postoperative hours. The Richmond Agitation-Sedation Scale (RASS) is scored from -5 to +4, with -5 being unarousable, 0 being alert and calm, and +4 being combative.</description>
