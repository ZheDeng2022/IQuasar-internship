  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This randomized clinical trial studies how molecular profiling and targeted therapy work in&#xD;
      treating patients with cancer that has spread to other places in the body compared to&#xD;
      standard treatment. Information about genetic differences in a patient's tumor can be used to&#xD;
      choose treatment that may target the tumor. It is not yet validated whether selecting&#xD;
      treatment after studying the genetic changes that are associated with cancer in a patient's&#xD;
      tumor is a better way to treat patients with metastatic cancer compared to therapy not based&#xD;
      on studying the genetic changes that are associated with cancer.&#xD;

      I. To determine whether patients treated with a matched targeted therapy selected on the&#xD;
      basis of genomic alteration analysis of the tumor have longer progression-free survival from&#xD;
      the time of randomization than those whose treatment is not selected on the basis of&#xD;
      alteration analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: After completion of molecular profiling, patients who qualify for the trial will be&#xD;
      offered randomization as previously. If they wish to be randomized, patients will be&#xD;
      randomized to one of the two arms: matched targeted therapy (ARM I) or other therapy (ARM&#xD;
      II). Patients who decline to be randomized will then be offered their choice of the two trial&#xD;
      arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM I: Matched targeted therapy: Molecular profiling results are used to assign targeted&#xD;
      therapy. Patients receive targeted therapy by participating in a Phase I or a Phase II&#xD;
      clinical trial. If a clinical trial is not available, and a commercially available targeted&#xD;
      therapy exists (Food and Drug Administration [FDA]-approved for another indication), patients&#xD;
      can receive the FDA-approved drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM II: Other therapy: Patients receive standard of care therapy at the discretion of the&#xD;
      treating physician.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with tumor progression who achieve the primary study endpoint can cross over to the&#xD;
      other treatment arm.&#xD;
