      Study design&#xD;
&#xD;
      The MICOLON study is a prospective, single-centre, observational cohort study on the&#xD;
      association between 5th generation high sensitive cardiac troponin T levels and non-cardiac&#xD;
      outcome after major abdominal surgery in patients at risk for coronary artery disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient eligibility&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients are eligible to enter the study if they are scheduled to undergo elective major&#xD;
      abdominal surgery with an expected postoperative mortality rate &gt;3%, are aged 45 years or&#xD;
      older and have at least one of the following major cardiac risk factors: diabetes mellitus,&#xD;
      peripheral artery disease (i.e. intermittent claudication or history of vascular surgery&#xD;
      except arteriovenous shunt and vein stripping procedures), history of hospitalization for&#xD;
      congestive heart failure, history of myocardial infarction, stable angina pectoris, history&#xD;
      of coronary artery bypass grafting or percutaneous coronary angioplasty, renal insufficiency&#xD;
      (defined as preoperative creatinine &gt;150 μmol/L), history of cerebral vascular event, aortic&#xD;
      valve stenosis (defined as aortic valve area &lt;1 cm2), atrial fibrillation, moderate or poor&#xD;
      left ventricular function (defined as left ventricular ejection fraction &lt;55%), or two of the&#xD;
      following minor risk factors for coronary artery disease: age &gt;70 years, hypertension,&#xD;
      hypercholesterolemia, history of transient ischemic attack, chronic obstructive pulmonary&#xD;
      disease, smoking or low functional capacity (capable of physical activity of 4 metabolic&#xD;
      equivalents or less). Patients are excluded from study participation if they have no signed&#xD;
      informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study procedure&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients eligible for the study are identified at the outpatient preoperative anesthesiology&#xD;
      clinic. Patients are examined and screened for cardiac risk factors by an anesthesiology&#xD;
      resident or a dedicated screening nurse. Results of preoperative laboratory tests, data on&#xD;
      patient characteristics and preoperative use of cardiovascular drugs (i.e. statin,&#xD;
      ß--blocker, platelet inhibitor, calcium antagonists, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor&#xD;
      and angiotensine receptor blocker) were noted. Prior to any study procedure written informed&#xD;
      consent is obtained from all patients. During the study period blood is collected for plasma&#xD;
      troponin T measurements after induction of general anesthesia (baseline) and on the 1st, 3rd&#xD;
      and 7th postoperative day. All plasma samples are frozen and stored at -20°C at the&#xD;
      hospital's laboratory until analysis. Cardiac troponin T batch analysis is performed every 3&#xD;
      weeks with the use of 5th generation Elecsys Troponin T high sensitive assay on an automated&#xD;
      Cobas 6000 platform (Roche Diagnostics, Germany). The limit of detection of this high&#xD;
      sensitive assay was determined at 3 ng/L with a 99th percentile upper reference limit of 14&#xD;
      ng/L. In addition, plasma creatinine levels are measured in each sample with an enzymatic&#xD;
      method on the same automated platform (Roche Diagnostics, Germany). An estimated glomerular&#xD;
      filtration rate is calculated from plasma creatinine values using the Modification of Diet in&#xD;
      Renal Disease formula. During the entire study period daily routine quality control samples&#xD;
      for troponin and creatinine ensure comparable patient data across different reagent lots.&#xD;
      After analysis the samples are stored at -80°C.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Surgical procedures are performed under general anesthesia or a combination of general and&#xD;
      epidural anesthesia. Anesthesia management is left to the discretion of the attending&#xD;
      anesthesiologist. According to hospital protocol, patients scheduled for gastric-esophageal,&#xD;
      pancreatic or hepatic surgery and patients aged ≥80 or with an American Association of&#xD;
      Anesthesiologists physical status classification system ≥3 will be admitted to an intensive&#xD;
      care unit postoperatively for at least 24 hours. To improve postoperative recovery all&#xD;
      patients are treated according to the current Enhanced Recovery After Surgery guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the postoperative period research personnel performs patient visits, reviews medical&#xD;
      charts and notes complications. At thirty days after surgery troponin results are reported to&#xD;
      the researchers and a follow-up telephone interview is performed if patients are discharged&#xD;
      from the hospital at that time. Patients will be asked if a medical complication has occurred&#xD;
      since their discharge from the hospital. If so, medical details are retrieved from their&#xD;
      treating physicians. Information from routine postoperative clinic visits is used if patients&#xD;
      can not be reached by telephone. Noted endpoints are judged by an event committee, that is&#xD;
      blinded for troponin results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Endpoint definition&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary parameter of the study is postoperative myocardial injury at day 1, 3 or 7. Secondary&#xD;
      parameters are met by the occurrence of any of the following non-cardiac events within 30&#xD;
      days after surgery: mortality - defined as death without cardiovascular origin; sepsis -&#xD;
      defined as systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) in response to a proven or&#xD;
      suspected microbial infection; pneumonia - defined as purulent sputum or isolation of a&#xD;
      pathogen from sputum culture or blood culture and clinical symptoms (e.g. dyspnea, fever,&#xD;
      cough) or a consolidation or pleural effusion on chest radiograph; respiratory failure -&#xD;
      defined as non-cardiac hypoxia or hypercapnia leading to ICU (re)admission for respiratory&#xD;
      support (e.g. (non)invasive ventilation or high concentration oxygen therapy); anastomotic&#xD;
      dehiscence - defined as presence of luminal contents through drain or wound site causing&#xD;
      local inflammation or SIRS, or leak detected on imaging studies in combination with clinical&#xD;
      signs of SIRS; intestinal ischemia - defined as signs of superficial or transmural bowel&#xD;
      ischemia on imaging studies and clinical symptoms (e.g. abdominal pain or tenderness) or&#xD;
      SIRS; wound infection - purulent drainage from superficial incision or deliberate opening of&#xD;
      superficial incision by surgeon and clinical signs of local inflammation (e.g. pain,&#xD;
      tenderness, swelling, redness); bleeding - defined as abnormal postoperative bleeding needing&#xD;
      surgical (i.e. re-operation) or endovascular (i.e. coiling) treatment. Other study parameters&#xD;
      were length of hospital stay and in-hospital mortality.&#xD;
