      OBJECTIVES&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To determine the prevalence and incidence of anal HPV infection, including infection&#xD;
           with high-risk HPV types, among MSM in Indonesia, Malaysia, and Thailand.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To study the prevalence and incidence of HGAIN among these MSM.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To evaluate risk factors, including HIV status, for anal high-risk HPV infection and&#xD;
           HGAIN among these MSM.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population An approximately 75 HIV-positive and 75 HIV-negative MSM who attended the&#xD;
      study clinic in Kuala Lumpur, Jakarta, and Bangkok will be enrolled. The study will also&#xD;
      enroll 185 HIV-positive and 95 HIV-negative MSM who are previous participants of the MSM VCT&#xD;
      study. There will be approximately 260 HIV-positive and 170 HIV-negative MSM in total in this&#xD;
