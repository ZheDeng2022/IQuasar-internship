  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The use of cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) combined with one lung ventilation (OLV) allows to&#xD;
      perform minimally invasive cardiac surgery (MICS) through small incisions. MICS is described&#xD;
      to be associated with similar outcomes compared with conventional surgery. Although less&#xD;
      invasive, MICS has not been reported to favorably impact the incidence of respiratory failure&#xD;
      after surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The combination CPB and OLV may induce acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). After CPB&#xD;
      contact of blood components with the artificial surface of the bypass, lung ischemia&#xD;
      reperfusion injury (LIRI) and operative trauma may trigger a systemic inflammatory response&#xD;
      syndrome (SIRS). During OLV, ARDS can result from hyperoxia, hyperperfusion and ventilatory&#xD;
      distress in the ventilated lung as well as from LIRI and operative trauma of the collapsed&#xD;
      lung.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Extravascular lung water (EVLW) includes all fluids in the lung except for those in the&#xD;
      vascular compartment. An excess of EVLW may lead to respiratory insufficiency. This may be&#xD;
      due to an increased hydrostatic intravascular pressure, as it occurs in cardiogenic pulmonary&#xD;
      edema, and/or by an increase of lung endothelial and epithelial permeability, as in ARDS. The&#xD;
      extravascular lung water index (EVLWI) assessed by the transpulmonary thermodilution&#xD;
      technique may be a useful tool for accurate diagnosis of ARDS, and the pulmonary vascular&#xD;
      permeability index (PVPI) may help in the differentiation between pulmonary edema due to an&#xD;
      increase in the pulmonary capillary permeability versus an increase in the pulmonary&#xD;
      capillary hydrostatic pressure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As both CPB and OLV may induce an excess of EVLW, the investigators hypothesize that patients&#xD;
      after MICS with intraoperative combination of CPB and OLV may have higher EVLWI and PVPI than&#xD;
      those who received either CPB or OLV alone.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) occur with an incidence of 12% after cardiac&#xD;
      surgery with the use of cardiopulmonary bypass (CBP). Using one-lung ventilation (OLV) in&#xD;
      addition, as it is common practice in minimally invasive cardiac surgery (MICS), one can&#xD;
      hypothesize that the risk for ARDS increases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this prospective, observational study is to measure extravascular lung water&#xD;
      index (EVLWI) and pulmonary vascular permeability index (PVPI) as parameters of lung edema&#xD;
      through alteration in the pulmonary permeability by comparing three groups of surgery&#xD;
      patients: I) patients with CPB, II) patients with OLV and III) patients with both CPB and&#xD;
      OLV.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MICS allows coronary artery bypass grafting and cardiac valve surgery through small&#xD;
      incisions, does not appear to be inferior to conventional surgery, but likely reduces&#xD;
      postoperative pain, accelerates postoperative recovery and improves the cosmetic result.&#xD;
      However, based on the available data, respiratory failure after MICS occurs at the same rate&#xD;
      as after conventional cardiac surgery. In addition, unilateral re-expansion pulmonary edema,&#xD;
      rarely seen after conventional cardiac surgery, has been described after MICS with CPB and&#xD;
      OLV.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The pathophysiology of ARDS is characterized by massive inflammation that leads to a diffuse&#xD;
      damage of both the alveolar epithelium and pulmonary vascular endothelium. Although the&#xD;
      etiology of ARDS is multifactorial, the uniform result is an acute, nonhydrostatic,&#xD;
      high-permeability lung injury with interstitial and alveolar protein-rich edema, epithelial&#xD;
      damage and rapid onset of pulmonary fibrosis. This leads to the vast reduction of the&#xD;
      pulmonary gas exchange and to hypoxemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Extravascular lung water (EVLW) comprises all fluids of the extravascular compartment of the&#xD;
      lung, ie, intracellular water, lymphatic fluid, surfactant and extravasated plasma. Increased&#xD;
      EVLW may be caused by an increased hydrostatic intravascular pressure, as it occurs in&#xD;
      cardiogenic pulmonary edema, and/or by an increase of lung endothelial and epithelial&#xD;
      permeability, as in ARDS. The EVLWI estimates the EVLW by using the transpulmonary&#xD;
      thermodilution technique.The pulmonary vascular permeability index (PVPI) is the ratio&#xD;
      between the EVLWI and the pulmonary blood volume, which is also measured by the&#xD;
      transpulmonary thermodilution technique. The PVPI is thought to reflect the permeability of&#xD;
      the alveolar-capillary barrier.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The combination of CPB and OLV permitted the development of MICS. CPB is an extracorporeal&#xD;
      circulation, where a heart-lung machine takes over temporarily the pump function of the heart&#xD;
      and the oxygenation and ventilation function of the lungs, thereby, allowing various heart&#xD;
      and vascular surgical procedures. During CPB, blood from the right side of the heart is&#xD;
      drained into the heart-lung machine and returned into the arterial system. This leads to a&#xD;
      hypoperfusion of the lung, while blood flow is maintained only through the bronchial artery.&#xD;
      OLV allows the surgeon to access the thorax cavity for the operation, while contralateral&#xD;
      lung is ventilated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It was originally thought that the lung is relatively resistant to ischemia due to its dual&#xD;
      circulation. However, re-perfusion of the lung after CPB and/or OLV can trigger a fatal&#xD;
      cascade, summarized as lung ischemia reperfusion injury (LIRI). LIRI involves intracellular&#xD;
      injury and pertinent inflammatory responses, which result in apoptosis of the endothelium,&#xD;
      alveolar capillary interstitial edema, hyaline membranization, and infiltration by&#xD;
      neutrophils and macrophages. In addition, during CPB, the contact of blood components with&#xD;
      the artificial surface of the bypass circuit contribute to the postoperative systemic&#xD;
      inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS). Through these mechanisms, lung compliance and&#xD;
      resistance as well as pulmonary permeability are affected, which contributes to the&#xD;
      development of ARDS. During OLV, a combination of LIRI as well as surgical trauma and lung&#xD;
      hyperinflation may lead to the release of inflammatory mediators which can alter endovascular&#xD;
      permeability. Additionally, after thoracic surgery the pulmonary vascular permeability&#xD;
      increases and re-expansion of the collapsed lungs may result in the so called re-expansion&#xD;
      pulmonary edema.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To the best of the investigators knowledge, no study primarily aimed at examining the&#xD;
      relationship between MICS and lung injury, although it is of high clinical interest whether&#xD;
      the combination of CPB and OLV during MICS leads to increased EVLW and pulmonary permeability&#xD;
      and ARDS.&#xD;
