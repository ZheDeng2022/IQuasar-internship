  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Many parents who have lost a child use counseling or other resources to help with the&#xD;
      emotional burden of their loss. The aim of this study is to begin to test a new counseling&#xD;
      program for parents who have lost a child.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There are two parts to this study. Adapting and refining the MCGT intervention manual will be&#xD;
      accomplished primarily in Part 1, building upon a preparatory project to obtain feedback on&#xD;
      the MCGT intervention manual and materials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Step 1 of Part 1 will involve a brief open trial of MCGT delivered in person at an MSK&#xD;
      location with individual parents (n=5) to further refine the treatment through active&#xD;
      participant feedback and identify ways to improve therapeutic alliance to maximize the impact&#xD;
      of delivery via videoconferencing. Parents may also invite a support provider to join them&#xD;
      for Session 9 (support provider n = 5). Support providers will not be evaluated as research&#xD;
      participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Step 2 of Part 1 will be another brief open trial (n=5) delivering MCGT via video&#xD;
      conferencing to iron out any logistical challenges prior to the pilot randomized controlled&#xD;
      trial (RCT). The investigators hope to use videoconferencing in order to ultimately improve&#xD;
      parents' access to supportive services. Participants will be able to complete sessions&#xD;
      wherever they have both privacy and access to a computer and the internet. Parents may also&#xD;
      invite a support provider to join them for Session 9 (support provider n = 5). Support&#xD;
      providers will not be evaluated as research participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All Part 1 participants will be assessed pre-intervention (T1), mid-intervention (T2),&#xD;
      post-intervention (T3), and at 3-months post-intervention (T4). A qualitative exit interview&#xD;
      will also be conducted post-intervention. This interview will be audio recorded. Video&#xD;
      recording of the exit interview will be optional. Throughout both steps, parent testimonials&#xD;
      that address barriers to accessing mental health services will be obtained to assist in Part&#xD;
      2 outreach and recruitment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 1 will be conducted with parents experiencing elevated PGD symptoms as measured by the&#xD;
      PG-13, a 13-item self-report scale evaluating PGD symptom severity, duration, and impairment.&#xD;
      For this study, PG-13 scores ≥ 34 will be considered indicative of elevated PGD symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 2 will be used to obtain information about the feasibility, tolerability, acceptability,&#xD;
      and effect size estimates of MCGT (delivered via video conferencing) to assist in planning a&#xD;
      larger, efficacy RCT. These goals will be accomplished by undertaking a parallel-arm RCT&#xD;
      comparing the refined MCGT to a standardized supportive psychotherapy (SP), both one-on-one&#xD;
      interventions delivered via videoconferencing, which numerous studies show is as efficacious&#xD;
      as in-person delivery.15-17 Parents (n=56) with PG-13 scores ≥ 34 will be randomized to&#xD;
      receive MCGT or SP to compare their relative feasibility, acceptability, tolerability, and&#xD;
      preliminary effects. As in Part 1, participants will be assessed pre-intervention (T1),&#xD;
      mid-intervention (T2), post-intervention (T3), and at 3-months post-intervention (T4). All&#xD;
      psychotherapy sessions for Part 1 will need to be completed before Part 2 begins. The&#xD;
      investigators expect that they will be able to begin Part 2 of the protocol (during which&#xD;
      recruits 56 parents) approximately 3 months after the final parent is enrolled in Part 1,&#xD;
      Step 2. Approximately 56 parents (individuals) will complete the intervention in Part&#xD;
      2.Parents randomized to MCGT may also invite a support provider to join them for Session 9&#xD;
      (support provider n = 28). Support providers will not be evaluated as research participants.&#xD;
      1-2 training cases per MCGT interventionist (rather than randomized) will also be enrolled on&#xD;
      this study for training purposes. There may be weeks where sessions do not take place and/or&#xD;
      weeks where more than one session takes place in a week.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Past participants on the study may also be contacted to join a Parent Advisory Board (PAB)&#xD;
      Potential members of PAB may also be identified from the community. Members of the PAB will&#xD;
      be invited to provide their perspectives, ideas, and feedback on the intervention and ongoing&#xD;
      and future research.&#xD;

    <description>Part 1: Open Trials. Participants (n = 5 for Step 1 &amp; n = 5 for Step 2) will receive 16 1-hour (approx) weekly sessions MCGT, &amp; all therapy sessions will be audio recorded. Will make every effort to complete 16 sessions in 16 weeks, due to normal life activities, this is considered an approximation (i.e. there may be weeks where sessions don't take place &amp;/or weeks where more than 1 session takes place in a week). If participant provides us with permission, we will also video record the sessions. Assessments will be administered at 4 time points: pre-intervention (T1), mid-intervention (T2), post-intervention (T3), &amp; at 3-months post-intervention (T4). They will provide their feedback about MCGT &amp; the measures. PI will review the open trial sessions to help refine the MCGT manual &amp; treatment integrity forms. Sessions for Step 1 participants in Part 1 will be held at the MSK Counseling Center. Sessions for Step 2 participants in Part 1 will be conducted via videoconferencing.</description>

    <description>Part 2: Pilot RCT. Will randomize 66 parents to 16 weekly 60-90 minute (approx) sessions of MCGT or SP delivered via videoconferencing. Again, sessions will be audio recorded. If the participant provides us with permission, we also audio/video record the sessions. We will examine aspects of study implementation &amp; therapy process, including a) recruitment progress, b) implementation of the intervention, c) administration of the assessments, &amp; d) retention. We will also examine acceptability, defined as measures of satisfaction at T3. Psychosocial outcomes will be assessed with self-report measures at 4 time points: pre-intervention (T1), mid-intervention (T2), post-intervention (T3), &amp; at 3-months post-intervention (T4). Post-intervention qualitative exit interviews will assess acceptability of the intervention. Post-intervention qualitative exit interviews will assess acceptability of the MCGT intervention .</description>
