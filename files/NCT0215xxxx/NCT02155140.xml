  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients due to undergo surgery for oesophageal and gastric malignancy are often&#xD;
      malnourished. Up to 10% of patients preoperative weight may also be lost during the early&#xD;
      postoperative period. Following discharge from hospital the mechanics of the surgery leads to&#xD;
      a loss of gastric reservoir function, lack of appetite, altered intestinal motility and&#xD;
      gastro-oesophageal reflux which usually results in reduced dietary intake and further weight&#xD;
      loss. In patients who have undergone upper gastrointestinal resections there are no studies&#xD;
      examining the benefit of nutritional supplementation following hospital discharge, however,&#xD;
      studies in other groups of surgical patients have failed to show benefit. Despite patients&#xD;
      who have undergone upper gastrointestinal surgery being 'at risk' nutritionally, there is no&#xD;
      evidence demonstrating the value or not of nutritional supplementation following hospital&#xD;
      discharge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: The postoperative under nutrition seen after upper gastrointestinal surgery will&#xD;
      exacerbate the reduced quality of life and fatigue patients' already experience. The&#xD;
      investigators hypothesise that improving patient's nutritional intake following hospital&#xD;
      discharge will improve their quality of life and fatigue levels.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      For patients undergoing upper gastrointestinal (GI) surgery for cancer:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Because of the nature of upper gastrointestinal surgery these patients have been shown&#xD;
           to suffer undernutrition and weight loss after hospital discharge (up to 3 months) and&#xD;
           to a greater extent than other groups of surgical patients. Quality of life and fatigue&#xD;
           is a major issue after upper GI surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Nutritional supplementation via a jejunostomy after hospital discharge is only done&#xD;
           routinely for all patients in 10%, and for selected patients in 20% of United Kingdom&#xD;
           (UK) hospitals.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Derriford hospital is very unusual in that 85% of patients are given home jejunal&#xD;
           feeding.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. In Devon and Cornwall home enteral nutrition is delivered under contract by Fresenius&#xD;
           Kabil (a global health care company).&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. There are no studies of home nutritional supplementation in upper GI surgical patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Studies of home nutritional supplementation in surgical patients having undergone&#xD;
           colorectal surgery have not shown clinical or Quality of Life (QoL) benefit despite&#xD;
           weight gain.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. The process of enteral nutrition may be associated with a reduction in quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. There is a need for a clinical trial to establish the benefit of home enteral&#xD;
           nutritional supplementation. The results of any such trial may influence the highly&#xD;
           variable nutritional present practice and may influence the surgeons desire to place a&#xD;
           feeding jejunostomy (or not) at surgery which is associated with clinical complications.&#xD;

    <description>We will use the oesophagus specific quality of life (QLQ-OES18) scale. The QLQ-OES18 scale is a disease specific Health-related quality of life (HRQL) questionnaire, designed to examine the influence of upper gastrointestinal pathology on patients and improvement in HRQL following treatment.</description>
