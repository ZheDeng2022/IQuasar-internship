      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Studies show that Internet Support Groups (ISGs) can help parents of children with chronic&#xD;
      conditions. Researchers want to find out if ISGs can help parents of a child with the genetic&#xD;
      disorder Neurofibromatosis Type 1 (NF1).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To see if an ISG for parents with a child with NF1 can give the parents more social support&#xD;
      and less anxiety.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Adults age 18 and older with a child (age 0 25 years) with NF1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will register for the study on a website hosted by the Children s Tumor&#xD;
           Foundation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will complete 5 questionnaires. These will be about their emotional&#xD;
           well-being, their child s health status, and their contact information.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The ISG will include a Discussion Forum that participants can enter 24 hours a day, 7&#xD;
           days a week. A professional moderator will post questions and discussion topics. The&#xD;
           moderator can also respond to questions. They will be a psychologist, a psychology&#xD;
           associate, or a nurse-practitioner. Each one will be highly experienced at working with&#xD;
           young people with NF1 and their families.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The ISG also will contain a chat room. Here participants can chat with other users in&#xD;
           real time. The chat room will be open for one 90-minute session per week.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The ISG will remain open for 8 weeks. Then participants will retake 4 of the&#xD;
           questionnaires from the beginning of the study. They will also complete 1 other&#xD;
           questionnaire about their experiences with the ISG. Information from any messages&#xD;
           participants post on the ISG website will be collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Three months after the ISG closes, participants will complete the questionnaires one&#xD;
           final time.&#xD;

      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The complex symptom profile in NF1 puts children and adolescents with this condition at&#xD;
           risk for a variety of physical, cognitive, and social-emotional difficulties. Thus,&#xD;
           caring for a child with a chronic medical condition such as NF1 can be challenging.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Over the last two decades, researchers have been examining the use of internet support&#xD;
           groups (ISGs) as a means of connecting individuals with similar conditions, diagnoses,&#xD;
           or challenges to provide emotional and informational support.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  While the benefits of ISGs have been well documented in many studies of medical&#xD;
           patients, very few have examined the use of ISGs in parents of children with chronic&#xD;
           medical conditions. Further, no studies have been conducted on an ISG in parents of a&#xD;
           child with NF1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The primary objective of this pilot study is to assess the effectiveness of an ISG&#xD;
           designed for parents of children with NF1 on a measure of perceived social support.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Secondary objectives are to assess effects of the ISG on self-efficacy, depression, and&#xD;
           anxiety, and to explore themes and topics discussed in the ISG.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ELIGIBILITY:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible participants must self-report:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Being greater than or equal to 18 years of age&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Having a child with a diagnosis of NF1 between 0 and 25 years of age&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Living in the same home as the child with NF1&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Having regular access to a computer with internet capability&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Parents of children with NF1 will be recruited through Dr. Widemann s NF1 patient&#xD;
           database and through the Children s Tumor Foundation s (CTF) NF registry.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Eligible participants will be emailed a link to access the study website through the CTF&#xD;
           website. Due to the nature of the study, consent will be obtained online.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  After consenting, participants will be administered (electronically) baseline measures&#xD;
           of perceived social support, self-efficacy, depression, and anxiety. After 8 weeks,&#xD;
           participants will complete the measures again via the same website, as well as a&#xD;
           post-study questionnaire assessing their experiences with participation. Measures will&#xD;
           be repeated at 3-months post-intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Content analyses will be performed to identify themes and needs of the participants&#xD;
