      The investigators aim to study the heterogeneity of fluorescence within malignant gliomas by&#xD;
      sampling tissues from these variable areas within the same tumor. These tissue samples will&#xD;
      then be subjected to pathological and biological analysis to assess proteins related to ALA&#xD;
      metabolism and correlated with the fluorescence emitted as well as levels of protoporphyrin&#xD;
      IX in the tissues.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Malignant gliomas are the commonest malignant brain tumors but are extremely challenging to&#xD;
      treat. Neuro-oncology has seen little progress in its treatment despite extensive research.&#xD;
      Extent of resection remains a very important prognostic factor in these tumors. Better the&#xD;
      resection, better the outcomes. However resecting these tumors is not very easy primarily due&#xD;
      to their infiltrative nature and difficulty in discerning tumor boundaries intraoperatively.&#xD;
      Fluorescence guided resection (FGR) has recently been shown to be a very important and useful&#xD;
      adjunct in maximizing this goal. FGR involves administration of aminolevulinic acid (ALA) to&#xD;
      the patient prior to surgery. The ALA is converted to protoporphyrin IX (PPIX) in glioma&#xD;
      cells. The PPIX is a fluorophore and can be visualized intraoperatively using a suitably&#xD;
      modified microscope. Neurosurgeons can then resect the tumor radically guided by this&#xD;
      fluorescence which is superior to the conventional microscopic resection. Selective PPIX&#xD;
      accumulation in glioma cells is the key to the accuracy of this technique. The biological&#xD;
      basis of selectivity of PPIX accumulation within glioma cells is however poorly understood.&#xD;
      Various mechanisms could be involved starting from variable transport (related to blood-brain&#xD;
      barrier properties), differential uptake (governed by active transport mechanisms) and&#xD;
      differential metabolism within the cell. Understanding these mechanisms can lead to&#xD;
      refinements in this strategy, overcoming its present limitations and development of methods&#xD;
      to extend its scope.&#xD;

    <description>Prior to surgery all patients would receive freshly prepared solution of 5-ALA, 20 mg/kg bodyweight dissolved in 100 ml of potable water orally approximately 4 hours (range 4-6 hrs) before the commencement of anesthesia induction for surgery.&#xD;
The surgery would then be performed with the help of navigation. After craniotomy, the navigation software would be used to identify the selected target areas based on the preoperative images (MR as well as PET when available) and directed image-guided biopsies from these representative areas will be collected for histological evaluation</description>
