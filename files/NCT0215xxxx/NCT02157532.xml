    <textblock>
      Stroke constitutes the primary cause of acquired disability in adults and the second cause of&#xD;
      dementia following Alzheimer disease. It has been shown that patients with a moderate to&#xD;
      severe clinical score have occlusion of brain large vessels, resulting in a worse clinical&#xD;
      outcome. Many studies have demonstrated that early recanalization after IV rtPA is more&#xD;
      restricted, the larger and more proximal the artery. Several systems for mechanical&#xD;
      intracranial arterial thrombectomy of large trunks have recently been proposed and are now&#xD;
      available. Potential advantages of these mechanical systems on chemical thrombolysis are&#xD;
      speed (a few minutes versus 1 hour) and absence of thrombolytic injection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of the EASI trial is thus to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To validate intra-arterial thrombectomy use during the acute phase of cerebral stroke in&#xD;
           patients treated with IV thrombolysis or in patients for whom thrombolysis is&#xD;
           contra-indicated.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine whether a combined approach, standard treatment plus thrombectomy, is&#xD;
           superior to standard treatment alone within 5 h of the appearance of symptoms, in&#xD;
           patients with occlusion of proximal cerebral arteries following moderate to severe&#xD;
           stroke (NIHSS larger than or equal to 8), evaluated at 3 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The design is a randomized, controlled multicentric trial, with a parallel comparison between&#xD;
      standard and combined (standard plus thrombectomy) treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      480 patients fulfilling eligibility criteria will be sufficient to demonstrate the primary&#xD;
      hypothesis of a 15% difference in number of subjects with a favorable mRS (less than or equal&#xD;
      to 2) at 3 months, with the assumption of a 25% efficacy for IV thrombolytic treatment at 3&#xD;
      months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV thrombolysis is carried out according to standard practice. Mechanical thrombectomy is&#xD;
      carried out with already approved devices, according to the manufacturer's instructions,&#xD;
      following a diagnostic cerebral angiography.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary efficacy endpoint is clinical: favorable mRS (less than or equal to 2) at 3&#xD;
      months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary safety endpoint is rate of death at 3 months and rate of symptomatic hemorrhage&#xD;
      at 24 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the primary hypothesis is validated, expected benefits of this study is a higher rate of&#xD;
      autonomy for stroke patients with all the attendant consequences: reduction in hospital&#xD;
      stays, and a faster return to the activities of daily life.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Background Stroke constitutes the primary cause of acquired disability in adults and the&#xD;
      second cause of dementia following Alzheimer disease. The burden of disease may be&#xD;
      substantial since 25% of the victims of stroke are younger than 65 years. Standard treatment&#xD;
      is IV rtPA thrombolysis, within 3-4.5 hours of first signs. It has been shown that patients&#xD;
      with a moderate to severe clinical score (NIHSS more than 10) have occlusion of proximal&#xD;
      large vessels, resulting in a more adverse clinical outcome. Many studies have demonstrated&#xD;
      that early recanalization after IV rtPA is more restricted, the larger and more proximal the&#xD;
      artery. Recanalization of large arteries occurs more frequently and earlier (leading to&#xD;
      better prognosis) with arterial than with venous access. Biochemical arterial treatment&#xD;
      appears thus of greater efficacy in terms of recanalization of large vessels, but more&#xD;
      inconvenient with respect to setup delays. Several systems for mechanical intracranial&#xD;
      arterial thrombectomy of large trunks have recently been proposed and are now available.&#xD;
      Results of short case series and prospective multicentric non randomized studies appear&#xD;
      favorable. The thrombus obstructing the artery is reached by endovascular means and&#xD;
      mechanically removed with the result that orthograde blood flow is re-established in the&#xD;
      cerebral territory involved in the ischemia. Potential advantages of these mechanical systems&#xD;
      on chemical thrombolysis are speed (a few minutes versus 1 hour) and absence of thrombolytic&#xD;
      injection. Mechanical thrombolysis should thus lead to better results than injection of an&#xD;
      arterial thrombolytic agent, as well as increase the time window for treatment. In addition,&#xD;
      hemorrhagic complications should be reduced.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
      In situations where IV rtPA thrombolysis is not optimal, that is in presumed embolic&#xD;
      occlusions of large intracranial arterial trunks (terminal carotid, initial segment of the&#xD;
      MCA, distal third of the basilar trunk) with a moderate to severe clinical state (NIHSS&#xD;
      greater or equal to 8) and in situations when IV rtPA may be contra-indicated:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To validate intra-arterial thrombectomy use during the acute phase of cerebral stroke in&#xD;
           patients treated with IV thrombolysis or in patients for whom thrombolysis is&#xD;
           contra-indicated.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine whether a combined approach, standard treatment plus thrombectomy, is&#xD;
           superior to standard treatment alone within 5 h of the appearance of symptoms, in&#xD;
           patients with occlusion of proximal cerebral arteries following moderate to severe&#xD;
           stroke (greater or equal to 8), evaluated at 3 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design EASI is a randomized, controlled multicentric trial, with a parallel comparison&#xD;
      between standard and combined (standard plus thrombectomy) treatment. All adults presenting&#xD;
      less than 5 hours after the beginning of symptoms with an NIHSS greater or equal to 8&#xD;
      discordant with imaging data are eligible. Occlusion site, when available, includes&#xD;
      intracranial carotid artery, M1 segment of middle cerebral and basilar artery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      480 patients fulfilling eligibility criteria will be sufficient to demonstrate the primary&#xD;
      hypothesis of a 15% difference in number of subjects with a favorable mRS (greater than 2) at&#xD;
      3 months, with the assumption of a 25% efficacy (mRS less or equal to 2) for IV thrombolytic&#xD;
      treatment at 3 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization may take place any time following admission, including during IV thrombolysis.&#xD;
      The choice of early randomization, without knowledge of the clinical or angiographic results&#xD;
      of IV thrombolysis fulfils several objectives: allow timely delivery of a proven treatment;&#xD;
      prevent unnecessary exposure to angiography risks; set up thrombectomy as fast as possible&#xD;
      for a maximal efficacy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV thrombolysis is carried out according to standard practice. Mechanical thrombectomy is&#xD;
      carried out with already approved devices, according to the manufacturer's instructions,&#xD;
      following a diagnostic cerebral angiography.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up includes brain imaging and the mRS at 3 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Endpoint measures include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Clinical endpoints as measured by the neurologist, and include the NIHSS at baseline and&#xD;
           the mRS at 3 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Safety data: complications, death at 3 months, hemorrhage according to 24 hours CT scan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary efficacy endpoint is clinical: favorable mRS (less than or equal to 2) at 3&#xD;
      months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary safety endpoint is rate of death at 3 months and rate of symptomatic hemorrhage&#xD;
      at 24 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary efficacy endpoints include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Comparison of ASPECTS score between baseline and 24 hours CT scans&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In thrombectomy group, blood flow in treated territory as measured by a TICI reperfusion&#xD;
           score of 2 or 3 at end of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary safety endpoints include&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Rate of hemorrhage on 24 hours CT scan&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Frequency and severity of complications of standard treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Frequency and severity of arterial complications in thrombectomy group&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Frequency and severity of complications at puncture site in thrombectomy group&#xD;
