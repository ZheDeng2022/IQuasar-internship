  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test the safety and determine the maximum safe dose of an&#xD;
      experimental drug called LDE225 (hedgehog inhibitor) in people with liver cancer. We have&#xD;
      identified hedgehog dysregulation as a novel mechanism for hepatocarcinogenesis and hepatic&#xD;
      fibrosis/cirrhosis. Therefore, we hypothesize that the hedgehog inhibitor may be an ideal&#xD;
      drug target for treating both hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and Child-Pugh A cirrhosis&#xD;
      (CPA).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, single institution, Phase I, 3+3 dose escalation study of LDE225 in&#xD;
      patients with advanced or metastatic hepatocellular carcinoma and Child-Pugh A Cirrhosis who&#xD;
      are intolerant to sorafenib. The investigational treatment cycle (21 days) will consist of&#xD;
      daily oral LDE225.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dose escalation will be performed in serial patient cohorts. Up to six patients can be&#xD;
      studied at each dose level. Safety and clinical data will be tabulated and the decision to&#xD;
      open the next cohort level will be the responsibility of the principal investigator. Dose&#xD;
      escalation will be based on the dose-limiting toxicities encountered through Day 42 of&#xD;
      investigational treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be dosed on a flat scale of daily dosing of LDE225 prescribed by the dose&#xD;
      cohort.&#xD;
