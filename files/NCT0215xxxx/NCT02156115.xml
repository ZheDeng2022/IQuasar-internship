      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Lymphatics are a type of vessel, similar to arteries and veins. Lymphatic disorders happen&#xD;
      when these vessels don t work properly. Researchers want to look for a relationship between&#xD;
      lymphatic disorders and variations of certain genes found in the lung, blood, and other&#xD;
      places in the body.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To learn more about lymphatic disorders and evaluate how genetic factors affect lymphatic&#xD;
      disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  People ages 2 90 who have a lymphatic disorder or relatives of people with lymphatic&#xD;
           disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Healthy volunteers 18 and older.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants may have 1 2 visits a year, or more as needed. The study is expected to&#xD;
           last 5 years. Visits may last 1 5 days. Participants may have lab tests, medical&#xD;
           history, and physical exam at each visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants may have blood testing that includes genetics tests, and urine tests. They&#xD;
           may have nose and throat cultures, saliva collection, and cheek swabs to collect&#xD;
           samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants may have a skin biopsy and have blood taken from an artery.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants may have breathing tests and be studied while exercising.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants may have an electrocardiogram. Electrodes will be placed on their chest,&#xD;
           tracing heart rhythms. They may also have chest X-rays.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants may have a bronchoscopy. A thin, flexible instrument will be passed through&#xD;
           the nose or mouth, into the lung. A tissue sample will be taken.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants who have lymphatic disease or have a relative with it may also have:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  CT scans. They will lie on a table and hold their breath while their chest is scanned.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  MRI. They will lie flat on a table that slides in and out of a scanner.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  ultrasound. A probe is rolled around outside the abdomen.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  removal of fluid around the lungs, chest, and abdomen.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Disorders of lymphatic function are associated with multiple presentations, the most common&#xD;
      of which is lymphedema, a chronic swelling of the extremities, due to impaired lymphatic&#xD;
      drainage. It can cause disability and a predisposition to infection and chronic ulceration.&#xD;
      Other lymphatic disorders present with visceral manifestations such as regional or systemic&#xD;
      lymphangiomatosis, pulmonary and intestinal lymphangiectasia, protein-losing enteropathy,&#xD;
      chylous ascites, and chylothorax. Abnormalities of smooth muscle cell proliferation are&#xD;
      associated with lymphangiomatosis. Proliferation of a neoplastic cell, the LAM cell, which&#xD;
      exhibits a smooth muscle cell phenotype, is associated with lymphangioleiomyomatosis.&#xD;
      Currently, treatment for many of these disorders is symptomatic and the prognosis is&#xD;
      variable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The molecular mechanisms of lymphatic vasculogenesis are incompletely understood, but&#xD;
      critical genes have been described, and mutations in these genes may lead to developmental&#xD;
      abnormalities. There may be a genetic predisposition to lymphatic disorders, with a role for&#xD;
      modifier genes in disease progression. The purpose of this study is to (a) define the natural&#xD;
      history of lymphatic diseases, (b) characterize the clinical phenotypes, and (c) elucidate&#xD;
      their pathogenesis at the physiological, cellular and molecular levels. This protocol is part&#xD;
      of a Trans-Institute basic, translational and clinical initiative in lymphatic disorders and&#xD;
      will include participation of principal investigators across the NIH, as well as extramural&#xD;
      investigators.&#xD;
