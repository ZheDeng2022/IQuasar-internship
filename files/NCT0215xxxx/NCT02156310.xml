      Background: High blood pressure is a common complication observed in cancer patients&#xD;
      prescribed anti-VEGF drugs. Increased blood pressure increases the risk of heart attacks and&#xD;
      strokes, thus adversely affecting survival and quality of life in this patient group.&#xD;
      However, little is known about the mechanisms leading to high blood pressure with anti-VEGF&#xD;
      drugs. As a result, the management of anti-VEGF drug-induced hypertension is largely&#xD;
      empirical. A better knowledge of effects of specific blood pressure lowering drugs, i.e.&#xD;
      antihypertensives, on anti-VEGF drug-induced hypertension would optimize therapeutic&#xD;
      management and reduce the risk associated with hypertension and proteinuria in patients with&#xD;
      cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: Datasets of two completed GSK clinical trials using the anti-VEGF drug pazopanib,&#xD;
      i.e. VEG108844 and VEG105192, will be accessed to 1) determine the way blood pressure changes&#xD;
      over time after commencing anti-VEGF treatment; 2) identify whether there are any&#xD;
      relationships between pre-study and baseline blood pressure values, treatment with specific&#xD;
      antihypertensive drugs, and changes in blood pressure after commencing anti-VEGF treatment;&#xD;
      and 3) identify whether specific antihypertensive drugs and drug combinations, prescribed&#xD;
      either before or after commencing anti-VEGF treatment, lead to a better blood pressure&#xD;
      control and prevent proteinuria during anti-VEGF treatment. Specific statistical analyses&#xD;
      will be conducted to assess and identify associations and will account for other patient's&#xD;
      characteristics and repeated observations over time. The investigators plan to conduct this&#xD;
      study over 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Studies VEG108844 and VEG105192 have been selected as they investigate the same anti-VEGF&#xD;
      drug, pazopanib, in a homogeneous group, i.e. patients with renal cancer. At the same time,&#xD;
      inclusion of a placebo arm as well as a treatment arm with a different anti-VEGF drug,&#xD;
      sunitimib, will allow initial comparisons across different groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The results deriving from this study will provide important knowledge on 1) patterns of blood&#xD;
      pressure changes with anti-VEGF drugs and 2) whether specific antihypertensive drugs or drug&#xD;
      classes might be better than others in preventing and managing anti-VEGF induced hypertension&#xD;
      and proteinuria.&#xD;

      Background: High blood pressure is a common complication observed in cancer patients&#xD;
      prescribed a class of medications known as anti-VEGF drugs. Increased blood pressure, also&#xD;
      known as hypertension, increases the risk of heart attacks and strokes, thus adversely&#xD;
      affecting survival and quality of life in this patient group. However, little is known about&#xD;
      the mechanisms leading to high blood pressure with anti-VEGF drugs. As a result, the&#xD;
      management of anti-VEGF drug-induced hypertension is largely empirical, hence sub-optimal. A&#xD;
      better knowledge of effects of specific blood pressure lowering drugs, i.e.&#xD;
      antihypertensives, on anti-VEGF drug-induced hypertension would optimize therapeutic&#xD;
      management and reduce the risk associated with hypertension and proteinuria in patients with&#xD;
      cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: The investigators will access the datasets of two GSK clinical trials using the&#xD;
      anti-VEGF drug pazopanib, i.e. VEG108844 and VEG105192, in order to 1) determine the way&#xD;
      blood pressure changes over time after commencing anti-VEGF treatment; 2) identify whether&#xD;
      there are any relationships between pre-study and baseline blood pressure values, treatment&#xD;
      with specific antihypertensive drugs, and changes in blood pressure after commencing&#xD;
      anti-VEGF treatment; and 3) identify whether specific antihypertensive drugs and drug&#xD;
      combinations, prescribed either before or after commencing anti-VEGF treatment, lead to a&#xD;
      better blood pressure control and prevent proteinuria during anti-VEGF treatment. Specific&#xD;
      statistical analyses will be conducted to assess and identify associations and will account&#xD;
      for other patient's characteristics and repeated observations over time. The investigators&#xD;
      plan to conduct this study over 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Studies VEG108844 and VEG105192 have been selected as they investigate the same anti-VEGF&#xD;
      drug, pazopanib, in a homogeneous group, i.e. patients with renal cancer. At the same time,&#xD;

      pressure changes with anti-VEGF drugs and 2) whether specific antihypertensive drugs or drug&#xD;
      classes might be better than others in preventing and managing anti-VEGF induced hypertension&#xD;
      and proteinuria. This research will pave the way for further clinical studies aimed at&#xD;
      testing the hypotheses generated. The evidence generated could contribute to the development&#xD;
      of national and international guidelines for the management of anti-VEGF induced&#xD;
      hypertension.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators plan to disseminate the findings at national and international oncology&#xD;
      and/or hypertension conferences and by publishing the results in peer-reviewed scientific&#xD;
      journals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design&#xD;
&#xD;
      The selected studies, VEG105192 and VEG108844, have been designed to investigate the efficacy&#xD;
      of the anti-VEGF drug pazopanib vs. placebo (randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled&#xD;
      study, VEG105192) and vs. another anti-VEGF drug (sunitimib, randomised, open-label, parallel&#xD;
      group study, VEG108844) in two renal cancer patient populations. Both studies provide data on&#xD;
      repeated blood pressure measurements (systolic, diastolic and pulse pressure), medications&#xD;
      (including anti-hypertensive medications) and dose changes as well as a number of clinical,&#xD;
      demographic and biochemical characteristics. This information is essential to conduct&#xD;
      analysis of associations between these variables.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Studies Selected and Study Populations&#xD;
&#xD;
      The studies VEG105192 and VEG108844 have been selected because they compare the chosen&#xD;
      VEGF-inhibitor (pazopanib) vs. either a placebo or another VEGF-inhibitor (sunimitib) in&#xD;
      similar study groups, i.e. patients with renal cancer. Moreover, both studies provide&#xD;
      repeated measures of blood pressure and data on medications and dose changes. Considering&#xD;
      both studies will allow: 1) characterising blood pressure temporal changes in patients&#xD;
      receiving different anti-VEGF drugs vs. placebo; and 2) assessing whether the blood pressure&#xD;
      lowering effects of antihypertensive drugs are similar in patients receiving pazopanib vs.&#xD;
      sunitimib.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary and Secondary Endpoints for the Study&#xD;
&#xD;
      There will be four primary aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To assess which anti-hypertensive drug class is most effective for the treatment of&#xD;
           hypertension induced by anti-VEGF drugs (pazopanib and sunitinib).&#xD;
&#xD;
           As the mechanism seems primarily nitric oxide (NO) mediated, with possible additional&#xD;
           involvement of the renin-angiotensin system, the investigators hypothesise that drugs&#xD;
           with salutary effects on endothelial function (angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor&#xD;
           [ACEI], angiotensin II receptor blocker [ARB] and calcium channel blocker [CCB] based&#xD;
           treatment regimens) are more likely to be effective than traditional thiazide diuretics,&#xD;
           beta-blockers or other vasodilators&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To assess whether use of specific anti-hypertensive drugs prior to starting an anti-VEGF&#xD;
           drug may reduce the risk of anti-VEGF drug mediated hypertension.&#xD;
&#xD;
           As the mechanism seems primarily NO-mediated, with possible additional involvement of&#xD;
           the renin-angiotensin system, the investigators hypothesise that drugs with salutary&#xD;
           effects on endothelial function (ACEI, ARB and CCB-based treatment regimens) may have a&#xD;
           preventative effect on VEGF inhibitor mediated hypertension.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To assess whether use of ACEI or ARB drugs prior to starting an anti-VEGF drug may&#xD;
           reduce the risk of anti-VEGF drug mediated proteinuria.&#xD;
&#xD;
           As ACEI and ARB drugs have been widely demonstrated to prevent or reduce proteinuria,&#xD;
           the investigators hypothesise that these drugs are more likely to be prevent anti-VEGF&#xD;
           drug mediated proteinuria than individuals using other anti-hypertensive drugs or no&#xD;
           anti-hypertensive drugs.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To assess whether use of ACEI or ARB drugs is prognostic for improved survival in renal&#xD;
           cell carcinoma with anti-VEGF drug use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a confirmatory study based on findings from a recent pooled analysis of renal cancer&#xD;
      trials which found that users of ACEI or ARB had improved overall and progression free&#xD;
      survival [J Clin Oncol 32, 2014 (suppl 4; abstr 437)].&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators further aim to undertake exploratory analyses to provide greater insight of&#xD;
      anti-VEGF drug mediated hypertension and proteinuria and raise hypotheses for confirmation in&#xD;
      subsequent studies, e.g. time frame, form and extent of BP changes, BP changes leading to&#xD;
      initiation of anti-hypertensives, distribution of anti-hypertensive strategies utilized, and&#xD;
      time-frame, form and extent of BP reductions. Baseline covariates influencing the risk of&#xD;
      hypertension and proteinuria as well as predicting the extent of BP reduction with&#xD;
      antihypertensive therapy.&#xD;
