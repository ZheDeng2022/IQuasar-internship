      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - People with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) often have problems with&#xD;
      motivation and rewards. . Omega-3 fats have helped symptoms of ADHD improve in children.&#xD;
      Researchers want to learn more about the brain activity of people with ADHD and see how&#xD;
      taking omega-3 fats might help.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To learn more about how omega-3 fats affect brain activity and ADHD symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Adults age 18 55 with ADHD symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be screened with medical history and review of medical records.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  For study visit 1, participants will have a medical examination and be interviewed to&#xD;
           confirm they have ADHD. They will have an IQ test and give blood and urine samples.&#xD;
           Height, weight, and blood pressure will be measured. They will also need to sign consent&#xD;
           to agree to take part in the study. They will be asked to complete a food diary for 4&#xD;
           days&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  For visit 2, participants will give a blood sample. They will complete questionnaires&#xD;
           about their mood and ADHD symptoms.. They may give a blood or saliva sample for genetic&#xD;
           testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will have a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan. They will lie on a table&#xD;
           that slides in and out of a metal cylinder. It makes loud noises; participants will get&#xD;
           earplugs. This scan examines the structure of the brain.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will have a functional MRI scan. This scan measures the function of the&#xD;
           brain while the volunteer is performing tasks in the scanner. They will stop ADHD&#xD;
           medications 48 hours before this scan.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will receive key-lime flavored omega-3 smoothie mix or placebo to takeevery&#xD;
           day&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  For visit 3, participants will give blood samples and complete questionnaires.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  For visit 4, participants will be weighed and have a blood test and MRI scans as per&#xD;
           before. They will repeat the questionnaires and will guess whether they received the&#xD;
           omega-3 or placebo.&#xD;

      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and addictive behaviors have been&#xD;
      persistently related to impaired reward-related processes in the ventral striatum as&#xD;
      evidenced by functional magnetic resonance imaging studies (fMRI). These impairments&#xD;
      characterized by decreased BOLD activation are thought to be linked to dopamine pathways&#xD;
      including decreased D2 receptor function. Omega-3 highly unsaturated fatty acids (HUFAs) are&#xD;
      critical for cell-signaling among other complex functions throughout the central nervous&#xD;
      system. Animal models have demonstrated that depriving animals of the omega-3 DHA in utero&#xD;
      significantly decreases the density of ventral striatal D2- like receptors and furthermore&#xD;
      depletes dopamine in the nucleus acumens by 40-60%. The behavioral profile of animals&#xD;
      subjected to dietary induced deficiencies of omega-3 reflect decreased goal-directed behavior&#xD;
      and increased goal-irrelevant activity, hyperactivity, increased anxiety and reduced behavior&#xD;
      flexibility. Abnormally low levels of omega-3 HUFAs have been persistently reported in the&#xD;
      erythrocytes of both children and adults with ADHD while supplementation with omega-3 HUFAs&#xD;
      was found in a meta-analysis of 10 clinical trials to improve symptoms of ADHD. However, to&#xD;
      date no one has tested the potential mediating effects of omega-3 supplementation in&#xD;
      reward-related processes in adults with ADHD using neuroimaging techniques. There is hence a&#xD;
      need to research the potential treatment effects of omega-3 on assessments of brain function.&#xD;
      Therefore, the primary objective of this study is to test the effects of omega-3 intervention&#xD;
      (compared to a placebo) in increasing ventral striatal activation during the monetary&#xD;
      incentive delay (MID) task. Secondary objectives include collecting neuroimaging data and&#xD;
      standardized questionnaires measuring, mood, quality of life and symptoms of ADHD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population:&#xD;
&#xD;
      150 adults, other-wise healthy, aged 18-55 with ADHD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The active group will be stratified according to age and sex to either an active intervention&#xD;
      group receiving (1) 3000 mg of omega-3 HUFA smoothie or a placebo group (2) 3000 mg of&#xD;
      smoothie macadamia nut oil for 16 weeks. After enrollment and baseline testing, active&#xD;
      participants will be randomized to either the treatment or placebo group and instructed to&#xD;
      begin consumption of assigned emulsions. Randomized participants will be assessed at&#xD;
      baseline, 1 month, 8 weeks, and 16 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome Measures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome assessments will measure ventral-striatum activation during the MID task.&#xD;
      Secondary objectives include: structural MRI, symptoms of ADHD using the Conner s Adult ADHD&#xD;
      Rating Scales; negative affective symptoms; endocannabinoid levels and weight change.&#xD;
