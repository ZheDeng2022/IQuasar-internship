      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - People with sickle cell disease and other blood disorders sometimes get chronic leg ulcers.&#xD;
      These are wounds that develop on the skin and don t go away. Current treatments do not work&#xD;
      very well, so researchers want to learn more about why the ulcers happen. They want to find&#xD;
      out which bacteria may cause it, and if external factors play a role.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To study social and environmental factors of sickle cell disease and the causes of sickle&#xD;
      cell disease leg ulcers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - People age 18 and older who have sickle cell disease or another red cell disorder, with or&#xD;
      without an active leg ulcer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will have a medical history and clinical evaluation. They will also have&#xD;
           blood drawn.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will complete questionnaires about their life, health, environment, stress,&#xD;
           and other topics.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants may provide a small sample of hair.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be asked to collect a small amount of saliva.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants with leg ulcers will have their skin microbiome sampled. The microbiome is&#xD;
           all of the microbes (bacteria and and/or fungi) and their genes in and on the body.&#xD;
           Researchers will use swabs to collect skin samples. Photographs will be taken of the&#xD;
           skin sample area.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Some participants without leg ulcers also will have their skin microbiome sampled.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Some participants who have their skin microbiome sampled will return for a second visit.&#xD;
           At this visit, their microbiome will be resampled. It will take place more than 30 days&#xD;
           after the first visit.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Leg ulcers are a serious and debilitating complication of sickle cell disease (SCD). This&#xD;
      study will explore microbial, genomic, and environmental (social and physical) factors, that&#xD;
      may influence the onset and progression of leg ulcer formation and delayed healing in&#xD;
      individuals living with SCD. There is variation in the incidence and duration of SCD leg&#xD;
      ulcers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      They are often very painful, resistant to treatment, and recurrent in nature. The etiology of&#xD;
      SCD associated leg ulcers is unclear, and we hypothesize that predisposition to developing&#xD;
      leg ulcers is multifactorial. This multisite study is an exploratory study of the microbiome&#xD;
      and environment of individuals living with sickle cell disease leg ulcers. The study's&#xD;
      objective is to identify triggers that may be integral in leg ulcer onset and progression.&#xD;
      The central goal of this study is to obtain an improved understanding of the participants&#xD;
      clinical phenotype, leg ulcer microbiome and the psychosocial and environmental factors that&#xD;
      may impact this complication. To achieve these goals, we will: (1) characterize the leg skin&#xD;
      microbiome of SCD participants living with and without leg ulcers within the United States&#xD;
      and Sierra Leone; (2) collect and analyze psychosocial and physical environmental data of&#xD;
      individuals with SCD without leg ulcers and with leg ulcers; (3) examine the psychosocial&#xD;
      impact of leg ulcers on individuals with SCD by conducting a qualitative phase to explore the&#xD;
      individual experiences to understand the physical function, stigma, and self-esteem&#xD;
      associated with those with active, recurrent, or single-occurrence presentations of leg&#xD;
      ulcers; and (4) explore what factors influence psychological resilience, to examine the&#xD;
      relationship of psychological resilience to the health outcomes of an adult population living&#xD;
      with sickle cell disease in the U.S. and in Sierra Leone. This will provide us the&#xD;
      opportunity to understand the complexity of participants' health, health care experiences and&#xD;
      quality of life.&#xD;

        This is a descriptive study of individuals living with sickle cell diseases (SCD) with and&#xD;
        without leg ulcers (accrual goal 550 participants). Leg ulcers are not observed in all&#xD;
        individuals with SCD and we are interested in understanding why certain individuals develop&#xD;
        leg ulcers. We will seek to include age-matched patients without leg ulcers for the&#xD;
        microbiome phase of the study. We will recruit and sample male or female adult participants&#xD;
        with ulcers, currently without leg ulcers, and those with no previous history of leg&#xD;
        ulcers. To ensure we recruit an adequate number of participants with and without leg&#xD;
        ulcers, we will rely on multiple recruiting methods, which will include posting flyers,&#xD;
        social media advertisements, and/or referrals.&#xD;
