  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to see whether an altered schedule of giving erlotinib in&#xD;
      combination with gemcitabine will be safe and might improve the results of the treatment for&#xD;
      advanced cancer of the pancreas.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Gemcitabine and erlotinib are commercially available. Gemcitabine is FDA approved as&#xD;
      first-line treatment for patients with locally advanced, unresectable or metastatic cancer of&#xD;
      the pancreas. Erlotinib is FDA approved in combination with gemcitabine for the first-line&#xD;
      treatment of patients with locally advanced, unresectable or metastatic pancreatic cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The FDA recommended dose for erlotinib is 100 mg daily. This study will investigate the&#xD;
      experimental administration of higher doses of erlotinib given for only three days twice a&#xD;
      month, a schedule called &quot;pulse dosing&quot;.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Survival of pancreatic cancer patients remains poor, and treatment with erlotinib remains one&#xD;
      of the few agents that have demonstrated increased survival. Alternative dosing schedules for&#xD;
      erlotinib should be explored since chronic low dose therapy fails to achieve therapeutically&#xD;
      effective concentrations for many patients and leads to increased skin toxicity and may&#xD;
      induce acquired resistance without significantly impacting the tumor. Therefore, higher doses&#xD;
      given for shorter periods of exposure, similar to the dosing of most chemotherapeutic agents,&#xD;
      may achieve more effective therapeutic doses of than chronic low dose therapy and may&#xD;
      minimize skin toxicity observed with erlotinib.&#xD;
&#xD;
      No phase I studies have been done with the combination of high dose pulse erlotinib therapy&#xD;
      with gemcitabine. We propose a phase I dose escalation study of three day oral dosing of&#xD;
      erlotinib with standard dose (1000 mg/m2) gemcitabine. The starting dose of erlotinib is 750&#xD;
      mg, approximately 50% of the the dose found to be safe in previous combination studies with&#xD;
      carboplatin and paclitaxel and with pemetrexed [Riely et al. 2009, Davies et al. 2009]. Since&#xD;
      acquired resistance can occur rapidly and 5 to 7 days of treatment is not better than 3 days&#xD;
      of treatment, we will focus on a 3 day high-dose pulse treatment given every 14 days. This&#xD;
      will provide 11 days between erlotinib dosing for the recovery of normal tissues. Levels of&#xD;
      serum erlotinib will also be monitored due to considerable interpatient variability in the&#xD;
      metabolism of erlotinib.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypotheses of this study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  High-dose pulse therapy with erlotinib can be safely administered with standard dose&#xD;
           gemcitabine.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  High-dose pulse therapy with erlotinib will permit recovery of the epidermis between&#xD;
           treatments resulting in reduced skin toxicity compared to chronic daily dosing.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Disease control with high-dose pulse therapy may be superior to that with chronic low&#xD;
           dose therapy.&#xD;
