  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators' hypothesis is that a plant-based diet may be beneficial if nutritional&#xD;
      deficiencies will be corrected. The aims of the present proposal are to 1) study endothelial&#xD;
      functions of subjects on well-defined vegetarian/vegan diets compared to age and sex matched&#xD;
      omnivores (controls), and 2) study the differences in energy expenditure, body composition,&#xD;
      overnight substrate utilization, blood work results, and levels of intracellular reactive&#xD;
      oxygen species (ROS) and of adhesion molecules on the different diets.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The serious doubts about the nutritional adequacy of vegetarian diets in the past were&#xD;
      essentially put to rest by recent studies that suggested that plant-based diets are healthy&#xD;
      and associated with lower risk of several chronic diseases. Nevertheless, various nutritional&#xD;
      deficiencies have been identified, and it has been shown that individuals who follow&#xD;
      different types of vegetarian/vegan diets may not experience the same effects on their&#xD;
      health.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Working Hypothesis&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Vegetarian/vegan diets will promote protection against cardiovascular risk factors if&#xD;
           supplemented with possibly deficient nutrients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. There will a further protective effect and a greater number of differences between&#xD;
           subjects following a vegetarian diet compared to those following a vegan diet.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Higher energy expenditure and lower and different caloric intake will promote a&#xD;
           favorable difference in body composition (lower body fat) via a different substrate&#xD;
           utilization expressed in the measured respiratory quotient (RQ).&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Extra- and intracellular free radicals will be higher in subjects who adhere to&#xD;
           vegetarian/vegan diets compared to omnivores.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aims of the study&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To study the effect of vegetarian/vegan diets on endothelial functions after correcting&#xD;
           for modifying factors.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To study the effect of the above-mentioned plant-based diets on carotid intima-media&#xD;
           thickness.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To study the differences in body composition, resting energy expenditure and over-night&#xD;
           substrate utilization between the different diets.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To study the intracellular ROS of subjects following different diets.&#xD;

    <description>The endo peripheral arterial tonometry (PAT) provides an index of endothelial function in two forms:&#xD;
The reactive hyperemia index (RHI) is the post-to-preocclusion PAT signal ratio in the occluded side, normalized to the control side and further corrected for baseline vascular tone.&#xD;
The logarithm RHI (LnRHI) is s similar index as RHI after natural log transformation with a matched cutoff. LnRHI provides better double-sided distribution than RHI and one that is closer to normal distribution</description>

    <description>cIMT is the distance between the intimal-luminal interface and the medial-adventitial interface. It will be studied by B-mode ultrasonography of the extracranial carotid arteries. A duplex system with a 7-10 megahertz (MHz) linear array multi-frequency transducer will be used.</description>
