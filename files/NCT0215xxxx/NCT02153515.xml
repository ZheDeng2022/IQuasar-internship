      To investigate if fresh finger prick autologous blood (FAB) instead of serum from&#xD;
      venesection, is a safe and effective treatment for dry eyes and corneal ulcers/ epithelial&#xD;
      defects. Currently there are no studies on the use of whole fresh blood for the treatment of&#xD;
      chronic ulcers, persistent epithelial defects or dry eyes. Unpublished case reports indicate&#xD;
      that fresh blood can be an effective tool to the treatment of corneal pathology.&#xD;

      Background Autologous serum is used for chronic ulcers and dry eyes. Currently there are no&#xD;
      studies on the use of whole fresh blood for the treatment of chronic ulcers, persistent&#xD;
      epithelial defects or dry eyes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dry eye syndrome (DES) refers to a common but highly heterogeneous group of ocular surface&#xD;
      disorders with varying disease severity, due to lack of sufficient tears or sufficient&#xD;
      quality of tears. Corneal and conjunctival studies, using a variety of definitions, have&#xD;
      estimated the prevalence of ''significant'' DES to be about 10-20% in the adult population,&#xD;
      although fortunately severe DES is less frequent (Hikichi et al., 1995; Bjerrum, 1997;&#xD;
      Doughty et al., 1997; Bandeen-Roche et al., 1997; Caffery et al., 1998; McCarty et al., 1998;&#xD;
      Schein et al., 1999; Moss et al., 2000; Begley et al., 2002; Chia et al., 2003; Lin et al.,&#xD;
      2003; Schaumberg et al., 2003).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dry eye is usually managed with conventional treatment of artificial tears, punctual plugs,&#xD;
      occlusive goggles and bandage contact lenses. In spite of maximal conventional therapy, there&#xD;
      is a cohort of patients who have persistent symptoms and signs. This represents a more&#xD;
      serious ocular surface disorder with patients having significant visual impairment and&#xD;
      disability. Particularly severe dry eye might be managed with contact lenses, botulinum toxin&#xD;
      induced ptosis and surgical tarsorrhapy. These treatments are not without their own hazards&#xD;
      such as infection from contact lenses, reduced vision from the ptosis or surgical&#xD;
      tarsorrhapy, particularly in only seeing eyes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Corneal ulcers are usually managed with artificial tears, antibiotic ointment, bandage&#xD;
      contact lenses and steroids.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Autologous serum eye drops have been found in uncontrolled trials to be beneficial in these&#xD;
      patients, improving the ocular surface and reducing symptoms (Poon et al., 2001; Fox et al.,&#xD;
      1984; Tsubota et all, 1999;). In addition, impression cytology and in vitro toxicity testing&#xD;
      demonstrated that serum drops have reduced toxicity compared with unpreserved&#xD;
      hydroxypropylmethylcellulose (Noble et al., 2004; Poon et al., 2001)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Obtaining serum requires frequent venesection with significant amount of blood taken. It is&#xD;
      also expensive. The serum is aliquoted into hundreds of bottles with the additional risk of&#xD;
      bacterial contamination. It also requires a fridge and storage facilities for these aliquoted&#xD;
      bottles at the patient's home. Because of these requirements some patients are excluded, for&#xD;
      example patients with anaemia because they are unable to give blood. In addition, often there&#xD;
      is a delay in starting the treatment for organizational and / or funding reasons that can be&#xD;
      detrimental to the course of the disease, causing unnecessary surgery and corneal melt&#xD;
      resulting in perforation with potential loss of the eye. The FAB method could be used&#xD;
      immediately for patients who are awaiting conventional treatment for autologous blood.&#xD;
      Furthermore it also appears that 100% autologous serum is more beneficial than 50% serum&#xD;
      (Poon et al), thereby larger volumes of blood and/or more frequent venesection is required.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Autologous fresh blood is already used subconjunctivally to help heal leaking trabeculectomy&#xD;
      blebs (Dinah et al.2010; Biswas et al. 2009; Burnstein et al. 2001; Haynes et al., 1999).&#xD;
      Autologous blood is also used to help attach limbal autografts in cases of pterygium (de Wit&#xD;
      et al. 2010) and in vitreoretinal macular hole surgery (Lai et al. 2009; Chuang et al. 2010;&#xD;
      McCannel et al. 2008; Lai et al.,2005). No adverse effects have been reported in these&#xD;
      studies. The object of this study is to investigate if serum via a drop of fresh blood is an&#xD;
      effective treatment for dry eye and corneal ulcers which currently require venesected&#xD;
      autologous blood and would be particularly useful in the current group of patients in whom&#xD;
      venesection is contraindicated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If shown to be effective this may replace current autologous serum practice and its ease of&#xD;
      use and reduced cost may mean that it could be extended to other ocular surface diseases or&#xD;
      moderate dry eyes and used earlier in corneal epithelial defects.&#xD;
