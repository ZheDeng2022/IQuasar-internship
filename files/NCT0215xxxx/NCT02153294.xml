      The purpose of this national multicentre randomized controlled trial is to compare a&#xD;
      ventilation strategy using lower tidal volumes and higher respiratory rates with a&#xD;
      ventilation strategy using higher tidal volumes and a lower respiratory rate in intubated and&#xD;
      ventilated intensive care unit (ICU) patients without Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome&#xD;
      (ARDS) at start of ventilation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participating centres in The Netherlands will include a total of 952 adult patients admitted&#xD;
      to intensive care units without ARDS. Patients are randomized and ventilated with either a&#xD;
      strategy with lower tidal volumes (4 to 6 ml/kg predicted body weight (PBW)) or a strategy&#xD;
      with higher tidal volumes (8 to 10 ml/kg PBW). Patients will be assessed every day until day&#xD;
      28 or discharge of the intensive care unit, whichever comes first, on day 28 and on day 90.&#xD;
      Primary endpoint is the number of ventilator-free days at day 28. Secondary endpoints are&#xD;
      ICU- and hospital length of stay (LOS) and - mortality, the incidence of development of ARDS,&#xD;
      pneumonia, atelectasis, and pneumothorax, the cumulative use and duration of sedatives, and&#xD;
      neuromuscular blocking agents, incidences of ICU delirium and ICU acquired weakness,&#xD;
      patient-ventilator asynchrony and the need for decreasing of instrumental dead space.&#xD;

      Research question:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Does mechanical ventilation with lower tidal volumes, as compared with mechanical ventilation&#xD;
      with higher tidal volumes, increase the number of ventilator-free days at day 28 in patients&#xD;
      without ARDS at start of ventilation?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      An investigator-initiated, national, multicenter, parallel randomized controlled two-arm&#xD;
      trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Centers:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Five centers in The Netherlands will participate in this trial;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Academic Medical Center, University of Amsterdam&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Gelre Hospitals, Apeldoorn&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Leiden University Medical Center, Leiden&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Tergooi, Hilversum&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Vrije Universiteit University Medical Center, Amsterdam&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Westfries Gasthuis, Hoorn&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethics Approval: The Institutional Review Board of the Academic Medical Center approved of&#xD;
      the study on 15 May 2014&#xD;
&#xD;
      Monitoring:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Monitoring of patients safety and reviewing of safety issues is performed by a&#xD;
           designated independent Data Safety and Monitoring Board (DSMB).The DSMB watches over the&#xD;
           ethics of conducting the study in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. This&#xD;
           study compares two treatment strategies that are used in standard care, therefore no&#xD;
           related serious adverse events (SAEs) are expected. All unexpected and related or&#xD;
           possibly related adverse events will be reported to the DSMB&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  An independent monitor will perform clinical trial monitoring. On-site monitoring will&#xD;
           comprise controlling presence and completeness of the research dossier and the informed&#xD;
           consent forms, source data checks will be performed. Every participating center will be&#xD;
           visited at least once every year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adult ICU-patients without ARDS with an expected duration of ventilation longer than 24&#xD;
      hours, within 1 hour after initiation of ventilation or admittance to the ICU if already&#xD;
      intubated and ventilated on admission.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample Size Calculation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The required sample size is calculated using data from the recently published meta-analysis&#xD;
      and a secondary analysis of this meta-analysis using individual patient data from the studies&#xD;
      performed in ICU patients [submitted for publication]. The sample size is computed on the&#xD;
      basis of the hypothesis that ventilation with lower tidal volumes is associated with a&#xD;
      reduction of one day of ventilation. A sample size of 397 patients in each group has 80%&#xD;
      statistical power to detect a difference of one ventilator-free day and alive at day 28 after&#xD;
      ICU admission, with means of 23 and 24 days respectively. Assuming that the common standard&#xD;
      deviation is 5 using a two group t-test with a 0.05 two-sided significance level. The sample&#xD;
      size is increased by 20% to correct for dropouts and lost to follow up (i.e., because&#xD;
      patients could be transferred to other hospitals), meaning that each group will contain 476&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients in participating intensive care units (ICU) are screened and randomized within 1&#xD;
      hour of start of mechanical ventilation in the unit. Demographic data on screened patients&#xD;
      regardless of meeting enrollment criteria will be recorded (registry: age, gender, type of&#xD;
      surgery). Randomization will be performed using a dedicated, password protected,&#xD;
      SSL-encrypted website. Randomization sequence is generated by a dedicated computer&#xD;
      randomization software program using random block sizes and is stratified per center and per&#xD;
      intubation location (i.e., in the ICU or before ICU admittance in the operation room or in&#xD;
      the emergency room). No blocking is applied to other trial factors. Due to the nature of the&#xD;
      intervention, blinding is not possible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients are randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to lower tidal volume ventilation (4 to 6 ml/kg&#xD;
      PBW) (the 'lower tidal volume'-arm) or ventilation with higher tidal volumes (8 to 10 ml/kg&#xD;
      PBW) (the 'higher tidal volume'-arm).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The allowed ventilation modes are volume controlled ventilation and pressure support&#xD;
      ventilation. The inspiration-to-expiration ratio with volume controlled ventilation is 1:2.&#xD;
      With volume controlled ventilation the inspiration time and pause are set at 25% and 10%&#xD;
      respectively. With pressure support ventilation the highest possible pressure rise is chosen,&#xD;
      and cycling off is set at 25%. The inspired oxygen fraction is 0.21 or higher to maintain&#xD;
      oxygen saturation 90 to 92% and/or PaO2 &gt; 7.3 to 10.7 kPa (55 to 80 mmHg). The respiratory&#xD;
      rate is adjusted to maintain a blood pH of 7.25 to 7.45. In case of metabolic acidosis or -&#xD;
      alkalosis, a lower or higher than normal PaCO2 can be accepted, left to the discretion of the&#xD;
      attending physician. The lowest level of positive end-expiratory pressure is 5 cmH2O.&#xD;
      Recruitment maneuvers are allowed, when deemed necessary, left to the discretion of the&#xD;
      attending physician. In both arms a tidal volume is titrated per PBW, which is calculated&#xD;
      according to a previously used formula: 50 + 0.91 x (centimeters of height - 152.4) for males&#xD;
      and 45.5 + 0.91 x (centimeters of height - 152.4) for females.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients randomized to the 'lower tidal volume'-arm start with a tidal volume of 6 ml/kg&#xD;
           PBW. The tidal volume size is decreased in steps of 1 ml/kg PBW per hour, to a minimum&#xD;
           of 4 ml/kg PBW, unless the patient suffers from severe dyspnea (identified by increased&#xD;
           respiratory rate &gt; 35 breaths per minute accompanied by increasing levels of discomfort&#xD;
           with or without need for more sedation) or unacceptable acidosis.The following measures&#xD;
           can be taken to prevent respiratory acidosis: increasing respiratory rate and decreasing&#xD;
           instrumental dead space by shortening ventilation tubing, to limit dead space&#xD;
           ventilation. Patients randomized to the lower tidal volume arm may need very little&#xD;
           support when the ventilator is switched to pressure support ventilation, but a minimum&#xD;
           of 5 cmH2O should be used. In case the resulting tidal volume exceeds 6 ml/kg PBW this&#xD;
           must be accepted&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients randomized to the 'higher tidal volume'-arm start with a tidal volume of 10&#xD;
           ml/kg PBW. With volume-controlled ventilation the plateau pressure should not exceed 25&#xD;
           cm H2O. Only if the plateau pressure exceeds 25 cm H2O the tidal volume is decreased in&#xD;
           steps of 1 ml/kg PBW per hour, to a minimum of 8 ml/kg PBW (table 1). With pressure&#xD;
           support, tidal volume titration is by variation of the pressure support level. Other&#xD;
           modes of ventilation are not allowed.Patients randomized to the higher tidal volume arm&#xD;
           generally need more support when the ventilator is switched to pressure support&#xD;
           ventilation, but the maximal airway pressure should not exceed 25 cm H2O [2]. In case&#xD;
           the resulting tidal volume remains below 10 ml/kg PBW this must be accepted.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Daily assessment of the ability to breathe with pressure support ventilation is required&#xD;
           as soon as FiO2 ≤ 0.4 or when the PEEP level and FiO2 level are lower than the day&#xD;
           before. Other modes of ventilation are not allowed.In addition, the ventilator can be&#xD;
           switched to pressure support ventilation at any moment the attending nurse or physician&#xD;
           consider the patient is awake enough to breathe with pressure support ventilation.&#xD;
           Assessment of the ability to breathe with pressure support is also required in case&#xD;
           patient-ventilator asynchrony is noticed (ineffective breathing; double triggering, use&#xD;
           of assessory respiratory muscles). A patient is assumed to be ready for extubation when&#xD;
           the following criteria are met for at least 30 minutes, the final decision for&#xD;
           extubation is made by the attending physician:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Responsive and cooperative&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Adequate cough reflex&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  PaO2/FiO2 of &gt; 200 mmHg with FiO2 ≤ 40%&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Respiratory rate of 8 to 30/minute&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  No signs of respiratory distress (i.e., marked accessory muscle use, abdominal&#xD;
                paradox, diaphoresis, marked dyspnea)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Pressure support level &lt; 7 cm H2O (lower tidal volume arm) or &lt; 12 cm H2O (higher&#xD;
                tidal volume arm)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Hemodynamically stable (systolic blood pressure 80 to 160 mmHg and heart rate 40 to&#xD;
                130/min) and no uncontrolled arrhythmia&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Temperature &gt; 36.0oC and &lt; 38.5oC In the higher tidal volume arm physicians and&#xD;
                nurses may decide to lower the pressure support level first (i.e., before&#xD;
                extubation). For this, the pressure support level is lowered step-wise with steps&#xD;
                of 2 to 5 cm H2O per hour to &lt; 7 cm H2O. If this is not tolerated according to the&#xD;
                conditions mentioned above, the pressure support level is set back to maintain a&#xD;
                tidal volume as per randomization and the patient is assessed for extubation the&#xD;
                following day. If a patient becomes able to breathe without assistance but&#xD;
                subsequently requires additional ventilation within 28 days after randomization,&#xD;
                the same tidal volume protocol is resumed. Non-invasive ventilation is allowed, but&#xD;
                it should be tried to have comparable tidal volumes as with invasive ventilation,&#xD;
                as per randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sedation follows the local guidelines for sedation in each participating units. In general,&#xD;
      these guidelines favor the use of analgo-sedation over hypno-sedation, use of bolus over&#xD;
      continuous infusion of sedating agents, and the use of sedation scores. Nurses determine the&#xD;
      level of sedation at least 3 times per day. The adequacy of sedation in each patient is&#xD;
      evaluated using a Richmond Agitation Sedation Scale (RASS). A RASS score of -2 to 0 is seen&#xD;
      as adequate sedation. As stated above, sedation adjustments should never be done to allow a&#xD;
      lower or higher tidal volume. The goals of sedation are to reduce agitation, stress and fear;&#xD;
      to reduce oxygen consumption (heart rate, blood pressure and minute volume are measured&#xD;
      continuously); and to reduce physical resistance to- and fear of daily care and medical&#xD;
      examination. Patient comfort is the primary goal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The primary outcome, the number of ventilator-free days at day 28 after ICU admission,&#xD;
           is analyzed using Cox's regression. Possible imbalance between groups will be modeled in&#xD;
           the Cox model. P-values of 0.05 are used for statistical significance. When appropriate,&#xD;
           statistical uncertainty will be expressed by the 95% confidence levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Continuous normally distributed variables will be expressed by their mean and standard&#xD;
           deviation or when not normally distributed as medians and their interquartile ranges.&#xD;
           Categorical variables will be expressed as n (%). To test groups Student's t test will&#xD;
           be used, if continuous data is not normally distributed the Mann-Whitney U test will be&#xD;
           used. Categorical variables will be compared with the Chi-square test or Fisher's exact&#xD;
           tests. Time dependent data will be analyzed using a proportional hazard model adjusted&#xD;
           for possible imbalances of patients' baseline characteristics. Patient characteristics&#xD;
           will be compared and described by appropriate statistics.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The goal of the primary analysis is to quantify the effect of lower tidal volumes vs.&#xD;
           higher tidal volumes on the number of ventilator free days and alive at day 28.&#xD;
           Statistical analysis will be based on the intention-to-treat principle. We will also&#xD;
           perform a per-protocol analysis, comparing patients who received lower tidal volumes and&#xD;
           patients who received higher tidal volumes. Other secondary analyses include analysis of&#xD;
           patients who had pneumonia versus patients without pneumonia, patients who fulfilled the&#xD;
           definition for mild ARDS versus patients who did not fulfill this definition, and&#xD;
           patients with sepsis versus patients without sepsis.&#xD;
