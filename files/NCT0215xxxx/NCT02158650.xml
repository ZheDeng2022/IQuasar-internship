  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if presenting treatment options to basal cell&#xD;
      carcinoma patients in video format will improve efficiency and allow patients to receive&#xD;
      consistent, comprehensive, visually-depicted treatment option information to improve patient&#xD;
      quality of care. Patients can learn more about treatment options as they are depicted&#xD;
      visually so as to better assist them in understanding treatment risks and benefits to&#xD;
      confidently make a well-informed decision. Primarily, the study will evaluate efficiency when&#xD;
      using the education video medium. The study will also evaluate the effectiveness of the video&#xD;
      medium as an aid to decision making in addition to standard of care in comparison to the&#xD;
      standard of care alone. Additionally, the study will evaluate both patients' and&#xD;
      dermatologists' satisfaction of the educational intervention.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Currently, verbal consultation is the widespread practice in presenting treatment options for&#xD;
      basal cell carcinoma patients. This method, although personable and direct, is often&#xD;
      incomplete and subject to variability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Emory Department of Dermatology has created an educational video involving treatment&#xD;
      options for patients with newly diagnosed basal cell carcinoma as part of routine clinical&#xD;
      care. The purpose of this study is to determine the effectiveness of the video format in&#xD;
      improving efficiency and workflow. Many studies have shown that multimedia tools improve&#xD;
      patient education and have been more efficient than in-office verbal discussions alone. In&#xD;
      addition, educational videos have been documented to increase patient satisfaction as well as&#xD;
      decrease patient stress level and anxiety. Other advantages of educational videos are for the&#xD;
      repetition and reinforcement that would benefit the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Moreover, with the utilization of video, patients will receive the same comprehensive&#xD;
      information, making the delivery reproducible and controlled. With verbal communication,&#xD;
      there is usually no standardized interaction between staff and patients to ensure that the&#xD;
      patient is receiving all pertinent information regarding their options. For example, a study&#xD;
      designed to examine retention rates for verbal and written instructions, including 10&#xD;
      potential complications, in patients undergoing Mohs micrographic surgery showed an overall&#xD;
      poor retention rate of only 26.5% just 20 minutes after being informed. It is obvious then&#xD;
      that educational protocols need additional modalities in order to improve overall retention&#xD;
      rates. This then suggests that information presented in video format increases knowledge&#xD;
      retention in patients, even weeks after initial delivery of information.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study participants will be randomly assigned to the control (Group I) - or video- (Group II)&#xD;
      group. Participants will be randomized by clinic. Patients randomized to Group II will&#xD;
      complete a pre-video knowledge assessment followed by viewing of the BCC educational video.&#xD;
      Patients will complete a post-video knowledge assessment following video viewing. Group II&#xD;
      patients will then undergo discussion of treatment options with their physician as per&#xD;
      standard of care. After the treatment discussion, Group II patients will complete an&#xD;
      additional knowledge assessment. After the treatment visit is complete, patients will&#xD;
      complete a satisfaction survey. Patients randomized to Group I will not view the educational&#xD;
      video. Group I patients will complete a pre-knowledge assessment before their standard of&#xD;
      care discussion of treatment options with their physician. Similar to Group II, patients in&#xD;
      Group I complete an additional knowledge assessment after the treatment discussion and a&#xD;
      satisfaction survey at the conclusion of the treatment visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If there is failure of completion of a satisfaction survey in the dermatology clinic,&#xD;
      patients (group I and group II) may be contacted via phone to complete the survey.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physicians will be recruited to complete a satisfaction survey at the end of the day only if&#xD;
      they provided treatment to a Group II patient (patients who viewed the video).&#xD;
