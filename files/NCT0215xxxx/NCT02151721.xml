  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      -  Gefitinib is an orally active epidermal growth factor receptor-tyrosine kinase inhibitor&#xD;
           (EGFR-TKI). However, 20-30% of patients with EGFR-activating mutations show intrinsic&#xD;
           resistance to EGFR-TKI.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  EGFR-mutant non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells with BIM (BCL2L11) deletion&#xD;
           polymorphism show the impaired generation of BIM with the proapoptotic BH3 domain, as&#xD;
           well as resistance to EGFR-TKI-induced apoptosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Both BIM polymorphism (12.9%) and EGFR mutations (50% in lung adenocarcinoma) are more&#xD;
           prevalent in the East Asian than in Caucasian populations. BIM is a BH3-only&#xD;
           proapoptotic member of the Bcl-2 protein family. BIM upregulation is required for&#xD;
           apoptosis induction by EGFR-TKI in EGFR-mutant NSCLC.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Vorinostat (suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid [SAHA]) is a small-molecule inhibitor of&#xD;
           histone deacetylase (HDAC) and induces cell differentiation, cell cycle arrest, and&#xD;
           apoptosis in several tumor cells. HDAC inhibition can epigenetically restore BIM&#xD;
           function and death sensitivity of EGFR-TKI in patients with EGFR-mutant NSCLC in whom&#xD;
           resistance to EGFR-TKI is associated with a common BIM polymorphism. EGFR-TKI resistance&#xD;
           due to the BIM polymorphism may be able to be circumvented in combination with HDAC&#xD;
           inhibition of vorinostat with gefitinib in NSCLC.&#xD;

      -  A cohort of three patients will be treated at each dose level for one cycle (28 days per&#xD;
           cycle).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Treatment will be continued if no DLTs are recorded, and three patients will be treated&#xD;
           at the next higher dose level.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If a patient of the cohort develops a DLT, however, another cohort of three patients&#xD;
           will be treated for 1 cycle.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If more DLTs do not develop, dose escalation continues.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If more than one of three patients develop a DLT at any dose level, another cohort of&#xD;
           three patients will be treated at the next lower dose level.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If no DLTs are recorded in any of the cohorts, the number of patients per cohort will be&#xD;
           increased from 3 to 6.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Up to 12 patients will be enrolled at the MTD.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Therefore, the phase II dose for this combined therapy will be defined as the highest&#xD;
           dose level at which six patients were treated and less than three DLTs developed.&#xD;
