      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) is the virus that causes AIDS. HIV can hide in the blood&#xD;
      for many years, even in people who have their HIV infection under control. HIV that is hiding&#xD;
      in the blood is called the latent HIV reservoir. Researchers want to find out more about it&#xD;
      in this study. This knowledge may help them develop new ways to prevent or control HIV. This&#xD;
      study will draw its participants from the Rakai Health Sciences Program in rural southwestern&#xD;
      Uganda.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To measure and learn about the latent HIV reservoir in Ugandans with HIV.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Men and women at least 18 years of age with HIV.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will have a medical history and physical exam. Their medical records will&#xD;
           be reviewed. Researchers will ask participants about their health and recent illnesses.&#xD;
           Participants able to get pregnant will have their urine tested for pregnancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will have their finger pricked to see if they have enough red blood cells&#xD;
           to be eligible for the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If eligible, participants will have blood drawn through a needle in the arm. Their blood&#xD;
           will also be tested for other diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  After the blood draw, participants will be asked to stay seated or lying down if they&#xD;
           are not feeling well for up to 30 minutes.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The vast majority of HIV-infected individuals currently live in sub-Saharan Africa where&#xD;
      fully suppressive ART is expanding rapidly. Due to this expansion, a large number of Africans&#xD;
      will be eligible candidates for cure treatment when one comes available. However, strategies&#xD;
      needed to establish a functional cure may differ in African populations due to differences in&#xD;
      endemic infectious disease load and in cellular immune activation among Africans as compared&#xD;
      to Western populations. To date, there have been no systematic studies to quantify the latent&#xD;
      reservoir in HIV-infected Africans. This is a cross-sectional, descriptive study to measure&#xD;
      the size of the latent HIV reservoir in virally suppressed HIV-infected individuals residing&#xD;
      in Uganda and to examine the immunological and virologic correlates of the latent reservoir.&#xD;
      The study will draw its participants from a National Institutes of Health (NIH) International&#xD;
      Center for Excellence in Research (ICER) site, located at the Rakai Health Sciences Program&#xD;
      (RHSP) in rural southwestern Uganda. One group of subjects will be comprised of 70&#xD;
      HIV-infected patients who are on ART with suppressed viral loads &lt; 40 copies per ml over a&#xD;
      period of 10-18 months. A second group will be comprised of 10 HIV-infected subjects with&#xD;
      suppressed viral load &lt; 40 copies per ml over a period of 10-18 months and not on&#xD;
      antiretroviral drugs (elite suppressors). Study participation will require only one visit&#xD;
      with a fingerstick hemoglobin screening and a blood draw. Plasma and cells from the blood&#xD;
      will be separated and processed for quantitative viral latency, circulating cytokine and&#xD;
      chemokine analysis, co-culture, and flow cytometric and serologic assays for selected&#xD;
      immunological parameters. Viral latency results will be interpreted in relation to values&#xD;
      previously collected from HIV-infected individuals in the United States.&#xD;

        The study will draw its participants from an NIH International Center for Excellence in&#xD;
        Research (ICER) site, located at the Rakai Health Sciences Program (RHSP) in rural&#xD;
        southwestern Uganda. Since 1994, over 12,000 adults aged 15-49 years of age have been under&#xD;
        annual surveillance in an open cohort, the Rakai Community Cohort Study (RCCS). Within the&#xD;
        RCCS, the Rakai Program has conducted multiple observational, basic science, behavioral and&#xD;
        operations research studies, and has conducted complex community and individual randomized&#xD;
        HIV and sexually transmitted disease (STD) prevention trials.&#xD;
