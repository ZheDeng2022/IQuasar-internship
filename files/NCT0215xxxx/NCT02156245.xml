  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to assess the efficacy of a rehabilitation protocol based on&#xD;
      individualized combined eccentric and concentric cycle ergometer training compared to&#xD;
      classical concentric cycle training among patients with either coronary artery disease (CAD)&#xD;
      or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). This study will therefore evaluate the&#xD;
      efficacy of combined eccentric/concentric training on physical capacity and overall autonomy,&#xD;
      and will analyse the adaptive mechanisms with regard to both adaptation to cardiac and&#xD;
      muscular effort and tolerance.&#xD;

      The research will take place in 3 phases:&#xD;
&#xD;
      PHASE 1 :&#xD;
&#xD;
      30 healthy volunteers will be included to test tolerance to personalized exercise on an&#xD;
      eccentric cycle ergometer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PHASE 2 :&#xD;
&#xD;
      15 patients suffering from coronary artery disease (CAD) and 15 patients suffering from&#xD;
      chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) will be included to test the same protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PHASE 3 :&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 169 patients split into 2 parallel groups will be included: a group receiving&#xD;
      conventional rehabilitation (group A) and the other group receiving eccentric exercise&#xD;
      combined to conventional rehabilitation (group B).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Coronary patients: 93 patients will be included (62 patients in group A and 31 in group B).&#xD;
&#xD;
      COPD patients: 76 patients will be included (38 patients per group).&#xD;
