      This open-label, fixed-sequence crossover study aims to evaluate the effect of GSK1265744&#xD;
      (744) oral administration on the pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD) of a&#xD;
      commonly used oral contraceptive (OC) product (combination of ethinyl estradiol and&#xD;
      levonorgestrel), in 20 healthy female subjects. Each subject will participate in a Run-in&#xD;
      Period (if needed), followed by a single-sequence Treatment Period. Subjects will receive&#xD;
      oral contraceptive containing Levonorgestrel and Ethinyl Estradiol on Days 1 to 21 and be OC&#xD;
      free on Days 22 to 28, during which withdrawal menses should occur. Subjects will receive OC&#xD;
      alone on Days 1 to 10. Levonorgestrel (LNG) and ethinyl estradiol (EE) PK will be determined&#xD;
      on Day 10. Subjects will then co-administer 744 and OC on Days 11 to 21. Levonorgestrel and&#xD;
      ethinyl estradiol PK will be determined again on Day 21 to assess if co-administration with&#xD;
      744 results in a significant change in OC exposure compared to OC alone. Subjects will return&#xD;
      to the study center for final follow-up evaluations 7 to 14 days after the last dose of study&#xD;
      medication (Days 28 to 35).&#xD;

    <description>Eligible subjects will enter a run-in-period of 21 days (may extend to 49 days) to stabilize on OC containing levonorgestrel and ethinyl estradiol in order to synchronize the menstrual cycles of multiple subjects. Subjects completing run-in-period will enter Treatment period 1 and will be dosed OC once daily on Days 1 to 10. At day 11 subjects will enter Treatment period 2 and will be dosed with OC containing levonorgestrel and ethinyl estradiol + 744 once daily on Day 12 to 19. Subjects completing Treatment period 2 will have 7 OC free days (Day 22 to 28) during which withdrawal menses should occur. Subjects will then be followed up for 7 to 14 days (Day 28 to 35/49).</description>
