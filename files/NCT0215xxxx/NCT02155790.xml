  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Ablative Solutions, Inc. Peregrine System Infusion Catheter is a catheter-based device&#xD;
      which is intended to be used to ablate the afferent and efferent sympathetic nerves serving&#xD;
      the kidneys. The catheter is typically inserted via the femoral artery, steered into the&#xD;
      renal artery, and then delivers, by infusion from its distal end, a neurolytic agent. This&#xD;
      targets the nerve bundles, which are in the adventitia - a sheath surrounding the artery. The&#xD;
      aim is to reduce blood pressure in cases of resistant hypertension - seriously elevated blood&#xD;
      pressure which does not respond to drug treatment.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There is strong evidence in the published literature that the renal nerves are important&#xD;
      contributors to hypertension, and that their ablation does not have adverse side-effects. The&#xD;
      literature provides technical, clinical and scientific evidence supporting the use of&#xD;
      perivascular renal denervation for a carefully defined patient group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An existing device (the Ardian Symplicity catheter) has been shown to be safe and effective&#xD;
      for achieving perivascular renal denervation by delivery of radiofrequency energy.&#xD;
      Perivascular renal denervation by radio-frequency energy delivery is an effective therapy,&#xD;
      associated with very low risks. In other contexts, denervation can also be safely and&#xD;
      effectively achieved by neurolytic agents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objectives of the study are to evaluate the safety and performance of renal denervation&#xD;
      by a chemical neurolytic agent delivered into the advential/ periadventitial area of the&#xD;
      renal arteries for the purpose of neurolysis, using the Peregrine System Infusion Catheter,&#xD;
      in patients with refractory hypertension.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The ASI Peregrine System Infusion Catheter is similar enough to the Ardian Symplicity&#xD;
      catheter to enable the use of published data to establish the validity of the design concept&#xD;
      of the Peregrine System and estimate the likely levels of risk from side effects. It can be&#xD;
      concluded from the literature that the ASI Peregrine System will achieve percutaneous renal&#xD;
      denervation with a low risk of procedural complications (comparable to accepted percutaneous&#xD;
      interventional therapies) and without long-term impairment of renal artery or kidney function&#xD;
      or other serious adverse events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Chemical denervation is an appropriate treatment for the specified study population of adults&#xD;
      who have resistant hypertension despite taking at least 3 anti-hypertensive drugs of&#xD;
      different classes including at least one diuretic. In order for the study to be valid, only&#xD;
      one chemical neurolytic agent can be used. The Coordinating Investigator has chosen to use&#xD;
      dehydrated alcohol (96 - 98% by volume) for therapeutic neurolysis, therefore all&#xD;
      participating sites will use this agent. This clinical investigation is intended to provide&#xD;
      clinical data that demonstrates the safety and performance of the ASI Peregrine System&#xD;
      Infusion Catheter.&#xD;
