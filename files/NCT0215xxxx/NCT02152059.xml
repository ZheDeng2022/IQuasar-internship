      This study is being done to evaluate the good and bad effects of BIBF1120 in recurrent,&#xD;
      platinum-sensitive small cell lung cancer patients and to see if BIBF1120 may or may not be&#xD;
      more effective and better tolerated than standard therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Find out the proportion of patients with their small small cell lung cancer controlled&#xD;
           for at least 90 days after treatment with BIBF1120&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Compare the response rate, survival and side effects of BIBF1120 in recurrent,&#xD;
           platinum-sensitive small cell lung cancer patients&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Identify a group of patients who will benefit the most from BIBF1120 In this study,&#xD;
           patients will receive BIBF1120 at 200 mg twice daily continuously. A cycle will be 21&#xD;
           days. During treatment, the dose of BIBF1120 will be held or reduced to lower doses if&#xD;
           patients do not tolerate it well or if the doctors are concerned about the side effects&#xD;
           of BIBF1120 on individual patients.&#xD;

      This study is being done to evaluate the effects of BIBF1120 in recurrent, platinum-sensitive&#xD;
      small cell lung cancer patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To investigate the efficacy and safety of a novel VEGFR-2 and FGFR-1 targeting agent,&#xD;
           BIBF1120, in previously treated, platinum-sensitive small cell lung cancer patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To correlate response to the apoptotic biomarkers, Bcl-XL/Bcl-2 and FDGR-1&#xD;
           amplification.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To correlate response with baseline FLT-PET SUV uptake and change in FLT-PET SUV uptake.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All eligible patients will be treated with 200 mg bid of BIBF1120 daily and 21 days will be&#xD;
      considered as one cycle&#xD;
