  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      From 1996-present, we have used photodynamic therapy (PDT) to treat a number of neoplastic&#xD;
      diseases both on prospective research protocols (for head and neck cancer, pleural&#xD;
      malignancies, peritoneal carcinomatosis or sarcomatosis and prostate cancer) as well as for&#xD;
      FDA approved and off label or compassionate exemption indications (neoplasms of the skin,&#xD;
      bronchus, esophagus, head and neck and pleura). The goal of this treatment is to maximize&#xD;
      quality of life and organ function while minimizing the chance of tumor recurrence. As such,&#xD;
      we would like to retrospectively review the treatment parameters of all patients who&#xD;
      undergo/underwent PDT (including operative notes and photodynamic therapy records) and&#xD;
      treatment outcomes (including all organ functions, performance status, tumor recurrence,&#xD;
      laboratory values and any other data present in the routinely documented follow up visits).&#xD;
      For patients who have died or were lost to follow-up prior to initiation of this study, a&#xD;
      retrospective review of available data will be performed. For patients who are still being&#xD;
      actively followed after PDT or who receive PDT after the initiation of this study, informed&#xD;
      consent will be obtained for obtaining continued follow-up data prospectively and any&#xD;
      previous data will be collected retrospectively.. These subjects will continue to receive&#xD;
      care from their current physicians according to standard medical practice and no attempt will&#xD;
      be made to alter the types of follow-up, radiologic or other diagnostic studies or medical&#xD;
      treatment as a result of enrollment in this study. All data will be de-identified and added&#xD;
      to our already existing PDT treatment outcome databases for outcomes analysis, quality&#xD;
      improvement and reporting of results in abstract and manuscript forms.&#xD;
