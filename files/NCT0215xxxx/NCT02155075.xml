  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Three-dimensional functional Metabolic Imaging (3D MIRA) is a new infrared imaging technology&#xD;
      using the Real Imager 8 (RI8) developed by Real Imaging. This technology generates 3D&#xD;
      metabolic maps of the breast and based on sophisticated machine learning technology, provides&#xD;
      objective risk assessment for the presence of malignant tumor in the breast. The procedure is&#xD;
      non-invasive, comfortable and does not involve ionizing radiation. It is based on acquiring&#xD;
      infrared images of the breast. Those images are processed and analyzed by computers to&#xD;
      provide the objective risk assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The technology is intended to be used as a screening tool for breast cancer and emerges as&#xD;
      highly useful in women for whom screening mammography is sub-optimal, such as women with&#xD;
      dense breast. 3D MIRA is unaffected by breast density and is therefore ideal for evaluating&#xD;
      patients with mammographically dense breasts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this clinical study is to assess the ability of this novel technology to&#xD;
      detect breast cancer in women.&#xD;
