      This is a cross sectional study to estimate the prevalence of the presence of amyloid&#xD;
      deposits in a biopsy of subcutaneous fat cell, carpal flexor retinaculum and synovial tissue&#xD;
      sheath of the flexor tendons requirement for carpal tunnel surgery.&#xD;

      Amyloidosis (A) is a disease caused by the deposit of usually misfolded protein in form of&#xD;
      amorphous fibrillar material in different tissues, which may cause their progressive&#xD;
      dysfunction. The prevalence of amyloidosis varies by population studied and the type of&#xD;
      amyloid. Although the prevalence in the general population is unknown, the Mayo Clinic in&#xD;
      U.S. estimated a 1/90666. This disease generated about 0.0084 % (1367/16232579) of total&#xD;
      hospital visits between April 2008 and April 2009 in England.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The most frequent clinical manifestations are cardiac, renal and hepatic involvement, but&#xD;
      vary widely depending on the type of amyloidosis , organ affected and the extent of the&#xD;
      deposits. Infiltration of amyloid may produce signs and symptoms that could be very similar&#xD;
      to other diseases, like the rheumatologic one. This potentially polymorphous clinic&#xD;
      presentation may suggest under-diagnosis by low clinical suspicion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Carpal tunnel syndrome is frequent in patients with A and may be the initial manifestation.&#xD;
      This syndrome is generated by the progressive infiltration of amyloid fibrils in the&#xD;
      retinaculum flexor and in synovial tissue, causing compression of the medium nerve. A&#xD;
      frequency of up to 13% of carpal tunnel syndrome has been reported in patients with primary&#xD;
      amyloidosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In 1993, Breda et al. assessed 98 tendon and synovial tissue's biopsies of patients operated&#xD;
      for carpal tunnel syndrome. The pathology revealed amyloid deposition in 12% of them, of&#xD;
      which 8 had no evidence of systemic disease. This amyloid deposition was interpreted as&#xD;
      probably secondary to chronic local inflammation. In 1992, Kyle et al. evaluated the&#xD;
      incidence of systemic amyloidosis in a retrospective cohort of 35 patients with carpal tunnel&#xD;
      syndrome and synovial local deposition of amyloidosis without evidence of systemic&#xD;
      amyloidosis. During follow-up only 2 developed systemic amyloidosis and 11 showed only&#xD;
      laboratory abnormalities (9 monoclonal band and 2 monoclonal light chain in the urine). In&#xD;
      this group the amyloid deposition was identified as transthyretin (TTR) dependent in 32 of 35&#xD;
      cases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Even though there are estimations regarding the prevalence of A in general populations&#xD;
      worldwide and in patients with carpal tunnel syndrome surgery, there is no local estimation&#xD;
      in Argentina. Additionally, it is not known if the presentation of amyloid deposits in tendon&#xD;
      elements of pathological the carpal tunnel correlates with subcutaneous amyloid deposit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this project the investigators propose to estimate the prevalence of Amyloidosis in the&#xD;
      synovial tissue of patients with surgical carpal tunnel syndrome and correlate them with&#xD;
      deposits of amyloid in the subcutaneous cellular tissue fat.&#xD;
&#xD;
      What is the prevalence of amyloidosis, in cellular subcutaneous fat biopsy, flexor&#xD;
      retinaculum of the carpus and synovial tissue of the flexor tendons sheath, in patients with&#xD;
      carpal tunnel syndrome surgery?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objective&#xD;
&#xD;
      1. To estimate the prevalence of the presence of amyloid deposits in: (i) a biopsy of&#xD;
      cellular subcutaneous fat, (ii) the flexor retinaculum of the carpus and (iii) synovial&#xD;
      tissue of the flexor tendons sheath, with requirement for carpal tunnel surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Detect and characterize patients with subclinical amyloidosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Identify the protein deposited in patients with amyloidosis.&#xD;
