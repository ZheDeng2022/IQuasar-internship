  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to study the relationships between obesity, hormones and&#xD;
      menopausal status, and breast cancer. The researchers would like to study whether a type of&#xD;
      nutritional intervention, called a time-restricted diet or tRD, is easy to maintain using a&#xD;
      smartphone application; the researchers also want to study the effect that a tRD has on&#xD;
      weight control, hormones, and breast tissue. A tRD is a type of diet that requires people to&#xD;
      restrict their daily eating to a specific time frame each day. The researchers think that&#xD;
      this might be an effective and manageable way to control weight.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Feasibility of fostering adherence to self-monitoring of dietary intake using a smartphone&#xD;
      application (app).&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Feasibility of the goal of following a time-restricted diet.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Identify potential molecular biomarkers and/or signatures to explore its efficacy for the&#xD;
      normalization of metabolism.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Assess the systemic endocrine effects of a time restricted diet (tRD) intervention in&#xD;
      overweight and obese pre and postmenopausal women.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. Assess weight change following a tRD intervention. IV. Evaluate the effects of a tRD&#xD;
      intervention, and identify a specific and reproducible genomic signature, in breast samples&#xD;
      obtained by random fine needle aspiration in the tRD study population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. Assess the volume of parenchymal enhancement on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants follow a time restricted diet, which restricts daily eating to an 8 hour time&#xD;
      window between 12:00-8:00 pm. Participants are allowed to consume non-caloric beverages&#xD;
      (water, black tea, black coffee, diet soda, etc.) during the fasting hours and required to&#xD;
      record daily food consumption in the smartphone app for 6 months. Participants are also&#xD;
      coached by telephone over approximately 10-15 minutes weekly for 1 month and then biweekly&#xD;
      for 5 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion, participants are followed up for 3 months.&#xD;
