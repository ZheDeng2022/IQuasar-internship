        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Confirmed diagnosis of primary hypoparathyroidism for more than 1 year.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Currently taking &gt;1.0 grams of Calcium/day with a correlate alpha D3 dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  25(OH)D levels â‰¥ 20 ng/ml.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Signed informed consent.&#xD;

             abnormalities will be assessed by the Principle Investigator and after discussion with&#xD;
             sponsor patients may still be entered if these are felt to be of &quot;no clinical&#xD;
             importance&quot;. Abnormalities due to hypoparathyroidism related are acceptable and will&#xD;
             not constitute exclusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with significant liver function impairment (liver enzymes above x3 the upper&#xD;
             limit of normal range as per WHO criteria) will be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects able to adhere to the visit schedule and protocol requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Treatment with any investigational product within the last 30 days, enrollment or&#xD;
             intention to enroll in any active study involving the use of investigational devices&#xD;
             or drugs.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Presence of any other condition or circumstance that, in the judgment of the&#xD;

             birth control (reliable use of oral contraceptive, non-hormonal intrauterine device&#xD;
             with condom, or diaphragm with condom, or condom with spermicide) from the screening&#xD;
             visit through the study termination visit or declare that they are abstaining from&#xD;
             sexual intercourse from the screening visit through the study termination visit or are&#xD;
             surgically sterile (have undergone bilateral tubal ligation, bilateral oophorectomy,&#xD;
             or hysterectomy) or post-menopausal. Postmenopausal women are defined as women with&#xD;
