  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to obtain an assessment (efficacy, safety, and patient reported&#xD;
      outcomes) of basal bolus insulin delivery with PaQ in insulin-using patients with type 2&#xD;
      diabetes mellitus (T2DM).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, single center, post-market observational study to assess the efficacy,&#xD;
      safety, and patient reported outcomes of insulin delivery with PaQ® in patients with type 2&#xD;
      diabetes mellitus (T2DM) who are currently receiving basal/bolus insulin therapy with or&#xD;
      without oral anti-diabetic drugs (OADs) for glycemic control. The patient's participation in&#xD;
      the study is comprised of three phases: screening/baseline evaluation, transition to PaQ use&#xD;
      and optimization, and PaQ treatment period. The use of these phases will allow an orderly&#xD;
      transition to PaQ treatment as well as a reliable construct from which to interpret the final&#xD;
      data.&#xD;
