  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to adapt depression treatment intervention for HIV patients in&#xD;
      Cameroon. The PI will validate a depression severity measure, adapt key elements of the&#xD;
      intervention to the Cameroon context, train nurses and physicians to carry out the&#xD;
      intervention, and examine preliminary outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants: Aim 1: Hospital and clinic patients, visitors, health care workers. Aim 2: No&#xD;
      participants. Aim 3: HIV-infected patients. Procedures (methods): Survey instruments and ARV&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;

      Patient registry only applicable to Specific Aim 3. This aim provided depression care&#xD;
      management decision support to all depressed HIV patients who enrolled. There was no&#xD;
      comparison arm. This study was an R34 feasibility study adapting measurement-based depression&#xD;
      care to a low income sub-Saharan African setting, and Aim 3 assessed the logistics enrolling&#xD;
      and monitoring patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      (Per original protocol, which was followed) Specific Aim 3. Demonstrate the feasibility of&#xD;
      recruiting and retaining patients over time and collecting and processing laboratory&#xD;
      specimens.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this aim the investigators seek to quantify objective measures of the feasibility of our&#xD;
      planned RCT to assess the effectiveness of the MBC intervention on ART treatment outcomes in&#xD;
      HIV patients in Cameroon. Specific measures will include percentage of eligible patients that&#xD;
      consent to participate in the study, patient retention over 12 months, percentage of clinic&#xD;
      visits and outcome interviews completed at each time point, and percentage of blood samples&#xD;
      collected, tested and having valid results. These measures will be important in the&#xD;
      quantification of the sample size needed for the definitive RCT. The investigators will also&#xD;
      identify procedures that could hamper the successful implementation of the RCT and propose&#xD;
      appropriate modifications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Feasibility study: To achieve this aim the investigators will conduct a pilot prospective&#xD;
      study with a sample of 60 participants. This study will begin during year 2 of the project&#xD;
      and patients will be accrued over 4 months (15 patients per month) in order to allow for a&#xD;
      smooth processing of participants and samples. Standard clinical care will be modified at&#xD;
      Bamenda ATC so that the DCM will screen all newly presenting HIV patients for depressive&#xD;
      symptoms with the PHQ-9. Patients scoring ≥10 on the PHQ-9 (or above an alternate threshold&#xD;
      established in the validation study) will complete further evaluation with the DCM for&#xD;
      presence of MDD. These patients will have their MDD confirmed by the HIV clinician. This&#xD;
      two-stage screening procedure has been successfully applied by our team at rural medical&#xD;
      clinics with low income patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sampling frame for the feasibility study will consist of all patients who are HIV+, 18-55&#xD;
      years old, and have confirmed MDD. Patients will be excluded if they do not speak English&#xD;
      well enough to complete the instruments or if they are not mentally competent to provide&#xD;
      informed consent, as assessed by the medical team. As noted above, based on Dr. Atashili's&#xD;
      clinical experience the investigators expect &gt;95% of clinic attendees to be able to&#xD;
      communicate effectively in English. Pregnant and breastfeeding women will not be excluded&#xD;
      from the study but will be counseled regarding the particular risks and benefits of&#xD;
      participation for them. AMI has the potential to adversely affect the developing fetus,&#xD;
      primarily through its anticholinergic properties, although recent observational studies and&#xD;
      systematic reviews indicate no increased risk of congenital malformations or developmental&#xD;
      delays associated with AMI use. Further, because ADPs such as AMI are potent agents that act&#xD;
      on the central nervous system, use by nursing mothers presents theoretical short and&#xD;
      long-term risks to the infant's neurodevelopment. Infant behavioral monitoring before and&#xD;
      after initiating treatment with the mother is clinically useful to monitor the effects of&#xD;
      ADPs during nursing. Infants may exhibit short-term effects such as lethargy, poor weight&#xD;
      gain, hypotonia and inconsolability, although the limited data available show that most&#xD;
      infants of nursing mothers taking AMI doses consistent with our protocol have had no&#xD;
      detectable AMI level. Potential neonatal effects must be weighed against the benefits to both&#xD;
      mother and child of successfully treating a MDD. These issues and our related informed&#xD;
      consent plans are discussed in detail in the Human Subjects Protection plan in the grant&#xD;
      application.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each day, the DCM will follow a random number algorithm to randomly select 12 patients from&#xD;
      the daily register of scheduled patients. The investigators expect this to be sufficient to&#xD;
      generate 4 eligible and consenting participants per week (assuming a 25% no show rate, 10%&#xD;
      prevalence of MDD and &lt;20% refusal) or ~15 per month and will adjust it if needed in order to&#xD;
      meet recruitment goals. The DCM will assess eligibility and will invite eligible patients to&#xD;
      participate. Non-consenting patients will be asked their reasons for denial. All patients&#xD;
      with MDD (consenting or not) will be proposed a management plan by the DCM (as described&#xD;
      under Aim 2 above) which will be discussed with the treating physician. Participants will be&#xD;
      encouraged, to the extent they wish, to bring family members to appointments and to involve&#xD;
      their social support structure in their depression treatment plan. For consenting patients&#xD;
      the DCM will collect a whole blood sample to assess viral load ,CD4 count, and liver&#xD;
      function. These samples will be stored at -20o C and transported to the CSCCD laboratory to&#xD;
      be tested using standard procedures - VL using the automated Roche Amplicor assay of HIV VL,&#xD;
      and CD4 counts using flow cytometry. The DCM will issue a follow-up plan to each participant&#xD;
      and collect contact information (home address and phone number when available) to remind&#xD;
      patients of follow-up appointments. To assist patient and provider in balancing pregnancy-&#xD;
      and breastfeeding-related risks and benefits of AMI use, female participants will take a&#xD;
      urine pregnancy test at enrollment and annually thereafter as long as they remain on AMI.&#xD;
      Female participants who are not pregnant will be advised to discuss any plans for fertility&#xD;
      with their provider, and those not wishing to become pregnant will be counseled to either&#xD;
      avoid sexual intercourse or use contraception. Of note, all HIV+ patients at Bamenda are&#xD;
      strongly counseled to either practice abstinence or use barrier methods of protection during&#xD;
      sexual intercourse in order to avoid HIV transmission, with the secondary effect of avoiding&#xD;
      pregnancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up visits will be aimed at assessing the effects of both ARV and ADP treatment.&#xD;
      Assessment of depressive symptoms and ADP side effects will occur every 2 weeks until&#xD;
      remission and every 4 weeks thereafter. Assessments at weeks 12, 24, etc. will occur during&#xD;
      regularly scheduled clinic visits for ART prescription refills. Patients will return to the&#xD;
      clinic for additional in-person assessments at weeks 2, 4, and 8; assessments at weeks 6 and&#xD;
      10 will be conducted by phone when feasible or else in person. Based on Dr. Atashili's&#xD;
      experience with this patient population, the investigators expect approximately 50% of&#xD;
      participants to be reliably reachable by phone. Project funds will pay for additional clinic&#xD;
      visits required by the protocol. Critical decision points for potential modification of the&#xD;
      depression treatment plan (e.g., maintain dose, increase dose, or switch ADP) will occur at&#xD;
      weeks 4, 8, and 12 and will be informed by depressive symptom response and side effects as&#xD;
      described under Aim 2 above. Clinical assessment of HIV disease and blood samples for CD4&#xD;
      counts and viral load will be conducted at the visits at 4, 8 and 12 months of follow-up;&#xD;
      follow-up liver function tests will be performed based on clinical indication. Pregnancy&#xD;
      tests will be repeated annually. Patients will be counseled to avoid alcohol consumption, and&#xD;
      the DCM will clinically monitor alcohol use by asking patients at follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Separate from their ongoing contact with the DCM, participants will complete in-person&#xD;
      interviews at baseline and at months 4, 8, and 12 to assess self-reported general health, ADP&#xD;
      and ARV adherence, and sexual risk behavior. These in-person interviews will be conducted by&#xD;
      a CSCCD interviewer who is not a part of the participants' clinical care to minimize the&#xD;
      potential for social desirability bias. Interviews will be conducted in a private location of&#xD;
      the participant's choosing and will last ~30 minutes. General health will be measured by the&#xD;
      Medical Outcomes Study Short Form-8 (SF-8). Adherence for each medication will be measured&#xD;
      with four visual analog scale (VAS) items asking patients what proportion of the time in the&#xD;
      past month they have taken all of their medication doses; taken more medication than&#xD;
      prescribed; missed or skipped doses; and taken doses on time. VAS adherence measures&#xD;
      correlate well with other self-report measures of adherence and predict virologic failure.&#xD;
      Sexual risk behavior will be measured with questions asking participants about the frequency&#xD;
      of oral, anal, and vaginal sexual intercourse in the preceding 4 months, separately by sex of&#xD;
      the partner, by the partner's HIV status, and by whether a condom was used. The interview&#xD;
      will additionally include questions on age, sex, religious and ethnic identification,&#xD;
      educational attainment, and household income. Finally, the interview will include questions&#xD;
      about the acceptability of the intervention, including patients' perceptions of the&#xD;
      additional time cost imposed by the intervention as well as their willingness and ability to&#xD;
      purchase ADPs (current cost of &lt;$1 per month) if the intervention were part of standard&#xD;
      clinical care rather than a research study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As a second measure of adherence, the investigators will collect pharmacy records of the&#xD;
      quantity and date of all HIV and psychiatric medications dispensed to study participants from&#xD;
      a period starting 4 months before study enrollment to the end of follow-up. All patients&#xD;
      receiving HIV care at Bamenda ATC obtain their HIV medications at the hospital pharmacy,&#xD;
      which would also be the source for any ADP medications prescribed as part of this study.&#xD;
      Adherence will be calculated as the ratio of the number of days' supply of medication divided&#xD;
      by the days elapsed before the next refill. Adherence as measured by pharmacy refills has&#xD;
      been shown in other settings to be associated with virologic outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The DCM will attempt to contact patients who miss any visit by either calling the&#xD;
      participants when phone numbers are available or visiting the patient's home. The&#xD;
      investigators recognize that not all patients have phone numbers and that poor identification&#xD;
      (naming and numbering) of streets/homes will constitute a challenge for identifying&#xD;
      participants' homes. The investigators expect 50% of participants to have phone numbers.&#xD;
