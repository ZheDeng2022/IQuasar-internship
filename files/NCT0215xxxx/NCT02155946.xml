  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aging US population threatens to overwhelm our healthcare infrastructure, especially&#xD;
      since the rate of Alzheimer's disease (AD) alone is expected to triple in the coming decades.&#xD;
      Memory cause functional impairment, reduced quality of life, increased caregiver burnout, and&#xD;
      eventual institutionalization. The diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) identifies&#xD;
      those with memory deficits but who remain relatively independent in everyday life. MCI&#xD;
      provides a window for interventions that target memory functioning. The proposed study&#xD;
      focuses specifically on a groundbreaking combination of mnemonic rehabilitation and&#xD;
      non-invasive brain stimulation. The main idea is that brain stimulation can enhance&#xD;
      functioning in the specific brain regions/networks, thereby increasing the patients' ability&#xD;
      to benefit from different types of memory rehabilitation. This will be a randomized,&#xD;
      double-blind study (active vs. fake brain stimulation), that provides multiple treatment&#xD;
      session. Outcome will be examined using both laboratory-based and real-world memory testing&#xD;
      as well as brain imaging. This first-of-its-kind study has the potential to meaningfully&#xD;
      translate more &quot;basic&quot; science findings into neuroanatomically targeted and functionally&#xD;
      meaningful treatments for our aging population.&#xD;

      Enrollment and interactions/interventions are temporarily paused due to COVID-19 and are&#xD;
      expected to resume in the future. This is not a suspension of IRB approval.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed study focuses specifically on a groundbreaking combination of mnemonic&#xD;
      rehabilitation and non-invasive brain stimulation. The main idea is that brain stimulation&#xD;
      can enhance functioning in the specific brain regions/networks, thereby increasing the&#xD;
      patients' ability to benefit from memory rehabilitation. This will be a randomized,&#xD;
      double-blind study (active vs. fake brain stimulation), that provides multiple treatment&#xD;
      session. Outcome will be examined using both laboratory-based and real-world memory testing&#xD;
      as well as brain imaging. This first-of-its-kind study has the potential to meaningfully&#xD;
      translate more &quot;basic&quot; science findings into neuroanatomically targeted and functionally&#xD;
      meaningful treatments for our aging population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The general purpose of this study is to examine the effects of two types of treatments for&#xD;
      memory impairment in those with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). One form of treatment is&#xD;
      cognitive rehabilitation, which involves teaching new ways to learn and remember information.&#xD;
      The second form of treatment uses a type of electrical brain stimulation called transcranial&#xD;
      direct current stimulation (tDCS) to increase activity in certain brain areas that may be&#xD;
      involved with memory. We will use brain imaging to see whether these treatments changed how&#xD;
      individuals learn and remember information. We will also use cognitive tests and&#xD;
      questionnaires to examine whether memory (and related abilities) changed because of&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;

    <description>Planned analyses to examine patient specific characteristics that affect treatment efficacy and would be vital for clinical translation at the individual patient level. Effect of level of cognitive functioning, measured via neuropsychological test performance at baseline, will be evaluated on magnitude of change at post-treatment and 3 month follow-up. Scores range from -3 to +3 standard deviations.</description>
