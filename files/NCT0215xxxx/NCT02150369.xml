      -Purpose: Phase I: To test the methods, data collection and analysis in a study to evaluate&#xD;
      cognitive/affective/sleep symptoms in one patient undergoing treatment with high-dose&#xD;
      Interleukin-2 (IL-2) for metastatic renal cell carcinoma (RCC), their informal caregiver and&#xD;
      their primary nurse.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase II: A pilot study examining up to 10 IL-2 cases to describe cognitive/affective/sleep&#xD;
      symptoms of patients receiving high-dose IL-2 therapy for metastatic melanoma (MM) or&#xD;
      metastatic RCC in order to develop interventional studies to minimize these symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      -Aims: In this pilot, a case is comprised of the metastatic RCC patient receiving IL-2, their&#xD;
      care partner, and their primary nurse. The care partner for this study will be the family&#xD;
      member or friend staying with the IL-2 patient throughout treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase I (Evaluation of Methods and Procedures):&#xD;
&#xD;
      One case will be examined to evaluate the methods, data collection and analysis to be used in&#xD;
      this study. The aims of Phase I of this study are to: Aim 1) Evaluate recruitment and&#xD;
      enrollment procedures to enroll one IL-2 case, comprised of the IL-2 patient, their care&#xD;
      partner and their primary nurse; Aim 2) Evaluate administration procedures, data collected,&#xD;
      and analysis of four questionnaire scales to detect the trajectory of cognition [Attentional&#xD;
      Function Index and Montreal Cognitive Assessment] and affect [Hamilton Anxiety scale and&#xD;
      Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology-Clinician] in the IL-2 patient from the start to the&#xD;
      end of a cycle of treatment; Aim 3) Evaluate procedures, data collected and analysis of&#xD;
      journal entries from the care partner who are to record their thoughts, observations, and&#xD;
      feelings concerning any changes in the patient's behavior or cognition during IL-2 treatment&#xD;
      every 8 hours; Aim 4) Evaluate procedures, data collected and analysis of semi-structured&#xD;
      questionnaires completed by the primary nurse taking care of the patient receiving IL-2 which&#xD;
      will describe any changes in behavior or cognition in the patient during their IL-2&#xD;
      treatment; and Aim 5) Evaluate procedures, data collected and analysis of data of interviews&#xD;
      with the IL-2 patient to further discern what symptoms endorsed on the measurement scales&#xD;
      represent and how they are characterized, and interviewing the primary nurse to gain any&#xD;
      additional data on cognitive/affective symptoms observed in the IL-2 patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase II (Investigating Cognitive, Affective and Sleep Alterations in Patients Receiving high&#xD;
      dose IL-2 therapy): Up to 10 additional cases will be enrolled to understand cognitive,&#xD;
      affective and sleep symptoms induced from IL-2 therapy in oncology patients with MM or&#xD;
      metastatic RCC, and help design future studies to ameliorate these treatment-limiting&#xD;
      symptoms. The specific aims of this study are to: Aim 1) Describe cognitive (language,&#xD;
      concentration, mental fatigue, confusion, attention, short-term memory, and orientation),&#xD;
      affective (depression, anxiety, mood alterations), and sleep disturbance symptoms in patients&#xD;
      receiving 1 to 4 cycles (up to 8-weeks) of high-dose IL-2 therapy. Aim 2) Examine observed&#xD;
      patient experiences of cognitive/affective/sleep symptoms from each patient's primary care&#xD;
      partner, and primary nurse during 1 to 4 cycles of IL-2 therapy. Aim 3) Describe the&#xD;
      trajectories of cognitive/affective/sleep symptoms in patients with MM or metastatic RCC&#xD;
      undergoing 1 to 4 cycles of IL-2 therapy. Not all patients will receive 4 cycles of IL-2,&#xD;
      because treatment will depend on a) disease progression and b) side effect toxicity;&#xD;
      therefore, the symptom trajectory will be described for the cycles completed in situations&#xD;
      where all cycles are not completed.&#xD;

      -Background &amp; Significance: Alterations in cognitive, affective and sleep functioning are&#xD;
      among the most challenging side effects experienced by 80% of patients undergoing high dose&#xD;
      IL-2 therapy. Altered cognition includes a wide array of symptoms such as changes in&#xD;
      concentration, attention, short-term memory, confusion, mental fatigue, executive&#xD;
      functioning, abstraction, language, basic arithmetic, and orientation. Affective symptoms&#xD;
      include mood alterations, depression, anxiety, psychosis, hallucinations, aggression,&#xD;
      suicidal ideation, and coma. Sleep symptoms include the insomnias (initial, middle, delayed)&#xD;
      and hypersomnia. Severe cognitive/affective/sleep symptoms may result in early termination of&#xD;
      IL-2 therapy, preventing the patient from receiving its full benefits. In some patients,&#xD;
      cognitive, affective and sleep symptoms continue throughout the remainder of their life,&#xD;
      decreasing the quality of life for patients and their families. Although prior investigators&#xD;
      reported chemotherapy-related altered cortical and cognitive function including slowed&#xD;
      processing time and decreased brain activation, as well as signs of increased cytokines and&#xD;
      decreased gray matter, studies investigating the trajectory of immunotherapy-related altered&#xD;
      cognition have not been found in published literature. Describing the impact of IL-2 therapy&#xD;
      on cognition, affect and sleep is essential to designing interventions to ameliorate these&#xD;
      treatment-limiting symptoms. Because IL-2 patients receive several doses of medication over a&#xD;
      number of days, exploring these symptoms through a trajectory analysis of these symptoms is&#xD;
      critical. Without fully understanding the breadth and depth of IL-2-induced&#xD;
      cognitive/affective/sleep symptoms, advances in science to alleviate these symptoms are at a&#xD;
      standstill.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Metastatic RCC and MM are two cancers treated with IL-2, where surgery, chemotherapy and&#xD;
      radiation therapy are ineffective for patients with stage III and IV disease. For phase I of&#xD;
      this pilot study, we will focus only on enrolling one IL-2 patient with metastatic RCC, their&#xD;
      care partner and their primary nurse; as many five subjects comprising one case may be&#xD;
      recruited for consent. In 2014, the National Cancer Institute estimates 76,000 new diagnoses&#xD;
      and 9,700 deaths secondary to melanoma, and 64,000 new cases and 14,000 deaths secondary to&#xD;
      kidney cancer. IL-2, a cytokine based immunotherapy, is administered to patients with&#xD;
      metastatic disease to stimulate their immune systems to fight off cancerous cells, and is one&#xD;
      of the few treatments available for patients with progressed disease. When IL-2 is&#xD;
      administered in high-dose, intravenous form, patients experience severe and potentially&#xD;
      life-threatening side effects. The long-term impact of IL-2 treatments on cognitive/affective&#xD;
      symptoms has not been documented. Despite severe symptoms and side effects, 33% of MM&#xD;
      patients have some response to IL-2 treatment and 15% of MM patients show a complete response&#xD;
      with no detectable metastases after treatment. In RCC, 14% of patients show some response and&#xD;
      8% show a complete response. Thus, interventions that help patients complete treatment are&#xD;
      warranted and would build on knowledge gained in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      -Procedures: Phase I will enroll a case over one cycle of high-dose IL-2 given over five&#xD;
      days. Phase II will enroll up to 10 additional cases for up to four cycles of high-dose IL-2&#xD;
      therapy. High-dose IL-2 is defined as 600,000-720,000 International Units/kilogram,&#xD;
      administered intravenously over 15 minutes, every 8 hours for a maximum of 14 consecutive&#xD;
      doses; these 14 doses comprise one treatment cycle. Quantitative data will be collected using&#xD;
      questionnaires administered to the IL-2 patient measuring cognitive/affective/sleep symptoms&#xD;
      before and after each cycle of high-dose IL-2 to describe any longitudinal changes in the&#xD;
      patient over the therapy course. Qualitative data will be collected through semi-structured&#xD;
      journal entries written by the care partner, semi-structured questionnaires given to the&#xD;
      nurses after each dose of IL-2, and interviews with the IL-2 patient, care partner and&#xD;
      primary nurse.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Three constructs (cognitive symptoms, affective symptoms, sleep symptoms) will be used to&#xD;
      describe IL-2-induced cognitive/affective/sleep symptoms using four sources for data&#xD;
      collection (the IL-2 patient, their primary care partner, their nurses, and their primary&#xD;
      nurse). The index participant will receive up to three high-dose IL-2 treatments per day, at&#xD;
      8-hour intervals, for a maximum of 14 doses per cycle. The pattern of data collection in&#xD;
      Phase I will repeat for a maximum of four IL-2 cycles in Phase II.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cognitive/affective/sleep symptoms experienced by the patient will be evaluated using six&#xD;
      scales. Scales will be administered to the index participant upon their admission to the&#xD;
      hospital before receiving the first dose of IL-2 in each cycle, and 16-hrs after the last&#xD;
      IL-2 dose for each cycle. The nurse caring for the IL-2 patient will be contacted over the&#xD;
      phone and we will be in constant communication about the timing of IL-2 administration and&#xD;
      therapy ending. Questionnaires will be administered in the patient's private hospital room.&#xD;
      Although it would be ideal to administer these surveys following each IL-2 dose, the IL-2&#xD;
      patient is disrupted every four hours for IL-2 related care. Administering the scales only&#xD;
      twice during each cycle will reduce patient burden and will be sufficient to assess for&#xD;
      longitudinal changes in cognitive/affective/sleep symptoms. For symptoms endorsed by the&#xD;
      patient 16-hr post-treatment, we will interview the IL-2 patient to further discern what&#xD;
      these symptoms represent and how they are characterized. This semi-structured interview will&#xD;
      be recorded and transcribed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The care partner will be asked to record observations of the patient's cognitive, affective&#xD;
      and sleep symptoms as a journal entry three times per day, prior to the first IL-2 dose and&#xD;
      then after each dose. The semi-structured journal entry will contain a checklist to signify&#xD;
      when symptoms are observed by the care partner, such as the patient pulling out catheters or&#xD;
      intravenous lines, confusion, hallucinating, signs of depression, and/or anxiety. The&#xD;
      checklist will be followed by a prompt that will read, &quot;For the boxes you checked above,&#xD;
      please describe the changes you witnessed. When did the symptom appear? How long did the&#xD;
      symptom last? How severe is the symptom? Can you describe the situation? Did anything make&#xD;
      this symptom better or worse?&quot; Following this prompt, the final open-ended prompt will read,&#xD;
      &quot;If there are other changes in the patient that you feel the team should know about, please&#xD;
      feel free to write about these changes as well.&quot; After treatment has ended, the care partner&#xD;
      will participate in a post-treatment semi-structured interview at the end of each cycle of&#xD;
      therapy. This interview will be recorded and transcribed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Similar to the care partner, nurses that participate in the patient's care will receive the&#xD;
      same semi-structured prompt as the care partner. Nurses will also be asked to write, 'I did&#xD;
      not witness any cognitive or affective changes in the IL-2 patient during my time with the&#xD;
      patient' if changes in symptoms were not observed. A folder containing the prompt for the&#xD;
      nurses will be kept in a secure place on the unit for the nurses to access so they can&#xD;
      retrieve a form containing the prompt prior to doing their nursing assessment. The nurses&#xD;
      will be encouraged to complete the form after each IL-2 infusion. Once the primary nurse for&#xD;
      the IL-2 patient is identified, we will approach s/he for consent and interview the primary&#xD;
      nurse to gain any additional data on cognitive/affective/sleep symptoms observed in the IL-2&#xD;
      patient. This interview will be recorded and transcribed. Field notes will be collected&#xD;
      throughout the study to enrich the data. Collection of data from multiple sources such as&#xD;
      interviews, journal entries and field notes will allow for a comprehensive understanding of&#xD;
      the data.&#xD;
