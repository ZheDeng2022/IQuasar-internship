      This phase I trial studies the side effects and the best dose of genetically modified T-cells&#xD;
      after lymphodepleting chemotherapy in treating patients with acute myeloid leukemia or&#xD;
      blastic plasmacytoid dendritic cell neoplasm that has returned after a period of improvement&#xD;
      or has not responded to previous treatment. An immune cell is a type of blood cell that can&#xD;
      recognize and kill abnormal cells in the body. The immune cell product will be made from&#xD;
      patient or patient's donor (related or unrelated) blood cells. The immune cells are changed&#xD;
      by inserting additional pieces of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) (genetic material) into the&#xD;
      cell to make it recognize and kill cancer cells. Placing a modified gene into white blood&#xD;
      cells may help the body build an immune response to kill cancer cells.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To examine the anti-tumor activity and safety of administering ex vivo&#xD;
      expanded T cells that are genetically modified using a self-inactivating (SIN) lentiviral&#xD;
      vector to express a co-stimulatory CD123-specific chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) as well as&#xD;
      a truncated EGFR (CD123CAR-CD28-CD3zeta-EGFRt+ T cells [CD123+ CAR T cells]) following&#xD;
      lymphodepletion for patients with CD123+ relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukemia (AML)&#xD;
      (arm 1), or CD123+ persistent or recurrent Blastic Plasmacytoid Dendritic Cell Neoplasm&#xD;
      (BPDCN) (arm 2). II. To determine the recommended Phase II dose (RP2D) for both arms (AML and&#xD;
      BPDCN). SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To assess activity in the form of CD123+ CAR T cell&#xD;
      persistence, 6 month progression free survival (PFS 6mo) rate, and 1 year overall survival&#xD;
      (OS) rate, and describe the immunogenicity of CD123R(EQ)28zeta/EGFRt+ T cells. TERTIARY&#xD;
      OBJECTIVES: I. To assess impact on hematopoiesis, change from baseline in numbers of CD123+&#xD;
      blood cells, CD123 expression on malignant cells and hematopoietic cells, and the clinical&#xD;
      efficacy of EGFRt mediated CAR T cell ablation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of autologous or allogeneic (related or unrelated&#xD;
      donor) CD123+ CAR T cells. Patients undergo a lymphodepleting regimen 3-10 days prior to&#xD;
      CD123+ CAR T cell infusion as determined by the principal investigator and the protocol team.&#xD;
      Patients receive either cyclophosphamide intravenously (IV) on days -4 and/or -3; fludarabine&#xD;
      phosphate and cyclophosphamide IV on days -5 to -3; fludarabine phosphate IV on days -5 to -3&#xD;
      and cyclophosphamide IV on days -4 and/or -3. Patients receive autologous or allogeneic&#xD;
      CD123+ CAR T cells IV over 15 minutes on day 0. Patients with evidence of disease at &gt; 28&#xD;
      days, continuing expression of the CD123 antigen, and not having experienced a dose-limiting&#xD;
      toxicity (DLT) may receive a second infusion of CD123+ CAR T cells after 28 days. After&#xD;
      completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 24 hours, then every 2 days for up&#xD;
      to 14 days, every week for 1 month, every month for 1 year and then yearly for 15 years.&#xD;

          -  ALLOGENEIC DONOR CRITERIA FOR APHERESIS DONATION:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Related donor selection will be conducted in accordance with City of Hope's&#xD;
                  Department of Hematology &amp; Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation criteria and, in&#xD;
                  the case of unrelated donor from a transplant center, will comply with the&#xD;
                  National Marrow Donor Program's (NMDP) donor selection standards; when a&#xD;
                  potentially eligible recipient of an unrelated donor product from an NMDP Center&#xD;
                  is identified, the recipient will complete an NMDP search transfer request to&#xD;
                  allow City of Hope (COH) NMDP staff to contact the NMDP Coordinating Center, who&#xD;
                  in turn, will contact the donor's prior Donor Center; the search will follow the&#xD;
                  NMDP Policy for subsequent donation requests; any form deemed appropriate and&#xD;
                  necessary by the NMDP, including the Subsequent Donation Request Form,&#xD;
                  Therapeutic T Cell Collection Prescription and Therapeutic Stem Cell Collection&#xD;
                  Prescription, will be submitted as required&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  In the case of a related donor: The identified donor must be the original donor&#xD;
                  whose stem cells were used for the research participant's allogeneic stem cell&#xD;
                  transplantation (alloSCT)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  For both related and unrelated donors: The donor's hepatitis B surface antigen&#xD;
                  must be negative and the hepatitis C antibody must be nonreactive; in the case of&#xD;
                  a positive hepatitis C antibody result, the hepatitis C virus (HCV) viral&#xD;
                  polymerase chain reaction (PCR) will have to be performed and the results should&#xD;
                  be negative&#xD;

             pulmonary disease or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance&#xD;
             with study requirements; such social situations include but are not limited to lack of&#xD;
             reliable means of transportation for follow up, inability to make time for required&#xD;
             clinic visits due to work or family needs, or lack of reliable ways of communication&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Research participants who have tested human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) positive, or&#xD;
             have active hepatitis B or C infection based on testing performed within 4 weeks of&#xD;
             enrollment&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Research participants with presence of other active malignancy. However, research&#xD;
             participants with history of prior malignancy treated with curative intent and in&#xD;
             complete remission are eligible&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant and lactating women are excluded from this study&#xD;
&#xD;
        Study-Specific Exclusion&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Failure of research participant to understand the basic elements of the protocol&#xD;
             and/or the risks/benefits of participating in this phase I study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or&#xD;
             biological composition to cetuximab&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Dependence on corticosteroids:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  If the participant is undergoing leukapheresis: physiological replacement doses&#xD;
                  of steroids are allowed - prednisone no more than 7.5 mg, hydrocortisone less&#xD;
                  than 12 mg/m^2/day&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  However, all participants must be able to reduce steroid requirement to no&#xD;
                       more than physiological replacement doses prior to start of lymphodepletion&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Active autoimmune disease requiring systemic immunosuppressive therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Research participants will be excluded, who in the opinion of the investigator, may&#xD;
             not be able to comply with the safety monitoring requirements of the study&#xD;
