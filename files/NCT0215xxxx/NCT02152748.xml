      Summary of scientific evidence and rationale of this project:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Integrative molecular-genetic approaches have provided important insights in the biology of&#xD;
      glioblastoma. It has meanwhile become clear, that glioblastoma is not a single tumor entity&#xD;
      but comprises different molecular subtypes, which are associated with a distinct&#xD;
      genetic/epigenetic signature and prognosis. Multimodal treatment approaches combining radio-&#xD;
      and chemotherapy as well as the recent introduction of novel antiangiogenic agents have&#xD;
      resulted in increasing survival times and improved quality-of-life of glioblastoma patients.&#xD;
      Yet, despite these intense treatment efforts the therapeutic efficacy in glioblastoma&#xD;
      patients is limited, leading in virtually all cases to tumor recurrence and death of the&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As only a limited fraction of glioblastoma patients undergo second neurosurgery at tumor&#xD;
      recurrence (&lt; 10%), post-therapeutic samples are rare and no systematic, large-scale studies&#xD;
      exist, which address post-therapeutic morphological and molecular alterations in glioblastoma&#xD;
      tumor tissue. Yet, these data would help to improve the understanding of mechanisms involved&#xD;
      in therapy-resistance and tumor progression, to develop new therapeutic approaches and could&#xD;
      pave the way for personalized treatment strategies.&#xD;

      Objectives of the project:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to analyze systematically morphological and molecular changes&#xD;
      associated with glioblastoma progression and therapy-resistance in matched pre- and&#xD;
      post-therapeutic glioblastoma samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following primary aims will be addressed:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Morphological characterisation of changes in a large series of matched glioblastoma&#xD;
           tissues pertaining to i. Vascularization and hypoxia-mediated factors ii. Tumor necrosis&#xD;
           and chemoradiation-induced necrosis iii. Inflammatory response iv. Tumor cellularity and&#xD;
           proliferation v. Tumor cell phenotype after treatment e.g. glial-mesenchymal transition&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Molecular analyses&#xD;
&#xD;
           i. Transcriptomic, DNA methylation and genomic profiling will be performed to detect&#xD;
           changes in gene expression, methylation and copy number aberrations in post-therapeutic&#xD;
           as compared to pre-therapeutic tumor tissue. ii. The relationship between the&#xD;
           transcriptomic, DNA methylation and genomic profiles will be analyzed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Exploratory analysis of associations between morphological and molecular changes in a&#xD;
           screening set of 30 glioblastoma cases (with available fresh frozen tissues at first and&#xD;
           second surgery) and subsequent validation of relevant findings in a larger glioblastoma&#xD;
           cohort (150 cases with matched formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissues) by appropriate&#xD;
           methods including immunohistochemistry, fluorescence-in-situ-hybridization, and&#xD;
           sequencing.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Special attention will be paid to gender-specific patterns of therapy-related changes&#xD;
           and tumor progression.&#xD;

        All newly diagnosed GB patients will be identified in the Austrian population since 2007 -&#xD;
        after the current firstline therapy has become standard, in order to warrant a homogenously&#xD;
        treated patient cohort. GB patients with multiple resections will be identified.&#xD;
