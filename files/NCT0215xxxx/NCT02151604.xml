  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Lung cancer is the second most commonly diagnosed cancer in the United Kingdom, accounting&#xD;
      for 22% of cancer deaths. The main treatments for lung cancer are surgery, radiotherapy or&#xD;
      chemoradiotherapy. Current methods, for assessing lung function in lung cancer patients i.e.&#xD;
      spirometry and gas transfer are inadequate. We aim to develop a new technique capable of&#xD;
      describing regional lung abnormality using hyperpolarized xenon gas MRI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will involve 50 patients diagnosed with lung cancer considered suitable for radical&#xD;
      radiotherapy or chemoradiotherapy. Participants will be offered hyperpolarized Xe129 MR at&#xD;
      baseline, two weeks after commencement of radiotherapy schedules and four followup visits&#xD;
      over one year posttreatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will undertake extensive study measures at baseline and followup visits, including&#xD;
      chest CT scans, ventilation/perfusion nuclear medicine scans, gadolinium enhanced MRI scans,&#xD;
      pulmonary function tests, breathlessness scores, radiotherapy induced lung toxicity&#xD;
      assessments and exercise testing. Participation in these full tests takes a day, allowing&#xD;
      patients time to rest between tests and allowing for a period of observation following the&#xD;
      final hyperpolarized xenon scan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will correlate baseline hyperpolarized Xe129 MR imaging with spirometry and&#xD;
      breathlessness scores to determine if tolerance for radiotherapy is better predicted by&#xD;
      hyperpolarized Xe129 MR imaging. The investigators will evaluate changes in hyperpolarized&#xD;
      Xe129 MR imaging before and after radiotherapy (RT) to determine if it provides better&#xD;
      monitoring of response compared with spirometry.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will take place at the Churchill Hospital, Oxford University Hospitals National&#xD;
      Health Service Trust and will be funded by the National Institute for Health Research Oxford&#xD;
      Biomedical Research Centre. Hyperpolarized Xe129 MR imaging has the potential to inform&#xD;
      individual suitability for radiotherapy schedules better than the investigations used&#xD;
      currently. In addition, hyperpolarized Xe129 MR imaging has the potential for better&#xD;
      monitoring of treatment response and improved detection of radiation induced lung injury,&#xD;
      invaluable to treating patients with radiation induced injury.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Survival rates for lung cancer are poor. One year survival rate in the United Kingdon for&#xD;
      males is 27% and for females 30%, falling to less than 10% at five years. Prognosis for lung&#xD;
      cancer is so poor because over two thirds of patients are diagnosed at a late stage when&#xD;
      curative treatment is not possible. Early diagnosis and assessment of tolerance for curative&#xD;
      treatment would make a significant difference to survival rates.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Histologically, approximately 80% of lung cancer is nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The&#xD;
      main curative treatment for NSCLC is surgery. Radical radiotherapy and chemoradiotherapy are&#xD;
      other potentially curative treatments. These are suitable for patients who present with&#xD;
      localized tumours that are surgically unresectable due to involvement of critical local&#xD;
      structures or medically inoperable disease due to advanced age or comorbidities. Radiotherapy&#xD;
      aims to deliver a high tumouricidal dose to the tumour without damaging the surrounding&#xD;
      normal lung tissue. A high dose of radiotherapy improves local control but incurs a risk of&#xD;
      inducing toxic effects in the normal lung tissue. If radiationinduced lung toxicity could be&#xD;
      better predicted and monitored, radical radiotherapy could be tailored to the individual,&#xD;
      which could also have the benefit of avoiding or reducing radiation dose to functional lung&#xD;
      tissue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently assessment of patients for radiotherapy involves lung function measurements to&#xD;
      provide a clinical indicator as to whether or not the patient would tolerate treatment and&#xD;
      maintain sufficient functioning lung posttreatment to continue with activities of daily&#xD;
      living without significant impairment. The current gold standard for assessment of lung&#xD;
      function is spirometry and gas transfer. Spirometry and gas transfer measure global lung&#xD;
      function but provides no information about the different regions of the lung or regarding the&#xD;
      support 'framework' of the lung, the parenchyma.Changes in lung function as measured by&#xD;
      spirometry or gas transfer do not coherently correlate with symptom severity or reflect a&#xD;
      decline in patient health. This weak relationship is probably because the lung is a complex&#xD;
      regional organ where localized disturbances of a variety of factors including gas flow&#xD;
      (ventilation), blood flow (perfusion) and gas transfer all combine to impair respiratory&#xD;
      function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To address these issues we aim to use hyperpolarized xenon gas (Xe129) magnetic resonance&#xD;
      imaging (MRI)and computed tomography (CT)to describe detailed regional and structural lung&#xD;
      abnormality in patients with NSCLC. The investigators will correlate this technique with&#xD;
      baseline spirometry and dyspnoea scores to determine if respiratory tolerance of radiotherapy&#xD;
      is better predicted by hyperpolarized Xe129 MR imaging. The investigators will compare&#xD;
      hyperpolarized Xe129 MRI with standard imaging(nuclear medicine scans). The investigators&#xD;
      will also evaluate changes in hyperpolarized Xe129 MR imaging before, during and after&#xD;
      radiotherapy to determine if it provides improved assessment of radiationinduced lung injury.&#xD;
      MRI has advantage of being free from ionizing radiation making it safe and practical for&#xD;
      diseases like lung cancer where repeated followup scans are necessary. MR imaging has an&#xD;
      enhanced speed of image acquisition compared with CT and lung scintigraphy and offers the&#xD;
      potential of dynamic assessment of lungs during respiration. In conventional MRI, the signal&#xD;
      originates principally from the protons in water molecules of tissues. Therefore conventional&#xD;
      MRI has limited use in respiratory disease because the lung has a very low density of&#xD;
      protons, instead being largely composed of air spaces that do not generate MR signal.&#xD;
      Hyperpolarised noble gases can resolve this problem. Xenon (Xe129) is an unreactive or inert&#xD;
      noble gas. It has a nuclear spin of Â½ enabling use in MR imaging to generate a signal. Xe129&#xD;
      is hyperpolarized, that is to say that nuclear spin within the atoms is increased.&#xD;
      Hyperpolarization increases the MR signal enabling the Xe129 gas to show up on the MR scan.&#xD;
      In portions of the lung that have good airflow, the hyperpolarized Xe129 gas will show up&#xD;
      more and be seen more quickly. In addition Xe129 readily dissolves in blood where it emits&#xD;
      different MR signal characteristics. This property may be exploited to regionally quantify&#xD;
      both ventilation and perfusion within the lung providing a comprehensive assessment of lung&#xD;
      function. The need for improved functional imaging to identify preexisting lung disease and&#xD;
      predict respiratory tolerance of patients with NSCLC for radiotherapy treatment is clear.&#xD;
      Hyperpolarized Xe129 MR imaging has the potential to inform individual suitability for&#xD;
      radiotherapy schedules better than the investigations used currently. In addition improved&#xD;
      functional imaging is required to monitor treatment response and enable treatment regimes to&#xD;
      be tailored to the individual. Hyperpolarized Xe129 MR imaging offers the potential of&#xD;
      improved detection of radiationinduced lung injury, invaluable to treating patients with&#xD;
      radiation induced injury. It may also provide information that would allow RT to be planned&#xD;
      in such a way as to reduce the risk of patients developing radiationinduced lung toxicity&#xD;
      (RILT).&#xD;
