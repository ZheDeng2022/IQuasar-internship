  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase I, open label, first in human study designed to evaluate the safety,&#xD;
      tolerability and PK of escalating doses of DCBCI0901 in patients with advanced solid tumors.&#xD;
      Each treatment cycle will be 28 days in duration with no gap between cycles. During each&#xD;
      cycle, DCBCI0901 will be administered slowly as a 30 minute intravenous (IV) infusion (use of&#xD;
      infusion pump preferred) once daily (QD) in the first 5 day dosing period (Days 1 to 5),&#xD;
      which will be followed by 9 days of recovery and observation (Days 6 14). DCBCI0901 will be&#xD;
      administered intravenously QD in a second 5 day dosing period (Days 15 through 19), followed&#xD;
      again by 9 days of recovery and observation (Days 20 through 28).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients may continue to receive treatment in 28 day cycles after completion of Cycle 1. To&#xD;
      qualify for continued treatment beyond Cycle 1, all of the following criteria must be&#xD;
      fulfilled:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The patient is willing to receive further treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Toxicity induced by the IP is not considered to be unbearable as judged by the&#xD;
           Investigator&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The patient does not have PD as defined by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The patient satisfies the criteria for dosing&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The patient does not meet any of the criteria for withdrawal&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the first cycle, CT/MRI assessment will be performed once every 8 weeks (2 cycles) for&#xD;
      efficacy evaluation, or per Investigator judgment. After the first year of treatment, the&#xD;
      Investigator will assess the patient using CT/MRI based on his/her discretion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety data will be evaluated according to normal practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Upon discontinuation of study treatment (if applicable), assessments for the Early&#xD;
      termination visit (if discontinuation occurs in Cycle 1) or End of Treatment visit (if&#xD;
      discontinuation occurs in Cycle 2 or onwards) should occur within 3 days of discontinuation.&#xD;
      Assessments for the Follow up visit (10 days [±1 day] after the last dose of IP) and End of&#xD;
      Study (EOS) visit (30 days [±3 days] after the last dose of IP)&#xD;
