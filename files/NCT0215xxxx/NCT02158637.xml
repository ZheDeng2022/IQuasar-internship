      This study is being done to try out questions from a large set of questions called the&#xD;
      Patient-Reported Outcomes Version of the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events&#xD;
      (PRO-CTCAE). The PRO-CTCAE is a set of questions which asks patients about their symptoms.&#xD;
      This study will look at properties of these questions and will provide information about how&#xD;
      these questions can be improved for research studies. PRO-CTCAE questions were developed&#xD;
      under a contract from the National Cancer Institute (NCI) to allow patients to self-report&#xD;
      symptoms in future cancer clinical trials. Patients with cancer receiving treatment will&#xD;
      complete a web-based questionnaire containing PRO-CTCAE questions and a paper booklet&#xD;
      containing a commonly used questionnaire for assessing quality of life, functioning, and&#xD;
      symptoms at two visits one to six weeks apart. Some patients will additionally complete&#xD;
      web-based questionnaires containing PRO-CTCAE questions weekly for four to five weeks, while&#xD;
      completing a daily questionnaire containing PRO-CTCAE questions using an automated telephone&#xD;
      system. Lastly, a small number of patients will complete only a single visit in which a&#xD;
      web-based, telephone-based, and paper-based questionnaire containing PRO-CTCAE items is&#xD;
      completed in addition to a paper booklet containing a commonly used questionnaire for&#xD;
      assessing quality of life, functioning, and symptoms. The primary hypothesis is that scores&#xD;
      for PRO-CTCAE questions will differ between patients with high versus low general well-being&#xD;
      as measured by your doctor using a scale called the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group&#xD;
      Performance Score.&#xD;
