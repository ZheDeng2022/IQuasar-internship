  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is the most common type of sleep apnea and is caused by an&#xD;
      obstruction of the upper airways. The obstruction results in periods of intermittent hypoxia&#xD;
      and re-oxygenation, which lead to increased oxidative stress, increased inflammation,&#xD;
      endothelial dysfunction, and insulin resistance. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)&#xD;
      is a lung disease that leads to poor airflow. This disease leads to systemic hypoxia, reduced&#xD;
      oxidative capacity, and increased inflammation. The direct cause of OSA and COPD is unclear,&#xD;
      but OSA and COPD may be linked to other comorbid conditions such as obesity and type II&#xD;
      diabetes. Upon onset of OSA and COPD, metabolic disturbances associated with obesity and type&#xD;
      II diabetes can be exacerbated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Obesity is a condition characterized by an increase in visceral fat, elevated plasma levels&#xD;
      of free fatty acids, inflammation, and insulin resistance. Although the effects of body fat&#xD;
      distribution have not been studied in these patients, an increase in both subcutaneous and&#xD;
      abdominal fat mass in non-OSA older women was shown to increase morbidity and mortality.&#xD;
      Fat/adipose tissue is an active tissue capable of secreting proinflammatory cytokines such as&#xD;
      tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha and interleukin (IL)-6, reactive oxygen species and&#xD;
      adipokines. Particularly, abdominal fat is a prominent source of pro-inflammatory cytokines,&#xD;
      which contributes to a low grade, chronic inflammatory state in these patients. Additionally,&#xD;
      an increased inflammatory state is associated with reduced lean body mass, and together with&#xD;
      elevated circulating free fatty acids may increase the occurrence of lipotoxicity and insulin&#xD;
      resistance. Thus, increased fat deposition is associated with a poor prognosis in OSA and&#xD;
      COPD patients and therefore it is of clinical and scientific importance to understand the&#xD;
      changes in fat metabolism and digestion as a result of OSA and COPD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is therefore our hypothesis that fat synthesis and insulin resistance is increased and&#xD;
      whole body protein synthesis is decreased in OSA and COPD patients, leading to a poor&#xD;
      prognosis.&#xD;

      This research study involves 3 visits for subjects and healthy controls. The first visit is&#xD;
      the screening visit and includes review of the informed consent and a DXA scan and the second&#xD;
      and third visit for the study days. For the first test day, 3 hours of the subjects time will&#xD;
      be for urine and blood sample collection, and to stable isotope administration (deuterated&#xD;
      water, isotopically labeled amino acids). Subjects are allowed to go home after and eat&#xD;
      normally. On the second study day, subjects will arrive early that morning. For the duration&#xD;
      of the study, subjects have to lie in the bed (except for bathroom privileges). They can&#xD;
      watch tv or bring and use a book/tablet. The research nurse or study staff will be present in&#xD;
      the human subject area to assist the subject if necessary. Subjects are not allowed to eat or&#xD;
      drink during the second test day, except for the test drink (meal) and water. One IV catheter&#xD;
      will be placed in a vein of the arm/hand for blood draws. The hand will be placed in a hot&#xD;
      box during blood collection. Another IV catheter will be placed in the contra-lateral forearm&#xD;
      for a primed and continuous infusion of isotopes (isotopically labeled amino acids and&#xD;
      glycerol). Each day, a total of 80-100 ml of blood will be obtained. Stable isotopes will be&#xD;
      ingested and infused on the first test day and added to the test drinks and infused on the&#xD;
      second day. On the second test day, subjects will fill out questionnaires. After completion&#xD;
      of the study, we will provide the subject with a meal.&#xD;

        Subjects with OSA or COPD will be recruited when visiting a medical or pulmonary clinic in&#xD;
        and outside the surrounding area of College Station. Patients and healthy subjects will&#xD;
        also be recruited by responding to distributed flyers in the community in the College&#xD;
        Station area; for example in hospital/clinic waiting areas, clinic rooms and bulletin&#xD;
        boards at Scott &amp; White and the CSMC or any other hospital. Other general recruitment&#xD;
        material in relation to the nutrition research that the research group performs at Texas&#xD;
        A&amp;M can be placed on bulletin boards at Scott &amp; White and the CSMC.&#xD;
