    <textblock>
      Chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) is a common sinus and nasal condition affecting more than 33&#xD;
      million Americans. The treatment of CRS typically begins with maximal medical therapy&#xD;
      however, when this fails to improve patient symptoms, surgical intervention is considered.&#xD;
      Endoscopic sinus surgery (ESS) is a well-established treatment for refractory CRS with&#xD;
      approximately 600,000 sinus surgeries performed annually in the United States alone. Despite&#xD;
      the success of this intervention, up to 26% of patients experience complications following&#xD;
      surgery, including middle meatal (MM) synechiae, edema, polyp recurrence, and middle&#xD;
      turbinate lateralization. Currently, there is no consensus as to the postoperative care&#xD;
      regime that is most effective at minimizing or preventing these potential complications.&#xD;
      Therefore there is need for further study into the role of debridement, examining patients&#xD;
      undergoing endoscopic sinus surgery while concurrently addressing the potential confounders&#xD;
      of maximal medical therapies in the postoperative setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This prospective, randomized, single-blind, controlled study design will investigate the&#xD;
      efficacy of postoperative debridement following ESS. Patients who have undergone ESS will&#xD;
      have one nare randomized to debridement and the other to no debridement at the first week&#xD;
      post-operative visit. In this way, the patients will act as their own controls in order to&#xD;
      account for inter-patient variability in disease severity. The primary outcome will assess&#xD;
      synechiae formation attributed to ESS. Secondary outcomes will include pain (side-specific)&#xD;
      attributed to the debridement procedure as well as comparing pre and post endoscopy scores&#xD;
      and SNOT-22 questionnaire responses.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The significant heterogeneity present in the current literature regarding the use of&#xD;
      postoperative debridement warrants additional studies that document postoperative protocols&#xD;
      and use universally accepted endoscopy scores in order to consistently track patient&#xD;
      outcomes. Further investigation into the efficacy of postoperative debridement is especially&#xD;
      interesting with the potential benefits of further reduced synechiae formation and edema.&#xD;
      Conversely, if objective evidence fails to demonstrate benefit of postoperative debridement,&#xD;
      there could be significant cost and time saving for healthcare professionals in removing this&#xD;
      therapy from the postoperative protocols.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We hypothesize that postoperative debridement will have a significant effect on reducing the&#xD;
      rates of synechiae formation. In addition, we hypothesize that this improvement in synechiae&#xD;
      development will also be matched by improvements in postoperative endoscopic sinus scoring,&#xD;
      and patient's overall symptoms at 1 and 3 months postoperatively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study can clarify the efficacy of postoperative debridement and the potential benefits&#xD;
      of further reduced synechiae formation and edema, and thus decrease the rates of complication&#xD;
      and revision surgery. Conversely, if objective evidence fails to demonstrate benefit of&#xD;
      postoperative debridement, there could be significant cost and time saving for healthcare&#xD;
      professionals in removing this therapy from the postoperative protocols.&#xD;
