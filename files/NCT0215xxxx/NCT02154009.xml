      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - The autonomic nervous system helps control things that happen automatically in the body,&#xD;
      like blood pressure, heart rate, and digestion. When it doesn t work properly, it s called&#xD;
      dysautonomia. Researchers want to learn more about dysautonomias and train doctors to learn&#xD;
      how to better diagnose them.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To allow people with autonomic disorders to be evaluated.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To help fellows in the NIH Autonomic Disorders fellowship program see a variety of&#xD;
           diseases in their training.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  People age 18 and older with dysautonomia; children over age 2 if they might benefit&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Healthy adult volunteers&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will have different procedures depending on their symptoms. They will have&#xD;
           one or more visits. They will have some but not all of the tests below.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will have a medical history and physical exam. They may be tested for&#xD;
           problems thinking. They may complete a symptom questionnaire. They may have their&#xD;
           temperature and blood pressure taken.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants may have an intravenous line placed. A needle will guide a thin plastic&#xD;
           tube into an arm vein.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants may have blood drawn several times. They may give a urine sample.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants may have an electrocardiogram.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  How much blood a participant s heart is pumping and/or how much blood is flowing through&#xD;
           their arm may be measured. The total amount of blood in their bloodstream may be&#xD;
           measured.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants may have their ability to sweat and/or sense of smell tested.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Breathing, bowel sounds, and/or body functions may be monitored.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pupil size, response to environmental temperature changes, and/or breathing may be&#xD;
           measured.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants may have a bladder ultrasound.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Small pieces of skin may be taken for study.&#xD;

      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This Protocol is to facilitate training of Fellows in evaluation of clinical disorders of the&#xD;
      autonomic nervous system. The training is necessary to enable Fellows to sit for and pass the&#xD;
      certifying examination in autonomic disorders administered by the United Council for&#xD;
      Neurologic Subspecialties (UCNS) and to maintain UCNS accreditation of the Fellowship. A&#xD;
      secondary objective is to include results of evaluations and testing with those from other&#xD;
      Protocols, for future data analyses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Referred patients with known or suspected abnormalities of one or more components of the&#xD;
      autonomic nervous system and healthy adult volunteers. Volunteers will be studied for Fellows&#xD;
      to practice and gain normative values for pupillometric function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical physiologic, neuropharmacologic, and neurochemical testing will be performed during&#xD;
      outpatient clinic visits or during inpatient admissions, depending on the individual testing&#xD;
      schedule. Inpatient testing may be done in conjunction with other Protocols (e.g.,&#xD;
      03-N-0004). Most of the testing under this Protocol can be completed in a single outpatient&#xD;
      visit over the course of a workday. Testing procedures under this Protocol will be performed&#xD;
      as needed for adequate Fellow training. In addition to autonomic medical history and physical&#xD;
      examination, clinical testing procedures may include (A) monitoring of hemodynamics,&#xD;
      sweating, and other physiologic parameters associated with the Valsalva maneuver,&#xD;
      orthostasis, or external temperature manipulation; (B) venous blood sampling for assays of&#xD;
      levels of catecholamines and related neurochemicals; (C) administration of autonomic test&#xD;
      drugs; (D) skin biopsies; (E) blood volume measurement; (F) pupillometry; (G)&#xD;
      gastrointestinal phonography; (H) urinary bladder ultrasound; and (I) neurobehavioral rating&#xD;
      scales.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome measures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main outcome measure is competency in clinical and laboratory evaluation of autonomic&#xD;
      disorders, based on assessment of the Fellow by the Principal Investigator at approximately&#xD;
      6-month intervals. A secondary outcome measure is results obtained under this Protocol, which&#xD;
      may be analyzed and reported as research data along with data from other Protocols.&#xD;

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA - PATIENTS:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients may be included if they are at least 18 years old and are known or suspected to&#xD;
        have failure of one or more components of the autonomic nervous system, small fiber&#xD;
        neuropathy, inherited dysautonomia, orthostatic intolerance, neurocardiogenic syncope,&#xD;
        status post endoscopic thoracic sympathectomy, or disorders of catecholamine synthesis or&#xD;
        fate.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Children greater than two years old may be enrolled in this Protocol if they might&#xD;
        personally benefit from the tests in the Protocol through the establishment of a diagnosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA - PATIENTS:&#xD;
&#xD;
        There are no exclusion criteria for the study as a whole.&#xD;
&#xD;
        INCLUSION CRITERIA - HEALTHY VOLUNTEERS:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Healthy adult Volunteers (at least 18 years old) may be included, pending normal or&#xD;
        medically insignificant results of history and physical examination. A repeat history and&#xD;
        physical examination is required if more than 6 months have gone by from a previous workup.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA - HEALTHY VOLUNTEERS:&#xD;
&#xD;
        A candidate Healthy Volunteer will be excluded if the person has any of the following:&#xD;
        symptoms of autonomic dysfunction, including lightheadedness, fainting, abnormalities of&#xD;
        sweating, frequent nausea, vomiting, constipation, or diarrhea, or urinary frequency or&#xD;
        retention. If the Volunteer has a condition requiring medication that in the judgment of&#xD;
        the Investigators will affect results of the pupillometric tests under this Protocol, the&#xD;
        Volunteer may be included for training purposes.&#xD;
