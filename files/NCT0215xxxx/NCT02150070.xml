  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics (PK)&#xD;
      after intravenous (IV) administration of ASP2408 manufactured from a new production clone and&#xD;
      also following single ascending doses of subcutaneous (SC) injections of the same clinical&#xD;
      trial material.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The four doses will be studied in sequential cohorts of 8 subjects each, starting with the IV&#xD;
      dose, followed by the subcutaneous doses in ascending order of dose. Within each cohort,&#xD;
      subjects will be randomized to either active drug or matching placebo in a 3:1 ratio (6&#xD;
      active and 2 placebo).&#xD;
&#xD;
      All subjects in each arm will be confined for 8 days and followed for a minimum of 90 days up&#xD;
      to 9 months if necessary. Subjects who have study drug terminated should remain in the study,&#xD;
      if possible and have scheduled procedures and follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects who have detectable blood levels of ASP2408 after Day 90 will be unblinded and&#xD;
      followed monthly until ASP2408 levels are below the limit of quantification. In addition,&#xD;
      subjects who have persistent anti-ASP2408 antibodies after Day 90 will be unblinded and&#xD;
      followed every 30 (± 3) days for up to 9 months until the level of these antibodies are&#xD;
      declining, no longer detectable, and/or have no clinical consequence.&#xD;
