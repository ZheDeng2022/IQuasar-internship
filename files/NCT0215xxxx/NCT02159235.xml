      The present study aims is to investigate:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. whether patients suffering from acute resp. chronic ischemic heart disease show higher&#xD;
           levels for cadmium (Cd), lead (Pb) and mercury (Hg) than local and international&#xD;
           reference levels suggest;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. the correlation between severity of coronary artery disease and angiogenic and&#xD;
           angiostatic factors (endostatin-ES, angiostatin-AS, VEGF-vascular endothelial growth&#xD;
           factor, osteopontin-OPN) The patient population consists of about 270 female and male&#xD;
           patients suffering either acute or chronic ischemic heart disease (AIHD:ICD-10 I21;&#xD;
           CIHD: ICD-10 I25).&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. whether patients suffering CAD and valve calcification (mitral annulus, aortic valve)&#xD;
           show higher levels of endostatin, angiostatin, osteopontin and VEGF compared to patients&#xD;
           with CAD but without valve (annulus) calcification The measurement of cadmium (urine),&#xD;
           lead, mercury, zinc, endostatin, angiostatin, VEGF (serum) and osteopontin (plasma) in&#xD;
           patients with angiographically verified coronary artery disease are in the fore.&#xD;
           Furthermore, basic laboratory diagnostics as well as data from coronary angiography and&#xD;
           echocardiography will be collected. Additionally, the investigators will inquire heavy&#xD;
           metal exposition during life by an interview.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment will be done during the in-patient stay at the General Hospital of Vienna,&#xD;
      Medical University of Vienna.&#xD;

      Patients with angiographically verified CAD of different severity were recruited at the&#xD;
      Department of Cardiology, Medical University of Vienna. Detailed anamnestic and clinical data&#xD;
      was collected incl. cardiovascular risk factor assessment, medication, ECG&#xD;
      (electrocardiogram), routine laboratory parameters, echocardiography and all patients&#xD;
      underwent an coronary angiography for diagnostic and/or therapeutic reasons on grounds of&#xD;
      their underlying disease. The coronary artery system was divided into 17 segments and&#xD;
      stenosis grade for each segment was measured. The segments were: left main,&#xD;
      proximal/medial/distal LAD (lad left anterior descending artery), ramus circumflex, first and&#xD;
      second marginal branch, posterolateral branch, first and second diagonal branch,&#xD;
      proximal/medial/distal LCX (lcx left circumflex artery), proximal/medial/distal RCA (right&#xD;
      coronary artery), ramus interventricular posterior and stenosis grade for each segment was&#xD;
      measured. A simple 3-point-grading system (&quot;Coronary Score&quot;) was developed considering both&#xD;
      frequency and severity of CAD: 0 points for non-stenosed or only calcified segments, 1 point&#xD;
      for each stenosis from &lt;30-&lt;50 %, 2 points for each stenosis from 50-&lt;70 % and 3 points for&#xD;
      each stenosis &gt;70 %. Blood samples for determination of ES, AS and VEGF levels were taken at&#xD;
      least two days before or after an acute event (angina pectoris, STEMI-ST-elevation myocardial&#xD;
      infarction, NSTEM-Non ST-elevation myocardial infarction) or an invasive intervention&#xD;
      (angiography). ES, AS and VEGF were analysed in serum, OPN in plasma by ELISA-Enzyme Linked&#xD;
      Immunosorbent Assay according to the instructions of the manufacturer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Echocardiography was performed to evaluate left and right ventricular function (multiple&#xD;
      cross-sectional views), valve insufficiency/stenosis/calcification and wall movement&#xD;
      disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hg and Pb levels were measured in full-blood, Cd in urine. The outcrop of full-blood samples&#xD;
      for the determination of Pb and Hg was done by 2 ml ultrapure water and 2 ml nitric acid (68%&#xD;
      sub-boiled). The sample aliquot was 0,5 ml, backfilling volume 20 ml. The determination of Pb&#xD;
      and Cd was performed by ICPMS (inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry) according to the&#xD;
      ÖNORM EN ISO 17294-2. The determination of Hg was done by AFS (atomic fluorescence&#xD;
      spectroscopy) according to the ÖNORM EN 17852. The outcrop of urine samples for the&#xD;
      determination of Cd was done by 2 ml ultrapure water and 2 ml nitric acid (68% sub-boiled).&#xD;
      The sample aliquot was 5 ml, backfilling volume 20 ml. The detection/quantification limits&#xD;
      were 0,40/2 μg/l (Pb), 0,067/0,13 μg/l (Hg) and 0,12/0,40 μg/l (Cd). In case the&#xD;
      quantification limit was undercut, the following expected amounts were used: Cd: 0,3 μg/l,&#xD;
      Pb: 1 μg/l, Hg: 0,1 μg/l. In case of Cd and Hg Human-Biomonitoring (HBM)-I and II levels and&#xD;
      in case of Pb reference levels from the German Environmental Agency.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physical activity of the patients was defined/quantified as non physical activity, walking&#xD;
      less 3h/week, walking more than 3 hours/week, sports less than 3 hours/week and sports more&#xD;
      than 3 hours/week.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis was done with SPSS 20.0. Continuous and normally distributed data is&#xD;
      described by means ± standard deviation (SD) and group differences are tested by independent&#xD;
      sample t-test and correlation were calculated using Pearson's correlation coefficient.&#xD;
      Continuous data with skew distribution or outliers is described ny median, first and third&#xD;
      quartile and minimum and maximum. Group differences are tested by Mann-Whitney-U-test and&#xD;
      correlations were calculated using Spearman's correlation coefficient. For data with values&#xD;
      below the quantification limit a value below quantification limit was imputed (the same value&#xD;
      for all these observations) and the non-parametric Mann-Whitney-U-test was used. All tests&#xD;
      are performed two-sided and p-values ≤ 0,05 were considered significant. The protocol was&#xD;
      approved by the Ethical Commission of the Medical University of Vienna and informed consent&#xD;
      was obtained from patients.&#xD;
