    <textblock>
      This project will study 40 Veterans identified with symptoms understood to characterize mild&#xD;
      to moderate Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) including Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD).&#xD;
      Following screening and informed consent, Veterans will be randomly assigned to treatment&#xD;
      with repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (rTMS) or sham rTMS (placebo). Additional&#xD;
      examinations will compare brain imaging (structural and functional MRI scans at rest) across&#xD;
      participants at baseline, after acute rTMS treatment, and at 6 month followup. The VA&#xD;
      population differs significantly from populations that have been included in prior trials of&#xD;
      rTMS for many conditions such as depression, chronic pain, and PTSD. Many returning Operation&#xD;
      Enduring Freedom (OEF)/Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF) personnel and Veterans with concussion&#xD;
      histories report cognitive problems, such as impaired attention, verbal fluency, poor&#xD;
      planning, reduced working memory, and mental flexibility. The investigators hope to show the&#xD;
      efficacy and durability of rTMS in treating these symptoms safely in Veterans with&#xD;
      co-morbidities.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The goal of the present study is to evaluate the efficacy and durability of benefits of&#xD;
      repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (rTMS) as a promising non-invasive therapeutic&#xD;
      treatment for executive function deficits reported in Veterans with mild to moderate&#xD;
      Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) patients. Although much progress has been made towards&#xD;
      understanding the various deficits following TBI, progress has yet to be made towards&#xD;
      identifying and assessing therapeutic treatment options that are responsive to TBI symptoms.&#xD;
      Many returning OEF/OIF Veterans with concussion histories report cognitive symptoms that may&#xD;
      last for months or years, and affect every day function. Symptoms faced by Veterans with mild&#xD;
      to moderate TBI include executive function deficits such as impaired attention (including&#xD;
      shifting sets), verbal fluency, poor planning, reduced working memory, and mental&#xD;
      flexibility. The primary objective is to assess the efficacy of rTMS in Veterans with mild to&#xD;
      moderate TBI in improving executive functioning.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A recent VA study reported improvements in PTSD and related symptoms in Veterans with PTSD&#xD;
      who received rTMS (Watts et al., 2012). Repetitive TMS is a method of delivering therapeutic,&#xD;
      non-invasive brain stimulation that is currently being used at the VA Palo Alto and Stanford&#xD;
      University in a number of clinical trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For this pilot study the investigators propose to enroll 40 Veterans diagnosed with mild to&#xD;
      moderate TBI (age range 20-65). Inclusion Criteria: mild and moderate TBI will be defined as:&#xD;
      post-traumatic amnesia (PTA &lt; 1 day for mild; 1 day&gt; x &lt; 7days for moderate). Because of the&#xD;
      extensively documented co-occurrence of TBI with PTSD, (Veterans with TBI with and without&#xD;
      PTSD will be enrolled). PTSD will be assessed using standard clinical measures. Exclusionary&#xD;
      criteria: patients will be screened for TMS and MRI safety. The duration of the study will be&#xD;
      two years, with a 1.5 year enrollment period, and a final half-year of follow-up completion.&#xD;
      Following a preliminary telephone screen, Veterans will be scheduled for onsite informed&#xD;
      consent, screening, and baseline assessments. Using an electronic randomization form,&#xD;
      participants will be enrolled into two groups: active rTMS or sham rTMS. As this is a double&#xD;
      blind placebo controlled study, only the subject ID number is provided to the nurse&#xD;
      administrating the rTMS treatment. After randomization, the rTMS nurse will test the motor&#xD;
      threshold (MT) for rTMS. Each participant will be in the trial for a total of approximately&#xD;
      (28) weeks: 1-2 weeks screening, (2) weeks acute treatment phase (including MRI pre and post&#xD;
      rTMS) and 24 weeks (6 month) follow-up phase (with MRI, neuropsychological testing and&#xD;
      self-report measures). Left Dorsolateral Prefrontal Cortex (DLPFC) will be the stimulation&#xD;
      site as it is shown to be affective in treatment of depression and approved by FDA. All&#xD;
      participants will receive a minimum of 20 treatments before being evaluated for change in&#xD;
      executive function (primary outcome measure).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary hypothesis is that Veterans receiving active rTMS will show improvement more than&#xD;
      sham treated Veterans in (performance between baseline and last assessment of &gt;1 SD on either&#xD;
      the Trail Making Test part B, Delis-Kaplan Executive Function System [D-KEFS] Verbal Fluency&#xD;
      and/or D-KEFS Color-Word Interference Test). Additional analysis will include: Sustained&#xD;
      Improvement on executive function composite score; secondary consequences of TBI scores on&#xD;
      Quality of Life (QOL) scale, moderators of response such as age, severity of symptoms at&#xD;
      baseline, type of comorbidity (e.g., PTSD); and, functional brain activity changes with rTMS&#xD;
      treatment. This pilot study will be one of the first to demonstrate rTMS as a treatment for&#xD;
      executive function deficit in Veterans with mild to moderate TBI. Additionally, it would also&#xD;
      report on the efficacy of using functional MRI (fMRI) as a biomarker to capture this&#xD;
      improvement in executive function.&#xD;

    <description>The primary hypothesis is that Veterans receiving active rTMS will show improvement more than sham treated Veterans in performance between baseline and last assessment of &gt;1 SD on the Trail Making Test part B. This test is known for its accurate assessment of executive function in mild and moderate TBI.&#xD;
The TMT is a timed test and the goal is to complete the test as accurately and as quickly as possible. Raw scores are reported in seconds to complete the test. For Part B, an average score is 75 seconds and a deficient score is greater than 273 seconds.&#xD;
The present study reports T-scores, which can range from a minimum of 0 and a maximum of 100. The higher the T- score achieved by a participant, the better the performance, indicating a higher level of functioning.</description>

    <description>The Veterans RAND 36 Item Health Survey (VR-36Â©) is a brief, generic, multi-use, self-administered health surveys comprised of 36 items The instruments are primarily used to measure health-related quality of life, to estimate disease burden and to evaluate disease-specific impact on general and selected populations. The items on the questionnaire correspond to eight principal health domains including general health perceptions, physical functioning, role limitations due to physical and emotional problems, bodily pain, energy-fatigue , social functioning and mental health. higher scores mean better health and depicted in percentages. This scale would show significantly greater improvement in patients with mild to moderate TBI who received rTMS treatment.&#xD;

    <time_frame>post treatment (2 weeks) and 6-months</time_frame>
    <description>Each participant went under an MRI scan at post treatment (2 weeks) and 6-months. Functional MRI measures the Blood Oxygen Level Dependent (BOLD) signal in the brain and it can change with this brain stimulation. One common way to address this change or response to treatment is to measure the connectivity between BOLD signal of a network, such as the established default mode network, with the stimulation site. This is provided as a correlation value between the two points- and the strength of correlation is used for each participant at each time point to see if any change has occurred due to stimulation (active vs. placebo). Beta Values are provided below.</description>

        <title>Trail Making Test Part B</title>
        <description>The primary hypothesis is that Veterans receiving active rTMS will show improvement more than sham treated Veterans in performance between baseline and last assessment of &gt;1 SD on the Trail Making Test part B. This test is known for its accurate assessment of executive function in mild and moderate TBI.&#xD;
The TMT is a timed test and the goal is to complete the test as accurately and as quickly as possible. Raw scores are reported in seconds to complete the test. For Part B, an average score is 75 seconds and a deficient score is greater than 273 seconds.&#xD;
The present study reports T-scores, which can range from a minimum of 0 and a maximum of 100. The higher the T- score achieved by a participant, the better the performance, indicating a higher level of functioning.</description>

        <description>The Veterans RAND 36 Item Health Survey (VR-36Â©) is a brief, generic, multi-use, self-administered health surveys comprised of 36 items The instruments are primarily used to measure health-related quality of life, to estimate disease burden and to evaluate disease-specific impact on general and selected populations. The items on the questionnaire correspond to eight principal health domains including general health perceptions, physical functioning, role limitations due to physical and emotional problems, bodily pain, energy-fatigue , social functioning and mental health. higher scores mean better health and depicted in percentages. This scale would show significantly greater improvement in patients with mild to moderate TBI who received rTMS treatment.&#xD;
Outcome variable description: Scores for each domain are from 0-100 with a higher score defining a more favorable health outcome.</description>

        <title>Treatment Induced Change in Functional Connectivity</title>
        <description>Each participant went under an MRI scan at post treatment (2 weeks) and 6-months. Functional MRI measures the Blood Oxygen Level Dependent (BOLD) signal in the brain and it can change with this brain stimulation. One common way to address this change or response to treatment is to measure the connectivity between BOLD signal of a network, such as the established default mode network, with the stimulation site. This is provided as a correlation value between the two points- and the strength of correlation is used for each participant at each time point to see if any change has occurred due to stimulation (active vs. placebo). Beta Values are provided below.</description>
