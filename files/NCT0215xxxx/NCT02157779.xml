  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Excessive and poorly controlled anger is one of the most common problems experienced by war&#xD;
      Veterans. The consequences can be severe, including increased risk for divorce, domestic&#xD;
      violence, job loss and instability, and other serious impairments in family, social, and&#xD;
      occupational functioning. Availability of effective treatments is critical to reducing the&#xD;
      adverse effects of anger in Veterans. The investigators propose to conduct a controlled study&#xD;
      to determine whether a cognitive behavior treatment that has been adapted for treating anger&#xD;
      problems in Veterans of Iraq and Afghanistan results in improved outcomes compared to a&#xD;
      supportive therapy. Results will be examined for improvement in anger, functioning, and&#xD;
      quality of life at end of 12 weekly sessions, and at 3 and 6 months following treatment.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Poorly controlled anger is a common problem with often devastating effects in Veterans who&#xD;
      have served in a warzone. Adverse consequences include increased risk for divorce, domestic&#xD;
      violence, job loss and instability, and other serious impairments in family, social, and&#xD;
      occupational functioning. Recent evidence indicates that anger and aggression are likely to&#xD;
      be problems for a significant proportion of Veterans of Iraq (Operation Iraqi Freedom, OIF;&#xD;
      Operation New Dawn, OND) and Afghanistan (Operation Enduring Freedom, OEF). A survey of&#xD;
      reintegration problems among 754 OEF/OIF combat Veterans receiving VA Medical care showed&#xD;
      that anger was the most commonly reported problem, with 57% reporting increased problems in&#xD;
      controlling anger. Despite encouraging evidence for efficacy of cognitive behavioral&#xD;
      interventions in treating anger in civilian samples, much less is known about the efficacy of&#xD;
      such treatments for anger problems in military personnel following exposure to war zone&#xD;
      trauma. Promising preliminary findings for individually based cognitive behavioral treatment&#xD;
      have been reported, and there is evidence that a group anger management treatment delivered&#xD;
      by teleconferencing is as effective as the same treatment delivered in person, but to date&#xD;
      there is not a single adequately powered randomized trial designed to test the efficacy of an&#xD;
      anger treatment compared to an active control condition in Veterans. Building on findings&#xD;
      from the investigators' randomized pilot study, the objective of the current proposal is to&#xD;
      conduct a randomized clinical trial with sufficient statistical power to test the&#xD;
      effectiveness of a manualized cognitive behavioral intervention (CBI) that has been adapted&#xD;
      from an existing treatment (Anger Control Therapy; Novaco, 1994, 2001) for the treatment of&#xD;
      anger problems in OEF/OIF/OND Veterans, compared to a manualized supportive therapy&#xD;
      intervention (SI) control condition. Ninety OEF/OIF/OND Veterans reporting significant&#xD;
      problems with anger will be randomized to receive 12 individual sessions of one of the two&#xD;
      study conditions. Outcomes including measures of anger and aggression; interpersonal, social&#xD;
      and occupational functioning; and quality of life will be assessed during and at the end of&#xD;
      treatment and at 3 and 6 month follow-ups. Exploratory analyses will examine 1) whether a&#xD;
      diagnosis of PTSD impacts treatment effectiveness and 2) potential mediators of treatment&#xD;
      outcome with CBI.&#xD;

    <measure>Least Squares Mean Anger Expression Index Score on the State Trait Anger Inventory 2 (STAXI-2) Using a Repeated Measures ANCOVA Adjusted for Baseline and Time Effects</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Weeks 4, 8,12, 3 and 6 months post-treatment</time_frame>
    <description>The STAXI-2 is a revision of Spielberger's State-Trait Anger Expression Inventory (STAXI), expanded from 44 to 57 items. It is a self-report questionnaire consisting of six scales and an Anger Expression Index (AX). Scales include State Anger, Trait Anger, Anger Expression-Out, Anger Expression-In, Anger Control-Out and Anger Expression-In. The Anger Expression Index is an overall measure of the expression and control of anger based on responses to the two anger expression and the two anger control subscales. Minimum and Maximum Values range from 0 to 96, higher scores mean more anger.</description>

    <measure>Least Squares Mean Total Score on the Outcomes Questionnaire (OQ) Using a Repeated Measures ANCOVA Adjusted for Baseline Scores and Time Effects</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 12 weeks, 3 and 6 months post-treatment</time_frame>
    <description>The OQ is a self report measure that assesses functioning and includes three subscales: symptom distress, interpersonal relations, and social role functioning. Concurrent validity has been demonstrated in relation to internal consistency and reliability. Additionally, the OQ has been shown to be fairly stable in untreated individuals and sensitive to change in those individuals in treatment. Minimum and Maximum Values range from 0 to 180, higher scores mean worse functioning.</description>

    <measure>Least Squares Mean Psychological Domain Score on the WHO Quality of Life (WHOQOL) Using a Repeated Measures ANCOVA Adjusted for Baseline Scores and Time Effects</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 12 weeks (end of treatment), 3 and 6 months post-treatment</time_frame>
    <description>The World Health Organization Quality of Life (WHOQOL-BREF), is 26 item self-report measure used to assess quality of life in multiple domains (i.e., physical, psychological, social, and environment). Psychometric properties suggest that the measure is valid and reliable across cultures and nations. Ratings are made on a 5 point scale. The psychological subscale, which consists of 6 items, was used in this study. Minimum and Maximum Values for the psychological domain range from 6 to 30, higher scores mean better quality of life.</description>

    <measure>Least Squares Mean PTSD Severity Score on the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS) for DSM-5 Using a Repeated Measures ANCOVA Adjusted for Baseline Scores and Time Effects</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline,12 weeks (end of treatment), 3 and 6 months post-treatment</time_frame>
    <description>The CAPS-5 (updated for DSM-5) is a clinician administered structured interview for the assessment of DSM-5 PTSD. The CAPS has excellent reliability and validity and is widely used in PTSD treatment research. Each one of the DSM-5 PTSD symptoms is rated on a 0-4 (low to high) scale to determine symptom severity. The cutoff used to establish the presence of an individual symptom is a score of 2 or greater. Overall PTSD severity is computed by summing the totals for all items. Minimum and Maximum Values range from 0 to 80, higher scores mean higher levels of symptomatology.</description>

    <measure>Least Squares Mean Total Score on the Anger Consequences Questionnaire (ACQ) Using a Repeated Measures ANCOVA Adjusted for Baseline Scores and Time Effects</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 12, 3 and 6 months Post-treatment</time_frame>
    <description>The ACQ is a brief self-report measure developed to assess the frequency of negative anger-related behavioral consequences. Internal consistencies of .75 to .91 have been reported. This scale includes items not covered by the other anger measures, including for example, trouble with the law, driving recklessly, getting into an accident, damaging relationships, etc. There are 50 items; minimum and maximum Values range from 0 to 200. Higher scores means more anger.</description>

        <title>Least Squares Mean Anger Expression Index Score on the State Trait Anger Inventory 2 (STAXI-2) Using a Repeated Measures ANCOVA Adjusted for Baseline and Time Effects</title>
        <description>The STAXI-2 is a revision of Spielberger's State-Trait Anger Expression Inventory (STAXI), expanded from 44 to 57 items. It is a self-report questionnaire consisting of six scales and an Anger Expression Index (AX). Scales include State Anger, Trait Anger, Anger Expression-Out, Anger Expression-In, Anger Control-Out and Anger Expression-In. The Anger Expression Index is an overall measure of the expression and control of anger based on responses to the two anger expression and the two anger control subscales. Minimum and Maximum Values range from 0 to 96, higher scores mean more anger.</description>
        <time_frame>Baseline, Weeks 4, 8,12, 3 and 6 months post-treatment</time_frame>
        <population>Participants were randomly assigned to CBI or SI. Those with one or more post-baseline assessments were included in Hierarchical Linear Model (HLM) analyses. Not all participants had post-baseline data; some treatment noncompleters had one or more post-baseline assessments. Least Square Means and differences adjusted for baseline and time effects from repeated measures ANCOVA are shown.

          <title>Least Squares Mean Global Work Functioning Score on the Longitudinal Interval Follow-up Evaluation (LIFE) Using a Repeated Measures ANCOVA Adjusted for Baseline Scores and Time Effects</title>
          <description>Psychosocial functioning scales from the clinician administered Longitudinal Interval Follow-up Evaluation (LIFE) provides assessment of functioning in areas of work (employment, household, or student), various aspects of interpersonal functioning, recreation, satisfaction and global social adjustment. Ratings are based on the past month. The psychosocial functioning ratings have been found to be of generally high reliability. Minimum and Maximum Values for the work functioning global score range from 1 to 5, higher scores mean worse functioning.</description>
          <population>Participants were randomly assigned to CBI or SI. Those with at least one post-baseline measure (12 wk (end of treatment), 3 mo f/u, and/or 6 mo f/u) were included in HLM analysis. Not all had post-baseline data, and some who didn't complete treatment had one or more post-baseline assessments. Least Square means and differences adjusted for baseline and time effects from repeated measures ANCOVA are shown. Full Information Maximum Likelihood was used to account for missing data.</population>

        <title>Least Squares Mean Psychological Domain Score on the WHO Quality of Life (WHOQOL) Using a Repeated Measures ANCOVA Adjusted for Baseline Scores and Time Effects</title>
        <description>The World Health Organization Quality of Life (WHOQOL-BREF), is 26 item self-report measure used to assess quality of life in multiple domains (i.e., physical, psychological, social, and environment). Psychometric properties suggest that the measure is valid and reliable across cultures and nations. Ratings are made on a 5 point scale. The psychological subscale, which consists of 6 items, was used in this study. Minimum and Maximum Values for the psychological domain range from 6 to 30, higher scores mean better quality of life.</description>

        <title>Least Squares Mean PTSD Severity Score on the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS) for DSM-5 Using a Repeated Measures ANCOVA Adjusted for Baseline Scores and Time Effects</title>
        <description>The CAPS-5 (updated for DSM-5) is a clinician administered structured interview for the assessment of DSM-5 PTSD. The CAPS has excellent reliability and validity and is widely used in PTSD treatment research. Each one of the DSM-5 PTSD symptoms is rated on a 0-4 (low to high) scale to determine symptom severity. The cutoff used to establish the presence of an individual symptom is a score of 2 or greater. Overall PTSD severity is computed by summing the totals for all items. Minimum and Maximum Values range from 0 to 80, higher scores mean higher levels of symptomatology.</description>

        <description>The ACQ is a brief self-report measure developed to assess the frequency of negative anger-related behavioral consequences. Internal consistencies of .75 to .91 have been reported. This scale includes items not covered by the other anger measures, including for example, trouble with the law, driving recklessly, getting into an accident, damaging relationships, etc. There are 50 items; minimum and maximum Values range from 0 to 200. Higher scores means more anger.</description>

          <description>The ACQ is a brief self-report measure developed to assess the frequency of negative anger-related behavioral consequences. Internal consistencies of .75 to .91 have been reported. This scale includes items not covered by the other anger measures, including for example, trouble with the law, driving recklessly, getting into an accident, damaging relationships, etc. There are 50 items; minimum and maximum Values range from 0 to 200. Higher scores means more anger.</description>
          <population>Participants were randomly assigned to CBI or SI. Those with one or more post-baseline assessments (week 12, 3- and/or 6-month follow-up) were included in HLM analyses. Not all participants had post-baseline data, and some who didn't complete treatment had one or more post-baseline assessments. Least Square means and differences adjusted for baseline and time effects from repeated measures ANCOVA are shown.

        <description>The OAS-M is a structured interview that assesses frequency of anger and aggression. The verbal assault subscale measures the frequency and severity of verbal assaults over the previous week. Minimum and Maximum Values range from 0 to no maximum, higher scores means more anger.</description>

The Anger Expression Out (AX-O) subscale measures how often angry feelings are expressed in verbally or physically aggressive behavior. It consists of 8 items, with a subscale range of 8 to 32. Higher scores indicate higher levels of expressed anger.</description>
        <time_frame>Baseline, weeks 4, 8, 12 (post-treatment), 3 and 6 month post-treatment</time_frame>
        <population>Participants were randomly assigned to CBI or SI. Those with at least one post-baseline measure (4 wk, 8wk,12 wk (end of tx), 3 mo and/or 6 mo f/u) were included in HLM analysis. Not all had post-baseline data, and some who didn't complete treatment had one or more post-baseline assessments. Least Square means and differences adjusted for baseline and time effects from repeated measures ANCOVA are shown. Full Information Maximum Likelihood was used to account for missing data.</population>
