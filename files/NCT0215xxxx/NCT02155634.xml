    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to see how long lenalidomide therapy can maintain or improve the&#xD;
      disease response obtained after induction therapy that does not include lenalidomide,&#xD;
      pomalidomide or thalidomide; and consequently reduce worsening of disease and to evaluate the&#xD;
      activity of lenalidomide. Patients will receive lenalidomide or be under observation. All&#xD;
      patients will attend regular clinic visits to evaluate their disease and health. Patients&#xD;
      will have the option to participate in additional biomarker correlative studies in addition&#xD;
      to their participation in the main study.&#xD;
