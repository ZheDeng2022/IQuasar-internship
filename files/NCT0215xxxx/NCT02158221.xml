      The investigators hypothesized that migraine without patients with many genetic loci&#xD;
      associated with migraine (high genetic load) would be more sensitive and get provoked more&#xD;
      migraine attacks by PACAP compared to patients with few genetic loci associated with migraine&#xD;
      (low genetic load).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Migraine is a very prevalent neurological disorder with a strong genetic factor. The common&#xD;
      forms of migraine have a multifactorial and polygenic pattern of inheritance and genetics&#xD;
      research is crucial for a deeper understanding of migraine mechanisms. Recently, 12 genetic&#xD;
      loci have been identified to be associated with migraine with (MA) and without aura (MA) in&#xD;
      four large genome-wide association studies (GWAS). The functional consequences of this&#xD;
      genetic variant in humans are yet unknown.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PACAP is a neuropeptide which plays a crucial role in the pathophysiology of migraine and is&#xD;
      present in migraine relevant structures. PACAP can induce migraine attacks in MO patients via&#xD;
      an adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) dependent pathway. Also, a recent study has showed that&#xD;
      intracellular accumulation of cAMP is crucial for the induction of migraine attacks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The phenotype of the migraine inducing effects of PACAP might therefore be linked to some of&#xD;
      the 12 genetic susceptibility loci that have been identified.&#xD;
