    <textblock>
      Nowadays these are some vaccines being vaccinated simultaneously, and a doubt is aroused if&#xD;
      the safety and immunogenicity are same between inoculating several vaccines simultaneously&#xD;
      and inoculating individually. So we carry out this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the difference of safety and immunogenicity on&#xD;
      vaccinating rotavirus vaccine simultaneously with measles-rubella vaccine(MR) or&#xD;
      measles-mumps-rubella vaccine(MMR) compared to vaccinating rotavirus vaccine, MR or MMR&#xD;
      individually.&#xD;

      1. Quality control plan:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. All vaccinators should get professional training held by local Health Bureau, and&#xD;
                be qualified by local Health Bureau.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. All the clinical trial related staffs are trained by provincial or prefectural&#xD;
                Center for Disease Control and prevention (CDC) at the beginning.&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Provincial and prefectural CDCs conduct supervision at each step, especially during&#xD;
                field vaccination and Adverse Events Following Immunization (AEFI) investigation.&#xD;
&#xD;
             4. Data valid check is designed to work in the database inputting, double entry and&#xD;
                validation is also required.&#xD;
&#xD;
             5. The field works are conduct under SOP (Standard Operating Procedures), The SOP for&#xD;
                vaccination procedures which include vaccinee recruitment and vaccination practice&#xD;
                etc. is 'Immunization Work Specification' issued by China Ministry of Health in&#xD;
                2005. The SOP for AEFI surveillance is 'AEFI surveillance guideline' issued by&#xD;
                China Ministry of Health in 2010.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Statistical plan&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Safety evaluation The analytic data include all reactions or events within 30 days&#xD;
                after vaccination, compare the incidence of reactions among different vaccines, the&#xD;
                statistical method is chi-square.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Immunogenicity evaluation Compare the antibody positive rate and Geometric Mean&#xD;
                Concentration between pre-vaccination and post-vaccination, and among different&#xD;
                vaccine combinations.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. safety evaluation method&#xD;
&#xD;
           At the time of vaccination, vaccinees were instructed to report any adverse event to&#xD;
           physicians or vaccination providers. Adverse events that were fatal or that resulted in&#xD;
           disability and clusters of events (i.e., notably high numbers of similar adverse events&#xD;
           related to a certain vaccine) were required to be reported within 2 hours after their&#xD;
           occurrence. The following adverse events were required to be reported within 2 days&#xD;
           after their occurrence: anaphylaxis or other allergic reactions occurring within 24&#xD;
           hours after vaccination; fever (axillary temperature, &gt;38.5°C), angioedema, or a local&#xD;
           injection-site reaction (diameter, &gt;2.5 cm) occurring within 5 days after vaccination;&#xD;
           purpura, an Arthus reaction, febrile convulsion, seizure, or polyneuritis occurring&#xD;
           within 15 days after vaccination. Other reactions that were common and minor (e.g., mild&#xD;
           pain and fatigue) were not required to be reported.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Immunogenicity evaluation&#xD;
&#xD;
      Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (abbreviated as ELSIA) is used to quantitatively test&#xD;
      immunoglobulin G (IgG) of measles, rubella, mumps, test kit is provided by Virion\Serion&#xD;
      company. Rotavirus Immunoglobulin A (RV-IgA) is used to test the antibody of rotavirus.&#xD;
