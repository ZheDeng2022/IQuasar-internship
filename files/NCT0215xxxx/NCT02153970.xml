      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Neuromuscular diseases (NMDs) do not have cures. But future treatments will try to improve&#xD;
      the health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in people with NMD. Computer questionnaires can&#xD;
      help test HRQoL in people with NMD. They could help clinicians and researchers know how&#xD;
      people with NMD and their caregivers are doing. They could also help show if treatments are&#xD;
      making a difference.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Researchers want to make sure two of these questionnaires PROMIS (Patient Reported Outcomes&#xD;
      Measurement Information System) and Neuro-QOL (Quality of Life in Neurological Disorders)&#xD;
      work the same way every time. They also want to make sure the questionnaires test the same&#xD;
      things every time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To make sure the PROMIS and Neuro-QOL questionnaires are valid.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Children age 8 17 who have NMD. Also, caregivers of children age 5 17 who have NMD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will complete the PROMIS and Neuro-QOL questionnaires on a computer. The&#xD;
           caregiver and child versions are not the same.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will complete the questionnaires at the beginning of the study. It will&#xD;
           take about 15 20 minutes. They will complete the questionnaires again after 2 4 weeks.&#xD;
           They may receive phone or email reminders.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will complete the questionnaires at the NIH outpatient clinic and/or on&#xD;
           their own device. At NIH, they will use a computer or tablet.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Health-related quality of life (HRQoL) is defined as an individual s perception of his or her&#xD;
      well-being and satisfaction with their current circumstances. As is oftentimes the case, in&#xD;
      childhood-onset neuromuscular disease (NMD) and cerebral palsy (CP), no definitive cures&#xD;
      currently exist. As a result, the primary goal of treatment for these patient populations is&#xD;
      to improve quality of life or, more specifically, HRQoL. The medical community s interest in&#xD;
      patient-based outcomes such as HRQoL has increased in the last two decades as it allows a&#xD;
      multidimensional consideration of a patient s health. This focus has been the impetus for the&#xD;
      development of computerized adaptive testing (CAT) instruments such as Quality of Life in&#xD;
      Neurological Disorders (Neuro-QOL) and Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Information&#xD;
      System (PROMIS) to provide a means of assessing quality of life in patient populations with&#xD;
      chronic diseases, such as neuromuscular disease and cerebral palsy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this study is thus to validate the PROMIS and Neuro-QOL scales pediatric&#xD;
      domains of self-assessment for individuals with CP and NMD and the PROMIS proxy domains for&#xD;
      proxy-assessment of the same populations. The questionnaires will be administered to a&#xD;
      combined total of 650 individuals from two sites in order to also calibrate the items and&#xD;
      convert the questionnaires into CAT format.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study population is patients with CP or NMD, ages 8-17 years, caregivers of patients with&#xD;
      CP or NMD, whose children are ages 5-17 years. Caregivers are defined in this study as&#xD;
      parents or legal guardians of children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      &lt;TAB&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
      The design is a prospective study in which patients and caregivers will complete online&#xD;
      versions of the PROMIS and Neuro-QOL questionnaires at one of two different sites.&#xD;
&#xD;
      &lt;TAB&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
      The outcome measures are the responses to the questionnaires.&#xD;
&#xD;
      &lt;TAB&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
      The validation of self-report and proxy-report questionnaires for use in the pediatric&#xD;
      population with childhood-onset disease, specifically CP and NMD, will serve as an adjunct to&#xD;
      the clinical exam and provide a way for clinicians and researchers to track the effectiveness&#xD;
      of regular care and surgical interventions in these populations. The ultimate goal is to&#xD;
      produce reliable, validated assessments of HRQoL in these populations via the CAT testing&#xD;
      format with the potential to use these tools to inform both clinical decision-making and&#xD;
      further research efforts for patients.&#xD;
