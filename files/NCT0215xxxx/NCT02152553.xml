  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators have shown that patients with adrenal insufficiency (Addison's disease), a&#xD;
      rare disorder, have doubled the expected mortality rate in Sweden despite Standard of Care&#xD;
      glucocorticoid (GC) replacement. One % of the Swedish population are, however, receiving GCs&#xD;
      for inflammatory diseases, but management is empirical and adjusted to underlying disease&#xD;
      activity. The desired anti-inflammatory therapeutic effects cannot be differentiated from the&#xD;
      adverse metabolic (osteoporosis, obesity, diabetes mellitus) and immunosuppressive side&#xD;
      effects of GC. This frequently results in suboptimal GC therapy with adverse effects due to&#xD;
      over-dosing or poor efficacy due to under-dosing. The primary aim is to identify a biomarker&#xD;
      for the metabolic effects of GCs. Patients with Addison's disease completely lack endogenous&#xD;
      GCs and can therefore be considered a human GC knock-out model. They can therefore be studied&#xD;
      during near-physiological exposure and during GC starvation. This will uniquely allow a very&#xD;
      clean biomarker identification model (using transcriptomics, proteomics and metabolomics).&#xD;
      The secondary aim is to validate candidate biomarker(s) in a dose-response study using the&#xD;
      same patient population. A biomarker of GC actions will make it possible to individualised&#xD;
      therapy during pharmacological GC treatment. It would allow GC replacement to be monitored in&#xD;
      Addison's disease and could become a specific diagnostic tool in patients with GC deficiency&#xD;
      and excess (Cushings syndrome).&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Protein profile changes between a state of GC starvation and near physiological GC exposure.</measure>
    <time_frame>Changes in proteome (g/dl or umol/l) during 24 hours under two different states of GC exposure.</time_frame>
    <description>Using mass spectrometry, protein profile changes in blood, urine and adipose tissue are going to be identified between four points of time during two states: morning and midnight during near physiological GC exposure (sampling 1 and 2), morning and midnight during GC starvation (sampling 3 and 4). Quantitative measurements of all proteins will be used in the bioinformatic analysis. The bioinformatics strategic consists of a stepwise approach based on random forest analysis. Key features in the analysis include finding candidate markers that are increased during normal GC exposure (sampling 1 and 2), reduced during GC starvation (sampling 3 and 4) and exclusion of factors with high variability within normal subjects. Putative biomarkers will go through two levels of internal cross-validation. The investigators would like that this part of the project is not going to be public.</description>

    <description>Using array based transcriptomics (both mRNA &amp; miRNA), mRNA/miRNA profile changes in blood, urine and adipose tissue are going to be identified between four points of time during two states: morning and midnight during near physiological GC exposure (sampling 1 and 2), morning and midnight during GC starvation (sampling 3 and 4).
