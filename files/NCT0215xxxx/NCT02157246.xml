  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A low level of oxygen in cancer cells makes them less likely to respond to chemotherapy and&#xD;
      radiotherapy treatments. There is interest in using new drugs that improve the level of&#xD;
      oxygen in tumours. Another approach would be to increase the radiotherapy dose to tumours&#xD;
      with low oxygen levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before we can do this for patients with rectal cancer, we need to develop a reliable way of&#xD;
      identifying areas of low oxygen within the rectal tumour. This will make us able to tell&#xD;
      which patients may be suitable for such a change in their treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Traditionally, the level of oxygen in tumours is measured by inserting a needle into the&#xD;
      tumour and measuring it directly. This is not possible in rectal cancer. This study has been&#xD;
      designed to identify the best alternative method. We would like to do a blood test, take&#xD;
      samples of cancer tissue and some detailed scans (18F-fluoromisonidazole (F-MISO) positron&#xD;
      emission tomography, perfusion computed tomography, functional magnetic resonance imaging).&#xD;
      The results of these tests will be compared to decide which gives us the most comprehensive&#xD;
      and reliable information.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients in Group A go straight to surgery. By looking for markers of low oxygen levels on&#xD;
      the tumour that has been removed, we will be able to find out which of the study tests&#xD;
      performed before the tumour was removed is the best. By repeating the scans we will be able&#xD;
      to see how reliable they are and how much they change on a day to day basis. We think that&#xD;
      tumours that still have low levels of oxygen after 8 to 10 doses of radiotherapy are the&#xD;
      least likely to respond to treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group B will have scans before radiotherapy treatment and after 8 to 10 doses of radiotherapy&#xD;
      to see if we can identify the patients that have persistent low levels of oxygen.&#xD;
