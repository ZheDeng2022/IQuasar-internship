    <description>The duration of response is measured from the time measurement criteria are met for Complete Response or Partial Response (whichever is first recorded) until the first date that recurrent disease or progressive disease is objectively documented (taking as reference for progressive disease the smallest measurements recorded since the study treatment started). Kaplan-Meier methodology will be used to estimate event-free curves and corresponding quantiles (including the median).</description>
