      Maraviroc is an antiretroviral medication that may help in improving mental function in HIV&#xD;
      infected patients with mental problems by decreasing inflammatory tendencies. We will test&#xD;
      this in a clinical trial of 42 HIV infected individuals with some mild to moderate mental&#xD;
      problems who are already on HIV medications and doing well. We will add Maraviroc or a sugar&#xD;
      pill to their HIV medications and see if mental function improves over 48 weeks. This study&#xD;
      will be conducted at 2 sites in Hawaii and Puerto Rico.&#xD;

      We hypothesize that maraviroc (MVC) will lead to improved cognition as assessed by&#xD;
      improvement in neuropsychological (NP) performance. We hypothesize that MVC therapy leads to&#xD;
      (1) decrease in HIV infection of monocytes (MO), particularly of CD16-expressing MO and (2)&#xD;
      phenotypic and functional secretory changes suggestive of decrease in MO immune activation,&#xD;
      and that these changes will lead to less HIV infected activated MO trafficking to the CNS,&#xD;
      less CNS inflammation and neuronal damage, and ultimately improved cognition. We will test&#xD;
      this in a 48 week trial in 42 HIV infected individuals on suppressive antiretroviral therapy&#xD;
      (ART) with mild to moderate cognitive dysfunction. These individuals will be randomized to&#xD;
      intensify their ART in double-blind fashion to MVC vs placebo. The primary endpoint will be&#xD;
      change in NPZglobal. Magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS)/magnetic resonance spectroscopic&#xD;
      imaging (MRSI) will be conducted to assess potential alterations in inflammatory and neuronal&#xD;
      brain chemicals.&#xD;
