      The genomic heterogeneity of cancers implies that to effectively use targeted therapies the&#xD;
      investigators will need to assess each individual cancer and match it to a biologically&#xD;
      relevant targeted therapy. The investigators will use full genome sequencing to try to&#xD;
      identify cancer &quot;drivers&quot; and corresponding drugs that may inhibit these pathways.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Carcinogenesis is an immensely complex process such that even within a histologic cancer&#xD;
      subtype - for example adenocarcinoma of the lung or breast - there is significant variability&#xD;
      in cancer behaviour and response to therapy. Analyses of individual patients demonstrate&#xD;
      unique molecular signatures for every cancer examined. Frequently, multiple different&#xD;
      pathways are involved in disease growth and progression and the dominant process varies from&#xD;
      person to person and perhaps even within different sites of disease within one person. As&#xD;
      well these variations evolve in response to treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recognizing genetic aberrations that promote disease facilitates targeted treatment; this has&#xD;
      been demonstrated in several small subgroups of cancers in which specific genetic mutations&#xD;
      or translocations have been successfully treated with targeted chemotherapy agents. With many&#xD;
      recognized mutations and aberrations, personalized evaluation of the genetic signature&#xD;
      encoded in DNA and RNA may provide important diagnostic information and potentially enable&#xD;
      directed therapy to the appropriate oncologic pathway thereby providing information to help&#xD;
      guide chemotherapy choices&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our initial pilot project demonstrated the feasibility of this approach at our institution&#xD;
      (with 100 patients). We now know it is possible to identify and consent patients, sequence&#xD;
      the genome and transcriptome, analyze and report abnormalities, and identify potential&#xD;
      actionable targets in a clinically relevant time frame.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Personalized OncoGenomics (POG) program has been operational across the province of BC&#xD;
      since 2012. The initial two-year phase established the infrastructure and workflow by which&#xD;
      patients with metastatic or incurable cancers could be identified, consented, and biopsied&#xD;
      for genomic sequencing in a clinically accredited lab (Laskin et al., 2015). The next phase&#xD;
      of the POG program (2014 - 2017) included a strong educational and engagement process such&#xD;
      that 83 (80%) of the medical oncologists at BC Cancer were trained to consent and enroll&#xD;
      patients onto POG. This means that the oncology community in BC has a broad education in&#xD;
      cancer genomics and how these data may be applied to individual patients. Since 2017, the&#xD;
      program has been integrated into the Vancouver Cancer Centre's phase 1 clinical trials unit&#xD;
      and the focus has shifted to use the study patients and data to address more focused clinical&#xD;
      therapeutic trials such as the CCTG CAPTUR study (Skamene et al., 2018). POG-like WGTA has&#xD;
      been the driving force behind the creation of the Terry Fox Marathon of Hope Cancer Centre&#xD;
      Network (MOHCCN) which is a national program for cancer genomic data sharing across Canada.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The overarching theme of this POG Program is to create a comprehensive cataloguing of somatic&#xD;
      cancer mutations and cellular pathway abnormalities that could generate profound insights&#xD;
      into genetic patterns that underlie particular cancer phenotypes, and provide valuable&#xD;
      prognostic and predictive information.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible subjects will have several samples analyzed: a fresh tumour biopsy (typically 5&#xD;
      cores are required), a blood sample for normal comparison and archival tumours when&#xD;
      available. Also, technology has improved such that we may consider using paraffin embedded&#xD;
      materials. Comprehensive DNA and RNA sequencing is performed followed by an in-depth&#xD;
      bioinformatic analysis to identify somatic mutations, gene expression changes or other&#xD;
      abnormalities that might be cancer &quot;drivers&quot; or provide actionable (diagnostic) or druggable&#xD;
      targets. The POG team meets every week to discuss the detailed genomic reports for patients,&#xD;
      consider additional validation tests when necessary, and debate research questions. The&#xD;
      clinicians (typically 5 - 10) come to a consensus on what systemic therapies might be&#xD;
      appropriate based on these results. Whenever possible subjects are matched to clinical&#xD;
      trials.&#xD;

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Patients must agree to allow their archival specimens to be used and possibly&#xD;
             completely depleted for these analyses.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Willing and able to have a study-specific biopsy or resection of the tumour or&#xD;
             metastatic site OR if there is adequate archival material available, either fresh&#xD;
             frozen or FFPE (if specimen is thought to be adequate) that is taken after the most&#xD;
             recent chemo or radiation. Ideally this sample should have been collected within 16&#xD;
             weeks of the date of consent. If archival tissue is not adequate and if a biopsy is&#xD;
             not feasible or deemed medically safe by the investigators the patient would become&#xD;
             ineligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Patients must understand and agree to provide a blood test (or other sample of normal&#xD;
             DNA) for germline genomic analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. ECOG PS 0 or 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Age &gt;/= 18 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Estimated life expectancy &gt;/= 6 months and high likelihood of being clinically fit for&#xD;
             a therapeutic clinical trial in 3-6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Measurable disease with RECIST v1.1 (or updated version).&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Adequate organ function.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Patients must clearly understand that this data may be used to help guide treatment&#xD;
             recommendations, including the avoidance of some therapeutic agents or the suggestion&#xD;
             to use standard cytotoxic chemotherapy agents.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Willingness to have their de-identified genomic and clinical data shared with national&#xD;
             and international research collaborators and data sharing platforms (as detailed in&#xD;
             the consent form).&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Willingness to be contacted for future studies based on the data that is generated by&#xD;
             participation in POG; included in this is the anticipation that patient would be fit&#xD;
             or a candidate for clinical trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Unable or unwilling to consent to the above tissue and blood requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Significant medical condition that in the opinion of the treating or consenting&#xD;
             oncologist and/or the POG central office review team renders the subject not suitable&#xD;
             for participation. This includes the likelihood that a subject would be suitable for a&#xD;
             clinical trial within 12 weeks after POG biopsy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Unwilling or unable to provide treatment and outcome follow up information to the BC&#xD;
             Cancer or affiliated investigators.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Unwilling to receive medically actionable findings (germline and/or somatic).&#xD;
