  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this longitudinal study with a follow up time of at least 6 months, up to 300 tuberculosis&#xD;
      (TB) patients or TB suspects will be screened for TB using the Xpert MTB/RIF assay along with&#xD;
      standard smear microscopy after Ziehl-Neelsen staining at the TB health clinic located at&#xD;
      Mavalane health center. Confirmed TB cases will be followed up during TB therapy until month&#xD;
      six after treatment initiation in order to obtain clinical and microbiological data on&#xD;
      treatment including treatment response. Apart from relevant research questions in the field&#xD;
      of TB diagnostics and treatment, the main objective of this study will be the development of&#xD;
      a clinical TB research site, including capacity development in clinical and laboratory based&#xD;
      TB research methods, in Mavalane, Maputo.&#xD;

      Main study objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To assess the feasibility to perform a TB clinical trial in Maputo, Mozambique, by screening,&#xD;
      examining,enrollment, follow-up and data collection of TB patients sent for TB treatment as&#xD;
      well as TB suspects who are sent for smear microscopy to the TB clinic at the Mavalane health&#xD;
      center.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening of study patients:&#xD;
&#xD;
      After consenting, each study participant (with confirmed or suspected TB) will be screened&#xD;
      for TB with smear microscopy after Ziehl-Neelsen staining and Xpert MTB/RIF assay. In&#xD;
      patients with signs of extrapulmonary TB manifestation, specimen collection other than sputum&#xD;
      are to be decided by the treating physician in the patient' s best interest, to establish TB&#xD;
      diagnosis by using smear microscopy and/or Xpert MTB/RIF assay. Patients without a positive&#xD;
      Xpert MTB/RIF-assay result will not continue in the study but will be referred to the&#xD;
      National TB Program for further evaluation and treatment. In patients with a positive Xpert&#xD;
      MTB/RIF result in any specimen anti TB treatment will be commenced according to the National&#xD;
      Guidelines. All TB positive study participants will be followed up until 6 months after TB&#xD;
      treatment initiation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow up visits will occur at week 1, 2, 4, 8, 12, 17 and 26 after commencement of TB&#xD;
      therapy. An optional visit will be performed in selected patients at week 52 in order to&#xD;
      confirm cure of TB disease. At each study visit, a clinical investigation will be performed&#xD;
      and a medical questionnaire will be completed for each participant. Further, sputum and urine&#xD;
      samples will be collected for the evaluation of the new TB diagnostics. A chest x-ray will be&#xD;
      performed and blood for HIV testing, CD4 count, biochemistry and full blood picture will be&#xD;
      collected at baseline only or when medically indicated during the course of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data recording and analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will follow ethical principles as outlined in the declaration of Helsinki and its&#xD;
      revisions (last in 2008) and will be performed in compliance with the guidelines of Good&#xD;
      Clinical, Laboratory (GCLP) and Clinical Data Management Practice (GCDMP). All essential&#xD;
      documents will be archived for 3 years. All patient information will be treated in a strictly&#xD;
      confidential manner and will be linked to a unique ID number and not to personal identifiers.&#xD;
      Data will be collected on paper CRFs, which will be entered into a secured clinical data&#xD;
      management system, for which daily backups will be done. Double data entry will minimize data&#xD;
      entry errors, and full data validation and cleaning process will be employed.&#xD;
