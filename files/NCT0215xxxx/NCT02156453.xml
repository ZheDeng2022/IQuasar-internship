    <textblock>
      Total knee replacement is one of the most successful surgical procedures in Orthopaedics.&#xD;
      However, 10-20% of the patients are still dissatisfied with the results of the surgery. In&#xD;
      general, the evaluation of postoperative functional outcomes are usually measured by&#xD;
      self-report questionnaires, such as the Western Ontario and Mcmaster Universities&#xD;
      osteoarthritic Index (WOMAC) and the Short Form-36 health survey (SF-36). Another method to&#xD;
      evaluate functional outcome of the patients is to use the performance-based tests such as the&#xD;
      two-minute walk test, but there is still little information regarding its use for evaluating&#xD;
      functional recovery in patients receiving total knee arthroplasty.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objectives this study are: 1) to assess the relationship between self-report&#xD;
      questionnaires and performance-based tests among patients scheduling for TKA; and 2) to&#xD;
      identify clinical variables that are associated with pre- and postoperative functional&#xD;
      performance of the patients.&#xD;

      Osteoarthritis (OA) of the knee is one of the most prevalent age-related musculoskeletal&#xD;
      conditions, resulting in significant impairment in patients' abilities to perform activities&#xD;
      and adversely impacting their quality of life. The level of impairment in patients with knee&#xD;
      OA can be measured using validated self-report questionnaires, such as the disease-specific&#xD;
      Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) and the generic&#xD;
      Medical Outcomes Study Short Form-36 (SF-36). Self-report questionnaires have been&#xD;
      recommended by some investigators for their high internal consistency and ease of&#xD;
      administration. Another method to evaluate physical function in patients with knee OA is to&#xD;
      use performance-based tests. These tests are tools that assess patients' ability to execute a&#xD;
      task in a standardized environment, and include the 2-minute walk test (2MWT) and the timed&#xD;
      get-up-and-go test (TUG).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Among all the self-reported questionnaires for knee OA, the WOMAC is one of the most commonly&#xD;
      used for baseline assessment and for measurement of treatment outcome, and has been validated&#xD;
      for patients undergoing total knee arthroplasty (TKA). Although the WOMAC provides&#xD;
      information on how individuals perceive their physical function in their own environment, it&#xD;
      does not describe their ability to perform a specific task or action. In addition, some&#xD;
      investigators showed that scores from self-report questionnaires before and after&#xD;
      arthroplasty can overestimate patients' actual functional capacity. For example, Parent et al&#xD;
      demonstrated that total knee arthroplasty patients had a dramatic improvement at 2 months as&#xD;
      assessed by the WOMAC function subscale, however there were no significant changes when&#xD;
      measured with performance-based tests assessing gait speed and stair ascent duration.&#xD;
      Therefore, clinicians should be cautious when interpreting findings from studies that provide&#xD;
      only self-report questionnaire scores. Given that self-report questionnaires may&#xD;
      over-estimate functional status after joint replacement, some authors advocate&#xD;
      performance-based tests as measures of outcome, and recommend their use during the&#xD;
      preoperative period as baseline measurements followed by subsequent comparison with&#xD;
      postoperative measurements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objectives of this study are: 1) to assess the relationship between self-reported&#xD;
      questionnaires (WOMAC and SF-36) and performance-based tests (2MWT, TUG) among patients&#xD;
      scheduling for TKA; and 2) to identify clinical variables that are associated with pre- and&#xD;
      post-operative performance of the 2MWT and TUG. Our hypothesis is that correlations between&#xD;
      self-report questionnaires and performance-based tests would be low to moderate, and thus&#xD;
      these two types of measurements evaluate distinct domains of functional status in patients&#xD;
      undergoing TKA.&#xD;
