  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Canadian Respiratory Research Network (CRRN) has recently been established to study the&#xD;
      origins and evolution of airways disease in the population. The CRRN is funded by the&#xD;
      Institute of Cardio-respiratory Health (ICRH), an institute of the CIHR. The Physiology&#xD;
      platform will support the other CRRN platforms (biology, imaging, population health,&#xD;
      knowledge transfer) by providing a comprehensive characterization of the nature and extent of&#xD;
      physiological impairment of respiratory function in smokers at risk for airways disease and&#xD;
      in those with early or mild airway obstruction. The planned studies of the physiology group&#xD;
      (core sites located at Queen's University, University of British Columbia and McGill&#xD;
      University) will initially focus on smoking-related lung injury in those at risk for COPD and&#xD;
      in those meeting spirometric criteria for mild airway obstruction, with or without&#xD;
      respiratory symptoms. The primary aim of this initial study is to identify and validate&#xD;
      sensitive test(s) of peripheral airway dysfunction that may qualify as physiological&#xD;
      biomarkers for use in future CRRN studies.&#xD;

    <description>There is no single measurement of small airway function since this study is evaluating which measurements, among a list of conventional and experimental physiological parameters, best characterize the nature and extent of impairment of respiratory function in the smoking study groups and which of these parameters best predict clinical outcome (i.e., dyspnea, exercise capacity, ventilatory capacity, health status). Assessments will include: spirometry, closing volume, impulse oscillometry, frequency dependence of dynamic lung compliance, plethysmographic lung volumes and metronome-paced dynamic hyperinflation.</description>

        Subjects will include 30 participants from each of the following four subgroups: GOLD grade&#xD;
        1A COPD, GOLD grade 1B COPD, symptomatic smokers who do not meet spirometric criteria for&#xD;
        COPD, and age- and sex-matched healthy non-smoking controls. Subjects will be recruited&#xD;
        from the Canadian Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (CanCOLD) study cohort and, once that&#xD;
        source has been exhausted, from each site's database of previous or potential research&#xD;
        study participants. The CanCOLD Study cohort was recruited from the COLD Study sample,&#xD;
        which was a random sample of adults ≥40 years of age who had pre- and post-bronchodilator&#xD;
        spirometry performed in order to estimate the prevalence of COPD in Canada.&#xD;

        INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Stable patients with GOLD grade 1 mild COPD will be included in the study if they have: a&#xD;
        post-bronchodilator FEV1≥80 %predicted and an FEV1/FVC ratio &lt;0.7 and &lt;LLN; ≥40 years of&#xD;
        age; and a cigarette smoking history ≥10 pack-years or ≥10 years of exposure to other&#xD;
        inhaled substances (i.e., second hand smoke and/or biomass). Symptomatic (category B)&#xD;
        subjects will have a Baseline Dyspnea Index (BDI) total score ≤9, a modified Medical&#xD;
        Research Council (MRC) dyspnea score ≥2, or a COPD Assessment Test (CAT) score ≥10.&#xD;
        Asymptomatic (category A) subjects will have a BDI&gt;9, modified MRC&lt;2 or CAT&lt;10, no history&#xD;
        of seeking medical care for respiratory symptoms, and no history of using respiratory&#xD;
        medications. Symptomatic current or ex-smokers (&gt;10 pack-year history) who do not meet&#xD;
        criteria for COPD (e.g., post-bronchodilator FEV1&lt;80%predicted and FEV1/FVC&lt;0.7, with both&#xD;
        measurements also &lt;LLN) and who are on no respiratory medication will be included.&#xD;
        Symptomatic will be defined as: BDI≤9, modified MRC≥2 or CAT&gt;10. Healthy, age- and&#xD;
        sex-matched, non-smoking (&lt;2 pack-year history) participants with normal spirometry will be&#xD;
        used for comparison purposes.&#xD;

             exercise limitation (i.e., unstable heart disease, a pulmonary disease other than&#xD;
             COPD, uncontrolled diabetes, neuromuscular or orthopedic impairment);&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  history/clinical evidence of asthma;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  contraindications to exercise testing;&#xD;
