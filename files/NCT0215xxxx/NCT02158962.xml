      The purpose of this study is to combine a culturally tailored and integrated Risk Reduction&#xD;
      Intervention in the US Virgin Islands (USVI) in a clinical trial randomly assigning abused&#xD;
      women to a 1) Healthy Relationships experimental group of three sessions of risk reduction&#xD;
      interventions or 2) a Healthy Living comparison control group of three session of health&#xD;
      promotion activities to determine if the combined, intervention is safe and effective in a&#xD;
      test the following hypotheses:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Women in the integrated risk reduction intervention will score significantly lower on&#xD;
           outcome measures of intimate partner abuse (IPA) and STD/HIV risk behaviors end of&#xD;
           Session III and at 3 and 6 months than women in the control group&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Women in the integrated risk reduction Intervention will score significantly higher on&#xD;
           IPA safety behaviors and STI/HIV prevention behaviors at end of Session III and at 3 and&#xD;
           6 months than women in the control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several exploratory and major controlled studies on the mainland US have shown intimate&#xD;
      partner violence (IPV) and intimate partner abuse (IPA) to be risk factors for a variety of&#xD;
      physical, reproductive and mental health problems, including sexually transmitted infections&#xD;
      and HIV/AIDS, many of which are areas of known health disparity for African American and&#xD;
      Latina women. A recently completed study of African Caribbean and African American women in&#xD;
      the US Virgin Islands revealed that nearly one third of women reported lifetime partner abuse&#xD;
      and increased risk for sexually transmitted infections including HIV/AIDS. Abused women in&#xD;
      the USVI had significantly more risk factors for HIV/AIDS than did women who were not abused.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed intervention combines an empowerment model designed to help abused women make&#xD;
      choices that protect the physical and emotional health of the woman and her family with a&#xD;
      sexual safety model designed to help her make choices to reduce her risk of acquiring an STI&#xD;
      or contracting HIV/AIDS. The integrated model adapts two interventions that have been tested&#xD;
      with African American women on the US mainland and found to be effective as separate&#xD;
      interventions for IPV and IPA and reducing the risk of STI/HIV. The adapted interventions&#xD;
      will be used with abused African Caribbean women based on an a priori assessment of the&#xD;
      cultural attitudes, beliefs and resources available to women living in an island environment&#xD;
      with limited resources.&#xD;

      I. Background and Significance: Several exploratory and major controlled studies conducted on&#xD;
      the mainland US have shown intimate partner violence (IPV) or intimate partner abuse (IPA) to&#xD;
      be risk factors for a variety of physical, reproductive and mental health problems, including&#xD;
      HIV/AIDS, many of which are areas of known health disparity for African American and Latina&#xD;
      women.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The current investigators recently completed the first in-depth prevalence study of violence&#xD;
      and abuse of women in the US Virgin islands (USVI) and associated health consequences. This&#xD;
      seminal study showed 1) Lifetime prevalence of IPV of 32.8% in the USVI and past two year&#xD;
      prevalence of 37.2%%.in a sample of 1059 women aged 18-55 who self-identified as African&#xD;
      Caribbean or from African descent and who had an intimate partner during the past two years&#xD;
      2) Past two year physical and/or sexual abuse ranged from 4 % on the island of St Croix to 9%&#xD;
      on St Thomas 3) Abused women had significantly more risk factors for Sexually Transmitted&#xD;
      Infections (STIs) and HIV/AIDS than did women not abused, and 4) Risk factors for STIs and&#xD;
      HIV/AIDS included being forced into vaginal or anal sex, women having concurrent partners or&#xD;
      their partners having multiple partners, having a STI, lack of consistent condom use, and&#xD;
      exchange sex (trading sex for material goods) This study also found women amenable to being&#xD;
      asked about IPV in health care settings where a brief intervention could be feasibly&#xD;
      implemented. Preliminary qualitative work illuminated women's perceptions of community and&#xD;
      cultural perspectives on IPV in the USVI. The proposed randomized clinical trial (RCT) builds&#xD;
      on findings from the prior study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Research Strategy: A RCT will provide a preliminary test of an intervention designed to&#xD;
      reduce IPV and IPA and the concurrent risk of STIs and HIV in abused USVI women by empowering&#xD;
      their use of safety behaviors and increasing their use of resources... IPV and IPA have been&#xD;
      linked to high-risk sexual behaviors, the inability to negotiate safer sex behaviors, and&#xD;
      negative sexual health outcomes. The research plan is to deliver a structured intervention to&#xD;
      reduce the devastating impact of IPV and IPA for abused women in the USVI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Time I: Women will respond to baseline data measures using computer assisted self-reports.&#xD;
      Data collected include socio-demographic and cultural characteristics of women and their&#xD;
      partners, past and recent intimate partner physical, sexual and emotional abuse (SVAWS),&#xD;
      Danger Assessment (DA), baseline HIV/STD status and risks for infection, including condom&#xD;
      use. To minimize attrition contact information for each participant and for three contact&#xD;
      persons (family, friends, and neighbors) will also be collected. Abused women will be&#xD;
      randomized by the computer to either the Healthy Relationships Risk Reduction experimental&#xD;
      intervention group or the Healthy Lifestyles comparison control group A. Session 1- Risk&#xD;
      Reduction Intervention Group. Women in the Experimental Intervention will complete this&#xD;
      session following initial assessment and group assignment. The ESP-DOVE IPV Empowerment&#xD;
      Intervention is an individualized (60 minute) protocol following the initial enrollment&#xD;
      session. Abused women will view a video developed in the US Virgin Islands, using local&#xD;
      actors, depicting various experiences of abused Virgin Island. The abused women will&#xD;
      participate in a one on one structured, brochure-based intervention with a trained&#xD;
      interventionist that addresses information about the cycle of violence, risk factors that may&#xD;
      increase a woman's danger of homicide (the Danger Assessment), choices or options (leaving,&#xD;
      using local shelter resources, accessing resources in the criminal justice system), safety&#xD;
      planning, and specific local and national phone numbers for IPV resources. The intervention&#xD;
      provides the woman with information, emphasizing that she has options or The structured ESP-&#xD;
      DOVE intervention is interactive and encourages the woman to describe her experiences and&#xD;
      choose her options as they proceed. The intervention has been modified to be culturally&#xD;
      appropriate for abused women of African Caribbean or African American background living in&#xD;
      the US Virgin Islands. Since the context of IPV varies considerably, this approach allows&#xD;
      individualization, client input and choice, all thought to enhance intervention success with&#xD;
      battered women and other &quot;hard to reach&quot; populations At the same time, the brochure gives the&#xD;
      nurse and other interventionists a script to increase uniformity of the intervention across&#xD;
      women and interventionists. Four major intervention components: a) IPV information, b) Danger&#xD;
      Assessment, c) Safety Planning, and d) Resources are explored. At the end of Session I, the&#xD;
      woman in the risk reduction intervention group will provide contact information for Session 2&#xD;
      which will be scheduled one week later.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Time 2: Session 2- Women will assess their needs associated with IPV, safety behaviors and&#xD;
      feelings about how their situation is evolving. The need for resources and services will be&#xD;
      explored. The session will also focus on helping the women learn how to reduce their risk for&#xD;
      HIV/STD infections. This one-on-one behavioral intervention has been found to reduce HIV/STD&#xD;
      risk behaviors and STD morbidity among inner-city African American women in primary care&#xD;
      settings in a NINR funded randomized controlled trial. The intervention has been modified and&#xD;
      culturally tailored for abused women in the US Virgin Islands and involves a skill-building&#xD;
      one-on-one session that the facilitator tailors to the specific needs of each participant&#xD;
      after conducting an HIV/STD risk assessment interview. It involves STD prevention behavioral&#xD;
      skills, video clips, condom demonstration, practice with an anatomical model, and&#xD;
      role-playing. Curriculum activities are also designed to help women recognize that faulty&#xD;
      reasoning and decision-making can increase their risk of HIV infection. The activities help&#xD;
      the women understand the adverse consequences of participating in unsafe sexual activity and&#xD;
      the positive consequences of safer sexual practices. Contact information for Session 3 will&#xD;
      be validated and a follow up group session scheduled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Time 3: Session 3: The third session will consist of small groups (8-10) of women in a&#xD;
      supportive/educational session led by an interventionist and investigator. Sessions held in&#xD;
      each district in the USVI and will be scheduled two weeks following Session 2. Women in the&#xD;
      experimental intervention group will have another opportunity to integrate issues related to&#xD;
      their IPV experiences. . They will interact with other abused women in a setting conducive to&#xD;
      sharing attitudes and beliefs about IPV prevention, cultural beliefs about IPV, the need for&#xD;
      support, assertiveness training, stress and affect management, safety enhancement strategies&#xD;
      and effective behaviors to reduce the risk of HIV and sexually transmitted disease and&#xD;
      personal vulnerability. Session three will be offered twice each week in each district until&#xD;
      all participants have had an opportunity to complete the intervention. At the end of session&#xD;
      3, the women will be scheduled for a three month follow-up to assess outcomes. Contact&#xD;
      information will be reconfirmed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      B. Healthy Living Comparison Control Group Session 1: Women in the Healthy Living comparison&#xD;
      control group will complete the baseline assessment using the computer assisted tablets for&#xD;
      self-report. Women who report a history of intimate partner abuse will be will be yoked on&#xD;
      age (&gt;25 or &lt;below 25) and ethnicity (Hispanic or Non-Hispanic and education (HS grad vs &lt;&#xD;
      high school graduation). During Session one, if randomly assigned to the Healthy Living&#xD;
      Comparison Control intervention group, they will be focus on Breast Health Education and how&#xD;
      to develop a breast health care plan aimed at reducing the risk of breast cancer in women of&#xD;
      African heritage. Obesity as a risk factor for breast cancer will be introduced. Booklets on&#xD;
      breast health and developing a breast health plan will be provided as well as general&#xD;
      resource information on women and child health services. Contact information for the one week&#xD;
      follow up will be obtained and the woman given an appointment for Session II.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Session 2: At time two women in the comparison control health promotion group will be&#xD;
      involved in a session on Healthy Lifestyles for African Caribbean Women: Reducing Obesity&#xD;
      Risks. The one on one interactive session will discuss the association between breast cancer&#xD;
      and obesity as well as other major health problems associated with obesity. They learn how to&#xD;
      assess their Body Mass Index and measure waist conference to determine whether or not they&#xD;
      are at risk for obesity related health problems. The session will last approximately one&#xD;
      hour. They will also be briefly reassessed for abuse to determine if abuse is escalating and&#xD;
      the need for a referral. Participant contact information will be confirmed and Session 3&#xD;
      scheduled two weeks later.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Session 3: At time three participants in the comparison control health promotion group&#xD;
      control will engage in a follow up group session of 6-8 women that will include sharing&#xD;
      progress made on developing breast health plans as well as planned choices to reduce obesity&#xD;
      and promote healthy lifestyles including diet and exercise. The group discussion will be&#xD;
      facilitated by the original facilitator as well as one of the study investigators. Contact&#xD;
      information for the final follow up will be will be validated. Participants will complete a&#xD;
      post interview on the computer and a 3 month follow-up outcome assessment will be scheduled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      C. Outcome Measures Time 4: Intervention outcomes will be measured at three months to assess&#xD;
      effectiveness and safety of the Integrated Risk Reduction Intervention for Women Experiencing&#xD;
      IPA. Participants will include women who completed all three sessions of the Risk Reduction&#xD;
      intervention or three sessions of the Health Education Comparison Control group. The outcome&#xD;
      measures will be completed on computer tablets and will include the same measures that were&#xD;
      used at the initial assessment in addition to an assessment of changes in safety and&#xD;
      prevention behaviors. Participants will be scheduled for a six month follow-up for final&#xD;
      outcome measures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Time 5: Final post intervention outcome measures will be obtained six months after the&#xD;
      participant completes the 3 month outcome measures. The women will again be contacted at&#xD;
      least two weeks prior to the scheduled outcomes measures by Caribbean Exploratory NIMHD&#xD;
      Research Center Staff to re-confirm the scheduled follow-up and will repeat the same process&#xD;
      on computer tablets including outcome measures used at the three month assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      D. Data management&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Preliminary Analyses: Microsoft Access and Excel will be used for record keeping,&#xD;
           tracking, and initial data processing. The latest versions of SAS and SPSS computer&#xD;
           programs will be used for data management and analysis. Access to the computers and data&#xD;
           CDs will be limited both physically and electronically. Computers and data will be&#xD;
           stored in an office that is locked when not in use. Access to databases will be&#xD;
           restricted with read and write protection. Data analysis will begin with preparatory&#xD;
           activities such as the treatment of missing data, identification of outliers and other&#xD;
           such data cleaning tasks. A detailed descriptive analysis of all quantitative data will&#xD;
           be performed, involving the summarization of data and the use of inferential and&#xD;
           graphical exploratory data analytic techniques.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Analysis: To conduct a preliminary test of the integrated intervention as described in&#xD;
           the brief description, analysis of covariance, frequency and logistic regression will be&#xD;
           used to explore potential differences in predictor variables between the two groups.&#xD;
