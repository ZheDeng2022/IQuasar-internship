      The primary purpose of this study is the evaluate an Artificial Pancreas during 2 months in&#xD;
      home setting in Type 1 Diabetic patients&#xD;

    <textblock>
      During this study, we propose to assess an Artificial Pancreas in a group of Type 1 diabetic&#xD;
      patients who will participate in two study periods of two-month duration with an insulin pump&#xD;
      and a Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) device. During one of these periods, called HYBRID&#xD;
      Period, the patient will use the AP model when at home, from dinner to wake-up time whereas&#xD;
      the patient will self manage glucose control with insulin pump and CGM for the rest of the&#xD;
      day. During the control period called OPEN Period, patient self management of diabetes by&#xD;
      insulin pump and CGM will be done at all times. Overall, an increase of time spent in range&#xD;
      when using artificial pancreas in the hybrid period should be observed with a reduction of&#xD;
      both hypo and hyperglycemia episodes.&#xD;
