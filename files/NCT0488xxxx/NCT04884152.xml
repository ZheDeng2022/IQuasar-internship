  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to compare the effects of Home Exercise Therapy (HET) and&#xD;
      Telerehabilitation in patients with myofascial temporomandibular disorders (TMD)with bruxism.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Home Exercise will be Group 1 and Telerehabilitation group will be Group 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 1 HET, will include an educational training program about parafunctional activities of&#xD;
      TMD disorders and bruxism and active exercises for 4 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As part of the Home exercise program, a written document will be prepared, including&#xD;
      relaxation, breathing training, posture, stretching, and strengthening exercises to be given&#xD;
      to the patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 2, in addition to the training and written document, the second group will receive the&#xD;
      same exercises using telerehabilitation once a week by video call, and reminder messages will&#xD;
      be sent to the patients 3 times a week.&#xD;

    <time_frame>Baseline, 4 weeks, 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Visual Analog Scale will be used where patients will be asked to rate their pain on a scale from 0 to 10 with 0 indicating no pain and 10 the maximum worst pain, at the baseline and the end of 4 weeks intervention and at the end 8 weeks from baseline.</description>

    <measure>Change from Baseline in Neck disability at 4 weeks and 8 weeks</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 4 weeks, 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Neck Disability Index, consisting of a total of ten titles, was developed by Vernon and Mior in 1991. It includes topics such as pain intensity in the neck, personal care, lifting, reading, headaches, concentration, driving, sleep, and leisure activities. The maximum score is 50, while the minimum is 0 points.&#xD;
Classification according to total score is as follows: 0-4 (no restrictions); 5-14 (mild restriction); 15-24 (moderate restriction); 25-34 (severe limitation); 34 and above (completely limited).</description>

    <measure>Change from Baseline in Headache at 4 weeks and 8 weeks</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 4 weeks, 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Headache Impact Test-6 test consists of 6 questions about the severity of headache, the effect of pain on daily life activities, how often it causes fatigue and low motivation, and concentration impairment. Scoring is done between 36-78.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from Baseline in Sleep Quality at 4 weeks and 8 weeks</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 4 weeks, 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Pittsburg Sleep Quality Index test is used to evaluate sleep effects in the last few months. This questionnaire contains 24 questions, 19 of which are personal, and 5 of which are to be answered by a partner about sleep during both day and night. Five questions answered by the partner are not included in the scoring. Self-assessment questions contain different items related to sleep quality, which provide information about sleep duration, latency, and the frequency and severity of specific sleep problems. The total score is between 0-21. A score of 5 and below indicates good sleep quality, and a score above 5 indicates poor sleep quality.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from Baseline in Oral Behavior at 4 weeks and 8 weeks</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 4 weeks, 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Evaluation of oral habits with the Oral Habits Questionnaire consisting of 21 items, each item was evaluated according to the frequency of complaints as &quot;4 = always; 3 = most of the time; 2 = sometimes; 1 = several times or 0 = none&quot;. The questions cover the times of sleep and wakefulness. The overall score ranges from 0 to 84.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from Baseline in Quality of life at 4 weeks and 8 weeks</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 4 weeks, 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The individual's personal perception of how oral health affects their quality of life and general health is measured. Oral Health Impact Profile-14 is a scale system that evaluates this perception with questions for functional limitation, physical pain, psychological discomfort, physical, psychological and social inadequacy, and disability measures. It is concluded that as the total score increases, the severity of the problem increases, and the quality of life decreases.</description>

The questionnaire consists of 9 items in total, and participants are asked to give a score from 1 to 7 for each question. The fatigue level of the patient is determined according to the score obtained by the sum of the points. The higher the level of fatigue, the higher the total score.</description>
