  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Given the novelty of this risk assessment tool, this study will be interested in evaluating&#xD;
      its effectiveness through a retrospective approach. The IDRA risk will be analyzed at the&#xD;
      time of loading the implant (s) in patients who have already placed an implant (s) during the&#xD;
      last five years at the Department of Periodontology and Oral Surgery using the information&#xD;
      collected from the periodontal file previously completed. Therefore, patients whose IDRA has&#xD;
      been calculated will be called for a clinical and radiological examination to verify the&#xD;
      development or not of peri-implantitis or the loss of the implant. In this way, this tool for&#xD;
      predicting peri-implant disease will be evaluated to see if it is really effective.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      First, the files of patients who have placed an implant(s) at the Departments of&#xD;
      Periodontology and Oral Surgery of the Faculty of Dental Medicine of Saint Joseph University,&#xD;
      Beirut-Lebanon over the past five years (2015, 2016, 2017, 2018 and 2019) will be collected.&#xD;
      Subsequently, thanks to the periodontal file and to the X-rays previously taken, the eight&#xD;
      periodontal parameters necessary for the determination of the IDRA will be recorded (history&#xD;
      of periodontitis; percentage of bleeding on probing; the number of teeth / implants with a&#xD;
      pocket depth ≥ 5mm; the ratio between the level of bone loss (evaluated radiographically&#xD;
      using retro-alveolar or panoramic X-rays already present in the patient's radiological record&#xD;
      on the DBSWIN® software) and the patient's age ( at the time of loading the implant); the&#xD;
      susceptibility to periodontitis (diagnosis) as described by the new classification of&#xD;
      periodontal diseases and peri-implant from the World Workshop in 2017; compliance with&#xD;
      maintenance visits; the distance (in mm) between the limit of the prosthesis and the marginal&#xD;
      bone level (seen on the X-ray of the infrastructure or after sealing / screwing the&#xD;
      prosthesis); prosthetic factors (such as the precision of adaptation of the prosthesis to the&#xD;
      implant or the excess cement) and filled in on an Excel sheet. These data will then be&#xD;
      reported online by following this link http://www.ircohe.net/IDRA which will make it possible&#xD;
      to calculate by itself the IDRA of each patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As a result, each patient will have a personalized IDRA chart and they will be either at low,&#xD;
      medium or high risk of developing peri-implantitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The retrospective analysis of the files being completed, the patients will be called to come&#xD;
      to the Department of Periodontology in order to take the necessary measures to verify the&#xD;
      presence or absence of a possible peri-implantitis on the one hand or the loss of the implant&#xD;
      on the other hand.&#xD;

    <description>Using a PCP UNC 15 Hu Friedy® periodontal probe and a gentle horizontal sweeping motion through the peri-implant &quot;tunnel&quot; or sulcus the examiner will assess bleeding on probing, the main factor in determining peri-implant inflammation and subsequently possible peri-implantitis. Then, using the same instrument, the author will examine whether there is an increase in the values of pocket depths compared to the initial values, highlighting an installation of peri-implant disease. Radiographically, evidence of bone loss after healing through taking a digital x-ray that will be viewed on DBSWIN® software will help authors make a diagnosis of peri-implantitis as well. It will be required that the digital film be perfectly parallel to the axis of the implant and the X-ray tube perpendicular to them in order to have an orthogonal radiograph.</description>
