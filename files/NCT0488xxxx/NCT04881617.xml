  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Primary progressive aphasia (PPA) is a progressive neurological disorder that causes a&#xD;
      gradual decline in communication ability as a result of selective neurodegeneration of speech&#xD;
      and language networks in the brain. PPA is a devastating condition affecting adults as young&#xD;
      as their 40's or 50's, depriving them of the ability to communicate and function in society.&#xD;
      There has been significant progress in discovering the neurobiological mechanisms that&#xD;
      underlie PPA and in identifying its clinical phenotypes. With these advances, we are poised&#xD;
      to investigate behavioral treatments that are grounded in modern cognitive and&#xD;
      neuroanatomical concepts. Research documenting the efficacy of speech-language treatment for&#xD;
      PPA is emerging, but limited. Systematic research is needed to establish best clinical&#xD;
      practices in this unique patient population for whom pharmacological treatment remains&#xD;
      elusive. The long-term objectives of this project are to provide evidence-based treatment&#xD;
      methods addressing the speech and language deficits in PPA and to determine the neural&#xD;
      predictors of responsiveness to intervention. The study has three main goals that build on&#xD;
      the findings of our previous work: 1) to examine the utility of treatments designed to&#xD;
      facilitate significant, generalized and lasting improvement of speech-language function in&#xD;
      PPA, 2) to determine whether treatment alters the trajectory of decline in PPA by comparing&#xD;
      performance on primary outcome measures in treated versus untreated participants after a&#xD;
      one-year interval, and 3) to identify imaging predictors (gray matter, white matter, and&#xD;
      functional connectivity measures) of responsiveness to behavioral intervention in individuals&#xD;
      with PPA. In order to accomplish these aims, we will enroll 60 individuals with PPA, who will&#xD;
      undergo a comprehensive multidisciplinary evaluation and neuroimaging. Subsequently,&#xD;
      participants will be enrolled in treatment designed to promote lasting and generalized&#xD;
      improvement of communicative function in core speech-language domains. Participants will be&#xD;
      followed for up to one-year post-treatment in order to determine long-term effects of&#xD;
      rehabilitation, and their performance will be compared with a historical cohort of untreated&#xD;
      PPA patients. This ambitious study and the necessary recruitment will be possible due to an&#xD;
      ongoing collaboration with the UCSF Memory and Aging Center, a leading institution in the&#xD;
      field of PPA research. The study will broaden the evidence base supporting the efficacy of&#xD;
      speech-language intervention in PPA and will provide novel evidence regarding neural&#xD;
      predictors of treatment outcomes, with the potential to inform clinical decision-making and&#xD;
      improve clinical care for individuals with this debilitating disorder.&#xD;

    <description>In person or via teletherapy: Participants work on producing personally relevant scripts of 4-6 sentences in length. Length and complexity of scripts are individually tailored. The participant completes 30 minutes per day of home practice, during which they speak in unison with a video/audio model of a healthy speaker clearly articulating the scripts. Biweekly (one hour each) sessions with a clinician target clear and accurate script production, script memorization, and conversational usage of scripts.</description>
