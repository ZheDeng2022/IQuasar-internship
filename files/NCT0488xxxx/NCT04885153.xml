  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Lipid levels in the blood are proposed to play a role in the progression of diabetic&#xD;
      retinopathy. Lipid levels can be controlled with dyslipidemic drugs, such as fenofibrate.&#xD;
      Fenofibrate is known to prevent diabetic microvascular complications by decreasing&#xD;
      cholesterol and triglyceride levels. This study aims to investigate the effects of oral&#xD;
      fenofibrate on central macular thickness (CMT) and macular volume, as well as on specific&#xD;
      biomarkers of endothelial dysfunction (eNOS), inflammation (VCAM-1), and angiogenesis (VEGF)&#xD;
      in DR individuals with dyslipidemia.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study was a prospective, double-blind, controlled clinical trial. The study was&#xD;
      conducted from 2016 to 2017 at Vitreo-retina Clinic, Department of Ophthalmology, RSCM&#xD;
      Kirana. The subjects were non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy (NPDR) patients with&#xD;
      dyslipidemia or normal lipid profile with treatment. The outcome measures were central&#xD;
      macular thickness (CMT), macular volume, endothelial nitric oxide (eNOS), vascular&#xD;
      endothelial growth factor (VEGF), vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM-1).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The operational definitions used in our study are as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood glucose control: glucose control status based on HbA1c levels within the last 3&#xD;
           month. Normal values &lt; 7%.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Dyslipidemia: patient is diagnosed with dyslipidemia if at least one out of four lipid&#xD;
           profile parameters is above normal limits (LDL cholesterol ≥ 130, mg/dL, total&#xD;
           cholesterol ≥ 200 mg/dL, HDL cholesterol &lt; 40 mg/dL, triglyceride ≥ 150 mg/dL) or normal&#xD;
           with treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Diabetic retinopathy: changes in retinal microvascular based on diabetic retinopathy&#xD;
           classification&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Endothelial dysfunction: plasma endothelial nitric oxide (eNOS)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Inflammation: plasma vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Angiogenesis: plasma vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM-1).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Central macular thickness: thickness of fovea centralis based on OCT&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Macular volume: the volume of the retina in the central 6 mm of the macula&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects with severe renal failure, allergy towards fenofibrate, pregnant women, and subjects&#xD;
      who have undergone laser photocoagulation treatment or intravitreal injection in last 6&#xD;
      months, were excluded. Subjects who did not take medication &gt; 20% of scheduled drug doses&#xD;
      were dropped out.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects were allocated into two groups with block randomizations. Sample size calculation&#xD;
      revealed a minimum sample size of 18 eyes. Subjects in intervention group received 18 mg of&#xD;
      simvastatin and 200 mg of fenofibrate once daily for three months, and subjects in control&#xD;
      group received 18 mg of simvastatin and placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All subjects underwent eye examination, fundus photo, and macular spectral-domain optical&#xD;
      coherence tomography (SD-OCT), as well as monthly blood and urine laboratory tests. All of&#xD;
      the subjects were examined for their uncorrected visual acuity with Snellen chart,&#xD;
      intraocular pressure, slitlamp biomicroscopy, and funduscopy through condensed 78 D lens.&#xD;
      Fundus photo of both eyes of the subjects were taken before intervention, on every monthly&#xD;
      follow-up during intervention, and at the end of study. Fundus photo was done using fundus&#xD;
      digital camera (Kowa Medical Equipments, Japan). All fundus photos were read by two&#xD;
      vitreo-retina consultants as independent readers. Evaluation of DR degree and the presence of&#xD;
      diabetic macula edema (DME) was based on standard of ETDRS severity scale. Inter-reader&#xD;
      reliability was also analyzed using Kappa coefficient calculation, which was considered to be&#xD;
      acceptable if the value was more than 0.6.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Laboratory tests including HbA1c, triglycerides, total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol and LDL&#xD;
      cholesterol, and specific eNOS, VEGF, and serum VCAM-1 biologic markers, were examined at&#xD;
      baseline prior to drug administration, and at the end of the study after 3 months. In&#xD;
      addition, at the beginning of the study, first, second and third month controls were examined&#xD;
      for microalbuminuria, SGOT, SGPT, urine creatinine, blood urea, blood creatinine, and eGFR,&#xD;
      to monitor the safety of drug delivery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data processing was done using IBM Statistic Program for Social Science (SPSS) version 20.&#xD;
      All outcomes were numerical variables, comparison of numerical data between the two groups&#xD;
      was performed with unpaired t-test if normal data distribution was fulfilled, otherwise&#xD;
      non-parametric Mann Whitney test was used if the data was not normally distributed. To assess&#xD;
      the difference between two paired data, Wilcoxon test was used.&#xD;
