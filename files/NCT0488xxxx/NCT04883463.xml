      This is a phase 1 study of safety and feasibility of cervical spinal cord stimulator&#xD;
      implantation in cervical SCI subjects who are ventilator dependent. The Investigators will be&#xD;
      focusing on the safety and feasibility of this approach. Participants may qualify for the&#xD;
      study if they are male or female 18-75 years old, are at least 1 year after original injury,&#xD;
      have injury at C2 to C7 level, and dependent on mechanical ventilation to help them breathe.&#xD;
      Additionally, they need to be able to attend up to twice weekly testing sessions for up to 21&#xD;
      months.&#xD;

      There are five main phases to this study. The first phase is baseline testing, second phase&#xD;
      is temporary implant, third phase is post-temporary implant mapping/treatment, fourth phase&#xD;
      is permanent implant, and fifth phase is post-permanent implant treatment. During each of the&#xD;
      three phases, subjects will have twice weekly laboratory testing sessions and daily home&#xD;
      training sessions. As this is a feasibility study, the phases are designed to select for&#xD;
      subjects that will be most responsive and will benefit from this strategy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 1. Baseline testing/training (up to 6 months, UCLA Semel Institute for Neuroscience and&#xD;
      Human Behavior), the purpose of which is to ensure that each subject begins with the full&#xD;
      benefits achievable by standard rehabilitative respiratory therapy and has stable baseline of&#xD;
      function before they begin epidural stimulation. 15 subjects will undergo this phase. Maximum&#xD;
      inspiratory and expiratory pressure, resting spontaneous respiratory activity, and&#xD;
      respiratory muscle EMG will be measured during this phase. Subjects on ventilator assist mode&#xD;
      (unless or until they can sustain adequate respiration on their own) will be monitored via&#xD;
      pneumotachometer for respiratory frequency changes. Additionally, subjects will undergo motor&#xD;
      and sensory testing. The subjects must show stable respiratory function before implantation,&#xD;
      therefore if a subject is showing small improvements at 3 months the subject will continue&#xD;
      training until they have reached their maximal effect from training (up to 6 months).&#xD;
      Subjects that show stable baseline at 3 months will proceed to Phase 2. If a subject's health&#xD;
      worsens, including non-respiratory functioning, subject will be assessed by appropriate&#xD;
      physician and testing will be held until subject's health has improved and maintains stable&#xD;
      for at least 2 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 2. Temporary Implant (1 day, 24 hours overnight stay, UCLA Medical Center, Santa&#xD;
      Monica). Subjects will undergo temporary stimulator implant surgery. During surgery,&#xD;
      intraoperative mapping with the implant will be performed to demonstrate effective&#xD;
      stimulation areas. Up to 12 subjects with evidence of response to baseline testing will&#xD;
      undergo this phase from the pool of 12 subjects in Phase 1 above. Response to respiratory&#xD;
      training will be based on maximal respiratory effort, respiratory abilities at rest, and&#xD;
      respiratory muscle EMG. Subjects will be monitored overnight following surgery as a&#xD;
      pre-cautionary measure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 3. Post-temporary implant mapping/treatment (up to 10 days, UCLA Semel Institute for&#xD;
      Neuroscience and Human Behavior) Respiratory ability will be assessed. Respiratory&#xD;
      rehabilitation regimen with the stimulator will be used to re-enable respiratory function.&#xD;
      Subjects will be tested daily, up to 10 non-consecutive sessions in the clinic. Each session&#xD;
      will last up to 2 hours. Subject will have the temporary implant for a minimum of 1 week and&#xD;
      maximum of 2 weeks. Maximal respiratory effort and resting respiratory abilities will be&#xD;
      evaluated as well as post-implant PROMs will be assessed. Once optimal parameters have been&#xD;
      identified, electrode configuration(s) that allow subjects to manipulate their respiratory&#xD;
      pattern will be used. Subjects will be allowed to use stimulator at home (daily, with&#xD;
      identified parameters) with respiratory training in addition to twice weekly testing. Home&#xD;
      use will involve turning on the stimulator, breathing with the ventilator. The same 12&#xD;
      subjects from Phase 2 will undergo this phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 4. Permanent implant (1 day, 24 hours overnight stay, UCLA Medical Center, Santa&#xD;
      Monica). Subjects will undergo stimulator implant surgery. During surgery, implantation of&#xD;
      electrodes will be performed. The ideal placement location will be based on previous&#xD;
      temporary trial location. Up to 10 subjects with most connectivity and evidence of response&#xD;
      to baseline testing will undergo this phase from the pool of 12 subjects in Phase 3 above.&#xD;
      Response to respiratory training will be assessed. Subjects will be monitored overnight&#xD;
      following surgery as a pre-cautionary measure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 5. Post-permanent implant mapping/treatment (up to 12 months, UCLA Semel Institute for&#xD;
      Neuroscience and Human Behavior) in which the electrode configuration(s) that activate&#xD;
      respiratory muscles will be used. Respiratory rehabilitation regimen with the stimulator will&#xD;
      be used to re-enable respiratory function. 10 subjects will be tested up to twice weekly in&#xD;
      the clinic for up to 2 hours per session. Respiratory response to stimulation will be&#xD;
      assessed. Once optimal parameters have been identified, electrode configuration(s) that allow&#xD;
      subjects to manipulate their respiratory pattern will be used. Subjects will be allowed to&#xD;
      use stimulator at home (daily, with identified parameters) with respiratory training in&#xD;
      addition to twice weekly testing. The same 10 subjects from Phase 4 will undergo this phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Timeline. The study is a safety and feasibility trial. This is a single arm implantation of&#xD;
      permanent electrode to assess safety and early efficacy of cervical spinal epidural&#xD;
      stimulation to improve respiratory function. It is conducted over a period of up to 6 months&#xD;
      or 21 months in 1, 2, or 3 periods, respectively (Fig. 3): Phase 1. Baseline training (up to&#xD;
      6 months), Phase 2. Temporary Trial Implant (1 day), Phase 3. Post-temporary trial implant&#xD;
      treatment (up to 10 days), Phase 4. Permanent Implant (1 day, with up to 2 months for&#xD;
      surgical recovery), Phase 5. Post-permanent implant treatment (up to 12 months). Therefore,&#xD;
      15 subjects will be involved for up to 6 months, while 12 subjects will be involved for up to&#xD;
      7 months, and 10 subjects involved for up to 21 months (18 months of testing with up to 2&#xD;
      months recovery).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Home Use. To ensure safety, the ventilator will provide support for the patient during home&#xD;
      use with stimulator turned on, just as it does when epidural stimulation is not on. The&#xD;
      patient will not be completely disconnected to the ventilator unless independence from the&#xD;
      ventilator is achieved through a gradual and very closely supervised weaning process in which&#xD;
      the patient will demonstrate stable O2 saturation and adequate minute ventilation through the&#xD;
      stages of weaning. Weaning (and evidence of improved respiratory muscle function) will&#xD;
      consist of gradually reducing the level of support delivered by the ventilator while&#xD;
      requiring that as weaning occurs, the patient maintains stable minute ventilation on his own.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To ensure safety, these weaning maneuvers will be conducted only with respiratory therapist&#xD;
      being present, and an AMBU bag with supplemental O2 will be available. Additionally, for&#xD;
      safety, the caregiver will obtain heart rate, blood pressure, temperature at 15 min intervals&#xD;
      and O2 saturation continuously, or when there is a change in the ventilator setting.&#xD;
      Additionally this will be performed only when the subject is fully conscious, awake, and&#xD;
      following commands.&#xD;
