    <textblock>
      This study is intended to investigate the usefulness of estimated glomerular filtration rate&#xD;
      (eGFR) slopes derived from retrospective routine clinical practice data, compare those&#xD;
      retrospective slopes with those generated in a prospective fashion and successively identify&#xD;
      rapidly progressing chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients.&#xD;

             disease (i.e &lt; 15 ml/min at 2 measurements 30 days apart) before start of trial&#xD;
             assessments.&#xD;
