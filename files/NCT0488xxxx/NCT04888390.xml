      This research intends to explore the effects of exercise training on the cardiopulmonary&#xD;
      function and exercise tolerance of heart failure patients with diabetes mellitus. In addition&#xD;
      to the impaired cardiac function, the clinical manifestations of patients with heart failure&#xD;
      also shown the inefficiency of pulmonary function, peripheral vascular function, and&#xD;
      musculoskeletal system. Due to low exercise tolerance, functional activities and quality of&#xD;
      life are impaired. With the high hospitalization rate and high mortality rate, the clinical&#xD;
      treatment of heart failure is challenging. At present, exercise has been listed in the&#xD;
      guidelines for the treatment of heart failure, and is recommended that patients with heart&#xD;
      failure should take regular aerobic exercise training to maintain functional activity and&#xD;
      reduce symptoms. Past studies have also suggested that exercise training can help reduce the&#xD;
      risk factors of cardiovascular disease and improve part of the cardiovascular function.&#xD;
      Furthermore, exercise can improve the quality of life and reduce the hospitalization rate.&#xD;
      Although diabetes is a common comorbidity of heart failure, and is a poor prognostic factor&#xD;
      that increases the overall risk of heart failure and cardiovascular death, there are few&#xD;
      studies in the past to further explore the benefits of exercise training for diabetes with&#xD;
      heart failure, although current studies have confirmed that regular exercise can effectively&#xD;
      control diabetes. However, the cardiopulmonary function and exercise tolerance of exercise&#xD;
      training for diabetes with heart failure still need to be clarified. Therefore, this study&#xD;
      aims to investigated the effect of cardiopulmonary function and exercise tolerance in&#xD;
      patients with heart failure. The study participants were divided into two groups: usual care&#xD;
      group and exercise group. Exercise training involved last for twelve weeks, and then follow&#xD;
      up until the sixth week after exercise training. The results of the study are expected to be&#xD;
      applied to clinical heart failure rehabilitation. It is expected that through active&#xD;
      cardiopulmonary rehabilitation combined with precise and personalized exercise prescriptions,&#xD;
      it will prevent deterioration of heart failure and may help improve the clinical practice of&#xD;
      heart failure.&#xD;
