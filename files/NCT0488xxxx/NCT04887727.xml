  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Previous studies have used a combination of oral L-[1-13C]leucine and intravenous labeled&#xD;
      L-[5,5,5-2H3]leucine to assess the acute postprandial changes in whole-body protein turnover&#xD;
      (12, 19). Intravenous and dietary-labeled amino acid tracers have also been used in tandem to&#xD;
      assess rates of myofibrillar protein synthesis in response to bolus protein ingestion and&#xD;
      resistance exercise (46). By validating whole-body net balance to myofibrillar protein&#xD;
      synthesis, our proposed multi-tracer approach will develop minimally invasive models to study&#xD;
      protein turnover in a variety of populations in which traditional infusions and/or repeated&#xD;
      blood samples are not possible (i.e. pediatric, free-living populations).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>

      The primary objective of the proposed study is to validate the use of a novel oral tracer&#xD;
      model to accurately and reliably measure myofibrillar protein synthesis. It is hypothesized&#xD;
      that oral L-[1-13C]leucine and L-[ring-2H5]phenylalanine, ingested as a bolus to mimic an&#xD;
      intravenous 'pulse dose' administration (51, 65), will reveal similar rates of myofibrillar&#xD;
      protein synthesis when compared to traditional intravenous L-[5,5,5-2H3]leucine infusion.&#xD;
      Moreover, it is hypothesized that both methods will reveal the expected graded changes in&#xD;
      myofibrillar protein synthesis in response to feeding and resistance exercise (i.e.&#xD;
      fasted&lt;feeding&lt;exercise &amp; feeding).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objective of the proposed study is to develop and validate non-invasive models&#xD;
      to measure whole-body amino acid oxidation and net balance in response to feeding and&#xD;
      resistance exercise. It is hypothesized that whole-body net balance, as determined by a novel&#xD;
      oral tracer model (i.e. L-[1-13C]leucine) , will align with traditional intravenous tracer&#xD;
      methodology (i.e. L-[5,5,5-2H3]leucine) and reveal the expected physiological changes in&#xD;
      whole-body protein turnover in response to feeding and resistance exercise (i.e.&#xD;
      fasted&lt;feeding&lt;exercise &amp; feeding).&#xD;
