  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      High-frequency alternating currents of greater than 1 kHz applied on peripheral nerves has&#xD;
      been used in animal studies to produce a motor nerve block. It has been evidenced that&#xD;
      frequencies higher than 5 kHz are necessary to produce a complete peripheral nerve block in&#xD;
      primates, whose nerve thickness is more similar to humans.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The previous studies with transcutaneous and percutaneous HFAC, suggest high-frequency&#xD;
      stimulation (10 and 20 kHz) have an inhibitory effect over muscle strength and somatosensory&#xD;
      threshold.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, the 30 kHz frequency has never been applied, and the hypothesis is that it can&#xD;
      produce a greater blockage at the sensitive level and be a more comfortable application for&#xD;
      the patient. The purpose of the present work is to determine if a greater blockage of the&#xD;
      sensory component of the nerve occurs with this frequency and is to reduce the amount of&#xD;
      current intensity needed using a percutaneous approach by apply two acupuncture needles near&#xD;
      the nerve as electrodes.&#xD;
