      This multi-center, international, randomized, open-label, post-market study will enroll&#xD;
      subjects to detail the results of robotic-assisted PCI using technIQ automated movements in&#xD;
      real-world clinical practice by randomized comparison with a cohort of subjects undergoing&#xD;
      robotic-assisted PCI with technIQ automated movements disabled. A secondary objective is to&#xD;
      describe the learning curve associated with using technIQ.&#xD;

    <time_frame>During the Procedure</time_frame>
    <description>Planned manual conversion (PMC) is disengagement of the robotic drive to use bedside manipulation of either the guide catheter, guidewire, or delivery system that was prespecified in the procedural plan (e.g., to accommodate adjunctive devices or procedural techniques that are not compatible with the robotic platform, such as intravascular ultrasound or atherectomy devices). This will be assessed by a questionnaire.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Unplanned Manual Conversion (UMC)</measure>
    <time_frame>During the Procedure</time_frame>
    <description>Unplanned manual conversion (UMC) is disengagement of the robotic drive to use bedside manipulation of either the guide catheter, guidewire, or delivery system that was not prespecified in the procedural plan, and that was due to inability to navigate to the target lesion as intended, cross the target lesion as intended, treat the target lesion as intended, retract the CorPath GRX system as intended, or other CorPath system device malfunction; or any clinical condition that requires rapid medical intervention. This will be assessed by a questionnaire.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Partial Manual Assistance (PMA)</measure>
    <time_frame>During the Procedure</time_frame>
    <description>Partial manual assistance (PMA) is the use of manual techniques that were not prespecified in the procedural plan and do not meet the definition of unplanned manual conversion (e.g., unplanned use of manual techniques to accommodate adjunctive devices or procedural techniques that are not compatible with the robotic platform). These will be assessed by a questionnaire.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Device Malfunction</measure>
    <time_frame>During the Procedure</time_frame>
    <description>The device malfunction will report the inadequacy of the medical device with respect to its identity, quality, durability, reliability, usability, safety, or performance.

TechnIQ automated movements are software-based automation of common maneuvers that interventionalists perform when manipulating catheters, guidewires, and devices by hand. In this group, automated movements will be enabled and used at the discretion of the interventionalist.</description>
