      The study will provide information on cognitive impairment and Health related quality of life&#xD;
      in patients surviving 12 months after acute brain injury, generate a hypothesis of useful&#xD;
      variables to predict cognitive impairment or low levels of HRQoL, and potentially inform&#xD;
      interventions for the prevention and treatment of cognitive impairment following neuro-ICU&#xD;
      stay.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The aim is to 1) measure the frequency and extent of cognitive impairment after acute brain&#xD;
      injury at six and 12-months after neuro-Intensive care unit (ICU) admission 2) explore the&#xD;
      association between cognitive impairment at six and 12 months after ICU admission with the&#xD;
      following potential risk factors: duration of ICU delirium (days), duration of sepsis (days),&#xD;
      duration of post traumatic amnesia (days) and the severity of brain injury (initial Glasgow&#xD;
      Coma Scale , 3) describe Health related quality of life, functional disability and frailty at&#xD;
      six and 12 after ICU admission and 4) explore the association between the functional&#xD;
      disability, frailty and health-related quality of life at 12 months after ICU admission&#xD;
