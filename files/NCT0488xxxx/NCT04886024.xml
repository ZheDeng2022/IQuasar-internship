      Serum AGES (Advanced Glycation End Products) levels of endometriosis patients are compared&#xD;
      with a group of healthy volunteers of the same age.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Serum AGES (Advanced Glycation End Products) levels are compared with 45 endometriosis&#xD;
      patients and 45 healthy volunteers of the same age. The energy metabolism of the&#xD;
      endometriosis group and its possible relationship with the endometriosis stage will be&#xD;
      compared since AGES (Advanced Glycation End Products) gives information about the energy&#xD;
      metabolism of the people.&#xD;

    <measure>Comparison of the relationship between serum Serum Advanced Glycation End Products (AGEs) level and endometriosis stage</measure>
    <time_frame>8 months</time_frame>
    <description>By comparing the relation of serum Advanced Glycation End Products (AGEs) level with the stage of endometriosis, its relation with serum level in patients with advanced and early stage endometriosis will be examined. The possible effect of Advanced Glycation End Products (AGEs) on disease pathogenesis will be examined.</description>
