  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      NAFLD is increasingly being identified in lean individuals, especially in Chinese population.&#xD;
      Among the NAFLD patients, the lean NAFLD accounts for 15.9%-23.0%. Previous studies showed&#xD;
      that the lean NAFLD individuals might have a higher risk of severe hepatic disease than those&#xD;
      obese individuals. However, the effects of aerobic exercise on the reduction of liver fat&#xD;
      content and metabolic risk factors in lean NAFLD individuals remain unknown. In this&#xD;
      randomized controlled trial, we will examine the effect of a 6-month exercise training&#xD;
      (aerobic exercise versus resistance exercise) on liver fat content and metabolic risk factors&#xD;
      in lean NAFLD individuals.&#xD;

      The whole study is divided into four phases: recruitment phase, training phase (1 month, aim&#xD;
      to gradually adapt patients to the target exercise intensity), implementation phase (6&#xD;
      months), and follow-up phase (6 months). And the subjects are randomly assigned to two&#xD;
      groups: aerobic exercise intervention group and control group.&#xD;
