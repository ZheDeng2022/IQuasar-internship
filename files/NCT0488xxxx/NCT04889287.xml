  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Researchers are looking for a better way to treat people who have symptoms caused by hormonal&#xD;
      changes, like those that happen in women during menopause. These symptoms can include&#xD;
      vasomotor symptoms. Before a treatment can be approved for patients to take, researchers do&#xD;
      clinical studies to better understand its safety and what happens to the treatment in the&#xD;
      body.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study drug, elinzanetant, was designed to treat vasomotor symptoms. Rosuvastatin is&#xD;
      already approved for doctors to prescribe and is used to treat high cholesterol levels and&#xD;
      prevent heart problems. It is important for researchers to know if taking elinzanetant will&#xD;
      affect how other drugs work in the body. Researchers regularly use rosuvastatin in studies to&#xD;
      learn how it affects drugs like elinzanetant.In this study, the researchers will study how&#xD;
      much elinzanetant gets into the participants' blood when taken with or without rosuvastatin.&#xD;
      The study will include about 16 male participants who are between 18 and 65 years old. The&#xD;
      participants will all take 5 milligrams (mg) of rosuvastatin and 120 mg of elinzanetant as&#xD;
      capsules by mouth. On some days, they will take only rosuvastatin or only elinzanetant. On&#xD;
      other days, they will take both study treatments. Each participant will be in the study for&#xD;
      up to 6 weeks. But, the entire study will last about 2.5 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the study, all of the participants will stay at the study site for 17 days. Blood and&#xD;
      urine samples will be collected. The physician will also check the participants' heart health&#xD;
      using an electrocardiogram (ECG). The participants will answer questions about how their well&#xD;
      being and taken medications.&#xD;
