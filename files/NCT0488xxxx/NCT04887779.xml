  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Using a prospective qualitative approach, explore whether pathologist intervention is&#xD;
      feasible as part of multimodal multidisciplinary care model for transplant patients in&#xD;
      effecting psychological dimensions such as experience, satisfaction, or patient's&#xD;
      understanding of their disease. Additionally, to examine if this intervention improves&#xD;
      medication adherence.&#xD;

      Specific Aims 1. Create post-transplant pathologist-led intervention Objective 1a: Recruit 10&#xD;
      patients who have undergone lung transplantation primarily for chronic obstructive pulmonary&#xD;
      disease (COPD). Use pathologist to show gross/microscopic explanted organs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 2. Assess the efficacy of intervention pilot Objective 2a: Immediate (within 1&#xD;
      day after pathologist intervention) phone interview to access patient's reaction, feelings,&#xD;
      and experience with intervention and understanding of disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective 2b: 1 month later, phone interview asking questions related to medication&#xD;
      adherence, patient experience with intervention and lung transplant overall, and patient&#xD;
      understanding of disease. Results will be compared to first interview.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective 2c: Analyze Client Satisfaction Questionnaire (CSQ-8) for quality of life, Basel&#xD;
      assessment of adherence to immunosuppressive medications scale (BAASIS) as a self report&#xD;
      adherence measure, and conduct a mixed methods/grounded theory analysis of qualitative data&#xD;
      (patient experience, disease understanding). This analysis will systematically identify&#xD;
      themes, and assign these descriptive words.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 3: Finalize intervention protocol based on pilot testing. Objective 3a. Adjust&#xD;
      and refine the content and process of intervention protocol based on findings of pilot study&#xD;
      Objective 3b. Final changes will assure readiness for large scale study.&#xD;

    <measure>Basel Assessment of Adherence to Immunosuppressive Medication Scale (BAASIS©)</measure>
    <time_frame>one day after intervention and assessment for change one month later</time_frame>
    <description>The Basel Assessment of Adherence to Immunosuppressive Medication Scale (BAASIS©) was developed to assess adherence to immunosuppressive drugs in adult and adolescent transplant recipients. Initiation starts when a patient takes his/her first dose of medication. This is a binary event (yes/no). Implementation of the dosing regimen refers to &quot;the extent to which a patient's actual dosing corresponds to the prescribed dosing regimen, from initiation until the last dose is taken&quot; and implies a dosing history.&#xD;
Discontinuation refers to &quot;the moment that the patient discontinues his/her medication regimen&quot; and is assessed as a time to event. Persistence is thus the duration between time of initiation and the moment the last dose is taken. Any yes response demonstrates issues with medication adherence.</description>

    <measure>Client Satisfaction Questionnaire (CSQ-8)</measure>
    <time_frame>one day after intervention and assessment for change one month later</time_frame>
    <description>The Client Satisfaction Questionnaire is an 8 item measure of client satisfaction. An &quot;overall score&quot; is calculated by summing the respondent's rating (item rating) score for each scale item. Scores therefore range from 8 to 32, with higher values indicating higher satisfaction. with services with both a parent intervention versus averages of lung transplant patients.</description>
