  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The global burden and threat of non-communicable diseases (NCDs) have become a major health&#xD;
      challenge that undermines social and economic development throughout the world.&#xD;
      Cardiovascular disease including acute coronary syndromes (ACS) currently accounts for 17.9&#xD;
      million deaths a year. Low and middle-income countries such as those in sub-Saharan Africa&#xD;
      (SSA) have undergone a rapid epidemiological transition over the last few decades and now&#xD;
      have a burden of disease increasingly dominated by NCDs. The global burden of disease report&#xD;
      for 2017 revealed a 71.4% increase in cardiovascular disease in SSA, predicting a large&#xD;
      increase in mortality. Unfortunately, reliable population-level data regarding the incidence,&#xD;
      prevalence and demographics of ACS in SSA are limited. The investigators propose to set up&#xD;
      and conduct a multi-centre, prospective, observational registry to describe the demographics,&#xD;
      clinical characteristics, presentation, management and outcomes of patients admitted with ACS&#xD;
      in Cape Town and the Garden Route Health District, Western Cape Province, South Africa. The&#xD;
      registry is designed to shed insight on the current burden and impact of atherosclerotic&#xD;
      cardiovascular disease in the Western Cape.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The investigators propose to set up and conduct a multi-centre, prospective, observational&#xD;
      registry to describe the demographics, clinical characteristics, presentation, management and&#xD;
      outcomes of patients admitted with ACS in Cape Town and the Garden Route Health District,&#xD;
      Western Cape Province, South Africa.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aims of this prospective multi-centre registry are to describe the burden, demographics,&#xD;
      risk factor profile, clinical course, management, and outcomes of patients presenting with&#xD;
      ACS across the Cape Town metropole and the Garden Route Health District. The registry will be&#xD;
      called &quot;the PrEsentation, Rationale and impact of reperFUSION for Acute Coronary Syndromes in&#xD;
      Cape Town - the PERFUSION registry&quot;. It will be designed to determine the feasibility of&#xD;
      conducting a large multi-centre Acute Coronary Syndrome registry in South Africa.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. to enrol consecutive patients presenting with acute coronary syndromes from designated&#xD;
           participating sites;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. to describe the demographic and risk factor profile of participants with ACS;&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. to describe the burden of patients presenting with ACS in the Cape Town metropole and&#xD;
           the Garden Route Health District;&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. to describe the management of patients with ACS and assess compliance with current South&#xD;
           African guidelines;&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. to describe the one month, six-month and 12-month outcomes with regard to all-cause&#xD;
           mortality, hospitalisation, and major adverse cardiac events (recurrence of ACS, heart&#xD;
           failure, stroke and ventricular tachy-arrythmias).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Registry design The PERFUSION registry will enrol consecutive consenting adults (≥ 18 years)&#xD;
      admitted to participating healthcare centres in the cities of Cape Town and the Garden Route&#xD;
      Health District, Western Cape, South Africa. Depending on available capacity and resources,&#xD;
      the registry may be expanded to other healthcare centres in the Western Cape and other&#xD;
      provinces of South Africa.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As this is fundamentally an observational study, all participants enrolled will receive&#xD;
      management based on local standard of care guidelines. Participant management will not be&#xD;
      affected by recruitment into this study. By using the hub/ spoke/ pre-spoke model, all&#xD;
      patients presenting with an ACS to a designated public healthcare care facility in the Cape&#xD;
      Town metropole and the Garden Route Health District will be screened for study eligibility&#xD;
      criteria. Screening will occur at hub and spoke levels only. Designated site PI's will&#xD;
      identify potential study participants meeting eligibility criteria during their index ACS&#xD;
      admission. Once screened according to the study's inclusion and exclusion criteria, potential&#xD;
      participants will be consented for study participation. Clinical information fulfilling&#xD;
      pre-defined registry variables will be entered into a standardised paper-based case report&#xD;
      form (CRF) or electronic CFR and uploaded onto a secure data collection web application&#xD;
      called the Research Electronic Data Capture (REDCap) by the study's data capturers. Upon data&#xD;
      entry, participants will be immediately assigned a unique identifier generated by REDCap to&#xD;
      maintain confidentiality. The REDCap database is governed by strict password-controlled&#xD;
      access, assigned only to approved study team members.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The database variables collected for this registry are in line with the American College of&#xD;
      Cardiology Foundation / American Heart Association Task Force on Key Data Elements. These&#xD;
      include data pertaining to patient demographics; comorbidities and prior medication; index&#xD;
      ACS presentation at the pre-spoke, spoke or hub level; ECG features; echocardiography;&#xD;
      laboratory investigations; management and treatment received at the pre-spoke, spoke or hub&#xD;
      level; angiography; complications of therapies and interventions; and outcomes (in-hospital,&#xD;
      1 month, 6 month and 1 year).&#xD;
&#xD;
      To limit an additional burden on the healthcare system, the investigators plan on&#xD;
      following-up participants electronically using the Western Cape Provincial Health Data Centre&#xD;
      (PHDC) and Single Patient Viewer (SPV) online tool over a period of 1-year after the index&#xD;
      ACS presentation. The investigators have received both HREC and provincial permission for the&#xD;
      utilisation of data from the PHDC and SPV for this research. Follow-up data will be uploaded&#xD;
      directly onto REDCap and anonymised.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The key outcomes of interest will include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. mortality (all-cause and cardiovascular);&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. recurrent and re-infarction myocardial infarction;&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. new-onset heart failure and arrhythmia complications;&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. cerebrovascular events;&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. major bleeding events;&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. repeat hospitalisation for any cause.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The extended list of all variables collected will be found on the registry's CRF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Benefits of registry participation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although there are no direct study benefits to the participant, the study will indirectly&#xD;
      improve our knowledge of acute coronary syndromes in South Africa. By providing local&#xD;
      reliable evidence in our resource constraint environment, the investigators may improve the&#xD;
      standard of care provided to patients with ACS and possibly identify novel cardioprotective&#xD;
      strategies that may help reduce the burden of ACS in South Africa.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Risk of registry participation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The PERFUSION registry is designed to be a prospective, observational registry. Participant&#xD;
      enrolment will not deviate management from local standard of care guidelines. There is no&#xD;
      investigational medicinal product, drug or device practised in this protocol. Participation&#xD;
      in this study has no physical, psychological, social, economic or legal risk. For people who&#xD;
      do not want to take part in the study, routine standard of care will be maintained.&#xD;
