  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The evaluation of diaphragm function in ventilated patients is not easy. One option is to use&#xD;
      esophageal pressure (Pes) measurements but recently, diaphragmatic ultrasound has proven&#xD;
      itself as a useful tool in this setting. In adults the thickening fraction (TF), which&#xD;
      describes the difference in thickness between end-inspiration and end-expiration, correlates&#xD;
      with the diaphragmatic pressure-time product per breath (PTPdi), an esophageal&#xD;
      pressure-derived work of breathing parameter. There is a lack of data that tells us whether&#xD;
      the same is true in children. This physiological study intends to look at the correlation&#xD;
      between esophageal pressures and thickening fraction assessed by ultrasound in a pediatric&#xD;
      cohort of patients.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The gold standard in evaluating lung mechanics is the esophageal pressure. And although&#xD;
      diaphragm ultrasound has been reported to be feasible in assessing diaphragm activity in&#xD;
      sedated patients, no study has thus far looked at the relationship between the ultrasound&#xD;
      parameters (i.e. thickening fraction) and the esophageal pressure. This is a single-centre&#xD;
      physiological cohort study to evaluate the feasibility of using the thickening fraction as a&#xD;
      parameter for diaphragm activity during spontaneous breathing in sedated children. Data will&#xD;
      be collected during an elective surgical procedure with a patient under general anesthesia.&#xD;
      If the patient's legal representative provides written informed consent, the patient is&#xD;
      enrolled in the study before start of the anesthetic procedure and the trial ends on the&#xD;
      moment of removal of the laryngeal mask.The registration of the physiological data will not&#xD;
      interfere with the surgery.The thickening fraction (using ultrasound) and pressure&#xD;
      measurements will be performed simultaneously and repetitive during different loads on the&#xD;
      respiratory system.Esophageal pressures (Pes) will be measured with a single air-filled&#xD;
      balloon catheter(AVEA™ smarthcath pediatric 7 Fr, Vyaire Medical Inc., IL, USA). The balloon&#xD;
      catheter will be inserted nasally after the induction of anesthesia. The catheter will then&#xD;
      be connected to a pressure transducer (FluxMed, MBMED, Argentina). The appropriate placement&#xD;
      will be checked by commonly used methods. Firstly, the appropriate depth of insertion will be&#xD;
      estimated by measuring the nose-ear-xyphoid distance, which is the distance from the nose to&#xD;
      the diaphragm. Secondly, the balloon catheter will be inserted more deeply than this&#xD;
      predicted distance, placing it in the stomach, and a positive pressure swing when mild&#xD;
      abdominal pressure is exerted on a slightly inflated balloon will be noted. Thirdly, when&#xD;
      retracted into the esophagus, cardiac reflections on the pressure monitor will appear.&#xD;
      Fourth, when applying positive pressure ventilation, we will look for a positive deflection&#xD;
      on the pressure curve. The output from the pressure transducer will be saved from the Fluxmed&#xD;
      respiratory mechanics monitor. Pes will be measured over at least five consecutive breaths&#xD;
      selected at the end of the pressure recordings. Ultrasound recordings will be done with the&#xD;
      BK 3500 ultrasound machine, using a linear high-resolution probe. The parameter measured is&#xD;
      the distance between the pleura and peritoneum as seen on a 2D image. The thickness using&#xD;
      B-mode ultrasound imaging at end expiration on 10cm H2O of positive end-expiratory pressure&#xD;
      (PEEP) and on zero PEEP (ZEEP) will be assessed. Furthermore, the thickness with Mmode&#xD;
      imaging, both at end-inspiration (TEI) and end-expiration (TEE) will be measured. A&#xD;
      transducer will be placed on the right side of the body in the midaxillary line at the level&#xD;
      of the 8th and 9th intercostal space, the so-called zone of apposition. The probe will be&#xD;
      positioned perpendicular to the skin, and temporary markings will be applied to the skin.&#xD;
      Subjects are positioned in a supine position. TEE will be measured just before the thickening&#xD;
      start and TEI measured at maximal thickening. Measurements will be averaged out of three or&#xD;
      more consecutive breaths. The thickening fraction (TF) is calculated as (TEI - TEE)/TEE and&#xD;
      expressed as a percentage. Digital images will be stored and re-interpreted by a separate,&#xD;
      blinded interpreter.The thickening fraction recordings will be repeated during different&#xD;
      loads on the respiratory system, with varying the depth of anesthesia (mean alveolar&#xD;
      concentration of anesthetic vapor - MAC) and different added respiratory loads with a&#xD;
      threshold valve and different levels of PEEP. An anesthesia circle circuit with standard&#xD;
      pediatric tubing will consistently be used. The lowest dose of opioids will be used to the&#xD;
      extent clinically possible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Condition #1: during positive pressure ventilation, no spontaneous breaths Condition #2:&#xD;
      spontaneous, MAC 1.5, PEEP, no added respiratory load Condition #3: spontaneous, MAC 1.5,&#xD;
      PEEP 10, no added respiratory load (only Tdi, no TF) Condition #4: spontaneous, MAC 1.5,&#xD;
      ZEEP, no extra added respiratory load Condition #5: spontaneous, MAC 1, ZEEP, no added&#xD;
      respiratory load Condition #6: spontaneous, MAC 1, ZEEP, 7 cm H2O added respiratory load&#xD;
      Condition #7: spontaneous, MAC 1, ZEEP, 15 cm H2O added respiratory load&#xD;
&#xD;
      These different conditions will alter the work of breathing the diaphragm has to perform and&#xD;
      will allow us to better correlate thickening fraction with esophageal pressure.Preceding this&#xD;
      study, a reproducibility study will assess intra-observer reproducibility for the researcher&#xD;
      doing the ultrasound measurements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A power analysis is not possible, as this is the first study comparing these parameters in&#xD;
      children. Data will be analyzed using the SPSS statistical software package (SPSS Inc., IL,&#xD;
      USA). Continuous variables will be reported as median (interquartile range). Friedman test&#xD;
      and Wilcoxon paired tests (with post hoc Bonferonni correction) will be used to assess&#xD;
      differences between related variables. Correlations between TF and Pes will be calculated&#xD;
      using the Spearman method and performed for the entire data set (including all four&#xD;
      respiratory conditions of each patient) because of the limited sample size. Two-tailed p&#xD;
      values less than 0.05 will be considered significant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All precautions will be taken to prevent complications due to placement of the balloon&#xD;
      catheter but nevertheless all adverse events will be assessed.&#xD;
