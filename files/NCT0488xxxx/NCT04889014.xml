  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the use of personal genomic educational testing&#xD;
      (PGET) on student knowledge and clinical skills surrounding pharmacogenomic testing to ensure&#xD;
      it is of educational benefit to our student population. Students will be provided the&#xD;
      opportunity to opt-in to test their own pharmacogenomic panel while participating in the&#xD;
      standard curriculum. Students will have the option of using their own reports or dummy&#xD;
      reports during classroom activities. Our hypothesis is that those students who have their own&#xD;
      pharmacogenomics tested will show better overall performance.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>We investigated the effect of PGET on student knowledge, comfort, and attitudes related to pharmacogenomics (PGx) in a non-blinded, randomized controlled trial. Consenting participants were randomized to receive PGET or no PGET (NPGET) during four subsequent years of a PGx course.</intervention_model_description>
