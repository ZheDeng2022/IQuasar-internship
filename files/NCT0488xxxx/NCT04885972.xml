      This study is a multi-center, Phase 2, randomized, dose ranging, assessor-blinded, active and&#xD;
      placebo-controlled, parallel-group prospective study evaluating the efficacy and safety of a&#xD;
      single IA injection of various RTX doses, Zilretta or placebo for the treatment of pain due&#xD;
      to moderate to severe osteoarthritis knee pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A planned 112 subjects will be randomized to one of 7 groups (n=16 each) with each subject&#xD;
      receiving one IA injection in the index knee joint (the knee primarily affected by pain if&#xD;
      bilateral).&#xD;

             available for review)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have had treatment failure with at least two prior analgesic agents (at least one&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Have had an IA injection in the index knee within one month prior to screening (3&#xD;
             months if prior IA injection with Zilretta)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have undergone arthroscopic or open surgery or replacement surgery to the index knee&#xD;

             assess pain in the index knee&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  If on opioid analgesics to treat knee OA, have an upper limit of 30 mg/day as&#xD;
