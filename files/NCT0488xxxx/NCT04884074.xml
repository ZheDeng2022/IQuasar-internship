    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to evaluate the superiority of anterior crural repair during&#xD;
      sleeve gastrectomy over no repair in decreasing the incidence of gastroesophageal reflux&#xD;
      disease.&#xD;

      Introduction Obesity is a global pandemic. The prevalence of overweight and obesity is&#xD;
      increasing globally. Together with its co-morbidities, obesity substantially decreased&#xD;
      quality of life and life expectancy. Bariatric surgery has been shown to provide substantial&#xD;
      and sustained effects on weight loss and ameliorates obesity-related comorbidities. Among&#xD;
      different bariatric procedures, laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) is increasingly being&#xD;
      performed due to the favorable bariatric outcome, simplicity of the procedure and relatively&#xD;
      low complication profile as compared to bypass procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Development of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD is a major health concern after LSG. It&#xD;
      has been observed in the bariatric surgical community that many patients are complaining of&#xD;
      persisted GERD symptoms after LSG surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aiming to avoid post-operative GERD, hiatal dissection with crural repair had been suggested&#xD;
      to be performed on top of the sleeve gastrectomy procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Collection Baseline data collection: All potential candidates will be screened for&#xD;
      secondary causes of obesity, such as hypothyroidism and Cushing's syndrome, and are assessed&#xD;
      for severity of obesity-related diseases including hypertension, diabetes mellitus,&#xD;
      obstructive sleep apnoea syndrome and hyperlipidaemia. Extensive counseling will be given and&#xD;
      potential benefits and complications of treatments will be discussed with all participants at&#xD;
      least 4 weeks prior to recruitment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedure data: Operative time, blood loss and total hospital stay are captured&#xD;
      prospectively. All peri-operative complications will be documented and graded according to&#xD;
      the Clavien-Dindo Classification System to facilitate comparison.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up and assessment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be followed up at a designated Multi-disciplinary Clinic of Metabolic and&#xD;
      Bariatric Surgery at 4 weeks, 3 months, 6 months, 9 months and 1 year after the operation. A&#xD;
      standard dietary and exercise regimen will be prescribed to the patients, and their&#xD;
      compliance to the life-style modification is monitored by designated dietitians. Counselling&#xD;
      will be provided whenever necessary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      They are assessed for symptomatology according to a standard checklist by independent&#xD;
      assessors who are blind to the mode of surgery performed. Data collection and blood tests,&#xD;
      endoscopy and esophageal function test (see below) will be carried out during clinic visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adherence to Good Clinical Practices (GCPs) This trial will reference the international&#xD;
      ethical principles endorsed by the World Medical Association Declaration of Helsinki as well&#xD;
      as ICH/GCP Standards, and any other applicable local laws or regulations&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Completion and Record Keeping The hard-copy of patients' medical records will be kept in&#xD;
      the Prince of Wales Hospital and the electronic information regarding patient information&#xD;
      will be stored in the University/Hospital computer and password encrypted. Only the principle&#xD;
      investigator, co-investigator and the research nurse will have the right to access these&#xD;
      data. Data will be stored for 5 years and after completion of study, both hard &amp; soft copy of&#xD;
      the patients &amp; study data will be destroyed and deleted of a body function or damage to a&#xD;
      body structure.&#xD;

    <intervention_name>Standard Sleeve Gastrectomy plus Anterior Crural Repair</intervention_name>
    <description>The procedure is performed in a similar fashion as standard sleeve gastrectomy. After gastric mobilization is completed as standard sleeve gastrectomy, the anterior phrenoesophageal ligament is divided and distal 3cm esophagus is mobilized. A Mid-Sleeve tube (40Fr) is inserted per-orally by the anesthetist and the hiatus opening is closed with 2/0 non-absorbable suture over the bougie anterior to the esophagus. The hiatus repair was sized by comfortably placement a dissection forceps adjacent to the esophagus without tension. Sleeve gastrectomy is then performed as the standard technique.</description>

    <intervention_name>Standard sleeve gastrectomy (SSG, the control group)</intervention_name>
    <description>The procedure is performed in French position with a standard 5-port approach and a pneumoperitoneum not exceeding 15mmHg.&#xD;
The greater omentum is then completely detached from the greater curvature of stomach using either ultrasonic or bipolar shear device. All adhesion between posterior gastric wall and pancreatic capsule is freed and the cardia is completely free with left crura completely exposed. A Mid-Sleeve tube (40Fr) is inserted per-orally by the anesthetist with its balloon tip reaching the gastric antrum and insufflated with 50cc of air. Sleeve gastrectomy is then performed using laparoscopic linear staplers, starting from a point 5-6cm proximal to the pylorus up cardia at about 1cm lateral to the angle of His, along the Mid-sleeve tube which is lying against the lesser curve of stomach. The staple line is reinforced with absorbable sutures. Distal stomach is anchored at retroperitoneum with non-absorbable stitch.</description>
