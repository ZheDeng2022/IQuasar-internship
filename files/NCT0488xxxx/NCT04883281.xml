  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Varian Medical Systems has recently deployed a completely novel radiation treatment system&#xD;
      called EthosTM, a first-of-its-kind system that allows for daily adapative radiotherapy&#xD;
      (DART), such that the treatment for that day can be created on-the-fly based on the patient's&#xD;
      current positioning and anatomy. This system is commercially-available and FDA-approved, and&#xD;
      UTSW Radiation Oncology has installed two such units. The ability to adjust the dose delivery&#xD;
      every day means both that adaptive therapy is possible with every fraction and that the PTV&#xD;
      margin can be dramatically reduced/eliminated, since investigators are treating for that&#xD;
      day's patient setup. Investigators are therefore proposing a randomized trial using DART with&#xD;
      near marginless (ML) setup margins (a 1 mm margin will be retained for intrafractional&#xD;
      motion).&#xD;

      IMRT with daily cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) set up is the current recommended&#xD;
      radiation technique for head and neck squamous cell carcinoma. The conformality of IMRT has&#xD;
      made it possible to reduce dose to normal tissues, but it also predisposes the treatments to&#xD;
      drastic delivered dose deviations due to changes in the patient (e.g. weight loss, muscle&#xD;
      atrophy, or normal tissue edema) or in the tumor (e.g. treatment response or treatment&#xD;
      related edema). These changes can create poor coverage and/or cold spots in the tumor and&#xD;
      increased coverage and/or hot spots in the normal organs at risk. Image guidance with CBCTs&#xD;
      can help reduce set up error between treatments, but image guidance can't adjust for these&#xD;
      patient or tumor changes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adaptive radiotherapy (ART) is the process of replanning the patient's radiation plan by&#xD;
      adjusting the target structures, organs at risk structures, and optimal radiation delivery&#xD;
      during the radiation therapy course. ART allows treating physicians to account for all the&#xD;
      patient or tumor changes that can't be currently resolved with image guidance. Previously,&#xD;
      ART was a prohibitively resource and time-consuming process that could only be performed once&#xD;
      or twice during a conventional 6.5 to 7-week head and neck radiation treatment course in&#xD;
      select patients with substantial structural changes. However, with the recent advent of&#xD;
      adaptive software, ART can now be performed on a daily basis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The data on the possible advantages of ART in head and neck cancer is still limited to small,&#xD;
      mostly pre-clinical studies. In a feasibility study, five patients with locally advanced&#xD;
      HPV-positive oropharynx cancer undergoing definitive chemoradiation underwent an MRI every&#xD;
      two weeks during their treatment. The results showed an average decrease in the primary tumor&#xD;
      GTV volume of 44%, 90%, and 100% and an average decrease in the nodal GTV volume of 25%, 60%,&#xD;
      and 80% by at weeks 2, 4, and 6 weeks, respectively. Another similar study on eight patients&#xD;
      saw an average 70% GTV volume reduction by week 6.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to tumor coverage, parotid glands are of particular interest in ART because of&#xD;
      their radiosensitivity and association with xerostomia and decreased quality of life.&#xD;
      Toxicity of salivary glands are related to dose as a continuous variable, so even modest&#xD;
      decreases in dose can have a clinical impact. The average volume of the parotids has been&#xD;
      reported to decrease as much as 14.7%, 37%, and 48% by the end of weeks 2, 4, and 7. The&#xD;
      parotid glands also appear to shift superiorly and medially during treatment. Feasibility ART&#xD;
      studies have shown that the dose to the parotid may decrease by as much as 5.5 Gy with ART.&#xD;
      Therefore ART holds the promise of preserving the expected dose distribution to salivary&#xD;
      OARs, improving long-term patient outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The ability to ensure coverage of the target structures and proper avoidance of organs at&#xD;
      risk on a daily basis also greatly improves the confidence of the daily set-up and targeting.&#xD;
      Current recommended radial PTV margins with daily CBCT are 3-5 mm, with even larger margins&#xD;
      recommended for patients at risk of larger inter-fraction variability. These PTV margins are&#xD;
      built to ensure the disease is not missed by the treatment due to daily setup error. However,&#xD;
      these margins also significantly increase the irradiated volume, since the volume increases&#xD;
      exponentially with each additional millimeter. Therefore, decreasing margins, even by a few&#xD;
      millimeters, can results in large changes in treatment volume and improvement in toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a retrospective Danish analysis of patients treated with 5 mm versus 3 mm PTV margins,&#xD;
      Navran et al. noted that acute grade 3 toxicity (65% vs 53.8%, p = 0.008) and late grade 3&#xD;
      dysphagia (20.4% vs 11.1%, p = 0.012) were significantly lower in the smaller margin group.&#xD;
      There were no differences in disease outcomes between the two groups. In a retrospective&#xD;
      study analyzing the benefit of changing the margin on gross disease from 8 mm to 5 mm, just a&#xD;
      3 mm difference, Samuels et al. found that plans with the smaller PTV margin had a clinically&#xD;
      meaningful improvement in the normal tissue complication probability for the ipsilateral&#xD;
      parotid gland and contralateral submandibular gland when compared to conventional PTV margin&#xD;
      plans. In fact, 40% of patients would have theoretically experienced an improvement in the&#xD;
      function of both of these glands, just by modestly shrinking the PTV.&#xD;
