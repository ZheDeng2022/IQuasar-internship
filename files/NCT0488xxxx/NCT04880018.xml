    <textblock>
      Through follow-up for 1 year or more, the safety and effectiveness of the Capsular Tension&#xD;
      Ring produced by Eyebright Medical Technology (Beijing) Co., Ltd. were verified, which is&#xD;
      used for intraocular lens implantation in aphakic eyes after lens extraction to maintain&#xD;
      capsular integrity, prevent posterior capsular wrinkle and resist capsular shrinkage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The clinical validation plan will be implemented after being approved by the Ethics&#xD;
      Committee; the trial data of all cases before the 6-month visit period will be counted, and&#xD;
      the statistical report, summary report and sub-center summary will be issued. The summary&#xD;
      report and sub-center summary will be submitted to the CFDA for product registration.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      According to the principle of &quot;Quality management standard for clinical trials of medical&#xD;
      devices&quot; issued by CFDA, a multi-center, randomized, open, positive product, parallel&#xD;
      controlled trial design was adopted to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the Capsular&#xD;
      Tension Ring produced by Eyebright Medical Technology (Beijing) Co., Ltd.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Considering the progress of clinical verification and the reliability of the conclusion, the&#xD;
      multi-center trial design was adopted in this clinical verification. Multi-center clinical&#xD;
      trials can collect more cases in a short time, and cover a wide population of cases, which&#xD;
      avoids the limitations of a single research, and the conclusions can have a wider&#xD;
      significance and greater credibility. In order to demonstrate the effectiveness and safety of&#xD;
      the product, and to verify whether the product has the same efficacy and safety as the&#xD;
      marketed product, a positive product and a parallel controlled trial design were selected for&#xD;
      the validation; The &quot;Capsular Tension Ring&quot; produced by Carl Zeiss, with the same material,&#xD;
      structure, design, implantation mode and location, and indications, was selected as the&#xD;
      positive parallel control product, and the clinical trial was conducted simultaneously with&#xD;
      the validation product. In view of the fact that this clinical trial is a comparative&#xD;
      research of positive products and parallel controls, in order to ensure the comparability of&#xD;
      cases in each group, avoid bias caused by various factors in the design, execution, and&#xD;
      analysis of the clinical trial. This clinical verification adopts a randomization method and&#xD;
      uses a central random system to achieve dynamic randomization to ensure that cases are evenly&#xD;
      allocated to the test group or the control group. Due to the variety of product&#xD;
      specifications in this clinical verification, the use of the verification product and the&#xD;
      reference substance is slightly different. This verification cannot be double-blind, so an&#xD;
      open clinical trial design is adopted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on the above considerations and adhering to the scientific principle, in order to&#xD;
      verify the safety and effectiveness of the Capsular Tension Ring produced by Eyebright, a&#xD;
      multi-center, randomized, open, positive product, parallel controlled trial method was&#xD;
      adopted in this clinical verification.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the same time, 120 cases of cataract patients were selected according to the statistical&#xD;
      requirements. After screening and examination, those who met the inclusion criteria were&#xD;
      selected for validation. Surgical treatment and implantation of validation or control&#xD;
      products were performed. Clinical follow-up evaluation was planned at 1-2 days, 1 week, 1&#xD;
      month, 3 months, 6 months and 1 year after operation. The percentage of patients whose best&#xD;
      corrected visual acuity reached 20/40 at 6 months after operation was taken as the main&#xD;
      efficacy indicator; At the same time, observe the visual acuity, optometry results,&#xD;
      intraocular pressure, lens eccentricity, capsule shrinkage, etc. after 1~2 days, 1 week, 1&#xD;
      month, 3 months, 6 months and 1 year or more after operation; The main safety indicators are&#xD;
      the incidence of complications, adverse events and serious adverse events during the&#xD;
      observation period, and adverse events and serious adverse events related to the validated&#xD;
      device.&#xD;
