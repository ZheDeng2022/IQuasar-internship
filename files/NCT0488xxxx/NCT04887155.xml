  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Although cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) has shown efficacy in reducing symptoms and rates&#xD;
      of mood relapse in adolescents at high risk for severe mood disorders (SMD; i.e., bipolar&#xD;
      I/II disorder and recurrent or unremitting major depression), a significant limitation to the&#xD;
      CBT's efficacy is the low rate of participant adherence to the prescribed between-session&#xD;
      homework tasks. Mobile health applications have the potential to improve adherence to and&#xD;
      acceptance of treatment through embedded treatment content, skill-practice, thought and&#xD;
      symptom monitoring, all of which are facilitated by reward contingencies and notifications.&#xD;
      This study examines whether a mobile application-enhanced CBT can improve participant&#xD;
      adherence and treatment acceptance for adolescents at high risk for SMD.&#xD;
