  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Establish a biorepository, clinical data registry, and radiographic image database from&#xD;
      individuals who were COVID positive at one time and are being seen for outpatient follow-up&#xD;
      or a separate study visit.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Living patients or their healthcare surrogates will provide informed consent prior to&#xD;
      participation in the biorepository. Surrogate decision makers who cannot consent in person&#xD;
      will be consented in accordance to the KUMC remote consent guidelines. Biospecimens to be&#xD;
      collected include serum, plasma and whole blood. Blood samples will be collected during&#xD;
      face-to-face encounters in the Post-COVID-19 clinic within the TUKHS pulmonary clinic or will&#xD;
      be coordinated with other outpatient follow-up appointments (including separate&#xD;
      procedure/lab-related visits) or separate study visits for ongoing, indepent studies. Samples&#xD;
      will be collected at time of consent as well as at potential follow-up visits at&#xD;
      approximately 3, 6, 12, and 12 months from enrollment. Blood samples will be processed,&#xD;
      aliquoted, and stored at -80°C. A portion of the blood samples will be kept for DNA and RNA&#xD;
      isolation, and a portion of plasma collected might be utilized to isolate peripheral blood&#xD;
      mononuclear cells. Biospecimens will be labeled with the patient's study ID number, date of&#xD;
      sample processing, and specimen type. Biospecimens will be stored through the duration of the&#xD;
      study. If the patient chooses to withdraw consent, his or her samples in the biorepository&#xD;
      will be destroyed. Biospecimens that have been previously used or disseminated will continue&#xD;
      to be utilized. Future research may include whole genome testing, and these results will not&#xD;
      be shared with the patient or their standard of care physician.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient data and historical radiographic imaging from after the date of consent will be&#xD;
      collected using TUKHS medical records and stored in RedCap. The data to be collected is&#xD;
      outlined in the data collection sheets.&#xD;
