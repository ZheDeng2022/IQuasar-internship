  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT) disease is the commonest sensitivo-motor inherited peripheral&#xD;
      neuropathies with a prevalence of about 10-30 per 100,000. To date, more than 80 genes have&#xD;
      been found responsible for CMT. Some of these genes code for mitochondrial proteins such as&#xD;
      mitofusin 2 (MFN2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the last few years, our laboratory has developed strong expertise in metabolomics. The&#xD;
      MetaDLM_CMT2A project proposes to produce metabolomic and lipidomic maps in CMT2A plasma from&#xD;
      a cohort of genetically and clinically characterized patients with a national recruitment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the perspective of future clinical trials, these biomarkers and the better understanding&#xD;
      of lipid metabolism defects in CMT2A would be of major interest in monitoring the evolution&#xD;
      of the disease and developing specific therapeutic approaches.&#xD;

    <description>We will compare the metabolomics and lipidomics of CMT2A patients compared to controls using high resolution mass spectrometry, by comparing the presence or not of the metabolites sought thanks to thetechnology developed by the company Biocrates (MxP-Quant-500 kit), allowing testing of 630 polar and lipid metabolites, under conditions close to medical biology.</description>
