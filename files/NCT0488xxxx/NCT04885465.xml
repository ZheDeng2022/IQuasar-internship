  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Caregivers of people with heart failure experience a lack of support from health care in&#xD;
      their caring role. They often want to become more involved in care, receive education and&#xD;
      have the opportunity to share experiences with other caregivers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives and hypothesis: Our hypothesis is that an internet-based support program that is&#xD;
      developed in collaboration with caregivers of people with heart failure will increase&#xD;
      preparedness to care (Preparedness for Caregiving Scale). We will also evaluate the effects&#xD;
      of the support program on the experiences of caring including positive experiences and the&#xD;
      impact of care on health and lifestyle (Caregiver Competence Scale, Rewards of Caregiving&#xD;
      Scale, Heart Failure-Caregiver Questionnaire) and their management of heart failure&#xD;
      (knowledge of heart failure, support for heart failure self-care and perceived control over&#xD;
      heart disease). We will also explore if the patients' healthcare consumption is altered when&#xD;
      caregivers receive more support.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Method: The project is a randomized controlled study where 300 caregivers from four health&#xD;
      care regions will be randomised to either receive a support program via 1177 care guide or to&#xD;
      a control group waiting list who receive standard support from health care and&#xD;
      municipalities. After the termination of the study participants in the control group will&#xD;
      also be offered access to the support program. Data will be collected with questionnaires at&#xD;
      baseline and after 3 and 6 months. A process evaluation with semi-structured interviews to&#xD;
      describe the relatives' experiences of using the program with be conducted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Relevance: Caregivers have been involved in all stages of the development of the&#xD;
      Internet-based support program. The evaluation focuses on both the effects of the&#xD;
      intervention and factors that affect implementation and equality. Caregiver support that is&#xD;
      delivered through 1177 care guide enables a more equal, efficient and accessible support for&#xD;
      caregivers.&#xD;
