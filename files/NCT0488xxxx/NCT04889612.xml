  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aimed to assess how stabilization of the trunk and the upper extremity can change&#xD;
      the parameters of hand/wrist motor coordination and grip strength in dominant and&#xD;
      non-dominant paretic upper limb, in post-stroke patients and neurologically healthy subjects.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The examination of the dominant and non-dominant paretic hand consisted of two motor tasks,&#xD;
      carried out in two different starting positions: sitting and lying down (supine).&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the first examination, the subject sat on the therapeutic table (without back&#xD;
      support), feet resting on the floor. The upper limb was examined in adduction of the humeral&#xD;
      joint, with the elbow bent in the intermediate position between pronation and supination of&#xD;
      the forearm, with free wrist and the hand.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the supine position, the affected upper limb was stabilized at the subject's body&#xD;
      (adduction in the humeral joint, elbow flexion in the intermediate position, wrist and hand&#xD;
      free). The Hand Tutor device and an electronic hand dynamometer were used for the&#xD;
      measurements. In each of the starting positions, after putting the glove on (using the Hand&#xD;
      Tutor Device), the subject was asked to make moves as quickly and in as full a range as&#xD;
      possible. Finally, the measurement of grip strength with a dynamometer was performed in both&#xD;
      analyzed starting positions, after completing the range of motion and frequency tests.&#xD;
