  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of pitolisant&#xD;
      compared with placebo in treating excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) in patients with&#xD;
      Myotonic Dystrophy Type 1 ages 18 to 65 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objectives of this study are to assess the impact of pitolisant on fatigue,&#xD;
      cognitive function and the burden of disease along with assessing the long-term safety and&#xD;
      effectiveness of pitolisant in patients with Myotonic Dystrophy Type 1 ages 18 to 65 years.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will consist of a Screening Period, an 11-week Double-Blind Treatment Phase&#xD;
      (including a 3-week Titration Period and an 8-week Stable Dose Period), and an optional Open&#xD;
      Label Extension (OLE) Phase. The OLE Phase will be multi-year in duration and will continue&#xD;
      until either pitolisant is approved for patients with Myotonic Dystrophy Type 1 or the&#xD;
      Sponsor elects to terminate the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Approximately 135 patients ages 18 to 65 years who meet all eligibility criteria will be&#xD;
      randomized at the Baseline Visit in a 1:1:1 ratio to low dose pitolisant, high dose&#xD;
      pitolisant, or matching placebo. In the Double-Blind Treatment Phase, patients will be&#xD;
      titrated to their randomized stable dose of study drug during the 3-week Titration Period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of the 3-week Titration Period, patients will continue to take study drug at&#xD;
      their randomized stable dose once daily in the morning upon wakening for an additional 8&#xD;
      weeks of blinded treatment (Stable Dose Period). The duration of the Double-Blind Treatment&#xD;
      Phase will be 11 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following the 11-week Double-Blind Treatment Phase, eligible patients will be given the&#xD;
      opportunity to participate in an optional OLE Phase. During the OLE Phase, all eligible&#xD;
      patients will receive treatment with open-label pitolisant and will undergo titration during&#xD;
      a 3-week Titration Period to a maximum target dose. At the end of the 3-week Titration&#xD;
      Period, patients will continue to take their dose of pitolisant once daily in the morning&#xD;
      upon wakening until the end of the study. The patient's dose of pitolisant may be adjusted&#xD;
      during the OLE phase.&#xD;
