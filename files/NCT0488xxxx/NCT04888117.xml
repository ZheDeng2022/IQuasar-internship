    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center cohort study, evaluating short-term clinical outcomes after complex&#xD;
      robotic-assisted and laparoscopic cholecystectomies. The primary outcomes include the rate of&#xD;
      conversion to open, rate of intra-operative adverse events, the rate of post-operative&#xD;
      adverse events relating to the cholecystectomy within 30 days, and re-admissions and&#xD;
      re-operations relating to the cholecystectomy within 30 days. In addition, operative time,&#xD;
      the rate of use of intra-operative imaging, the hospital length of stay, and pain and QOL&#xD;
      scores will be collected as secondary outcomes.&#xD;
