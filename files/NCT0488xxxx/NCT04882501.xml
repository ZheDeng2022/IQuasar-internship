  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Aromatherapy is the therapeutic use of essential oils from plants for the improvement of&#xD;
      physical, emotional, and spiritual well-being. Healthcare providers play an important role in&#xD;
      improving the care of patients with nausea. Aromatherapy is a complementary therapy that may&#xD;
      help with post-operative nausea in the adult post-operative bariatric patient population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effects of aromatherapy intervention on nausea&#xD;
      levels with post-operative bariatric patients once they are on the surgical unit.&#xD;

      Subjects will be provided with information about this research study by the following means:&#xD;
      a member of the research team- Inova Medical Group (IMG) Nurse Practitioners will discuss the&#xD;
      research study during the patient's second pre-operative visit; study information will be&#xD;
      uploaded to their MyChart portal; and flyers will be available in the IMG office (refer to&#xD;
      appendix A: IMG office flyer). Interested patients will be able to fill out a brief form&#xD;
      (refer to appendix B: Interested patient card) requesting to be contacted for further&#xD;
      information, this form will be placed in a secure box at the reception desk or the patients&#xD;
      can indicate interest by contacting one of the research team members. A member of the&#xD;
      research team may need to access medical record information in order to confirm potential&#xD;
      patient's phone number and or email address for further contact. A member of the research&#xD;
      team will contact any interested patients and answer any questions regarding the research&#xD;
      study. Consent will be obtained while the patient is in the peri-operative holding area on&#xD;
      day of surgery by a member of the research team, excluding the IMG Nurse Practitioners. The&#xD;
      research team member will determine if the patient is eligible for the study, discuss the&#xD;
      study, answer any questions, and obtain consent (refer to appendix C: Consent). All members&#xD;
      of the research team have completed Informed Consent Training. Once the consented&#xD;
      post-operative bariatric patient complains of initial nausea on the Surgical Unit, the direct&#xD;
      care nurse or research team member will ask the patient to rate their nausea level using a&#xD;
      VAS on a 0-3 scale. Patients will be provided with either product A or B based on&#xD;
      randomization scheme calculated by SAS (ver.9.4, Cary, NC). The patient will receive a&#xD;
      one-time aromatherapy intervention. Nausea levels will be reassessed 5 minutes after the&#xD;
      aromatherapy intervention. If the nausea level does not improve after the study drug&#xD;
      intervention an antiemetic medication will be offered (refer to appendix D: Data Collection&#xD;
      Form A).&#xD;
