  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Families of children receiving pediatric palliative care report unmet needs that require&#xD;
      support. The objective of this pilot study is to develop and evaluate a psychological&#xD;
      intervention (SOFUS) that targets the whole family (i.e. parents, the ill child and siblings)&#xD;
      before and after bereavement. The aim of the intervention is to improve coping skills and&#xD;
      reduce symptoms of complicated grief, depression, anxiety and sleep disorders in families.&#xD;
      Feasibility and acceptability of the intervention manual and study materials will be&#xD;
      evaluated, and the preliminary efficacy of the intervention will be assessed.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Having a child in palliative care is a traumatic experience and families of children&#xD;
      receiving pediatric palliative care report unmet needs that require support. Parents who&#xD;
      experience the death of a child often experience severe grief reactions, which may develop&#xD;
      into long-term impaired functioning or psychiatric illness, with a detrimental impact on the&#xD;
      whole family. Furthermore, parents and siblings of a child in palliative care may already&#xD;
      prior to death experience grief and loss. This indicates the need for a family-based&#xD;
      intervention that can support the family before and after the death of a child.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SOFUS is a psychological intervention for families of children receiving pediatric palliative&#xD;
      care team. The preliminary/pilot program has been manualized and consists of a pre-loss&#xD;
      program (Program 1) and a post-loss program (Program 2) consisting of six sessions each&#xD;
      designed for the whole family. Sessions 1 and 6 includes the whole family, sessions 2 and 3&#xD;
      focus on the parents, while sessions 4 and 5 target the children (with parents if the child&#xD;
      is under 10 years old). The six sessions range from 1 to 1.5 hours in length and are to be&#xD;
      delivered over a 3 month period. The intervention will be carried out by trained&#xD;
      psychologists. Feasibility and fidelity will assessed by evaluation forms filled out by the&#xD;
      therapist after each session.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of the intervention, semi-structured interviews will be carried out with each&#xD;
      family to evaluate the components of the intervention, participant materials and assess&#xD;
      acceptability. A semi-structured interview will also be carried out with the psychologists to&#xD;
      evaluate the components of the intervention, the intervention manual and to assess therapist&#xD;
      acceptability of the intervention. This pilot study will also include questionnaires for the&#xD;
      parents assessing the outcomes of coping, anxiety, depression, sleep quality, family&#xD;
      functioning and family caregiving burden at baseline, 3, 6 and 12 months. Age-adapted&#xD;
      questionnaires will be given to the children to assess a subset of the outcomes.&#xD;

    <description>The SOFUS pilot program consists of six pre-loss sessions (Program 1) and a further six post-loss sessions (Program 2), which are delivered over a 3-month period. Each session ranges from 1-1.5 hours. Sessions 1 and 6 includes the whole family, sessions 2 and 3 focus on the parents, while sessions 4 and 5 target the children (with parents if the child is &lt;10 years old).&#xD;
SOFUS consists of three primary components: i) strengthening COMMUNICATION between parents and children, ii) NORMALIZATION of grief processes (pre and post-lost), and iii) EMOTION REGULATION strategies targeting motivational awareness and regulatory skills in grief management (pre and post-lost).&#xD;
Families in Program 1 may be offered Program 2 if the child dies before the entire program has been delivered.</description>
