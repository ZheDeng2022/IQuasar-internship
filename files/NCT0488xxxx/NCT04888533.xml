      E.H.S.S.A. - a suicide assessment tool that was empirically designed by an emergency&#xD;
      psychiatry department (P.E.S.P. of Bergen County) in its effort to accurately predict, in&#xD;
      specific patients, the risk of suicide attempts in the reasonably foreseeable future. It is&#xD;
      of a unique paradigm that combines critical elements of holism, heuristics and&#xD;
      semi-structured design.&#xD;

      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Many studies have found that insight regarding suicide risk-factors for cohorts does not&#xD;
      translate to practical value in the identification of such risk in specific individuals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This performance improvement study formally examined the effectiveness of &quot;EHSSA&quot; (efficient,&#xD;
      holistic/heuristic semi-structured suicide-risk assessment) - an empirically derived tool&#xD;
      designed by this emergency psychiatry department. It is a suicide assessment tool for&#xD;
      predicting in a specific patient (as opposed to a cohort), the risk of serious suicide&#xD;
      attempts in the reasonably foreseeable future.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      At P.E.S.P. (Psychiatric Emergency Screening Program) of Bergen County of New Jersey, a&#xD;
      prospective performance improvement study was done on all patients (N = 1,505) that had&#xD;
      presented with psychiatric crisis to the department over the course of a 6 month period, (of&#xD;
      which approximately 50% had significant suicidal ideations). The only exclusionary criteria&#xD;
      was active delirium.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each patient was evaluated using &quot;EHSSA&quot; by departmentally trained mental health&#xD;
      professionals. Patients were deemed to either require hospitalization or be safe to be&#xD;
      discharged to the community (with appropriate outpatient referrals). Those that were&#xD;
      discharged (N = 137) were followed up with phone calls approximately 15 days post discharge.&#xD;
