  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main aims of the study are to assess the safety profile of teduglutide (Revestive®) as&#xD;
      well as how many people with Short Bowl Syndrome experience a reduction of parenteral support&#xD;
      when treated with teduglutide (Revestive®).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is about collecting existing data only; participants will not receive teduglutide&#xD;
      (Revestive®) as part of this study. No new information will be collected during this study.&#xD;
      Only data already available in the hospital records will be reviewed and collected for this&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants do not need to visit their doctor in addition to their normal visits.&#xD;
