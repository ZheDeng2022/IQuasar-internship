  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators propose a longitudinal home study of ALS patients to measure the severity&#xD;
      of speech and swallowing (bulbar) impairment via a smartphone-based, remote speech and&#xD;
      swallow assessment (rSSA). The study is designed to assess the feasibility and validity of&#xD;
      such a monitoring intervention. Furthermore, it is proposed that regular monitoring of these&#xD;
      two bulbar processes may shed light on their co-evolution over the course of ALS.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Most individuals with ALS experience bulbar function deterioration over the course of the&#xD;
      disease which impacts their quality of life significantly. Furthermore, in some patients,&#xD;
      bulbar symptoms are an initial presenting symptom of ALS. Identifying these changes, which&#xD;
      may be rapid in some individuals, is complicated by the recent acceleration of virtual care&#xD;
      delivery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators propose a longitudinal home study of ALS patients to assess bulbar&#xD;
      progression via a smartphone-based, self-administered remote speech and swallow assessment&#xD;
      (rSSA). The overall hypothesis is that this monitoring protocol can be used in a way that, 1)&#xD;
      is satisfactory to the patient, 2) performs at least as well as standard clinical measures of&#xD;
      dysarthria and dysphagia, and 3) resolves the development of emergence of speech and&#xD;
      swallowing pathologies in ALS.&#xD;
