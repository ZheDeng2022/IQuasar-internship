  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It was observed that premature babies had the risk of insufficient milk intake and a lower&#xD;
      rate of breastfeeding compared to term babies. Various problems may occur at home, especially&#xD;
      after breastfeeding training in the hospital. After discharge, support and counseling should&#xD;
      be provided to eliminate problems that may stop breastfeeding or to prevent events that may&#xD;
      prevent breastfeeding. The aim of this study is to examine the effect of &quot;Telephone&#xD;
      Breastfeeding Support&quot; given to mothers of premature babies discharged from the neonatal&#xD;
      intensive care unit on breastfeeding results.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study was planned as a randomized, parallel two-group, controlled experimental design.&#xD;
      This research will be conducted between June 2021 and June 2022 with premature baby mothers.&#xD;
      The sample of the study will be mothers (n = 62) of premature babies discharged from Antalya&#xD;
      Training and Research Hospital Neonatal Intensive Care Unit. The discharge routine procedures&#xD;
      of all mothers participating in the study will be completed and a breastfeeding guide&#xD;
      prepared for premature babies will be sent to the phone. On the 3rd day after discharge, a&#xD;
      reminder message will be sent to support the mother in the intervention group (n = 31) and to&#xD;
      encourage breast milk. Throughout the program, 21 messages will be sent to the mothers in the&#xD;
      first month after discharge, via the messaging application (whatsapp, bip, telegram, etc.) In&#xD;
      addition, seven phone calls will be made once a week in the first month after discharge, and&#xD;
      once a month in the eighth, twelfth and sixteenth weeks. Data will be collected by&#xD;
      Mother-Baby Introductory Information Form, Breastfeeding Self-Efficacy Scale (short form)&#xD;
      (BSES), Infant Feeding Attitude Scale (IIFAS) and Breastfeeding Time Assessment Form. The&#xD;
      pre-test will be taken with the Mother-Baby Descriptive Information Form, BSES and IIFAS&#xD;
      during the discharge routine procedures, and the post-test will be taken with the BSES, IIFAS&#xD;
      and Breastfeeding Time Assessment Form when the baby is six months old. Ethics Committee and&#xD;
      Institutional Permission was obtained for the study. In addition, written consent will be&#xD;
      obtained from the participants. Statistical analysis will be done using SPSS 23.0 and&#xD;
      significance will be evaluated at p &lt;0.05. Support will be received in the analysis phase of&#xD;
      the Statistical Information Unit of Akdeniz University. It is anticipated that new&#xD;
      information from research data will improve breastfeeding results of premature babies and&#xD;
      guide new research.&#xD;

    <description>The scale, which is valid and reliable in our country by AlusÌ§ Tokat, Okun and Dennis (2010), consists of 14 items and is a Likert type scale rated between 1 and 5. The minimum score that can be retrieved from the scale is 14 and the maximum is 70. As the score rises, high breastfeeding is an indicator of self-sufficiency.</description>

    <measure>Infant Feeding Attitude Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>0-6 months (During discharge routine procedures and when the baby is six months old)</time_frame>
    <description>The scale was developed to evaluate women's attitudes towards breastfeeding and to predict breastfeeding duration as well as the choice of baby feeding method. The scale consists of 5-point Likert type and 17 items. The total attitude score ranges from 17 (showing a positive attitude to bottle feeding) to 85 (reflecting a positive attitude towards breastfeeding). The higher the score on the scale, the higher it indicates the higher breastfeeding attitude.</description>
