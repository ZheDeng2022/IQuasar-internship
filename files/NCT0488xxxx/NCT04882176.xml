      This is a phase I/II, open-label, dose escalation and dose extension study to evaluate the&#xD;
      safety, tolerability, PK, and preliminary efficacy of LM-061 in subjects with advanced&#xD;
      tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study schedule includes screening visit (28 days prior to accept the investigational&#xD;
      medicinal product (IMP)), treatment visit (accept IMP for the first time to the end of&#xD;
      treatment (EOT)/early withdrawal), and follow-up visit (28 days after the EOT/early&#xD;
      withdrawal).&#xD;
