  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The COgnitive and Physical Exercise to improve Outcomes after Surgery (COPE-iOS) study is&#xD;
      testing the hypothesis that a pragmatic program combining computerized cognitive training and&#xD;
      physical training throughout the perioperative period will improve long-term cognitive and&#xD;
      disability outcomes in older surgical patients at high risk for decline. To accomplish these&#xD;
      goals, the Investigators are randomizing 250 patients ≥60 years old undergoing elective major&#xD;
      non-cardiac surgery with expected hospitalization ≥3 days to a pragmatic comprehensive&#xD;
      training program (computerized cognitive training and supervised progressive physical&#xD;
      exercise) or to active control (control computer game, stretching exercises) for 2-4 weeks&#xD;
      prior to surgery and for 3 months after discharge. At baseline and after discharge, the&#xD;
      Investigators will assess global cognition, activities of daily living, depression,&#xD;
      endothelial and blood brain barrier function (blood biomarkers), and neuroimaging (anatomical&#xD;
      and functional MRI). In this early stage trial, the Investigators will determine if certain&#xD;
      subgroups benefit most, program aspects with greatest effect on outcomes, mechanistic&#xD;
      associations with outcomes, and additional exploratory analyses.&#xD;

&#xD;
          5. Inability to obtain informed consent ≥2 weeks before scheduled surgery&#xD;
