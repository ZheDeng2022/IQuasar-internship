  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pediatric blood cancer is the most common childhood malignancy. Despite its survival has been&#xD;
      substantially improved, children still have to pay a high price for numerous distressing&#xD;
      symptoms resulted from chemotherapy. Previous studies related to symptom experiences mainly&#xD;
      focus on individual symptoms, rather than on multiple symptoms. Understanding these&#xD;
      distressing symptoms may help healthcare professionals to develop appropriate and effective&#xD;
      interventions with the aims of alleviating symptom severity and thus promoting the child's&#xD;
      psychosocial well-being and quality of life.&#xD;

      A longitudinal study design will be conducted. A sample of 120 patients age 5-17years,&#xD;
      diagnosed with blood cancer but not yet receive any chemotherapy and able to communicate with&#xD;
      Cantonese and read Chinese will be recruited in the pediatric oncology ward of Hong Kong&#xD;
      Children's Hospital.&#xD;
