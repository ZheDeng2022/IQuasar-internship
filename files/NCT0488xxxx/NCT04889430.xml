  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this Phase 3 study is to determine whether iptacopan (LNP023) is efficacious&#xD;
      and safe for the treatment of aHUS in adult patients who are treatment naive to complement&#xD;
      inhibitor therapy.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is designed as a multicenter, single-arm, open label study to demonstrate the&#xD;
      efficacy and safety of LNP023 (iptacopan) at a dose of 200 mg b.i.d. in adult patients with&#xD;
      aHUS who are treatment naive to complement inhibitor therapy (including anti-C5 antibody).&#xD;
      The study will enroll approximately 50 participants and assess the effects of iptacopan on a&#xD;
      range of efficacy assessments relevant to aHUS including hematological and kidney parameters,&#xD;
      dialysis requirement, changes in chronic kidney disease (CKD) stage, as well as patient&#xD;
      reported outcomes (PRO) for fatigue and quality of life.&#xD;

             infections) caused by encapsulated bacteria&#xD;
