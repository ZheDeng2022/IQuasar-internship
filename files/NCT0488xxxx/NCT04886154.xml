  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the safety, effectiveness and immune response of the&#xD;
      meningococcal combined ABCWY vaccine (GSK4023393A) intended to protect against invasive&#xD;
      meningococcal disease (IMD) caused by all 5 meningococcal serogroups. The first time-in-human&#xD;
      (FTIH), Phase I part of this study will be conducted in healthy adults in a dose-escalating&#xD;
      fashion with 2 formulations of the investigational MenABCWY-2Gen vaccine and will serve as a&#xD;
      safety lead-in to the Phase II study. The Phase II part of the study will be conducted in 2&#xD;
      parts: The 'formulation and schedule-finding' part will follow in healthy adolescents and&#xD;
      young adults and it is designed to select the vaccine formulation and the schedule to be&#xD;
      tested in Phase III. The 'blood sourcing' part will be conducted in healthy adults in order&#xD;
      to collect sufficient serum samples for the development of assays to be used in the&#xD;
      MenABCWY-2Gen vaccine clinical development program.&#xD;
