      This study is the determination of the Turkish version of the Peabody Developmental Motor&#xD;
      Scale-2 and its Turkish validity reliability in infants age between 0 - 24 months and to&#xD;
      spread its use for evaluation in early rehabilitation in our country.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>

      There are developments in the field of diagnosing children with a high risk of developmental&#xD;
      disorders such as cerebral palsy (CP), mental problems and autism spectrum disorder in&#xD;
      infancy . In particular, in infants experiencing the onset of extrauterine life in the&#xD;
      neonatal intensive care unit, the combination of neonatal neuroimaging along with the&#xD;
      assessment of general movements results in a highly accurate prediction of CP .A clinical&#xD;
      tool often used in predictions is a neurological examination. Various standard variants are&#xD;
      available, such as the Hammersmith Infant Neurological Examination (HINE), Alberta Infant&#xD;
      Motor Scale (AIMS). PGMS-2 was developed by Folio and Fewell (2000) to determine the gross&#xD;
      and fine motor development levels of children from birth to 71 months. The scale can be used&#xD;
      for both children with healthy development and children with special needs. In the&#xD;
      development of the Peabody Developmental Motor Scale (PGMS), which is the original version of&#xD;
      PGMS-2 used in this study, a developmental structure was adopted instead of sticking to a&#xD;
      certain theoretical perspective. PGMS is the first nationally standardized assessment tool&#xD;
      that gives gross and fine motor scores separately in the United States of America (USA).This&#xD;
      study is the determination of the Turkish version of the Peabody Developmental Motor Scale-2&#xD;
      and its Turkish validity reliability in infants age between 0 - 24 months and to spread its&#xD;
      use for evaluation in early rehabilitation in our country.&#xD;

    <measure>Peabody Developmental Motor Scale II (PDMS-2)</measure>
    <time_frame>45-60 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>is composed of six subtests (reflex, stationary, locomotion, object manipulation, grasping, and visual-motor integration) that measure inter-related abilities in early motor development. It was designed to assess gross and fine motor skills in children from birth through 5 years of age.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The Alberta Infant Motor Scale (AIMS)</measure>
    <time_frame>30-40 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>The AIMS is a norm-referenced observational scale that enables the determination of infants with delay or deviation in motor development and to evaluate the changes in motor development over time. It is used to follow the movement patterns of infants who show atypical movement patterns over time. Average application time is 30-40 minutes. 0-18. The evaluation is made on a total of 58 items in 4 different developmental positions: supine, prone, sitting and standing between months.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Hammersmith Infant Neurological Examination (HINE)</measure>
    <time_frame>30-45 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>The HINE includes three sections, the Neurological Examination, the Development of Motor Functions and the State of Behaviour. The first section evaluates cranial nerve, posture, movements, tone and reflexes. These items are not age-dependent. The second section evaluates head control, sitting, voluntary grasping, rolling, crawling and walking. The third section evaluates state of consciousness, emotional state and social orientation.</description>
