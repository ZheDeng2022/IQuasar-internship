    <textblock>
      Suicide cognitions are conceptualized as enduring, chronic vulnerability factors that&#xD;
      predispose individuals to suicidal crises. Therefore, modification of these beliefs may&#xD;
      reduce suicidal thoughts and behaviors. The goal of this research is to develop, refine, and&#xD;
      pilot-test a mobile intervention to reduce cognitions that contribute to elevated suicide&#xD;
      risk and to assess the impact of reductions in suicide cognitions and anger cognitions on&#xD;
      suicide risk and functioning.&#xD;

      Suicide cognitions are conceptualized as enduring, chronic vulnerability factors that&#xD;
      predispose individuals to suicidal crises. Therefore, modification of these beliefs may&#xD;
      reduce suicidal thoughts and behaviors. In addition to suicide cognitions, another&#xD;
      potentially modifiable risk factor for suicide is anger. The goal of this research is to&#xD;
      develop, refine, and pilot-test a mobile interpretation bias modification intervention to&#xD;
      reduce cognitions that contribute to elevated suicide risk and to assess the impact of&#xD;
      reductions in suicide cognitions and hostile interpretation bias (a cognitive bias that is&#xD;
      associated with anger) on suicide risk and functioning.&#xD;

    <description>These are both mobile interventions that use interpretation bias modification (IBM) techniques to reduce cognitive biases. The MIST app targets suicidal cognitions and the MIRA app targets hostile interpretation bias (which contributes to anger). The MIRA application has already been developed, but the MIST application is newly developed based on the same procedures. All participants will complete the MIST intervention and provide feedback so that we can refine it. We will also be collecting EMA data on to examine how changes to suicide cognitions and hostile interpretation bias (by use of the two apps) affects suicidal ideation and functioning.</description>
