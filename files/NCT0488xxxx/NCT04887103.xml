    <textblock>
      Backgraund and Purpose: The prevalance of restless legs syndrome (RLS) in pregnants varies&#xD;
      between 15.4-26.0 percent. As well as pharmacological methods, there are studies reporting&#xD;
      that non-pharmacological methods reduce RLS symptoms but the number of studies conducted with&#xD;
      pregnants is limited. This study was conducted to determine the effect of hot water&#xD;
      application to the legs of pregnants with RLS on their complaints.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Materials and methods: The study is a pretest-posttest randomised controlled. Among the&#xD;
      pregnants whose IRLS score was more than 11, 13 people to the intervention group and 16&#xD;
      people to the control group were randomised. The data were collected using Personal&#xD;
      Information Form, International RLS Study Group Diagnostic Criteria, and the International&#xD;
      RLS Rating Scale (IRLS). Hot water application was made of intervention group. The&#xD;
      application was made for 20 minutes before bedtime for seven days. No application was made in&#xD;
      the control group other than routine care and follow-up. Chi-square test, descriptive&#xD;
      statistics and dependent/independent samples t tests were used to assess the data. The value&#xD;
      of p&lt;0.05 was accepted as significant.&#xD;

    <description>The RLS Severity Rating Scale was developed in 2003 by the International Restless Legs Syndrome Study Group. The scale was applied in the selection of patients and in the weekly evaluation of RLS severity. The scale comprised ten questions; each question was scored between 0 and 4. Questions 1, 2, 4, 6, 7, and 8 were related to RLS symptoms, questions 5, 9, and 10 were related to the effect of the disease on the mental state and daily social activities of patients with RLS, and question 3 was about the diagnostic criteria of RLS. The overall score indicated the RLS severity. A minimum score of 0 and a maximum score of 40 could be obtained. A score between 1 and 10 corresponded to &quot;mild,&quot; 11-20 &quot;moderate,&quot; 21-30 &quot;severe,&quot; and 31-40 &quot;very severe&quot; RLS.</description>
