  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Physical activity (PA) is insufficient in children with three quarters of them who do not&#xD;
      meet the WHO's recommendations. Physical inactivity is growing during adolescence; in part&#xD;
      due to the time spend in sedentary behaviors at school. The recent literature is highlighting&#xD;
      the importance of physical activity on academic achievement, physical fitness and academic&#xD;
      achievement in children. In addition, deleterious effects of sedentary behaviors have been&#xD;
      demonstrated. At school, many strategies have been settled to break the prolonged sitting&#xD;
      time. The use of workstations is one of them and allows to reduce sedentary time at school&#xD;
      and increases physical activity without interrupting class. Active workstations like bike&#xD;
      desks have demonstrated their effectiveness on physical activity but their effects have not&#xD;
      been evaluated in primary school in France. In addition, few studies have evaluated the&#xD;
      effects of bike desk use on the child's cognitive abilities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective of this project is to measure the variations linked to the use of bike&#xD;
      desks (desk with pedals) for an average of 1h45mn per week (30min 3 to 4 times per week) for&#xD;
      13 weeks during school time in primary school pupils (aged 8 to 11 years) on the cognitive&#xD;
      abilities (mental flexibility, working memory and inhibition) of children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our hypothesis is that the use of the bike desk for 1h45 per week will induce an increase in&#xD;
      the attention and cognitive capacities (mental flexibility, working memory and inhibition) of&#xD;
      the children. Other improvements that should be identified are the child's body composition,&#xD;
      the classroom climate and the well-being of pupils and teachers. The children's physical&#xD;
      capacities could also be increased, beyond what is expected given the normal evolution during&#xD;
      the year.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Two prospective schools have given their prior agreement : Sevigne Lafaye (Vichy) and Pierre&#xD;
      Brossolette (Riom). The use of the bike desks in the classroom is part of the school project&#xD;
      and will start at the same time as the study. There are 4 bike-desks in each class: 3 for the&#xD;
      children and 1 for the teacher. Students pedaling during an overall of 13 weeks (7 weeks and&#xD;
      6 weeks) separated of one evaluation session week (T1). During weeks with evaluation&#xD;
      sessions, children will not use bike desk. All children will therefore use the bike desks but&#xD;
      only those who have signed the consent form.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An information meeting will be proposed in each school (visit 1). Then, subjects will have a&#xD;
      pre-inclusion visit during a medical consultation where the eligibility criteria to&#xD;
      participate in this study will be checked (visit 2). The children who have given their&#xD;
      consent will have to participate in different evaluation sessions: baseline (T0), between to&#xD;
      two pedaling sessions (T1) and at the end of the second session (T2). They are two parts of&#xD;
      assessments for each session (T0, T1, T2):&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cognitive test and the physical activity attraction test (visits 3, 5, 7)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Body composition and physical capacity assessment (visits 4, 6, 8) Questionnaires will&#xD;
           also be part of the assessment (T1 and T2).&#xD;
