  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study, ambulatory wearables and smartphone-based measures will be used to monitor&#xD;
      free-living sleep, activity, behavioural data collection, as well as ambulant glucose&#xD;
      monitoring to characterise normal behaviour profiles in association with physiological and&#xD;
      metabolic rhythms in a cohort of healthy young Chinese university students during the normal&#xD;
      school term.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary aim of this proposed study is to obtain longitudinal information about the range&#xD;
      of normal sleep, activity and meal schedules and metabolic rhythms among young healthy&#xD;
      Chinese university students within a free-living setting. Monitoring free-living glucose&#xD;
      rhythms, sleep and meal schedules while controlling dietary intake may enable the provision&#xD;
      of a useful characterisation of the range of normal sleep, meal and activity schedules and&#xD;
      glucose rhythmicity in healthy populations to contribute to the identification of phenotypes&#xD;
      at greater risk of metabolic disease. The secondary aim of this study relating to metabolism&#xD;
      is to identify associations between glucose rhythms, health outcomes, and meal timings in&#xD;
      relation to circadian phase from sleep-wake patterns.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In terms of sleep monitoring, the primary goal is to validate passive WiFi sensing against&#xD;
      measurement of sleep using a commercial sleep and activity tracker (Oura ring), smartphone&#xD;
      touchscreen interactions (tappigraphy-based sleep estimation) and sleep diary logs in&#xD;
      students who are residing in dormitories. Studying this sample affords a convenient, and&#xD;
      privacy protecting way of obtaining WiFi data. This can contribute to establishing whether a&#xD;
      combination of multiple data sources for sleep detection can improve accuracy of sleep&#xD;
      detection,incorporating the influence of device usage in the peri-sleep period. The secondary&#xD;
      goal of this sleep study is the triangulation of sleep detection techniques for long term&#xD;
      sleep monitoring on university campus. The hope is to access a larger population of students&#xD;
      to infer sleep behaviours and sleep health, and eventually, to develop interventions to&#xD;
      improve population health using individualised sleep data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Moreover, these data can also enable the identification of changes in sleep patterns&#xD;
      associated with closer proximity to school examination dates, when students are expected to&#xD;
      experience increases in academic workloads and greater amounts of stress. Delays and more&#xD;
      irregularities in sleep timings, and shorter sleep durations closer to exam dates are&#xD;
      expected to be observed, and these are expected to affect higher glycemic variability and&#xD;
      higher average glucose values in accord with the extent of sleep pattern alteration.&#xD;
