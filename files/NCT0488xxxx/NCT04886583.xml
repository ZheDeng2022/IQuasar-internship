  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      During a polysomnography test (PSG) previously prescribed by a physician, the patient also&#xD;
      wears the Gaby Baby Band (GBB) during an entire night of sleep. After the test, data from the&#xD;
      device and from the PSG (HR, SpO2, BR) will be saved and analysed in the aim to assess the&#xD;
      actual accuracy of the GBB with golden standard values (ECG, Oximeter, belly belt). In a&#xD;
      second analysis, the aim is to improve the accuracy of the GBB algorithm.&#xD;
