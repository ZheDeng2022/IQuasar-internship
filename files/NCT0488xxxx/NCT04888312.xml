      OPTIMIZE-1 is a phase 1b/2, open-label, multi-center study assessing the clinical efficacy of&#xD;
      mitazalimab in combination with chemotherapy in patients with metastatic pancreatic ductal&#xD;
      adenocarcinoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The efficacy of intravenously administered mitazalimab in combination with the standard of&#xD;
      care chemotherapy mFOLFIRINOX will be evaluated in patients with metastatic pancreatic ductal&#xD;
      adenocarcinoma. Two dose levels of mitazalimab, 450 ug/kg and 900 ug/kg, are planned to be&#xD;
      evaluated together with mFOLFIRINOX for determination of recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of&#xD;
      mitazalimab in combination with mFOLFIRINOX before entering a dose expansion part with RP2D&#xD;
      obtained. The expansion part will evaluate the clinical efficacy of mitazalimab in&#xD;
      combination with mFOLFIRINOX assessing objective response rate (ORR), primary endpoint, as&#xD;
      well as Progression-free survival (PFS) and Overall survival (OS). The dose expansion part&#xD;
      includes a Simon´s two-stage design with an interim analysis for stop for futility or&#xD;
      efficacy based on ORR.&#xD;
