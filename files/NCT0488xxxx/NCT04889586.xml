  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Recovery of upper limb and hand gestures is fundamental for autonomy restoration after&#xD;
      stroke. Innovative technologies are a valid support for the delivery of rehabilitation&#xD;
      treatments. Embedding surface electromyographic (sEMG) into wearable devices, allows the&#xD;
      customisation of rehabilitation exercises, based on the clinical profile of each patient.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The aims of this study are to determine safety and feasibility of a prototype EMG-control&#xD;
      wearable device (REMO) and to individualise clinical features of stroke survivors able to&#xD;
      control the EMG armband targeted to hand rehabilitation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The device REMO consists in an armband composed by 8 bipolar electrodes able to record and&#xD;
      process the electromyography of forearm muscles. The patterns of muscle activations are&#xD;
      classified and used to perform EMG-biofeedback exercises in stroke rehabilitation training.&#xD;
      The device is developed by clinicians of IRCCS San Camillo Hospital and spin-off&#xD;
      Morecognition Srl.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 100 stroke patients patients has been recruited. They are clinically assessed and&#xD;
      then tested on the ability to control the sEMG wearable device. The test is composed of 10&#xD;
      hand and fingers gestures to be performed with the paretic hand. Baseline and activation sEMG&#xD;
      signals are recorded and compared for each movement. Three conditions representing absent,&#xD;
      partial or full control of the device are defined and logistic multivarialbes regression&#xD;
      models are used to identify clinical features describing the group each patient belongs to.&#xD;
      Clinical cut-off for each strata is identified by odds ratio.&#xD;

    <measure>Reaching Performance Scale (RPS)</measure>
    <time_frame>within 1 week from enrolment.</time_frame>
    <description>RPS assesses the ability of subjects to reach an object (a cone). The cone is placed at both 4-cm (close) and 30-cm (far) distance from the subject. The subject is asked to reach and grab the cone if possible. The observer evaluates the quality of reaching instead of the grip strength (Total score = 36 points).</description>

    <description>NHPT measures the dexterity of the hand. Patient should insert 9 pins in the board. There are 9 pins. The number of pins inserted in 50 sec are registered or if the patient inserted 9 pins, then the time is registered.</description>
