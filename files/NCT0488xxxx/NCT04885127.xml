  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      AML is the most common leukemia diagnosed in adults. In spite of recent low-intensity&#xD;
      therapies that have improved outcomes for older AML patients, AML remains associated with&#xD;
      poor prognosis as well as high symptom burden. While the benefits of early palliative care as&#xD;
      well as electronic PROs have been well-described in the oncology population, neither have&#xD;
      been well-studied in the AML population, and have never been studied in combination. We&#xD;
      propose a prospective, single-center, single-arm trial to evaluate the feasibility of a&#xD;
      virtually-mediated supportive care model utilizing both electronic PROs and palliative care&#xD;
      for patients with AML being treated with low-intensity therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AIM1: is to evaluate and describe the feasibility of implementing early specialty palliative&#xD;
      care referrals carried out via telehealth/video-based modalities in combination with digital&#xD;
      symptom monitoring for patients recently diagnosed with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and&#xD;
      starting low intensity induction therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AIM2: study the differences in health-related quality-of-life (HRQoL) metrics using&#xD;
      patient-reported outcomes (PROs) in patients recently diagnosed with AML and starting low&#xD;
      intensity induction therapy who receive early referral to telehealth/video-based palliative&#xD;
      care visits compared to standard care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AIM3: to explore the patient experience of patients with AML on low-intensity therapy,&#xD;
      capture rates of advance care planning, hospice utilization, and hospital utilization.&#xD;
