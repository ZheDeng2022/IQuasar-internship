  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The COVID-19 pandemic and continued lockdown measures have led to social isolation that is&#xD;
      likely disproportionately affecting community-dwelling seniors. This social isolation of&#xD;
      seniors is expected to cause detrimental health effects especially in those who have an&#xD;
      ongoing or new onset late life depressive episode. The COVID-19 pandemic has also made&#xD;
      accessing formal psychotherapy services increasingly difficult due to an increased demand for&#xD;
      these services and a limited number of trained professionals available to deliver these&#xD;
      interventions. We plan to conduct an open label, pilot, randomized controlled trial (RCT),&#xD;
      comparing a virtually delivered (telephone) student led mental health supportive initiative,&#xD;
      Student Senior Isolation Prevention Partnership (SSIPP) (n=15) compared to a telephone&#xD;
      delivered standard psychotherapy intervention, problem-solving therapy (PST) (n=15) versus a&#xD;
      wait list control (n=15) in community-dwelling seniors suffering from late life depression.&#xD;
      Participants in this study will be blinded to the hypothesis, while those performing data&#xD;
      analysis will be blinded to treatment allocation. Both SSIPP and PST will be delivered via&#xD;
      telephone as a weekly session for 12-weeks. Feasibility measures of recruitment, retention&#xD;
      and costs will be collected as primary outcome measures. Self-rated measures of depression,&#xD;
      anxiety, isolation and resilience will comprise secondary exploratory outcomes. We anticipate&#xD;
      that it will be feasible to conduct an RCT of these telephone interventions, SSIPP and PST,&#xD;
      in socially isolated community-dwelling seniors. Data from this study will be critical to&#xD;
      plan a subsequent confirmatory large-scale RCT. It could be that telephone delivered medical&#xD;
      student led supportive intervention, SSIPP and/or a telephone delivered psychotherapy&#xD;
      initiative, PST, can be feasibly applied in the current pandemic to a high-risk population,&#xD;
      isolated seniors suffering from depression.&#xD;

      BACKGROUND&#xD;
&#xD;
      The rapid spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus&#xD;
      responsible for the current coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak, has led to strict&#xD;
      social distancing and social isolation recommendations from the World Health Organization&#xD;
      (1). As the elderly are most susceptible to critical illness and fatality due to infection&#xD;
      with SARS-CoV-2, they have also been subjected to the most stringent social isolation&#xD;
      guidelines in Canada as an attempt to prevent death in this population (1,2). While these&#xD;
      public health measures are necessary to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV-2 among our vulnerable&#xD;
      geriatric populations and to protect our over-burdened healthcare systems, social isolation&#xD;
      has had a detrimental impact on the mental health of this population and has been deemed a&#xD;
      mental health crisis (1,3).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to assess the feasibility of delivering SSIPP in London, Canada, as&#xD;
      compared to an active control, PST, as well as a wait list control. Such a study would also&#xD;
      allow to collect effect size estimates on the efficacy of SSIPP on self-rated depression,&#xD;
      anxiety, isolation and resilience among community-dwelling seniors. As SSIPP is more&#xD;
      accessible and more readily available than PST, we aim to determine if SSIPP is as effective&#xD;
      as the structured psychotherapy intervention PST at achieving these outcomes. Data from this&#xD;
      study will help inform the design of a future large, multi-center RCT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OBJECTIVES&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective 1: To determine if it is feasible to conduct an RCT of telephone SSIPP in&#xD;
      comparison to PST delivered to community-dwelling seniors during the current constraints&#xD;
      imposed by COVID-19 and the need for telephone delivery of these services.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective 2: To determine the extent of change in self-rated depression, anxiety, isolation&#xD;
      and resilience measures in a telephone delivered SSIPP as compared to telephone delivered PST&#xD;
      and wait list control among community dwelling seniors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HYPOTHESES&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 1: It will be feasible to conduct an RCT of telephone SSIPP in comparison to&#xD;
      telephone PST and a wait list control, under the current constraints imposed by COVID-19 and&#xD;
      the need for telephone delivery of these services.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 2: It will be possible to collect effect size estimates of SSIPP compared to PST&#xD;
      and a wait list control on symptoms of depression, anxiety, isolation and resilience in&#xD;
      community dwelling seniors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY DESIGN&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will be open label, randomized, controlled trial comparing 12-week telephone&#xD;
      delivered SSIPP and PST in a total of 45 participants, randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to one of&#xD;
      three groups. The three study groups that participants could be randomized to, include SSIPP,&#xD;
      PST, or a waitlist control (WLC). The WLC participants will self-select participation in&#xD;
      either SSIPP or PST at the end of the 12-week waiting period. They will not complete study&#xD;
      assessments following week 12. This study will plan to enroll n=45 with 15 participants&#xD;
      randomized to each of the three groups. Participants will be asked to complete brief surveys,&#xD;
      online in REDCap, or over the phone with a Research Assistant at weeks 0 and 12 of the study.&#xD;
      REDCap will be used to achieve randomization and its concealment. Statistical analysts will&#xD;
      be blinded to group allocation during data analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RECRUITMENT&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will include community-dwelling seniors (n=45) recruited from the Division of&#xD;
      Geriatric Psychiatry at Parkwood Institute and from the Geriatric Mental Health Program at&#xD;
      London Health Sciences Center, both located in London, Ontario. Participants to these two&#xD;
      programs receive referrals from family doctors serving the city of London and surrounding&#xD;
      Middlesex County. The study will recruit via existing relationships and referrals established&#xD;
      by the study PI and co-investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STATISTICAL ANALYSIS PLAN&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary outcome measures will be calculated using rates, percentages and costs. For&#xD;
      exploratory purposes, the secondary outcome measures will be subject to the following&#xD;
      analyses. A Multivariate Analysis of Variance (MANOVA) will be conducted to detect&#xD;
      differences between the two interventions, i.e. SSIPP and PST as the independent variables&#xD;
      and scores on GAD-7, PHQ-9, and CD-RISC-10 scale as the dependent variables. Multivariate F&#xD;
      value (Wilks' λ or Hotelling's trace or Pillai's trace) will be used with a statistical&#xD;
      significance set at p &lt; 0.05. Demographic measures will be described using either&#xD;
      calculations of means or percentage as required. As there is no consensus or current evidence&#xD;
      recommending an appropriate sample size for feasibility studies, it is advised that&#xD;
      feasibility study samples sizes not be attempted a priori. Pilot studies investigating the&#xD;
      comparable psychotherapies cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) and mindfulness-based&#xD;
      cognitive therapy (MCBT) were able to demonstrate reductions in self-reported anxiety and&#xD;
      depression with a sample size of n=52 and n=30, respectively. Given these effect sizes, the&#xD;
      desired sample size is n=45. Attrition and retention rates will be calculated as feasibility&#xD;
      measures as part of this pilot study to help inform required sample size for a future large,&#xD;
      multi-center RCT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IBM SPSS ® (v26) will be used for the conduction of data analysis. Contingent on final sample&#xD;
      size, either the Kolmogorov-Smirnov or the Shapiro-Wilk test will be used to assess normality&#xD;
      of the data. The Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm will be used to account for missing&#xD;
      data. Analysis will first be carried out using an Intent to Treat (ITT) approach, followed by&#xD;
      per protocol (PP) analyses for the participants who completed the study only. The differences&#xD;
      in anxiety, depression, and resiliency outcomes between the groups at week 0 and week 12 will&#xD;
      be analyzed using a repeated MANOVA test, in both ITT and PP analysis groups.&#xD;
