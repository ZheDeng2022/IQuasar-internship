      To determine whether exercise and nutrition prehabilitation improves patient outcomes after&#xD;
      cancer surgery&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Preliminary qualitative and quantitative studies suggest that there are benefits (reduced&#xD;
      length of stay, improved cardiorespiratory function, reduced postoperative complications and&#xD;
      improved quality of life) when prehabilitation is used with the context of cancer care. In&#xD;
      2017 Macmillian Cancer Support developed a strategic 'Evidence and Insight' review on&#xD;
      prehabilitation. The outcome of this was to incorporate prehabilitation into routine cancer&#xD;
      care and to develop principles and guidance for prehabilitation. This study aims to support&#xD;
      this vision and answer some of the questions on the patients who are most likely to benefit&#xD;
      from prehabilitation and to quantify some of these benefits by investigating the molecular&#xD;
      processes that influence clinical changes&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study primarily seeks to assess the cardiovascular and biological impact of&#xD;
      prehabilitation (exercise, nutrition) on patients undergoing hepatobiliary and colorectal&#xD;
      cancer surgery. The investigators aim to assess whether there is an improvement in various&#xD;
      cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET) variables such as maximum oxygen consumption and&#xD;
      anaerobic threshold. The investigators also aim to study the inflammatory cytokines&#xD;
      associated with cancer and how these markers respond to exercise. These inflammatory markers&#xD;
      are thought to play a role in influencing some clinical outcomes such as wound infection and&#xD;
      recovery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will also assess secondary outcomes including hospital stay, post operative&#xD;
      complications and quality of life. The investigators aim to better understand the biological&#xD;
      relationship between anti-inflammatory cytokine levels and the previously mentioned outcomes&#xD;
      by measuring and analysing these mediators and performing selected muscle biopsies.&#xD;

    <description>This questionnaire assesses perceptions on each of the five dimensions(Identity, Cause, Timeline, Consequences, Cure-Control) by asking patients for their own beliefs about their condition.&#xD;
High scores on the identity, consequences, timeline acute/ chronic and cyclical subscales represent strongly held beliefs about the number of symptoms attributed, the negative consequences, and the chronicity and cyclical nature of the illness.&#xD;
High scores on the identity and cure-control and coherence subscales represent positive beliefs about controllability and a personal understanding of the illness.</description>

    <description>Assessment of participants mental adjustment to a cancer diagnosis. Designed to measure Fighting Spirit (FS), Anxious Preoccupation (AP), Helpless-hopelessness (HH) and Fatalism. This is a 40-item measure of specific psychological (Coping) responses that cancer patients may display in the process of adjusting to the diagnosis and treatment of their disease.&#xD;
A higher score represents higher endorsement of the adjustment response.</description>
