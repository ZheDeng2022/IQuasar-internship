      Arabic is one of the most spoken languages in the world; however, the CARIES-QC questionnaire&#xD;
      which evaluate the effect of oral diseases and disorders on children's oral health-related&#xD;
      quality of life has not yet been validated in Arabic speaking children. So the purpose of&#xD;
      this study was to translate the CARIES-QC into Arabic and test the measurement properties of&#xD;
      the Arabic version of the CARIES-QC for use in children with dental caries who speaks Arabic&#xD;
      .&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Dental caries is a major public health problem. It has been estimated that 621 million&#xD;
      children in the world have untreated dental caries . Dental caries always manifests with&#xD;
      significant pain, affecting oral health-related quality of life (OHRQoL) and well-being.&#xD;
      Several measures were widely used to comprehensively evaluate the effect of oral diseases and&#xD;
      disorders on children's OHRQoL. However, most of these measures were 'generic' measures, and&#xD;
      they may fail to detect small, clinically important changes related to specific oral&#xD;
      diseases. Gilchrist et al recently developed the Caries Impacts and Experiences Questionnaire&#xD;
      for Children (CARIES-QC) in order to address this issue. Preliminary findings have confirmed&#xD;
      that Caries Impacts and Experiences Questionnaire for Children measure had good reliability,&#xD;
      validity, and responsiveness. However, The original CARIES-QC was an English measure; so&#xD;
      appropriate translation and cultural adaptation should be done in order to be used in other&#xD;
      culture and language.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arabic is one of the most spoken languages in the world; however, the CARIES-QC has not yet&#xD;
      been validated in Arabic speaking children. So the purpose of this study was to translate the&#xD;
      CARIES-QC into Arabic and test the measurement properties of the Arabic version of the&#xD;
      CARIES-QC for use in children with dental caries who speaks Arabic .&#xD;
