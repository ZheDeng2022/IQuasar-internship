  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to examine the therapeutic effectiveness of two different exercise&#xD;
      frequencies of high-intensity interval training (HIIT; once versus thrice weekly, with&#xD;
      matched weekly exercise volume) on improving cardiometabolic risk factors in centrally obese&#xD;
      adults.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      HIIT is an emerging, popular, promising, cost-effective, and time-efficient exercise modality&#xD;
      for managing obesity. Although lower-frequency HIIT is favorable for intervention adherence,&#xD;
      the optimal exercise frequency of HIIT for alleviating obesity is unknown.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is a three-arm randomized controlled trial. Centrally obese adults will be&#xD;
      randomly allocated to three groups: the usual care control, once and thrice-weekly HIIT&#xD;
      groups. Led by research personnel, the usual care group will receive obesity-related health&#xD;
      education. Led by athletic coaches, the HIIT intervention groups will receive 16 weeks of&#xD;
      once or thrice weekly HIIT (with matched weekly exercise volume). Outcome measures of this&#xD;
      study will be examined at baseline, 4 months (post-intervention), and 8 months (follow-up),&#xD;
      by assessors blinded to group allocation.&#xD;
