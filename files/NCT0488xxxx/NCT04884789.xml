    <textblock>
      Burn injuries are not a rare affection. According to WHO (World Health Organization), in 2004&#xD;
      there were 11 million peoples in the world who were affected by burn injuries caused by fire&#xD;
      and who needed medical cares. This important number ignores non-fire thermal, chemical and&#xD;
      electrical burns. Face is one of the most susceptible areas of burn where the prevalence was&#xD;
      reported to be 6-60%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypertrophic scars (HS) are frequent consequences of dermal burn with a prevalence of 70% of&#xD;
      burned people. HS, which are a dermal fibro-proliferation, are rigid, erythematous and&#xD;
      thickened scars associated with pigmentation abnormalities, xerosis, thermal sensitivity,&#xD;
      pain and pruritus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When HS is located on the face, they can cause cosmetic disorder with disfigurement and&#xD;
      psychological distress.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pressure therapy and silicone application are the two recommended non-invasive care for&#xD;
      prevention and treatment of hypertrophic scarring after burn. On the face, Pressure Garment&#xD;
      Therapy (PGT) cannot exert the required pressure because of concave or flat shape so the use&#xD;
      of face mask is the most common form of pressure therapy on the face.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The face mask manufacturing is artisanal, time consuming and variable between all burn&#xD;
      centers. They are not very accurate and have difficulties to apply effective pressure on&#xD;
      certain face areas such as nasolabial folds.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our Transparent Face Orthosis (TFO) uses tri-dimensional cam for measurement and 3d-printing&#xD;
      technology for manufacturing. We think this way to manufacture the TFO will be more accurate&#xD;
      and efficient, less expansive and time consuming. Moreover, the addition of a silicone&#xD;
      interface between the TFO and the face will associate silicone application therapy and&#xD;
      pressure therapy what should be more effective than pressure therapy alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to assess the tolerance of tailored 3d-printed transparent face&#xD;
      orthosis used in the medical care of post-burn face scar.&#xD;

    <description>Evaluation of scar evolution by Patient and Observer Scar Assessment Scale (POSAS). It consists of two scales which assesses vascularity, pigmentation, thickness, relief, pliability, and surface area and it incorporates patient assessment of pain, itching, color, stiffness, thickness and relief. All items were evaluated on numerical rating scales ranging from 1 to 10 (with 10 indicating the worst score).</description>

    <description>Evaluation of the quality of life of patients by the BSHS-B (Burn Specific Health Scale - Brief). The BSHS-B consists of 40 items divided into four domains with nine subscales (heat sensitivity, affect, hand function, treatment regimens, work, sexuality, interpersonal relationships, simple abilities and body change). Items are answered on a 5-point Likert scale ranging from 0 (extremely) to 4 (not at all).</description>
