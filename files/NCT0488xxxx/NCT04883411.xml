      The study is a prospective, first-in-human, multi-center, non-randomized, single-arm study to&#xD;
      assess the safety and efficacy of the CEM-Cage used with the CEM-Plate in patients who are&#xD;
      appropriate candidates for a 2-level anterior cervical discectomy and fusion (ACDF). Fifty&#xD;
      patients will be enrolled in the study and, after undergoing a 2-level ACDF, will be&#xD;
      evaluated at 4 weeks, 3 months, 6 months, 12 months, 18 months, and 24 months.&#xD;

      The study is a prospective, first-in-human, multi-center, non-randomized, single-arm study to&#xD;
      assess the safety and efficacy of the CEM-Cage used with the CEM-Plate in patients who are&#xD;
      appropriate candidates for a 2-level anterior cervical discectomy and fusion (ACDF). Fifty&#xD;
      patients will be enrolled in the study and, after undergoing a 2-level ACDF, will be&#xD;
      evaluated at 4 weeks, 3 months, 6 months, 12 months, 18 months, and 24 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study consists of a screening period, surgical procedure, and 6 post-operative visits. At&#xD;
      each indicated visit, quality of life scales and adverse events will be collected. In&#xD;
      addition, at 4 weeks post-operatively, patients will undergo static lateral cervical plain x&#xD;
      rays to assess implant positioning and integrity. At 3 months, 6 months, 12 months, 18&#xD;
      months, and 24 months, patients will undergo flexion/extension and neutral lateral plain&#xD;
      radiographs to assess overall success and fusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study has co-primary endpoints for efficacy (fusion) and overall success where overall&#xD;
      success is defined as fusion, device implanted as intended, no serious adverse events related&#xD;
      to the surgical procedure, no device-related serious adverse events, no subsequent surgical&#xD;
      interventions at the index levels, and absence of clinically significant device malfunctions.&#xD;
      Fusion data will be compared to benchmark data (Davis et al, 2013, control arm of the 2-level&#xD;
      Mobi-C IDE study).&#xD;

             imaging (computed tomography (CT), CT myelography, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI),&#xD;
             or plain radiography).&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Unresponsive to non-operative, conservative treatment for at least 6 weeks from&#xD;
             symptom onset or presence of progressive cervical myelopathy or signs of nerve&#xD;
