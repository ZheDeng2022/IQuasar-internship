  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study examines the feasibility and efficacy of a mobile application (app), which enables&#xD;
      critically ill patients to report perceived patient stressors to their caregivers.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      For many critically ill patients, treatment in an intensive care unit (ICU) is very&#xD;
      stressful, and for some of the patients it is a traumatic experience. The domains of patient&#xD;
      stressors encompass physical stressors, mental health stressors, communication stressors, and&#xD;
      environmental stressors. The experience of stressors during ICU is associated with a higher&#xD;
      risk of worse outcomes including delirium, delayed recovery, and post-intensive care syndrome&#xD;
      (PICS). In the context of inpatient intensive care medicine, health care professionals (HCP)&#xD;
      have problems to correctly rate the extent of their patients' stress.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, we examine the feasibility and efficacy of a stressor-reporting system based&#xD;
      on a mobile application (app), which allows critically ill patients to evaluate by themselves&#xD;
      the intensity of their stressors, and thus, to communicate their stress experience to HCPs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the first assessment phase of this study, outcome data of a cohort of n=20 patients will&#xD;
      be collected (cohort A). Participants of cohort A will not use the ICU Feel Better App. In&#xD;
      the second phase, outcome data of another n=20 patients (cohort B) will be collected.&#xD;
      Participants of cohort B will have the opportunity to use the ICU Feel Better App from the&#xD;
      second day after admission to the ICU until the day of discharge from ICU.&#xD;
