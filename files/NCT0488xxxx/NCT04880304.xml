  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to examine the acute neural responses to subconcussive head&#xD;
      impacts in individuals with Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). The study is&#xD;
      designed to identify the effects of 10 controlled soccer headings in college-aged soccer&#xD;
      players diagnosed with ADHD and without ADHD, through the use of neural-injury blood&#xD;
      biomarkers, functional and diffusion MRI, and ocular-motor function across three acute&#xD;
      timepoints. The central hypothesis is that neuronal structural, physiological, and functional&#xD;
      impairments from subconcussive head impacts will be amplified by ADHD. The neural-injury&#xD;
      blood biomarkers neurofilament light (NF-L), glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP),&#xD;
      ubiquitin C-terminal hydrolase-L1 (UCHL-1), and Tau will be measured in plasma, with the&#xD;
      hypothesis that 10 soccer headings will significantly increase plasma NF-L levels in both&#xD;
      groups at 24h post-heading compared to baseline, but this increase will be higher in the ADHD&#xD;
      group; plasma UCH-L1, GFAP, and Tau levels will increase significantly after 10 headings in&#xD;
      the ADHD group at 2h and 24h post-heading, but levels in the non-ADHD group will remain&#xD;
      consistent throughout the time points. It is also hypothesized that repetitive subconcussive&#xD;
      head impacts will impair neurocognitive function, as measured by regional changes in fMRI&#xD;
      activation during working memory and attention-based tasks, in the ADHD group. Ten headings&#xD;
      will significantly alter fMRI activation in the ADHD group from baseline. This impairment&#xD;
      will not be observed in the non-ADHD group, rather the non-ADHD group will show consistent&#xD;
      fMRI activation even after 10 headings. White matter microstructure will be measured by&#xD;
      diffusion imaging metrics, with the hypothesis that 10 soccer headings will significantly&#xD;
      disrupt microstructure in the ADHD group compared to baseline, but not in the non-ADHD group.&#xD;
      The study will also assess neuro-ophthalmologic function as measured by the King-Devick test&#xD;
      (KDT) and oculomotor function as measured by the near-point-of-convergence (NPC) in response&#xD;
      to subconcussive head impacts. The hypothesis is that NPC performance will be significantly&#xD;
      impaired and persist for longer than 24 hours in both groups, but this impairment will be&#xD;
      greater in the ADHD group, and that the learning curve and expected improvement of KDT will&#xD;
      be significantly blunted in both groups, with a display of worsening in the ADHD group.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      We will recruit participants on a first-come, first-served basis for the ADHD group. We will&#xD;
      select age- and sex-matched controls (e.g., matched to 1st, 3rd, 5th, and 7th ADHD&#xD;
      participants since this is 1:2 frequency-matched sampling) for the non-ADHD group. We propose&#xD;
      to include a total of 60 participants in the study (ADHD n= 40, non-ADHD n=20).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study consists of 3 data collection time points in a 2-day period. The 1st day will last&#xD;
      approximately 4.75 hours and 2nd day will last approximately 1.5 hours. This study design&#xD;
      will enable to test outcome measures over 2 acute phases.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The 1st test session takes place right before the soccer heading intervention&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will perform the soccer heading intervention&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The 2nd test session takes place 2 hours after the soccer heading intervention&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The 3rd test session takes place approximately 24 hours after the intervention&#xD;
&#xD;
      When written informed consent is obtained, we will use a self-reported health questionnaire&#xD;
      to obtain demographic information. The information includes age, sex, BMI, race/ethnicity,&#xD;
      years of soccer playing and heading experience, number and age of previous concussions, and&#xD;
      sleep habits, as well as assessment of other neurological conditions to screen participants'&#xD;
      eligibility. Participants who meet the inclusion criteria and are free of exclusionary&#xD;
      factors will advance to the testing procedures. From 3 days before the study until the 24h&#xD;
      post-heading time point, participants will be instructed to (1) take ADHD medication (for the&#xD;
      ADHD Cohort), (2) refrain from consuming alcohol and recreational drugs, and (3) refrain from&#xD;
      activities that involve head impacts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Soccer Heading Intervention:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A standardized and reliable soccer heading protocol will be used for the experiment. A&#xD;
      triaxial accelerometer and gyroscope (Triax Technologies) embedded in a head-band pocket and&#xD;
      positioned back of the head to monitor linear and rotational head accelerations. A JUGS&#xD;
      soccer machine will be used to simulate a soccer throw-in with a standardized ball speed of&#xD;
      25mph across both groups. The ball speed is similar to when soccer players make a long&#xD;
      throw-in from the sideline to mid-field. Soccer players frequently perform this maneuver&#xD;
      during practice and game. Participants will stand approximately 40ft away from the machine to&#xD;
      perform soccer ball headings. An average linear head acceleration from a header sits around&#xD;
      20 g, while regular corner or goal kicks (~50mph) yield accelerations above 50 g.&#xD;
      Participants in both groups will perform 10 headers with 1 header per minute.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Health Questionnaire Screening:&#xD;
&#xD;
      When written informed consent is obtained, we will use a self-reported health questionnaire&#xD;
      to obtain demographic information. The information includes age, sex, BMI, race/ethnicity,&#xD;
      years of soccer playing and heading experience, number and age of previous concussions, and&#xD;
      sleep habits, as well as assessment of other neurological conditions to screen participants'&#xD;
      eligibility. Before the first and final test session, participants will be asked to verify&#xD;
      that they have slept longer than 4 hours the prior night, did not consume alcohol or&#xD;
      recreational drugs within 3 days before the start of the study, did not participant in&#xD;
      activities that involve head impacts within 3 days before the start of the study, and for the&#xD;
      ADHD group they will be asked to provide the time of when they took their prescribed ADHD&#xD;
      medication for the day. In addition, participants will complete a Participant Health&#xD;
      Screening Checklist with the Imaging Research Facility (IRF) operator prior to participating&#xD;
      in the imaging procedures. This checklist will screen participants for symptoms related to&#xD;
      COVID-19.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ADHD Diagnosis and Screening of Psychiatric Factors and Substance Misuse:&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will use a two-step validation of ADHD diagnosis for both groups. Upon signing the consent&#xD;
      form, ADHD participants will be instructed to submit confirmation of the ADHD diagnosis&#xD;
      evaluated and assigned by their physicians. During a follow-up meeting, we will conduct a&#xD;
      semi-structured diagnostic interview for both groups using the Adult ADHD Investigator&#xD;
      Symptom Rating Scale (AISRS), which is a robust, valid efficacy measure of ADHD symptoms in&#xD;
      adult patients. The assessment will be given by a trained examiner (a clinical social&#xD;
      worker), who will be blinded from the participants' diagnosis status. We will also assess (1)&#xD;
      depression, anxiety, and panic symptoms using the PHQ-9; (2) alcohol use disorder using&#xD;
      AUDIT; and (3) cannabis use disorder using CUDIT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      NPC and KDT:&#xD;
&#xD;
      During each test session, various assessments will be conducted on each participant. First,&#xD;
      ocular assessments consisting of near point of convergence (NPC) and the King-Devick Test&#xD;
      (KDT) will be used to assed ocular-motor function and neuro-ophthalamolgic function,&#xD;
      respectively. The NPC measures the closest point to which one can maintain convergence while&#xD;
      focusing on an object before double vision occurs. Assessment will be repeated twice, and&#xD;
      mean NPC scores will be used for statistical analyses. After they have finished NPC,&#xD;
      participants will complete the KDT. The KDT assesses neuro-ophthalamogic function due to it's&#xD;
      design of saccadic eye movements coupled with multiple facets of brain functions such as&#xD;
      attention, language, and concentration. It will be administrated on a hand- held tablet.&#xD;
      Participants will be given one trial &quot;demonstration&quot; card to practice the task. Following the&#xD;
      demonstration card, participants will tap through 3 test cards. Participants will be asked to&#xD;
      read aloud, left to right and top to bottom, a series of numbers on the test cards as fast&#xD;
      and as accurate as they can while refraining from using his/her fingers as a reading guide.&#xD;
      The 3 test cards progress in difficulty (i.e. guideline disappearance, numbers become more&#xD;
      dense). The KDT records the total time, in seconds, participants spent to complete the task&#xD;
      (all 3 test cards). Accuracy will be recorded by a lab personnel member who will stand behind&#xD;
      the participant and record any errors (incorrect number, missed number, etc.) made during the&#xD;
      testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eye Reflex Assessment (Blinktbi):&#xD;
&#xD;
      The blink reflex is elicited when a stimulus is applied to or near the cornea, immediate area&#xD;
      surrounding the canthus, the eyelashes, or directly to the peri-orbital nerves. This reflex&#xD;
      is facilitated by stimulation to nerves that enter into the brainstem, loops through a number&#xD;
      of brainstem and basal ganglia structures, including the reticular formation and the&#xD;
      dopaminergic systems, and then out to the facial nerves as the actual blink. This provides a&#xD;
      non-invasive way to monitor the integrity of the deep brain structures. It is postulated that&#xD;
      by precisely measuring metrics associated with blink, data can be gathered on the field that&#xD;
      will assist in detecting alterations in brain function suggestive of concussion or more&#xD;
      severe brain injury. An FDA approved Eyestat device will be used for this testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood Biomarkers:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Antecubital vein blood draws will be performed each test session to help determine serum&#xD;
      biomarker concentrations. A trained phlebotomist will thoroughly clean the inner elbow&#xD;
      surface with an alcohol swab and draw 7 ml of whole blood into sterile Vacutainer tubes with&#xD;
      21G butterfly needle. After the blood draw, the participant will use gauze to maintain direct&#xD;
      pressure and a bandage will be provided. Plasma will be assessed by the 4-plex Simoa assay&#xD;
      platform (Quanterix), which is a magnetic bead-based ELISA that allows detection of&#xD;
      biomarkers in femtomolar concentrations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MRI Techniques:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once completing the MRI screening procedure, participants will undergo the following&#xD;
      standardized MRI protocols.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) is the most widely used technique to study the microstructural&#xD;
      integrity of white matter in vivo. DTI provides simple markers, such as mean diffusivity (MD)&#xD;
      and fractional anisotropy (FA), that have been used to reflect microstructural tissue change&#xD;
      during aging, neurological disorders, and traumatic brain injury (i.e., concussion). However,&#xD;
      despite their sensitivity, MD and FA represent cellular diffusivity estimated by basic&#xD;
      statistical descriptions that do not directly correspond to biophysiological parameters of&#xD;
      the neural cellular integrity. DTI assumes Gaussian diffusion within a single microstructural&#xD;
      compartment and thus has proven non-specific to axonal structural damage. To address this&#xD;
      limitation, neurite orientation dispersion and density imaging (NODDI) has been characterized&#xD;
      to assess microstructural integrity of axons using a non-Gaussian model with multiple&#xD;
      compartments. NODDI allows researchers to measure axonal density within white matter,&#xD;
      orientation of axonal dispersion, and free water diffusion. The combined approach using NODDI&#xD;
      and DTI will uncover greater depth of progressive axonal degeneration in response to&#xD;
      repetitive subconcussive head impacts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Flanker Task: The Flanker test measures participants' ability to focus attention and ignore&#xD;
      irrelevant information. Therefore, the Flanker task will assess the changes in attention in&#xD;
      participants over time. For this task, while in the scanner, participants will be presented&#xD;
      with a set of 5 arrows above the fixation point. They will be instructed to only respond to&#xD;
      the direction of the central arrow. If the arrow is pointing to the left, participants will&#xD;
      be instructed to press the index button of the controller in their left hand. If the arrow is&#xD;
      pointing to the right, participants will be instructed to press the index button of the&#xD;
      controller in their right hand. Participants will be read instructions prior to the test and&#xD;
      will be permitted to press both index buttons to assure there is an understanding. The task&#xD;
      will run for a total of approximately 10 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      N-Back Tasks: The n-back task will be used to asses both verbal (letters) and visual (blocks)&#xD;
      memory. For the verbal n-back tasks, while in the scanner, participants will be presented a&#xD;
      series of letters, with letters being displayed on the screen one at a time. Participants&#xD;
      will be instructed to answer whether the target letter is the same or different from the&#xD;
      letter presented, if it the presented target is the same or different from the letter&#xD;
      presented 1-back or 2-back letters prior. If the target letter is the same, participants will&#xD;
      be instructed to press the index button of the controller in their left hand and if the&#xD;
      letter is different, participants will be instructed to press the index button of the&#xD;
      controller in their right hand. For the visual n-back tasks, the design and instructions will&#xD;
      be the same, but letters will be replaced with simple abstract objects. Participants will be&#xD;
      read instructions prior to the test and will be permitted to press both index buttons to&#xD;
      assure there is an understanding. The n-back tasks are performed as a block design, with a&#xD;
      total duration of about 15 minutes.&#xD;
