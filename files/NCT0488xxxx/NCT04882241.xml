      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of pembrolizumab (MK-3745) in the&#xD;
      neoadjuvant (prior to surgery) or adjuvant (after surgery) treatment of previously untreated&#xD;
      Chinese adults with gastric and gastroesophageal junction (GEJ) adenocarcinoma. No formal&#xD;
      hypothesis testing will be done.&#xD;
