      Pilot randomized trial of a technology-based intervention to reduce sugary drink consumption&#xD;
      and promote water intake in families with young children.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a pilot 2-arm randomized trial among 60 families of 1-8 year old children who&#xD;
      currently over-consume sugary drinks. The study team will randomize families to either an&#xD;
      intervention group, that will receive a behavioral intervention consisting of an educational&#xD;
      video, water promotion toolkit, mobile phone app, and series of educational phone calls, or&#xD;
      to a control group that will not receive this intervention. The study team will compare&#xD;
      6-month change in child and parental beverage consumption between groups. Exploratory&#xD;
      analyses will examine child weight (kg) and Body Mass Index (BMI) z-score (BMIz) outcomes,&#xD;
      and compare intervention effects across race/ethnic groups.&#xD;
