  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study conducted a systematic clinical observation of the clinical efficacy of UCB-MNCs&#xD;
      in the treatment of hormone-resistant or hormone-dependent ulcerative colitis, in order to&#xD;
      observe its clinical safety and efficacy.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study adopts a randomized and controlled clinical research design. Patients are randomly&#xD;
      divided into conventional treatment control group and UCB-MNCs treatment test group. The&#xD;
      control group is given conventional treatment: prednisone combined azathioprine or&#xD;
      adalimumab; the test group is given conventional treatment combined UCB-MNCs treatment,&#xD;
      follow-up observations were carried out, in order to observe the clinical efficacy and safety&#xD;
      of UCB-MNCs in the treatment of hormone resistance or hormone-dependent ulcerative colitis.&#xD;

    <measure>Clinical efficacy rate</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline Clinical efficacy rate at 8th and 16th week, and the first week after the end of treatment.</time_frame>
    <description>According to the method of modified Mayo score calculation, it is defined as a decrease of ≥30% of the score or a decrease of ≥3 points relative to the baseline value, and a decrease of ≥1 point or a score of 0 or 1 in the sub-item score of blood in the stool, and this type of patient is judged Effective for treatment. Clinical effective rate = (effective number of people / total number of people in this group ) × 100%.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Clinical response rate</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline Clinical response rate at 8th and 16th week, and the first week after the end of treatment.</time_frame>
    <description>According to the method of modified Mayo score calculation, it is defined as a score ≤ 2 points and no single sub-item score&gt; 1 point. Clinical remission rate =(number of remissions / total number of people in this group) × 100%.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Clinical symptom score</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline clinical symptom score at the first week after the end of treatment.</time_frame>
    <description>According to the scoring criteria for individual symptoms (diarrhea, mucus pus and blood in the stool, abdominal pain, tenesmus), the severity of symptoms is divided into 0, 2, 4, and 6 points. The higher the score, the more severe the symptoms.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Endoscopic response rate</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline endoscopic response rate at the first week after the end of treatment.</time_frame>
    <description>According to the method of modified Mayo score, endoscopy found that the score decreased by at least 1 point from baseline. Endoscopic response rate = (number of endoscopic responders/total number of people in the group) × 100%.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Mucosal healing rate</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline mucosal healing rate at the first week after the end of treatment.</time_frame>
    <description>According to the method of modified Mayo score, the absolute score of the endoscopy discovery score is 0 or 1 point. Mucosal healing rate = (mucosal healing number / total number of people in this group) × 100%.</description>
