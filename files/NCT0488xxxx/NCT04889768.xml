  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is no currently available treatment for peritoneal metastasis of gastric cancer.&#xD;
      Hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC) can not only maintain the high&#xD;
      concentration of drugs in the abdominal cavity, but also improve the anti-tumor efficacy of&#xD;
      chemotherapy drugs through the thermo-thermal effect. In recent years, immunotherapy has made&#xD;
      great progress in the treatment of gastric cancer. We want to explore the hyperthermic&#xD;
      intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC) combined with Camrelizumab (SHR-1210) and intravenous&#xD;
      chemotherapy for Creating the Operation Chance in advanced gastric cancer with peritoneal&#xD;
      metastasis.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To assess the effectiveness and safety of Hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy,&#xD;
      anti-PD-1 antibody Camrelizumab (SHR-1210), intravenous chemotherapy combined with surgery&#xD;
      for the treatment of advanced gastric cancer with peritoneal metastasis, so as to further&#xD;
      find out the optimal protocol for the Conversion therapy in the patients with advanced&#xD;
      gastric cancer.&#xD;
