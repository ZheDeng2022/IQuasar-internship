  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Data on pain after COVID-19 were generally collected from hospitalized patients and only&#xD;
      include information on acute pain conditions. However, the characteristics of the chronic&#xD;
      pain experienced after COVID-19 are unknown. For this reason, the treatment and&#xD;
      recommendations for patients who present with chronic pain after COVID-19 are not clear. Our&#xD;
      goal is to determine the characteristics and risk factors of chronic pain developing in&#xD;
      COVID-19 patients and to create specific treatment recommendations for these patient groups&#xD;
      with further studies.&#xD;

      Data on pain developing after COVID-19 were generally collected from hospitalized patients&#xD;
      and only include information on acute pain conditions seen after the ilness. It is noteworthy&#xD;
      that headache and musculoskeletal pain were seen common in first few weeks. However, the&#xD;
      characteristics (mechanical, inflammatory, central sensitization, anxiety-related, etc.) of&#xD;
      the chronic pain experienced are unknown. For this reason, the treatment and recommendations&#xD;
      for patients who present with chronic pain after COVID-19 are not clear. Our goal is to&#xD;
      determine the characteristics and risk factors of chronic pain developing in COVID-19&#xD;
      patients and to create specific treatment recommendations for these patient groups with&#xD;
      further studies.&#xD;
