      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In idiopathic Parkinson's disease, 50% of patients develop in the course of the disease a&#xD;
      dysphagia and aspiration pneumonia is the leading cause of death in all parkinsonian&#xD;
      syndromes . Dysphagia can negatively impact on the course of Parkinson's disease due to&#xD;
      complications such as aspiration pneumonia, malnutrition, inadequate drug action, it causes a&#xD;
      deterioration in quality of life and leads to an increase in health care costs of more than&#xD;
      10% Therefore, it is very important to detect subclinical dysphagia in time in Parkinson's&#xD;
      disease and to initiate a targeted swallowing therapy. In the Neurological Rehabilitation&#xD;
      Center Rosenhügel, patients with Parkinson's disease participate in the Parkinson&#xD;
      rehabilitation pathway during their rehabilitation program. A part of the Parkinson&#xD;
      rehabilitation pathway is the dysphagia pathway. It includes a clinical swallowing&#xD;
      examination, an instrumental assessment of swallowing, performed by a fiberoptic endoscopic&#xD;
      evaluation of swallowing (FEES) and a dysphagia training. Because of the serious clinical&#xD;
      consequences of dysphagia, the investigators decided to further evaluate the prevalence of&#xD;
      subclinical and clinical dysphagia in Parkinson's disease and to assess the efficacy of the&#xD;
      NRZ dysphagia pathway. Our goal is to detect and classify all Parkinson's disease patients&#xD;
      with dysphagia and to prevent the complications of dysphagia by an early therapeutic&#xD;
      intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives Primary objective: Evaluation of prevalence of dysphagia in Parkinson's disease&#xD;
      Secondary objective: Evaluation of the impact of the NRZ dysphagia pathway on the severity of&#xD;
      dysphagia through vocal training or dysphagia training Methods A prospective cohort study&#xD;
      will be conducted for 24 months. All patients with the diagnosis of a Parkinson's disease,&#xD;
      who are treated as inpatients in the Neurological Rehabilitation Center Rosenhügel from&#xD;
      5/2020 till 5/2022 and have signed an informed consent form will be enrolled in the study.&#xD;
      The patients will be examined for dysphagia by a clinical swallowing examination, by a FEES&#xD;
      and by measuring the swallowing related quality of life before and after dysphagia training.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention A dysphagia training, which consists of a biofeedback therapy and a swallow&#xD;
      training or a voice training. The intervention lasts 3 weeks, by extended stay it lasts 5 or&#xD;
      7 weeks.&#xD;

      dysphagia and aspiration pneumonia is the leading cause of death in all parkinsonian&#xD;
      syndromes. Dysphagia in idiopathic Parkinson's disease is subjectively perceived and&#xD;
      communicated only in the late stages. Dysphagia can negatively impact on the course of&#xD;
      Parkinson's disease due to complications such as aspiration pneumonia, malnutrition,&#xD;
      inadequate drug action, it causes a deterioration in quality of life and leads to an increase&#xD;
      in health care costs of more than 10% . Therefore, it is very important to detect subclinical&#xD;
      dysphagia in time in Parkinson's disease and to initiate a targeted swallowing therapy.&#xD;
      Simple screening methods are insufficient for the diagnosis of subclinical swallowing&#xD;

      Results The primary endpoint is the prevalence of clinical and subclinical dysphagia in&#xD;
      patients with Parkinsons'disease. Secondary endpoints are the change in the food texture&#xD;
      modification categorie as well as the changes in the liquid texture modification categorie,&#xD;
      in the Rosenbek Penetration-Aspiration Scale, in the drooling scale an in the&#xD;
      swallowing-related quality of life.&#xD;
