  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19), suddenly incepted in December 2019 in Wuhan, China,&#xD;
      leading to one of the greatest health care emergencies of the last century. Acute&#xD;
      exacerbation of the COVID-19 can develop to an ARDS in a significant proportion of&#xD;
      hospitalized cases, leading to invasive mechanical ventilation requirement and in some cases&#xD;
      even mandating use of extra-corporeal membrane oxygenation. Being a disease having affected&#xD;
      up to 15'581'009 as of July 25th, with more than 635'173 deaths, the long-term repercussions&#xD;
      are of foremost importance. Health care systems world-wide will be faced with the aftermath&#xD;
      of COVID-19, and optimal understanding of the long-term progression of COVID-19 may aid in a&#xD;
      better care of critically ill patients and enable specifically targeted rehabilitation&#xD;
      programs to improve outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objective of this study is to assess the repercussions of COVID-19 induced critical&#xD;
      illness on long-term functional status, quality-of-life, neuropsychology and cognition&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Health-care systems are ever improving, organ-support is advancing towards un-thought of&#xD;
      possibilities and critical care medicine is becoming a field of evidence. As a consequence&#xD;
      critical illness is bridgeable in many cases and intensive care unit (ICU) and hospital&#xD;
      outcomes account for excellent survival numbers. In contrast to intensivist believes for&#xD;
      decades nevertheless, a patient's life is not restored to normality the moment ICU survival&#xD;
      is achieved, the real crucible is but starting at that moment. Sequela after critical illness&#xD;
      are manifold and impact the functional status, quality-of-life, neuropsychology as well as&#xD;
      cognition of patients surviving, leading to higher incidences of co-morbidities and a&#xD;
      shortened life-expectancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specifically reflecting the complex interplay between acute respiratory distress syndrome and&#xD;
      long-term outcomes, the last decade has seen a plethora of research elaborating on the&#xD;
      long-term outcomes of patients having suffered acute respiratory distress syndrome. The&#xD;
      serious functional limitations in patients post critical illness were mainly linked to muscle&#xD;
      wasting and weakness, and only secondarily to lung function, neuropathies and other&#xD;
      etiologies. Further, the impaired neuropsychological status, especially mediated by&#xD;
      posttraumatic stress disorder, and cognitive status have a great impact on the reduced health&#xD;
      status and quality-of-life. On the other hand nevertheless, pulmonary function was near&#xD;
      normal after up-to 5 years of follow-up. Finally, the impact of acute respiratory distress&#xD;
      syndrome (ARDS) and critical illness have on caregivers should not be forgotten, with high&#xD;
      levels of depressive symptoms having been reported.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Similar sequela were also described during the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)&#xD;
      epidemic in 2003.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19), suddenly incepted in December 2019 in Wuhan, China,&#xD;
      leading to one of the greatest health care emergencies of the last century. Acute&#xD;
      exacerbation of the COVID-19 can develop to an ARDS in a significant proportion of&#xD;
      hospitalized cases, leading to invasive mechanical ventilation requirement and in some cases&#xD;
      even mandating use of extra-corporeal membrane oxygenation. The median length of stay and of&#xD;
      mechanical ventilation support in COVID-19 have been shown to be elevated in comparison to&#xD;
      other ARDS etiologies. Being a disease having affected up to 92 million people during the&#xD;
      year 2020, with more than 1.9 Million deaths reported, the long-term repercussions are of&#xD;
      foremost importance. Health care systems world-wide will be faced with the aftermath of&#xD;
      COVID-19, and optimal understanding of the long-term progression of COVID-19 may aid in a&#xD;
      better care of critically ill patients and enable specifically targeted rehabilitation&#xD;
      programs to improve outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The overall objective of this study is therefore to evaluate the long-term outcomes of&#xD;
      COVID-19 induced critical illness regarding functional status, quality-of-life,&#xD;
      neuropsychology and cognition.&#xD;
