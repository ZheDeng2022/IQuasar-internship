    <textblock>
      The CLI-01535AA02-2 Study is an exploratory study designed to compare two pressurised metered&#xD;
      Dose inhalers on subject's perception of asthma symptoms.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Outpatients attending the hospital clinics/study centers will be recruited. Moderate to&#xD;
      severe asthma adult subjects will be recruited. A total of 75 subjects will be enrolled. The&#xD;
      whole study will last approximately 6 weeks for each subject.&#xD;

Summarised on the safety set by treatment group as the number of subjects, percentage of subjects, and number of events. All adverse events starting on or after the time of first study drug intake will be classified as TEAE. Any adverse events started after the informed consent signature and before the time of first study drug intake will be classified as pre-treatment adverse event.</description>
