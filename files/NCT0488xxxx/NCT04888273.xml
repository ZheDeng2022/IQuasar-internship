  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Teenagers with eating disorders often experience a disruption in care upon turning 18. At&#xD;
      this age, they are no longer eligible to receive pediatric treatment but are also not yet set&#xD;
      up with the appropriate adult services. There are currently no supports in place to help&#xD;
      youth with eating disorders and their families during this transition from child to adult&#xD;
      care. In this project, the investigators will be implementing an intervention designed to&#xD;
      improve this transition experience; it will include peer support, parent education, a meeting&#xD;
      with the child and adult care providers, contact with the family doctor, and a written guide&#xD;
      about the transition. Among 10 adolescent-parent pairs leaving McMaster Children's Hospital&#xD;
      to adult programs in Hamilton, Ontario, the investigators will assess how feasible the&#xD;
      intervention is to implement, how feasible the chosen measures are, participants' experience&#xD;
      of the intervention, how many adolescents actually transition to adult care, as well as a few&#xD;
      adolescent and parent outcomes, such as how prepared the teen feels or what the parents'&#xD;
      needs are.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Eating disorders (EDs) are severe psychiatric illnesses that negatively impact the health and&#xD;
      quality of life of sufferers and their families. EDs typically begin in adolescence and often&#xD;
      progress into adulthood, often requiring youth to transition from pediatric to adult mental&#xD;
      health services. However, patients often experience a discontinuity in care due to a lack of&#xD;
      coordinated transition between services, which has a significant impact on their health.&#xD;
      Although barriers to a smooth transition and solutions to mend the gap have been identified&#xD;
      in the literature, there is no stakeholder-informed protocol in Canada to address this issue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this project is to develop and test a protocol to support the health services&#xD;
      transition from pediatric to adult treatment for adolescents with EDs and their families.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators have prepared a protocol aimed at improving this transition experience&#xD;
      using suggestions from the existing literature. The investigators will also invite&#xD;
      stakeholders to offer recommendations for its local use. The proposed suite of interventions&#xD;
      will be tested in a sample of adolescents who are in treatment at a pediatric ED program&#xD;
      based in Hamilton, Ontario during their transition to adult services, along with their&#xD;
      parents. The investigators will report upon enrolment and retention rates into adult&#xD;
      programs, feasibility indicators of the intervention and research procedures, self-reported&#xD;
      readiness to transition, post-transition qualitative interviews with adolescents and parents&#xD;
      regarding their experience, and written reflections by all participants regarding each&#xD;
      intervention component. The eligibility criteria and outcome measures will be elaborated upon&#xD;
      below.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If this study is successful, the investigators will test the feasibility, acceptability, and&#xD;
      cost of this protocol across pediatric ED programs in Ontario, and eventually Canada. This&#xD;
      innovative protocol has the potential to improve health outcomes for this population, to&#xD;
      decrease long-term disability costs associated with EDs, and to improve the quality and&#xD;
      success of the mental health service delivery that directly influences the quality of life of&#xD;
      Canadian youth and families affected by EDs.&#xD;

    <time_frame>At Baseline (0 weeks) and Post-Intervention (12 weeks) of each adolescent's time in the intervention</time_frame>
    <description>The investigators will capture the adolescent's self-reported readiness and motivation to change various eating disorder behaviours before and after the adolescent completes the intervention using the Eating Disorders Readiness Ruler (ED-RR). The first 9 items (from 1 to 10) measure readiness to change (minimum score of 9 to a maximum of 90). Higher scores for these items indicates increased willingness to change. The last 9 items measure the extent to which the change is being made for others versus for themselves on a scale from 10% to 100%. A &quot;controlled motivation&quot; score of 1 is assigned to responses from 0 to 30% (change is for others) and an &quot;autonomous motivation&quot; score of 1 is assigned to responses from 80-100% (change is for themselves). Total scores for each motivation type are computed, ranging from 0 to 9.&#xD;
Repeated Measures design will be used to analyze the mean difference in the total score for each domain from baseline to post-intervention.</description>

    <measure>Change in Parent's Perceived Needs as a Carer of an Individual with an Eating Disorder- Carers Needs Assessment Measure</measure>
    <time_frame>At Baseline (0 weeks) and Post-Intervention (12 weeks) of each parent's time in the intervention</time_frame>
    <description>The investigators will capture the parent's self-reported needs as the carer of an individual with an eating disorder before and after the parent completes the intervention using the Carers Needs Assessment Measure (CaNAM). This tool contains 32 Likert-scale items (from 0 to 2) across three domains: information about eating disorders, support from people/organizations, and support for yourself (minimum total score of 0 and maximum of 64). Higher scores indicate that the respondent is satisfied with the resources/information they've received. The final domain contains 15 yes/no questions regarding areas where the respondent may appreciate help. The 4 remaining open-ended questions ask the respondent elaborate upon each domain.&#xD;
Repeated Measures design will be used to analyze the mean difference in total score and subscales of this measure from baseline to post-intervention. A descriptive summary will be used to summarize the responses to the open-ended questions.</description>
