  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) is overexpressed or amplified in 10-20% of&#xD;
      gastric or gastroesophageal junction cancer. Trastuzumab combined with fluorouracil and&#xD;
      platinum has been established as first-line treatment for patients with HER2-positive gastric&#xD;
      cancer. The role of trastuzumab in second-line treatment for HER2-positive gastric cancer has&#xD;
      not yet been addressed. Here, we evaluated the safety and efficacy of adding trastuzumab to&#xD;
      ramucirumab and paclitaxel combination as a second-line treatment in HER2-positive gastric&#xD;
      cancer progressed after trastuzumab-containing chemotherapy.&#xD;
