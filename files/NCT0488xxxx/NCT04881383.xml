  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Many DM and pre-DM remain undiagnosed. The aim is to develop and validate a risk prediction&#xD;
      function to detect DM and pre-DM in Chinese adults aged 18-84 in primary care (PC). The&#xD;
      objectives are to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Develop a risk prediction function using non-laboratory parameters to predict DM and&#xD;
           pre-DM from the data of the HK Population Health Survey 2014/2015&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Develop a risk scoring algorithm and determine the cut-off score&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Validate the risk prediction function and determine its sensitivity in predicting DM and&#xD;
           pre-DM in PC&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis to be tested:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The prediction function developed from the Population Health Survey (PHS) 2014/2015 is valid&#xD;
      and sensitive in PC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design and subjects:&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will develop a risk prediction function for DM and pre-DM using data of 1,857 subjects&#xD;
      from the PHS 2014/2015. We will recruit 1014 Chinese adults aged 18-84 from PC clinics to&#xD;
      validate the risk prediction function. Each subject will complete an assessment on the&#xD;
      relevant risk factors and have a blood test on OGTT and HbA1c on recruitment and at 12&#xD;
      months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main outcome measures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The area under the Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, sensitivity and specificity&#xD;
      of the prediction function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data analysis and expected results:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Machine learning and Logistic regressions will be used to develop the best model. ROC curve&#xD;
      will be used to determine the cut-off score. Sensitivity and specificity will be determined&#xD;
      by descriptive statistics. A new HK Chinese general population specific risk prediction&#xD;
      function will enable early case finding and intervention to prevent DM and DM complications&#xD;
      in PC.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Diabetes Mellitus (DM) is the second most common chronic non-communicable disease (NCD) and a&#xD;
      major public health issue. In 2017, it was estimated that 451 million adults worldwide had&#xD;
      DM, a number that is anticipated to rise to 693 million by 2045. In terms of economic burden,&#xD;
      it was estimated that the global cost of DM in 2015 was 1·31 trillion US dollars, which&#xD;
      accounted for 1.8% of global gross domestic product. In China, the prevalence of DM has&#xD;
      increased rapidly, from less than 1% in 1980 to 10.9% in 2013, with approximately 109.6&#xD;
      million Chinese adults (25.8% of all cases worldwide) currently living with the condition.&#xD;
      Among the Chinese population, Hong Kong has one of the highest prevalence of DM. The&#xD;
      Population Health Survey (PHS) 2014/2015 conducted by Department of Health found a prevalence&#xD;
      of 8.4% of DM among persons aged 15-84 in Hong Kong, more than half (4.5%) of which were&#xD;
      previously unknown. Data (unpublished) from the Population Health Survey 2014/2015 showed a&#xD;
      further 9.5% of persons aged 15-84 had hyperglycaemia (pre-diabetes) but were unaware of the&#xD;
      problem before the survey DM can result in severe complications, which lead to disabling&#xD;
      morbidity and premature mortality. A number of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) have found&#xD;
      that lifestyle interventions (e.g., diet, exercise) and pharmacological treatments are&#xD;
      effective in preventing DM and its complications. However, it has been reported that 224&#xD;
      million adults (49.7% of all cases) world-wide are unaware that they have the condition,&#xD;
      similar to the finding of the Hong Kong PHS 2014/2015. DM can be present for 9-12 years prior&#xD;
      to a diagnosis and is often only detected when patients present with complications. Hence,&#xD;
      there is an urgent need for earlier detection of DM so that appropriate interventions can be&#xD;
      provided to prevent and/or delay progression to complications. It would be even more&#xD;
      effective if individuals could be identified at the pre-diabetes (pre-DM) stage when there&#xD;
      may still be an opportunity to revert to normoglycaemia by life-style modifications. While DM&#xD;
      satisfies all Wilson and Jungner's (1968) criteria of screening studies have shown that&#xD;
      general population screening is not effective and the current recommendation is case finding&#xD;
      targeting at high-risk individuals. The Hong Kong Reference Framework for Diabetes Care for&#xD;
      Adults in Primary Care Settings recommends periodic screening for DM among persons aged &gt;=45&#xD;
      years old or having DM risk factors. The recommended methods for screening include 75-g oral&#xD;
      glucose tolerance tests (OGTT), fasting plasma glucose (FPG) tests or HbA1c tests. Indeed, a&#xD;
      cost-effectiveness analysis reported that screening for DM and prediabetes was cost-saving&#xD;
      among patients identified as being at high risk (e.g., body mass index (BMI) &gt; 35 kg/m(2),&#xD;
      systolic blood pressure ≥ 130mmHg or &gt; 55 years of age) when compared with no screening. In&#xD;
      order to identify high risk individuals more accurately, multivariate risk prediction models&#xD;
      have been developed and incorporated into DM prevention programs in a number of Western&#xD;
      countries. Such models have included sociodemographic factors (e.g., age, sex), clinical&#xD;
      factors (e.g., family history of DM, gestational DM) or biomarkers (e.g., BMI, blood&#xD;
      pressure). However, the majority of these models were developed primarily in Caucasian&#xD;
      populations and have not performed as well among Chinese populations. For example, the&#xD;
      Prospective Cardiovascular Münster, Cambridge, San Antonia and Framingham models were found&#xD;
      to have inferior discrimination in a cohort of Chinese people. This can be due to ethnic&#xD;
      differences as well as lifestyle and socioeconomic factors, calling for the need of&#xD;
      population-specific risk prediction models. Since 2009, a number of risk prediction models&#xD;
      and scoring algorithms have been developed specifically for Chinese populations, mostly from&#xD;
      Mainland China, only two of which were developed and validated on Hong Kong Chinese people.&#xD;
      The first used simple self-reported factors and laboratory measurements to develop a scoring&#xD;
      algorithm. However, the generalisability of the model to primary care patients may be limited&#xD;
      as 70% of the subjects of the development and validation samples had known risk factors for&#xD;
      DM. The second risk prediction model for Hong Kong Chinese was previously developed by&#xD;
      members of the investigators' team with data from 3,357 asymptomatic non-diabetic&#xD;
      professional drivers. Non-laboratory risk factors included age, BMI, family history of DM,&#xD;
      regular physical activity (PA), and high blood pressure. Triglyceride was added to the&#xD;
      laboratory-based algorithm. The application of this risk predication model is limited because&#xD;
      the sample was predominately male (92.7%) professional drivers and the accuracy was modest.&#xD;
      It is noted that the majority of factors included in previous models are non-modifiable&#xD;
      (e.g., family history of DM, gestational DM, age), and there is a call for future research to&#xD;
      incorporate more lifestyle factors in order to improve the predictive validity and impact of&#xD;
      risk prediction models. Lifestyle factors that may be associated with DM and pre-DM include&#xD;
      physical activity (PA) level, dietary factors (e.g., fibre, sugar or fat intake), alcohol&#xD;
      consumption, smoking and sleep. This proposed study aims to develop a new DM and pre-DM risk&#xD;
      prediction model specific for the Hong Kong general Chinese population that incorporates&#xD;
      traditional and modifiable life style factors. The investigators will apply the novel method&#xD;
      of machine learning as well as the traditional logistic regression in model development to&#xD;
      improve predictive power. The investigators hope the results will enable the implementation&#xD;
      of effective case finding of DM and pre-DM in primary care, and prevent mortality and&#xD;
      morbidity from this common but silent NCD for the people in Hong Kong.&#xD;
