  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To evaluate the efficiencies of local corticosteroid injections and local anesthetics in&#xD;
      patients with concomitant pes anserine bursitis and osteoarthritis.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Several treatment options have been tried with varying success rates, including nonsteroidal&#xD;
      anti-inflammatory drugs, physiotherapy modalities, cold application with ice-packs, and&#xD;
      injection of local anesthetics and/or corticosteroids. Despite a relatively high frequency of&#xD;
      this painful condition, surprisingly, few studies have evaluated treatment strategies in&#xD;
      randomized controlled study design. To the best of our knowledge, no study in the literature&#xD;
      made a comparison of the efficacy of local anesthetic and corticosteroid injections in&#xD;
      addition to physiotherapy in the treatment of pes anserine bursitis yet. Thus, we aimed to&#xD;
      compare the treatment efficacies of physiotherapy alone, physiotherapy + local anesthetic&#xD;
      injection, and physiotherapy + local corticosteroid injection in a randomized controlled&#xD;
      study design in patients with concomitant osteoarthritis and pes anserine bursitis.&#xD;

    <measure>Visual analogue scale</measure>
    <time_frame>eight weeks</time_frame>
    <description>We used paper-based VAS to evaluate the baseline severity and changes in the intensity of pain by different interventions in the entire study cohort. The visual analogue scale was devised by Hayes and Patterson and is used to document pain rating. Subjects self-report the intensity of their pain by placing a handwritten mark at one point of the length of a ten-centimeter line. The two ends of the scale line represent &quot;no pain&quot; and &quot;worst pain experienced&quot; at the zero cm and 10th cm of the scale, respectively.</description>

    <measure>Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index</measure>
    <time_frame>eight weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) is a self-administered questionnaire comprising 24 items in three different domains. The index measure pain, stiffness, and physical functional disability. Pain, stiffness, and physical functional disability subscales comprise five, two, and seventeen questions, respectively. All subscales consist of 5 answer choices, which range from zero, &quot;not present,&quot; to four, &quot;very severe.&quot;</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>3-meter walk test</measure>
    <time_frame>eight weeks</time_frame>
    <description>We used 3MWT to evaluate the walking speed of the study participants. In this test, the individual is instructed to stand up while they are sitting on a chair with arm support. And then, the person is asked to walk as much distance as possible in 3 minutes without running. The walking time is measured in seconds and recorded, and the walking speed is evaluated for the corresponding age group.</description>

    <description>34 patients who were diagnosed with concomitant knee osteoarthritis and pes anserine bursitis and met inclusion criteria were included in the study. Inclusion criteria were as follows: having stage II-IV knee osteoarthritis along with pes anserine bursitis, duration of symptoms for more than three months, and age between 20 and 70 years. Primary knee osteoarthritis was diagnosed as per American College of Rheumatology (ACR) criteria and graded via Kellgren-Lawrence radiological classification included in this study.</description>
