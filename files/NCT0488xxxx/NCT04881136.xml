      The Falls Predictor Clinical Investigation is a research study that aims to investigate the&#xD;
      value of an update (Falls Prediction RAMware) to an implantable cardiac monitoring device&#xD;
      (The Reveal LINQ™) in predicting unexplained falls. The Reveal LINQ™ is an implantable&#xD;
      cardiac monitoring system manufactured by Medtronic that has the ability to monitor heart&#xD;
      rate, rhythm and activity and is preprogrammed to detect abnormalities. An R&amp;D team at&#xD;
      Medtronic has been collaborating with the study PI Prof Rose Anne Kenny on this project they&#xD;
      are responsible for developing a software update for the Reveal LINQ™ that would enable the&#xD;
      device to collect additional sensor data such as accelerometer (step count) and Posture&#xD;
      change. The additional investigational fields along with the standard cardiac fields that are&#xD;
      monitored may be useful in predicting or identifying physiological changes before a fall. The&#xD;
      study will involve up to 30 patients, recruited and consented from recurrent non-accidental&#xD;
      fallers referred to the Falls and Syncope Unit at St James's Hospital, Dublin.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Falls are an evolving frailty state and are the most common reason for older adults to attend&#xD;
      the Emergency Room (ER) and for admission to long term institutional care. The Irish&#xD;
      Longitudinal Study on Ageing (TILDA) has shown that almost 40% of older adults reported at&#xD;
      least one fall during a four year period and almost 50% had 'fear of falling', an independent&#xD;
      risk factor for falls and loss of independence. New mechanisms for monitoring early risk&#xD;
      factors for falls will advance prevention and management of these conditions, improving&#xD;
      healthcare and supporting independent living.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Implantable devices are a new addition to the sensor market, and as yet have limited&#xD;
      capabilities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is focused on 'unexplained' or 'non accidental' falls- that is falls which are not&#xD;
      clearly due to a slip or a trip. Previous research shows that a high number of these may be&#xD;
      due to changes in heart rate and irregular heartbeats (heart rhythm). There may also be other&#xD;
      changes associated with non accidental falls, such as activity levels i.e. how active you are&#xD;
      in the time before a fall.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients under the care of FASU undergo a full clinical assessment, where the medical team&#xD;
      aim to identify and treat factors which might contribute to falls. They often manage such&#xD;
      falls by implanting a monitoring device which will measure heart rate and rhythm. The Reveal&#xD;
      LINQ™ device from Medtronic™, is the implantable monitoring device which is used in FASU.&#xD;
      There is scope to further develop implantable devices such as the Reveal LINQ™ to monitor&#xD;
      additional physiological parameters, which may help identify fall risk factors. Medtronic in&#xD;
      collaboration with the PI Prof Kenny have developed a RAMware update for the Reveal LINQ™&#xD;
      which will enable the collection of additional sensor information. The Falls Prediction&#xD;
      RAMware is programmed externally to the Reveal LINQ™, there are no changes to the physical&#xD;
      properties of the device.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Aim:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this project is to use the investigational build on previous work and use an&#xD;
      implantable device (Reveal LINQ™) to monitor cardiac parameters, such as heart rate, rhythm&#xD;
      and variability and to enhance the monitoring capabilities of the device with additional&#xD;
      investigational software (Falls Predictor RAMware), creating the Reveal LINQ ™ Falls&#xD;
      Prediction System (LINQ FP). The RAMware update will enable the Reveal LINQ™ device to&#xD;
      collect additional sensor information including temperature, posture, accelerometer (step&#xD;
      measure) and impedance measure (information on activity and fluid status), to identify early&#xD;
      changes in these measures that may indicate increased risk of a fall.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a prospective, single centre, pilot feasibility study, which aims to investigate the&#xD;
      value the Reveal LINQ ™ Falls Prediction System (LINQ FP) in predicting falls or identifying&#xD;
      fall risk. Participants will be recruited from recurrent fallers referred to FASU for&#xD;
      assessment. A full set of baseline assessments will be performed as necessary. Participants&#xD;
      will have a Reveal LINQ™ Device Implanted that will be updated with the Falls Prediction&#xD;
      RAMware. The Falls Prediction RAMware is programmed externally to the Reveal LINQ™, there are&#xD;
      no changes to the physical properties of the device.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be followed in the study for 12 months, with in clinic follow up&#xD;
      assessments at 3, 6, 9 and 12 months&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recurrent non-accidental fallers (n=30) over the age of 50 will be invited to participate in&#xD;
      the investigation, provided both inclusion and exclusion criteria are met. The study will&#xD;
      take place at St James's Hospital, in the Falls and Syncope Unit at MISA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical data collection, processing, and data analysis will be conducted on-site by the&#xD;
      study nurse and doctor and the on-site data manager recruited to the study team. The data&#xD;
      collected by the investigational Falls Predictor software will be transmitted via CareLink™&#xD;
      and will be processed and analysed by Medtronic.&#xD;
