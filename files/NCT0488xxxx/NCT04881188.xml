    <textblock>
      Results will show important information about potential protective factors which might be&#xD;
      relevant for the recovery of patients suffering from low back pain (theoretical basis). On a&#xD;
      clinically applied basis we plan the validation of a short screening in concerns of&#xD;
      psychosocial risk and protective factors in patients with chronic low back pain undergoing a&#xD;
      multimodal pain therapy (MPT), and this for the first time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Three main aims are: 1. Prospective validation of a short screening on a theoretical basis&#xD;
      for the collection of psychosocial risk factors concerning of an unfavourable therapeutic&#xD;
      process in MPT. 2. the verification of differences in subgroups with regard to pain&#xD;
      management on a basis of the Avoidance Endurance Model in the development of pain and&#xD;
      pain-related disability. 3. The evaluation of potential psychosocial protective factors&#xD;
      supporting a positive outcome of MPT, such as resilience, acceptance, self-compassion, and&#xD;
      body image.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Chronic low back pain (CLBP) is one of the most common causes of disease-related disabilities&#xD;
      with regard to work ability, physical activity, and mobility, as well as in the development&#xD;
      of depressive disorders and cognitive impairments. The multimodal pain therapy (MPT) is a&#xD;
      multidisciplinary offer of medical, psychlogical and physiotherapeutic treatment. Currently,&#xD;
      MPT is the best therapeutic option. However, there are still many non-responders. It is&#xD;
      unknown, which patients will benefit from MPT and which contents are the most effective.&#xD;
      Besides somatic factors, the relevance of psychosocial risk factors, such as dysfunctional&#xD;
      pain management or disstress and depression, are evident in patients suffering from CLBP.&#xD;
      Concepts, such as the Avoidance-Endurance Model of pain (AEM) describe different pattern with&#xD;
      regard of mood and pain management, offering an individual therapy. Patients with a&#xD;
      fear-avoidance response pattern (FAR) and physical inactivity as well as patients with a&#xD;
      depressive endurance response pattern (DER) and physical overactiviity show a poorer response&#xD;
      to therapeutical and rehabilitative treatments. On the other side, patients with an adaptive&#xD;
      response pattern (AR) and moderate physical activity, and patients with an eustress endurance&#xD;
      response pattern (EER) react positive to MPT. If the relevance of these pattern will be shown&#xD;
      in patients with CLBP, this would stand for a more individualised therapy concerning&#xD;
      psychological and physiotherapeutical treatment (e.g., ExposureTherapy, Pacing). Currently it&#xD;
      is unknown which factors are relevant for recovery in patients with AR. One possible&#xD;
      protective factor is the personality factor &quot;resilience&quot;. The current research situation in&#xD;
      the field of chronic pain and resilience is still in its early days and raises the question,&#xD;
      if partial aspects such as a high degree of pain acceptance, of self-compassion, and a&#xD;
      positive body image show more directly and more clearly relations to a positive response to&#xD;
      treatment. Furthermore, research has focused on cross-sectional studies. However, only&#xD;
      prospective longitudinal studies will provide insight in cause-and-effect-relationship. On a&#xD;
      clinically applied basis the diagnosis of risk and protective factors will play an&#xD;
      outstanding role to establish a more individualised therapy and rehabilitation, as also the&#xD;
      MPT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the diagnosis of the different pain pattern postulated by the AEM, the 9-item Avoidance&#xD;
      Endurance Fast-Screen (AEFS) is a reliable and valid short screening. However, it has been&#xD;
      investigated in patients with acute pain, so far. A separate validation for patients with&#xD;
      CLPB is necessary. Our working group wants to tie up the planned prospective study to&#xD;
      preliminary work and show for the first time processes of patients with CLBP undergoing MPT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On a theoretical basis results will be informative about possible protective factors being&#xD;
      important for recovery. On a clinically applied basis we plan the validation of a&#xD;
      short-screening of psychosocial risk- and protective factors in patients with CLBP undergoing&#xD;
      MPT.&#xD;
