  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Prospective, observational research study for patients with NMOSD under the care of&#xD;
      a licensed neurologist. Approximately 800 patients and 35 clinical sites in North America&#xD;
      will be recruited to participate with no defined upper limit for either target.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The objective of the registry is to create a cohort of patients with NMOSD. Data collected&#xD;
      will be used to prospectively study the natural history of NMOSD, real-word effectiveness and&#xD;
      safety of medications used to treat NMOSD, and drug utilization treatment patterns.&#xD;
      Additionally, the data will be used to systematically evaluate the burden for patients with&#xD;
      NMOSD and the impact of therapies on quality of life. This will be done through real time&#xD;
      capture and adjudication of relapses, the standardized collection of patient-reported&#xD;
      outcomes (PRO) and clinician-reported outcomes (ClinRO), the active evaluation of prevalent&#xD;
      and incident comorbidities and adverse events, and the recording of medication utilization&#xD;
      patterns.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Personal information is also collected from each consenting registry patient allowing for&#xD;
      linkages to other public or private clinical and administrative databases, as well as to&#xD;
      databases maintained by organizations focused on the care and treatment of NMOSD for the&#xD;
      purposes of clinical, market, or outcomes research. This provides an opportunity to evaluate&#xD;
      other aspects of the disease and its treatment including but not limited to clinical and drug&#xD;
      cost-effectiveness, health care resource utilization, and patient adherence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Consent for additional ad hoc surveys will be solicited which can allow evaluation of&#xD;
      additional aspects of the disease impact such as care giver burden or impact of disease on&#xD;
      productivity.&#xD;
