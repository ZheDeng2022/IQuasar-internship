  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, 4-way crossover study designed to estimate the nicotine, glycerin,&#xD;
      propylene glycol, menthol, formaldehyde, acetaldehyde, and acrolein levels in exhaled breath&#xD;
      samples during use of four MarkTen® XL e-vapor products. The study will enroll approximately&#xD;
      32 adult e-vapor-using subjects at one site in the United States in High Point, NC.&#xD;

      This is an open-label, 4-way crossover study designed to estimate the nicotine, glycerin,&#xD;
      propylene glycol, menthol, formaldehyde, acetaldehyde, and acrolein levels in exhaled breath&#xD;
      samples during use of four MarkTen® XL e-vapor products (which are no longer manufactured or&#xD;
      sold commercially). The study will enroll approximately 32 adult e-vapor-using (with no more&#xD;
      that 60% of either sex). Each of the 32 subjects will provide two exhaled breath samples (10&#xD;
      puffs for each sample) for all four test products. Subjects will make two visits to the site,&#xD;
      one screening visit and one 4 day in-clinic visit to provide exhalation samples for four test&#xD;
      products (one each day for 4 days). Subjects will also use their assigned test product ad&#xD;
      libitum for 12 hours each day after the collection of exhaled breath samples. Subjects will&#xD;
      be randomly assigned to a test product-use schedule at Visit 2, with one test product used&#xD;
      per day. The anticipated study duration for each subject from screening through completion of&#xD;
      all study participation will be approximately 34 days.&#xD;
