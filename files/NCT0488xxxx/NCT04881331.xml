  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      SurgiNose is a single-center, non-randomized feasibility study aiming to evaluate the&#xD;
      feasibility of intraoperative tissue analysis using differential mobility of surgical smoke&#xD;
      generated with electrocautery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive standard-of-care breast conserving surgery.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The increasing number of breast cancer survivors and their longevity has emphasized the&#xD;
      importance of aesthetic and functional outcomes of cancer surgery and increased pressure for&#xD;
      the surgical treatment to achieve negative margins with minimal removal of healthy tissue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Surgical smoke has been successfully utilized in tissue identification in laboratory&#xD;
      conditions by using a system based on differential mobility spectrometry (DMS) that could&#xD;
      provide a seamless margin assessment method.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, a DMS-based tissue smoke analysis system will be used intraoperatively in 20&#xD;
      breast cancer surgeries to assess its feasibility in tissue identification. The effect of the&#xD;
      system on complications and duration of surgeries is also studied. The surgeries are recorded&#xD;
      with a head-worn camera system for visual annotation of the operated tissue types to enable&#xD;
      classification of the measurement files by supervised learning.&#xD;

    <description>The device records a molecular spectrum of the surgical smoke every time the device is activated. The tissues are annotated using head-mounted camera that records video footage from the viewpoint of the surgeon.&#xD;
The primary outcome of the the study is the ability of the device to correctly classify healthy tissues that are encountered during breast surgery including fat tissue, glandular tissue, connective tissue, muscle tissue, dermis. The accuracy is cross-validated using leave-one-out cross-validation and is reported as correct classification rate (CCR) %.</description>

    <description>Patients undergo standard of care surgical removal of the malignant breast tumor. Electrosurgical knife is used to cut tissues according to standard practice. Fraction of the surgical smoke is captured for analysis and video record of the point of view of the surgeon is captured with a head-mounted camera.</description>
