    <textblock>
      This study collects information on outcomes after chimeric antigen receptor therapy and&#xD;
      radiation therapy for hematologic malignancies. Collecting information from patients before,&#xD;
      during, and after receiving chimeric antigen receptor therapy or radiation therapy may help&#xD;
      doctors to optimize patient selection, dose, timing, and sequencing of these treatments.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Record clinical outcomes of patients with hematologic malignancies receiving&#xD;
      standard-of-care chimeric antigen receptor therapy (CAR-T) and radiation therapy (RT).&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To record patient-specific factors and treatment-related factors in patients with&#xD;
      hematologic malignancies receiving standard-of-care CAR-T and RT to ultimately improve&#xD;
      patient selection and overall treatment strategy to optimize clinical outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To record and explore the relationship between radiation dose, target, technique, and&#xD;
      timing with respect to CAR-T and clinical outcomes in patients with hematologic malignancies&#xD;
      treated with standard-of-care CAR-T and RT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To record and study the relationship between patient-specific factors and&#xD;
      treatment-related factors and treatment toxicity in patients with hematologic malignancies&#xD;
      undergoing standard-of-care CAR-T and RT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients medical records are reviewed for details about CAR-T and RT treatment and acute and&#xD;
      late toxicities, disease outcomes such as any events related to local or distant disease&#xD;
      progression, survival, and cause of death if available. Patients' imaging scan data is&#xD;
      collected at baseline, within 2 months of the first treatment of RT or CAR-T, and at 3, 6, 12&#xD;
      months, and then annually for 5 years after RT completion.&#xD;
