    <textblock>
      Surgeons sometimes need to work overtime or even stay up late to perform&#xD;
      pancreaticoduodenectomy. Fatigue and sleep deprivation can result in an increased error rate&#xD;
      at work. The effect of overtime work for pancreaticoduodenectomy on the prognosis of patients&#xD;
      is unclear. The study explores the impact of overtime work for pancreaticoduodenectomy on the&#xD;
      prognosis of patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This was a single-center, retrospective study. The patients who underwent&#xD;
      pancreaticoduodenectomy in Peking University People's Hospital between 2017 and 2019 were&#xD;
      included. Patients were stratified by operative start time into the control group (surgery&#xD;
      that started between 8:00 and 16:49) and the overtime group (surgery that started between&#xD;
      17:00 and 22:00) and compared intraoperative and postoperative parameters to clarify the&#xD;
      impact of overtime surgery on the short-term prognosis of patients.&#xD;

      1. Research Background Due to the large number of operations, surgeons sometimes need to&#xD;
           work overtime to perform elective surgery. At this time, surgeons need to perform the&#xD;
           operation under fatigue or even sleep deprivation. Fatigue and sleep deprivation will&#xD;
           affect the cognitive function, leading an increased error rate at work. There have been&#xD;
           numerous studies about the effect of overtime surgery on the prognosis of patients.&#xD;
           However, the impact of surgery on patients under fatigue and sleep deprivation is still&#xD;
           controversial. Halvachizadeh et al. observed higher complication and mortality rates for&#xD;
           orthopedic trauma surgery performed after-hours. Boscà et al. believe that there is no&#xD;
           poor prognosis in patient undergoing liver transplantation by a fatigued surgeons.&#xD;
           Brunschot et al. reported that nighttime kidney transplantation is associated with less&#xD;
           pure technical graft failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Pancreaticoduodenectomy is widely used to treat pancreatic cancer, bile duct carcinoma,&#xD;
           duodenal carcinoma, and ampullary carcinoma. The operation is complicated, and usually&#xD;
           lasts more than 5 hours. Postoperative complications such as pancreatic fistula,&#xD;
           gastroparesis, abdominal infection, and abdominal hemorrhage are prone to occur.&#xD;
           Extensive literature have clarified the risk factors related to complications after&#xD;
           pancreaticoduodenectomy. At present, there is no report on the effect of&#xD;
           pancreaticoduodenectomy under overtime on the prognosis of patients. Therefore, the&#xD;
           study explores the impact of overtime work for pancreaticoduodenectomy on the prognosis&#xD;
           of patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Research method and design This study is a retrospective cohort study. The clinical data&#xD;
           of patients who underwent pancreaticoduodenectomy at the Department of Hepatobiliary&#xD;
           Surgery, Peking University People's Hospital from January 2017 to December 2019 were&#xD;
           retrospectively analyzed. The clinical data of patients are collected through the&#xD;
           medical record management system of Peking University People's Hospital; the collected&#xD;
           data includes the time of admission, age, gender, BMI, ASA classification, preoperative&#xD;
           total bilirubin level, and past concomitant diseases (hypertension, diabetes, coronary&#xD;
           heart disease, brain Vascular disease), tumor location, surgeon, operation time,&#xD;
           intraoperative blood loss, surgical reconstruction method, anastomosis method,&#xD;
           postoperative hospital stay, intra-abdominal infection, gastric emptying disorder,&#xD;
           pancreatic fistula, intraoperative death, hemorrhage, and death during hospitalization ,&#xD;
           Take the number of lymph nodes; The research data is completed by two researchers&#xD;
           independently and simultaneously. After completion, the data completed by the two are&#xD;
           compared to ensure the accuracy of the data; All patients were scheduled to undergo&#xD;
           elective surgery. Patients were stratified by operative start time into the control&#xD;
           group (surgery that started between 8:00 and 16:49) and the overtime group (surgery that&#xD;
           started between 17:00 and 22:00). The following parameters as possible confounders were&#xD;
           compared: patient age, gender, body mass index (BMI), American Society of&#xD;
           Anesthesiologists (ASA) grade, medical co-morbidities, preoperative total bilirubin,&#xD;
           site of lesion, surgeon, technique of reconstruction, techinique of&#xD;
           pancreaticojejunostomy. The following parameters between overtime group and control&#xD;
           group were compared, including operative time, blood loss, number of lymph nodes&#xD;
           removed, duration of treatment in ICU, and complication rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Sample size calculation According to the research on the incidence of pancreatic fistula&#xD;
           in pancreaticoduodenectomy, it is estimated that the incidence of pancreatic fistula in&#xD;
           the normal group is 10%, and the incidence of pancreatic fistula in the fatigue group is&#xD;
           25%. Assuming that the test type I error α is 0.05, the type II error β is 0.20, and the&#xD;
           sample size ratio of the normal group and the fatigue group is 3:1. According to the&#xD;
           sample size calculation formula, 228 cases in the normal group and 76 cases in the&#xD;
           fatigue group were obtained.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Statistical analysis Continuous variable was tested by Shapiro-Wilk test to determine&#xD;
           whether it is a normal distribution. Continuous variables that were proved to be a&#xD;
           normal distribution were reported by mean and standard deviations. Otherwise, continuous&#xD;
           variables were reported by median. Categorical variables were reported by frequency or&#xD;
           percentage. Continuous, normally distributed variables were compared with the t-test and&#xD;
           non-normally distributed variables were compared with the Mann-Whitney test. Chi-square&#xD;
           test is used to compare categorical variables. Reverse stepwise multivariable logistic&#xD;
           regression was performed to assess the effects of the potential covariates on outcome.&#xD;
           Potential confounders were selected based on a p-value less than 0.2 in univariable&#xD;
           analysis. P-values less than 0.05 were considered significant. Data was analyzed in&#xD;
           Statistical Package for the Social Sciences version 21.0 (SPSS 21.0).&#xD;
