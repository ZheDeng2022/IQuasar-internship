  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The unilateral transverse rectus abdominis musculocutaneous (TRAM) flap is a major operation&#xD;
      widely used for breast reconstruction. It is hypothesized that this surgery has the potential&#xD;
      risk of weakening the abdominal wall because it disrupts the integrity of the rectus&#xD;
      abdominis muscle (RA), therefore, alters the insertion of the oblique muscles and the&#xD;
      biomechanical relationship between the RA muscle and adjacent structures. The purposes of&#xD;
      this study were to examine the effects of the TRAM flap surgery on muscle size of abdominal&#xD;
      muscles, strength and endurance of trunk muscles, strength and endurance of core stability,&#xD;
      as well as the effects of therapeutic exercises on it in post-mastectomy women underwent TRAM&#xD;
      surgery.&#xD;

      This first year of the proposed study was aimed to understand the impacts on abdominal muscle&#xD;
      functions. We design a case-control, cross-sectional study. There were 46 women who have&#xD;
      undergone TRAM flap and 36 age-matched healthy women. We recorded the biomechanic and&#xD;
      electromyographic responses during voluntary limb movements and elicited by unexpected&#xD;
      support surface translations and tilts in standing. A six-camera Qualisys motion system was&#xD;
      used. Ground reaction forces and moments were acquired by one Kisler force plate. Surface&#xD;
      electromyography electrodes were used to record the activity of selected trunk and limb&#xD;
      muscles. The second year was aimed to evaluate the effects on abdominal muscle functions&#xD;
      after 12 weeks abdominal muscle training in the TRAM women. Outcome measures were the&#xD;
      clinical tests for trunk muscle strength, endurance and one-leg standing was also used to&#xD;
      exam the abdominal muscle function.&#xD;
