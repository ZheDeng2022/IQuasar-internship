  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The current development of hemostatic and open wound infection care strategies will focus on&#xD;
      enhancing the efficiency of hemostasis for internal bleeding, relieving pain, avoiding wound&#xD;
      infection, and promoting wound healing. As the social environment changes, the demand for&#xD;
      hemostatic techniques and wound healing is increasing. Thus, hemostatic techniques are needed&#xD;
      to be integrated with functional functions for usual trauma care, and the wound care&#xD;
      strategies that can inhibit and reduce infection while helping to facilitate wound healing&#xD;
      are needed to be developed to ensure the safety of human life. Therefore, this trial aims to&#xD;
      develop new biofiber hemostatic dressings for hemostasis and open wound care. The comparisons&#xD;
      of hemostatic and antibacterial effects, hemostatic time, wound infection status, wound&#xD;
      bacteria count, and wound adhesion situation obtained from this clinical trial are expected&#xD;
      able to establish a better rapid hemostatic strategy and wound infection care strategy.&#xD;

      This trial is performed when the subjects undergoing a cesarean section at Tri-Service&#xD;
      General Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan (R.O.C). After disinfection of the surgical wound, regular&#xD;
      gauze and chitosan dressings are directly and simultaneously placed over the disinfected&#xD;
      wound with finger pressure for 3 min, immediately after the dissection. The regular gauze&#xD;
      dressing is placed on half side of the surgical wound, while the chitosan dressing is placed&#xD;
      on another half side of the wound. After 3 min, the pressure is stopped and the doctors will&#xD;
      photograph and observe both dressings whether the bleeding has stopped. If the bleeding on&#xD;
      the surface of the wound has stopped after 20 s, the bleeding is considered to have stopped&#xD;
      and the wound is then treated according to the scheduled surgical procedure. If the bleeding&#xD;
      has not stopped, finger pressure to stop bleeding will be given for 5 min. Then, after 5&#xD;
      minutes, the pressure is stopped and the bleeding condition is observed. If the bleeding has&#xD;
      stopped after 20 s, the bleeding of the wound is judged to have stopped and the subsequent&#xD;
      surgery will be performed. However, if it still bleeds, both dressings will be replaced and&#xD;
      do the same for another 5 min. (Note) Depending on the physiological parameters of each&#xD;
      patient, the decision can be determined by the physician; if bleeding or hematoma occurs, the&#xD;
      patient will be treated according to hospital procedure until the symptoms are relieved, and&#xD;
      evaluate whether the test should be stopped.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The postoperative wound will be dressed with regular gauze and chitosan dressings and the&#xD;
      wound condition will be recorded on day 0 of the trial. The dressing is daily changed by&#xD;
      replacing regular gauze and chitosan dressings and by performing wound care. The test of the&#xD;
      dressing sample will be taken for bacterial analysis. If there are symptoms of infection&#xD;
      after 14 days of this test, the wound will be treated in accordance with the clinical routine&#xD;
      wound treatment. (Note) If the wound condition shows serious infection during the dressing&#xD;
      change process, the treatment should be carried out according to the clinical routine&#xD;
      treatment method, and it is determined and evaluated whether to stop the test. (Note) If the&#xD;
      patient's psychological stress is affected during the trial, the physician will explain and&#xD;
      determine whether the trial must be stopped.&#xD;

    <description>After 3, 5, and additional 5 minutes, consecutively depending on the patients' conditions, the use of regular gauze and chitosan dressings to compress the abdominal surgical wounds are incubated in jars containing 0.9% (w/v) saline solution for 1, 3, 5, and 10 minutes, respectively. 1 mL solution of the dressing incubation is collected and evaluated using a hemoglobin standard (H7379, Sigma-Aldrich; Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany). The hemoglobin concentration is measured by examining the optical density at 540 nm wavelength.</description>

    <description>Wound-contacted dressings of patients are collected on day 1 and day 3 postoperation and kept at 4°C within an hour processed for genomic DNA isolation using DNeasy Blood &amp; Tissue kit (QIAGEN, Germany). Amplification of 16S-rRNA-genes of distinct regions V3-V4 is conducted using specific primer 16S V3+V4: 314F-806R with the barcode. Phusion® High-Fidelity PCR Master Mix (New England Biolabs) is then used for all PCR reactions. Subsequently, 300bp paired-end raw reads are implemented for amplicon sequencing.
