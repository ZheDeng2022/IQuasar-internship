    <textblock>
      The Investigators plan a single center study to get preliminary data to answer a number of&#xD;
      fundamental questions directly related to management of COPD. The research will determine&#xD;
      whether ventilation heterogeneity and distribution of ventilation inform, determine, assist&#xD;
      or drive the: 1) status or clinical course in patients with COPD, 2) understanding of factors&#xD;
      associated with activities of daily living and quality of life in patients , 3) risk of&#xD;
      exacerbation or hospitalization in those with COPD, and 4) predictors of therapeutic pathway&#xD;
      or treatment regime.&#xD;

      The Investigators plan a single center study to get preliminary data to answer a number of&#xD;
      fundamental questions directly related to management of COPD. The research will determine&#xD;
      whether ventilation heterogeneity and distribution of ventilation inform, determine, assist&#xD;
      or drive the: 1) status or clinical course in patients with COPD, 2) understanding of factors&#xD;
      associated with activities of daily living and quality of life in patients , 3) risk of&#xD;
      exacerbation or hospitalization in those with COPD, and 4) predictors of therapeutic pathway&#xD;
      or treatment regime.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aims&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1: Determine if XV Lung Ventilation Analysis Software yields valid and clinically useful&#xD;
      quantification of ventilation in COPD subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goal of aim 1 is to develop the practical and technical components to deploy XF&#xD;
      functional lung imaging within the institution in collaboration with, pulmonary and&#xD;
      radiology, infrastructure from information technology and administration. After initial&#xD;
      testing, LVAS will be deployed in the institution for the study and validated against data&#xD;
      from 4DMedical.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2: Determine if XV Lung Ventilation Analysis Software provides enhanced clinical&#xD;
      assessment of lung function as compared to standard spirometry, SGRQ, COPD assessment test&#xD;
      (CAT), Borg dyspnea score, mMRC questionnaire, 6MWT, and recent-CT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In aim 2, the Investigators will take patients presenting to our outpatient clinics or&#xD;
      recently discharged from the hospital with presence of COPD in spirometry and approach them&#xD;
      for consenting for the study. After informed consent Investigators will collect baseline&#xD;
      demographic data, study questionnaires and assess functional capacity using 6MWT and perform&#xD;
      a noncontrast CT chest if not performed previously and perform fluoroscopy to get data for&#xD;
      4DXV lung imaging. Patients will continue with their usual pharmacological therapies and&#xD;
      exercise program. These data points will be repeated between 4-8 weeks and 10-14 weeks to get&#xD;
      very short-term (4-8 weeks) and short-term (10-14 weeks) changes in clinical assessment,&#xD;
      spirometry and 4DXV lung imaging.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 3: Determine the sample size for effect for future studies in COPD patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In aim 3, investigators will analyze data generated in aim 2 to determine if there are very&#xD;
      short and short-term changes in spatial distribution of lung ventilation with changes in&#xD;
      patient's clinical condition as determined by clinical assessment and spirometry to determine&#xD;
      if the 4DXV technology can be used to study and understand progression of COPD in patients&#xD;
      with mild to moderate disease. Data generated with the used to analyze the sample size&#xD;
      necessary to perform a multicenter study incorporating the use of 4DXV technology in the&#xD;
      management of patients with mild-moderate COPD and to determine what data points from the&#xD;
      4DXV technology can be used in clinical trials of COPD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each aim of the proposal will generate several products for clinical and research audiences&#xD;
      to better understand and develop the use of 4DXV technology. The Investigators plan to&#xD;
      develop two products using this results of the study:&#xD;
