  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The research aims to elucidate a specially-designed personalized diet that will increase gut&#xD;
      colonization of Prevotella sp. and butyrate levels in pregnant mothers and the benefits in&#xD;
      reducing infant's food allergy development.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      After being informed about the study and potential risk, all patients giving written informed&#xD;
      consent will go one week screening period to assess for study eligibility prior to&#xD;
      enrollment. At week 0, single-blind randomization (subject and health care providers except&#xD;
      for principal investigator) will be conducted and participant will be randomized into two&#xD;
      groups namely; the control group and the intervention group. The control group will receive&#xD;
      standard dietary counselling on a healthy pregnancy diet. Meanwhile, the intervention group&#xD;
      will receive dietary intervention which is tailored to the study objective to increase&#xD;
      targeted bacteria of Prevotella sp and the short-chain fatty acids namely butyrate. The trial&#xD;
      will be in 20 weeks duration during pregnancy and additional 12-months follow up for the&#xD;
      delivered infants.&#xD;
