  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study was to quantify the effect of moderate and severe orthodontic&#xD;
      forces on Calcitonin gene-related peptide expression in the healthy human periodontal&#xD;
      ligament.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology: 90 human periodontal ligament samples were obtained from healthy premolars where&#xD;
      extraction was indicated for orthodontic reasons. Prior to extraction, teeth were divided&#xD;
      into 3 groups of 30 samples each: I) Untreated teeth control group; II) Moderate force group:&#xD;
      A 56 g force was applied to the premolars for 7 days; and III) Severe force group: A 224 g&#xD;
      force was applied to the premolars for 24 hours. All periodontal ligament samples were&#xD;
      processed and CGRP was measured by radioimmunoassay.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      An experimental study was performed according to Colombian Ministry of Health recommendations&#xD;
      regarding ethical issues in research involving human tissue. Written informed consent was&#xD;
      obtained from each of the patients participating in the study (18-27 years old, healthy, not&#xD;
      medicated, and nonsmoking human donors, with premolars extraction indicated for orthodontic&#xD;
      reasons). All teeth used were caries- and restoration-free with complete root development&#xD;
      determined radiographically (and confirmed visually after extraction), without signs of&#xD;
      periodontal disease or traumatic occlusion, and without previous orthodontic forces.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experimental procedure Periodontal ligament samples were obtained from 90 premolars that were&#xD;
      randomly divided into 3 groups of 30 premolars each, as follows: I) Untreated teeth control&#xD;
      group (without orthodontic forces); II) Moderate force group; III) Severe force group. Teeth&#xD;
      in moderate and severe orthodontic force groups were submitted to tipping and extrusion&#xD;
      orthodontic movements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Orthodontic forces were applied following the exact same methodology that was used in a&#xD;
      previous study (15), in which, prior to orthodontic force application, the occlusal surface&#xD;
      of the first mandibular molar was raised with a block of resin (Filtek Z350, 3M Espe,&#xD;
      Seefeld, Germany) until the premolars were out of occlusion. A convertible standard buccal&#xD;
      tube (Orthorganizer, Carlsbad, CA) was bonded over the buccal face of the first molar with&#xD;
      resin (Light Bond, Reliance Orthodontic Products Inc, Itasca, IL). An MBT slot size 0.022&#xD;
      bracket (Ref. 702-393 MC, Orthorganizer) was bonded over the buccal face of the premolars.&#xD;
      One 0.0017 x 0.025 in titanium molybdenum alloy (TMA) wire cantilever was inserted into each&#xD;
      first molar tube and the wire was bent buccally to form a helix.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The cantilever was clinched to the distal end of the tube and exerted a tipping and extrusive&#xD;
      force on the premolar. For the teeth in the moderate force group, the activation angle was&#xD;
      45º with a force of 56 g. For the severe force group, the activation angle was 90º with a&#xD;
      force of 224 g. For both groups, forces were measured with an orthodontic dynamometer. Once&#xD;
      the force was measured, the free-end of the sectional arch was hooked to the bracket with a&#xD;
      metallic ligature. Seven days after, the ligature, the sectional arch, the tube, and the&#xD;
      resin block were removed in order to perform the extraction procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All teeth were anesthetized with 1.8 mL 4% prilocaine without vasoconstrictor by infiltrative&#xD;
      injection for upper premolars and inferior alveolar nerve block injection for lower&#xD;
      premolars. Adequate pulpal anesthesia was ascertained with a negative response to an&#xD;
      electronic pulp vitality test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample collection Teeth in the control and orthodontic forces group were extracted 10 min&#xD;
      after anesthetic application with conventional methods and without excessive injury to the&#xD;
      periodontal ligament. Immediately after extraction, PDL samples were obtained from the entire&#xD;
      length of the root with a periodontal curette, placed on an Eppendorf tube, snap-frozen in&#xD;
      liquid nitrogen, and kept at -70°C until use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Radioimmunoassay (RIA) PDL samples were defrosted without thermal shock, dried on a filter,&#xD;
      and individually weighed on an analytical balance. Neuropeptide was extracted by adding 150&#xD;
      µL of 0.5 mol L-1 acetic acid and double boiling in a thermostat bath for 30 min in&#xD;
      accordance with previously reported protocols (9,12,15,18-21).&#xD;
&#xD;
      CGRP expression was determined by competition binding assays using a human CGRP-RIA kit from&#xD;
      Phoenix Peptide Pharmaceutical (Ref. RK-015-02, Belmont, CA). Fifty µL of each sample&#xD;
      solution were incubated in polypropylene tubes at room temperature for 20 h with 100 µL of&#xD;
      primary antibody and 100 µL of different CGRP concentrations (10 pg mL-1 -1280 pg mL-1).&#xD;
      Then, 50 µL of 125I-CGRP was added and left incubate for another 24 h. Bound fractions were&#xD;
      precipitated by the addition of 100 µL of a secondary antibody (Goat Anti- Rabbit IgG serum),&#xD;
      100 µL of normal rabbit serum, and 500 µL of RIA buffer containing 1% polyethylene glycol&#xD;
      4000. After 2 h of incubation at room temperature, tubes were spun at 3000 rpm for 45 min at&#xD;
      4º C. The supernatants were decanted, and pellet radioactivity was read on a Gamma Counter&#xD;
      (Gamma Assay LS 5500; Beckman, Fullerton, CA). Standard curves of authentic peptide were made&#xD;
      in buffers identical to the tissue extracts on semi-log graph paper.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Finally, analysis of the binding data assessed the amount of CGRP present in every sample,&#xD;
      using the percentage of maximum binding (B/B0%) calculated for each unknown sample, reading&#xD;
      across the graph to the point of intersection with the calibration curve, where the&#xD;
      corresponding X-axis coordinate is equivalent to the concentration of peptide in the assayed&#xD;
      sample.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis Values are presented as CGRP concentration in pmol per mg of PDL. Mean,&#xD;
      standard deviation, medians, and maximum/minimum values are presented for each group. Kruskal&#xD;
      Wallis test was performed to establish statistically significant differences between groups&#xD;
      (P&lt;0.05). LSD posthoc comparisons were also performed.&#xD;
