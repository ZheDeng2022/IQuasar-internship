      Background: Electrosurgery is used in almost all surgeries. The entire surgical team working&#xD;
      in these operating rooms is exposed to surgical smoke. In the literature, there is no study&#xD;
      examining the direct effect of surgical smoke on operating room staff and involving the&#xD;
      entire surgical team in sampling.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Materials and Methods: This experimental-type study was conducted in the operating room of&#xD;
      the Department of General Surgery of a University Hospital. In the study, the surgeries were&#xD;
      completed with standard practice and four different protective measures that could affect&#xD;
      surgical smoke exposure. Blood and urine samples were collected from the surgical team before&#xD;
      and after the surgery. Consequently, 70 blood and 70 urine samples were collected. The&#xD;
      Wilcoxon signed-rank test was used to compare pre- and post-operative analyses.&#xD;

      2. MATERIALS AND METHODS 2.1 Design of the Study This was an experimental study. 2.2&#xD;
      Population and Sample of the Study Pre- and post-operative blood and urine samples of the&#xD;
      surgical team (surgeon, surgical resident, anaesthesiologist, scrub nurse, circulating nurse,&#xD;
      support staff and researcher), who worked in the standard practice, and the use of four&#xD;
      different preventive measures that may affect the surgical smoke exposure during total&#xD;
      mastectomy surgery in the operating room of the General Surgery Department of a University&#xD;
      Hospital between January 2019 and December 2019 created the sample of the study. During the&#xD;
      study process, the surgeon, scrub nurse, circulating nurse and researcher were ensured to be&#xD;
      the same people in each surgery. The surgical resident, anaesthesiologist, anaesthesia&#xD;
      technician and support staff included in the study did not consist of the same people due to&#xD;
      the change in the work schedules. Blood and urine samples were collected from a team of seven&#xD;
      people before and after surgery [7 volunteers × 2 (blood and urine before and after surgery)&#xD;
      = 14 (14 blood analysis + 14 urine analysis) 14 × 5 surgery = 70 (70 blood analysis + 70&#xD;
      urine analysis)].&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.3 Collection of Study Data 2.3.1 Data Collection Tools The Surgery Data Collection Form,&#xD;
      which was created by the researchers in line with the relevant literature (Romano et al.&#xD;
      2016, 2017, Ragde et al. 2014; Tseng et al. 2014, Lin et al. 2010, Hollmann et al. 2004) to&#xD;
      evaluate the information about the surgery, was used to collect the data. Other data&#xD;
      collection tools were the N95 and safety equipment, the RapidVac™ Smoke Evacuator system for&#xD;
      smoke evacuation, as well as the pencil type (smoke extractor) and smoke tubing evacuators.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.3.2 Data Collection Method Blood and urine samples of the surgical team were collected&#xD;
      before the total mastectomy in five different situations listed below that may affect&#xD;
      surgical smoke exposure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the surgery is completed with routine applications (without taking any measures for&#xD;
      smoke evacuation), After completing the surgery with the use of special safety equipment (N95&#xD;
      mask, safety glasses and without any measures for smoke evacuation), After the evacuation of&#xD;
      the smoke caused by the surgery with a wall-mounted aspirator, After the evacuation of the&#xD;
      smoke caused by the surgery with a smoke tubing and After the evacuation of the smoke caused&#xD;
      by the surgery with a smoke evacuation pencil.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The blood samples were kept in a transport bag that maintained the temperature range between&#xD;
      2 and 4 °C until they reached the laboratory and kept at -20 °C for analysis. Blood samples&#xD;
      were evaluated in the laboratory for benzene, toluene, xylene and styrene.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Similarly, the urine samples were kept in a transport bag that maintained the temperature&#xD;
      range between 2 and 4 °C until they reached the laboratory and kept at -20 °C for analysis.&#xD;
      The urine samples were evaluated in terms of urinary metabolites benzene-phenol-TT muconic&#xD;
      acid, toluene-hippuric acid-O, cresol, xylene-hippuric acid and phenol-phenol in the&#xD;
      laboratory.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood and urine analysis in the study was performed by the Central Research Test and Analysis&#xD;
      Laboratory Application and Research Center of the university of this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.3.3 Evaluation and Analysis of Data The study data was evaluated using the IBM SPSS&#xD;
      Statistics 25.0 Statistics program. The Wilcoxon signed-rank test was used to compare pre-&#xD;
      and post-operative analyses. Moreover, 0.05 was accepted as significant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Gas chromatography/mass spectrometry was used for the analysis of blood and urine samples of&#xD;
      the surgical team.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.4 Ethical Aspect of Study Permission (11.01.2018-E.11195) was obtained from the Clinical&#xD;
      Research Ethics Committee of the university of this study. Also, written permission&#xD;
      (29.01.2018-E27595) from the institution where the research was conducted as well as informed&#xD;
      written consent from the participants in the study were obtained.&#xD;
