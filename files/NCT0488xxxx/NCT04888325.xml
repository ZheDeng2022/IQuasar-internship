  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Energy regulation in humans is controlled through complicated mechanisms involving among&#xD;
      others hormones secreted from different tissues, such as gut, muscle and adipose tissue.&#xD;
      Specifically, the hormonal secretion after nutrient intake mediates the metabolic response in&#xD;
      order to maintain energy balance. Proglucagon-derived hormones and especially GLP-1 and&#xD;
      glucagon are significantly affected by nutrient intake and by energy balance. Despite the&#xD;
      extensive information about GLP-1 and glucagon, it remains unclear whether other&#xD;
      proglucagon-derived hormones are regulated by nutrition or by energy status i.e. obesity or&#xD;
      type 2 diabetes. Similarly, secretion of activins and follistatins, which are both affecting&#xD;
      muscle metabolism-growth and consequently energy homeostasis, are reduced in energy&#xD;
      deprivation states. However, we do not know whether the circulating profile of these hormones&#xD;
      is affected acutely by nutrient intake and whether these changes have acute effects on muscle&#xD;
      metabolism.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We propose to conduct a non-blinded interventional study evaluating the effects of oral or&#xD;
      intravenous glucose intake in the circulating levels of proglucagon-derived hormones, activin&#xD;
      A, activin B, follistatin, follistatin-like 3.&#xD;

      Screening Visit: Potential subjects will present for a study screening visit in the study&#xD;
      site. A written informed consent will be obtained by a study physician at the screening&#xD;
      visit. Potential subjects will have their medical history obtained and will be examined by a&#xD;
      study physician. Vitals will be taken and height, weight, and waist circumference will be&#xD;
      measured. Potential subjects will have a screening fingerstick glucose test as a marker of&#xD;
      diabetes and blood collected for CBC and basic lipid panel. Menstrual status will be assessed&#xD;
      by menstrual history (female subjects only) and women will take a urine pregnancy test and&#xD;
      will be excluded from participation if pregnant. Subjects will meet with a registered&#xD;
      dietitian.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 1: Subjects will return to the GCRC after a 10-hour overnight fast. In the study site,&#xD;
      subjects will have vital signs and anthropometrics measured. All subjects will have one IV&#xD;
      line, used to obtain blood samples for insulin, glucose, proglucagon derived hormones and&#xD;
      muscle-acting hormones (activin A, activin B, follistatin, follistatin-like 3).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will consume orally glucose 1.25 grams/kg in 200 ml water at time 0 and the same&#xD;
      amount again at 3 hours. During the 6-hour period they are also going to receive normal&#xD;
      saline (NaCL 0,9%) at a rate of 0.83 plus Heparin, 800 IU/h with a priming dose of 1000 IU.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood collection will be obtained from the IV line at 30 min intervals for the first 2 hrs&#xD;
      and hourly thereafter.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 2: Subjects will return after a 10-hour overnight visit. Visit 2 will be performed at&#xD;
      least 1 week after Visit 1. All subjects will have two IV lines, one for obtaining blood&#xD;
      samples for insulin, glucose, proglucagon derived hormones and muscle-acting hormones&#xD;
      (activin A, activin B, follistatin, follistatin-like 3) and another one for the intravenous&#xD;
      administration of glucose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specifically a 10% intravenous glucose infusion at a rate of 3.6 ml/kg/h plus Heparin 800&#xD;
      IU/h with a priming dose of 1000 IU will be administrated for 6 hours. At time 0 and at 3&#xD;
      hours they will drink 300 ml water to control for any effects of gastric distension.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood collection will be obtained from the IV line at 30 min intervals for the first 2 hrs&#xD;
      and hourly thereafter.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each blood draw will be 15 ml (5 ml in EDTA tubes with aprotinin and 10 ml in serum tubes).&#xD;
