      A multi-centre phase II trial of GvHD prophylaxis following unrelated donor stem cell&#xD;
      transplantation comparing Thymoglobulin vs. Calcineurin inhibitor or Sirolimus-based&#xD;
      post-transplant cyclophosphamide.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, phase II, adaptive, multicentre, randomised clinical trial in patients&#xD;
      undergoing reduced intensity conditioned (RIC) unrelated donor allogeneic stem cell&#xD;
      transplantation (allo-SCT). The trial will compare the novel graft-versus-host disease (GvHD)&#xD;
      prophylaxis regimens of post-transplant cyclophosphamide (PTCy) + Calcineurin inhibitor (CNI)&#xD;
      (PTCy-CNI) or PTCy + Sirolimus to a current standard-of-care involving the use of T-cell&#xD;
      depletion with Thymoglobulin. Patients will be minimised at randomisation by their&#xD;
      randomising centre, disease risk score (low/intermediate or high/very high) and human&#xD;
      leukocyte antigen (HLA) match (10/10 or 9/10). Patients eligible for entry into the trial&#xD;
      will be randomised on a 1:1:1 ratio to receive either one of the experimental treatment arms&#xD;
      or the control arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective is to compare GvHD-free, relapse-free Survival (GRFS) in patients&#xD;
      treated with the GvHD prophylaxis regimens PTCy-CNI, PTCy-Sirolimus or T-cell depletion with&#xD;
      Thymoglobulin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objectives are to evaluate the cumulative incidence of acute GvHD (aGvHD), the&#xD;
      cumulative incidence of moderate and severe chronic GvHD (cGvHD), the cumulative incidence of&#xD;
      non-relapse mortality (NRM), overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), immune&#xD;
      suppression-free survival, the cumulative incidence of engraftment, the incidence of full&#xD;
      donor chimerism, the cumulative incidence of infection requiring inpatient admission, the&#xD;
      number of inpatient days, the timing and dose of donor lymphocyte infusion (DLI), the&#xD;
      cumulative incidence of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) related-post transplant lymphoproliferative&#xD;
      disease (PTLD), the number of doses rituximab administered for EBV reactivation, quality of&#xD;
      life (QoL), the cumulative incidence of haemorrhagic cystitis, the cumulative incidence of&#xD;
      cytomegalovirus (CMV) viraemia and CMV end-organ disease and safety and tolerability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The scientific research will address the questions about how plasma biomarkers for GvHD&#xD;
      predict GvHD and non-relapse mortality following T-cell depleted methods of transplantation&#xD;
      and how the different methods of T-cell depletion impact on immune function and&#xD;
      re-constitution.&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
        1. Do plasma biomarkers for GvHD predict GvHD and non-relapse mortality following T-cell&#xD;
           depleted methods of transplantation?&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Do PTCy methods increase T cell receptor repertoire diversity (as measured by TCR DNA&#xD;
           sequencing) compared to ATG-based T cell depletion?&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. How do the different methods of T-cell depletion impact upon donor Treg reconstitution?&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. How do the different methods of T-cell depletion impact upon thymic function as&#xD;
           evaluated by measurement of recent thymic emigrants?&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Are PTCy methods of TCD associated with better preservation of virus-specific immunity&#xD;
           (as measured by tetramer or ex vivo functional immune responses)?&#xD;

    <description>Thymoglobulin is given as an intravenous infusion of 2.5 mg/kg/day over 2 days (days -2 and -1; total dose 5 mg/kg) via a central line through a 0.2 micron inline filter. Each dose will be infused over 6-8 hours. No test dose will be given. 30 minutes before Thymoglobulin, the patient should receive methylprednisolone 1mg/kg intravenously, 1g paracetamol PO and 10mg chlorphenamine IV. Patients should be monitored carefully and receive appropriate therapy for any infusion-related or anaphylactic reactions as per local policy.&#xD;
Patients will receive IV/PO cyclosporine according to local policy to begin on day -1 maintaining a trough level of 100-200 µg/L until day 90 before a subsequent taper in the absence of any active GvHD.&#xD;
MMF will be given IV/PO according to local policy at a dose of 1g TDS to begin on day -1 and discontinued on day 35 without taper if there is no evidence of active GvHD. In adults weighing &lt;55kg, MMF should be given at a lower dose of 0.75g IV/PO TDS.</description>

    <description>Cyclophosphamide is given as an IV infusion of 50 mg/kg/day over 2 days (days 3 and 4; total dose 100 mg/kg) together with IV hydration and Mesna, as per local policy.&#xD;
Patients will receive IV/PO cyclosporine according to local policy to begin on day 5 maintaining a trough level of 100-200 µg/L until day 90 before a subsequent taper in the absence of active GvHD.&#xD;
MMF will be given IV/PO according to local policy at a dose of 1g TDS to begin on day 5 and discontinued on day 35 without taper if there is no evidence of active GvHD. In adults weighing &lt;55kg, MMF should be given at a lower dose of 0.75g IV/PO TDS.</description>

    <description>Cyclophosphamide is given as an IV infusion of 50 mg/kg/day over 2 days (days 3 and 4; total dose 100 mg/kg) together with IV hydration and Mesna, as per local policy.&#xD;
Sirolimus will be initially given PO as a loading dose of 6 mg on day 5 followed by 2 mg daily; doses will be adjusted to maintain a trough level (in whole blood) of 8 to 14 ng/mL until day 60, thereafter 5-8 ng/mL until day 90. In the absence of active GvHD, the dose of sirolimus will be tapered from day 90. We recommend that the daily maintenance dose of sirolimus is reduced empirically to 0.5-1mg daily with concomitant treatment with a triazole anti-fungal agent.&#xD;
MMF will be given IV/O according to local policy at a dose of 1g TDS to begin on day 5 and discontinued on day 35 without taper if there is no evidence of active GvHD. In adults weighing &lt;55kg, MMF should be given at a lower dose of 0.75g IV/PO TDS.</description>
