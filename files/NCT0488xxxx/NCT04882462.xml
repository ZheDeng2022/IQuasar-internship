    <textblock>
      This clinical study is designed as a prospective, open-label, single arm, multicenter study&#xD;
      to evaluate the clinical efficacy and safety of Sintilimab and Nimotuzumab in combination&#xD;
      with chemotherapy in patients with newly diagnosed recurrent/metastatic head and neck&#xD;
      squamous cell carcinoma (R/M HNSCC). The main endpoint is progression free survival (PFS);&#xD;
      the secondary endpoint are objective response rate (ORR), disease control rate (DCR), overall&#xD;
      survival (OS) and safety.&#xD;
