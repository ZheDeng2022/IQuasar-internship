  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to test how a medication called nabilone (Cesamet)&#xD;
      affects neurocognitive processes involved in obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), including&#xD;
      threat response, processing of fear signals, and habitual behavior. OCD is a disabling&#xD;
      illness that affects around 2% of the population and involves recurrent intrusive thoughts&#xD;
      (obsessions) and repetitive behaviors (compulsions) that lead to distress and/or impaired&#xD;
      functioning. Nabilone is a synthetic form of delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC, the primary&#xD;
      psychoactive component of the cannabis plant). It acts on the brain's endocannabinoid system,&#xD;
      which has been hypothesized to play a role in OCD symptoms. Nabilone is approved by the FDA&#xD;
      for the treatment of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting. It is not FDA-approved for&#xD;
      treating OCD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, 60 adults with OCD will receive a single dose of either nabilone or placebo.&#xD;
      Participants will then complete a series of assessments including neuroimaging,&#xD;
      psychophysiology (e.g., skin conductance recording), computerized behavioral tasks, and&#xD;
      self-report measures. The information gained from this study could contribute to the&#xD;
      development of new treatments for people with OCD and related disorders.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The total time required for each participant is 4 visits, as outlined below:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 1: Screening, Questionnaires, and Orientation: During this visit potential participants&#xD;
      will learn about the study procedures, sign the informed consent documents, complete&#xD;
      diagnostic evaluations and medical screening with study staff. Participants will also&#xD;
      complete a series of forms that ask about demographic information, OCD symptoms, use of drugs&#xD;
      and alcohol, and other aspects of physical and mental health.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 2: Behavioral Tests: During this visit participants will complete several computer&#xD;
      tasks. Study staff will measure reaction time and obtain psychophysiological information&#xD;
      (e.g., skin conductance recordings). The tasks that the participant completes will involve&#xD;
      viewing images within a virtual environment. An aversive stimulus (e.g., loud burst of noise,&#xD;
      animated snake) may follow one image most of the time, while other images may never be&#xD;
      followed by a noise or a snake. The participant will need to try to predict whether the&#xD;
      aversive cue will occur or not based on which image is shown, and will be asked to repeatedly&#xD;
      rate on a scale how likely they think it is that a noise/snake will occur after each image.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 3: Behavioral Tests with Drug or Placebo and MRI scan: For safety reasons, participants&#xD;
      will be asked not to take any drugs for at least 24 hours before this visit. They will also&#xD;
      be asked not to use marijuana/cannabis for at least 2 weeks before participating.&#xD;
      Participants will be required to test negative on a urine drug screen and breathalyzer before&#xD;
      continuing with this visit; women must also have a negative pregnancy test. Participants will&#xD;
      need to complete a field sobriety test at the end of this visit and will be asked not to&#xD;
      drive or operate machinery for the following 24 hours; participants not traveling to the&#xD;
      clinic by subway or taxi should arrange to have a friend or family member pick them up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two hours before beginning the Visit 3 tasks, participants will be asked to swallow a capsule&#xD;
      containing either nabilone or placebo (sugar pill). Nabilone is a Food &amp; Drug Administration&#xD;
      (FDA) approved medication, and the dose (1mg, one time) is unlikely to have any effects that&#xD;
      last beyond the duration of the study visit. About every 30 minutes after taking the pill,&#xD;
      the participant will fill out some questionnaires asking about how they are feeling at the&#xD;
      moment. At the end of the session, they will also be asked to guess whether they received&#xD;
      nabilone or placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will then complete a task that is similar to the one on the previous day (Visit&#xD;
      2), but will be completed in the MRI scanner. During the MRI scan, participants will view the&#xD;
      same images as on the previous day (Visit 2), and may experience the same aversive stimulus&#xD;
      as during Visit 2. They will again be asked to rate how much they expect to experience the&#xD;
      aversive stimulus after each image and to self-report their level of anxiety on a scale from&#xD;
      0 to 100. Finally, they will be asked to relax with their eyes open while viewing a white&#xD;
      fixation cross on a back background.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will complete an additional task outside of the MRI scanner. Participants will&#xD;
      be repeatedly asked to view and choose between different images (e.g., spaceships), which&#xD;
      lead to a different set of images. They must select one image from this second set, with some&#xD;
      choices leading to a small monetary reward.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 4: Behavioral Tests and MRI scan: This visit will be very similar to Visit 3, except&#xD;
      that participants will not receive any study medication. Participants will complete the same&#xD;
      type of task inside the MRI scanner, while the study staff measures reaction time,&#xD;
      psychophysiological response, and brain activation. Participants will view the same images as&#xD;
      in Visits 2 and 3, and may experience the same aversive stimulus. Participants will again be&#xD;
      asked to rate how much they expect to experience the aversive stimulus after each image and&#xD;
      to report their level of anxiety on a scale from 0 to 100. Participants will again be asked&#xD;
      to relax with their eyes open while viewing a white fixation cross on a black background.&#xD;
      Finally, outside of the scanner, participants will complete another decision-making task&#xD;
      similar to the one they completed the day before.&#xD;
