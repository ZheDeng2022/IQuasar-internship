  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      360 million people worldwide suffer from disabling hearing loss. The prevalence of hearing&#xD;
      impairment, all stages combined, in the French population is 7% (4 million people), of which&#xD;
      9% have severe impairment and 3% have profound or total impairment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cochlear implants are indicated in severe to profound deafness in some cases. The principle&#xD;
      of the cochlear implant is to directly stimulate the fibres of the auditory nerve via&#xD;
      electrodes inserted into the cochlea. It stimulates the auditory nerve and sends electrical&#xD;
      impulses to the brain where they are interpreted as sounds.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The steps in hearing rehabilitation are surgical placement of the cochlear implant,&#xD;
      activation, and follow-up adjustments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is no formal consensus on the exact adjustment procedures during activation or&#xD;
      follow-up, but principles are followed depending on the cochlear implant adjustment centers&#xD;
      (jack). All centers focus on sound intensity adjustments to achieve the goals of tonal&#xD;
      audiometry in open-field silence with cochlear implant alone between 20 and 40 db (30 db most&#xD;
      frequently). However, it is common practice to observe that this means of assessment does not&#xD;
      really represent the performance of the individual because hearing a sound does not mean that&#xD;
      someone will be able to recognize it and interpret it. Some of the patients who achieve these&#xD;
      goals have difficulty hearing well in a noisy environment. Speech audiometry in silence and&#xD;
      especially in noise would be a better reflection of patient needs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bimodal hearing is having a cochlear implant and a contralateral hearing aid. In cochlear&#xD;
      implants, having bimodal binaural hearing improves the patients ability to understand speech&#xD;
      in silent and noisy contexts. It should thus be considered when a second cochlear implant is&#xD;
      not indicated in the contralateral ear.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It has been shown that intelligibility and musical perception are altered when the frequency&#xD;
      allocations are different from the manufacturer's default frequency allocations. The possible&#xD;
      redundancy between the acoustic and electrical information on the contralateral ear can lead&#xD;
      to metallic distortion of the voice, which is perceived as less natural. This is due to a&#xD;
      different stimulation of the cochlear tonotopic zones concerning conversational frequencies,&#xD;
      between the implanted side and the device side. However, the frequency distribution is not&#xD;
      subject to adjustment in current practice. A modification of the frequency distribution is&#xD;
      possible on cochlear implants, which could improve the intelligibility and comfort of the&#xD;
      implanted patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This working hypothesis will be studied, and a simple protocol for frequency reallocation of&#xD;
      the cochlear implant will be developed to optimize the daily hearing performance of the&#xD;
      implanted patients. An evolutionary algorithm will be used. The search for new adjustment&#xD;
      solutions will be carried out within the safety limits imposed by the adjusters (detection&#xD;
      and comfort loudness threshold).&#xD;
