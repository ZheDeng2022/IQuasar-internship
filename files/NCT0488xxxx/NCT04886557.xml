      The Dynesys dynamic stabilization (DDS) system is considered a motion-preserving device.&#xD;
      However, studies addressing the change in the range of motion (ROM) are limited. Therefore,&#xD;
      this study aimed to investigate the factors influencing ROM change at the index surgical&#xD;
      level, supra-index level, and whole lumbar spine, in addition to the association between ROM&#xD;
      preservation and the incidence of screw-loosening.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Decompression with instrumented fusion is an effective surgical intervention for lumbar&#xD;
      degenerative spondylolisthesis with spinal stenosis. However, the range of motion (ROM)&#xD;
      decreased at the index surgical level may lead to an increased ROM at the non-surgical level,&#xD;
      increase biomechanical stress at the transitional adjacent segment, and lead to adjacent&#xD;
      segment degeneration (ASD) .&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Dynesys dynamic stabilization (DDS) system is a pedicle screw-based, motion-preserving,&#xD;
      and non-fusion stabilization developed as an alternative to the rigid instrumented fusion for&#xD;
      degenerative spondylolisthesis. The aim of the DDS is to maintain segmental motion at index&#xD;
      levels and to reduce the incidence of ASD. However, the actual impact of ROM has remained&#xD;
      elusive. Prior studies have reported an average ROM loss of 1.1ยบ to 17.3ยบ 7 at index surgical&#xD;
      level at an average of 24 months follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The change of ROM at index surgical, supra-index, and whole lumbar spine following DDS&#xD;
      remains unclear. This study aims to investigate the factors influencing the ROM change at&#xD;
      index surgical level, supra-index level, and whole lumbar spine, and the association between&#xD;
      ROM preservation and the incidence of screw-loosening.&#xD;

    <description>Adult patients with degenerative spondylolisthesis over L4-L5 received DDS with a minimum of 2-year follow-up were reviewed. Surgical indications were patients who failed to respond to conservative treatment for at least 6 months. The exclusion criteria were: (1) presence of degenerative scoliosis or spinal deformity, (2) prior spine surgery, (3) lost to follow-up, or (4) failure to complete the questionnaires or radiographic examinations.</description>

    <intervention_name>L4-L5 decompression and dynamic instrumentation</intervention_name>
    <description>All surgeries were performed by a senior surgeon using a traditional midline approach. Stability-preserving lumbar decompression with facet joint undercutting was performed to preserve the facet joints as much as possible. In cases of severe stenosis, a bilateral partial facetectomy (&lt; 25%) was performed for adequate decompression. Posterior tension of the supra- and inter-spinous ligaments was preserved at the most cranial level. Patients were encouraged to ambulate after drain removal and wear a soft lumbar orthosis for at least 3 months after the operation.</description>
