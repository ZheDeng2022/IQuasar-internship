    <textblock>
      Patient will be treated with neratinib, an aromatase inhibitor and trastuzumab for 24 weeks&#xD;
      prior to surgery, following an initial 3 weeks of neratinib alone, aromatase inhibitor alone&#xD;
      or the combination of neratinib and an aromatase inhibitor. A breast biopsy will be performed&#xD;
      at 3 weeks. Following surgery, patients will receive standard of care HER2-directed and&#xD;
      endocrine therapy at the treating physician's discretion.&#xD;
