  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Acute heart failure is a common reason for emergency department visits and hospitalization,&#xD;
      but the diagnosis can be challenging because of non-specific symptoms and signs. The current&#xD;
      diagnostic approach to acute heart failure has modest accuracy, leading to delayed diagnosis&#xD;
      and treatment, which associate with worse prognosis. Prior work suggests diagnostic accuracy&#xD;
      can be improved with the addition of multiple circulating biomarkers discovered through&#xD;
      proteomics, and this study will derive and validate a multi-marker model to improve&#xD;
      diagnostic accuracy for acute heart failure in the emergency department.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Acute heart failure (HF) is highly morbid, lethal, and costly. It is a difficult diagnosis to&#xD;
      make given its symptoms and signs overlap with other cardiac and non-cardiac conditions. In&#xD;
      the emergency department (ED), misdiagnosis of acute HF is common and associated with adverse&#xD;
      outcomes. Biomarker testing can facilitate accurate diagnosis; however, natriuretic peptides&#xD;
      (NP) are the only guideline recommend biomarker of HF for diagnostic testing, and are better&#xD;
      for ruling-out, rather than ruling-in, acute HF. Even with NP testing, in contemporary&#xD;
      clinical practice misdiagnosis of acute HF still occurs in 10 to 45% of patients presenting&#xD;
      to the ED with dyspnea. Clinical prediction models including multiple biomarkers hold promise&#xD;
      for improving diagnostic accuracy. The few prior studies investigating a multiple biomarker&#xD;
      approach for diagnosing acute HF were limited by constraint to highly correlated markers from&#xD;
      known biologic pathways, relatively small sample sizes, lack of inclusion of all a priori&#xD;
      selected biomarkers into a single model, and absence of validation cohorts. The current study&#xD;
      is designed to address these limitations. Recent advances in &quot;omics&quot; enable novel biomarker&#xD;
      discovery on a larger scale and investigations less &quot;biased&quot; by existing knowledge. The&#xD;
      overarching hypothesis of this study is that a multi-marker model incorporating novel&#xD;
      proteins discovered with plasma proteomics improves diagnostic accuracy for acute HF. In a&#xD;
      preliminary proof of concept study plasma proteomics was utilized to discover a multi-marker&#xD;
      panel of 21 biomarkers which improved diagnostic accuracy for acute HF beyond current&#xD;
      clinical practice using clinical data and NP levels. These promising preliminary data&#xD;
      motivate broader discovery in a larger sample size with subsequent derivation and validation&#xD;
      of a multi-marker model for diagnosing acute HF in independent samples of adequate size. The&#xD;
      specific aims of this study are to: 1) discover a multi-marker panel of 21 biomarkers to&#xD;
      improve diagnostic accuracy for acute HF, 2) derive a model for diagnosing acute HF&#xD;
      incorporating the 21-biomarker panel, and 3) test performance of the multi-marker model in a&#xD;
      prospective validation cohort. In aim 1, existing plasma samples from ~900 patients will be&#xD;
      used to assay 925 proteins to discover a smaller set of novel biomarkers most strongly&#xD;
      associated with an adjudicated acute HF diagnosis. In aim 2, an existing prospective&#xD;
      observational cohort, EMROC-AHF, will be utilized to derive the multi-marker model in ~900&#xD;
      patients who presented to the ED with acute dyspnea. In aim 3, from four EDs in Detroit, MI&#xD;
      and Nashville, TN a new sample will prospectively recruit ~1,000 patients presenting with&#xD;
      acute dyspnea and adjudicate the presence of acute HF by cardiologist panel review. Given the&#xD;
      burden of HF, the frequency of inaccurate diagnosis and its adverse consequences, this study&#xD;
      will address a significant unmet need by improving diagnostic accuracy for acute HF.&#xD;
