      All patients will be informed about the study and those who give written consent will be&#xD;
      included in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Women undergoing good quality embryo transfer will be assigned to one of the 3 arms of the&#xD;
      study according to the previously determined randomization chart. The first evaluation of the&#xD;
      patient will be made on the 12th day after embryo transfer. Pregnancy status will be&#xD;
      evaluated with serum βhcg value. If pregnancy is confirmed by serum βhcg value, fetal&#xD;
      viability will be evaluated by ultrasound 4 weeks after transfer.&#xD;

    <intervention_model>Parallel Assignment</intervention_model>
    <intervention_model_description>It is a parallel model interventional study. The sample size is calculated as 180 patients. Sixty patients will be assigned to each study arm by randomization. It is planned to use random computerized numbers for randomization. İn arm 1, cervical mucus will be removed with a cotton swab before embryo transfer. In arm 2, cervical mucus will be removed with a canula before embryo transfer. In arm cervical mucus will not be removed.</intervention_model_description>
    <primary_purpose>Treatment</primary_purpose>
    <masking>Single (Participant)</masking>
    <masking_description>Participant masking: Embryo transfer is done while the patient is lying in lithotomy position in accordance with gynecological examination. The patient is informed about the preparations before the embryo transfer and then the examination is completed. The patient will not be informed about the method used for removal of the cervical mucus. The patient's lying position also does not allow observation of the material used to remove cervical mucus.</masking_description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Success of embryo transfer during intervention.</measure>
    <time_frame>5 minutes after embryo transfer.</time_frame>
    <description>In some cases, the embryo is transferred to the endometrial cavity and comes back with the transfer cannula. For this reason, the embryology laboratory checks the transfer cannula after the transfer. If the embryo is still in the embryo transfer cannula, a second attempt is made for embryo transfer. As a secondary outcome, we will evaluate the success in the first attempt for embryo transfer.</description>
