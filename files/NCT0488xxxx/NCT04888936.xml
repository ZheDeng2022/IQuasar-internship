      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      RASopathies are a group of conditions caused by a genetic change. People with a RASopathy may&#xD;
      have developmental issues, cognitive disability, poor growth, and birth defects. They may&#xD;
      also have an increased risk for developing cancer. Researchers want to learn more.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: To learn more about RASopathies, how genes and environmental factors contribute to&#xD;
      cancer development in people with RASopathies, and the best way to find these cancers and&#xD;
      other conditions early or prevent them.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      People of any age who have or may have a RASopathy, and their family members.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will complete questionnaires about their personal and family medical history.&#xD;
      Their medical records will be reviewed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will give blood and urine samples. They will give a saliva or cheek cell sample.&#xD;
      Some samples will be used for genetic testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants may have a skin biopsy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants may have a physical exam by the RASopathies study team. They may also have exams&#xD;
      by additional specialists, such as dentists; urologists; ear, nose, and throat doctors; and&#xD;
      neurologists.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants may have computed tomography of the face and mouth. They may have an ultrasound&#xD;
      of the abdomen. They may have a bone density scan. They may have skeletal and/or spine&#xD;
      x-rays. They may have magnetic resonance imaging of the brain, low back, chest, and/or heart.&#xD;
      They may be photographed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants may have other tests, such as sleep, brain and heart electrical activity, speech&#xD;
      and swallow, metabolism, hearing, eye, and colon function tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants may sign separate consent forms for some tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participation will last indefinitely. Participants may be contacted once in a while by phone&#xD;
      or mail. They may have follow-up visits.&#xD;

      Study Description:&lt;TAB&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
      The RASopathies are a clinically defined group of disorders caused by pathogenic germline&#xD;
      variants in genes encoding components of the Ras/mitogen-activated-protein kinase (Ras/MAPK)&#xD;
      pathway. These disorders have overlapping clinical features due to Ras/MAPK dysfunction,&#xD;
      including a predisposition to the development of certain malignancies. The aims of this&#xD;
      prospective longitudinal cohort study are to determine the incidence of malignancy in&#xD;
      patients with RASopathies and determine the underlying differences in those who develop&#xD;
      tumors as compared to those who do not, in order to inform cancer screening recommendations.&#xD;
      In addition, this longitudinal cohort study will provide a better understanding of non-tumor&#xD;
      RASopathy manifestations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To establish a longitudinal cohort of participants with a clinical diagnosis of a RASopathy&#xD;
      and/or a pathogenic germline variation in a Ras/MAPK pathway gene (excluding NF1).&#xD;
&#xD;
      To study the lifetime rates of cancer development in participants with a RASopathy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To longitudinally characterize germline RASopathy-related tumor and non-tumor clinical&#xD;
      manifestations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To create a biospecimen repository of carefully annotated tissue samples for use in&#xD;
      subsequent etiologically oriented translational research projects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To describe novel phenotypes associated with germline Ras/MAPK pathway genetic variation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Endpoints:&lt;TAB&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
      Number of participants meeting enrollment criteria for inclusion in the RASopathy cohort.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Development of RASopathy-associated neoplasms in patients with RASopathies other than&#xD;
      neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Longitudinal standardized quantitative evaluations of specific RASopathy manifestations.&#xD;

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Carriers: An individual who meets any of the following criteria will be eligible to&#xD;
        participate in this study:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Individuals with a clinical diagnosis of a RASopathy, including Costello syndrome,&#xD;
             Noonan syndrome, Noonan syndrome with multiple lentigines, Cardiofaciocutaneous&#xD;
             syndrome, Legius syndrome, capillary arteriovenous malformation syndrome, or others,&#xD;
             are eligible. Published clinical diagnostic criteria exist for most of the clinical&#xD;
             RASopathy syndromes and differ by syndrome. It will be uncommon for individuals to&#xD;
             have a clinical diagnosis and not have had molecular genetic testing. All individuals&#xD;
             considered by the study team to be at risk for a RASopathy who have not had prior&#xD;
             genetic testing will have this completed as part of the study. The rare individuals&#xD;
             with a clinical diagnosis of a RASopathy who are not found to carry a corresponding&#xD;
             pathogenic or likely pathogenic variant in a known RASopathy gene will be considered&#xD;
             for exome analysis for identification of potentially novel RASopathy germline&#xD;
             variation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Individuals with a germline variant (P/LP or a variant of uncertain significance but&#xD;
             predicted bioinformatically to be damaging) in a RASopathy-associated gene are&#xD;
             eligible. These include but are not limited to: BRAF, CBL, HRAS, KRAS, LZTR1, MAP2K1,&#xD;
&#xD;
        MAP2K2, MAP3K8, MRAS, NRAS, PPP1CB, PTPN11, RAF1, RASA1, RASA2, RIT1, RRAS, SHOC2, SOS1,&#xD;
        SPRED1,57. From herein, we refer to 1) individuals with germline pathogenic variation in a&#xD;
        RAS pathway gene AND 2) individuals with a clinical RASopathy diagnosis but in whom a&#xD;
        genetic variant has not yet been identified as &quot;carriers.&quot; The first member of a family to&#xD;
        be identified is termed a &quot;proband.&quot;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Individuals with NF1 only are not eligible for the study. However, individuals with a&#xD;
             dual diagnosis of both NF1 and another RASopathy (via genetic testing and/or clinical&#xD;
             diagnosis) are eligible for the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  All types and amounts of prior therapies are allowed.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  There is no age restriction.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  There is no restriction related to organ and marrow function.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Each carrier (or their appropriate surrogate if the carrier is unable) must sign an&#xD;
             IRB-approved document of informed consent to demonstrate their understanding of the&#xD;
             investigational nature and the risk of this study before any protocol-related studies&#xD;
             are&#xD;
&#xD;
        performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Controls: Family members of carriers are eligible for enrollment. Genetic testing in a&#xD;
        CLIA-certified lab will be offered to these blood-related family members to establish&#xD;
        whether or not a variant may be segregating in a family with incomplete penetrance. As most&#xD;
        of the RASopathy syndromes are sporadic, extensive testing and enrollment of extended&#xD;
        family members (grandparents, aunts, uncles) will likely not be necessary in many&#xD;
        pedigrees. Family members who have undergone genetic testing for the proband's RAS variant&#xD;
        and do not harbor it (or nonblood-related family members) are controls. Carriers and&#xD;
        controls in this study are referred to as &quot;participants,&quot; &quot;individuals,&quot; or &quot;patients.&quot;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  All types and amounts of prior therapies are allowed&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  There is no age restriction.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  There is no restriction related to organ and marrow function.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Each control (or their appropriate surrogate if the control is unable) must sign an&#xD;
             IRB-approved document of informed consent to demonstrate their understanding of the&#xD;
             investigational nature and the risk of this study before any protocol-related studies&#xD;
             are&#xD;
&#xD;
        performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Research Eligibility Evaluation: This is solely a function of meeting the inclusion&#xD;
        criteria described above and not fulfilling any of the exclusion criteria in section 0&#xD;
        below.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Carriers: An individual who meets any of the following criteria will be excluded from&#xD;
        participation in this study:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Individuals with only a diagnosis of NF1, or a newly identified germline pathogenic&#xD;
             germline variant in NF1, and first-degree relatives of these patients are ineligible.&#xD;
             However, individuals with a dual diagnosis of both NF1 and another RASopathy (via&#xD;
             genetic testing and/or clinical diagnosis) are eligible for the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Individuals who, in the opinion of the investigator, are not able to return for&#xD;
             follow-up visits or obtain required follow-up studies will be excluded from&#xD;
             participation in the NIH Clinical Center Cohort.&#xD;
