  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Regional oral and maxillofacial defects secondary to ablative tissue resection can contribute&#xD;
      to severe aesthetic and functional loss, which influences patients' regular life and may&#xD;
      cause psychological problems. Microvascular free flaps are considered the gold standard for&#xD;
      reconstructing large oral and maxillofacial defects. In the past decade, with the help of&#xD;
      computer-aided design (CAD)/ computer-aided manufacturing (CAM) customized implants and&#xD;
      prosthesis (CIP) have led to a significant improvement of the operative accuracy, improve the&#xD;
      flap survival rate and enhance the patients' quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Concerning the increased overall survival rate of the patients, people pay more attention to&#xD;
      the quality of life and aesthetic appearance which are influenced by the fitness and&#xD;
      compatibility of the CIP. However, from literature reviews, the evaluation was various to be&#xD;
      concluded in some certain conditions from pooled studies.&#xD;

      The trial will be conducted in compliance with the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki&#xD;
      (specifying which amendment), the principles of GCP, and all of the applicable regulatory&#xD;
      requirements. This protocol and related documents will the for review to the Ethics&#xD;
      Committee. The Investigator and the Participating Site shall treat all information and data&#xD;
      relating to the Study disclosed to Participating Site and/or Investigator in this Study as&#xD;
      confidential and shall not disclose such information to any third parties or use such&#xD;
      information for any purpose other than the performance of the Study. The collection,&#xD;
      processing, and disclosure of personal data, such as patient health and medical information&#xD;
      is subject to compliance with applicable personal data protection and the processing of&#xD;
      personal data (Directive 95/46/EC and Belgian law of December 8, 1992, on the Protection of&#xD;
      the Privacy in relation to the Processing of Personal Data). The extracted data will be&#xD;
      encoded, the subject's EAD-number will be stored separately(site file) from the research data&#xD;
      and replaced with a unique study ID-code to create a new identity for the subject. The file&#xD;
      containing the patient-specific EAD-numbers will be kept on a secured UZ Leuven servers.&#xD;

        The files of patients diagnosed and treated between December 2004 and January 2020 for&#xD;
        defect of dentition secondary to jaw resection were retrospectively reviewed. The patients&#xD;
        who underwent dental implant surgery after ablative tumor resection with segmental&#xD;
        mandibulectomy and vascularized bone flap graft were retrieved from the database.&#xD;
