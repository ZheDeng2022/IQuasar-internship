  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Vaccine hesitancy also concerns healthcare workers (HCWs). However, HCWs are at the frontline&#xD;
      of the COVID-19 pandemic and identified as a priority target group for COVID-19 vaccines.&#xD;
      Thus, the identification of interventions likely to improve COVID-19 vaccine attitudes and&#xD;
      intentions among HCWs is of interests to increase the vaccine coverage among HCWs. The study&#xD;
      hypothesis is that the use of the same chatbot as the one tested in the general population in&#xD;
      France could also improve the COVID-19 vaccine intentions and perceptions in HCWs.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Most countries face the issue of vaccine hesitancy, with sizeable fractions, or sometimes the&#xD;
      majority, of the public opposing some vaccines. The problem is particularly acute in the case&#xD;
      of COVID-19 vaccination: first, a high uptake of COVID-19 vaccines is necessary to reach and&#xD;
      sustain herd immunity; second, and to the best of our knowledge, no country is currently&#xD;
      planning on making COVID-19 vaccination mandatory, making public approval essential.&#xD;
      Unfortunately, hesitancy towards COVID-19 vaccines is high in many countries. It is therefore&#xD;
      crucial that health authorities make it as easy as possible for people who want to be&#xD;
      vaccinated to do so, but also that they devise communication strategies to reassure vaccine&#xD;
      hesitant individuals. A recent study performed in France (Altay S, et al. 2021) introduced a&#xD;
      novel messaging strategy: the use of a chatbot that answers people's questions about COVID-19&#xD;
      vaccines. Results suggest that a properly scripted and regularly updated chatbot could offer&#xD;
      a powerful resource to help fight hesitancy towards COVID-19 vaccines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Vaccine hesitancy also concerns healthcare workers (HCWs). However, HCWs are at the frontline&#xD;
      of the COVID-19 pandemic and identified as a priority target group for COVID-19 vaccines.&#xD;
      Thus, the identification of tools likely to improve COVID-19 vaccine attitudes and intentions&#xD;
      among HCWs is of interests to increase the vaccine coverage among HCWs. The study hypothesis&#xD;
      is that the use of the same chatbot as the one tested in the general population in France&#xD;
      could also improve the COVID-19 vaccine intentions and perceptions in HCWs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective will be to evaluate the short impact of the use of a chatbot on the&#xD;
      evolution of the COVID-19 vaccine perceptions in HCWs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objectives will be:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the impact at 15-days of the use of a chatbot on the evolution of the&#xD;
           COVID-19 vaccine perceptions in HCWs.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the short and at 15-days impact of the use of a chatbot on the evolution of&#xD;
           the COVID-19 vaccine intentions in HCWs globally and by vaccine.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To describe the chatbot connection rate, the interaction time with the chatbot and&#xD;
           feedback from the device&#xD;
&#xD;
      These objectives (primary and secondary) will be decline in the sub-groups of caregivers and&#xD;
      non-caregivers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study population will be made up of HCWs from the ESPERES cohort. For the purposes of&#xD;
      this study, a &quot;healthcare worker&quot; is defined as an individual who currently works in a&#xD;
      setting where individuals receive healthcare (i.e. individuals do not have to work directly&#xD;
      with patients, but may have any role within a setting where individuals receive healthcare,&#xD;
      such as administrative office, housekeeping, food service, etc.).&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is a randomized, two-arm, open label, parallel trial. Participants will be asked to answer&#xD;
      a new questionnaire on their COVID-19 vaccine intention and perception, 15 days after their&#xD;
      inclusion in the ESPERES cohort. Participants in ESPERES cohort who meet the eligibility&#xD;
      criteria for the trial evaluating the chatbot will be randomized into 2 arms: access to the&#xD;
      chatbot (intervention group) or access to simple information (control group). Randomization&#xD;
      will be carried out at a 1:1 ratio, on blocks of four, stratified on the&#xD;
      caregiver/non-caregiver group and the health facility. Randomization will be done online&#xD;
      which ensures allocation concealment. Depending on the randomization group, participants&#xD;
      access the chatbot or simple information. They can consult them as long as they wish.&#xD;
      Participants will be contacted immediately after the first connection to the chatbot and&#xD;
      again 15-days later to complete questionnaires on their COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy and&#xD;
      perception.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The statistical analyses planned in the research protocol and those responding to specific&#xD;
      subsequent studies nested in ESPERES and validated by the scientific committee, will be&#xD;
      performed by the pharmaco-epidemiology center (CEPHEPI), under the responsibility of Dr&#xD;
      Candice ESTELLAT and Pr Florence TUBACH. The CEPHEPI is backed by the public health&#xD;
      department of the hospital group Pitié-Salpêtrière - Charles Foix, AP-HP.&#xD;
