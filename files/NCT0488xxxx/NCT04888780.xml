      Objective: This study was conducted to determine the effect of diabetes training on HbA1c,&#xD;
      levels of depression and quality of life of Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus adolescents by using the&#xD;
      Web-Based Watson Human Care Model.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: The study was conducted with 30 adolescents between 11-18 years old who was followed&#xD;
      by Child Endocrinology Department and who accepted to participate in the research. A web page&#xD;
      was developed by considering Training Guide for Adolescents with Type 1 Diabetes and&#xD;
      processes of Watson Human Care Theory. Live video interviews were done with adolescents in&#xD;
      the experiment group on 14 sessions and these interviews were recorded.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Children's Depression Inventory (CDI)</measure>
    <time_frame>5 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>CDI was developed by Kovacs in order to determine the severity of depression in children. The inventory was developed by using a language that could be easily understood by children and adolescents in ages from 6 to 17 years. It was adapted into Turkish by Öy (1990).It consists of 27 items. In each item, there are three sentences between which child or adolescent can choose by considering her/his two weeks before the application.Scores ranging from 0-2 are given to the answers given. High scores indicate the level of depression, and the highest score that can be obtained from the scale is 54. The cut-off point of the scale is 19.(Cronbach's alpha = 0.86)</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Paediatric Quality of Life Inventory (PedsQL)</measure>
    <time_frame>5 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>The Inventory was developed by Varni et al. (2003). It measures the quality of life both generally and specific to the disease. PedsQL was adapted into Turkish by Ayar and is the only type of quality of life inventory that includes scales both for the child and the parent. The inventory consists of 28 items and is divided into 5 sub-scales; which are diabetes symptoms comprising 11 items, treatment barriers comprising 4 items, treatment adherence comprising 7 items, worry comprising 3 items, and communication comprising 3 items. The high total score obtained from the scale indicates that the health-related quality of life is good. (Cronbach's alpha = 0.95)</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Quality Criteria for Consumer Health Information (DISCERN) Website Evaluation Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>2 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>DISCERN instrument; which was developed by Charnock et al. (1997) and adapted into Turkish in our country by Gokdogan and et al. (2003) was used in the research. The guide to the DISCERN quality criteria is used in order to evaluate the quality and reliability of the written materials that present health-related information. The instrument consists of 16 questions in total. The first 8 questions (1-8) in the guide evaluate the reliability of the presented information; the next 7 questions (9-15) evaluate the quality of the information about treatment and care, and the last question (16) evaluates the material in general. Each question is given a score of 1-5 (5: available, 1: unavailable).A total of 15 points indicate that the web page prepared is low in terms of information quality, and 75 points indicate high information quality.</description>

In these interviews, the clinical picture of diabetes and the psychosocial status of adolescents were discussed. A total of 14 interviews with 15-day intervals were made with each adolescent. All video interviews were carried out by the first researcher and they were all recorded.</description>
