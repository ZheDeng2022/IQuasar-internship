      A phase 1/2, open-label clinical trial in individuals, 18 years of age and older, who are in&#xD;
      good health, have no known history of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) or Severe Acute&#xD;
      Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, and meet all other eligibility&#xD;
      criteria. This clinical trial is designed to assess the safety, reactogenicity and&#xD;
      immunogenicity of a delayed (&gt;/=12 weeks) vaccine boost on a range of Emergency Use&#xD;
      Authorization (EUA)-dosed COVID-19 vaccines (mRNA-1273, and mRNA-1273.211 manufactured by&#xD;
      ModernaTX, Inc.; BNT162b2 manufactured by Pfizer/BioNTech; or Ad26.COV2.S manufactured by&#xD;
      Janssen Pharmaceuticals/Johnson &amp; Johnson). This is an adaptive design and may add arms (and&#xD;
      increase sample size) as vaccines are awarded EUA and/or variant lineage spike vaccines are&#xD;
      manufactured or become available. Enrollment will occur at up to twelve domestic clinical&#xD;
      research sites.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study includes two cohorts. Cohort 1 will include approximately 550 individuals (50&#xD;
      subjects/group; Groups 1E-11E) greater than 18 years of age and older, stratified into two&#xD;
      age strata (18-55 years and &gt;/=56 years) who previously received COVID-19 vaccine at&#xD;
      Emergency Use Authorization dosing (EUA) (two vaccinations of mRNA-1273 at the 100 mcg dose,&#xD;
      two vaccinations of mRNA-BNT162b2 at the 30 mcg dose, or one vaccination of Ad26.COV2.S at&#xD;
      the 5x10^10 vp dose). Those subjects will be offered enrollment into this study &gt;/=12 weeks&#xD;
      after they received the last dose of their EUA vaccine. Subjects will receive a single&#xD;
      open-label intramuscular (IM) injection of the designated delayed booster vaccine and will be&#xD;
      followed through 12 months after vaccination: 1) Group 1E - previously EUA-dosed vaccination&#xD;
      with Janssen - Ad26.COV.2.S at 5x10^10 vp followed by a 100-mcg dose of mRNA-1273, Group 4E -&#xD;
      previously EUA-dosed vaccination with Janssen - Ad26.COV.2.S at 5x10^10 vp followed by a&#xD;
      5x10^10 vp dose of Ad26.COV2.S, Group 7E - previously EUA-dosed vaccination with Janssen -&#xD;
      Ad26.COV.2.S 5x10^10 vp followed by a 30-mcg dose of BNT162b2, Group 10E - previously&#xD;
      EUA-dosed vaccination with Janssen - Ad26.COV2-S 5x10^10 vp followed by a 100-mcg dose of&#xD;
      mRNA-1273.211; 2) Group 2E - previously EUA-dosed vaccination with Moderna - mRNA-1273 at 100&#xD;
      mcg for two doses followed by a 100-mcg dose of mRNA-1273, Group 5E - previously EUA-dosed&#xD;
      vaccination with Moderna - mRNA-1273 at 100 mcg for two doses followed by a 5x10^10 vp dose&#xD;
      of Ad26.COV2.S, Group 8E - previously EUA-dosed vaccination with Moderna - mRNA-1273 at 100&#xD;
      mcg for two doses followed by a 30-mcg dose of BNT162b2; 3) Group 3E - previously EUA-dosed&#xD;
      vaccination with Pfizer/BioNTech - BNT162b2 at 30 mcg for two doses followed by a 100-mcg&#xD;
      dose of mRNA-1273. Group 6E - previously EUA-dosed vaccination with Pfizer/BioNTech -&#xD;
      BNT162b2 at 30 mcg for two doses followed by a 5x10^10 vp dose of Ad26.COV2.S, Group 9E -&#xD;
      previously EUA-dosed vaccination with Pfizer/BioNTech - BNT162b2 at 30 mcg for two doses&#xD;
      followed by a 30-mcg dose of BNT162b2, Group 11E - previously EUA-dosed vaccination with&#xD;
      Pfizer/BioNTech - BNT162b2 at 30 mcg for two doses followed by a 100-mcg dose of&#xD;
      mRNA-1273.211.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A telephone visit will occur one week after each primary EUA vaccination and one week after&#xD;
      the booster dose. In person follow-up visits will occur on 14 days following completion of&#xD;
      EUA vaccinations and on days 14, and 28 days after the booster dose, as well as 3, 6, and 12&#xD;
      months post the booster vaccination. Additional pools of subjects can be included if needed&#xD;
      as additional COVID-19 vaccines are awarded EUA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      New groups may be added to Cohort 1 or 2 dependent upon manufacture of variant lineage spike&#xD;
      protein-based vaccine constructs or vaccines newly awarded EUA. The primary objectives of&#xD;
      this study are 1) to evaluate the safety and reactogenicity of delayed heterologous or&#xD;
      homologous vaccine doses after EUA dosed vaccines, and 2) to evaluate the breadth of the&#xD;
      humoral immune responses of heterologous and homologous delayed boost regimens following EUA&#xD;
      dosing.&#xD;

      A telephone visit will occur at Day 8 and in-person follow-up visits will occur on Days 15&#xD;
