      The study was planned in a randomized controlled manner in order to evaluate the effect of&#xD;
      mother's voice and lullaby on stress and sleep-wake situations of premature babies.&#xD;

      Objective:This randomized controlled study was carried out to evaluate the effect of mother's&#xD;
      voice and lullaby on preterm infants' stress and sleeping-waking states.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design:The study was carried out in a newborn unit in a public hospital in Turkey. In&#xD;
      this study, 90 preterm newborn were divided into three groups equally as mother's voice&#xD;
      (n=30), lullaby (n=30) and control groups (n=30). Data were obtained by Mother and Newborn&#xD;
      Identification Form, Newborn Stress Evaluation Form (NSEF) and Newborn Sleepıng-Wakıng State&#xD;
      Evaluation Form (NSWEF). On the 1st, 3rd and 5th days of the study; Newborns' NSEF and NSWEF&#xD;
      scores at pre-, post-study and on the fifth minutes were evaluated. Data were evaluated by&#xD;
      using descriptive statistics, homogeneity tests, chi-square, intra-class correlation&#xD;
      coefficent, two way of analysis on repeated measures, generalized linear model, pearson&#xD;
      correlation analysis.&#xD;

    <measure>Newborn Stress Evaluation Form (NSEF)</measure>
    <time_frame>NSEF was measured on days 1 through 5, which had a 5-day application period.</time_frame>
    <description>NSEF, there is no stress indicator '0', mild stress indicators' 1 ', moderate stress indicators' 2', and severe stress indicators'. It is scored as 3.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Newborn Sleepıng-Wakıng State Evaluation Form (NSWEF)</measure>
    <time_frame>NSWEF NSEF was measured on days 1 through 5, which had a 5-day application period.</time_frame>
    <description>The evaluation of the newborn status was carried out under the main headings of sleep and waking behaviors. Sleep behavior; deep sleep, light sleep and drowsy. Waking behavior is grouped under the headings of awake (extremely awake and eyelids awake), active awake and crying. As a result of the evaluation, it was decided that the behaviors of the newborn were in an organized or disorganized range, and the form was marked and scoring was created for the conditions starting from the deep sleep state to disorganized crying. In the evaluation of the data; The interpretation was made according to the state score of the newborn. It was interpreted that as the YUUDF score decreased, the sleep state of the newborns increased, and as the YUUDF score increased, the wakefulness and crying status of the newborns increased.</description>
