  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A parallel, prospective, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial will be conducted in&#xD;
      the population affiliated to EPS SURAMERICANA S.A. with positive test for antigen and PCR for&#xD;
      SARS-CoV-2. Participants will be randomly assigned in a 1: 1 ratio to the intervention group&#xD;
      or the control group using a sequence of random numbers. The patients included will be those&#xD;
      with less than 7 days from the onset of symptoms, and without evidence of serious disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One group will be assigned oral ivermectin therapy at a dose of 600 mcg/kg every 12 hours for&#xD;
      5 consecutive days, and the other group will received placebo. A minimum sample size of 483&#xD;
      patients for each arm was calculated to observe differences. All randomized patients will be&#xD;
      included in the analysis according to the randomization arm (intention-to-treat analysis).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective is to evaluate the efficacy of ivermectin in the prevention of severe&#xD;
      disease, reduction in the rate of hospitalization, reduction of ICU stay, and mortality. This&#xD;
      evaluation will be carried out up to 28 days after the intervention begins. Given the public&#xD;
      health emergency, the study is expected to be completed in a period of 6 months from the&#xD;
      INVIMA approval.&#xD;
