  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Persistent opioid abuse presents a common yet under-recognized problem given the decreasing&#xD;
      rates of morbidity and mortality following common elective surgical procedures, like total&#xD;
      joint arthroplasty (TJA). Each year around 33-70% of patients seeking surgical procedures in&#xD;
      the U.S. transition to persistent opioid use following elective surgery (such as TJA),&#xD;
      primarily prescribed for post-operative pain management. Further, these patients are more&#xD;
      likely to demand greater doses and for longer duration post-surgery due to maladaptive&#xD;
      neurologic changes occurring in key areas of the brain. The purpose of this study is to see&#xD;
      if it is feasible to use OLP (open label placebo) for post-operative pain management in the&#xD;
      post TJA setting. In addition the investigators will also collect pilot data to compare key&#xD;
      outcome measures (patient reported physical function related to osteoarthritis of the hip and&#xD;
      knee, pain score, and health-related quality of life will be assessed) between the placebo&#xD;
      and the Treatment-As-Usual (TAU) group over a 90-day post-operative period.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators will enroll 24 adults that have undergone primary total joint arthroplasty&#xD;
      and are requesting additional pain medication at 2 weeks. Once informed, consented and&#xD;
      enrolled, participants will be assessed, randomized to either open-label placebo (OLP) or&#xD;
      treatment-as-usual (TUA). Participants will be informed on why the OLP may manage the&#xD;
      symptoms of postoperative pain and the benefits of OLP vs an Opioid. Patients randomized to&#xD;
      OLP will be given placebo pills at their 2 week follow-up appointment (baseline) if&#xD;
      additional pain medication is requested. Patients will be instructed to utilize placebo pill&#xD;
      in the same manner as their previous medication. If interested, the participant will be&#xD;
      consented in clinic and a consent signed in person. Pain control, joint function, and quality&#xD;
      of life assessment scores will be conducted at 2, 6, and 12 week follow-up visits in clinic.&#xD;
      After randomization, the placebo group will receive a scripted orientation that mimics a&#xD;
      typical patient-provider interaction when prescribing a pain medication, including the&#xD;
      rationale for effectiveness and the importance of taking the placebo pills as prescribed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Open-label placebo adherence will be assessed using pill count. The investigators will ask&#xD;
      all participants to maintain their current treatment regimens over the course of the study.&#xD;
      After 12 weeks, all participants will complete final assessments. Participants in the OLP&#xD;
      group will be monitored in clinic to allow for additional pain control if required.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study outcomes will be measured using SF-36 quality of life score, Visual Analog Scale, Hip&#xD;
      disability and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score, and Knee disability and Osteoarthritis Outcome&#xD;
      Score. The investigators will also collect information about potential moderators that would&#xD;
      include demographic data (e.g., age, years since diagnosis, treatments, gender), use of&#xD;
      disease modifying therapies (oral versus infusion), types of medications, total number of&#xD;
      medications, history of opioid abuse, history of opioid use, presence of a diagnosed&#xD;
      cognitive or psychiatric disorder, mood disorder.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ANCOVA will be used to measure treatment effect with baseline measurement used as a&#xD;
      covariate. Effect sizes and estimates of correlation between pre-post measures will be&#xD;
      estimated.&#xD;
