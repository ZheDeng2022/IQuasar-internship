      The study is a Randomized, Open-Label, Multi-Centre, Phase 2a Study to Evaluate the Safety&#xD;
      and Effect of STC3141 Continuous Infusion in Subjects with Severe Corona Virus Disease&#xD;
      2019（COVID-19）Pneumonia.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Pneumonia is the most frequent and serious complication of Corona Virus Disease&#xD;
      2019（COVID-19）, a disease that results from severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus&#xD;
      2（SARS-CoV-2）infection with a so-called &quot;cytokine storm&quot;, characterized by the plasma&#xD;
      increase of many cytokines that produce long-term damage and fibrosis of lung tissue.&#xD;
      Therefore, the development of novel therapeutic strategies to target at neutrophils&#xD;
      associated NETs/histones may reduce the overall disease mortality rate of COVID-19.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STC3141 is a novel investigational product that can neutralize NETs/histone via charge-charge&#xD;
      interaction. STC3141 was found to be well-tolerated in short infusions (2 hours) and&#xD;
      continuous long-term infusions (72 hours) in healthy volunteers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A randomized, multi-centre, phase 2a study in 25 severe COVID-19 pneumonia subjects who&#xD;
      require hospitalization, is designed to evaluate the safety and the preliminary effect of&#xD;
      STC3141 in this population where the treatment will be tested for the first time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be randomized to three cohorts in a 2:2:1 ratio to receive continuous infusion&#xD;
      of STC3141 either at rate 58.3mg/hr or 87.5mg/hr up to 3 days (72hours), or to receive&#xD;
      appropriate standard of care. All subjects in STC3141 treatment groups will also receive&#xD;
      standard of care for their conditions as background treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the safety of STC3141 in subjects with&#xD;
      severe COVID-19 pneumonia.The secondary objective is to evaluate the preliminary effects of&#xD;
      STC3141 in the treatment of subjects with severe COVID-19 pneumonia.As an exploratory&#xD;
      objective, the change in biomarkers from baseline following STC3141 treatment in subjects&#xD;
      with severe COVID-19 pneumonia will be evaluated.&#xD;
