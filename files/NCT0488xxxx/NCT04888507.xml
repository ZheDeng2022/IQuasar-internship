  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of pozelimab&#xD;
      and cemdisiran combination therapy in participants with PNH who switch from eculizumab&#xD;
      therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objectives of the study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the effect of the combination treatment on the following parameters of&#xD;
           intravascular hemolysis: lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) control, breakthrough hemolysis,&#xD;
           and inhibition of CH50&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the effect of the combination treatment on the stability of LDH during the&#xD;
           transition period from eculizumab monotherapy to combination with pozelimab and&#xD;
           cemdisiran&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the effect of the combination treatment on red blood cell (RBC) transfusion&#xD;
           requirements&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the effect of the combination treatment on hemoglobin levels&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the effect of the combination treatment on clinical outcome assessments&#xD;
           (COAs) measuring fatigue and health related quality of life (HRQoL)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the concentrations of total pozelimab and eculizumab in serum; and total&#xD;
           cemdisiran and C5 protein in plasma&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the immunogenicity of pozelimab and cemdisiran&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess safety after dose intensification&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the long-term safety and efficacy of the combination treatment in an&#xD;
           optional open-label extension period (OLEP)&#xD;

    <description>OLTP The FACIT-Fatigue is a 13-item, self-reported PRO measure assessing an individual's level of fatigue during their usual daily activities over the past week. This questionnaire is part of the FACIT measurement system, a compilation of questions measuring health-related QoL in patients with cancer and other chronic illnesses. The FACIT-fatigue assesses the level of fatigue using a Likert scale ranging from 0 (not at all) to 4 (very much). Scores range from 0 to 52, with higher scores indicating greater fatigue.</description>

    <description>OLTP EORTC-QLQ-C30 is a 30-item subject self-report questionnaire composed of both multi-item and single scales, including a global health status/quality of life (GHS/QoL) scale. Participants rate items on a four-point scale, with 1 as &quot;not at all&quot; and 4 as &quot;very much.&quot; A change of 5 - 10 points is considered a small. A change of 10 - 20 points is considered a moderate change.</description>
