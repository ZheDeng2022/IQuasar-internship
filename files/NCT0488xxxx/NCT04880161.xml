  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase I study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of inhaled Ampion on patients&#xD;
      with prolonged respiratory symptoms due to COVID-19 (Long COVID).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Increasing numbers of people with COVID-19 are experiencing the lingering effects of COVID-19&#xD;
      and continue to have prolonged respiratory complications months after the onset of the&#xD;
      disease, also known as Post-Acute Sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 (PASC), long-COVID, and/or&#xD;
      long-hauler patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The SARS-CoV-2 virus is transmitted through the respiratory system, which can cause a severe&#xD;
      dysregulation of the immune response and damage in the lungs. Chronic, prolonged inflammation&#xD;
      of the lungs maybe responsible for a myriad of continuing respiratory signs and symptoms&#xD;
      post-infection, including cough, shortness of breath, chest discomfort, low exercise&#xD;
      tolerance and low blood oxygen saturation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ampion is the low molecular weight filtrate of human serum albumin with the in vitro ability&#xD;
      to modulate inflammatory cytokine levels. Ampion has the potential to improve clinical&#xD;
      outcomes for long-COVID patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aims to evaluate the safety of Ampion and the clinical outcomes in patients with&#xD;
      long-COVID.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Male or female adults: ≥ 18 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Must have a clinical diagnosis of COVID-19 at least 4 weeks prior to the screening&#xD;
             date, with at least one of clinical symptoms (e.g., fever ≥ 38°C, fatigue, cough) and&#xD;
             a positive result by the reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)&#xD;
             testing or equivalent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Experiencing at least two COVID-19 respiratory symptoms with a score of two or higher&#xD;
             using the FDA Assessment of 14 Common COVID-19-Related Symptoms questionnaire for at&#xD;
             least 4 weeks (28 days) after initial positive COVID-19 diagnosis: cough, sore throat,&#xD;
             runny/stuffy nose, shortness of breath (difficulties breathing), tightness of chest,&#xD;
             low exercise tolerance.&#xD;
