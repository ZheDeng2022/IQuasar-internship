  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test the safety of a novel gene viral vector treatment for&#xD;
      adults with cocaine use disorder-sustained remission. This gene regulates an enzyme (cocaine&#xD;
      hydrolase) that breaks down cocaine into inactive substances, thereby decreasing the&#xD;
      pleasurable feeling this drug usually provides.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase-I dose escalation clinical trial testing the safety and MTD of IV&#xD;
      administration of AAV8-hCocH to subjects with a history of cocaine use disorder-sustained&#xD;
      remission. Subjects who provide written informed consent, meet entry criteria, and do not&#xD;
      have transduction inhibition to AAV8 (pre-existing AAV8 antibodies) will be eligible.&#xD;
      Subjects will be enrolled sequentially every 2-3 months or longer between cohorts. Dose&#xD;
      escalation may be initiated after a single subject has been safely dosed; maximum enzyme&#xD;
      expression is anticipated at week 3-4. This escalation paradigm is intended to minimize the&#xD;
      number of subjects exposed to sub-therapeutic doses. The starting dose is based on the&#xD;
      expression and safety of AAV8-CocH in mice, rats and NHP, and previous human experience using&#xD;
      AAV8-FVIII IV in hemophilia patients. The starting dose has a large safety margin (15-fold)&#xD;
      from the NOAEL in NHP. Approximately 7 weeks after an injection, a decision to escalate to&#xD;
      the next dose level will be made based on a review of safety parameters and CocH levels by&#xD;
      the investigative team.&#xD;
