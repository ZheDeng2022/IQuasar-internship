    <description>Anlotinib hydrochloride capsules is a new type of small molecule multi-target tyrosine kinase inhibitor against angiogenesis.&#xD;
TQB2450 is a humanized monoclonal antibody targeting PD-L1, which prevents PD-L1 from binding to the PD-1 and B7.1 receptors on the surface of T cells, so as to restore the activity of T cells and thereby enhance the immune response, and has the potential to treat various types of tumors.</description>
