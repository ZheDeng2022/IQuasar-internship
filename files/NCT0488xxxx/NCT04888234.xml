    <textblock>
      Radiation-induced dermatitis is the most common complication of radiotherapy for cancer&#xD;
      treatment. However, there is no satisfactory management to deal with the problem.&#xD;
      Ru-Yi-Jin-Huang Powder is one of most common topical TCM drug to treat skin diseases but lack&#xD;
      of evidence to support efficacy. The aim of this trial is to evaluate the effectiveness of&#xD;
      Ru-Yi-Jin-Huang Powder for radiation-induced dermatitis.&#xD;

      The common management of head and neck cancer are concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRT) after&#xD;
      surgical section. Radiation-induced dermatitis is the most common complication of&#xD;
      radiotherapy for cancer, affecting approximately 95 percent of patients receiving&#xD;
      radiotherapy. The skin changes include erythema, edema, pigment changes, hair loss, and dry&#xD;
      or moist desquamation. It may cause xerostomia, hard food taking, severe infection to delay&#xD;
      the completion of course of treatment. Although, there are lots of topical drug to deal with&#xD;
      radiation dermatitis, there is no best way to manage the skin problems. Ru-Yi-Jin-Huang&#xD;
      Powder is one of most common topical TCM drug to treat skin ulcer, joint swelling or other&#xD;
      infective or inflammatory diseases. Some study showed that Ru-Yi-Jin-Huang Powder can be used&#xD;
      to decrease edema or swelling, pain relief, decrease phlebitis or mumps. However, there is no&#xD;
      related evidence to support Ru-Yi-Jin-Huang Powder for radiation dermatitis. Thus, the aim of&#xD;
      the study is to evaluate the effectiveness of Ru-Yi-Jin-Huang Powder for radiation-induced&#xD;
      dermatitis.&#xD;
