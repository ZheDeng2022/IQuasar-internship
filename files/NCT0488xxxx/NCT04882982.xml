  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Menopause is the time of life when menstrual cycles cease. Women typically spend 30-40% of&#xD;
      their lives in menopause. Individual experiences of menopause vary and although some women do&#xD;
      not experience any significant symptoms, common symptoms include vasomotor dysfunction,&#xD;
      vaginal dryness, mood changes, sleep disturbances, urinary incontinence, cognitive changes,&#xD;
      somatic complaints and sexual dysfunction. Reduced quality of life can occur as a result of&#xD;
      these symptoms. A mobile app has been developed to reduce the impact of these symptoms using&#xD;
      a variety of behavioral change techniques including education, goal setting, motivational&#xD;
      enhancement, social support and cognitive behavioral approaches. Participants will complete&#xD;
      self report assessments of women's symptoms and QOL at baseline, 3 weeks and 6 weeks of app&#xD;
      use.&#xD;
