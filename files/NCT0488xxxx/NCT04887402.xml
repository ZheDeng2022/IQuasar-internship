  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a common endocrinological disorder seen in 6%-10% of&#xD;
      women (Human Reproduction, 2004). It is characterized by polycystic ovaries, anovulatory&#xD;
      cycles, and hyperandrogenism.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In nearly 20% of infertile women, PCOS is said to be the key reason behind infertility&#xD;
      (Norman et al., 2007).&#xD;
&#xD;
      PCOS is a syndrome that manifests variably from adolescence as oligomenorrhea or hirsutism or&#xD;
      obesity and goes on to affect the reproductive performance of the female by causing&#xD;
      anovulation. Some may even be severely affected by metabolic syndrome, diabetes mellitus, or&#xD;
      endometrial carcinoma. It also increases the risk of ovarian and breast carcinoma (Atiomo et&#xD;
      al., 2003).&#xD;
&#xD;
      PCOS falls in WHO type II anovulation (norm-gonadotropic norm-estrogenic anovulation) and is&#xD;
      seen in 85% of anovulatory females. Although lifestyle modification is known to improve&#xD;
      reproductive outcomes in females with PCOS, the gold standard treatment for norm-gonadotropic&#xD;
      oligo/amenorrheic infertility (WHO Group II) was clomiphene citrate (CC) (Radosh L., 2009)&#xD;
      until 2018, when ESHRE and ASRM have declared letrozole as the first-line treatment for&#xD;
      ovulation induction (OI)( ESHRE 2018 guidelines).&#xD;
&#xD;
      To conclude, available data shows that letrozole is at least as effective as CC for ovulation&#xD;
      and has comparable live birth rates. Importantly, it has definite advantages over CC. Many&#xD;
      studies have shown letrozole to be as effective as gonadotropins, with added advantage of low&#xD;
      cost and lower multiple pregnancy rates. However, the quality of medical evidence supporting&#xD;
      aromatase inhibitors for OI, are inadequate, small in sample size, and inappropriate design.&#xD;
      Moreover, there is very limited data on potential teratogenic effects, oocyte, embryo&#xD;
      quality, and any effect on implantation. ( Misso et al., 2012) Those who fail to respond to&#xD;
      CC are labeled as clomiphene resistant. It is common in approximately 15%-40% of women with&#xD;
      PCOS (NICE, 2014). Major factors postulated for CC resistance include obesity, insulin&#xD;
      resistance, (seen in nearly 50%-70% of females with PCOS) and hyperandrogenemia (Parsanezhad&#xD;
      et al., 2001).Moreover, genetic predisposition is suggested to play a role in CC resistance&#xD;
      (Overbeek et al., 2009).However, still, the current data available on the causes of CC&#xD;
      resistance are not sufficient enough to direct our treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is seen in various studies (Sohrevardi et al.,2016) that the females who initially failed&#xD;
      to respond to CC develop better ovulation and pregnancy outcomes on treatment with&#xD;
      insulin-sensitizing agents. This indicates that insulin resistance may be a cause of CC&#xD;
      resistance in females with PCOS. In fact, insulin-sensitizing agents (Azziz et al., 2009)&#xD;
      decrease the dose of ovulation-inducing agent and time for follicular maturation in females&#xD;
      with PCOS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As of now, there have been no concrete studies to compare the metabolic profile of females&#xD;
      who respond to CC and those who do not. It is still an enigma as to why some women respond to&#xD;
      clomiphene, while others do not. By identifying the various factors which affect the response&#xD;
      of CC in patients with infertility, a lot of time can be saved by giving alternate options of&#xD;
      treatment to these patients. This study was done with the aim to analyze various clinical,&#xD;
      metabolic, hormonal, and ultrasound parameters that might affect the response to clomiphene.&#xD;

      All PCO patients under the age of 40 who are subfertile with no identified cause but PCO will&#xD;
      undergo the following;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Detailed history taking including age, parity, medical, surgical history, previous&#xD;
           trials of induction of ovulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Physical examination:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Vital data: blood pressure&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  General examination: including weight in kilograms, and height in an upright&#xD;
                posture without shoes using to the nearest 0.5 cm will be recorded. Body mass index&#xD;
                (BMI) will be recorded from the above measurements. Waist circumference (WC) will&#xD;
                be measured midway between the lower rib margin and the iliac crest in the&#xD;
                mid-axillary line at the end of normal expiration. Hip circumference will be&#xD;
                measured with the measuring tape at the highest prominence of the buttocks and&#xD;
                parallel to the floor (Nishida et al., 2010). WC and hip circumference will be&#xD;
                recorded after removing clothing from the area over the waist and hip.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The thyroid will be examined for any enlargement, nodules, or tenderness. The breast will be&#xD;
      examined for any enlargement or galactorrhea. Signs of androgen excess will be looked for&#xD;
      such as; excessive hair growth, acne, or alopecia. Excessive hair growth will be evaluated by&#xD;
      modified Ferriman and Gallwey (Wild et al., 2004) (FG) score(&lt;8 normal,8-15mild hirsutism,&gt;15&#xD;
      moderate/severe hirsutism).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Abdominal examination: including the presence of previous scars, uterine size, any&#xD;
           tenderness, and presence of palpable masses, score on Ferriman Gallway scoring system.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pelvic examination: including uterine size, any adnexal mass, and tenderness, score on&#xD;
           Ferriman Gallway scoring system.&#xD;
&#xD;
           o Investigation:&#xD;
&#xD;
           a) Laboratory (on the 2nd day of cycle):&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Serum testosterone&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Androstenedione&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  AMH&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  LH&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  FSH&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Fasting and 2hrs postprandial b) Imaging -Transvaginal ultrasound(on the 2nd day of&#xD;
           cycle):&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Antral follicular count (AFC)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Ovarian volume&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Endometrial thickness Will be done by the same observer using a Samsung ultrasound&#xD;
           machine, HS40 (TVS probe frequency range 5-7 MHZ). The ovarian volume of each ovary will&#xD;
           be assessed by ellipsoid formula, i.e., 0.52 × D1 (longitudinal) × D2 (oblique) × D3&#xD;
           (transverse) diameters. Mean ovarian volume will be calculated by adding the volume of&#xD;
           both ovaries and then dividing it by 2. A note of ovarian follicles in each ovary will&#xD;
           be also made and a total number of the follicles will be counted by scanning each ovary&#xD;
           from the inner to the outer margin in longitudinal cross-section. Mean follicle number&#xD;
           will be calculated by adding the follicles of both ovaries and then dividing it by 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Method (stair step protocol):&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will be treated with CC starting with 50 mg/day on day 2 of their cycle for 5&#xD;
      days, a transvaginal ultrasound will be done 1 week after the last pill, if all follicles are&#xD;
      below 10 mm the dose will subsequently be increased to 100mg/day for 5 days then 150mg/day&#xD;
      for 5 days if a transvaginal is done a week from the last pill and showed no response (all&#xD;
      follicles being below 10 mm ). The maximum cc dose will be 150 mg (ASRM, 2013).&#xD;
      Medroxyprogesterone (10 mg/d Provera for 10 days)will be given to induce withdrawal bleeding&#xD;
      to start these steps again in a new cycle. These steps will be repeated for 3cycles before&#xD;
      declaring the patient CC resistant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      o Response: Response to CC will be assessed by ovulation. TVS will be done by the same&#xD;
      observer using a Samsung ultrasound machine, HS40.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A scan will be done 1 week after the last pill of each dose. No response: if all follicles&#xD;
      are below 10 mm (ASRM, 2013), follicles &gt;10mm, follow up till ovulation Based on the&#xD;
      ovulation pattern, these patients will be divided into two groups, one who ovulated with CC&#xD;
      maximum 150 mg and others who did not ovulate considered as CC resistant. The patients who&#xD;
      ovulated will be further classified into three subgroups based on whether they ovulated with&#xD;
      50 mg or 100 mg or 150 mg of CC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The various parameters will be compared between the CC-resistant and CC-sensitive groups.&#xD;
