      The main objective of the SCOTT project is to reduce tobacco experimentation of teenagers&#xD;
      through an online intervention based on social networking and empowerment of users.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific objectives of this emerging project are : 1. To develop or identify an online&#xD;
      community dedicated to teenagers where the investigators will develop anti-smoking skills and&#xD;
      norms. It will be based on social cognitive theory and will combine multiple functionalities&#xD;
      based on the current practices and preferences of adolescents on internet and mobile;&#xD;
      ensuring user safety, regulatory and ethical issues ; 2. To analyse the adoption, acceptance&#xD;
      and the usability of SCOTT among users in a limited scale 3.To develop SCOTT process and&#xD;
      impact assessment methodology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research hypothesis Providing access to prevention in an online community will: 1) Strengthen&#xD;
      anti-smoking skills 2) Enhance the empowerment of users 3) Allow the implementation of health&#xD;
      interventions 4) Improve indicators of tobacco consumption in young people Methods The&#xD;
      overall methodology of the project relies on a multidisciplinary approach with a consortium&#xD;
      of French experts in public health (health promotion and epidemiology), education science,&#xD;
      information and communication technologies, medical informatics, adolescent medicine,&#xD;
      adolescent addictology, social sciences, ethics and law. The project will be led in 3 parts:&#xD;
      1) Development of the intervention - using the Integrate, Design, Assess, and Share (IDEAS)&#xD;
      framework. Using qualitative methods (individual interview, focus groups), multidisciplinary&#xD;
      team brainstorming, works meeting and quantitative assessment of SCOTT quality; the&#xD;
      investigators will (a) empathize with target users, (b) specify target behavior, (c) ground&#xD;
      in behavioral theory, (d) ideate implementation strategies, (e) prototype potential products,&#xD;
      (f) gather user feedback, (g) build a minimum viable product, 2) Pilot study : (h) SCOTT will&#xD;
      be deploying on a small scale to assess its usability; 3) Development of the large-scale&#xD;
      evaluation protocol - following the recommendations of the Medical Research Council&#xD;
      concerning the evaluation of complex interventions. The investigators will (i) develop, based&#xD;
      on the results of the pilot test, the SCOTT process evaluation methodology, (j) develop the&#xD;
      SCOTT impact / effectiveness evaluation methodology.&#xD;

      Scientific context The SCOTT project stems from the &quot;m-Health&quot; Initiative launched in 2012 by&#xD;
      the WHO and the International Telecommunication Union for the fight against non-communicable&#xD;
      diseases (NCDs). The project is based on: 1) In 2014, in France, a third of high school&#xD;
      students of all ages said they had already had the opportunity to smoke a cigarette. Smoking&#xD;
      cigarettes is multiplied by 5 during the high school years, with one student in two who has&#xD;
      already smoked at least once a cigarette in the last year. 2) In France the rate of computer&#xD;
      equipment is 97% in the 12-17 and 81% have smartphones. Teenagers of 11-14 are 67% to have a&#xD;
      social network account that they used mainly to watch videos, chat with friends and family&#xD;
      and publish and share 3) Essential elements of risk-taking prevention programs for&#xD;
      adolescents have been identified: using social behavior theories; using interactive&#xD;
      skill-building methods, focusing on the social influences that encourage behavior, including&#xD;
      peers and the media; offering multiple-component interventions; including a strong peer&#xD;
      education or support component.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives The main objective of the SCOTT project is to reduce tobacco experimentation of&#xD;
      teenagers through an online intervention based on social networking and empowerment of users.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific objectives of this emerging project are : 1. To develop or identify an online&#xD;
      community dedicated to teenagers where the investogators will develop anti-smoking skills and&#xD;
      norms. It will be based on social cognitive theory and will combine multiple functionalities&#xD;
      based on the current practices and preferences of adolescents on internet and mobile;&#xD;
      ensuring user safety, regulatory and ethical issues ; 2. To analyse the adoption, acceptance&#xD;
      and the usability of SCOTT among users in a limited scale 3.To develop SCOTT process and&#xD;
      impact assessment methodology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research hypothesis Providing access to prevention in an online community will: 1) Strengthen&#xD;
      anti-smoking skills 2) Enhance the empowerment of users 3) Allow the implementation of health&#xD;

      information and communication technologies, medical informatics, adolescent medicine,&#xD;

      on the results of the pilot test, the SCOTT process evaluation methodology, (j) develop the&#xD;
      SCOTT impact / effectiveness evaluation methodology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expected public health impact Risk behaviors that appear in adolescence explain 17% of the&#xD;
      total burden of disease -mainly non-communicable diseases. With SCOTT young people will gain&#xD;
      greater control of their state of health and well-being through proactive, participatory and&#xD;
      informative aspects of our project. Empowerment and acquisition of resilience skills will&#xD;
      minimise the risk factors of risk behaviors, especially smoking.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Perspectives 1. To deploy and evaluate at the national level SCOTT's effectiveness in&#xD;
      reducing experimentation and regular tobacco use among college students 2. To use data for&#xD;
      public health research on adolescents' health and well-being in order to strengthen research&#xD;
      towards e-health and m-health evidence using data collected from the platform and by the&#xD;
      implementation of surveys and interventional studies.&#xD;
