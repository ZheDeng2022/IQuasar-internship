  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of BGB-11417&#xD;
      monotherapy, define the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) or maximum administered dose and the&#xD;
      recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) of BGB-11417 monotherapy for the selected B-cell malignancy&#xD;
      dose finding cohorts, and evaluate the safety and tolerability of the ramp-up dosing schedule&#xD;
      in the evaluated disease types.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will have 3 cohorts for determining a monotherapy MTD and ramp-up schedule: Cohort&#xD;
      A, participants with relapsed/refractory B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (R/R NHL); Cohort B,&#xD;
      participants with R/R chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma (CLL/SLL) with&#xD;
      low tumor burden; Cohort C, participants with R/R CLL/SLL with high tumor burden.&#xD;

             cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Underlying medical conditions that, in the investigator's opinion, will render the&#xD;
             administration of study drug hazardous or obscure the interpretation of safety or&#xD;
             efficacy results.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Known central nervous system involvement by lymphoma/leukemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
