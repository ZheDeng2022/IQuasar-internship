  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aging process tends to promote an overall increase in inflammation compromising the&#xD;
      immunologic system regulation, sleep/wakefulness pattern, and neurocognitive performance. In&#xD;
      elders, there is an increase in repetitive arousals during sleep, secondary to breathing&#xD;
      interruption by pharynx collapse, generating a transient reduction in oxygen delivery to the&#xD;
      brain known as obstructive sleep apnea. This lack in oxygen supply results in an inflammatory&#xD;
      process producing brain damage. Some substances present in the blood seem to be associated to&#xD;
      neurocognitive damage, like S100β protein, cortisol, interleukin 1-β,6 and TNF-α. In the&#xD;
      other way, a substance called brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) enhances cognitive&#xD;
      function, and memory consolidation improvement.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      An intermittent hypoxia in obstructive sleep apnea induces the production of reactive oxygen&#xD;
      species (ROS), oxidative damage and inflammation generating pro-inflammatory cytokines,&#xD;
      reactive gliosis and neuronal damage. The increase in oxidative damage seems to be associated&#xD;
      to age, contributing to the progress of neurodegeneration. Transient hypoxemia leads to&#xD;
      autonomic excitation causing hyperactivity of the sympathetic nervous system (SNS), and&#xD;
      activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, causing immunological changes&#xD;
      and increased risk of damage to mental functions. Night awakenings caused by OSA are&#xD;
      associated with changes on the HPA axis, resulting in increased serum cortisol levels. The&#xD;
      fluctuation in serum cortisol levels at night is intrinsically related to sleep, and&#xD;
      increases with advancing age. BDNF is responsible for increasing the growth of neurites, and&#xD;
      synaptogenesis, preventing programmed cell death in adults, and is involved in stress&#xD;
      responses on the HPA axis. Low BDNF levels are associated to cognitive impairment, less&#xD;
      memory consolidation, depression, and OSA. There is a positive correlation between levels of&#xD;
      BDNF and cortisol related to physiological regulation of brain activities. The increase in&#xD;
      oxidative damage caused by intermittent hypoxia during obstructive sleep apnea increases&#xD;
      serum levels of the s100β protein promoting reactive gliosis or astrogliosis being associated&#xD;
      to depression in the elderly. Obstructive sleep apnea syndrome is associated with development&#xD;
      of cardiovascular and neurological diseases by activating pro-inflammatory pathways. However,&#xD;
      in elderly individuals, regardless of other specific pathologies, they already have a&#xD;
      pro-inflammatory state secondary to loss of regulation of the immune system.&#xD;

    <measure>Neurocognitive Damage</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Neurocognitive damage will be measured by the Mini Mental State Examination adapted for the Brazilian population. The maximum score for this scale is 30 points, indicating better cognitive performance. A score of 0-9 points indicates severe cognitive loss; 10-20 points of moderate cognitive loss; 21-26 points mild cognitive loss, 27-30 points without cognitive loss.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Depression</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Depression will be measured by the Beck Depression Inventory. A score of 0-9 points indicates that the individual is not depressed; 10-18 points mild depression; 19-29 points moderate depression; 30-36 points severe depression.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Quality of life Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Quality of life will be measured using the World Health Organization's Quality of Life questionnaire, which has assessments in the domains: physical, psychological, social relations and the environment. The evaluation of each domain is expressed as a percentage, where the higher the result (100%) indicates the better quality of life in the respective domain. The general quality of life is given by the average of the scores of the four domains, whose scores vary from 0 to 5 points. 1-2.9 points the quality of life needs to improve; 3-3.9 regular quality of life; 4-4.9 good quality of life; 5 very good quality of life.</description>
