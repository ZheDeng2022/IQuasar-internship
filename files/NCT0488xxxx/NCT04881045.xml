  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a first-in-human, Phase 1, open label, multicenter, multiple dose, dose escalation&#xD;
      and dose expansion study intended to evaluate the safety, pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamic&#xD;
      and potential clinical benefit of PF-07257876, a CD47-PD-L1 bispecific antibody, in&#xD;
      participants with selected advanced or metastatic tumors for whom no standard therapy is&#xD;
      available. The study contains 2 parts, single agent Dose Escalation (Part 1) to determine the&#xD;
      recommended dose of PF-07257876, followed by Dose Expansion (Part 2) in selected tumor types&#xD;
      at the recommended dose.&#xD;
