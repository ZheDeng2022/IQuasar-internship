  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Healthcare workers and COVID-19 patients may experience psychological distress consequent to&#xD;
      the pandemic, and are at particularly elevated risk for experiencing posttraumatic stress&#xD;
      disorder (PTSD), based on evidence from previous infectious disease outbreaks. The&#xD;
      best-validated treatment for PTSD is exposure therapy. Exposure therapy help patients&#xD;
      suffering from PTSD to revisit and overcome their traumatic experiences. Including virtual&#xD;
      reality in exposure therapy has a long history in treating PTSD; and has been used to treat&#xD;
      military veterans and first-responders following 9/11. The investigators are developing and&#xD;
      testing a virtual reality platform to be used in treating healthcare workers and COVID-19&#xD;
      patients who develop PTSD resulting from their experiences in the COVID-19 pandemic.&#xD;
      Participants will complete ten ninety minute sessions, twice a week for five weeks aimed at&#xD;
      mitigating their symptoms of PTSD. The pilot study will aim to demonstrate the feasibility&#xD;
      and the tolerability of the virtual reality intervention in these populations.&#xD;

    <measure>Change in score on the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to approximately five weeks</time_frame>
    <description>24 item self-report measure. 19 questions are evaluated. Each item in the scale is rated between 0 (no distress) and 3 (serious distress). The total PSQI score ranges from 0-21. Sleep quality of the patients with a total score of 5 and below is considered &quot;good&quot;. A score of greater than 5 refers to poor sleep quality.</description>
