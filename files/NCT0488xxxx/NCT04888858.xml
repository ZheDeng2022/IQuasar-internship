  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There are multiple factors that determine progress of normal vaginal delivery. Frequency,&#xD;
      duration and strength of uterine contractions are important for progress throughout labor,&#xD;
      and abdominal wall muscle contractions contribute to progress during the final stage.&#xD;
      Epidural analgesia helps to alleviate the pain associated with uterine contractions, this&#xD;
      however this comes at the expense of prolonging labor by reducing the strength of abdominal&#xD;
      wall muscle contractions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this prospective study is to quantify how much epidurals decrease the strength&#xD;
      of abdominal wall contractions. Intraabdominal pressure will be used as surrogate to strength&#xD;
      of abdominal wall contractions, and it will be measured via a foley catheter inserted into&#xD;
      the urinary bladder as part of standard procedure for patients receiving labor epidurals. We&#xD;
      will compare the change in intraabdominal pressure when patients perform forceful abdominal&#xD;
      contractions (valsalva maneuvers) prior to and during epidural analgesia. This will lay the&#xD;
      foundation for a future study in which we plan to compare the effects of different epidural&#xD;
      analgesia types and concentrations on abdominal wall muscle contractions.&#xD;

    <description>All subjects will be given epidural analgesia to treat their labor pain. As part of standard protocol for all patients who receive a labor epidural, the epidural will then be tested using 3ml of 1.5% lidocaine and 1:200,000 epinephrine test solution, and the epidural catheter will then be loaded with 10ml of 0.125% bupivacaine solution. The epidural catheter will then be connected to a programmed intermittent epidural bolus pump which will administer 5ml of a 0.125% bupivacaine/2mcg fentanyl solution every 30minutes. The first dose will be given following 30minutes after the loading dose. 30 minutes after loading the loading dose and after the first pump dose has been given, we will assess the VAS pain scores and the level of the analgesic based on decreased sensation to ice.</description>
