  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is a prospective, randomized, one-site therapeutic trial of 15% trichloroacetic&#xD;
      acid (TCA) and 30% salicylic acid peels for rosacea. Two peels will be applied topically 4&#xD;
      weeks apart, and the study will end in 12 weeks. Endpoints include adverse affects within the&#xD;
      first 8 weeks and responses, which will be measured by Investigator Global Assessment (IGA),&#xD;
      a Rosacea Clinical Scorecard, and number of papular plus pustular lesions assessed every 4&#xD;
      weeks up to 12 weeks with high resolution photographs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment Dosage and administration&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Drugs:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Trichloroacetic acid peel (15%) will be applied topically to the face for 2 treatments&#xD;
           at 4 week intervals.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Salicylic acid peel (30%) will be applied topically to the face for 2 treatments at 4&#xD;
           week intervals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Duration of treatment: two single applications 4 weeks apart.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Endpoint: 12 weeks after first chemical peel treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome measures:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  independent objective reviewer scoring of matched photographs before and after treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  number of papular and pustular lesions before and after treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  rosacea-specific patient quality of life survey responses before and after treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Adverse effects such as peeling, redness, scaling, crusting, blister formation, and&#xD;
                hyperpigmentation will be assessed clinical&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Patients with a diagnosis of rosacea will be included. Peels will be performed at no cost to&#xD;
      participants; funding will be supplied by the UT Southwestern Dermatology department. A total&#xD;
      of 20 patients will be consented. At the initial visit, patients will fill out a form with&#xD;
      demographic information as well as a RosaQOL survey about how their rosacea has affected&#xD;
      their quality of life. High-quality photographs of each patient's baseline rosacea will be&#xD;
      taken. The treatment arms of 15% TCA peel and 30% salicylic acid peel will be randomly&#xD;
      assigned to patients, and the topical treatment will be applied to the entire face. The&#xD;
      duration of involvement of each subject from the time of initial consent to final clinical&#xD;
      evaluation will be 12 weeks. There will be a total of 4 clinical visits lasting approximately&#xD;
      30 minutes per visit. Each patient will undergo two chemical peel treatments, with a 4-week&#xD;
      interval between treatments. The first treatment will occur at 0 weeks (first visit). Each&#xD;
      patient will follow up at 4 weeks (second visit) for his or her second chemical peel&#xD;
      treatment. After two treatments, the patient will then follow up at 8 weeks (third visit) and&#xD;
      12 weeks (fourth visit) for evaluation of response to treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the chemical peel treatment, each patient's face will be prepared by cleansing with a&#xD;
      deep cleanser, followed by removal of sebum utilizing either alcohol or acetone as a&#xD;
      degreasing agent, and allowing the skin to dry. These steps help optimize penetration of the&#xD;
      peeling agent. The peeling agent will then be applied uniformly to the face with a 2X2 gauze&#xD;
      pad with the patient in supine position until adequate erythematous response is observed. If&#xD;
      needed, the acidic peeling agent may be neutralized with water. Patients will be instructed&#xD;
      to apply Vaseline and sunscreen to the face daily post-treatment to keep the skin moisturized&#xD;
      and protected from UV radiation until exfoliation is complete, typically within 7-10 days&#xD;
      post-peel.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The outcome measures will include patient quality of life survey responses, independent&#xD;
      objective reviewer scoring of matched photographs, and comparisons of the number of papular&#xD;
      and pustular lesions before and after treatment. At each visit, the total number of papular&#xD;
      and pustular lesions will be recorded. High resolution photographs of both the left and right&#xD;
      sides of the face will be taken at the first visit to serve as each patient's baseline&#xD;
      rosacea. Patients will also be asked to complete the RosaQOL survey at the first clinical&#xD;
      visit. Additional photographs will be taken at all four visits using identical lighting,&#xD;
      positioning, and settings for all patients. Two independent investigators will score matched&#xD;
      photographs of the baseline and treated rosacea at time points 0 weeks, 8 weeks, and 12 weeks&#xD;
      using a scale from 0 to 6. 0 indicates no papules, pustules, residual erythema, or&#xD;
      telangiectasia; 1 indicates rare papules and/or pustules, residual to mild erythema, and mild&#xD;
      to moderate telangiectasia; 2 indicates few papules and/or pustules, mild erythema, and mild&#xD;
      to moderate telangiectasia; 3 indicates a distinct number of papules and/or pustules, mild to&#xD;
      moderate erythema, and mild to moderate telangiectasia; 4 indicates a pronounced number of&#xD;
      papules and/or pustules, moderate erythema, and mild to moderate telangiectasia; 5 indicates&#xD;
      many papules and/or pustules occasionally with large inflamed lesions, moderate erythema, and&#xD;
      moderate telangiectasia; and 6 indicates numerous papules and/or pustules occasionally with&#xD;
      confluent areas of inflamed lesions, moderate or severe erythema, and moderate or severe&#xD;
      telangiectasia16. Independent observer scores will be graded using the same method and same&#xD;
      scale for all patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the 12-week follow up visit, patients will be asked to repeat the RosaQOL survey.&#xD;
      Photographs will be taken, and a final documentation of gross number of papular and pustular&#xD;
      lesions will be recorded.&#xD;
