  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Since the HIV changed its course to the chronic disease, high incidence of metabolic syndrome&#xD;
      both in HIV positive and negative subjects has become an issue. Given the successful&#xD;
      peripheral suppression of HIV after introduction of combined antiretroviral therapy (cART),&#xD;
      comorbidities associated with aging and cognitive functioning, play the main role in the&#xD;
      overall quality of life and adherence to the therapy. Continuous low-level neuroinflammation&#xD;
      results in continuous and diffuse neuronal death or dysfunction leading to a certain level of&#xD;
      neurodegeneration. Additionally, metabolic syndrome contributes to neurodegeneration causing&#xD;
      damage to the brain vasculature and provoking the ischemic incidents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study would be to explore the influence of switching to the INSTI based cART&#xD;
      using neuroimaging biomarkers of inflammation and neurodegeneration. The second aim would be&#xD;
      to monitor these neuroimaging biomarkers in patients receiving INSTI-based cART in a one-year&#xD;
      follow-up period. Additionally, we would compare the markers of metabolic syndrome and&#xD;
      cognitive functioning (executive functions) in HIV-positive patients after switching to&#xD;
      INSTI-based cART and in HIV-positive patients receiving INSTI-based cART from the start.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study represents a single-center, prospective, interventional, two-armed single study.&#xD;
      Arm I will include 60 patients on PI/EFV based ART, stable on treatment, who are switched to&#xD;
      INSTI based regimen at the beginning of the study due to side effects or long-term toxicities&#xD;
      like hyperlipidemia, diarrhea, (PI), insomnia, headache (EFV), high Framingham score&#xD;
      (PI/EFV). Arm II will include 60 patients initially on INSTI-based ART, stable on treatment.&#xD;
      The same data sets will be collected for both groups of patients. The variables collected&#xD;
      will be related to metabolic syndrome (levels of LDL and HDL cholesterol, triglycerides,&#xD;
      fasting insulin, glucose, blood pressure, waist circumference, waist to hip and waist to&#xD;
      height ratio), performance on neurocognitive tests and MR spectroscopy neuroinflammation and&#xD;
      neurodegeneration markers at the beginning of the study, as well as in 12 months follow up.&#xD;
      Presence of steatosis and visceral fat thickness will be assessed using ultrasonography of&#xD;
      abdomen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary imaging will be performed at the time of enrollment of patients, along with the&#xD;
      neurocognitive testing and blood sampling. The secondary imaging (follow up) will be&#xD;
      performed 12 months after the initial, also followed by neurocognitive assessment and blood&#xD;
      sampling.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anthropometric measurements will be acquired at the time of blood sampling. Statistical&#xD;
      analysis will be performed after collecting the data. Our work could significantly contribute&#xD;
      to the better life quality in the aging of HIV positive subjects in the domain of cognitive&#xD;
      functioning, tightly associated with adherence and overall life quality.&#xD;

      Serbia is low income country with epidemiology of HIV infection resembling those in developed&#xD;
      countries, with average age of patients around 50 years and majority of them being the MSM&#xD;
      population. Another important issue is the high incidence of metabolic syndrome both in HIV&#xD;
      positive and negative subjects. With the successful peripheral suppression of HIV after&#xD;
      introduction of combination antiretroviral therapy (cART), HIV disease has changed its course&#xD;
      and now represents a chronic disease with majority of patients reaching senium. In these&#xD;
      patients, comorbidities associated with aging, especially in the means of cognitive&#xD;
      functioning, play the main role in the overall quality of life and adherence to the therapy.&#xD;
      Considering the fact that viral particles of HIV remain latent in microglial cells and&#xD;
      macrophages, virus only triggers the inflammatory response in the brain, which is afterwards&#xD;
      maintained in the form of low-level neuroinflammation by the microglia and macrophages,&#xD;
      resulting in continuous and diffuse neuronal death or dysfunction and leading to a certain&#xD;
      level of neurodegeneration. With aging of HIV-positive subject, this form of&#xD;
      neurodegeneration is combined with the physiological aging of the brain, most probably in the&#xD;
      synergistic manner. Recent studies showed that this peripheral inflammation alters the&#xD;
      blood-brain barrier and allows the penetration of HIV and particles, starting the &quot;circulus&#xD;
      vitiosus&quot; all over again. Additionally, metabolic syndrome contributes to neurodegeneration&#xD;
      causing damage to the brain vasculature and provoking the ischemic incidents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The switch from the old fashion to the modern INSTI based cART and its influence on the&#xD;
      process of neurodegeneration, as well as the role of neuroprotection of INSTI are still not&#xD;
      well examined and documented. The aim of this study would be to explore the influence of&#xD;
      switching to the INSTI based cART on neuroimaging biomarkers of inflammation and&#xD;
      neurodegeneration obtained by MRS. The second aim would be to monitor these neuroimaging&#xD;
      biomarkers in patients receiving INSTI based cART from the start in a one-year follow up&#xD;
      period. Additionally, we would compare the markers of metabolic syndrome and cognitive&#xD;
      functioning (executive functions) in HIV-positive patients after switching to INSTI based&#xD;
      cART and in HIV-positive patients receiving INSTI based cART from the start.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study represents a single-center, prospective, interventional, two-armed single study.&#xD;
      Arm I will include 60 patients on PI/EFV based ART, stable on treatment, who will be switched&#xD;
      to INSTI based regimen at the beginning of the study due to side effects or long-term&#xD;
      toxicities like hyperlipidemia, diarrhea, (PI), insomnia, headache (EFV), high Framingham&#xD;
      score (PI/EFV). Arm II will include 60 patients initially started on INSTI based ART, stable&#xD;
      on treatment. The same data set will be collected in both groups of patients. The variables&#xD;
      collected will be related to metabolic syndrome (levels of LDL and HDL cholesterol,&#xD;
      triglycerides, fasting insulin, glucose, blood pressure, waist circumference, waist to hip&#xD;
      and waist to height ratio), performance on neurocognitive tests and MRS neuroinflammation and&#xD;
      neurodegeneration markers at the beginning of the study, as well as the 12 months after the&#xD;
      beginning.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Besides the biochemical and anthropometric parameters of metabolic syndrome, presence of&#xD;
      steatosis and visceral fat thickness will be assessed using ultrasonography of abdomen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary imaging will be performed at the time of enrollment of patients. At the same time&#xD;
      point, immediately before of after the imaging, patients will fulfill the neurocognitive&#xD;
      testing. Blood samples will be taken within one week prior to imaging. The secondary imaging&#xD;
      (follow up) will be performed 12 months after the initial, also followed by neurocognitive&#xD;
      assessment in the same time relationship. Blood samples will be taken within one week prior&#xD;
      to imaging.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anthropometric measurements will be acquired at the time of blood sampling. Adequate&#xD;
      statistical analysis will be performed after collecting the data. Our work could&#xD;
      significantly contribute to the better life quality in the aging of HIV positive subjects in&#xD;
      the domain of cognitive functioning, tightly associated with adherence and overall life&#xD;
      quality.&#xD;
