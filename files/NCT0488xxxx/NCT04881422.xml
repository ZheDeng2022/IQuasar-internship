  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Only a limited percentage of persons with MS (pwMS) participate to multidisciplinary&#xD;
      rehabilitation because of poor support, knowledge and motivation. The investigators reasoned&#xD;
      that pwMS should be more effectively prepared to increase their adherence. This study propose&#xD;
      the implementation of an innovative collaborative approach, called &quot;brief high-impact&#xD;
      preparatory experience&quot; (b-HIPE), inspired by an overarching model based on the interplay&#xD;
      between competence, motivation and opportunity to increase in a short time awareness and&#xD;
      motivation of pwMS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the study is the evaluation of its feasibility. For this pilot study the&#xD;
      investigator chose a single-group design with repeated measurements at baseline and post&#xD;
      intervention.&#xD;
