  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The majority of people with diabetes worldwide consist of type 2 diabetes mellitus.&#xD;
      Typically, patients with type 2 diabetes are encouraged to manage their condition with weight&#xD;
      loss; healthy eating; regular exercise; blood glucose monitoring; and in some cases, diabetes&#xD;
      medication or insulin therapy. However, many struggle with their condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pulsed Electromagnetic Frequency (PEMF) devices, which follow similar principles as a TENS&#xD;
      machine, emit electromagnetic fields and are proposed to provide a non-invasive, safe, and&#xD;
      easy-to-use method for treatment and management of diabetes related symptoms such as pain,&#xD;
      alongside existing treatments and interventions. There is a belief that such devices may&#xD;
      promote health and wellbeing and as a result could improve outcomes of type 2 diabetes. The&#xD;
      use of the PEMF device would not replace existing treatments, interventions, or any primary&#xD;
      care that the participants are currently receiving.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of a PEMF device of this kind for&#xD;
      reported symptoms such as pain, fatigue, and overall wellbeing in people with type 2&#xD;
      diabetes. The study also seeks to explore patients' experiences of using the PEMF device.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Type 2 diabetes is highly prevalent and many sufferers struggle with their condition. One&#xD;
      symptom of type 2 diabetes is diabetic neuropathy, which is characterised by progressive pain&#xD;
      and loss of sensation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pulsed Electromagnetic Frequency (PEMF) devices, which follow similar principles as a TENS&#xD;
      machine, emit electromagnetic fields and are proposed to provide a non-invasive, safe, and&#xD;
      easy-to-use method for treatment and management of pain alongside existing treatments and&#xD;
      interventions. A recent systematic review reported that pulsed electromagnetic fields had&#xD;
      high efficacy in reducing musculoskeletal pain and that methods were well tolerated and had&#xD;
      no negative side effects. Research established that pulsed electromagnetic field therapy had&#xD;
      beneficial effects on pain, stiffness, and physical function in patients with osteoarthritis.&#xD;
      It has, however, been recommended that further research is conducted to examine the use and&#xD;
      effectiveness of pulsed electromagnetic field methods.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Given the findings reported regarding the effectiveness of pulsed electromagnetic field&#xD;
      methods in reducing pain, it is possible that such devices could prove effective in managing&#xD;
      diabetes related symptoms such as pain. It would also be useful to provide insight on the&#xD;
      claim that they could potentially improve outcomes of type 2 diabetes and benefit users&#xD;
      overall wellbeing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is a pragmatic study as it is considered a better reflection of the perceived&#xD;
      clinical benefits in a real world setting as opposed to being more efficacious in a trial&#xD;
      setting. Pragmatic studies answer questions such as whether there is perceived additional&#xD;
      clinical benefit where a treatment is utilised alongside usual care. This can then determine&#xD;
      whether there is reason to explore this matter further and conduct a placebo-controlled trial&#xD;
      to further inform health professionals and clinical guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study, therefore, is to evaluate the effectiveness of a pulsed&#xD;
      electromagnetic field (PEMF) device for managing pain, health and wellbeing issues associated&#xD;
      with type 2 diabetes via a pragmatic study. The study also seeks to explore patients'&#xD;
      experiences of using the device.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To evaluate the effectiveness of the PEMF device for symptoms associated with type 2&#xD;
           diabetes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To evaluate the effectiveness of the PEMF device for quality of life in patients with&#xD;
           type 2 diabetes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To explore type 2 diabetes patients' experiences of using the PEMF device.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a mixed methods study containing quantitative questionnaires and some qualitative&#xD;
      interviews. All methods are non-evasive. The target population will be a heterogeneous and&#xD;
      demographically diverse group of patients with type 2 diabetes meeting the inclusion&#xD;
      criteria. Patients will be aged 18 years and over with a diagnosis of type 2 diabetes.&#xD;
      Patients must be willing to participate, be able to read and write in English, and be able to&#xD;
      give full, informed, written consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be recruited from patient support groups for adults with type 2 diabetes. In&#xD;
      addition, the screening process will exclude those ineligible for inclusion. Responses to an&#xD;
      on-line link will highlight the particulars of those interested in participating. Research&#xD;
      staff will email an invitation letter to selected respondents (as per the study inclusion&#xD;
      criteria ) with type 2 diabetes, together with a screening questionnaire, a patient&#xD;
      information sheet and a consent form. Those who indicate they are interested in participating&#xD;
      will be further contacted by the research team.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Consenting participants will be randomised into either the PEMF device group or the waiting&#xD;
      list control group. There will be 30 participants in the PEMF group and 30 in the waiting&#xD;
      list control group. The trial period of device use will last 3 months. Participants will be&#xD;
      asked to use the PEMF device for 30 minutes per day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study outcome measures will assess diabetes symptoms and quality of life, and will be&#xD;
      completed at baseline and at the end of the study intervention. All questionnaire tools have&#xD;
      been previously validated. The Interview schedule will be piloted prior to use. Outcome&#xD;
      measures consist of the following validated instruments: the Appraisal of Diabetes Scale&#xD;
      (ADS), Measure Yourself Medical Outcome Profile (MYMOP)2, and the EQ-5D-5L tool to determine&#xD;
      health related quality of life.The outcome measures will be collected at baseline, 6-weeks, 3&#xD;
      months plus a 6 month follow up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be asked to complete a patient diary throughout the duration of the trial.&#xD;
      The diary will ask participants to indicate use of study interventions, use of prescribed and&#xD;
      non-prescribed treatments, and use of NHS services during the course of the trial. The diary&#xD;
      will additionally record details of any changes to participants' food consumption during the&#xD;
      trial period, device usage, and any routine blood glucose monitoring.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sociodemographic and treatment characteristics will be obtained from a participants&#xD;
      demographics questionnaire. These will include gender, age, educational level, marital&#xD;
      status, and diabetes treatment received and dosage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be invited to send the study team any clinical result sheets from&#xD;
      participants' routine care. Such results routinely include glycated haemoglobin level (HbA1c)&#xD;
      systolic/diastolic blood pressure, total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol&#xD;
      (LDL), high density lipoproteins (HDL), and triglycerides. Any such information will be&#xD;
      analysed and where appropriate help to address the research questions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      No restrictions will be placed on the care provided by healthcare professionals treating&#xD;
      participants but use of prescribed and non-prescribed treatments will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Members of the PEMF device group will be invited to qualitative on-line focus groups or&#xD;
      interviews. Participants will also be asked to participate in focus groups to explore their&#xD;
      experiences of using the PEMF device, including participants' perceptions on how the device&#xD;
      could be improved, any perceived impact on their diabetes and quality of life, and any&#xD;
      adverse effects. Focus groups were chosen as the data-gathering method of choice, as the&#xD;
      interaction helps participants to explore and refine their own experiences and perspectives.&#xD;
      Two members of the research team will jointly conduct each focus group. The focus groups will&#xD;
      be directed by a topic guide. Topic guides will be updated throughout the study to&#xD;
      incorporate emerging themes. Focus groups will take place 3 months after the initiation of&#xD;
      the PEMF intervention. Up to 5 focus groups will take place with patients using the PEMF&#xD;
      device. Focus groups will be audio-recorded and transcribed verbatim.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The PEMF devices will be delivered to the homes of participants and all measures involve&#xD;
      self-reporting to be conducted at participants' own homes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Project milestones:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Milestone 1: Pre-study preparation (2 months)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  produce study documents (information sheets, consent forms)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  obtain ethical approval&#xD;
&#xD;
      Milestone 2: Recruitment/ data collection (6 months)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  recruitment of 60 patients to the study&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  obtain all baseline and follow-up outcome measures&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  complete all focus groups&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  mid-term report to study funders&#xD;
&#xD;
      Milestone 3: Data analysis (2 months)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  statistical analysis of data from outcome measures&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  analysis of data from qualitative focus groups&#xD;
&#xD;
      Milestone 4: Dissemination&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  end of study report to funders&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  dissemination of findings to participants&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  dissemination through conferences and peer reviewed journal articles&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data analysis-&#xD;
&#xD;
      Quantitative data- Appropriate descriptive statistics will be estimated for all baseline&#xD;
      sociodemographic and clinical variables by arm, and for outcome variables (scores on). The&#xD;
      association between baseline sociodemographic or clinical variables and outcome variables&#xD;
      will be assessed using appropriate between-group tests or correlations depending on skewness.&#xD;
      Primary outcome variables will be compared between the arms using t-tests, one-way analysis&#xD;
      of variance, Mann-Whitney tests and Kruskal-Wallis tests, bearing in mind any skewness in the&#xD;
      data. Data will also evaluate the impact of medication on outcome, comparing treatment&#xD;
      outcomes from those on diabetic medication compared to those not currently receiving&#xD;
      medication for their diabetes. An intention-to-treat analysis model will be followed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Qualitative data- Data will be analysed inductively, using thematic analysis. One of the&#xD;
      researchers will immerse themselves in the data, repeatedly reading the transcripts to&#xD;
      understand participants' experiences. Key issues, concepts and themes arising from the data&#xD;
      will be identified to create a coding framework. Transcripts will then be coded and analysed&#xD;
      thematically.&#xD;

    <description>Appraisal of Diabetes Scale (ADS): The ADS is a brief 7-item patient-reported scale that assesses the impact of diabetes on a patient's life. The items, which were developed based on theory and previous research, include &quot;How upsetting is having diabetes for you?&quot; and &quot;To what degree does your diabetes get in the way of your developing life goals?&quot;. The instrument has been shown to have acceptable internal consistency reliability, test-retest reliability, and construct validity. Higher scores indicate greater negative impact of diabetes.</description>
