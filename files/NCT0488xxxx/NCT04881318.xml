    <textblock>
      Compression Garments are a commonly prescribed treatment in Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia&#xD;
      Syndrome (POTS). The effectiveness of a proof-of-concept compression garment has been&#xD;
      demonstrated in an acute laboratory setting. It is not known if commercially available&#xD;
      compression garments that participants wear in their every day lives are effective at&#xD;
      improving heart rate and reducing symptoms in POTS. This trial will evaluate the use of&#xD;
      commercially available waist-high and abdominal compression garments in adults diagnosed with&#xD;
      POTS in a community setting.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Current treatment of Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome (POTS) involves&#xD;
      pharmacological and non-pharmacological intervention including salt and fluid loading,&#xD;
      exercise, physical countermanuevers, and compression garments. Lower extremity compression&#xD;
      garments provide mechanical external pressure to the blood vessels in the legs, thighs and&#xD;
      abdomen, shifting blood back to the central circulation to increase preload and stroke&#xD;
      volume. With increased stroke volume, cardiac output is maintained without excessive&#xD;
      tachycardia. Compression garments are commonly prescribed as a non-pharmacological treatment&#xD;
      in POTS, but previously little evidence validated their use. A recent proof-of-concept&#xD;
      compression garment study performed by our research lab demonstrated significant HR and&#xD;
      symptom reductions with compression, with adult POTS patients in an acute laboratory setting.&#xD;
      The effectiveness of commercially available compression garments in a community setting in&#xD;
      POTS patients is not known.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, the researchers will use commercially or medically (by prescription) available&#xD;
      waist-high compression garments (WHC) that POTS patients use in their daily life, to evaluate&#xD;
      compression as a viable long-term treatment option. Additionally, the researchers will&#xD;
      perform an optional sub-study of abdominal compression garments (AC), evaluating their&#xD;
      effectiveness. Results from this study will be used to inform the practicality and&#xD;
      effectiveness of compression garments in the community setting. These findings could rapidly&#xD;
      translate to the clinical setting and improve patient care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Hypothesis: Body compression with commercially available WHC will acutely reduce&#xD;
      orthostatic tachycardia, when compared to no compression, in a community setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sub-Study Hypothesis: Body compression with commercially available AC will acutely reduce&#xD;
      orthostatic tachycardia, when compared to no compression, in a community setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participant will complete the study in a community setting. The participant will be&#xD;
      provided with the study supplies including a Holter monitor to wear during the study. The&#xD;
      duration of the study will be up to 4 days in total. The &quot;With Medications&quot; phase is 2 days&#xD;
      and the &quot;Without Medications&quot; phase is 2 days. The first randomization is whether to do the&#xD;
      WHC studies first after medications have been held for at least 24h or without holding the&#xD;
      medications. If the participant will be in the AC Sub-Studies, then they will do those&#xD;
      studies during the same window of holding medications (or not) as the WHC study. The second&#xD;
      randomization would determine the order of WHC-AC vs. AC-WHC during each window&#xD;
&#xD;
      For each study day, there will be a total of 4 standing tests. Participants will first put on&#xD;
      the Holter monitor at the beginning of the study day. The first standing test (OVS #1) will&#xD;
      be performed 30 minutes after the participant takes their medications but before putting on&#xD;
      the compression garment. The participant will then put on the compression garment. The second&#xD;
      (OVS #2) standing test will be performed 30 minutes after putting on the compression garment.&#xD;
      The third (OVS #3) standing test will be performed a minimum of 3 hours after putting on the&#xD;
      compression garment. After a minimum of 3hours, the participant will then remove the&#xD;
      compression garment. The fourth standing test (OVS #4) will be performed 30 minutes after&#xD;
      removing the garment. Participants will record their symptoms after each standing test, as&#xD;
      well as medications taken each day in the provided study booklet.&#xD;
