    <textblock>
      This is a randomized clinical trial, in which the use of an Adjustable compression wrap as a&#xD;
      compressive therapy to control the upper limb volume of with lymphedema women secondary to&#xD;
      breast cancer will be investigated, in comparison to the use of a compression sleeve&#xD;
      conventionally used. It is expected that Adjustable compression wrap will be more effective&#xD;
      than standard treatment for the control of lymphedema, in addition to promoting a better&#xD;
      quality of life and functionality for women.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized clinical trial of medical devices in pivotal stage, simple blind, which&#xD;
      aims to evaluate the effectiveness of the use of adjustable compression wrap in controlling&#xD;
      the volume of the upper limb of women with lymphedema secondary to breast cancer. It will be&#xD;
      carried out in a reference hospital in the treatment of breast cancer in Brazil, with&#xD;
      inclusion scheduled for June 2021 and follow-up of up to 1 year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All volunteers must have stabilized lymphedema in the upper limb secondary to breast cancer&#xD;
      and, therefore indicated phase 2 of compressive therapy. According to the sample calculation&#xD;
      will be needed72 women to be randomly randomized in a 1: 1 ratio between the experimental&#xD;
      intervention group (n = 36) and the standard intervention group (n = 36).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Intervention consists of compressive therapy in the control phase for lymphedema&#xD;
      secondary to breast cancer, in which the Experimental Intervention Group will receive a&#xD;
      Adjustable compression wrap (Read Wrap®) while the Standard Intervention Group will receive a&#xD;
      standard compressive sleeve for use in the upper limb with lymphedema, according to the&#xD;
      institutional routine. The institutional protocol for the lymphedema control phase will be&#xD;
      respected, in which the orthosis is used at home for the longest possible period, with only&#xD;
      removal for bathing and sleeping; furthermore, skin care and therapeutic exercises for the&#xD;
      upper limbs must be performed daily. One guidance booklet and home exercises of the&#xD;
      institutional routine will be delivered . During the initial 30 days of treatment, all study&#xD;
      participants will be able to be accompanied by a telephone channel that will be provided for&#xD;
      questions, guidance and communications of adverse events, in addition to a therapeutic diary&#xD;
      that will be delivered at the first appointment and collected after this period, designed to&#xD;
      notify relevant information that they consider about the use of compressive therapy such as&#xD;
      facilities, difficulties and time of use, symptoms related to the arm and adverse effects&#xD;
      that may arise, and to monitor adherence to exercises.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The suspension of treatment before the anticipated end of therapy will occur when adverse&#xD;
      effects are observed, such as an increase in the volume of the limb greater than 10% of the&#xD;
      last measurement, signs of dermatitis, skin infections or allergy. The case will be evaluated&#xD;
      by the physiotherapy team and, when necessary, by the medical team and the necessary&#xD;
      procedures will be adopted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection will take place through the analysis of physical and electronic medical&#xD;
      records, interviews and physical examination. The interviews will consist of questionnaires&#xD;
      produced by the researchers, in addition to validated questionnaires for the brazilian&#xD;
      population. The evaluations will take place in the outpatient clinic of the physiotherapy&#xD;
      service of the hospital on the 1st and 30th day of the intervention for immediate evaluation,&#xD;
      and will be followed up until 1 years later, to verify the long-term outcome measures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The analysis of the data will be descriptive and comparative of the intervention groups, in&#xD;
      relation to the selected variables and the main outcomes, through the analysis of measures of&#xD;
      central tendency, dispersion and frequency distribution. Outcome assessment will be performed&#xD;
      by intention to treat, using linear and logistic regression, simple and multiple. For all&#xD;
      analyzes the 95% confidence interval will be considered.&#xD;

    <description>Ultrasonography is used, a non-invasive method of capturing images of tissues through the emission of ultrasonic waves, through the evaluation of images obtained by the portable device, it will be possible to characterize the alteration of the dermoepidermal complex and the tissue. subcutaneous tissue of the upper limb with lymphedema. The report will be provided by a professional with experience in using the kinesiological ultrasound method.</description>

    <time_frame>The tissue temperature of the arm will be before (1st day), 30 days, 6 months and 1 year after enrollment.</time_frame>
    <description>The tempertature of the arm will be assessed by means of thermography. Thermography is a safe, non-invasive imaging method that determines the distribution of body surface temperatures according to the physiological and pathological condition of the tissues. Inflammation, metabolic changes in the subcutaneous tissue and changes in blood supply result in changes in the temperature gradient of the affected area. In this way, the different stages of lymphedema will be related to different patterns of temperature distribution. The body surface temperatures will be recorded by means of a thermal camera and will be taken in the orthostatic position, from the anterior and posterior portions of the limb, at a distance of 2m. Later, these thermometric images will be analyzed using proprietary software. The standard measurement used will be in degrees celsius (ºC).</description>
