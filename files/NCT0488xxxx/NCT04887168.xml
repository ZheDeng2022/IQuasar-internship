  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Previous research has concluded that prison populations have particularly high rates of&#xD;
      interpersonal trauma. There is however concern that these issues have been largely overlooked&#xD;
      and misunderstood in the work undertaken with male offenders. The importance of addressing&#xD;
      these concerns can be seen in the greater occurrence of mental health problems and higher&#xD;
      reconviction rates often reported by prisoners with histories of interpersonal trauma. This&#xD;
      study seeks to investigate complex trauma and associated symptomatology can be effectively&#xD;
      ameliorated and whether differences in delivery intensity impact on how interventions respond&#xD;
      most effectively to this group of survivors' needs. This is particularly relevant for&#xD;
      forensic mental health services located in prisons, which are tasked with the care and&#xD;
      rehabilitation of large populations of survivors.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Central to this study will be the use of non-randomised control design whereby all&#xD;
      participants will receive treatment at the trial sites they are currently located at. The&#xD;
      sites will deliver the intervention at different intensities either weekly (ie 'spaced') or&#xD;
      twice weekly ('compressed'). As such the trial design is a pragmatic response to the&#xD;
      resources made available to facilitate this trial. A sample of n = 196 male prisoners with a&#xD;
      history of complex interpersonal trauma will be drawn from the 2 participating UK prison&#xD;
      establishments. Participants will be initially identified by routine 'generic' and mental&#xD;
      health assessments that consider a range of social, health and offending behaviour related&#xD;
      needs. Those prisoners whose prior assessments indicate a history of childhood or adulthood&#xD;
      trauma will be invited to participate in a one-off interview. Information during interviews&#xD;
      will be collected by means of standardised questionnaires regarding the nature and extent of&#xD;
      lifetime traumatic events and current psychopathology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All trial participants will continue their usual psychological, psychiatric, and medical care&#xD;
      during the study. Data collection interviews will be carried out in designated interview&#xD;
      areas within the prison or any other suitable place of their choosing. All interviews will be&#xD;
      conducted by a research assistant, who will have experience in working with adults with&#xD;
      complex trauma and mental health concerns.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Psychoeducational Intervention: Survive &amp; Thrive (S&amp;T). The 'present focussed' group format&#xD;
      is designed to be part of the process of stabilisation of clients presenting difficulties&#xD;
      prior to embarking on work with the traumatic elements of their experiences. Survive &amp; Thrive&#xD;
      was designed to help clients achieve stabilisation in a resource efficient way, while at the&#xD;
      same time providing service users with support while they are on waiting lists to access&#xD;
      further treatment. The focus of this intervention is therefore primarily on ensuring safety,&#xD;
      stabilisation and affect management skills.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 10 manualised sessions of approximately 1.5 hour duration are offered. Individual&#xD;
      sessions run using an educational format and in an informal setting, with a strong emphasis&#xD;
      on avoiding individual disclosures. Groups will be delivered utilising a multi-disciplinary&#xD;
      work force consisting of mental health staff in a ratio of 2 per group. Groups will consist&#xD;
      of a maximum of 8-10 participants per group and whilst they will be randomly selected in&#xD;
      accordance with the procedure outlined about a local treatment manager (psychology manager)&#xD;
      will ensure that issues all security concerns and group dynamics that might potentially&#xD;
      mitigate the effectiveness of the intervention are accounted for. All professionals who&#xD;
      facilitate the delivery of the programme will have a background in applied psychology or&#xD;
      mental health and will have received standardised three-day training on the delivery of the&#xD;
      intervention and an additional day to account for the adjustments made to S&amp;T to assist with&#xD;
      delivery in this population and setting. Regular supervision will also be provided during the&#xD;
      delivery of the programme.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion Criteria: All convicted male inmates over the age of 18 years old at the trial&#xD;
      sites who indicate a history of interpersonal complex trauma will be invited to participate&#xD;
      in this study. It should be noted that potential participants may present with different&#xD;
      clusters of PTSD and CPTSD symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A completer and an intention to treat analysis will be performed. Irrespective of time of&#xD;
      termination all participants will be invited for an end point blind assessment. Premature&#xD;
      termination due to recovery will be at any time, whilst patients terminating prematurely due&#xD;
      to lack of improvement must complete at least 7 sessions in the study before they can be&#xD;
      classified as completers. A maximum of 10 sessions will be offered as part of the project.&#xD;
      Qualitative and quantitative procedures will analyse resultant data to establish&#xD;
      acceptability of the intervention and the treatment efficacy of differing treatment&#xD;
      intensities.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        All convicted male inmates over the age of 18 years old who indicate a history of&#xD;
        interpersonal complex trauma will be invited to participate in this study. The ITQ will be&#xD;
        used to identify the presence of complex trauma. It should be noted that potential&#xD;
        participants may present with different clusters of PTSD and CPTSD symptoms; it is thought&#xD;
        that this should not compromise the overall integrity of the study (Facer-Irwin et al,&#xD;
        2021). The selection process should also help to ensure:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  An adequate level of mental and physical health and substance misuse stability so as&#xD;
             to enable them to cope with the requirements of the intervention as determined by the&#xD;
             local Multi-disciplinary Mental Health Team (MDMHT).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Willing to participate for therapeutic and rehabilitative reasons and to have&#xD;
             voluntarily given their written consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Serving a sentence of 6-months or more and able to complete all follow up assessments&#xD;
             prior to their liberation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have a sufficient level of literacy skills that will enable them to engage with the&#xD;
             course written material. Learning disabilities or difficulties will be considered on a&#xD;
             case by case basis as discussed with the Treatment Manager.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Located in a mainstream residential location.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        It is intended that as fewer prisoners as possible will be excluded from this study.&#xD;
        Therefore, the following exclusion criteria are primarily based on ensuring the safety or&#xD;
        the individual, other participants/staff and the good order and functioning of the prison&#xD;
        establishment. This should include;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prisoners who present as a high risk of institutional violence and requiring&#xD;
             segregation from mainstream residential units&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Those who are on frequent observations for suicide and self-harm at any time in the&#xD;
             week prior to the intervention starting.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Enemies and those who have formed intimate relationships with each other whilst in&#xD;
             custody will also be allocated to separate groups to ensure appropriate therapeutic&#xD;
             dynamics. This will be undertaken in consultation with staff from establishment&#xD;
             security department.&#xD;
