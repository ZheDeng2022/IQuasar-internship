    <textblock>
      This is a double-blinded, two-arm, phase II study to assess efficacy, safety and tolerability&#xD;
      of DFV890 in participants with symptomatic knee osteoarthritis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study includes a screening period, a treatment period and a follow-up period. At most,&#xD;
      the study duration is 19 weeks.&#xD;
