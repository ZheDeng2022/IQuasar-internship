    <textblock>
      We propose a single-arm clinical trial, with historical controls as a comparison group for&#xD;
      select outcomes. Subjects with MAUD will receive 16 sessions of dual-target theta burst&#xD;
      stimulation to the DLPFC and MPFC over 4 weeks. We will follow outcomes for 12 weeks.&#xD;
      Outcomes include treatment retention, craving, self-reported MA or stimulant use, urine drug&#xD;
      screen results, depressive symptoms, anxiety symptoms, sleep quality, quality of life,&#xD;
      response inhibition, and functional connectivity. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to measure&#xD;
      functional connectivity at baseline and four weeks.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Methamphetamine (MA) use can cause many serious adverse health consequences and is an&#xD;
      important public health issue in Iowa, New Mexico, and Utah. In the 2017 Treatment Episode&#xD;
      Data Set, 26% of substance use disorder treatment admissions from these states involved MA as&#xD;
      the primary substance. MA-involved overdose deaths have been increasingly common in these&#xD;
      states. Treatment for MA use disorder (MAUD) is primarily psychosocial. Rates of treatment&#xD;
      induction and retention are poor, and relapse rates are high. There is a pressing need to&#xD;
      identify effective interventions that enhance psychosocial treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) using either high frequency stimulation or&#xD;
      intermittent theta burst stimulation is a non-invasive brain stimulation technique that&#xD;
      effectively treats major depressive disorder and is considered safe, well-tolerated, and&#xD;
      potent. TMS has increasingly been studied to treat addiction. The dorsolateral prefrontal&#xD;
      cortex (DLPFC), a brain region implicated in regulatory processes related to executive&#xD;
      function, emotion, motivation, and craving, is a common target for TMS. DLPFC stimulation&#xD;
      using high frequency repetitive TMS has reduced craving in many studies of addictive&#xD;
      disorders, including cocaine and MAUD. In addition to the DLPFC target, emerging evidence&#xD;
      indicates that continuous theta burst stimulation (cTBS) delivered to the medial prefontal&#xD;
      cortex (MPFC) during drug cue activation reduced craving and related brain activity in&#xD;
      cocaine users. Despite these encouraging findings, no trials have reported on the efficacy of&#xD;
      TMS for reducing MA use or preventing relapse. Clinical research on TMS for MAUD is sparse in&#xD;
      the United States, and the limited studies of TMS in MAUD have been in experimental or closed&#xD;
      treatment settings where effects on actual MA use are difficult to evaluate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We are proposing a pilot study in 8 people with MAUD engaged in psychosocial treatment to&#xD;
      explore the effects and tolerability of a four-week treatment protocol combining intermittent&#xD;
      theta burst stimulation of the DLPFC with cTBS targeting the MPFC (dual-target TMS). We&#xD;
      expect that this combined approach will enhance executive function and inhibitory control and&#xD;
      reduce craving through separate but related mechanisms. We will evaluate clinical outcomes&#xD;
      including symptoms and substance use, changes in functional connectivity measured via MRI and&#xD;
      their relationship to treatment response, and changes in impulsivity as measured by&#xD;
      performance on a response inhibition task. This project has the following specific aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1: Characterize changes in craving, depressive symptoms, anxiety symptoms, sleep quality,&#xD;
      quality of life, and MA or other stimulant use over four weeks of dual-target TMS and eight&#xD;
      weeks of subsequent follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2: Estimate changes in functional connectivity in the brain and response inhibition and&#xD;
      selective attention in people with MAUD after four weeks of dual-target TMS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 3: Evaluate retention in the study to establish feasibility and tolerability of the&#xD;
      protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 4: Compare retention in psychosocial treatment and positive urine drug screens in study&#xD;
      participants compared to matched historical controls.&#xD;

    <description>TMS treatment will be provided daily for 5 days, then daily for 5 days in week 2, and three times per week (Monday, Wednesday, Friday) in weeks 3 and 4.&#xD;
Treatment targeting will occur at the Beam F3 and FP1 scalp regions as defined by the 10-20 EEG system and previous publications. A Magventure MagPro X100 figure-8 coil with theta burst capabilities will be used to deliver the stimulus, including intermittent theta burst stimulation to the DLPFC (2 seconds of 50-Hz triplets delivered at 5 Hz, 8 seconds intertrain interval, 600 total pulses) and continuous theta burst to the MPFC (continuous 50-Hz stimulation triplets, 600 pulses). Stimulation will be delivered at 110% of the resting motor threshold.</description>
