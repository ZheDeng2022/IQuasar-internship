  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center phase II clinical trial to evaluate the anti-tumor activity and safety&#xD;
      of HX009 in subjects with advanced solid tumors.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The present study is comprised of two parts: the efficacy estimation part and the key phase&#xD;
      II part. In the first part, subjects with unresectable locally advanced or metastatic solid&#xD;
      tumors (confirmed by histology or pathology) will be enrolled. Tumor types of special&#xD;
      interest include biliary cancers, head and neck cancers, esophageal cancers, sarcoma, and&#xD;
      malignant mesothelioma, and at least 8 subjects will be enrolled for each of these tumor&#xD;
      types. Subjects with biliary cancers and other tumor types based on the efficacy data of the&#xD;
      first part will be enrolled in the second part of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will receive HX009 via intravenous infusion at 5 mg/Kg once every 2 weeks. Treatment&#xD;
      will continue until loss of clinical benefit at the discretion of the investigator, or&#xD;
      intolerable toxicity, or withdrawal of consent, or disease progression, or death, or loss of&#xD;
      follow-up (whichever occurs first). The maximum duration of treatment with HX009 is one year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tumor evaluation is conducted by the investigator according to the Response Evaluation&#xD;
      Criteria in Solid Tumors Version 1.1 (RECIST 1.1) and immune RECIST (iRECIST), and is&#xD;
      repeated every 6 weeks. Adverse events (AEs) are graded according to the National Cancer&#xD;
      Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE).&#xD;
