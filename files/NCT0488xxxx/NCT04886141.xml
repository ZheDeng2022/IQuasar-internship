  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Two groups of pediatric patients between the ages of 4 to 12 years old will be examined in&#xD;
      this study. The treatment group will receive dental treatment while wearing Virtual reality&#xD;
      Headset. Control group will receive the standard of care dental treatment with under nitrous&#xD;
      sedation. Procedures performed in all groups will be restorative treatments, which can&#xD;
      include intraoral anesthetic injections, placing dental fillings, crowns, and the extractions&#xD;
      of teeth. In group 1, A specific VR headset, the &quot;Oculus Quest 2&quot; will be used. Through the&#xD;
      headset, a video will be played for the child during a dental procedure.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized controlled, interventional therapy utilizing virtual reality goggles as&#xD;
      a method of distraction. Data will be collected during and after the procedure on the type of&#xD;
      behavior displayed and the child's response to standardized questions. Pediatric patients&#xD;
      aged 4-12 years who only require nitrous sedation to complete painful dental treatment which&#xD;
      necessitates anesthesia will be included in this study. These patients exhibit Frankl 2-3&#xD;
      behavior, requiring behavior guidance in order to complete the procedure. Frankl 1 or 4&#xD;
      children, those who do not need behavior guidance at all, or children with heavy behavior&#xD;
      guidance who would not be able to complete the procedure, will be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be recruited in the clinic, during a new patient exam, routine hygiene or&#xD;
      operative dentistry appointment. Following the Frankl behavior score diagnosis, an evaluation&#xD;
      of behavior will happen during the beginning of the appointment, specifically watching for&#xD;
      acceptance of treatment plan, openness to conversation, and any defiant behaviors or crying.&#xD;
      If the child had previously presented as Frankl 2-3 within 6 months of the day of screening,&#xD;
      the child may be considered for the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The parent and child being recruited for the study will be informed of the nature of the&#xD;
      study, the possible risks benefit and alternatives, and written consent will be obtained from&#xD;
      the parent or legal guardian. Assent from child 7 to 12 will also be required as well. The&#xD;
      qualifying patient will enter the operatory and be admitted into the study. Participants will&#xD;
      be briefed on how the study will proceed, and will be randomized into a control group,&#xD;
      (continuing a typical procedure using nitrous oxide ), or treatment group (continuing a&#xD;
      procedure with the VR goggles). The groups will be selected at random prior to treatment in&#xD;
      the study, using the flip of a coin. Both Groups will use of FLACC, Wong-Baker FACES, and&#xD;
      Houpt Behavior scales to access the pain or discomfort of subjects. The treatment group will&#xD;
      have the goggles placed on the head and in front of the eyes. The goggles are automatically&#xD;
      set to start media as soon as the wearer dons them. The patient will be reclined, and placed&#xD;
      in an ideal setting, and the goggles will be calibrated to the patient's current view. The&#xD;
      dental procedure will then follow. Most procedures require a local anesthetic injection, and&#xD;
      if the patient receives this injection, participants will be graded with FLACC score during&#xD;
      the injection. At the end of the procedure the child will be evaluated using the Wong-Baker&#xD;
      FACES scale, the Houpt Crying and Movement Scales, and a survey will be given to the patient&#xD;
      to be completed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will participate in the study during a restorative dental appointment, however,&#xD;
      some patients may need more the one restorative visit. Participants who require multiple&#xD;
      restorative treatments will only being include in the study during one visit and no other&#xD;
      research activities will occur after. Most appointments are projected to last a maximum of 1&#xD;
      hour. The limiting factor in all treatment in this study, will be the participant's&#xD;
      willingness to participate in future appointments.&#xD;
