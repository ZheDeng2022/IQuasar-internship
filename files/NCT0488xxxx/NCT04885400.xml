  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The current study is an open trial that will test the feasibility and acceptability of a&#xD;
      web-based adaptation of the Jobs program (further be referred to as iJobs). We will use a&#xD;
      repeated measures design: one group and three measurements (baseline, post-intervention, 3&#xD;
      months follow-up). iJobs consists of five sessions spread over a two-week period. The&#xD;
      participants will learn and exercise successful job search strategies (e.g. finding job&#xD;
      openings, creating an attractive resume, demonstrating effective interviews).&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Job search behavior effort</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline to follow-up (3 months).</time_frame>
    <description>Job search behavior effort: Job Search Behavior Scale (Blau, 1994) was designed to measure participant's involvement in job search activities, in terms of frequency and intensity. The minimum score is 16 and the maximum is 80. A higher score means a better outcome (increased job search behavior effort).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Satisfaction with the intervention</measure>
    <time_frame>Post-intervention (2 weeks).</time_frame>
    <description>Satisfaction with the intervention will be measured using 21 items. We will use 5 items aiming at the program's content retrieved from a questionnaire used for measuring the alliance between trainers and trainees in a face-to-face JOBS intervention. The minimum score is 6 and the highest is 42. A higher score means a better outcome (increased satisfaction with the intervention). Also, we will use 16 items retrieved from a scale previously used for measuring the satisfaction with an online intervention delivered on the same platform as we will use for our program. Nine of the items are measured on a Likert scale. The minimum score is 7 and the maximum is 42. A higher score means greater satisfaction. 7 items are open-ended questions and imply qualitative analysis.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>System usability</measure>
    <time_frame>Post-intervention (2 weeks).</time_frame>
    <description>We will use a 10 item questionnaire (Bangor et al., 2009) designed to measure participants' satisfaction with e-cbt, the online platform used for the program delivery. The minimum score of System Usability Scale is 10 and the highest one is 50. A higher score means a better outcome.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Job-Search Self-Efficacy</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline to post-intervention (2 weeks).</time_frame>
    <description>Job Search Self-Efficacy Scale was designed to measure participant's perception of their ability to gain employment. We will use the 20 item version of the scale developed by Saks et al., 2015. The minimum score is 20 and the maximum is 100. A higher score means a better outcome (increased job search self-efficacy).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Self-esteem</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline to post-intervention (2 weeks).</time_frame>
    <description>Rosenberg's Self Esteem Scale is a self-esteem measure widely used in social science research. It is a ten-item Likert-type scale with items answered on a four-point scale-from strongly disagree to strongly agree. The scale measures global self-worth by measuring both positive and negative feelings about the self. The minimum score of Rosenberg's Self Esteem Scale is 10 and the highest one is 40. A higher score means a better outcome.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Inoculation against setbacks</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline to post-intervention (2 weeks).</time_frame>
    <description>We will use 3 items retrieved from previous studies (Vuori &amp; Vinokur, 2005) aiming to measure the effectiveness of JOBS intervention in terms of participant's ability to deal with setbacks. The minimum score is 3 and the maximum is 15. A higher score means a better outcome (presence of inoculation against setbacks).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Future Career Anxiety</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline to post-intervention (2 weeks).</time_frame>
    <description>We will measure participant's anxiety regarding their future career in the context of the COVID-19 outbreak with the Future Career Anxiety Scale developed by Tsai et al., 2017 (Mahmud et al., 2020). The minimum score is 5 and the maximum is 25. A higher score means a worse outcome (increased anxiety).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ9)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline to post-intervention (2 weeks).</time_frame>
    <description>Patient Health Questionnaire-9 was designed to measure participant's severity of depression using DSM IV criteria. The minimum score of Patient Health Questionnaire-9 is 0 and the highest one is 27. A higher score means a worse outcome (more severe symptoms of depression).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Generalised Anxiety Disorder Assessment (GAD7)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline to post-intervention (2 weeks).</time_frame>
    <description>Generalised Anxiety Disorder Assessment is a self-administered 7 item instrument that uses some of the DSM-V criteria for GAD (General Anxiety Disorder) to identify probable cases of GAD along with measuring anxiety symptom severity. The minimum score of Generalised Anxiety Disorder Assessment is 0 and the highest one is 21. A higher score means a worse outcome (a higher level of anxiety).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Employment status</measure>
    <time_frame>Follow-up (3 months).</time_frame>
    <description>Self-reported employment status (phone screening).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Job Quality</measure>
    <time_frame>Follow-up (3 months).</time_frame>
    <description>For those who found employment - phone screening.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Treatment adherence</measure>
    <time_frame>Post-intervention only (2 weeks).</time_frame>
    <description>The number of completed assignments; Quality of completed assignment (qualitative rating of the degree of completeness and depth of the answer for each assignment, conducted by two independent experts based on apriori established coding greeds).</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Physical health</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline only (factors to be controlled for).</time_frame>
    <description>We will use a short-version of the Physical Health Complaints Scale (Ware, 1999) to measure participant's perception of their health. The minimum score is 4 and the highest is 20. A higher score means a better outcome (better physical health).</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Financial strain</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline only (factors to be controlled for).</time_frame>
    <description>We will use a single item from Vuori &amp; Vinokur, 2005 to assess participants' financial strain, respectively: 'What is the financial situation of your family/household in your opinion?'. The minimum score is 1 while the maximum is 5. A higher score means a high level of financial strain.</description>
