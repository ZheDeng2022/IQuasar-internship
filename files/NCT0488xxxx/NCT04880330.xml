      Smoking is a major risk factor for morbidity and mortality. The French High Authority for&#xD;
      Health recommends that &quot;All health professionals must advise every smoker to stop smoking,&#xD;
      regardless of the form of tobacco used, and offer advice and assistance to quit&quot;. The&#xD;
      modalities of accompaniment towards quitting and support during the withdrawal period vary&#xD;
      according to each smoker, his or her degree of motivation, the intensity of his or her&#xD;
      dependence, and any previous attempts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nicotine substitutes are the first-line drug treatment, and can be part of a strategy to stop&#xD;
      using nicotine right away or to reduce consumption with a view to quitting later. According&#xD;
      to the opinion of the High Council of Public Health of 22 February 2016, ZYBAN and CHAMPIX&#xD;
      can be prescribed as second-line medications for smoking cessation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The electronic cigarette is not recommended to date as a smoking cessation aid, but can be a&#xD;
      smoking cessation aid.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypnosis, cognitive and behavioral therapies, acupuncture are also used for withdrawal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Auriculotherapy (ART) is based on the observation that treating specific points on the pinna&#xD;
      improves some symptoms, relieves pain and anxiety. It is practiced in the context of Pain&#xD;
      Assessment and Treatment Centers (PATC) where it is particularly effective on certain&#xD;
      stubborn pains, in supportive care and in cancerology. It is also effective in general&#xD;
      medicine where it provides an interesting non-drug therapeutic aid. It is also used in&#xD;
      smoking cessation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Auriculotherapy is taught in France within the framework of an inter-university diploma&#xD;
      (Strasbourg- Paris XI). The doctors involved in this study have all been trained in this way&#xD;
      and regularly use ART by integrating it into their practice within the Foch's PATC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cryo-auriculotherapy treatment (injection of nitrous oxide at -89°C) is a simple and powerful&#xD;
      treatment since the effect of one session seems to last, depending on the indications, for&#xD;
      about 1 to 4 weeks, thus reducing the number of sessions required.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We hypothesized that ART treatment by cryotherapy of specific points of the auricle could&#xD;
      help smoking cessation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This first proof-of-concept project, named StopAuric, is realized to validate our hypothesis&#xD;
      on a population of motivated patients who will not use nicotine substitutes in order to&#xD;
      measure the impact of cryo-ART alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is a prospective, multicenter, controlled, single-blind, randomized study in 2 parallel&#xD;
      groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be randomized into 2 groups :&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Experimental group &quot;True Cryo-auriculotherapy&quot;: Patients will be treated with&#xD;
           auriculotherapy with N2O (nitrogen) projection on specific smoking cessation points.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  &quot;Sham&quot; control group: the patients will be treated according to the same scheme as the&#xD;
           experimental group with a technique without N2O (sham cryotherapy), but with the&#xD;
           presence of the propellant gaz.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Responses to the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), Patient Global Impression of&#xD;
      Change questionnaire (PGIC) self-questionnaires, satisfaction VAS, possible weight gain,&#xD;
      smoking consumption, and measurement of exhaled Carbon mOnoxide (CO) and urinary cotinine&#xD;
      will be collected at one month.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be able to say whether or not they wish to continue the same treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If this proof-of-concept study is positive regarding the interest of an ART session in&#xD;
      smoking cessation, we planned to initiate a larger study (named Auriculo-TABAC) evaluating&#xD;
      the value of a complete ART treatment program in smoking cessation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This largest study will treat patients of the experimental arm with CryoAuriculotherapy over&#xD;
      3 sessions (D0, D30 and D60).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The expected effect of smoking cessation will be evaluated at 3 and 6 months.&#xD;

There are seven questions related to anxiety (total A) and seven others related to the depressive dimension (total D), allowing thus obtaining two scores (maximum score of each score = 21).&#xD;
Higher score indicates a certain symptomatology :&#xD;
7 or less: absence of symptoms 8 to 10: doubtful symptomatology 11 and more: certain symptomatology.</description>
