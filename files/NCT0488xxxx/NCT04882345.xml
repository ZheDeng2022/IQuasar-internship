    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Over 18 years old (including 18 years old) and under 75 years old (including 75 years&#xD;
             old)&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Histologically or cytologically diagnosed as locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. The CTCAE ≥ grade 3 AE related to osimertinib treatment in previous treatment with&#xD;
             osimertinib, or platelet count &lt;75×109 / L (≥CTCAE grade 2), white blood cell count&#xD;
             &lt;3×109 / L (≥ CTCAE grade 2), total bilirubin&gt; 1.5×ULN (≥CTCAE grade 2), transaminase&#xD;
             (ALT/AST)&gt;3.0×ULN (≥CTCAE grade 2), and the toxic reaction has been alleviated or&#xD;
             restored to ≤CTCAE grade 1 patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Tumor tissue samples diagnosed as locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC are confirmed&#xD;
             to be EGFR sensitive mutations (including exon 19 deletion or L858R, both alone or&#xD;
             coexist with other EGFR mutations). If the tumor tissue is accessible, it is&#xD;
             recommended to send the tumor tissue for examination; if the tumor tissue is not&#xD;
             accessible or the patient cannot accept a tissue biopsy, a blood sample is also&#xD;
             acceptable.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. The Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) physical status score is 0 to 1, and it&#xD;

             and the longest diameter at baseline is ≥10 mm (if it is a lymph node, the short&#xD;
             diameter is required to be ≥15 mm). The selected measurement method is suitable for&#xD;
             accurate repeat measurement, which can be computed tomography (CT) or magnetic&#xD;
             resonance scan (MRI). If there is only one measurable lesion, it can be accepted as&#xD;
             the target lesion, and a baseline assessment of the tumor lesion should be performed&#xD;
             at least 14 days after the diagnostic biopsy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Women of childbearing age should take appropriate contraceptive measures from&#xD;
             screening to 3 months after stopping the study treatment and should not breastfeed.&#xD;

                  greater than 50 years and all exogenous hormone replacement therapy is stopped.&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. For women younger than 50 years old, if the amenorrhea is 12 months or more after&#xD;

&#xD;
               3. Have received irreversible sterilization, including hysterectomy, bilateral&#xD;
                  ovariectomy or bilateral fallopian tube resection, except for bilateral fallopian&#xD;
                  tube ligation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Male patients should use barrier contraception (i.e. condoms) from screening to 3&#xD;
             months after stopping the study treatment.&#xD;
