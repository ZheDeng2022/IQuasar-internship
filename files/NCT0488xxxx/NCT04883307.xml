  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of the Professional Development Coaching Program is to allow trainees to understand&#xD;
      their development over time, find meaning and purpose in their work, and identify their&#xD;
      strengths and how to use these to overcome challenges and stressors. Additionally, the&#xD;
      program connects trainees with a faculty member who will work with them, grow to know them&#xD;
      in-depth over time, and provide meaningful guidance throughout the relationship. There is an&#xD;
      additional benefit to the coaches themselves, who are able to connect with other faculty&#xD;
      coaches in a rewarding way, that provides faculty development in leadership development and&#xD;
      positive psychology, and space to interact with a group of like-minded physicians.&#xD;

      A randomized controlled trial was performed to evaluate the effects of coaching on wellness,&#xD;
      fulfillment and burnout through AWS from 2018-2020. The research protocol and all research&#xD;
      materials and methods were reviewed and approved by the Mass General Brigham Institutional&#xD;
      Review Board (Protocol #: 2017P00056) and funded through a grant provided by the Physicians&#xD;
      Foundation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AWS is a global, professional surgical society whose mission is to &quot;to inspire, encourage,&#xD;
      and enable women surgeons to realize their professional and personal goals.&quot;9 Concordant with&#xD;
      its mission, the organization launched a formal coaching program in which practicing surgeons&#xD;
      would volunteer to be trained in positive psychology coaching and paired with women surgical&#xD;
      trainees for a remote coaching relationship.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants, randomization and outcome measures Members of AWS were recruited to participate&#xD;
      in the study as coaches (attendings) or coachees (residents) via direct emails and social&#xD;
      media. Attending surgeons were required to be women members of AWS, be in active surgical or&#xD;
      surgical subspecialty practice and were required to reside in the United States (US) or&#xD;
      Canada to be eligible to be a coach. Coachees were also women members of AWS, residents of&#xD;
      the US and Canada, and were actively in residency training for the duration of the program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants (coaches and coachees) were required to complete a baseline questionnaire&#xD;
      including an informed consent item, demographic characteristics, Professional Fulfillment&#xD;
      Index (PFI), Positive Emotion, Engagement, Relationship, Meaning, and Accomplishment scale&#xD;
      (PERMA), Intolerance of Uncertainty scale (IUS), and Hardiness Resilience Score (HRS).10-13&#xD;
      Region was determined using self-reported cities and states as laid out in the US Census&#xD;
      Divisions.14 Field of specialty or prospective specialty was also noted. The participating&#xD;
      surgical residents were then randomized to the intervention group or the control group based&#xD;
      on PFI's burnout sub-scale's quartile scores at pre-survey. After the 9-month study period,&#xD;
      all participants received a follow up questionnaire similar to the baseline questionnaire.&#xD;
      Those who completed the follow up questionnaire received a digital $10 gift card to an online&#xD;
      shopping vendor as remuneration for study completion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention - The AWS Coaching Project Coaches who participated in the study completed a&#xD;
      3-hour in-person coaching training program at the 2018 and 2019 Association of Women Surgeons&#xD;
      national meetings. Coaching materials were created by an author who is an expert in&#xD;
      professional development coaching (K.P). in conjunction with the McLean Hospital Institute of&#xD;
      Coaching. Training was interactive and led by Dr. Palamara and emphasized the basics&#xD;
      principles of positive psychology and coaching. The coaches were supplied with a training&#xD;
      manual with step by step guides for three coaching sessions with their coachees developed for&#xD;
      this program (link to website). Each meeting was expected to be 45-60 minutes in length. In&#xD;
      addition, coaches were also invited to participate in up to two additional optional 90-minute&#xD;
      refresher training sessions which were offered virtually over a web-based video platform.&#xD;
      Unique aspects of the curriculum tailored to the study population included discussion of&#xD;
      imposter syndrome, the glass ceiling in surgery, and microaggressions. Additional details&#xD;
      regarding the coaching training and program are published separately. 6,7 Upon completion of&#xD;
      training, coaches were paired with 1-2 residents who were randomized to the coaching&#xD;
      intervention group. Coach-coachee pairings were constructed based on divergent surgical&#xD;
      specialty and geographic location to create a safe space and minimize the possibility of a&#xD;
      more traditional mentoring relationship. All coaching sessions occurred remotely over voice&#xD;
      or video calls. Participants were encouraged to meet for at least 3 coaching sessions over&#xD;
      the 9-month intervention period but could meet more frequently if amenable to both parties.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Residents in the control group received three emails across the 9 month study period that&#xD;
      contained materials related to physician well-being such as personal development and&#xD;
      resilience, mindfulness, and work life-integration. Materials included recommended readings,&#xD;
      videos, and exercises and were curated by members of the Association of Women Surgeons who&#xD;
      were not involved in the coaching program.&#xD;
