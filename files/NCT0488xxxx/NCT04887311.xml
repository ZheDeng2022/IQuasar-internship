  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Ataxia Telangiectasia (A-T) is an autosomal recessively inherited neurodegenerative disorder&#xD;
      that also has dramatic effects on the immune and endocrine systems. The disorder results from&#xD;
      mutations in the A-T mutated gene (ATM) leading to a loss in the production of the ATM&#xD;
      protein.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The active compound in MBM-01 (4-hydroxy-2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine-1-oxyl) may substitute&#xD;
      for the loss of ATM by protecting cells from DNA damage, preventing and reducing oxidative&#xD;
      damage, triggering an increase in cellular survival proteins, and preserving the brain and&#xD;
      peripheral immune system.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cells lacking ATM are left defenseless and unable to repair cellular damaged DNA, to exhibit&#xD;
      normal cell cycle control, to effectively respond to oxidative damage, ionizing radiation,&#xD;
      and, alkylating agents, and to maintain a healthy immune response among others. A-T patients&#xD;
      have increased oxidative stress and significantly reduced total antioxidant levels. In an&#xD;
      early study directed to oxidative stress in A-T patients, a decrease in the levels of total&#xD;
      antioxidant capacity has been observed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is currently no cure for A-T, and current treatments are limited to palliative care.&#xD;
      Therapies include rehabilitative care, infection prevention and treatment, and screening for&#xD;
      pulmonary dysfunction and malignancies. Symptomatic treatments generally fall short and leave&#xD;
      A-T patients debilitated and in a progressively wasting state. Patients suffering from A-T&#xD;
      are in dire need of a treatment to alleviate the conditions of this disease. A drug product&#xD;
      that can substitute for the loss of ATM has the potential to provide these patients with this&#xD;
      critically unmet need. The active compound in MBM-01 has been shown to supplant the overall&#xD;
      role of ATM by reducing oxidative stress, reducing DNA double strand breaks, and decreasing&#xD;
      programmed cell death (in healthy cells). Accordingly, MBM-01 represents a potential&#xD;
      breakthrough therapy for patients afflicted with A-T providing a multifactorial approached as&#xD;
      evidenced by the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Doubling the lifespan of otherwise short lived ATM-deficient mice ;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Increasing NAD+, thereby decreasing the premature aging of A-T patients by reducing the&#xD;
           severity of A-T neuropathology, normalizing neuromuscular function, delaying memory&#xD;
           loss, and extending lifespan;&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Increasing the transcription factor BDNF and NRF2 to decrease neurodegeneration and&#xD;
           activate cellular defense machinery via antioxidant genes;&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Maintaining and improving immune system function to ameliorate A-T symptoms ;&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Protecting DNA from damage and repairing the type of DNA damage observed in A-T&#xD;
           patients;&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Preventing and reducing the type of oxidative stress observed in A-T patients;&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Increasing the lifespan of mice under various conditions and toxicities; and&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. Decreasing tumorigenesis and carcinogenesis in general.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is a multi-center open label study to assess the efficacy of MBM-01 to treat ataxia&#xD;
      telangiectasia. Patients will be assessed during three study phases: a baseline period, a&#xD;
      9-month treatment period, and a 3-month follow-up period. Patients will visit sites day 0,&#xD;
      month 3, month 6, and month 9 for safety labs and efficacy assessments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dosing will follow a weight-tiered dosing schedule administered orally QD via premarked&#xD;
      medicine cups. Patients will be administered study drug daily, 7-days a week. The patients&#xD;
      will be placed into one of four dosing groups.&#xD;
