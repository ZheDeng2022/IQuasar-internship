    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to learn whether the early initiation of a specialized and focused&#xD;
      type of radiation called stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) will impact the&#xD;
      progression of advanced adenoid cystic carcinoma, quality of life, and overall survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The name(s) of the study intervention involved in this study is:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy (SBRT)&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized phase II, open-label and non-blinded two-arm study aimed to investigate&#xD;
      the potential benefit of treating oligometastatic adenoid cystic carcinoma (ACC) with early&#xD;
      initiation of stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This research study is investigating how the specialized and focused stereotactic body&#xD;
      radiation therapy (SBRT) impacts disease progression, quality of life, and overall survival&#xD;
      in patients with a limited number of metastases (one to three) from their adenoid cystic&#xD;
      carcinoma cancer. The use of SBRT to treat all areas of disease after early spread of ACC is&#xD;
      investigational. SBRT is a more focused form of radiation compared to the palliative&#xD;
      radiation typically received per standard of care treatment. Recent retrospective studies&#xD;
      conducted suggest that patients with adenoid cystic carcinoma cancer may benefit from early&#xD;
      initiation of a targeted radiation therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research study procedures include screening for eligibility and study treatment including&#xD;
      evaluations and follow up visits. After enrollment participants wil be randomized into two&#xD;
      groups: Standard of Care or Stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT). All participants in the&#xD;
      study, regardless of treatment regimen, will be followed for up to 10 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is expected that about 66 people will take part in this research study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two organizations, Gateway for Cancer Research and the Adenoid Cystic Carcinoma Research&#xD;
      Foundation (ACCRF), are supporting this research study by providing funding.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  One to three detectable sites of metastatic disease at any organ or site (including&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  All (up to 3) metastatic foci should be amenable to SBRT as per review by a radiation&#xD;
             oncologist based on protocol specified dose / dose constraints (there is no&#xD;
             prespecified minimum or maximum size)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Controlled primary tumor&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Defined as no evidence of progression at primary or local site of disease (if known)&#xD;
             within 6 months prior to enrollment&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age 18 years or older&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  ECOG performance status of 0-2 (see Appendix A)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prior systemic therapy is allowed but no therapy (cytotoxic or molecularly targeted&#xD;
             agents) 4 weeks prior to the first fraction of radiotherapy, and until after the last&#xD;
             fraction of SBRT.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  For patients with metastases that have been previously treated (prior resection,&#xD;
             radiotherapy, radiofrequency or cryoablation):&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  If the previously treated site is controlled based on imaging, the patient is&#xD;
                  eligible for this trial and does not need further treatment of the controlled&#xD;
                  site&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  If the previously treated site is not controlled based on imaging, the patient is&#xD;
                  eligible for this trial as long as the site was treated by surgery only (not RFA&#xD;
                  or RT) and if the site is amenable to SBRT&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Women of childbearing potential must have a negative serum or urine pregnancy test&#xD;
             (minimum sensitivity 25 IU/L or equivalent units of HCG) within 72 hours prior to the&#xD;
             start of (chemo)radiation therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        &quot;Women of childbearing potential (WOCBP)&quot; is defined as any female who has experienced&#xD;
        menarche and who has not undergone surgical sterilization (hysterectomy or bilateral&#xD;
        oophorectomy) or who is not postmenopausal. Menopause is defined clinically as 12 months of&#xD;
        amenorrhea in a woman over 45 in the absence of other biological or physiological causes.&#xD;
        In addition, women under the age of 55 must have a documented serum follicle stimulating&#xD;
        hormone (FSH) level less than 40 mIU/mL.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Men who are sexually active with WOCBP must agree to use any contraceptive method with&#xD;
             a failure rate of less than 1% per year. Men who are sexually active with WOCBP will&#xD;
             be instructed to adhere to contraception for a period of 1 month after treatment.&#xD;
             Women who are not of childbearing potential (i.e., who are postmenopausal or&#xD;
             surgically sterile as well as azoospermic men) do not require contraception. See&#xD;

             enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Bone metastasis in a femoral bone for which surgical stabilization is recommended.&#xD;

             congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric&#xD;
             illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has a known additional malignancy that is progressing or requires active treatment.&#xD;
             Exceptions: include basal cell carcinoma of the skin or squamous cell carcinoma of the&#xD;
             skin that has undergone potentially curative therapy or in situ cervical cancer, and&#xD;
             low-risk prostate adenocarcinoma being managed with active surveillance. A history of&#xD;
             another separate malignancy in remission without evidence of active disease in the&#xD;
             last 2 years is permitted.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Inability to treat all sites of active disease.&#xD;
