  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Knee osteoarthritis (KOA) is one of the most common health problems around the world.&#xD;
      According to this, several interventions have been used to treat this group of patients&#xD;
      including pharmacological and non-pharmacological management such as weight reduction,&#xD;
      behavior modification, and physical therapy. Recently, high-intensity laser therapy (HILT)&#xD;
      has been used to treat patients with KOA. The results of previous studies showed that HILT&#xD;
      could help to reduce pain as well as improved function in patients with mild to moderate KOA.&#xD;
      However, there were still no standardized guidelines for HILT treatment in KOA. Also, no&#xD;
      previous studies evaluated the efficacy of HILT in patients with severe KOA. The present&#xD;
      study, therefore, recruited not only mild to a moderate degree but also severe degree. The&#xD;
      study aim was to determine the efficacy of HILT in terms of pain relief in patients with&#xD;
      mild, moderate, and severe KOA. The hypothesis was HILT would effectively reduce pain in&#xD;
      patients with KOA compared to sham laser plus conservative treatment.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      -  This study is a double-blinded randomized control trial that compared the efficacy of&#xD;
           HPLT to sham laser in patients with KOA.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  42 patients who had KOA diagnosed by the American college of rheumatology (ACR) 2016&#xD;
           guidelines were recruited including a drop out of 20%.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The participants were then randomly allocated into two groups (21 participants per&#xD;
           group), mainly HILT and sham laser. Also, both groups received conservative treatment&#xD;
           such as disease education, exercise, and advice for weight reduction.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The intervention group received HILT which was applied on the medial, lateral, and&#xD;
           posterior part of the knee joint. The total energy was 562.5 J per session which was&#xD;
           done 2-3 sessions a week, for a total of 10 sessions.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The control group received sham laser by the same device for 10 sessions plus&#xD;
           conservative treatment as in the intervention group.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The outcome measures, VAS and T-WOMAC score were recorded before and at the end of the&#xD;
           study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS 18.0 version to evaluate the statistically&#xD;
           significant change within the same group and the difference between groups.&#xD;

    <measure>Visual Analogue Scale (VAS)</measure>
    <time_frame>VAS was recorded in the two time points. The first time point was at the baseline or before starting the treatment. After that, VAS was recorded post-intervention (at 4 weeks from baseline) as the second time point.</time_frame>
    <description>VAS is the standardized pain measurement which allows subjects to rate pain score by using the ruler scale. This pain scale starts from 0 which means no pain to 10 which means maximum pain.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Thai version of the Western Ontario and McMaster (WOMAC) Osteoarthritis Index for knee osteoarthritis (T-WOMAC)</measure>
    <time_frame>T-WOMAC was recorded in the two time points. First, T-WOMAC was recorded at the baseline and was then recorded post-intervention (at 4 weeks from baseline) as the second time point.</time_frame>
    <description>WOMAC score is the questionnaire used to assess pain and function in patients with knee OA. This score consists of 3 subscale including pain, function and joint stiffness. The total scores of all subscales are 96 points in which the higher score reflects the more disabled of the patient. For Thai version of WOMAC, this score has been proven valid for using in patients with knee OA.</description>

    <description>HILT was done by Multiwave Locked System (MLS) laser therapy combining 2 laser wavelengths (808 and 905 nm) in order to strengthen the effects of HILT. The laser was applied on medial, lateral and posterior parts around the knee joint. The total energy per session was 562.5 Joules (J) which was done 2-3 times a week for a total of 10 sessions.&#xD;
Additionally, the participants received conservative treatment for knee OA such as education about the disease, proper activities, and exercise.</description>
