      Phase 3 efficacy and safety of acoramidis in subjects with symptomatic Transthyretin Amyloid&#xD;
      Polyneuropathy (ATTR-PN)&#xD;

      Transthyretin amyloid polyneuropathy (ATTR-PN), also called &quot;Familial Transthyretin-Mediated&#xD;
      Amyloid Polyneuropathy (FAP)&quot; is a hereditary condition caused by mutations in the TTR gene.&#xD;
      It is estimated that around 10,000 people in the world are affected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In ATTR-PN, amyloid builds up in the nerves that detect temperature, pain, and touch.&#xD;
      Patients with ATTR-PN can experience a loss of sensation, tingling, numbness, or pain in the&#xD;
      hands and feet (also called peripheral neuropathy).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study Eidos, a BridgeBio Company, is researching the investigational drug acoramidis&#xD;
      (AG10) hydrochloride (HCl) 800mg administered orally twice a day. Through the study,&#xD;
      Eidos/BridgeBio wants to evaluate the efficacy and safety of acoramidis in patients with&#xD;
      ATTR-PN.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome of the study is to determine the efficacy of acoramidis in the treatment&#xD;
      of subjects with symptomatic transthyretin amyloid polyneuropathy (ATTR-PN).&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of 18 months, participants will be eligible to continue to receive acoramidis to&#xD;
      evaluate the long-term safety and tolerability of acoramidis.&#xD;
