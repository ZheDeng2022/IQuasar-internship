      Feasibility and pilot study using within-group design with the aim of examining whether the&#xD;
      blended psychological treatment for PTSD is acceptable for patients and therapists. 20&#xD;
      patients will be included and 4 therapists. Semi-structured interviews will be conducted&#xD;
      after treatment with a selection of therapists and patients with questions regarding the&#xD;
      helpfulness and feasibility of the treatment. Effects of the treatment will be assessed via&#xD;
      standardized self-report outcome measures regarding PTSD, depression, anxiety, sleep, quality&#xD;
      of life, function and patient satisfaction / acceptance. Measurements are conducted before,&#xD;
      during, immediately after and 6 months after treatment. The study is conducted at 2&#xD;
      psychiatric outpatient clinics in the Stockholm Region.&#xD;

      Research question and hypothesis&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research question is: Is blended psychological treatment for PTSD via a digital support&#xD;
      acceptable and applicable to patients and clinicians? The hypothesis is that testing the&#xD;
      digital support and blended delivery format in a smaller scale pilot study will bring to&#xD;
      light how the support and treatment could be augmented to better adhere to patients and&#xD;
      clinicians needs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedure&#xD;
&#xD;
      The feasibility study will be carried out in collaboration with 2 psychiatric care units in&#xD;
      the Stockholm region. In these clinics a handful of therapists will implement the treatment&#xD;
      with altogether 20 PTSD patients and assess the digital support and treatment modules. A task&#xD;
      group of 3 psychologists will develop the treatment platform and the inherent modules and&#xD;
      work materials. The therapists will work closely with the task group and regularly provide&#xD;
      feedback of their experiences of working with the platform. Learning obtained from the study&#xD;
      will be utilized to improve and adjust the digital support and treatment procedure in&#xD;
      preparation for a larger randomized study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To enable implementation of the digital support in health care services it will be integrated&#xD;
      into the digital health care platform Support and Treatment (SOB). SOB is a well-established&#xD;
      national health system available to clinicians via the patient medical journals. The support&#xD;
      will be internet-based and consist of self-help modules that incorporates similar treatment&#xD;
      components as those found in evidence-based trauma-focused cognitive behavioural therapy&#xD;
      (TF-CBT) protocols. The treatment modules will consist of educational texts, filmed&#xD;
      illustrations, case examples, and relevant worksheets. The purpose of the support is to&#xD;
      function as a treatment foundation, both for face-to-face appointments and as guided&#xD;
      self-help.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology/approach/data analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
      To be included in the study participants must meet diagnostic criteria for PTSD as their&#xD;
      primary problem according to Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5),&#xD;
      have basic reading and writing skills in Swedish, and not express acute suicidal ideation.&#xD;
      Patients with concurrent comorbid psychiatric problems are eligible for inclusion unless&#xD;
      another psychiatric diagnosis is assessed as primary to PTSD. Patients will be recruited from&#xD;
      the regular flow of patients who seek treatment for psychological problems in the selected&#xD;
      clinics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research question will be investigated using both qualitative and quantitative research&#xD;
      methods. Qualitative data will be collected via semi-structured interviews with therapists&#xD;
      and a selection of patients with the aim of exploring participant's experience of working&#xD;
      with the program and strengths and weaknesses of the blended treatment package. Interviews&#xD;
      will be carried out by members of the research group post-treatment. The interviews will be&#xD;
      transcribed and thematically analyzed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To further assess patient acceptability two questionnaires will be distributed following&#xD;
      treatment. The Client Satisfaction Questionnaire-8 (CSQ-8) has demonstrated good psychometric&#xD;
      properties including high reliability and construct validity. The Credibility/Expectancy&#xD;
      Questionnaire (CEQ) is the most widely used measure of treatment credibility and expectancy&#xD;
      in psychotherapy research. The CEQ consists of five items that are scored on a 10-point&#xD;
      likert scale and has demonstrated high internal consistency (Cronbach's α = .84) and high&#xD;
      test-retest reliability (r = .75 - .83). Treatment effects in terms of PTSD-symptoms, other&#xD;
      psychiatric symptoms, general functioning and quality of life, will be measured by&#xD;
      standardized self-rated measures with good reliability and validity. Outcome measures will be&#xD;
      administered before, during and after therapy. Statistical analysis will be conducted to&#xD;
      measure change over time and effect sizes (hedges g) will be calculated. Moreover, reliable&#xD;
      change (RC) and clinically significant change (CSC) will be meassured according to the&#xD;
      criteria established by Jacobson and Truax (22).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Significance&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this project is to increase availability to evidence-based treatment for&#xD;
      individuals with PTSD that is effective, acceptable and resource-efficient. PTSD patients&#xD;
      make up 2.8% (n = 10342) of the total number of psychiatric patients in the Stockholm region&#xD;
      in 2018, according to data collected via the project &quot;dissemination of guideline based care&#xD;
      for PTSD&quot;. Of these, 15-20% of patients are estimated to have received evidence-based&#xD;
      psychological treatment. This indicates that the majority of individuals suffering from PTSD&#xD;
      are not receiving appropriate care in Stockholm. Blended treatment may be a solution to this&#xD;
      problem and that a small scale feasibility/pilot study is a valuable first step to test the&#xD;
      treatment and learn how it can be improved before launching a larger randomized trial. Hence&#xD;
      the significance of this study.&#xD;
