  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Weeks and months after they have seemingly recovered from COVID-19, many patients continue to&#xD;
      suffer from major long-term effects. While the virus typically hits the respiratory system,&#xD;
      accumulating evidence now indicates a variety of other, non-respiratory symptoms, some of&#xD;
      which manifest long after recovery from the acute phase of the disease.&#xD;
      Neurologically-related symptoms among COVID-19 convalescents include extreme fatigue,&#xD;
      headaches, sleep and mood disorders, cognitive decline and long-lasting impairments in the&#xD;
      gustatory and olfactory systems. Interestingly, it seems that there is no direct link between&#xD;
      the severity of the disease in its acute stage and the existence or the severity of the&#xD;
      long-lasting symptoms. This means that to date, the possibility that even patients who&#xD;
      present mild to moderate symptoms will still go on to develop long-lasting neuropsychiatric&#xD;
      disorders following the disease cannot be ruled out. Unfortunately, most of the scientific&#xD;
      literature relies on self-report of recovered patients and on qualitative assessments of&#xD;
      healthcare workers. The literature still lacks a quantified objective characterization of&#xD;
      these long-term impairments. Such data ought to be collected using designated questionnaires&#xD;
      and validated neuropsychological assessments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to allow for a better understanding of the biological mechanisms that underlie&#xD;
      long-term effects of COVID-19, comprehensive research in this population is required.&#xD;
      Alongside the identification of the variety of symptoms involved, the importance of an&#xD;
      interdisciplinary approach that will take into account the emotional and cognitive aspects of&#xD;
      the patients is necessary. Patients need accurate information about the possible consequences&#xD;
      of this disease, in order to reduce their anxiety and, if needed, to allow them and their&#xD;
      family members and caretakers to prepare for the comings. A systematic characterization of&#xD;
      the mental effects of COVID-19 will allow global healthcare systems to develop prevention and&#xD;
      rehabilitation programs and provide psychological and/or psychiatric follow-up and&#xD;
      intervention programs, according to circumstances. By elucidating the mechanisms underlying&#xD;
      emotional and cognitive deficits in COVID-19 convalescents, this study may improve future&#xD;
      management of the consequences of the pandemic, potentially contributing to the development&#xD;
      of efficient medical treatments for populations who suffer from the long-term effects of the&#xD;
      disease.&#xD;

      70 participants (above 18 years of age) will be recruited from the post-COVID recovery clinic&#xD;
      at the Beilinson Hospital, in the Rabin Medical Center (RMC). Only patients previously&#xD;
      diagnosed using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), and that had no&#xD;
      neurological or psychiatric disease prior to the COVID-19 episode, will be included. To avoid&#xD;
      the risk of measuring adverse effects of lack of oxygen and/or artificial respiration&#xD;
      procedures, COVID-19 patients who suffered from severe acute disease (according to World&#xD;
      Health Organization criteria) will be excluded from participation. All potential participants&#xD;
      will be given a detailed explanation about the research goals and procedure and they will all&#xD;
      be asked to sign an institutional review board (IRB) consent form. Two groups, matched for&#xD;
      age (5Â± years), will be examined: 35 case study patients: convalescents who report suffering&#xD;
      from cognitive/emotional decline after recovering from COVID-19, and 35 control cases:&#xD;
      convalescents with no cognitive/emotional complaints Participants will undergo: (1) An&#xD;
      evaluation of COVID-19-related symptoms such as fatigue, post-exertional malaise, dizziness,&#xD;
      etc. (2) A comprehensive evaluation of behavioral measures (e.g., hearing, vision, olfaction,&#xD;
      sleep, social engagement) (3) A short validated neuropsychological evaluation, of multiple&#xD;
      cognitive domains, with an emphasis on the memory domain; motivational factors will also be&#xD;
      taken into account using performance validity tests (4) A thorough well-being and emotional&#xD;
      state assessment, including the evaluation of mood disturbance and quality of life. The&#xD;
      assessment will involve both self-report and cognitive tasks, previously associated with&#xD;
      psychopathology. By recruiting a heterogeneous cohort in terms of symptom severity, the&#xD;
      investigators will be able to test possible correlations between the emotional and cognitive&#xD;
      impairments. In addition to the above-mentioned evaluations, a subgroup of participants will&#xD;
      undergo either magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)-positron emission&#xD;
      tomography (PET)-computed tomography (CT), with the aim of clarifying the neural mechanisms&#xD;
      underlying the neurologically-related symptoms.&#xD;
