  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Somatostatin receptor (SSR) imaging is a critical component of clinical care for many&#xD;
      patients being investigated for or with confirmed SSR positive tumors. In the past,&#xD;
      111In-octreotide imaging has been used for this purpose but it has been recently supplanted&#xD;
      globally by SSR positron emission tomography (PET) imaging due to better image quality and&#xD;
      higher diagnostic accuracy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will assess the safety and diagnostic effectiveness of 68Ga-HA-DOTATATE produced a&#xD;
      the Edmonton Radiopharmaceutical Centre (ERC).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A single centre non-randomized, non-blinded phase II prospective cohort study evaluating the&#xD;
      safety and efficacy of 68Ga-HA-DOTATATE PET/CT imaging in patients with known or suspected&#xD;
      somatostatin receptor positive tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 600 scans will be included over 6 years. All patient ages (pediatric and adult) will be&#xD;
      included. Individual patients may have more than one scan during the study period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety evaluation will consist of an adverse event assessment whil in the Nuclear Medicine&#xD;
      department at the University of Alberta Hospital. Efficacy evaluation will consist of a&#xD;
      comparison to CT and/or MRI accuracy based on 1 year follow-up clinical evaluation.&#xD;
