  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Some patients with subjective cognitive decline (SCD) progress to neurocognitive disorders&#xD;
      (NCD), whereas others remain stable; however, the neuropsychological determinants of this&#xD;
      progression have not been identified. The investigators objective was to examine baseline&#xD;
      neuropsychological indicators that could discriminate between people in whom the SCD&#xD;
      progressed to a mild or major NCD and people in whom the SCD remained stable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators retrospectively included patients consulting for SCD at a university&#xD;
      medical center's memory center (Amiens, France) and who had undergone three or more&#xD;
      neuropsychological assessments at least 6 months apart. The relationship between&#xD;
      domain-specific scores and the global cognitive score (GCS, as a function of final status&#xD;
      (stable SCD vs. progression toward a mild or major NCD)) was examined using a generalized&#xD;
      linear mixed model.&#xD;

    <description>subjective cognitive decline (SCD) neurocognitive disorders (NCD) neuropsychological indicators could discriminate between people in whom SCD progressed to a mild or major NCD and people in whom SCD remained stable.&#xD;
A global cognitive score was created using all 5 tests : Alice Heim 4-I tests inductive reasoning ; Short-term verbal memory was assessed with a 20-word free-recall test; Two measures of verbal fluency were used: phonemic and semantic; Vocabulary was assessed using the Mill Hill Vocabulary test.</description>
