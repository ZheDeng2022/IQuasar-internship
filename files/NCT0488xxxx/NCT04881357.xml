  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background; A new mouth rinse formulation (&quot;Lacer Oros Acción Integral&quot;, Lacer SA, Barcelona,&#xD;
      Spain) has been recently proposed, including O-Cymen-5-ol, potassium nitrate, zinc chloride,&#xD;
      dipotassium glycyrrhizate, sodium fluoride, panthenol and xylitol, within its ingredients.&#xD;
      Thus, it may be relevant to test the efficacy of this new &quot;Lacer Oros Acción Integral&quot; mouth&#xD;
      rinse formulation in a RCT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objective: The primary objective of this RCT will be to evaluate the&#xD;
      antiplaque/antigingivitis effects of the test mouth rinse.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Population: Consecutive subjects in supportive periodontal therapy (SPT) will be screened at&#xD;
      the Post-Graduate Periodontal Clinic in the University Complutense, Madrid, and enrolled in&#xD;
      the clinical trial if they are periodontitis patients, already enrolled in a SPT, for at&#xD;
      least 6 months, systemically healthy, with moderate gingival inflammation and complains of&#xD;
      dentin hypersensitivity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design: pilot, parallel, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, 12-week,&#xD;
      clinical trial&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention: The experimental group will use three times daily a provided manual toothbrush&#xD;
      with a sodium fluoride dentifrice, followed by the use of the test mouth rinse (Lacer Oros&#xD;
      Acción Integral - new formula, Barcelona, Spain). The control group will use three times&#xD;
      daily a provided manual toothbrush with a sodium fluoride dentifrice, followed by the use of&#xD;
      the control mouth rinse (Lacer Oros Acción Integral - new formula, without active&#xD;
      ingredients, Barcelona, Spain).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visits: Screening, baseline, 2 and 12 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcomes: Periodontal clinical outcomes (plaque levels, gingival condition, probing pocket&#xD;
      depth), Stainign, Microbiological outcomes (culture and qPCR). Patient reported outcomes,&#xD;
      compliance, adverse effects.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  35-64 years old.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Periodontitis patients, already enrolled in a SPT, for at least 6 months, and the last&#xD;
             SPT visit in the previous 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Systemically healthy, following the criteria of the American Society of&#xD;
             Anesthesiologists (ASA), for patients ASA type I or II (see also exclusion criteria).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Presence of at least three evaluable teeth in each quadrant.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Moderate gingival inflammation (≥40% bleeding on marginal probing, BOMP) (Van der&#xD;
             Weijden, Timmerman, Nijboer, Reijerse, &amp; Van der Velden, 1994) and Turesky plaque&#xD;
             index ≥1.5. Also 2017 World Workshop criteria and bleeding on probing (BOP) (Ainamo &amp;&#xD;
             Bay, 1975) criteria will be considered. The primary criteria will be BOP ≥30% and&#xD;
             Turesky plaque index ≥1.5&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  No orthodontic banding or removable prosthesis.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects willing to participate and comply with the requirements of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Complains of dentin hypersensitivity in, at least, one evaluable tooth. Dentin&#xD;
             hypersensitivity will be confirmed with evaporative sensitivity (Schiff et al., 1994),&#xD;
             with a minimum score of 2-3 (West et al., 2013), although a score of 1 will also be&#xD;
             considered as adequate. In order to be eligible, the selected tooth must not have a&#xD;
             current desensitizing therapy, must not have been restored in the last 3 moths, or&#xD;
             have a crown or a big restoration. Only incisors, canines and premolars will be&#xD;
             considered (Holland, Narhi, Addy, Gangarosa, &amp; Orchardson, 1997).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Untreated or uncontrolled periodontitis&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Regular use of antiseptic-containing and/or anti-hypersensitivity mouth rinses.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Antibiotic intake within the previous month.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Excessive exposure to acids (eating disorders, chronic regurgitation).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Chronic use of analgesic or anti-inflammatory drugs.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant women.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any adverse medical history (diabetes, osteoporosis, immunosuppression…) or long-term&#xD;
             medication (chemotherapy and immunosuppression treatment; pharmacological treatment&#xD;
             associated with gingival overgrowth such as the use of phenytoin, phenobarbital,&#xD;
             lamotrigine, vigabatrin, ethosuximide, topiramate, primidone, nifedipine, amlodipine,&#xD;
             verapamil, cyclosporine) influencing gingival conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Conditions which requires antibiotic prophylaxis (infectious endocarditis, cardiac&#xD;
             valve prosthesis…).&#xD;
