    <textblock>
      The study has both quantitative and qualitative components. The aim of study is to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Culturally adapt and integrate the existing Cognitive Behavioral Therapy based&#xD;
           Motivational Interviewing (MICBT) and Mindfulness based relapse prevention intervention&#xD;
           (MBRP) intervention for people with substance use disorder in Pakistan&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Test the feasibility and acceptability of the integrated intervention called CAMIAB&#xD;
           ('CAMIAB' means success in Urdu) in a randomized control trial (RCT).&#xD;

      Evidence based psychological interventions are effective treatment for Substance Use&#xD;
      Disorders but there is little evidence on effectiveness of these interventions in LMICs such&#xD;
      as Pakistan. This study aims to culturally adapt the existing CBT based Motivational&#xD;
      Interviewing (MICBT) intervention and integrate this with Mindfulness-Based Relapse&#xD;
      Prevention (MBRP) intervention for people with SUD and to test the feasibility, and&#xD;
      acceptability of the intervention in a randomized control trial (RCT) comparing four groups:&#xD;
      1) CBT based motivational interviewing group, 2) mindfulness based relapse prevention&#xD;
      intervention group, 3) the integrated CBT based motivational interviewing integrated with&#xD;
      Mindfulness based relapse prevention group (CAMIAB) and 4) treatment as usual group (TAU).&#xD;
      The treatment as usual for all treatment arms will continue. For cultural adaptation of&#xD;
      intervention, focus groups will be conducted with key stakeholders including male and female&#xD;
      substance use disorder (SUD) service users and those in recovery, family members of the&#xD;
      people with SUD, health professionals working with people with SUD, community leaders,&#xD;
      religious scholars (such as Imams) and representatives of the community&#xD;
      mosques/Temples/Church. Individual interviews will be offered to participants who prefer this&#xD;
      over a focus group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After cultural adaptation of intervention, this will be tested on a small group of&#xD;
      participants N=12, which will allow us to preliminarily test the intervention.&#xD;
      Semi-structured, one on one interviews will be undertaken with the participants in the test&#xD;
      run. This will help to obtain their opinions on the intervention, its relevance and&#xD;
      acceptability and further adaptations in the intervention will be made if needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 260 participants with SUD (n=65) in each of the four groups) will participate in a&#xD;
      feasibility randomized control trial. Participants will be recruited from primary care&#xD;
      hospitals and drug rehabilitation centers in Karachi, Lahore, Rawalpindi, Hyderabad, and&#xD;
      Peshawar Pakistan. Intervention will take place weekly over a period of 12 weeks. The&#xD;
      intervention will consist of individual as well as group sessions. Assessments will be&#xD;
      completed at baseline, after completion of intervention (12th week) and 24th week post&#xD;
      randomization. All assessments will be administered by masked research assistants (RAs), not&#xD;
      involved in delivering intervention sessions. The therapists delivering the intervention will&#xD;
      be trained and will be provided ongoing supervisions by a senior therapist.&#xD;

    <intervention_name>CBT based Motivational interviewing (MICBT)</intervention_name>
    <description>The culturally adapted MICBT will include approaches of motivational interviewing. Motivational interviewing (MI) is a well-developed and researched tool, for exploring and resolving the ambivalence to change substance use behaviour. While MI is seen as an acceptable and effective intervention to increase and consolidate motivation, to make positive changes in individuals with problematic substance use. The intervention recognises that ambivalence to change substance use behaviour is common and deals with it in the early stages of therapy using MI techniques. The intervention also recognises the need to identify and address obstacles in changing drug taking behaviour and offers ways of managing these difficulties from a cognitive behavioural formulation.</description>

    <intervention_name>Mindfulness based Relapse Prevention (MBRP)</intervention_name>
    <description>MBRP has been designed as a manualized outpatient aftercare program that incorporates cognitive-behavioural skills (i.e., effective coping skills, self-efficacy, and recognizing common antecedents of relapse) with mindfulness-based practices to decrease the probability of relapse by increasing awareness and flexible responding in the presence of substance use triggers. Exercises and practices of intervention are designed to explore the functions of habitual reactive behaviour such as substance use focusing the balance and relationship between acceptance of present moment and skilful action that makes real changes.</description>
