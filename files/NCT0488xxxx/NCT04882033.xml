      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the tolerability and toxicity of different dose of&#xD;
      anlotinib combination with concurrent chemoradiotherapy in the treatment of limited-stage&#xD;
      SCLC patients.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Anlotinib is a kinase inhibitor of receptor tyrosine with multi-targets, especially for&#xD;
      VEGFR1、VEGFR2、VEGFR3、FGFR1/2/3、PDGFRa/β c-Kit and MET. The purpose of this study is to&#xD;
      determine the maximum tolerated dose of anlotinib when combination with concurrent&#xD;
      chemoradiotherapy. From low dose group up to high dose group, each one had 3 patients at&#xD;
      least. Primary group received anlotinib 8mg. The dose of anlotinib would increase gradually&#xD;
      until MTD.&#xD;
