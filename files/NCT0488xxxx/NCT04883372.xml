      The purpose of this study is to assess glycemic control changes in insulin-treated patients&#xD;
      with diabetes using a continuous glucose monitoring CGM system through the ETAPES&#xD;
      telemedicine program.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Diabetes is currently one of the major health challenges. According to the International&#xD;
      Diabetes Federation (IDF), the number of people with diabetes has tripled in the last 20&#xD;
      years and will reach 463 million cases in 2020. This chronic disease causes degenerative&#xD;
      complications that affect the quality of life of patients and increase the morbidity and&#xD;
      mortality rate. This is due to limited access to health professionals, inadequate patient&#xD;
      education and especially poor self-management of their disease which hinders adequate&#xD;
      glycemic control of diabetes. The daily routine of a type 1 diabetic patient includes&#xD;
      self-monitoring of blood glucose levels as well as several insulin injections per day or the&#xD;
      use of an insulin pump. However, this treatment does not prevent the occurrence of micro&#xD;
      and/or macroangiopathic complications, especially when the diabetes is poorly controlled.&#xD;
      Therefore, optimal and large-scale glycemic control can have a significant clinical, social&#xD;
      and economic impact. The Diabetes Control and Complications Trial (DCCT) has shown that&#xD;
      intensive glycemic control delays or prevents the occurrence of microvascular and&#xD;
      macrovascular complications. Intensive treatment, education and support for diabetes&#xD;
      self-management improves glycated hemoglobin levels, reducing the risk of developing&#xD;
      degenerative complications. This is accompanied by a positive psychosocial and behavioral&#xD;
      effect. It is in this context that telemedicine, via remote monitoring, can improve glycemic&#xD;
      control. Diabetes remains one of the most suitable specialties for telemedicine, especially&#xD;
      with the advent of continuous glucose measurements reimbursed by health insurance since 2017.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since the 1990s, several telemonitoring projects have demonstrated the value of constant&#xD;
      support for diabetic patients, resulting in a significant improvement in HbA1c; the patient&#xD;
      becomes an actor in his or her management, with better appropriation of the disease and&#xD;
      better compliance. Remote monitoring is one of the 5 telemedicine procedures defined in&#xD;
      France. It allows a medical professional to remotely interpret the data necessary for a&#xD;
      patient's medical follow-up and to make decisions regarding the patient's care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The French health authorities have set up national experiments on remote monitoring of&#xD;
      diabetes under real conditions, such as the ETAPES program, whose objective is to evaluate&#xD;
      the clinical, medico-economic and quality of life benefits of patients who benefit from&#xD;
      remote monitoring. This program has 3 components: remote medical monitoring of patients&#xD;
      including remote interpretation of patient results and adaptation of treatment, therapeutic&#xD;
      support through face-to-face or remote sessions and the use of a remote monitoring platform&#xD;
      that provides the link between the patient and the medical team.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In December 2019, the endocrinology department of the CHSF decided to implement the ETAPES&#xD;
      program via the LIBREVIEW technical solution in order to better support unbalanced&#xD;
      insulin-treated diabetic patients.&#xD;
