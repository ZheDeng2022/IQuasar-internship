      A prospective cohort study on active surveillance after neoadjuvant chemoradiation for&#xD;
      oesophageal cancer: SANO-2 study.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      An active surveillance approach after completion of neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy for locally&#xD;
      advanced oesophageal cancer is being investigated in the SANO (Surgery As Needed for&#xD;
      Oesophageal cancer) trial, that completed patient inclusion in December 2020. First long term&#xD;
      results are expected end 2023. Based on current retrospective studies and short term results&#xD;
      of the SANO, to date there is no evidence that active surveillance is unsafe. Within the&#xD;
      follow-up of the SANO trial, the safety of active surveillance is continuously monitored.&#xD;
      Based on a high participation rate (&gt;90%) in the SANO trial and on the view of the Dutch&#xD;
      patient federation for cancer of the digestive tract (SPKS) to offer active surveillance as&#xD;
      an alternative treatment option in a controlled setting, there is a demand for a tailored&#xD;
      surgery approach after neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy until results of the SANO trial are&#xD;
      available. When patients request active surveillance outside the SANO trial, it is of the&#xD;
      utmost importance to set up a prospective cohort study (extension study) in order to monitor&#xD;
      safety, implementation and effectiveness of active surveillance outside the SANO trial before&#xD;
      the final results of the SANO trail are available.&#xD;

Scoring consisted of reversing the scores of the 2 negatively phrased items, then taking the mean of the 5 items. These means were converted to a score ranging from 0 to 100 by subtracting 1 and multiplying by 25. A score of 0 means no regret; a score of 100 means high regret.</description>

    <description>Patients will undergo two clinical response evaluations (CREs) after nCRT. During CRE-1 (5-6 weeks) patients will undergo oesophagogastroduodenoscopy (OGD) with bite-on-bite biopsies. During CRE-2 (10-12 weeks) patients will undergo positron emission tomography with computed tomography (PET-CT), endoscopy with bite-on-bite biopsies and endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS) plus fine-needle aspiration (FNA). If cancer is detected, surgery will be performed. Patients with cCR are eligible for active surveillance where regular CREs are performed to detect regrowth of cancer. Delayed oesophagectomy will be offered to patients with highly suspected or profen locoregional regrowth, without distant metastases. The safety and feasibility of active surveillance depends on several factors monitored in the SANO trial. So far, these stopping rules have not been met. In case one of the stopping rules is reached, further inclusion in the SANO-2 study will be stopped and surgical resection is offered.</description>
