  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposed study will provide critical information on Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA)&#xD;
      design characteristics that promote retention in a vulnerable and under-represented&#xD;
      population in research-youth experiencing homelessness. The study will use an EMA app to&#xD;
      collect substance use, mood, craving, social surroundings, and trauma measures over a 14-day&#xD;
      period in youth age 18-24 (n=40) recruited from Star House, a homeless youth drop-in center.&#xD;
      Youth will be randomized in 2x2 factorial design (fixed incentive model vs. prize-based&#xD;
      model; random assessment 3x vs. 6x per day).&#xD;

For each draw, individuals will use the EMA app to &quot;spin the wheel&quot; to see which prize amount they earn. Out of a total of 500 total draws, 50% will be $1, 43.6% will be $3, 6% will be medium prizes ($5), and 0.4% will be a &quot;jumbo&quot; prize ($90).</description>
