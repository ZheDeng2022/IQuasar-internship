  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Swallowing difficulty (dysphagia) is a common postoperative complication in patients who&#xD;
      undergo cardiac surgical procedures. Postoperative dysphagia in cardiac surgical patients is&#xD;
      associated with negative health-related outcomes including increased rates of pneumonia,&#xD;
      reintubation, and death as well as increased length of hospital stay and costs of care. This&#xD;
      study will examine the safety, feasibility, and impact of preoperative respiratory strength&#xD;
      training (RST) on swallowing and associated health-related outcomes in cardiac surgical&#xD;
      patients. We hypothesize that preoperative RST will be safe, well-tolerated, and lead to&#xD;
      improved swallowing and health-related outcomes in cardiac surgical patients.&#xD;

    <description>The penetration aspiration scale is a validated 8-point ordinal rating scale that measures the depth of airway invasion and the patient's response during swallowing. Scores range from 1 to 8 with a score of 1 indicating a safe swallow (best score) and 8 indicating silent aspiration (worst score).</description>
