  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Rupture of the anterior cruciate ligament is a serious and common injury. In young athletes,&#xD;
      surgical reconstruction of the anterior cruciate ligament by autograft with hamstrings or&#xD;
      patellar ligament is widely used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite relatively standardized medical, surgical, and paramedical management, the results&#xD;
      after ACL ligamentoplasty are not entirely satisfactory in term of return to sport. Recovery&#xD;
      of the quadriceps strength is recognized as one of the decision-making criteria allowing the&#xD;
      return to sport; however, significant muscle deficits are frequent at the time of return to&#xD;
      sport.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the postoperative management is well codified, focused on muscle strengthening and&#xD;
      neuromuscular retraining, some studies have addressed the value of preoperative&#xD;
      rehabilitation, and recommend a good preoperative muscular recovery of knee extensors and&#xD;
      flexors, to obtain better postoperative results at the stage of the return to sports.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These results suggest that preoperative quadriceps strength should be considered as a&#xD;
      predictor of the athletes' ability to return to sport activities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is estimated that around 10 to 30% of patients with preoperative deficits and could&#xD;
      benefit from additional rehabilitation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It can then be assumed that if the preoperative deficit is smaller, the postoperative deficit&#xD;
      will also be smaller. This is the challenge of preoperative rehabilitation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are a few studies on preoperative rehabilitation which allow a gain in strength of knee&#xD;
      extensors and flexors. However, the rehabilitation protocols applied to patients highly&#xD;
      varied and there is no consensus on one protocol. The potential improvement is in the range&#xD;
      of 10 to 20%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis of the study is that an optimal recovery of the strength of the preoperative&#xD;
      knee extensors and flexors would reduce the postoperative deficit, thus improving the return&#xD;
      to sport.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the absence of reliable information on the frequency of muscle weakness in preoperative&#xD;
      patients, we will conduct a preliminary study to obtain these data as well as the potential&#xD;
      gain in strength with our preoperative rehabilitation protocol.&#xD;
