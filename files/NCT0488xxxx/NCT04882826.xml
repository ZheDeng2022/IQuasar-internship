      This is an open-labeled (laboratory blinded), randomized, two period, single-center,&#xD;
      crossover, comparative study, where each participant will be randomly assigned to the&#xD;
      reference (Viagra®, 100 mg film-coated tablets) or the test (Sildenafil, 100 mg film-coated&#xD;
      tablets) formulation in each period of study (sequences Test-Reference (TR) or Reference-Test&#xD;
      (RT)), in order to evaluate if both formulations are bioequivalent&#xD;
