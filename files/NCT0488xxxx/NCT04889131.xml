  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall purpose of this study is to deliver a 12-week yoga program to older adults (over&#xD;
      60 years of age) in rural WI who do not have access to yoga programming and examine the&#xD;
      effects of the programming on activities of daily living, gait, balance, falls, activity&#xD;
      level and social isolation.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Participants will be assigned to immediately begin a 12-week yoga class (2 classes per week&#xD;
      for 75 minutes each) or complete a 12-week wait (wait-list control). The measures of interest&#xD;
      will be examined at pretest (wait-list only), baseline, posttest and at 3-month follow-up to&#xD;
      see what, if any, changes are maintained after completion of the program. All assessment data&#xD;
      collections sessions will be conducted on-site at a predetermined site identified by the&#xD;
      community partners.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in MiniBESTest Score</measure>
    <time_frame>[pre-test for waitlist group 3 months prior to class], baseline, post-test (3-months), 3-month follow up (6-months)</time_frame>
    <description>The mini-BESTest will be used to assess balance. This 14-item, clinical battery is used to assess balance in four component areas (anticipatory transitions, postural response, sensory orientation and dynamic gait) and provides a single number summary of balance performance. Scores range from 0 to 28, with higher scores indicating higher function.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Fall Frequency</measure>
    <time_frame>[pre-test for waitlist group 3 months prior to class], baseline, post-test (3-months), 3-month follow up (6-months)</time_frame>
    <description>Change in the frequency of falls will be assessed using a forced-choice paradigm: none, once, 2 to 10 times, weekly, or daily over the last 6 months.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in the Canadian Occupational Performance Measures (COPM)</measure>
    <time_frame>[pre-test for waitlist group 3 months prior to class], baseline, post-test (3-months), 3-month follow up (6-months)</time_frame>
    <description>The COPM is composed of the following steps: 1) participant identifies occupational performance problems for self-care and productivity, 2) participant rates each issue on a score of 1-10 (higher scores are more important), 3) participant chooses 5 most important problems, 4) participant rates each issue (1-10) for performance and satisfaction, 5) average score for each (performance and satisfaction) are calculated. Final score for each is 1-10 with higher scores better.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Activities-Specific Balance Confidence Scale (ABC)</measure>
    <time_frame>[pre-test for waitlist group 3 months prior to class], baseline, post-test (3-months), 3-month follow up (6-months)</time_frame>
    <description>The ABC Scale measures a fear of falling. It is a 16-item survey where participants rate their level of self-confidence (0-100, where 100 is the highest self-confidence) for each item. The average score is reported.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Standardized Gait Analysis: Gait Velocity</measure>
    <time_frame>[pre-test for waitlist group 3 months prior to class], baseline, post-test (3-months), 3-month follow up (6-months)</time_frame>
    <description>Using the GaitRite® System, the temporal and spatial parameters of each participant will be captured during walking. The GaitRite® mat is a 14 foot portable electronic walkway, embedded with sensors to enable the measurement spatiotemporal variables of gait such as cadence, normalized velocity, stride length, base of support, and percent of cycle in double support. Participants will begin at a starting point two meters from the mat, then walk toward and step onto the mat to continue walking until they achieve the stop line located two meters off of the opposite side of the mat. Data will be collected for forward preferred speed, backward preferred speed, forward fast, tandem and dual task gait. Each participant will complete five trials for each condition.</description>

    <measure>Change in Activity Level Measured by Number of Steps Taken</measure>
    <time_frame>[pre-test for waitlist group 3 months prior to class], baseline, post-test (3-months), 3-month follow up (6-months)</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will be fitted with a Garmin VivoSmart activity monitor and will be asked to wear the device for the duration of the study.</description>

    <measure>Change in Performance Assessment of Self-Care Skills (PASS)</measure>
    <time_frame>[pre-test for waitlist group 3 months prior to class], baseline, post-test (3-months), 3-month follow up (6-months)</time_frame>
    <description>The Performance Assessment of Self-Care Skills (PASS) assesses basic self-care and instrumental activities of daily living. Subscales: Independence, Safety, and Adequacy (0-3 where higher scores indicate less difficulty with basic self-care).</description>
