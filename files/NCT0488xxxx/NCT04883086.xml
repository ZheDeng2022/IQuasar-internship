    <textblock>
      Background: Diabetes mellitus (DM) is well known for long-term complications to general and&#xD;
      oral health. Periodontal disease has a bidirectional association with the development of type&#xD;
      2 diabetes (T2DM) (Mealey, 2006; Taylor, 2001; Demmer et el.,2008). However, current&#xD;
      literature conflicts with regards to dental caries incidence in patients with T2DM (Sampaio,&#xD;
      Mello and Alves, 2011).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: To investigate potential protective and risk factors for dental caries among T2DM&#xD;
      with vitamin D and HbA1c using clinical, salivary and microbial analyses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: This project is a case-control clinical study. The study will be conducted at Royal&#xD;
      London Dental Hospital, Institute of Dentistry, Bart's Health NHS Trust, London, UK. This&#xD;
      study will aim to recruit 182 participants in total with diabetes (type 2), aged ≥18 male or&#xD;
      female and participants will be cross-matched with non-diabetes according to age and gender.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each participant will undergo a baseline screening for around 60 minutes where all the&#xD;
      following assessments will be carried out; Caries risk assessment (CAMBRA), Plaque index,&#xD;
      International Caries Detection and Assessment System (ICDAS) and Laser fluorescence evaluator&#xD;
      (SOPRLIFE®, Acteon, France) and Oral behavioural and sociodemographic background will be&#xD;
      collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior to the clinical study, there will be a laboratory based study using extracted teeth.&#xD;
      The aim of this ex-vivo study is to assess the autofluorescence variation in dental carious&#xD;
      lesions and compare this with International Caries Detection and Assessment System (ICDAS).&#xD;

      Research purpose:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research question is individuals with Diabetes Mellitus type 2 (T2DM) is more prone to&#xD;
      dental caries?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several literature reviews point the lack of solid evidence clear association of the DM and&#xD;
      dental caries (Ship, J.A., 2003; Taylor et al., 2004; Lamster, I.B., 2014; Garton et al.,&#xD;
      2012; Leite et al., 2013).Also, a controversial result available of the epidemiology of&#xD;
      dental caries among individuals with T2DM (Sampaio, Mello and Alves, 2011), besides limited&#xD;
      knowledge about the biological explanation as seen with periodontal disease (Verhulst et al.,&#xD;
      2019).Moreover, no study had a comprehensive evaluating of all potential caries risk factors.&#xD;
      Thus this study developed a preliminary conceptual model in which 48 potential risk factors&#xD;
      were identified and categorised into four domains: biological/intra-oral factors, medical&#xD;
      factors, oral health behaviour, and sociodemographic factors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All these potential factors will be evaluated and analysed through different appoaches;&#xD;
      clinical, salivary, microbial analyses and patient questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment process:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants (n=182) who meet the selection criteria and agree to participate will be&#xD;
      invited to complete written informed consent by the PI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Invitation letters will be sent by the DARE database holders to Diabetes patients who are on&#xD;
      this database. Diabetes patients from Royal London Dental Hospital including outreach centres&#xD;
      (Barkantine, Southend and Guttman), General Endocrinology and Metabolic Medicine, Diabetic&#xD;
      clinics (including Mile End hospital) will also be invited using another invitation letter.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Regarding the control group, adult patients attending Dental Institute including outreach&#xD;
      centres (Barkantine, Southend and Guttman), staff within Queen Mary University of London and&#xD;
      Barts Health Trust and volunteers who agree to participate will be recruited.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All these participants will be approached and asked by the PI/CI whether they would be&#xD;
      interested in taking part in this research. Participants who meet the inclusion criteria,&#xD;
      will receive a written Patient Information Sheet (PIS) describing the study in details&#xD;
      (Appendix 3). Subsequently, they will be asked by the Principal Investigator (AA) to complete&#xD;
      and sign written informed consent (Appendix 4), if they wish to take part in this study. This&#xD;
      phase will take around 15 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Those who consent to take part will be given an appointment to attend the dental clinic for&#xD;
      assessments at the Institute of Dentistry.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants may enter the trial if the following apply:&#xD;
&#xD;

           influence the result of the trial, or the participant's ability to participate in the&#xD;
           trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Any condition, which in the opinion of the investigator, would preclude participation by&#xD;
           the subject (such as cross-infection control risk)&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
      The potentially capable participant will be asked to confirm that they:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Read and understand the information sheet for the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Had the opportunity to consider the information, ask questions and have had these&#xD;
           answered satisfactorily.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Understand that his participation is voluntary and that he is free to withdraw at any&#xD;
           time without giving any reason, without his medical care or legal rights being affected.&#xD;

      the dental caries extent by the aid of dental examination kit and fluorescence image&#xD;
      evaluator device and they will be expected to collect a sample of supragingival plaque,&#xD;
      saliva and blood.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is observational study without any intervention so no harm expected for these&#xD;
