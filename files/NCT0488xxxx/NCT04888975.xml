    <measure>ICG Fluorescence Lymphatic Imaging</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and at Day 28</time_frame>
    <description>ICG fluorescence lymphatic imaging evaluates for changes in lymphatic drainage of the limb. ICG is a water soluble tricarbocyanine dye, has a short plasma half life of 3 to 5 minutes in humans, is excreted exclusively by the liver into the bile, and is not associated with risk for nephrotoxicity. ICG contains sodium iodide and is recommended by manufacturer to be used with caution in patients who have a history of allergy to iodides, although type-I allergic reaction (anaphylaxis) cannot really occur because iodine is a chemical element that is an essential component of the human body.</description>
