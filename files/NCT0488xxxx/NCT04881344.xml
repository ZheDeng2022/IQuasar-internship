  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hemorrhoidal disease is a frequent anorectal disorder and the main reason for a visit to a&#xD;
      coloproctologist. Hemorrhoids are present in healthy individuals. However, they can become&#xD;
      pathologic, manifesting with pain, prolapse, itching, bleeding or soiling. Initially, they&#xD;
      can be managed conservatively. When this failed to cure the symptoms, surgical therapy is&#xD;
      indicated. For grade II (hemorrhoids prolapsing during straining but reducing spontaneously)&#xD;
      or grade III (hemorrhoids prolapsing during straining but requiring manual reduction), laser&#xD;
      hemorrhoidoplasty or mucopexy are safe and efficient procedures to treat hemorrhoids.&#xD;
      However, the optimal treatment is still under debate. Recently, a randomized controlled trial&#xD;
      reported lower recurrence and faster return to work associated with laser therapy. We aimed&#xD;
      to compare both therapies, to assess the benefits of laser therapy for the treatment of&#xD;
      hemorrhoidal disease symptoms, using a validated score.&#xD;

    <description>The primary outcome will be the &quot;Symptom Score&quot; at six postoperative months. This score ranges from 0 to 15 points, based on each of the five cardinal symptoms of hemorrhoidal disease (pain, itching, bleeding, discharge and prolapse) attributed from 0 to 3 points according to the frequency of their manifestation (0 point: never, 1 point: &gt; 1x/month, &lt;1x/week, 2 points: 1-6x/week, 3 points: 1x/day).</description>

    <description>Under local anesthetic (or general anesthetic if contraindications to local anesthetic),&#xD;
A laser optic fiber connected to a diode platform (Leonardo, Biolitec AG, Jena, Germany) will be applied threw a anoscope. After making a 1-mm opening at the external border of hemorrhoid pocket, the fiber will be introduced in the hemorrhoidal tissue. Several pulses, each lasting for 1.2 s, with a 0.6-s pause between pulses, will be delivered to the tissue.&#xD;
As a day-case procedure (or short-stay if medical or social factors precluded ambulatory intervention),&#xD;
Postoperative care will consist of: normal diet, bulking laxatives, self-irrigation to the anal wound at six times per day and painkiller. Absence for work certificate will be made for 7 days for each patient and they will be told to return to work and normal daily activities as soon as they felt able.</description>

    <description>Threw an anoscope, the hemorrhoidal cushion will be sutured using a half-circle (size 26) needle with a 2-0 poliglecaprone (Monocryl®, Ethicon, USA). Then, a continuous suture will be performed on the mucosa of the anal canal, and will terminate above the dentate line. The hemorrhoidal artery will be ligated by this suture. Then, the ligation will be tied to realize the hemorrhoidopexy.&#xD;
Same anesthetic technique and postoperative care as the intervention group. As a day-case procedure (or short-stay if medical or social factors precluded ambulatory intervention).</description>
