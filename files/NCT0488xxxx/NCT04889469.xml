  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall purpose of the project is to create a scientific basis for which patients should&#xD;
      be offered breast reduction in the public sector. More specifically , the project aims to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To examine the evidence for current national guidelines for breast reduction. The&#xD;
           hypothesis is that BMI, breast volume, resection weight, and mental and physical&#xD;
           symptoms affect the outcome of breast reconstruction, both in terms of complication&#xD;
           risks, patient satisfaction and quality of life .&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To investigate which patients benefit the most from a breast reduction, in a health&#xD;
           economic perspective. The starting point is that resources are limited and the purpose&#xD;
           is to maximize the health effects for the patient at as low cost as possible. The&#xD;
           hypothesis is that the health benefits, for the individual and society, are different&#xD;
           depending on how big the breasts are and how much symptoms a patient has preoperatively.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To examine back function and objective problems in women, with both natural and&#xD;
           augmented breasts, with different body constitutions and volumes. The hypothesis is that&#xD;
           a certain breast volume give rise to different physical symptoms in different women,&#xD;
           depending on their other physical factors.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To develop preferences for benign breast conditions that are treated in plastic surgery&#xD;
           and for complications that the treatment can cause. Preferences are used to calculate&#xD;
           QALY (quality-adjusted life years). Knowledge of preferences is essential for an&#xD;
           analysis of healthcare needs.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To examine women's experiences of how their breast hypertrophy affects them and their&#xD;
           expectations of a breast reduction. The hypothesis is that the experience breast&#xD;
           hypertrophy affects patients differently, and that expectations on a breast reduction&#xD;
           can vary between different individuals.&#xD;

    <description>Breast -Q breast reduction preoperatively and postoperatively measures quality of life and patient satisfaction in 6 domains: physical well-being, psychosocial well-being, sexual well-being, satisfaction with the breasts, satisfaction with the result and satisfaction with care. Each domain is scored 0-100, where a higher score indicate a better outcome.</description>

    <description>Multidimensional body-self relation questionnaire - appearance scales ( MBSRQ -AS).It is a 34-item self-report questionnaire designed to measure appearance related components of body-image.

It is a 5-point Likert-scale ranging from 1 to 5.</description>

    <description>Appearance schemes inventory-revised ( ASI -R)is a 20-item self-report questionnaire designed to measure body-image investment. It consists of two subscales, self-evaluative salience (SES) and motivational salience (MS). It is a 5-point Likert-scale ranging from 1 (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree). Twelve items relate to SES and eight items relate to MS. The total score is the mean of the 20 items, and the score of the subscales is the mean of the items relating to each subscale. A high score indicates greater body-image investment.</description>
