  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Infants admitted to Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) may experience a negative impact due&#xD;
      to multiple painful and stressful procedures during their hospitalization. The American&#xD;
      Academy of Pediatrics recommends that healthcare facilities taking care of newborns should&#xD;
      implement pain prevention and management programs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are some non-pharmacological techniques that have been developed to reduce newborn's&#xD;
      pain perception, including swaddling, holding, non-nutritive sucking in infants with&#xD;
      Post-menstrual age (PMA) below 32 weeks, nutritional sucking with the administration of&#xD;
      breast milk or sweeteners above 32 weeks PMA and exposure to maternal voice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Even for parents, the experience of NICU hospitalization of their child is a particularly&#xD;
      stressful event, mainly characterized by feelings of exclusion due to lack of interactions&#xD;
      with their own baby due to their clinical conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hence, it is very important to intervene as soon as possible on parental stress that can&#xD;
      affect the physical and psychological quality of life of the family. This is possible through&#xD;
      the application of nursing care plans that involve the parents in daily care and support them&#xD;
      in the long process of development and acquisition of autonomy and skills.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The nurse is a healthcare provider who has the most frequent contact with newborns&#xD;
      hospitalized in NICU and has a key role in preventing, recognizing, and managing newborn's&#xD;
      pain. However, there is a considerable discrepancy between the theory and practice: many&#xD;
      nurses and doctors are aware that most of the procedures carried out in NICU cause pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, nurses also can develop high levels of physical and psychological stress,&#xD;
      particularly when they manage a newborn who feels pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate if maternal involvement in the pain management of&#xD;
      newborn admitted to NICU may reduce the level of pain perceived by infant during the heel&#xD;
      stick procedure using the Premature Infant Pain Profile (PIPP) pain scoring tool. In&#xD;
      addition, the study's secondary goal will be to investigate if maternal involvement in pain&#xD;
      management of newborn may produce positive effects on the mother in reducing stress,&#xD;
      depression and anxiety and in reducing nurses' physical and psychological stress.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is a prospective, randomized controlled trial with a 2x2 crossover design. Study&#xD;
      population include newborns admitted to NICU that require a heel stick procedure after the&#xD;
      first week of life, mothers of enrolled infants and nurses performing the heel stick&#xD;
      procedure. The sample size will be 50 newborns who meet the inclusion criteria. Newborns will&#xD;
      be randomly assigned to receive: i) a heel stick procedure with maternal involvement and&#xD;
      after a week an heel stick procedure without maternal involvement or ii) a procedure without&#xD;
      maternal involvement and after a week a procedure with maternal involvement. For both group&#xD;
      the washout period between the two procedures is 7 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before the intervention with the maternal involvement, mother will receive a training&#xD;
      regarding the heel stick procedure and pain management.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      H1. Newborns receiving the intervention with the maternal involvement during the heel stick&#xD;
      procedure have lower pain level than those who receive the intervention without the maternal&#xD;
      involvement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      H2. Mothers who are involved in their baby pain management during the heel stick procedure&#xD;
      have lower level of stress, anxiety and depression than those who are not involved during the&#xD;
      painful procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      H3. Nurses have a positive effect in term of reducing stress level if mother is involved in&#xD;
      pain management of own baby.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PIPP (Premature Infant Pain Profile) scale will be used to evaluate the pain response during&#xD;
      the heel stick procedure. The level of stress, anxiety and depression of mother and the&#xD;
      stress level of nurse will be assessed with validated questionnaires.&#xD;
