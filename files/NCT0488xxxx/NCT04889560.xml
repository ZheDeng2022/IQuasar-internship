  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The prevalence of neurodegenerative diseases is expected to increase over the next years, in&#xD;
      parallel with the aging of the world population. Therefore, it is important to identify new&#xD;
      methods to prevent, delay or stop the neurodegenerative waterfall responsible for dementia&#xD;
      conversion. To date, there is no fully proven pharmacological treatment for cognitive&#xD;
      impairment and the available pharmacological treatments have limited efficacy because consist&#xD;
      in symptomatic drugs with adverse side effects. On this point, non-pharmacological&#xD;
      intervention may represent adjunctive therapy to medications in order to prevent or delay the&#xD;
      onset of the cognitive deficits or dementia. Recently we evaluated the effectiveness of a&#xD;
      computerized cognitive training (CoRe) in patients with early cognitive impairment. The main&#xD;
      goal of the present protocol is to evaluate the efficacy of the home-based version of CoRe&#xD;
      (Home CoRe). To this end, mild dementia or early cognitive impairment, and persons with&#xD;
      Subjective Cognitive Impairment (SCI) are enrolled and randomly assigned to the experimental&#xD;
      group (Home CoRe) or control group (CoRe). All patients are evaluated before (T0) and after&#xD;
      (T1) treatment with an exhaustive neuropsychological assessment. Furthermore, follow-up&#xD;
      visits are scheduled 6 months (T2) and 12 months (T3) after the end of the treatment.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Non-pharmacological intervention may represent adjunctive therapy to medications in order to&#xD;
      delay the onset of the cognitive deficits or dementia. Moreover, increasing evidence suggests&#xD;
      that environmental and lifestyle factors (education, cognitive engagement, experience..)&#xD;
      impact on cognitive functions and brain plasticity during the lifetime and also during aging.&#xD;
      These modifiable factors moderate differences in cognitive aging and are protective for the&#xD;
      development of dementia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Among non-pharmacological approaches, previous studies observed a positive effect of&#xD;
      Cognitive Training (CT) both in healthy elderly people and patients in the early stage of&#xD;
      neurodegenerative diseases. Moreover, the advances in the development of Information &amp;&#xD;
      Communication Technologies (ICT) has prompted the possibility to develop computer-based&#xD;
      solution for the training of cognitive functions, being able to overcome traditional-training&#xD;
      advantages. However, some issue remain unresolved and larger randomized controlled trials are&#xD;
      necessary to examine long-term CT effects, due to the lack of longitudinal studies. Our&#xD;
      previous data demonstrated that CT program with CoRe software is safe and effective on&#xD;
      cognition in patient with Parkinson Disease-Mild Cognitive Impairment, in the attempt of&#xD;
      briefly stabilizing cognitive decline, delaying the downward trajectory. The same pattern of&#xD;
      findings resulted when using CoRe in patients with Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) and mild&#xD;
      Alzheimer's Disease (AD). Among ICT advantages there is the fact that they offer the&#xD;
      possibility to develop patient tailored interventions that can be easily delivered not only&#xD;
      in-person but also remotely at patients' homes. It means that they could simplify the&#xD;
      therapist's work in terms of the planning, design, and management of the cognitive&#xD;
      intervention also outside from the clinical setting. However, some concerns have slowed the&#xD;
      integration of home-based interventions into clinical practice, such as the fact that people&#xD;
      with advanced age or cognitive deficit might have poor computer skills and difficulties&#xD;
      managing technological devices on their own. Thus, the overall efficacy of home-based CT&#xD;
      programs is still under debate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this frame, the primary goal of this single-blind randomized controlled trial is to assess&#xD;
      whether a home-based CT (Home CoRe) could offer comparable effects (non-inferiority trial) to&#xD;
      those of an in-person CT (CoRe). A secondary goal is to follow these effects with respect to&#xD;
      the evolution of cognitive decline. These two interventions are evaluated also in terms of&#xD;
      treatment adherence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both treatment protocols consist of 18 sessions (3 session/week, 45 minutes/day) of CT with&#xD;
      CoRe vs HomeCoRe software (training memory and logical-executive functions).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with mild dementia, early cognitive impairment (i.e., MCI and vascular cognitive&#xD;
      impairment (VCI)), and SCI are recruited from Neuropsychology/Alzheimer's Disease Assessment&#xD;
      Unit and Neurorehabilitation Unit of IRCCS Mondino Foundation. Patients' diagnosis is&#xD;
      formulated on the basis of a comprehensive neuropsychological evaluation (baseline cognitive&#xD;
      assessment - T0) according to the guidelines presented in the literature. The following&#xD;
      standardized tests assessing different domains are used:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  global cognitive function: Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and Montreal Montreal&#xD;
           Overall Cognitive Assessment (MoCA);&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  memory: verbal (Verbal Span; Digit Span) and spatial (Corsi's blocktapping test - CBTT)&#xD;
           span; verbal long-term memory (Logical Memory Test immediate and delayed recall; Rey's&#xD;
           15-word test immediate and delayed recall); spatial long-term memory (Rey Complex Figure&#xD;
           delayed recall - RCF-dr);&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  logical-executive functions: non-verbal reasoning (Raven's Matrices 1947 - RM47);&#xD;
           frontal functionality (Frontal Assessment Battery - FAB); semantic fluency (animals,&#xD;
           fruits, car brands), phonological fluency (FAS);&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  attention: visual selective attention (Attentive Matrices); simple speed processing and&#xD;
           complex attention (Trail Making Test parts A - TMT A and part B - TMT B);&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  visuospatial abilities: constructive apraxia Rey Complex Figure copy - RCF-copy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The same battery is also used at follow-up visits; parallel versions are applied when&#xD;
      available (verbal long-term memory tests), in order to avoid the learning effect. All the&#xD;
      test scores are corrected for age, sex, and education and compared with the values available&#xD;
      for the Italian population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the baseline, the cognitive reserve is assessed using Cognitive Reserve Index&#xD;
      questionnaire (CRIq). The patients' functional status is assessed using Activities of Daily&#xD;
      Living (ADL) and Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (IADL) at the baseline and at the&#xD;
      last follow-up visit after one year (T3). Moreover, mood is assessed using the Beck&#xD;
      Depression Inventory (BDI) at the baseline and at the follow-up visits (T1, T2 and T3), while&#xD;
      quality of life were assessed using the 36-Item Short Form Health Survey questionnaire&#xD;
      (SF-36) at the baseline and at the follow-up visits six months (T2) and one year (T3) after&#xD;
      training. Subjective evaluation of intervention success is also considered by means of the&#xD;
      Patient Global Impression of Change (PGIC) and the Patients Reported Outcome Measures&#xD;
      (PROMS), administered at T0 and T1. Treatment adherence is evaluated considering the number&#xD;
      of CT sessions carried out.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All the patients recruited undergo baseline cognitive assessment (T0). Patients who met the&#xD;
      inclusion and exclusion criteria are enrolled and randomly assigned to the experimental group&#xD;
      (Home CoRe) or control group (CoRe).&#xD;
