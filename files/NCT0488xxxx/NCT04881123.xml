  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is to assess the efficacy, safety and pharmacokinetic (PK) of SER150 administered&#xD;
      for 12 weeks as a 15 mg twice a day (BID) dose in participants with type 2 diabetes (T2D) and&#xD;
      macroalbuminuria in treatment with either an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI)&#xD;
      or an angiotensin receptor antagonist (ARB).&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel groups, multicenter pivotal&#xD;
      study assessing the efficacy and safety of 15 mg BID of SER150 in well-controlled adult T2D&#xD;
      participants with stable concomitant medications, diabetic kidney disease (DKD) and&#xD;
      macroalbuminuria in treatment with an ACEI or an ARB.&#xD;
&#xD;
