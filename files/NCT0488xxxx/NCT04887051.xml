      During the pandemic, it is important for people who are isolated in their homes to stay&#xD;
      inactive and exercise exercises in order to prevent their complaints from increasing due to&#xD;
      inactivity. Individuals with multiple sclerosis are outpatient or inpatient with home&#xD;
      exercise programs besides the rehabilitation practices. They are being monitored. It has been&#xD;
      reported the rehabilitation of individuals is that they need to comply with their home&#xD;
      exercise programs in order to contribute. However, very limited research studies suggest that&#xD;
      any method can be used as home exercise has examined whether it has increased compliance with&#xD;
      the program. However, examining the factors affecting the compliance of individuals with&#xD;
      Multiple sclerosis to the home exercise program. The study was not found either.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Multiple sclerosis is chronic and improves the quality of life of the person is a&#xD;
      neurological disease that decreases. Multiple Sclerosis in mobility and functional activities&#xD;
      cause restrictions in social and professional life, leading to different degrees of&#xD;
      disability. It is a disease that causes severe disability and impairs the quality of life.&#xD;
      MS, It is one of the most common diseases that cause disability, usually between the ages of&#xD;
      15-50. In recent years, combating disability caused by MS is the most important and has been&#xD;
      the main focus. Patients' life expectancy is gradually increasing, One of the important&#xD;
      reasons for this is symptomatic treatments and modern rehabilitation. It is said to have&#xD;
      applications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Depression affects approximately 50% of patients with MS. The social isolation caused by&#xD;
      quarantine may have increased depression. In MS, in combating spasticity, as well as&#xD;
      depression and chronic fatigue, regular exercise is important.&#xD;
&#xD;

    <description>The Barthel Scale/Index (BI) is an ordinal scale used to measure performance in activities of daily living (ADL). Ten variables describing ADL and mobility are scored, a higher number being a reflection of greater ability to function independently following hospital discharge.Time taken and physical assistance required to perform each item are used in determining the assigned value of each item. Time to administer- Self report: 2-5 minutes; Direct observation: 20 minutes. Each item is rated in terms of whether the patient can perform the task independently, with some assistance, or is dependent on help based on observation (0=unable, 1=needs help, 2=independent). The final score is x 5 to get a number on a 100 point score. Barthel scores are that scores of 0-20 indicate &quot;total&quot; dependency and 91-99 indicates &quot;slight&quot; dependency.</description>

    <description>The Functional Ambulation Categories (FAC) is a functional walking test that evaluates ambulation ability. This 6-point scale assesses ambulation status by determining how much human support the patient requires when walking, regardless of whether or not they use a personal assistive device. Functional Ambulation Classification (FAS): FAS is a valid and reliable scale that evaluates the physical support needed during walking over 6 scores between 0 and 5. It is scored according to the support needed by the patient through observation. Accordingly, the scores; 0- It cannot be ambulatory alone, except for the parallel bar, the patient needs the help of at least 2 people in order to be ambulatory. 5- It walks independently on all floors.</description>

    <measure>Fatigue Severity Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>1st assesment: At first day (baseline avaluation); 2nd assesment: Change from baseline FSS score at 1 month after the program start. 3rd assesment: Change from baseline FSS score at 2 month after the program start</time_frame>
    <description>The Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS) is designed to differentiate fatigue from clinical depression, since both share some of the same symptoms. Essentially, the FSS consists of answering a short questionaire that requires the subject to rate his or her own level of fatigue. The obvious problem with this measure is its subjectivity.A self-report scale of nine items about fatigue, its severity and how it affects certain activities. Answers are scored on a seven point scale where 1 = strongly disagree and 7 = strongly agree. This means the minimum score possible is nine and the highest is 63. The higher the score, the more severe the fatigue is and the more it affects the person's activities. It is simple to understand and takes an average of eight minutes to answer.</description>
