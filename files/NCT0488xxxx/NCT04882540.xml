    <description>An adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation subject administered a pharmaceutical product that does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational) product, whether or not related to the medicinal (investigational) product.&#xD;
Treatment-emergent AEs (TEAEs) will be defined as those events that start on or after the time of first IMP administration, or whose severity worsens on or after the date of first administration of the IMP.</description>
