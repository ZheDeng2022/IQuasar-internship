  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall goals of the study are to deepen understanding of the spectrum of stigma&#xD;
      experienced by YLHIV in Vietnam, to develop a multi-level stigma intervention for YLHIV&#xD;
      delivered by telephone, and to evaluate the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary&#xD;
      efficacy of the intervention on intra- and inter-personal stigma, psychological wellbeing,&#xD;
      and treatment adherence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The project has the following Specific Aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Adapt a psychosocial stigma-reduction intervention for YLHIV in Vietnam based on&#xD;
           cognitive-behavioral therapy principles and delivered by telephone, using input from&#xD;
           youth during intervention development.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Assess the feasibility, acceptability and preliminary efficacy of this innovative&#xD;
           approach to reduce stigma, and improve psychosocial wellbeing and ART adherence among&#xD;
           YLHIV through a small pre-post study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Explore the multiple facets of stigma experienced by YLHIV in Vietnam and their&#xD;
           relationships with ART adherence and psychosocial wellbeing via quantitative surveys and&#xD;
           electronic adherence monitoring.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will assess the feasibility and acceptability of this approach among YLVIV in&#xD;
      Vietnam, and generate preliminary evidence for the potential effect of the intervention on&#xD;
      important endpoints including stigma, psychosocial wellbeing, adherence, CD4 count, and viral&#xD;
      load (VL).&#xD;

      For the pilot, we will recruit YLHIV on ART who self-report intrapersonal stigma and&#xD;
      implement a 12-week pre-post intervention study in which participants will receive the&#xD;
      phone-based intervention developed in the first phase. YLHIV will use an electronic adherence&#xD;
      monitoring device for their ART medications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the pre-post intervention study, each of 40 patients will be followed for a total of 16&#xD;
      weeks. All patient subjects will be given an eCAP wireless pill container (WPC) that will be&#xD;
      used to measure their adherence throughout the 16-week period. Study participation will&#xD;
      involve two phases, with the following activities:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Adherence monitoring, pre-intervention period (Weeks 1-2). Once enrolled, we will provide&#xD;
      each subject with a WPC and instruction on correct use. We will select one medication for&#xD;
      each WPC. While subjects continue to receive care as usual, we will collect their adherence&#xD;
      data using the WPC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Intervention period (Weeks 3-12). The intervention will be implemented for about 10&#xD;
      weeks; adherence data will be collected via WPCs through Week 16. They will remain blinded to&#xD;
      the adherence information generated by the devices, as will their care providers.&#xD;
