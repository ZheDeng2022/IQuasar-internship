          2. Subjects must have histologically and/or cytologically confirmed NSCLC&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Subjects must have incurable (advanced or metastatic) disease at the time of enrolment&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Subjects must have an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance Status of&#xD;
             0 or 1&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Subjects must provide signed informed consent prior to any study specific procedures&#xD;
             that are not part of standard medical care.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Subjects must have measurable neoplastic disease based on the RECIST 1.1 criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Subjects must have received as least 1 and no more than 2 prior systemic regimens for&#xD;
             the treatment of advanced/metastatic NSCLC. Patients are required to have progressed&#xD;
             following treatment with both platinum-based chemotherapy and an anti-PD-(L)1 antibody&#xD;
             administered either sequentially or concurrently. A prior PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitor is,&#xD;
             however, not required if there was prior exposure to targeted therapies for a driver&#xD;
             mutation positive tumors (e.g. EGFR or ALK inhibitors).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Subjects with active infection requiring treatment within 3 days of C1D1.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Subjects with other active neoplastic disease requiring concurrent anti-neoplastic&#xD;
             treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Subjects with known, suspected or documented parenchymal brain metastases unless&#xD;
             treated with surgery and/or radiation, with the subject neurologically stable and off&#xD;
             pharmacologic doses of systemic glucocorticoids; subjects with leptomeningeal&#xD;
             metastases are not eligible. Patients should have completed brain radiation for at&#xD;
             least 14 days and be off steroids per exclusion criteria 7.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Active or previously documented autoimmune or inflammatory disorders such as, but not&#xD;
             limited to rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, uveitis, ulcerative&#xD;
             colitis, Crohn's syndrome, Wegener's syndrome, multiple sclerosis, myasthenia gravis,&#xD;
             scleroderma and sarcoidosis. The following are exceptions to this criterion:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Vitiligo or psoriasis not requiring systemic treatment (within the last 2 years)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Subjects with endocrinopathies (e.g. following Hashimoto syndrome) stable on&#xD;
                  hormone replacement or do not require any therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. History of primary immunodeficiency&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Subjects with a history or prior allogeneic organ transplant&#xD;
