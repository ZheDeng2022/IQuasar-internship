  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the proposed project is to evaluate an automated mobile phone-based CM&#xD;
      approach that will allow socioeconomically disadvantaged individuals to remotely benefit from&#xD;
      financial incentives for smoking cessation. The investigators have previously combined&#xD;
      technologies including 1) portable carbon monoxide monitors that connect with mobile phones&#xD;
      to remotely verify smoking abstinence, 2) facial recognition software to confirm participant&#xD;
      identity during breath sample submissions, and 3) remote delivery of incentives automatically&#xD;
      triggered by biochemical confirmation of self-reported abstinence. This automated CM approach&#xD;
      will be evaluated in a randomized controlled trial that includes 532 socioeconomically&#xD;
      disadvantaged males and females seeking smoking cessation treatment. Participants will be&#xD;
      randomly assigned to either telephone counseling and nicotine replacement therapy (standard&#xD;
      care [SC]) or SC plus a mobile financial incentives intervention (CM) for&#xD;
      biochemically-confirmed abstinence. Participants will be followed for 26 weeks after a&#xD;
      scheduled quit attempt. Biochemically-verified 7-day point prevalence abstinence at 26 weeks&#xD;
      post-quit will be the primary outcome variable. Cost-effectiveness will be evaluated to&#xD;
      inform policy-related decisions. Potential mobile CM treatment mechanisms, including&#xD;
      self-efficacy, motivation, and treatment engagement, will be explored to optimize future&#xD;
      versions of the intervention.&#xD;

      The primary purpose of the proposed project is to evaluate an automated smartphone-based CM&#xD;
      approach that will allow socioeconomically disadvantaged adults to earn financial incentives&#xD;
      for smoking cessation without requiring in-person attendance for abstinence verification. The&#xD;
      investigators have combined technologies: 1) low-cost carbon monoxide monitors that connect&#xD;
      with mobile phones to remotely verify smoking abstinence, 2) facial recognition software to&#xD;
      verify the identity of participants while they provide a breath sample, and 3) remote and&#xD;
      automated delivery of incentives to a credit card triggered by biochemical confirmation of&#xD;
      self-reported smoking abstinence. This CM approach will be evaluated in a randomized&#xD;
      controlled trial of 532 socioeconomically disadvantaged males and females seeking smoking&#xD;
      cessation treatment. Participants will be randomly assigned to telephone counseling plus&#xD;
      nicotine replacement therapy (standard care [SC]) or SC plus a 12-week smartphone-based&#xD;
      financial incentives intervention (CM). Participants will be followed for 26 weeks after a&#xD;
      scheduled quit attempt, which is 14 weeks after incentives have ended. Cost-effectiveness&#xD;
      will be evaluated to inform policy and health care decisions. Potential CM treatment&#xD;
      mechanisms, including self-efficacy, motivation, and treatment engagement will be identified&#xD;
      to optimize future versions of the intervention. The specific aims are: 1) to evaluate the&#xD;
      impact of an automated, mobile phone-based CM approach relative to SC on smoking cessation&#xD;
      among socioeconomically disadvantaged adults, 2) to compare the cost-effectiveness of two&#xD;
      smoking cessation interventions (CM vs. SC), and 3) to identify mobile CM treatment&#xD;
      mechanisms such as motivation to quit, self-efficacy for quitting, and treatment&#xD;
      engagement/adherence. The proposed study will evaluate an intervention approach that&#xD;
      increases the reach of a potentially effective and cost-effective smoking cessation&#xD;
      intervention for socioeconomically disadvantaged smokers.&#xD;

The ICER is then compared with published threshold values for cost-effective interventions. The cost model will include all necessary personnel, hardware, and material costs.</description>
