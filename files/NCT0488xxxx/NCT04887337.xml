  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Each year within Canada and the US, more than 30,000 children and adolescents will have an&#xD;
      injury to their shoulder resulting in a shoulder dislocation. Although the current practice&#xD;
      is to manage this initial dislocation without surgery, the vast majority of these children&#xD;
      and adolescents will, unfortunately continue to have instability episodes of their shoulder.&#xD;
      Recurrent instability can cause damage to the bones and cartilage that form the shoulder&#xD;
      resulting in potentially more difficult surgical stabilization, and possibly long-term&#xD;
      sequela. To that effect, there is increasing interest to consider early surgical&#xD;
      stabilization in this population. This pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT) will evaluate&#xD;
      the feasibility of conducting a larger RCT assessing the effect of early arthroscopic&#xD;
      stabilization compared to rehabilitation on the rate of repeat shoulder dislocations&#xD;
      (recurrent instability), pain, and shoulder function among adolescents (aged 12-18 years)&#xD;
      with first-time shoulder dislocations. These patients will be followed for one year.&#xD;

    <description>The Pediatric and Adolescent Shoulder and Elbow Survey has recently been adopted as a shoulder and elbow function scale designed specifically for children and adolescents aged 10-18, and has shown to be well received and understood in this age group. The total score - 100 maximum points - is weighted 50% for pain and 50% for function.</description>

    <description>Patients will have an initial evaluation with a diagnostic shoulder arthroscopy and examination under anesthesia will be performed to confirm the degree of anterior instability and assess range of motion of the affected shoulder. Diagnostic arthroscopy will commence with the use of 3 standard shoulder portals (posterior viewing and two anterior working portals for suture passing), and a detailed arthroscopic examination will be performed. Once the soft tissue tear (including the labrum, and capsule labrum ligaments) is identified, it will be mobilized using a rasp or elevator and a burr will then be used to create a surface for a bleeding bone bed. Capsulolabral repair will then commence with the labrum fixed to the glenoid using suture anchors (the Bankart repair). Following surgery, subjects in this group will follow the same rehabilitation protocol as the comparison group.</description>

    <arm_group_label>Rehabilitation including a period of immobilization followed by physical therapy</arm_group_label>
    <arm_group_type>Active Comparator</arm_group_type>
    <description>Subjects in this group will use an internal-rotation shoulder immobilizer, using a standard sling for 6 weeks from the day of enrollment. Subjects will be advised to maintain range of motion (ROM) in the elbow and wrist during this period of time. The immobilizer can be removed for passive pendulum exercises and elbow ROM during the period of immobilization up to 4 times per day. Formal physiotherapy commences at 4 weeks post-enrollment, with a goal of return to activities or sport at 6-months post-enrollment.</description>
