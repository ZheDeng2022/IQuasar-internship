      Mixed venous saturation (SvO2) is an indicator of the balance between oxygen supply and&#xD;
      demand in the body's tissues Recently, our research team published a paper describing the&#xD;
      possibility to continuously monitor SvO2 by the use of continuous dynamic capnography&#xD;
      (Karlsson et al, A Continuous Noninvasive Method to Assess Mixed Venous Oxygen Saturation: A&#xD;
      Proof-of-Concept Study in Pigs. Anesth Analg 2020) The primary objective of the current study&#xD;
      is thus to investigate the agreement and trending ability for capnodynamically derived SvO2&#xD;
      against the gold standard CO-oximetry. The secondary objective is to investigate the&#xD;
      agreement and trending ability for capnodynamically derived CO (COEPBF) against the modified&#xD;
      CO2-Fick method.&#xD;

      Background: Mixed venous saturation (SvO2) is an indicator of the balance between oxygen&#xD;
      supply and demand in the body's tissues The primary objective of the current study is thus to&#xD;
      investigate the agreement and trending ability for capnodynamically derived SvO2 against the&#xD;
      gold standard CO-oximetry. The secondary objective is to investigate the agreement and&#xD;
      trending ability for capnodynamically derived CO (COEPBF) against the modified CO2-Fick&#xD;
      method.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The rationale of capnodynamic SvO2 (capno-SvO2) can be briefly described as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Capno-SvO2 method is based on differential Fick's principle and utilizes a combination of&#xD;
      continuous estimation of Effective Pulmonary Blood Flow (COEPBF) and oxygen consumption (VO2)&#xD;
      incorporated in a rearranged Fick's equation. COEPBF is estimated by applying a special&#xD;
      breathing pattern of variations in I:E relationships (six breaths with normal I:E relations&#xD;
      followed by three breaths vid an approximately 2 s expiratory pause). This breathing pattern&#xD;
      causes small fluctuations in alveolar CO2 concentration and VCO2, related to the pulmonary&#xD;
      blood flow participating in gas exchange which allows for estimation of COEPBF. VO2 can be&#xD;
      estimated using continuous volumetric capnography measurement of VCO2 combined with the&#xD;
      Respiratory Quotient (RQ).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Modified CO2-Fick: CO estimation using modified CO2-Fick is assessed by incorporating&#xD;
      measured CO2 content in mixed venous and arterial blood into the equation below where VCO2 is&#xD;
      estimated using volumetric capnography.&#xD;
&#xD;
      COFick=VCO2/(CvCO2-CcCO2)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study protocol&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients planned for percutaneous intervention of cardiac conditions at our department&#xD;
      will be screened for inclusion in this study. Exclusion criteria: ongoing ECMO treatment or&#xD;
      intracardiac shunts not subjected to intervention. All these patients are routinely&#xD;
      anaesthetized, intubated with a cuffed endotracheal tube and kept on controlled ventilation,&#xD;
      a prerequisite for the capnodynamic method.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After induction of anesthesia, the special breathing pattern will be applied and continuous&#xD;
      data from the capnodynamic monitoring will be collected. After catheterization of the&#xD;
      pulmonary artery two baseline blood gases from the PAC and arterial line will be drawn and&#xD;
      analyzed, and the hemoglobin level (Hb) from this sample will be used for calibration of the&#xD;
      capnodynamic method together with a tabulated RQ. After completion of the interventional&#xD;
      procedure, a sequence of paired testing of SvO2 from blood gases drawn from the pulmonary&#xD;
      artery and arterial line. Firstly 2 samples (3 min apart) forming a baseline. After this&#xD;
      follows a short increase in PEEP (3 cmH2O to 8cmH2O), which temporarily decreases cardiac&#xD;
      output and SvO2. A sample is collected and then once more after PEEP has been brought back to&#xD;
      3 cmH2O after 3 minutes. Next, a raised level of inhaled oxygen from 30 to 80% (FiO2) is&#xD;
      applied for 3 minutes and then turned back to baseline. Mixed venous and arterial samples&#xD;
      will be drawn at FiO2 30% and 80%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Paired recordings of COEPBF and CO2-Fick as well as capnodynamic SvO2 and co-oximetry will be&#xD;
      examined for agreement and ability to detect change using Bland-Altman and four quadrant&#xD;
      plots.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Power analyses (power 80% and alfa of 0.05) implies a minimal of 120 paired recordings&#xD;
      corresponding to approximately 20 patients. 30 patients will be included for upward margin.&#xD;
