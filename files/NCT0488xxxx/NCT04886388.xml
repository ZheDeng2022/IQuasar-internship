  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      BT-001 is a software program intended to help patients with type 2 diabetes, under the&#xD;
      guidance of their physician, improve glycemic control (i.e., levels of blood sugar). The&#xD;
      BT-001 software delivers a type of behavioral therapy to patients via a mobile application&#xD;
      that targets behaviors related to achieving glycemic control. The effectiveness of BT-001&#xD;
      will be measured by its ability to help patients reduce Hemoglobin A1c, or HbA1c (a marker in&#xD;
      the blood that measures blood sugar) compared to standard medical care in patients with type&#xD;
      2 diabetes.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will utilize an open-label, randomized, parallel-group design to confirm and&#xD;
      characterize the safety and efficacy of BT-001 used in addition to standard of care (SOC)&#xD;
      when compared to SOC alone in patients with type 2 diabetes. The screening period will&#xD;
      consist of a run-in during which time HbA1c will be assessed for confirmation of eligibility.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once confirmed to be eligible, patients will then be randomized 1:1 to the following groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigational: One half of the participants will be treated with BT-001 plus SOC for 180&#xD;
      days;&#xD;
&#xD;
      Control: One half of the participants will be treated with SOC alone for 180 days.&#xD;
