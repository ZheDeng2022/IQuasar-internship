  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Understanding how co-morbidities in persons with HIV (PWH) such as substance use affect&#xD;
      risk-taking, decision-making, and other cognitive behaviors is important given implications&#xD;
      for everyday functioning and transmission risk. The high prevalence of cannabis use in PWH,&#xD;
      medicinally and recreationally, may indicate disease severity, impart therapeutic benefits,&#xD;
      or adverse consequences. In fact, cannabis is recommended to those with HIV to alleviate&#xD;
      nausea, improve appetite, relieve pain, and lift mood. To-date, the consequences of cannabis&#xD;
      use in PWH remain unclear as do potential interactions with HIV treatments. In healthy&#xD;
      participants, heavy cannabis use is associated with cognitive deficits e.g., risky&#xD;
      decision-making, response disinhibition and inattention, but pro-cognitive effects in PWH may&#xD;
      exist at mild use levels due to its anti-inflammatory and anti-excitotoxic properties.&#xD;
      Furthermore, little has been done to determine the effects of cannabis use on the&#xD;
      endocannabinoid (EC) system in general or in PWH. This study will determine the effects of&#xD;
      the two primary cannabis constituents (Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol [THC], cannabidiol [CBD]) vs.&#xD;
      placebo on risky decision-making, response inhibition, reward learning, temporal perception,&#xD;
      and motivation, plus EC and homovanillic acid (HVA; a surrogate for dopamine activity) levels&#xD;
      in HIV+ and HIV- subjects. Participants with infrequent cannabis use will undergo baseline&#xD;
      cognitive testing and biomarker assays with antiretrovirals (ART) use quantified. They will&#xD;
      be randomized to a 5-day course of either THC, CBD, or placebo and return for follow-up&#xD;
      testing and re-assaying of ECs and HVA levels.&#xD;

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Aged 18 and older&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Possess the capacity to provide informed consent to a set of neurobehavioral,&#xD;
             neuromedical and cognitive assessment procedures. Individuals unable to provide such&#xD;
             consent will not be enrolled into the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  HIV Status: HIV status will be determined using the MedMira Rapid Test (Halifax, Nova&#xD;
             Scotia, Canada). If the result differs from the participant's self-report a&#xD;
             confirmatory Western Blot will be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Infrequent use of cannabis, defined as 1-4 times per month. Must have used cannabis at&#xD;
             least five times in the past two years without an adverse reaction.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Willing to abstain from cannabis for at least 2 days prior the baseline visit.&#xD;
             Although there is no definitive method for determining abstinence over this period,&#xD;
             abstinence will be confirmed as best as possible by using an oral fluid testing device&#xD;
             (Draeger 5000) employed by law enforcement officers to detect recent cannabis use. An&#xD;
             oral fluid value of &gt; 5ng suggests recent use, although in some cases it has been&#xD;
             reported that individuals may show &gt; 5ng up to 20 hours after use. Thus, should the&#xD;
             oral fluid sample indicate &gt; 5ng THC, the assessment may be canceled and rescheduled.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Inability to provide informed consent&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Significant chronic renal disease (unrelated to HIV), significant chronic pulmonary&#xD;
             disease (unrelated to HIV), or Hepatitis C Virus infection&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Head injury with loss of consciousness for greater than 30 minutes or resulting in&#xD;
             neurologic complications&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Seizure disorder&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Demyelinating diseases or other non-HIV neurological disorders&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnancy&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Acute or recent or previous clinically disabling stroke or previous cerebrovascular&#xD;
             events&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Lifetime history of schizophrenia or other psychotic disorders, or bipolar disorder.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II) score is greater than or equal to 29 (severe&#xD;
             depression) or suicidal ideas are endorsed on the BDI-II or a Center for&#xD;
             Epidemiological Studies-Depression Scale (CES-D) subscale measuring suicidal ideation&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Alcohol use disorder (moderate or severe) within the last 12 months&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  For other substances besides alcohol and cannabis, moderate or severe substance use&#xD;
             disorder within the past five years or a mild substance use disorder within the past&#xD;
             12 months.&#xD;
