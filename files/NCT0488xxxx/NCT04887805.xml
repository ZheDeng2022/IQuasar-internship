      This phase II trial studies the effects of lenvatinib and pembrolizumab maintenance therapy&#xD;
      in treating patients with pancreatic cancer that has spread to other places in the body&#xD;
      (advanced) and cannot be removed by surgery (unresectable). Lenvatinib may stop the growth of&#xD;
      tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Immunotherapy with&#xD;
      monoclonal antibodies, such as pembrolizumab, may help the body's immune system attack the&#xD;
      cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Giving&#xD;
      lenvatinib and pembrolizumab may be effective as a maintenance therapy in patients with&#xD;
      pancreatic cancer.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate the progression free survival (PFS) of lenvatinib mesylate&#xD;
      (lenvatinib)-pembrolizumab as maintenance therapy in patients with advanced unresectable&#xD;
      pancreatic cancer who have achieved partial response or stable disease following 1st or 2nd&#xD;
      line therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate the safety and tolerability associated with the combination of&#xD;
      lenvatinib-pembrolizumab as maintenance therapy for patients with advanced unresectable&#xD;
      pancreatic cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To evaluate the overall response rate (ORR), including confirmed and unconfirmed,&#xD;
      complete and partial response and duration of response, of patients treated with&#xD;
      lenvatinib-pembrolizumab in the subset of patients with measurable disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To evaluate if potential gains in PFS translates into an overall survival (OS) benefit&#xD;
      for patients with pancreatic cancer being treated with lenvatinib-pembrolizumab in the&#xD;
      maintenance setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I .To investigate whether lenvatinib-pembrolizumab induces measurable immune-related systemic&#xD;
      changes in peripheral blood over the course of therapy by flow cytometry using T cell markers&#xD;
      (e.g. CD4+, CD8+, PD1, TIM-3, LAG-3, TOX nuclear factor).&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To conduct an exploratory study to identify global changes in expression of tumor-related&#xD;
      genes using needle biopsy samples of PDA tumors obtained prior to and within one week after&#xD;
      the 3rd cycle of pembrolizumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive pembrolizumab intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on day 1 and lenvatinib&#xD;
      mesylate orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-21. Cycles repeat every 21 days in the absence&#xD;
      of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days and then up to 1&#xD;
      year.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Subjects having &gt; 1+ proteinuria on urine dipstick testing unless a 24-hour urine&#xD;
