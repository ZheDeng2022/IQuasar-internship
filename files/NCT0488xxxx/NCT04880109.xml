  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase 2 study is to assess the safety and tolerability of APX-115 active doses compared&#xD;
      to placebo following multiple oral dosing in hospitalized patients with confirmed, mild to&#xD;
      moderate, symptomatic COVID-19. It is anticipated that approximately 80 patients will be&#xD;
      randomized into the study in a 1:1 ratio to 100 mg APX-115 or placebo arm.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      APX-115 is a potent small molecule inhibitor of NADPH-oxidase (Nox) isozymes being developed&#xD;
      by Aptabio Therapeutics Inc. The Nox enzymes represent a family of 7 membrane enzymes (Nox1,&#xD;
      Nox2, Nox3, Nox4, Nox5, Duox1, and Duox2) which catalyze NADPH-dependent generation of&#xD;
      superoxide and secondary reactive oxygen species (ROS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      ROS are often generated during virus infection, thus promoting apoptosis, lung injury, and&#xD;
      inflammation/allergy.&#xD;
