  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sarcopenia is associated with reduced pulmonary function in healthy adults, as well as with&#xD;
      increased risk of pneumonia following abdominal surgery. Consequentially, postoperative&#xD;
      pneumonia prolongs hospital admission, and increases in-hospital mortality following a range&#xD;
      of surgical interventions. Little is known about the function of the diaphragm in the context&#xD;
      of sarcopenia and wasting disorders or how its function is influenced by abdominal surgery.&#xD;
      Liver surgery induces reactive pleural effusion in most patients, compromising post-operative&#xD;
      pulmonary function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypotheses:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Both major hepatic resection and sarcopenia have a measurable impact on diaphragm&#xD;
           function.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Sarcopenia is associated with reduced preoperative diaphragm function, and that patients&#xD;
           with reduced preoperative diaphragm function show a greater decline and reduced recovery&#xD;
           of diaphragm function following major hepatic resection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Goals:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary goal of this study is to evaluate whether sarcopenic patients have a reduced&#xD;
      diaphragm function prior to major liver resection compared to non-sarcopenic patients, and to&#xD;
      evaluate whether sarcopenic patients show a greater reduction in respiratory muscle function&#xD;
      following major liver resection when compared to non-sarcopenic patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods and analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Trans-costal B-mode, M-mode ultrasound and speckle tracking imaging will be used to assess&#xD;
      diaphragm function perioperatively in patients undergoing major hepatic resection starting&#xD;
      one day prior to surgery and up to thirty days after surgery. In addition, rectus abdominis&#xD;
      and quadriceps femoris muscles thickness will be measured using ultrasound to measure&#xD;
      sarcopenia, and pulmonary function will be measured using a hand-held bedside spirometer.&#xD;
      Muscle mass will be determined preoperatively using CT-muscle volumetry of abdominal muscle&#xD;
      and adipose tissue at the third lumbar vertebra level (L3). Muscle function will be assessed&#xD;
      using handgrip strength and physical condition will be measured with a short physical&#xD;
      performance battery (SPPB). A rectus abdominis muscle biopsy will be taken intraoperatively&#xD;
      to measure proteolytic and mitochondrial activity as well as inflammation and redox status.&#xD;
      Systemic inflammation and sarcopenia biomarkers will be assessed in serum acquired&#xD;
      perioperatively.&#xD;
