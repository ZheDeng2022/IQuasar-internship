  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study showed that the addition of hippotherapy to Schroth exercises is more effective in&#xD;
      improving postural asymmetry and balance ability in adolescents with idiopathic scoliosis&#xD;
      compared to Schroth exercises alone. Therefore, this combination should be considered during&#xD;
      designing a rehabilitation program for AIS&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The hippotherapy program started with a physical therapy assessment to develop specific&#xD;
      corrective movements to be practiced while riding the horse based on the direction of the&#xD;
      spinal curvature. Interventions were performed by a licensed physical therapist experienced&#xD;
      with hippotherapy at two local therapeutic riding centers. The participants received 15&#xD;
      sessions split into two phases over 10 weeks. In the first phase, during the first 5 weeks,&#xD;
      they performed 30 minutes of walking and sitting trot training without a stirrup iron once a&#xD;
      week. The frequency was then raised to twice a week for the rest of the treatment program.&#xD;
      Before the start of the intervention, two familiarization sessions were given to clarify&#xD;
      safety guidelines, riding mistakes, and create a riding rapport with the horse. The&#xD;
      individuals wore protective helmets during each hippotherapy session and mounted on a moving&#xD;
      horse on walk and/or trot performing different positions, namely forward astride, side&#xD;
      sitting, backward astride, sometimes with transitions between positions and often while the&#xD;
      horse was moving. To restore normal alignment of the spine, participants were also asked to&#xD;
      ride without holding on with their hands to perform self-correction movements. Examples of&#xD;
      these movements include raising both arms high to decrease the degree of thoracic kyphosis,&#xD;
      bending the upper trunk towards the convex side of the curve, raising the arm on the concave&#xD;
      side with scapular adduction to level both shoulders. To correct pelvic obliquity, a small&#xD;
      pad was put under the hip on the side of the lumbar convexity. Under the instructions of the&#xD;
      physical therapist, a leader pulled the horse reins in front to control the horse gait, gait&#xD;
      velocity, and orient the horse in different directions . All these movements activate the&#xD;
      patient's neuromuscular and sensory reactions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both groups performed Schroth exercises that are patient-specific asymmetric exercises with&#xD;
      rotational breathing methods used for three-dimensional correction. For the first 2 weeks,&#xD;
      there were five 1-h long individual sessions during which the participants were trained in&#xD;
      their home exercise program. This was followed by 1-h weekly visits and paired with their&#xD;
      daily home exercises. These exercises aimed to provide and promote enhanced postural control&#xD;
      by using asymmetrical standing postural exercises specifically designed to restore body&#xD;
      balance and mobility. During ground exercises, aid pads were used to build pressure for&#xD;
      costal protrusions and/or trunk asymmetry correction. Postural correction was facilitated by&#xD;
      rotational breathing exercises focusing on the concave side of the thorax. During the therapy&#xD;
      sessions, postural correction principles of the Schroth process, axial elongation,&#xD;
      deflection, de-rotation, facilitation, stabilization, were used.&#xD;
