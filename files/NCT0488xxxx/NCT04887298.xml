    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center, open-label, single-arm study that in Phase 1b will determine the&#xD;
      maximum tolerated dose (MTD)/ recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) and safety of L-Annamycin and&#xD;
      in Phase 2 will explore the efficacy of L- Annamycin as a single agent for the treatment of&#xD;
      subjects with STS with lung metastases for which chemotherapy is considered appropriate.&#xD;

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. The subject has a pathologically confirmed diagnosis of STS and documented lung&#xD;
             metastases that are considered eligible for chemotherapy and not eligible for&#xD;
             potentially curative surgical resection of pulmonary-only metastatic disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. The subject had prior anthracycline therapy (cumulative dose of ≤450 mg/m2) for their&#xD;
             disease and has shown progression of disease prior to study entry.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. The subject must have measurable disease in the lung, defined as at a minimum, 1&#xD;
             lesion that can be accurately measured in at least one dimension of &gt;10 mm. Subjects&#xD;
             with extra-pulmonary disease are eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. The subject has an estimated life expectancy of greater than 3 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. The subject has an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status ≤2.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. The subject is ≥18 years old at the time of signing informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. At least 2 weeks must have passed following treatment for their disease with&#xD;
             chemotherapy, investigational therapy, targeted agents, biological agents, immune&#xD;
             modulators, or radiotherapy, and any toxicities must have resolved to ≤ grade 1 or&#xD;
             previous baseline levels no more than 4 weeks after completing therapy (except&#xD;
             alopecia and polyneuropathy).&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. The subject must have adequate laboratory results including the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Absolute neutrophil count ≥ 1500/mL and platelets ≥100,000/mL&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Hemoglobin ≥ 8.0 g/dL&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. Adequate renal function (The Cockcroft-Gault equation will be used to estimate&#xD;
                  creatinine clearance. This equation is as follows: Creatinine clearance in&#xD;
                  milliliters per minute = [140-age] x body weight [kg]/72 x plasma creatinine&#xD;
                  [mg/dL]; multiplied by 0.85 for women. By using this equation, adequate renal&#xD;
                  function will be deemed to be a creatinine clearance of greater than 60&#xD;
                  mL/minute)&#xD;
&#xD;
               4. Bilirubin ≤1.5 x upper limit of normal (ULN) (unless due to Gilbert's syndrome)&#xD;
&#xD;
               5. Aspartate aminotransferase (serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase) and/or&#xD;
                  alanine aminotransferase (serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase) ≤ 2.5 × ULN (≤ 5 x&#xD;
                  ULN in subjects with liver metastases)&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. The subject is able to understand and sign the informed consent document, can&#xD;
             communicate with the Investigator, and can understand and comply with the requirements&#xD;
             of the protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. All subjects (men and women) agree to practice effective contraception during the&#xD;
             entire study period and after discontinuing study drug, unless documentation of&#xD;
             infertility exists.&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Sexually active, fertile women must use 2 effective forms of contraception&#xD;
                  (abstinence, intrauterine device, oral contraceptive, or double barrier device)&#xD;
                  from the time of informed consent and until at least 6 months after discontinuing&#xD;
                  study drug&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Sexually active men and their sexual partners must use effective contraceptive&#xD;
                  methods from the time of informed consent until at least 6 months after&#xD;
                  discontinuing study drug&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. The subject has any condition that, in the opinion of the Investigator, places the&#xD;
             subject at unacceptable risk if they were to participate in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. The subject has left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) &lt;50%, valvular heart&#xD;
             disease, or severe hypertension not controlled by medical therapy. Cardiac subjects&#xD;
             with a New York Heart Association classification of 3 or 4 will be excluded, as will&#xD;
             those with recent (≤ 6 months) myocardial infarction, unstable angina, or symptomatic&#xD;
             congestive heart failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. The subject has a baseline QT/QTc interval &gt;480 msec, a history of additional risk&#xD;
             factors for torsade des pointes (e.g., heart failure, hypokalemia, family history of&#xD;
             Long QT Syndrome) and use of concomitant medications that significantly prolong the&#xD;
             QT/QTc interval.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. The subject has clinically relevant serious comorbid medical conditions including, but&#xD;
             not limited to active infection, known positive status for human immunodeficiency&#xD;
             virus or active hepatitis B or C, cirrhosis, or psychiatric illness/social situations&#xD;
             that would limit compliance with study requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. The subject is pregnant, lactating, or not using adequate contraception.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. The subject has a known allergy to study drug or excipients.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. The subject is required to use moderate or strong inhibitors and inducers of&#xD;
             Cytochrome P450 family enzymes CYP3A and CYP2B and transporters that cannot be held 3&#xD;
             days before treatment and on the day of treatment.&#xD;
