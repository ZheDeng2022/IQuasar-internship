  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Self-tonometry with iCare Home is performed by one hundred patients annually at Sankt Erik's&#xD;
      Eye Hospital. We want to evaluate the impact that self-tonometry results have on the&#xD;
      clinician's choice of glaucoma treatment. We also want to evaluate how often pressure peaks&#xD;
      occur outside the clinic's opening hours.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Since a few years back, self-tonometry has been available in glaucoma care. Self-tonometry&#xD;
      allows patients to measure their eye pressure themselves using a portable tonometer. Sankt&#xD;
      Erik's Eye Hospital was the first healthcare provider in Sweden to use this new technology.&#xD;
      We have previously conducted studies that have shown good agreement between the measurements&#xD;
      made by patients and the gold standard method, e.g. Goldman applanation tonometry (GAT)&#xD;
      (Chen, Querat et al. 2016, Querat and Chen 2017). About one hundred patients perform pressure&#xD;
      curves with self-tonometry annually.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As the method is used regularly, we want to evaluate the impact of self-tonometry results on&#xD;
      the clinician's choice of glaucoma treatment. We also want to evaluate how often pressure&#xD;
      peaks occur outside the clinic's opening hours and how much they differ from GAT.&#xD;
