  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Coronavirus Disease 19 (COVID-19) is a worldwide pandemic and a major global health concern&#xD;
      which is caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The newly&#xD;
      emerged Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which was first identified in Wuhan, China, has&#xD;
      swept through 219 countries, killing a staggering number of people. According to WHO reports,&#xD;
      the number of deaths had risen to 3,155,168by March 30, 2021, out of 149,910,744 confirmed&#xD;
      cases. In Bangladesh, the outbreak has infected over 745,322confirmed cases, with over 11,053&#xD;
      deaths reported. Though the patient may be asymptomatic or present with mild symptoms,&#xD;
      mortality is quite high in the severe form of the disease which often progresses to critical&#xD;
      phase presented as Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS). This is due to exaggerated&#xD;
      response of immune system to the virus termed as cytokine storm syndrome (CSS). There is&#xD;
      currently no effective antiviral therapy for SARS-CoV-2 and supportive care is the mainstay&#xD;
      of therapy. As a result we are still searching for a better therapeutic agent which will help&#xD;
      in treating Covid-19 cases in terms of mortality, morbidity, oxygen requirement, length of&#xD;
      stay in hospital. Co-trimoxazole (composed of one-part Trimethoprim and five parts&#xD;
      Sulfamethoxazole)is a sulphur containing anti-folate bactericidal drug which is being used&#xD;
      for over 60 years for various indications esp. respiratory tract infections. It is known to&#xD;
      have immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory properties that may help to prevent progression&#xD;
      to critical phase and cytokine storm syndrome in severe COVID-19 patients. It acts rapidly&#xD;
      when given in high dose due to its better bioavailability and lung penetration. Low cost and&#xD;
      a good safety profile can make it an ideal candidate for treatment of COVID -19 in a low&#xD;
      resource country like Bangladesh.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods and materials:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This interventional double-blind place controlled randomized trial will be conducted in the&#xD;
      department of medicine at Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Medical University (BSMMU) for a duration&#xD;
      of 6 months following approval of this protocol. It will recruit at least 94 consecutive&#xD;
      adults (18 years or older) patients with clinically suspected COVID-19 and severe illness as&#xD;
      per WHO criteria. After taking informed written consent patients will be randomly assigned in&#xD;
      a 1:1 ratio to either oral high dose co-trimoxazole in addition to standard therapy or&#xD;
      placebo along with standard therapy. Baseline characteristics, changes in the physiological&#xD;
      and biochemical parameters like (SpO2/FiO2 ratio, respiratory rate, body temperature and C -&#xD;
      reactive protein), length of hospital stay, side effects of drugs, requirement for&#xD;
      ventilatory support (non-invasive and invasive ventilation) and 28- day mortality between the&#xD;
      two groups will be compared. Data will be collected from case record forms, anonymised and&#xD;
      stored securely in a secure online web based portal. Statistical analysis will be performed&#xD;
      using t-test or Mann -Whitney U test or Wilcoxon signed rank test for continuous variables&#xD;
      and Chi- square test or Fisher's exact test for categorical variables. Survival will be&#xD;
      assessed by the Kaplan-Meier method. Comparisons between two groups will be performed using&#xD;
      the log-rank test. A p-value of &lt; 0.05 will be considered to be significant. The statistical&#xD;
      software SPSS version 25 will be used for the analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Conclusion If the results from this clinical trial demonstrate the beneficial effects of high&#xD;
      co-trimoxazole in patients with severe COVID-19 it could help to reduce the need for&#xD;
      respiratory support for thousands of patients, saving valuable lives and decrease the burden&#xD;
      of healthcare system in countries with limited resources.&#xD;

      The newly emerged Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which was first identified in Wuhan,&#xD;
      China, has swept through 219 countries, killing a staggering number of people. The World&#xD;
      Health Organization (WHO) has declared the deadly outbreak a pandemic, with far-reaching&#xD;
      consequences for all people. According to WHO reports, the number of deaths had risen to&#xD;
      3,155,168by March 30, 2021, out of 149,910,744 confirmed cases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The pathogen for COVID-19 has been described as the severe acute respiratory syndrome&#xD;
      coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), a new beta-coronavirus. Following the outbreaks of the severe&#xD;
      acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) coronaviruses&#xD;
      in 2003 and 2012, respectively, this strain has been the third most deadly pathogenic human&#xD;
      coronavirus. In Bangladesh, the outbreak has infected over 745,322confirmed cases, with over&#xD;
      11,053 deaths reported.&#xD;
&#xD;
      COVID-19 is spread from person to person through respiratory droplets. The disease is&#xD;
      characterized by respiratory symptoms, the most common of which are fever, fatigue, myalgia,&#xD;
      dry cough, and dyspnea.&#xD;
&#xD;
      People with co-morbidities such as diabetes, cardiovascular and cerebrovascular disorders,&#xD;
      cancers, and pre-existing lung diseases such as Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD)&#xD;
      have been shown to have a greater risk of developing serious forms of the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Septic shock, coagulation disorders, Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS), multi-organ&#xD;
      failure, and even death may occur in people with serious illness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to recent research, the SARSCoV-2 envelope spike protein receptor binding domain&#xD;
      binds to the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors of the host cells, which are&#xD;
      mainly respiratory epithelial cells and alveolar pneumocytes type 2 (AT2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The virus then induces lysis of the infected cells, causing the release of proinflammatory&#xD;
      cytokines such as interleukin (IL) IL1, IL2, IL6, IL 7, interferon gamma, macrophage&#xD;
      inflammatory proteins, tumor necrosis factor alpha, and others, initiating the host's&#xD;
      inflammatory immune response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A cytokine storm syndrome (CSS) develops in patients with severe forms of the disease as a&#xD;
      result of the host's excessive immune response combined with continued lysis of the infected&#xD;
      cells. Damage Associated Molecular Patterns (DAMPs) released after mitochondrial injury in&#xD;
      host cells stimulate Formyl Peptide Receptors (FPRs) on the outer surface of neutrophils and&#xD;
      monocytes' cell membranes, causing their recruitment to the lungs. FPRs cause the release of&#xD;
      Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) in the tissue when stimulated, which leads to the release of&#xD;
      even more cytokines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This causes extensive tissue damage, causing mild respiratory symptoms like dry cough and&#xD;
      fever to quickly progress into Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome, followed by multiple&#xD;
      organ failure in susceptible patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A large, randomized clinical trial involving more than 6400 hospitalized patients with&#xD;
      Covid-19 showed that dexamethasone significantly reduced 30-day mortality (17% reduction);&#xD;
      benefit was limited to patients who required oxygen supplementation and appeared greater in&#xD;
      patients receiving mechanical ventilation.10 Consequently, dexamethasone (or potentially&#xD;
      other glucocorticoids) is now considered the standard of care for patients with severe&#xD;
      Covid-19. Data from a randomized, placebo-controlled trial involving more than 1000 patients&#xD;
      with severe Covid-19 showed that the antiviral agent remdesivir reduced time to clinical&#xD;
      recovery; the benefit appeared greatest in patients who were receiving supplemental oxygen&#xD;
      but were not intubated.11The combination of dexamethasone and remdesivir is increasingly used&#xD;
      clinically, but its benefit has not been shown in randomized clinical trials. Tocilizumab, an&#xD;
      interleukin-6 inhibitor, did not significantly reduce disease progression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore in managing severe Covid-19 patients physicians are still searching for better&#xD;
      options. The key to managing severe COVID-19 is to prevent this cytokine storm from&#xD;
      occurring, as well as to ensure that there are no secondary bacterial infections in the&#xD;
      patient's already compromised lungs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cotrimoxazole is a common antibiotic used to treat a variety of illnesses, including urinary&#xD;
      and respiratory tract infections and opportunistic pneumocystis pneumonia, and toxoplasmosis&#xD;
      in HIV/AIDS patients. Being composed of one-part Trimethoprim and five parts&#xD;
      Sulfamethoxazole, Cotrimoxazole is a low-cost drug with good effectiveness and a low risk of&#xD;
      side effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Many studies have shown that Cotrimoxazole has immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory&#xD;
      properties. In the ARROW trial, plasma pro-inflammatory markers like C reactive protein (CRP)&#xD;
      and Interleukin 6 were found to be lower in continuous Cotrimoxazole prophylaxis, implying&#xD;
      that it has anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory properties.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cotrimoxazole has been shown to block FPRs, preventing the recruitment of inflammatory cells,&#xD;
      the release of cytokines, and the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in damaged&#xD;
      tissue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cotrimoxazole has also been shown to be effective in lowering pro-inflammatory cytokines such&#xD;
      as IL-1, 2, 6, 8, and Tumor Necrosis Factor - α.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This could prevent the clinically serious COVID-19 from progressing to ARDS by preventing the&#xD;
      imminent CSS. In addition, the drug is very effective in treating nosocomial and&#xD;
      opportunistic infections. This could also help to prevent COVID from progressing to ARDS by&#xD;
      avoiding secondary bacterial infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A comparative study involving 44 cases, suggested that adding oral Trimethoprim or&#xD;
      Cotrimoxazole reduces acute lung injury in patients with severe COVID-19, resulting in&#xD;
      decreased need for ventilatory support and improved outcomes. These drugs have no direct&#xD;
      antiviral properties, but they may help to prevent ARDS. The positive effects were noticeable&#xD;
      within hours of the first dose, owing to their high absorption and lung penetration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Another study involving 201 patients shown a significant reduction in mortality, intubation&#xD;
      rate, length of hospital and critical care stay and inflammatory markers in the patients&#xD;
      treated with Cotrimoxazole along with standard treatment compared to the patients treated&#xD;
      with standard treatment alone. A higher dose of Cotrimoxazole was used in this study with&#xD;
      excellent safety profile.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A randomized control trial with Cotrimoxazole in patients with severe COVID-19 is underway in&#xD;
      India and results are awaited (Clinical Trials Registration-India ID CTRI/2020/10/028297).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Another randomized control trial is currently underway led by the author and team where a&#xD;
      lower dose of Cotrimoxazole is being used (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier NCT04470531).20 High&#xD;
      dose Co-trimoxazole may have a potential role to play in preventing the exaggerated immune&#xD;
      response in the form of cytokine storm syndrome in patients with severe COVID-19 by its&#xD;
      anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory effect.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RATIONALE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Corona virus disease (COVID-19), caused by SARS-COV2, is a highly transmissible and&#xD;
      potentially deadly disease that is currently causing widespread concern in the global public&#xD;
      health community. Bangladesh's pandemic situation is also rapidly changing, with positive&#xD;
      cases and deaths rising by the day. There is no specific management for this highly lethal&#xD;
      viral infection as of yet. However, there are a few medications that may have a positive&#xD;
      impact on the patient's recovery. But large randomized controlled trials investigating the&#xD;
      efficacy of those agents have not found much promising result specially when it comes to&#xD;
      mortality benefit and cost effectiveness. We are still in need of better therapeutics to&#xD;
      combat this pandemic situation. Co-trimoxazole is a tried-and-true antibiotic that has been&#xD;
      used in clinical practice for over 60 years and is effective against a wide range of&#xD;
      bacteria. Co-trimoxazole also has anti-inflammatory, and immunomodulatory properties in&#xD;
      addition to its antimicrobial properties. In previous studies Co-trimoxazole has shown to&#xD;
      exert anti-cytokine effect by inhibiting interleukin 1, 6 (IL-1, IL-6) and Tumour Necrosis&#xD;
      Factor α (TNF α). These are the major cytokines identified in patients with severe COVID-19.&#xD;
      Because Cotrimoxazole has been shown to improve clinical outcomes in ARDS patients in some&#xD;
      case reports, there is a chance that it may help improve clinical outcomes in COVID-19&#xD;
      patients. The efficacy of a variety of old and new therapeutic agents is being studied all&#xD;
      over the world in order to effectively prevent the life-threatening conditions linked to&#xD;
      COVID-19. Because of its immunomodulatory effect, low cost, and good safety profile,&#xD;
      co-trimoxazole may be an ideal candidate to investigate. If this agent can be found to reduce&#xD;
      the oxygen demand or shorten the length of stay in hospital of severe Covid-19 patients it&#xD;
      will definitely have a positive impact in the era of pandemic in resource constraint setting&#xD;
      like Bangladesh. This research will provide new data on the safety and effectiveness of&#xD;
      high-dose Co-trimoxazole, which will hopefully aid in developing an effective treatment&#xD;
      protocol for COVID-19 infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Question:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Is there any beneficial role of high dose co-trimoxazole in patients with severe COVID-19?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      General Objectives To compare the role of high dose co-trimoxazole in severeCOVID-19 patients&#xD;
      in addition to standard treatment versus standard treatment along with placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To compare the baseline characteristics in severe covid 19 patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To compare the length of stay who are treated with high dose co-trimoxazole in addition to&#xD;
      standard treatment versus standard treatment along with placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To compare the requirement for oxygen support through high flow nasal cannula who are treated&#xD;
      with high dose co-trimoxazole in addition to standard treatment versus standard treatment&#xD;
      along with placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To compare the requirement for ventilatory support (non-invasive and invasive ventilation)&#xD;
      who are treated with high dose co-trimoxazole in addition to standard treatment versus&#xD;
      standard treatment along with placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To assess the mortality in patients with severe COVID-19 who are treated with high dose&#xD;
      co-trimoxazole in addition to standard treatment versus standard treatment along with&#xD;
      placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To assess the changes in the physiological and biochemical parameters who are treated with&#xD;
      co-trimoxazole in addition to standard treatment versus standard treatment along with&#xD;
      placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To find out side effects of drugs who are treated with high dose co-trimoxazole in addition&#xD;
      to standard treatment versus standard treatment along with placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods and procedure:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design: Single-centre interventional double-blind placebo controlled randomized trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study duration: Six months. Place of study: Medicine department (Covid Unit) of Bangabandhu&#xD;
      Sheikh Mujib Medical University (BSMMU) Period of Study: Six months following approval of the&#xD;
      protocol Sampling technique: Random sampling followed by patients will be assigned in a 1:1&#xD;
      ratio to either oral high dose co-trimoxazole in addition to standard therapy or standard&#xD;
      therapy along with placebo&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample Size:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to provide reasonable estimates for the power calculation in the current trial, we&#xD;
      used data from a recent COVID-19 study that showed decrease in length of stay by about&#xD;
      25%.Based on similar change with the current intervention we estimated that a total of 94&#xD;
      participants would be needed to detect a significant difference with over 90% power. We will&#xD;
      conduct an interim power analysis to test these assumptions, using data from 50 individuals,&#xD;
      and adjust sample size if power is lower than anticipated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At least total 94 study population will be included for the study.&#xD;
