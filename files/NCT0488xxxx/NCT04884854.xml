    <textblock>
      Sepsis is a global healthcare burden sepsis, it reaches 20-30 million cases annually (WHO&#xD;
      data). Numerous studies have shown that extracorporeal hemoperfusion therapies that eliminate&#xD;
      endotoxin and\or excess of cytokines improve treatment outcomes in patients with septic&#xD;
      shock. Aim of the study: to evaluate safety and feasibility of clinical use of an&#xD;
      extracorporeal blood adsorber based on a hypercrosslinked styrene-divinylbenzene copolymer&#xD;
      with immobilized lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-selective ligand designed to remove endotoxins from&#xD;
      the bloodstream to treat patients with septic shock.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Introduction. Sepsis, according to the latest consensus deﬁnition (SEPSIS-3, 2016), is a&#xD;
      disease characterized by life-threatening organ failure resulting from a disordered&#xD;
      regulation of the body's response to infection. Sepsis continues to be the leading cause of&#xD;
      death in intensive care units in almost any country in the world.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The highest mortality rate in sepsis is associated with the development of septic shock (SS).&#xD;
      Septic shock is deﬁned as sepsis (according to the criteria of SEPSIS-3, 2016) accompanied by&#xD;
      severe hemodynamic, cellular and metabolic disorders, with a higher risk of fatal outcome&#xD;
      than sepsis without shock. On average, SS is detected with a frequency of 8.3-10.4% among ICU&#xD;
      patients, and its mortality, according to recent estimates, reaches 38-50% and even higher,&#xD;
      exceeding 50-80% with such comorbidity as diabetes mellitus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Success in treating septic shock is traditionally associated with adequate vasopressor,&#xD;
      antibacterial, and anti-shock therapy, including inotropic support. At the same time, such&#xD;
      factors as multiple antibiotic resistance of Gram-negative bacteria, changes in the&#xD;
      intestinal microbiota and associated proﬁle of bacterial metabolites entering circulation and&#xD;
      participating in the pathogenesis of sepsis, other bacterial products such as&#xD;
      pathogen-associated molecular patterns and cytokines induced by them, bacterial endotoxins&#xD;
      contributing most to the multiorgan failure, nowadays are considered as new targets for&#xD;
      developing eﬀective mtools of controlling the septic shock sequelae.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Taking into account the key role of bacterial endotoxins in the pathogenesis of septic shock&#xD;
      and the absence of a signiﬁcant trend for reducing mortality in response to the medication&#xD;
      treatment, increasing interest is being focused on extracorporeal methods of clearing the&#xD;
      endotoxins and inﬂammatory immune mediators from the bloodstream. Such methods are designed&#xD;
      to reduce the levels of pathogenetically signiﬁcant molecules in the systemic circulation&#xD;
      down to less critical values at least for a certain period of time in order to enable the&#xD;
      immune system and antibiotics to reduce the bacterial load and the production of new&#xD;
      endotoxin molecules.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The methods used and developed with respect to selective adsorption of endotoxin molecules&#xD;
      from the bloodstream are promising. They provide, at early stages of the disease,&#xD;
      interruption of the pro-inﬂammatory cascade initiated by inborn immune cells and causing&#xD;
      organ dysfunction. At the same time, the place of LPS-selective hemoperfusion in sepsis&#xD;
      therapy is still not clearly deﬁned.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently, the ﬁrst clinical experience of using a new generation of Eﬀeron LPS medical device&#xD;
      for successful treatment of a patient with sepsis has been reported [Ushakova N.D., Tikhonova&#xD;
      S.N., Rozenko D.A. Hemosorption by a Column Adsorber Based on Hyper-Cross-Linked&#xD;
      Styrene-Divinylbenzene Copolymer with Immobilized Lipopolysaccharide-Selective Ligand in&#xD;
      Combined Intensive Care of Lung Cancer-Related Postoperative Acute Lung Injury (Case Report).&#xD;
      Obshchaya Reanimatologiya=General Reanimatology. 2020; 16 (4): 14-20. [In Russ.] DOI:&#xD;
      10.15360/1813-9779-2020-4-14-20].&#xD;
&#xD;
      This extracorporeal adsorber contains a multimodal sorbent based on a hypercrosslinked&#xD;
      styrene-divinylbenzene copolymer with a covalently immobilized ligand to the Lipid A domain&#xD;
      of LPS molecule. The combination of a porous matrix containing mesopores and ligand provides&#xD;
      selective and simultaneous action of the adsorbent on two types of dissimilar therapeutic&#xD;
      targets (cytokines and endotoxins, respectively).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Efferon LPS (Efferon JSC, Moscow, Russia) is a single-use therapeutic device for&#xD;
      extracorporeal blood purification using direct hemoperfusion. Detoxification is carried out&#xD;
      by selective adsorption of lipopolysaccharides (bacterial endotoxins) and non-selective&#xD;
      removal of cytokines by internal porous structure. It is a cylindrical polycarbonate casing&#xD;
      filled with spherical granules of LPS-selective polymeric adsorbent mesoporous beads and&#xD;
      isotonic sodium chloride solution. The device is registered in Russia as a medical device RZN&#xD;
      2019/8886.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the study was to evaluate the safety and clinical eligibility of a novel medical&#xD;
      device based on a hypercrosslinked styrene divinylbenzene copolymer with an immobilized&#xD;
      LPS-selective ligand designed to remove endotoxins from the bloodstream for treatment of&#xD;
      patients with septic shock.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Materials and methods. Nine patients (mean age 58 years, 5 men and 4 women, initial median&#xD;
      APACHE II score 28 points, SOFA score 10 points) with confirmed gram-negative bacterial&#xD;
      infection and septic shock (SEPSIS-3, 2016) underwent LPS-selective hemoperfusion using&#xD;
      Efferon LPS for 6 hours, followed by prolonged venous-venous hemodiafiltration. The decision&#xD;
      to use LPS-selective hemoperfusion in a particular patient was made by the attending doctor&#xD;
      with the participation of a medical consultant team in accordance with clinical indications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before hemoperfusion (day 0), immediately after it, one day after its end (day 1) and once a&#xD;
      day for the next 4 days, patients were determined hemodynamic parameters, oxygenation, signs&#xD;
      of organ failure, leukocyte count, procalcitonin levels, C- reactive protein, IL 1β, clinical&#xD;
      chemistry parameters. All patients underwent a test for endotoxin activity at the same time.&#xD;
      Endotoxin Activity Assay Kit (EAA TM) (Spectral Medical Inc., Canada; Certiﬁcate No. FSZ&#xD;
      2009/04982) was used to determine endotoxin activity (EAA) using chemiluminescent rapid test&#xD;
      and immunodiagnostic reagent set according to the manufacturer's protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SOFA and APACHE II scales were used for comprehensive assessment of clinical status and risk&#xD;
      of adverse outcomes. In the course of treatment, adverse reactions during the procedures and&#xD;
      final outcome of the hospital stay (duration of stay in ICU and other departments, 28-day&#xD;
      mortality) were assessed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hemoperfusion through the Eﬀeron LPS adsorber was performed in hospitalized patients with&#xD;
      unstable hemodynamic parameters, obvious signs of septic shock according to SEPSIS-3 (2016),&#xD;
      during the ﬁrst hours after making the diagnosis of septic shock. The procedures were&#xD;
      performed on MultiFiltrate (Fresenius) along the veno-venous bypass. After LPS-selective&#xD;
      hemoperfusion procedure, continuous veno-venous hemodiaﬁltration (CVVHDF) was performed on&#xD;
      MultiFiltrate (Fresenius).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis. Statistical analysis of research data was carried out using descriptive&#xD;
      statistics. The test for normal distribution of paired variable changes before and after&#xD;
      hemosorption was performed for each data group using the Shapiro-Wilk test, the hypothesis of&#xD;
      normal distribution was rejected at P&lt;0.05. To assess the statistical signiﬁcance of&#xD;
      diﬀerences between groups, in distribution diﬀering from the normal, the bilateral Wilcoxon&#xD;
      test for paired samples or Mann-Witney test for independent groups were used. In normal&#xD;
      distribution of paired variable changes in groups, the signiﬁcance of differences was&#xD;
      assessed using the Student's paired bilateral t-criterion. The value of P&lt;0.05 was taken as&#xD;
      the cutoﬀ value for statistical signiﬁcance. When comparing groups by categories of treatment&#xD;
      outcome &quot;survived-dead&quot; in the group of patients undergoing hemosorption and the group of&#xD;
      patients with abdominal sepsis who did not get hemosorbents (control sample), the exact&#xD;
      Fisher's test and the calculation of sample power adequacy at alpha=0.05 were used (SigmaPlot&#xD;
      12.5, Systat Software,USA). The Fisher test was also used to compare the percentage of&#xD;
      abdominal sepsis and the sex distribution between the above-mentioned groups of patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The ultimate goal of the study was to improve treatment outcomes in patients with septic&#xD;
      shock and acute renal failure through combined use of LPS-selective hemoperfusion and&#xD;
      prolonged venovenous hemodiaﬁltration.&#xD;
