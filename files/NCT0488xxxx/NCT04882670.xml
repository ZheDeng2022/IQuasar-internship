  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Fragility fracture is easily associated with a clinical worsening of patients in terms of&#xD;
      quality of life and disability in the medium and long term. Following this traumatic event,&#xD;
      more than half of the patients are unable to recover pre-fracture motor skills such as the&#xD;
      ability to walk. The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on this type of patient has not been&#xD;
      described and it is easy to hypothesize that, given their intrinsic frailty condition, they&#xD;
      may have been significantly affected by changes in care pathways.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The global health emergency due to the spread of COVID-19 has caused unprecedented pressure&#xD;
      on the health systems of the various countries involved. COVID-19 has had a direct impact on&#xD;
      the health status of people with an extremely high number of ICU admissions and deaths, but&#xD;
      it has also led to a series of equally strong indirect consequences as described in various&#xD;
      fields by multiple authors. In order to cope with the great health demand linked to the&#xD;
      epidemic, hospitals had to invest human and physical resources, subtracting them from other&#xD;
      care activities: operating theaters, surgical and non-surgical departments and the related&#xD;
      staff normally destined for patient care were redirected and relocated to the care of COVID&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the field of orthopedic surgery in the first phase of the spread of the epidemic, all&#xD;
      non-essential interventions have been postponed and for essential interventions specific&#xD;
      paths have been created at hospitals capable of operating even during the pandemic. This&#xD;
      organization has led to a reduction in the overall number of hospitalized patients but the&#xD;
      number of old patients operated for hip fracture has not decreased. From the point of view of&#xD;
      the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on all patients operated for hip fracture with respect to&#xD;
      the care outcomes during the postoperative hospital stay, the available data are lacking.&#xD;
