  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We propose to conduct a randomized 6-day isocaloric crossover feeding study in humans with&#xD;
      prediabetes and obesity. We will study the effect of restricting the timing of caloric intake&#xD;
      to earlier in the day (TRF) versus later in the day (usual feeding pattern, UFP) on glycemia&#xD;
      and inflammation in an inpatient setting.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Time Restricted Feeding (TRF) is a variant of intermittent fasting that confines caloric&#xD;
      intake to active daytime hours and involves fasting for 12 to 14 hours. Circadian&#xD;
      misalignment caused by changes in sleeping and eating behaviors has emerged as having a&#xD;
      detrimental impact on weight, glucose homeostasis and other cardiovascular disease-related&#xD;
      outcomes. Feeding during active periods appears to be advantageous for weight, glucose&#xD;
      metabolism and lipid profiles whereas feeding during the inactive period confers deleterious&#xD;
      effects on these outcomes. Therefore, TRF shows great promise as a novel intervention for&#xD;
      addressing obesity and related cardiovascular outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Animal studies suggest that timing of feeding, including intermittent fasting or TRF,&#xD;
      decreases inflammation and causes ketosis. Human studies that examined time restricted&#xD;
      feeding for improvement in glycemia in as little as 4 days did not observe changes in&#xD;
      clinical markers of inflammarion such as hsCRP. Moreover, systemic and adipose tissue&#xD;
      inflammation as it occurs in obesity shows dynamic changes in the context of weight loss that&#xD;
      would not be clearly apparent in a weight stable state. A potential mechanistic link between&#xD;
      glycemic improvement and systemic inflammation would be the Receptor for Advanced Glycation&#xD;
      End-Products (RAGE) and its soluble form (sRAGE).This form of inflammation has not been&#xD;
      measured in reported eTRF studies and its relationship with eTRFwould bea significant&#xD;
      contribution from the proposed study.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>10 obese, pre-diabetic participants will be randomly assigned to usual eating pattern vs timed restricted eating over 5 days as inpatient in a metabolic unit. They will undergo baseline and post-intervention measurements of glucose tolerance, body compostion by Bod Pod, continuous glucose monitoring by Free-Syle Libre monitor and donate blood for markers of inflammation. They will consume their usual pre-study diet. After completing Arm I, they will cross-over to Arm 2.</intervention_model_description>

    <masking_description>Investigator and participants will be blinded to randomization prior to initiation of study arm. The randomization will be determined by the research pharmacist. Since the arms require different timing of meals it will be obvious as to the arm, once it is started. However, neither the investigator nor the participant can choose the order of the arms.</masking_description>
