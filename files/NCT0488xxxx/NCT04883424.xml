      This study, designed according to the randomized pre-test and post-test control group&#xD;
      experimental model, will be carried out with the patients who apply to the Diabetes Education&#xD;
      Unit of Samsun Training and Research Hospital The universe of the study will consist of adult&#xD;
      patients between the ages of 20-65 among the diabetic patients who apply to Samsun Training&#xD;
      and Research Hospital Diabetes Education Unit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sample of the study will consist of 100 diabetic patients who comply with the selection&#xD;
      criteria and volunteer to participate in the study. The average scores of Hensarling's&#xD;
      Diabetes Family Support Scale in Diabetes Patients were determined as 64.12, with an error&#xD;
      margin of %5% and a 95% confidence interval, with a sample size of 80% with a sample size of&#xD;
      35 patients for each group, a total of 70 patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Considering the participant losses during the project, 50 diabetic patients (experiment = 50,&#xD;
      control = 50) for each group were determined as a total sample group of 100 diabetic patients&#xD;
      with 50% reserve. Personal questionnaire prepared by the researcher in line with the&#xD;
      literature, Health Belief Model Scale in Diabetes Patients, Hensarling's Diabetes Family&#xD;
      Support Scale and Diabetes Attitude Scale will be used. The purpose of the study will be&#xD;
      explained to the diabetic patients who apply to Samsun Training and Research Hospital&#xD;
      Diabetes Education Unit and the study will be carried out with diabetic patients who agree to&#xD;
      participate in the study. Diabetes patients will be divided into experimental and control&#xD;
      groups by Simple Random Method. A training program will be applied to the diabetic patient&#xD;
      and their family members included in the experimental group. After the training, a reminder&#xD;
      text message will be sent to their phones twice a week for three months and they will be&#xD;
      called once a month. Three months after the end of the training, the control will be called&#xD;
      for examination.&#xD;

      This study focuses on the effect of family support on diabetes management by using the Health&#xD;
      Belief Model. This work; The health belief model, which is a human behavioral model, will&#xD;
      comprehensively examine the effects of the planned diabetes education to be given to the&#xD;
      diabetic patient together with the family member on the diabetes management of the diabetic&#xD;
      patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design and environment The study is an experimental study with randomized controlled&#xD;
      pre-test and post-test control group. The randomized clinical trial is based on guidelines&#xD;
      recommended by Consolidated Standard of Reporting Trials - CONSORT 2010. The data of the&#xD;
      study will be collected in the Diabetes Education Unit of Samsun Training and Research&#xD;
      Hospital between January and June 2021.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As a pre-test for diabetic patients who applied to Samsun Training and Research Hospital&#xD;
      Diabetes Education Unit and accepted to participate in the study; The questionnaire form&#xD;
      prepared by the researcher in accordance with the literature, the Health Belief Model Scale&#xD;
      in Diabetes Patients and Hensarling's Diabetes Family Support Scale will be applied. After&#xD;
      the pretest application, they will be randomly assigned to the sample pool to be divided into&#xD;
      experimental and control groups. Diabetes patients will be divided into experimental and&#xD;
      control groups by simple random method. A questionnaire form prepared by the researcher in&#xD;
      accordance with the literature and the Diabetes Attitude Scale will be applied to the family&#xD;
      members of the diabetes patients in the experimental group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Collection Tools Personal Information Form (for diabetic patients): This form, developed&#xD;
      by researchers in accordance with the literature, is used by diabetic patients; It includes&#xD;
      information about the disease such as age, gender, marital status, educational status,&#xD;
      occupation, income status, duration of diabetes, history of other chronic diseases, diabetes&#xD;
      treatment, alcohol-smoking, physical activity, nutrition, diabetes control interval.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Personal Information Form (for family member): This form, developed by researchers in&#xD;
      accordance with the literature, consists of introductory features of the family member&#xD;
      including gender, age, marital status, educational status, occupation, income, employment&#xD;
      status, and relationship with a diabetic patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Health Belief Model Scale in Diabetes Patients: This scale; It is the form of &quot;Health Belief&#xD;
      Model Scale in Diabetes&quot; adapted to Type 2 diabetes patients by Tan in 2004 and adapted to&#xD;
      Turkish in 2007 by Kartal and Özsoy. There are 5 sub-dimensions of the model in the scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the evaluation of the scale, Likert type scoring with scale items ranging from 1 to 5;&#xD;
      &quot;Strongly disagree&quot; (1), &quot;disagree&quot; (2), &quot;undecided&quot; (3), &quot;agree&quot; (4), &quot;strongly agree&quot; (5).&#xD;
      The scale consists of 33 items and five main sub-dimensions: Perceived sensitivity (4 items),&#xD;
      Perceived severity (3 items), Perceived usefulness (7 items), Perceived barriers (9 items),&#xD;
      and recommended health-related activities (10 items). A minimum of 33 and a maximum of 165&#xD;
      points can be obtained from the whole scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hensarling's Diabetes Family Support Scale: The scale was developed by Hensarling in 2009 as&#xD;
      a valid and reliable test that measures the perceived family support of adults with Type 2&#xD;
      diabetes. Turkish validity and reliability were established in 2011 by Akin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As a result of the analysis, it determined 4 sub-dimensions of &quot;Diabetes Family Support&quot;:&#xD;
      empathic support (9 items), encouragement (7 items), facilitative support (6 items), and&#xD;
      sharing support (2 items).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each question with a scale consisting of a total of 24 questions is evaluated over 5 options.&#xD;
      These options are &quot;Never&quot;, &quot;Almost Never&quot;, &quot;Sometimes&quot;, &quot;Most of the time&quot;, &quot;Always&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The lowest possible score for Hensarling's Diabetes Family Support Scale is zero (0), and the&#xD;
      highest possible total score is ninetysix (96). The fact that the total score obtained from&#xD;
      the scale is close to 96 points indicates high family support. The fact that the score&#xD;
      obtained from the scale is close to 0 points indicates that family support is perceived less.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Diabetes Attitude Scale (DAS): The Diabetes Attitude Scale, which was developed by the United&#xD;
      States National Diabetes Commission and whose validity and reliability study was conducted in&#xD;
      1999 by Özcan, will be used to determine the attitudes of the individuals participating in&#xD;
      the study. Seven subgroups covered by the DAS; special education need, attitude towards&#xD;
      patient compliance, severity of type 2 diabetes, blood glucose control and complications, the&#xD;
      effect of diabetes on the patient's life, attitude towards patient autonomy and attitude&#xD;
      towards team care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The number of items in the subgroups ranges from 3 to 7. Scale items were scored with Likert&#xD;
      type scoring ranging from 1 to 5. If the score is&gt; 3, it indicates positive attitude, if the&#xD;
      score is 3, it indicates negative attitude. The increase of the score towards 5 or the&#xD;
      decrease towards 1 strengthens the attitude in that direction. By adding up all the item&#xD;
      scores of each subgroup of the scale and dividing it by the number of subgroup items, the&#xD;
      attitude score of that individual belonging to the subgroup, ranging from 1 to 5, is&#xD;
      calculated. Likewise, the diabetes attitude score is calculated in general by adding the&#xD;
      scores of all items in the scale and dividing them by 34. The interpretation of the scale&#xD;
      total score is similar to the interpretation of item scores. If the scale score is&gt; 3, it&#xD;
      indicates positive attitude, if the scale score is 3, it indicates a negative attitude, and&#xD;
      the increase or decrease in the score strengthens the attitude in that direction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Metabolic Results Control Form: This form was developed by the researchers in line with the&#xD;
      literature. Before the pre-tests, the fasting blood glucose (FBG), Hemoglobin A1C (HbA1C),&#xD;
      body mass index (BMI), blood pressure measurement, waist circumference measurement,&#xD;
      triglyceride, HDL (high density lipoprotein), LDL (low density lipoprotein) lipoprotein) and&#xD;
      total cholesterol values will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Behavior Evaluation Form: This form was developed by researchers in line with the literature.&#xD;
      In the pre-test, it is a 11-question form that includes the practices of diabetic patients in&#xD;
      the experimental and control groups for diabetes management such as physical activity,&#xD;
      nutritional habits, blood glucose monitoring and foot care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As a result of the research, the data obtained from the personal information form, health&#xD;
      belief model scale in diabetes patients, Hensarling's diabetes family support scale, behavior&#xD;
      evaluation form and metabolic results form will be evaluated and reported in the SPSS package&#xD;
      program. Descriptive statistics, paired t test, correlation analysis will be used to evaluate&#xD;
      the data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethical issues: Study approval was given by the Ondokuz Mayıs University Clinical Research&#xD;
      Ethics Committee. (Decision No: B.30.2.ODM.0.20.08 / 262-320). All participants were informed&#xD;
      about this study and written informed consent was obtained.&#xD;
