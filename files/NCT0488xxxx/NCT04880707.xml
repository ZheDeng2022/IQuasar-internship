  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Each year, over 3.5 million, mostly, healthy young adults, have their third molar teeth&#xD;
      ('wisdom teeth') removed under sedation and are often given opioid prescriptions for managing&#xD;
      their pain. Wisdom molar removal is one of the most common reasons for opioid prescriptions&#xD;
      to be given to adolescents. There is a national thrust to reduce both the dose and the&#xD;
      duration of such opioid prescriptions because even short-term opioid exposures increase risk&#xD;
      for narcotic addiction and misuse. Non-opioid options to manage pain will still allow for&#xD;
      sufficient pain control without risking addiction, and hence, a fundamental component of our&#xD;
      response to combat the current national opioid crisis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators are going to study a promising option- the Twin Block dental anesthetic&#xD;
      injection. The Twin block involves injecting the standard dental numbing medication in a way&#xD;
      that 'numbs' the 'jaw-clencher' muscles on the side of the face. The investigators found that&#xD;
      the Twin block relieved jaw pain stemming from these muscles, in a quick and sustained&#xD;
      manner, even in patients whose pain following wisdom tooth removal primarily came from 'taut'&#xD;
      and tender jaw-clencher muscles. However, what is not known is- how often do patients who&#xD;
      have their wisdom teeth removed under sedation, end up in significant pain from taut and&#xD;
      tender jaw-clencher muscles? Will using the twin block effectively reduce pain in such&#xD;
      patients? In this pilot study, the investigators will examine wisdom molar extraction&#xD;
      patients one day after their procedure. Those with significant pain (pain rated â‰¥ 5 on a 0-10&#xD;
      scale) in their jaw-clencher muscles, will get either the Twin block injection or a placebo.&#xD;
      The investigators will track both 1) pain before and after the injection, and 2) pain&#xD;
      medication usage over a 7-day period to see if both pain and opioid dosage come down with the&#xD;
      Twin block. This study can support a simple, safe and inexpensive means to reduce pain after&#xD;
      a common procedure.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Annually, over 3.5 million predominantly young and healthy individuals undergo outpatient&#xD;
      third molar tooth extractions and routinely receive postoperative opioid prescription (Moore,&#xD;
      Nahouraii et al. 2006). This procedure is among the most prevalent instances of opioid&#xD;
      prescriptions to adolescents and is the subject of a national debate, given the CDC's mandate&#xD;
      for minimizing the number and duration of opioid prescriptions (Volkow, McLellan et al. 2011,&#xD;
      Dowell, Haegerich et al. 2016, Moore, Dionne et al. 2016). Targeting such a prevalent&#xD;
      practice by supplementing postoperative analgesia with non-opioid options as well as&#xD;
      optimizing and tracking opioid usage will significantly reduce prescription opioid&#xD;
      use/misuse. The Twin Block is a local anesthetic nerve block that eases muscle pain emanating&#xD;
      from the jaw muscles and has been anecdotally shown to be effective in relieving&#xD;
      post-operative pain in patients who developed muscle pain following third molar extractions.&#xD;
      However, the incidence of acute muscle pain following third molar extractions is not well&#xD;
      established. Accordingly, the aims of this study are two-fold:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A. Objectives This study has 2 objectives: 1) To estimate the incidence of acute muscle pain&#xD;
      involving the temporalis and masseter muscles (the jaw closer muscles that are commonly&#xD;
      implicated in resulting in jaw muscle pain), following third molar extractions and 2) Conduct&#xD;
      a double-blind prospective study to compare the efficacy of Twin Block in relieving&#xD;
      postextraction pain in those patients determined to experience muscle pain following the&#xD;
      procedure B. Hypotheses / Research Question(s) Hypothesis 1: The incidence of post-third&#xD;
      molar extraction muscle pain is at least 40% Hypothesis 2: Twin block reduces post-extraction&#xD;
      muscle pain by 50% 1.2 Research Significance The twin block is a simple and effective local&#xD;
      anesthetic nerve block for 'numbing' the innervation to the masseter and temporalis muscles,&#xD;
      two key jaw clencher muscles, with emerging data corroborating efficacy in the diagnosis and&#xD;
      management of both acute and chronic myogenous orofacial pain (Quek, Young et al. 2014,&#xD;
      Ananthan et al. 2017). 1.3 Research Design and Methods The study is designed as a prospective&#xD;
      evaluation of patients undergoing third molar extractions under intravenous sedation to&#xD;
      identify those developing post-extraction muscle pain on the day following the procedure.&#xD;
      Subsequently, such patients will be prospectively randomized to receive the Twin block to&#xD;
      deliver either the dental local anesthetic or saline as a placebo. Post-injection muscle pain&#xD;
      will be evaluated 15 minutes following the administration of the injection. All patients will&#xD;
      be provided similar directions and prescriptions for pain management. All patients will be&#xD;
      contacted to document/report their daily pain medications and queried one week after the&#xD;
      extraction/s for their overall pain experience and any adverse effects from the injection.&#xD;
