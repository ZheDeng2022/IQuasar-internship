  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Overweight and obesity are today considered among the most important health risks facing&#xD;
      humanity with more than one in two adults overweight or obese in western countries. In&#xD;
      addition, Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a common comorbidity associated with overweight&#xD;
      and obesity and counts for 5% of the French population under 65 years of age and 15% in&#xD;
      people over 65 years old. Despite the accumulation of scientific evidence supporting the&#xD;
      benefits of physical activity, obese and diabetic people remain insufficiently active and&#xD;
      current programs struggle to engage and sustain physical activity of patients over long&#xD;
      periods of time. It is therefore urgent to develop interventions that can effectively change&#xD;
      individuals' behavior. In this context, &quot;e-health&quot; interventions and gamification appear to&#xD;
      be a particularly promising avenue to improve physical activity and reduce attrition rates of&#xD;
      current programs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This clinical trial aim to test the effectiveness of a digital intervention based on&#xD;
      gamification and teamwork in comparison to a supervised physical activity program. The&#xD;
      investigators hypothesized that the intervention will be efficient by the development of a&#xD;
      self-determined motivation through the process of gamification on the one hand. On the other&#xD;
      hand, through the in-group collaboration with other people who share the same stigmatized&#xD;
      criteria that will help participants to overcome weight stigmas, acting generally as physical&#xD;
      activity barriers.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This trial is a randomized, two-arm intervention design that will examine the efficacy of a&#xD;
      digital group-based intervention based on gamification and teamwork among obese and T2DM&#xD;
      patients. The experimental arm will be compared to an active control group representing the&#xD;
      traditional care program (supervised physical activity).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The digital intervention is composed of four components within a smartphone application: a) a&#xD;
      gamification of PA, b) a remote adapted physical activity program with telecoaching sessions,&#xD;
      c) an interface for exchange and conversation and, d) an activity monitoring tool.&#xD;
      Accelerometer data, self-reported PA, body composition, and physical capacities will be&#xD;
      assessed before, at the end of the intervention and then at the issue of a 6-month follow up.&#xD;
      To advance our understanding of complex interventions like gamified and group-based ones,&#xD;
      this study will explore several psychological mediators relative to motivation, enjoyment,&#xD;
      in-group identification, or perceived weight stigma. Finally, to assess a potential superior&#xD;
      efficiency compared to the current treatment (face-to-face supervised PA), this study will&#xD;
      include a cost-utility analysis between the two conditions.&#xD;
