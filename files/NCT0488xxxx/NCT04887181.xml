    <textblock>
      The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of a self etch adhesive resin and two&#xD;
      desensitizing agents(Calcium phosphate, 5% glutaraldehyde) in treatment of dentin&#xD;
      hypersensitivity on the quality of life of individuals.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This in-vivo study was done among 69 participants who reported at least one sensitivite&#xD;
      tooth(Schiff Sensitivity Score &gt;1) as a result of the clinical examination. Participants were&#xD;
      randomly divided into three treatment groups(n=23):&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Tetracalcium phosphate and dicalcium phosphate containing desensitizer (Teethmate&#xD;
      Desensitizer) II. %35 hydroxyethyl methacrylate and %5 glutaraldehyde containing desensitizer&#xD;
      (Gluma Desensitizer) III. Self-etch adhesive resin (Hybrid Bond) These materials used in&#xD;
      treatment of dentin hypersensitivity in 6 months clinical follow-up and the effects on the&#xD;
      quality of life of individuals were evaluated with Dentine Hypersensitivity Experience&#xD;
      Questionnaire (DHEQ).&#xD;

    <measure>Schiff Cold Air Sensitivity Scale Scores</measure>
    <time_frame>Before treatment, immediately after treatment, 1 week, 1 month, 3 month and 6 month</time_frame>
    <description>Average scores based on Schiff cold air sensitivity scale after evaporative air application. The Schiff score ranges from 0 to 3. Minimum value is 0, maximum value is 3. An increase in the score from 0 to 3 indicates an increase in sensitivity.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Visual Analog Scale(VAS) Scores</measure>
    <time_frame>Before treatment, immediately after treatment, 1 week, 1 month, 3 month and 6 month</time_frame>
    <description>Average scores based on Visual Analog Scale(VAS) after applying evaporative air. The VAS score ranges from 0 to 10. The minimum value is 0 and the maximum value is 10. A score of 0 is defined as &quot;no pain&quot; while a score of 10 is defined as &quot;intolerable pain&quot;.</description>

    <time_frame>Change from baseline quality of life at 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Data obtained after individuals complete the Dentin Hypersensitivity Experience Questionnaire. The decrease in the measured scores over time indicates that the quality of life has improved.</description>
