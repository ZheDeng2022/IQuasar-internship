  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Embody has developed a retinol gummy with the aim to improve the appearance of early signs of&#xD;
      aging, such as fine lines, dark spots, and sagging. Embody's retinol gummy has also the goal&#xD;
      to reduce the overall frequency of adult acne and an improvement of overall skin health by&#xD;
      promoting hydrated, brightened skin. The study aims to collect self-reported outcomes and&#xD;
      photographic images to understand the assessment of the efficacy of treatment from the&#xD;
      participant's perspective, and if participants see an improvement in their fine lines,&#xD;
      wrinkles, dark spots, and sagging.&#xD;
