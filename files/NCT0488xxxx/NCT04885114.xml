  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is the first clinical study of VY-HTT01, a gene therapy for early-stage Huntington's&#xD;
      Disease (HD) patients. The primary goal of this trial is to evaluate the safety and&#xD;
      tolerability of VY-HTT01. This study is a first in human study, Phase 1b, open-label,&#xD;
      randomized, multicenter, dose escalation study with a delayed treatment control arm.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This dose escalation trial will evaluate the safety and tolerability of 4 single dose levels&#xD;
      of VY-HTT01. The maximum duration that a subject randomized to treatment may be involved in&#xD;
      the study is up to 15 months. Delayed treatment subjects will be followed for a minimum of 6&#xD;
      months as a control before moving up into the treatment arm in the next cohort. The maximum&#xD;
      duration that a delayed treatment subject may be involved in the study is up to 24 months.&#xD;
      Subjects who participate in this study will be asked to enroll in a long-term observation&#xD;
      study.&#xD;

    We have discontinued our 1st generation HD program with the VYTAL Study &amp; have initiated a 2nd&#xD;
    generation program using a novel, proprietary AAV capsid that may enable intravenous&#xD;

    <measure>Huntington's Disease Cognitive Assessment Battery (HD-CAB) Measure</measure>
    <time_frame>Collected for duration of study, average of 1 year after treatment</time_frame>
    <description>HD-CAB measure will assess changes from baseline in the HD-CAB score for cognitive dysfunction in early manifest HD patients. HD-CAB consists of 6 tests; (1) Symbol Digit Modality Test (SDMT), (2) Paced Tapping, (3) One Touch Stockings of Cambridge, (4) Emotional Recognition, (5) Trial Making B and (6) Hopkins Learning Test. A multi-component score is derived by transforming the subject's score on each cognitive test to a z-score. The six z-scores are averaged to produce the HD-CAB score. A positive change from baseline indicates improvement in cognitive function; a negative change indicates worsening in cognitive function.</description>
