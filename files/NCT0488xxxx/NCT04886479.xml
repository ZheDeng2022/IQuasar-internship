    <textblock>
      The primary objectives of this study is to to compare baseline data between 3 groups -&#xD;
      habitual wearers of DDSH (Daily Disposable Silicone Hydrogel) contact lenses / habitual&#xD;
      wearers of DDH (Daily Disposable Hydrogel) contact lenses / non-lens wearers for&#xD;
      physiological responses and to compare the physiological responses post closed eye lens wear&#xD;
      in 2 groups - habitual wearers of DDSH /habitual wearers of DDH after 3 hours.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Is between 17 and 60 years of age inclusive (age matching required between all 3 study&#xD;
             groups), and has full legal capacity to volunteer;&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Has had a self-reported oculo-visual examination in the last two years.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Has read and signed an information consent letter;&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Is willing and able to follow instructions and maintain the appointment schedule;&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. No previous history of overnight contact lens wear or PMMA (polymethylmethacrylate)&#xD;
             lens wear.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Auto-refraction vertexed spherical equivalent between +4.00 and -8.00 (prescription&#xD;
             matching required between groups 1 &amp; 2). This criterion is non-applicable to&#xD;
             participants in group 3.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Is found to be in one of the study groups matched by age (±5 years), ethnicity (Asian&#xD;
             vs. non-Asian) and CL Rx (±2.00 D) according using the following criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
             GROUP 1: For the past (minimum) 6 months has ONLY worn spherical DDSH lenses AND prior&#xD;
             to wearing this lens they only wore SH material lenses in the past (minimum) 3 total&#xD;
             years.&#xD;
&#xD;
             GROUP 2: For the past (minimum) 6 months has ONLY worn spherical DDH lenses AND prior&#xD;
             to wearing this lens they only wore H material lenses in the past (minimum) 3 total&#xD;
             years.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. For groups 1 &amp; 2, currently and for at least the previous 6 months has had habitual&#xD;
             daily disposable wear schedule of at least 8 hrs a day, 5 days a week in only one&#xD;
             material category - either silicone hydrogel or hydrogel material. This criterion is&#xD;
             not-applicable to participants in group 3.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Is willing to wear the study contact lens in the randomized eye for 3 hours of eye&#xD;
             closure on the second study day. This criterion is not-applicable to participants in&#xD;
             group 3.&#xD;
&#xD;

             refraction or pinhole.&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Can achieve acceptable fit and comfort in the randomized eye with the study lens. This&#xD;
             criterion will be confirmed at the baseline visit (V1). This criterion is&#xD;
             not-applicable to participants in group 3.&#xD;

&#xD;
          3. Has any known active* ocular disease and/or infection;&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Has a systemic condition that in the opinion of the investigator may affect a study&#xD;
             measure or interfere with contact lens wear; this may include, but not be limited to,&#xD;

             xerophthalmia, acne rosacea, Stevens-Johnson syndromes, and systemic connective tissue&#xD;
             disorders e.g. rheumatoid arthritis.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Is using any systemic or topical medications that in the opinion of the investigator&#xD;

&#xD;
          6. Has known sensitivity to fluorescein dye, topical anesthetic, or products to be used&#xD;
             in the study;&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Appears to have any active* ocular pathology, ocular anomaly or severe insufficiency&#xD;
             of lacrimal secretion (severe dry eye) that would affect the wearing of contact&#xD;
             lenses;&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Appears to have any signs of corneal inflammation or previous infection or corneal&#xD;
             opacity/scar;&#xD;
&#xD;

             confirmation at the screening visit), due to potential ocular physiological changes,&#xD;
             such as changes in the corneal shape and cell types;&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Is aphakic;&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Has undergone refractive error surgery, or has a history of any ocular surgery or&#xD;
