      Two new male condoms have been developed - one made of synthetic nitrile and the other made&#xD;
      of latex graphene. Both new condoms are of the same design as a standard latex male condom.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Purpose: The aim of the study is to evaluate the functional performance of two new male&#xD;
      condoms compared to a control latex male condom.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design: The study is a randomized three-period cross-over trial of two new male condoms&#xD;
      and a control latex male condom. The study will enrol 240 couples, anticipating that at least&#xD;
      200 couples will complete the study. Each couple will be asked to use five latex graphene,&#xD;
      five synthetic nitrile and five latex male condoms in a randomized type order. Function,&#xD;
      safety, and acceptability will be assessed at three follow-up visits approximately one month&#xD;
      apart after enrolment. Couples will complete a Condom Log at their homes which gathers data&#xD;
      on experience after use of each condom.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objective: To ascertain the functional performance of a latex graphene and a&#xD;
      synthetic nitrile compared to a control latex male condom. Primary endpoints will be total&#xD;
      clinical failure and total condom failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives: Acceptability and safety data (as determined by the number of adverse&#xD;
      events) occurring with each male condom type.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Population: The target population will be 240 urban, sexually-active couples who are&#xD;
      experienced users of male condoms. Recruitment will be from the Commercial City MatCH&#xD;
      Research Unit (MRU) site and other workplace sites in the eThekwini District.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Men and women will be told about the study. If a man/woman expresses interest in&#xD;
      participating, they will be given the study information sheet to read, which will describe&#xD;
      the study requirements and their potential role/partners potential in the study. If they&#xD;
      agree to take part in the research, they will be asked to give the information sheet to their&#xD;
      partner. If both partners in the couple are willing to participate, they will be invited to&#xD;
      visit the enrolment site or the MRU Commercial City site and asked to provide written&#xD;
      informed consent. Both partners will be screened to ensure they meet the requirements for&#xD;
      study participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A physical examination will be undertaken to exclude visible symptoms of sexually transmitted&#xD;
      infections. If symptoms are observed the participant will be referred to a Department of&#xD;
      Health clinic or their doctor for treatment. A urine pregnancy test will be conducted at&#xD;
      screening to exclude pregnancy. Both partners in the couple will need to provide the study&#xD;
      with a copy of HIV results which are not older than 2 months. If HIV testing results are not&#xD;
      available, voluntary HIV counselling and testing will be offered and conducted by study&#xD;
      staff.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The consent process and all checklists, condom use logs and surveys used in the research will&#xD;
      be written and conducted in a language that is understandable to the participant, and all&#xD;
      relevant documents will be translated into isiZulu. Enrolled participants will be asked to&#xD;
      use five latex graphene, five synthetic nitrile and five latex male condoms. They will be&#xD;
      asked to return for follow-up after using five of each type of device.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At enrolment, baseline data will be gathered on participant demographics and past male condom&#xD;
      use via the baseline questionnaire using a dildo model, the study staff will demonstrate male&#xD;
      condom fitting and train the participants in the proper use of their first assigned male&#xD;
      condom. Further, they will re-emphasize the instructions on how to complete the condom use&#xD;
      log. Couples will be given one condom log to complete together. Couples will be told that&#xD;
      they do not have to use the study male condoms during consecutive acts of intercourse. They&#xD;
      will also be counselled on Pre Exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP) and referred to a local facility&#xD;
      that provides PrEP should they wish to initiate PrEP. The study staff will discuss with the&#xD;
      couple an approximate timeframe for use of all five condoms and a suitable follow-up date&#xD;
      will be scheduled. This date will be noted on an appointment slip. Couples will be encouraged&#xD;
      to come back if their condoms are finished before the due date and will be given the research&#xD;
      study contact details to call for any appointment changes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the first follow-up visit, couples will be interviewed about their first assigned&#xD;
      condom type and they will receive their next condom packet within their second assigned&#xD;
      (randomized) use sequence. In the second follow-up visit, couples will be interviewed about&#xD;
      their second assigned condom type and they will receive their next condom packet within their&#xD;
      third assigned (randomized) use sequence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the third follow-up visit, couples will be interviewed about their third assigned condom&#xD;
      type and will be discontinued from study participation. Data on device function, safety and&#xD;
      acceptability for each condom type will be collected during follow-up visits.&#xD;
