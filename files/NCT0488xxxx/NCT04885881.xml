  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Ozone (O2-O3) has been used as a supportive therapy in various musculoskeletal diseases such&#xD;
      as lumbosacral disc herniation, knee osteoarthritis, meniscus injury, shoulder&#xD;
      pathologies.The aim of this study is to investigate the effectiveness of ozone (O2-O3)&#xD;
      injection applied to the trigger point in the treatment of myofascial pain syndrome.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study was designed as a prospective, randomized, controlled trial. Fourty six people who&#xD;
      met the inclusion criteria will randomized into two groups of 23 people. The first group will&#xD;
      be designated as ozone therapy group and patients in the second group will be designated as&#xD;
      the lidocaine injection group. Patients will be evaluated with visuel analog scale&#xD;
      (10cm-VAS), Neck Disability Index (NDI), Pain Score (PS) and neck lateral flexion measurement&#xD;
      before and after treatment at 4 and 12 weeks.&#xD;

    <measure>Neck Pain</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, change from baseline VAS at 4 and 12 weeks after injection</time_frame>
    <description>Severity of pain was assessed using the standard 10 cm VAS with 0 meant &quot;no pain&quot; at one end, and 10 meant &quot;unbearable pain&quot; at the other end</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Neck Disability Index (NDI)</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, change from baseline NDI at 4 and 12 after injection</time_frame>
    <description>Neck Disability Index (NDI) is a self-report 10-item questionnaire used to evaluate the effect of neck pain on daily living activities. Each item is scored from 0 to 5. Higher scores of NDI indicate more disability and pain.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Pain Scor (PS)</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, change from baseline PS at 4 and 12 weeks after injection</time_frame>
    <description>Pain Scor (PS) measures the severity of pain felt at the trigger point by placing the thumb to the skin covering the muscle containing the trigger point in a perpendicular fashion and exerting pressure until there was whitening of the nail bed.</description>
