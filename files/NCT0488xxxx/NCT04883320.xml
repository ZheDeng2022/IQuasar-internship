    <textblock>
      The study is a pilot/laboratory study comparing the effects of MSC conditioned media on&#xD;
      samples of airway cells in 3 participant groups with mild/moderate asthma (5 participants),&#xD;
      severe asthma (5 participants), or no asthma (5 participants).&#xD;

      Asthma is a significant global health challenge with the prevalence of allergic asthma&#xD;
      increasing by 1% each year. Atopic asthma is a complex disorder driven by cellular mechanisms&#xD;
      in response to allergens. The response is two-fold; a chronic inflammatory response&#xD;
      accompanied by remodelling of the respiratory airways. Airway remodelling is characterised by&#xD;
      smooth muscle hypertrophy (and mucous gland) and hyperplasia, fibrosis of the sub-epithelium&#xD;
      and reticular basement thickening, and epithelial damage. Over time the airway suffers&#xD;
      remodelling due to thickening of the smooth muscle component which is in turn accompanied by&#xD;
      irreversible fibrotic changes and a tendency towards treatment unresponsiveness. The&#xD;
      inflammatory response on the other hand is characterised by IgE activation of mucous mast&#xD;
      cells, infiltration of eosinophils, increased CD4+Th2 lymphocytes, and Type 2 cytokine&#xD;
      secretion (e.g. IL13). The primary challenge in the development of new asthma treatments is&#xD;
      to deliver long-lasting relief to the inflammatory response and also to 'repair' the&#xD;
      remodelling associated with repeated asthmatic events. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSC), derived&#xD;
      primarily from the bone marrow, have a multipotent differentiation potential (primarily bone,&#xD;
      fat, and cartilage) and are currently in clinical trial for over 350 diseases and disorders.&#xD;
      These include diverse areas such as ischemic stroke, graft vs. host disease, Crohns disease,&#xD;
      and type 1 diabetes alongside anticipated applications related to the musculoskeletal system.&#xD;
      Their application into the treatment of musculoskeletal damage relies primarily on functional&#xD;
      incorporation (differentiation into the damaged tissue to repair in situ). In contrast their&#xD;
      application in many other instances is due to their unique inherent characteristic, namely&#xD;
      their immunomodulatory role. MSC secrete a wide range of growth factors and cytokines (the&#xD;
      secretome) which have the capacity to silence immune reactions preventing T cell activation.&#xD;
      In addition to this property the MSC secretome has also been shown to reverse the remodelling&#xD;
      associated with fibrotic disease.&#xD;

      Airway cells will be obtained from participants during bronchoscopy via biopsy, brush biopsy&#xD;
      and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL). To minimise discomfort the procedure will utilise the&#xD;
      sedative midazolam and local anaesthetic lidocaine.&#xD;

        Trial participants will be identified from those attending respiratory medicine outpatient&#xD;
