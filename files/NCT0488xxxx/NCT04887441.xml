  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Digital technology is essential in the field of health, via connected objects, the medical&#xD;
      Internet or even telemedicine; and the info-communication practices (ways of getting&#xD;
      information and communicating) of the actors go through digital devices. In addition, at&#xD;
      present, the mass of activity documents to be managed in healthcare establishments and an&#xD;
      abundant supply of documentary resources in health, available on the Internet, lead to&#xD;
      infobesity, information pollution, and work overload. These phenomena lead to an increase in&#xD;
      the time spent searching for relevant information and even to the burnout of healthcare&#xD;
      professionals. A contextualization of the information communication systems through which the&#xD;
      practices of health professionals pass therefore seems necessary so that the tools for&#xD;
      managing, extracting and organizing knowledge can support these actors in their work.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the field of allergies, there are many players, and the information that is useful to them&#xD;
      is abundant and heterogeneous. This study is based on the hypothesis that a knowledge&#xD;
      organization model, developed from existing practices, could make it possible to obtain&#xD;
      satisfactory results when searching for information, and be integrated into the daily&#xD;
      practices of actors by linking up with other already existing systems and tools.&#xD;

    <time_frame>24 months</time_frame>
    <description>measure (a) the efficiency of the model developed in the target technology (technology-focused evaluation), (b) the satisfaction of the professionals of the unit (user-focused evaluation) and (c) we will evaluate its formalization by an expert in knowledge organization systems (ontology-focused evaluation). The evaluations (a) and (b) will be made through the integration of the model into a future information communication device, and probably, into another existing device. The task will consist, for example, in the search for information and documents necessary for the information activities of professionals.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Assessment and validation of the model</measure>
    <time_frame>18 months</time_frame>
    <description>(a) At the end of the interrogation of a tool designed by professionals, we will calculate the recall rate, precision and F-measure. The efficiency of the model will be considered satisfactory, if the result obtained is equal or superior to other projects (b) The organizational model assessment will engage 10 professionals from the allergology unit. Professionals will assign (anonymously) the marks according to the level of satisfaction of the results of their request: 5 - Very satisfactory, 4 - Satisfactory, 3 - Fairly satisfactory, 2 - Unsatisfactory, 1 - Unsatisfactory. (c) The model will also be evaluated by a knowledge organization systems expert, selected from members of the International Society for Knowledge Organization.</description>
