  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic inflammation, which is defined as a persistent, low-grade inflammatory response&#xD;
      within the body, is associated with many of the negative health conditions which are&#xD;
      prevalent in our society today. It is most well-known for its role in the progression of&#xD;
      diseases including obesity, metabolic syndrome, cancer, cardiovascular disease, and diabetes.&#xD;
      Chronic inflammation is also linked to many of the underlying factors associated with disease&#xD;
      development including perturbations in sleep, and mental health status such as depression,&#xD;
      anxiety, fatigue, and quality of life. Natural killer cells, commonly referred to as NK&#xD;
      cells, are a subset of white blood cells that play an important role in the coordination of&#xD;
      inflammation in the body.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although many interventions aimed at controlling chronic inflammation and enhancing NK cell&#xD;
      number and activity have been explored, relatively few have been administered without&#xD;
      significant barriers. Cannabidiol (CBD), a non-psychoactive hemp derivative, is a potential,&#xD;
      attractive therapeutic target. However, there is very little information in humans that&#xD;
      addresses the potential of CBD to improve your health and immune function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The overall goal of this study is to explore the effects of 8-weeks of CBD supplementation on&#xD;
      mental and physical health, sleep measures, and NK cell number and cytotoxic function.&#xD;
      Specific Aim 1. Explore the effect of 8-weeks of CBD administration on sleep measures as well&#xD;
      as measures of mental and physical health in conjunction with measurements of NK cell number&#xD;
      and function.&#xD;

      In this double-blind investigation, participants will undergo 8 total visits separated by an&#xD;
      8-week intervention period. One week prior to the intervention period, participants will&#xD;
      complete a blood draw, body composition analysis, aerobic and anaerobic fitness analysis,&#xD;
      maximal strength testing, and physical activity and sleep quantity and quality analyses.&#xD;
      These tests will be completed again following the 8-week intervention period. Following the&#xD;
      first 4 visits, participants will be randomly assigned 1 of 2 groups: CBD (50mg/day) or&#xD;
      calorie matched placebo. Participants will then complete the 8-week intervention period.&#xD;
      Additionally, during week 4 of the 8-week intervention period (intervention midpoint),&#xD;
      participants will complete a blood draw, one full week of physical activity and sleep&#xD;
      actigraphy, surveys on mental health and wellbeing, and prevalence of sickness and illness&#xD;
