  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A French multicenter randomised and placebo-controlled study recruiting patients who present&#xD;
      neurovascular involvement related to GCA (&gt; 60 years) with symptomatic (stroke) or&#xD;
      asymptomatic forms. The aim of this study is to assess the efficacy of tocilizumab to induce&#xD;
      complete remission of GCA with cerebrovascular involvement (clinical and biological) and&#xD;
      absence of clinical and MRI ischemic stroke recurrence at 24 weeks.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Giant cell arteritis (GCA) in the elderly is considered a medical emergency in case of&#xD;
      ischemic complication, urgent treatment is needed and high doses of intravenous steroids are&#xD;
      used. To date, usual treatments added to steroids have not been shown to be effective in&#xD;
      reducing the risk of ischemic event recurrence in GCA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently, the efficacy of tocilizumab has been demonstrated as a steroid-sparing agent and a&#xD;
      long-term complete remission agent. The aim of this study is to address the potential&#xD;
      benefits of tocilizumab as induction therapy in combination with high dose steroids to&#xD;
      improve the neurovascular involvement in GCA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will enroll 66 subjects with GCA (according to ACR criteria or positive temporal&#xD;
      artery biopsy) and neurovascular involvement (symptomatic or asymptomatic). It consist of a&#xD;
      screening phase (up to 30 days), a baseline/randomization phase and a treatment phase with&#xD;
      experimental treatment or placebo (weekly administrated) which could be combined with usual&#xD;
      treatments for stroke as antiaggregants and/or anticoagulants (24 weeks). Regular visit will&#xD;
      be performed to follow the GCA remission, adverse treatments effects and proceed to&#xD;
      radiological and biological evaluations (visit assessment at weeks 2, 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24,&#xD;
      28, 32, 36) until end of study visit at week 52.&#xD;
