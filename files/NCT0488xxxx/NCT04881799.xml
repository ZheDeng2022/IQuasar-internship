  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      As the prevalence of obesity rises in the U.S., so does the incidence of pediatric type 2&#xD;
      diabetes (T2D), which is associated with more aggressive disease progression than in adults.&#xD;
      From 2002-2012, the incidence of T2D in youth increased by 7% annually in the U.S. Compared&#xD;
      to adults. T2D in adolescents is a much more progressive and recalcitrant disease,&#xD;
      characterized by more rapid deterioration of β-cell function and earlier incidence of&#xD;
      exogenous insulin dependence and diabetes-related comorbidities. A potential factor that&#xD;
      drives the rapid progression of adolescent T2D is obesity (body mass index [BMI] &gt;95th&#xD;
      percentile. Effective and safe treatments targeting both obesity and β-cell dysfunction are&#xD;
      needed for pediatric T2D.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In 2012, the FDA approved the use of Phentermine/Topiramate for the treatment of obesity in&#xD;
      adults. This orally-administered medication is available in mid- (phentermine 7.5 mg;&#xD;
      topiramate 46 mg) and high- (phentermine 15 mg; topiramate 92 mg) doses, administered once&#xD;
      per day. In a meta-analysis, phentermine/topiramate was shown to be one of the most effective&#xD;
      obesity medication currently available. A large dose-ranging trial in adults evaluating&#xD;
      phentermine and topiramate as monotherapies vs. phentermine/topiramate demonstrated superior&#xD;
      efficacy of the combination with an acceptable safety profile.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Results from a large phase III clinical trial demonstrated placebo-subtracted weight loss of&#xD;
      &gt;9% with treatment for one year at the top dose. Importantly, a separate trial demonstrated&#xD;
      that the treatment effect is durable out to at least two years.41 The most common side&#xD;
      effects in these trials were paresthesia, dizziness, dysgeusia, insomnia, constipation, and&#xD;
      dry mouth. Improvements were noted in blood pressure, lipids, glucose, insulin, HOMA-IR,&#xD;
      C-reactive protein, and adiponectin.&#xD;

      This is a pilot, pragmatic, randomized trial with a 6-month placebo-controlled period&#xD;
      followed by a 6-month open-label extension, investigating the effects of&#xD;
      phentermine/topiramate on BMI, insulin sensitivity, and glycemic control compared to placebo&#xD;
      plus standard treatment (metformin+insulin) in adolescents with T2D. The purpose of this&#xD;
      study is to 1) evaluate the effects of phentermine/topiramate vs. placebo+ standard treatment&#xD;
      on BMI in adolescents with T2D and obesity and 2) evaluate the effects of&#xD;
      phentermine/topiramate vs. placebo + standard treatment on insulin sensitivity and B-cell&#xD;
      function in adolescents with T2D and obesity.&#xD;

Individuals, when randomized to phentermine/topiramate therapy will initiate treatment at 3.75 mg/23 mg orally once daily in the morning for 14 days. It will then be increased to 7.5 mg/46 mg orally once daily in the morning for 14 days. It will the be increased to 11.25 mg/69 mg orally once daily in the morning for 14 days and finally to 15 mg/92 mg orally once daily in the morning.</intervention_model_description>
