    <textblock>
      This study examines the impact of virtual reality compared to sedation (midazolam and/or&#xD;
      fentanyl) and no intervention on pain experienced from an epidural steroid injection (ESI).&#xD;
      The intervention group (who receive virtual reality as a distraction modality) is compared to&#xD;
      a sedation group and a control group.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All patients enrolled in the study will already be undergoing lumbar epidural steroid&#xD;
      injections for lumbar radicular pain as part of their clinical care. The epidural approach&#xD;
      will either be transforaminal or interlaminar depending on clinical judgment (i.e.&#xD;
      transforaminal ESI for unilateral pain, interlaminar ESI for bilateral pain). The study will&#xD;
      consist of 3 groups: virtual reality, sedation, and a control group which receives no&#xD;
      intervention (i.e. standard of care). The virtual reality group will receive virtual reality&#xD;
      via a headset containing a menu of 6 programs that the subject can choose; the sedation group&#xD;
      will receive from 1-5 mg of midazolam and up to 150 mcg of fentanyl as clinically indicated,&#xD;
      and the control group will not receive an intervention (standard of care). All subjects will&#xD;
      also receive 1% lidocaine local anesthetic through a 25-gauge needle for superficial&#xD;
      anesthesia, which is standard of care. Subjects will be randomized to each of these groups,&#xD;
      with sub-allocation being done stratified by the type of ESI (transforaminal vs.&#xD;
      interlaminar).&#xD;

    <description>Conscious sedation will be accomplished by the use of midazolam and/ or fentanyl.
