  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Coronary artery calcification (CAC) is a common complication of type 2 diabetes&#xD;
      mellitus(T2DM), which can significantly increase all-cause mortality and the incidence of&#xD;
      serious cardiovascular events, and increase the burden of the national economy. The&#xD;
      epidemiological characteristics and the clinical progress of CAC are still not clear.&#xD;
      Moreover, the pathogenesis of CAC has not yet been fully elucidated, and lack of specific&#xD;
      diagnostic indicators. Arterial calcification is an active, reversible, and multifactorial&#xD;
      biological process like bone formation. It is generally believed that early detection of&#xD;
      calcification lesions and active targeted treatment may be the key to prevention and&#xD;
      treatment of vascular calcification. In addition, statins are commonly used in patients with&#xD;
      dyslipidemia and can stabilize CAC plaque. However, the timing, dosage and effect of statins&#xD;
      are controversial. Moreover, our previous study found that the expression of miR-32 is&#xD;
      significantly elevated in patients with CAC, and can promoting vascular calcification.&#xD;
      Herein, this study is to conduct a prospective cohort study on T2DM patients with CAC in&#xD;
      Hunan province through a multidisciplinary and multi-center cooperation model, the main&#xD;
      research objectives include the following three parts: ① To identify the prevalence,&#xD;
      incidence, and characteristics of CAC in T2DM patients in Hunan province, and to build a risk&#xD;
      assessment model. ② To observe the effects of statins on the occurrence and development of&#xD;
      CAC in patients with T2DM, and to provide clinical data for the improvement of medication&#xD;
      guidelines; ③To observe the dynamic changes of serum miR-32 in the progression of CAC in&#xD;
      patients with T2DM, and to explore its possibility as a serological diagnosis or prognostic&#xD;
      bio-maker of CAC. The completion of this research project is expected to bring a new&#xD;
      breakthrough in the field of early diagnosis, prognosis evaluation, and intervention&#xD;
      treatment of patients with T2DM combined with CAC, and provide an important reference for the&#xD;
      formulation of cardiovascular disease prevention and control strategy.&#xD;

      The prospective cohort study of type 2 diabetes mellitus(T2DM) with coronary artery&#xD;
      calcification (CAC) is a multi-center, observational clinical study. The study included a&#xD;
      baseline survey and 8-year follow-up survey of hospitalized patients with T2DM in seven&#xD;
      third-class hospital in Hunan Province (the follow-up is divided into two stages, the first&#xD;
      stage is the first 4 years, and the second stage is the last 4 years). The first phase is&#xD;
      conducted in three affiliated hospitals of University of South China in Hengyang City, Hunan&#xD;
      Province, and the second phase is conducted in four representative Grade-A hospitals&#xD;
      according to the geographical location of Hunan Province. The sample size of each center is&#xD;
      set to be at least 200 cases, and that of a single center is at most 500 cases. The diagnosis&#xD;
      of T2DM is made according to the criteria of the WHO in 1999, and the hyperglycemia caused by&#xD;
      type 1 diabetes, gestational diabetes, special type diabetes and other factors are excluded.&#xD;
      The volume and density of coronary artery calcification are evaluated by low dose&#xD;
      prospectively triggered sequential dual-source CT coronary angiography. The coronary artery&#xD;
      calcification score (CACS) is calculated by CAS coring software. MiR-32 is detected by PCR.&#xD;
      All in all, this clinical trial is aiming to establishing a prospective long-term follow-up&#xD;
      cohort of patients with T2DM complicated with CAC in Hunan Province, to observing the effect&#xD;
      of statins on the occurrence and development of CAC in patients with T2DM, and to exploring&#xD;
      the dynamic changes of serum miR-32 in this process to determine whether it can be used as an&#xD;
      early diagnosis and prognostic marker of vascular calcification.&#xD;
