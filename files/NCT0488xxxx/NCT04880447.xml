      Post-marketing study, Cohort study of COMIRNATY vaccines. To collect information on adverse&#xD;
      events and COVID-19 observed after vaccination with COMIRNATY and to assess safety in&#xD;
      patients with underlying disease considered to be at high risk of aggravation of COVID-19 who&#xD;

      This is a multicenter cohort study to be conducted in individuals with underlying diseases&#xD;
      considered to be at high risk of aggravation of COVID-19 who are vaccinated with this&#xD;
      product, and the investigator will enter the information required in this study in the case&#xD;
      report forms (CRFs) based on the information obtained through preliminary examination sheet&#xD;
      or medical interview, etc. and records such as medical records. A health observation diary&#xD;
      will be distributed to the subjects participating in this study and they will be requested to&#xD;
      record information on local reactions and systemic reactions after vaccination with this&#xD;
      product.&#xD;
