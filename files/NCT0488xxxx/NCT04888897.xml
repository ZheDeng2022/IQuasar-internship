  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Opioids are morphine-type medicines which come from the opium poppy or are similar-to&#xD;
      morphine. They are very effective for short-term pain, cancer pain, and pain at the end of&#xD;
      life. Opioids are thought to be less useful for treating long-term non-cancer pain. Side&#xD;
      effects are common and can be serious. People who take opioids for longer periods are at risk&#xD;
      of tolerance (needing a higher dose to get the same effect), dependence (unable to cut down&#xD;
      or stop without withdrawal effects), and addiction (uncontrollable use despite harmful&#xD;
      consequences).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the UK, opioid prescribing has increased substantially over the last two decades. Doses&#xD;
      are higher and opioids are taken for longer, suggesting many people are at risk of harmful&#xD;
      effects without useful pain relief. Research into opioid dependence and addiction has found&#xD;
      people do not always fully understand the risks of these medicines at the start of treatment.&#xD;
      Local Community Pharmacists could be used to improve information and support for those&#xD;
      prescribed opioids.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aims to get a better understanding of the experiences of people prescribed opioids&#xD;
      and their information and support needs, and to investigate whether information and support&#xD;
      could be improved using Community Pharmacists. Findings may improve care for people&#xD;
      prescribed opioids in the future.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will involve questionnaires and interviews with adults prescribed an opioid&#xD;
      medicine for pain, not caused by cancer, over a period of at least 3 months. Participants&#xD;
      will be recruited from GP practices in England.&#xD;

        Patients registered with a GP practice in England who have been prescribed an opioid&#xD;
        medicine for non-cancer pain by their GP over a period of at least 3 months. Purposive&#xD;
        sampling of GP practices within the NIHR CRN East Midlands is planned. We aim to utilise a&#xD;
        sample of practices with a range of characteristics which are representative of GP&#xD;
        practices across the East Midlands.&#xD;
