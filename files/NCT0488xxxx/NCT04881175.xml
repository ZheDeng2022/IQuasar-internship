  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, open-labeled, non-randomized, multi-center clinical study to collect&#xD;
      efficacy data on the TempSure FlexSure applicator for fat lipolysis.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Subjects will attend a screening/pretreatment visit which may be performed on the same day as&#xD;
      the treatment visit. Subjects may receive up to 5 treatments every 1-2 weeks on the abdomen&#xD;
      or flanks.&#xD;

    <measure>Changes in Histology of Biopsy</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, immediately post last treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Photographs of the histological samples before and after the last treatment will be examined for normal structures, cell viability, vascular injury, overall morphologic traits, and any indications of the healing response. The number of samples that experience each of these histological changes compared to the baseline will be recorded. To determine whether or not the samples are expressing histological changes, a pathologist will look at the histology of each individual sample and record if they see any changes in histology (which are observable to the eye), and what they are. Then, the number of biopsy samples that express each found histological change will be counted.</description>
