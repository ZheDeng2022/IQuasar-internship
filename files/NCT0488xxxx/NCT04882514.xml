  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the safety and antibody (germ fighters) response&#xD;
      of experimental (investigational) vaccine candidates against the germ group A streptococcus&#xD;
      when injected into the arm of healthy adults.&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Group A streptococcus (GAS) is a bacteria that cause a number of different infections that&#xD;
      range from mild illnesses to deadly diseases. It is estimated 500,000 deaths occur worldwide&#xD;
      each year from GAS. To address these high rates of disease, the investigators want to test a&#xD;
      new potential vaccine for safety and immune response in healthy participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To test the new vaccine, the investigators are proposing a two-phase study. Phase 1 of the&#xD;
      study will be dose-escalating based on safety. 8 participants will receive 1 injection into&#xD;
      the muscle in the phase 1 portion of the study in a 2x2x2x2 design whereby 2 participants&#xD;
      will receive the lowest dose of vaccine and be assessed for 3 weeks. If there are no safety&#xD;
      concerns the next 2 participants will receive the second-highest dose of vaccine and be&#xD;
      assessed for 3 weeks. The dose increase will occur until all 8 patients have completed a&#xD;
      3-week assessment period for safety.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If there are no safety concerns after all 4 vaccine arms have been assessed, the study will&#xD;
      proceed to a phase 2 double-blind randomized clinical trial. 37 healthy participants will be&#xD;
      randomized to 1 of 5 arms of the study (1 placebo, and 4 experimental treatment arms from&#xD;
      phase 1). Following a screening appointment, the participants will each receive 3 injections&#xD;
      (baseline, 3 weeks, and 6 weeks) in addition to 2 follow up visits for total participation of&#xD;
      approx 10 months.&#xD;
