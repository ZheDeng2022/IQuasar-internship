  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective is to evaluate the efficacy of brexucabtagene autoleucel (KTE-X19) in&#xD;
      participants with relapsed/refractory (r/r) mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) in Cohort 3 of this&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Study KTE-C19-102 (NCT02601313) enrolled participants with r/r MCL who have been treated with&#xD;
      up to 5 prior regimens including a Bruton's tyrosine kinase inhibitor (BTKi) in Cohort 1 and&#xD;
      Cohort 2. However, to fulfill FDA Postmarketing Requirement Cohort 3 is added to the study.&#xD;
      It will include participants with r/r MCL who have been treated with up to 5 prior regimens&#xD;
      but have not received prior therapy with a BTKi.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary analysis in Cohort 1 and Cohort 2 is already completed. Data for Cohort 3 will be&#xD;
      analyzed separately. Therefore, this separate registration is only for Cohort 3.&#xD;

    <measure>Change Over Time in European Quality of Life-5 Dimensions(EQ-5D) Scale Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and up to 24 months</time_frame>
    <description>The European Quality of Life-5 Dimensions Health Questionnaire (EQ-5D) is a participant-answered questionnaire scoring 5 dimensions of health: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression. For each dimension the participant is asked for a three-level assessment of their health on the current day: &quot;no problems&quot; (1), &quot;some problems&quot; (2), &quot;extreme problems&quot; (3). EQ-5D health states, defined by the EQ-5D descriptive system, are converted into a single summary index by applying a formula that attaches values (also called QOL weights or QOL utilities) to each of the levels in each dimension. EQ-5D Summary Index values range from -0.11 (worst health state) to 1.00 (perfect health state). Positive numbers indicate improvement from baseline.</description>

    <measure>Change Over Time in European Quality of Life-5 Dimensions(EQ-5D) Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and up to 24 months</time_frame>
    <description>EQ-5D is a standardized participant completed questionnaire that measures health-related quality of life and translates that score into an index value or utility score. EQ-5D-consists of two components: a health state profile and an optional visual analogue scale (VAS). The EQ5D-VAS records the participant's self-rated health on a vertical visual analogue scale, where the endpoints are labelled 'The best health you can imagine' and 'The worst health you can imagine'. EQ-5D-VAS: range 0 to 100. A higher score indicates better self-reported health status.</description>

    <measure>Changes in the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire (EORTC-QLQ-C30) Score from Baseline Over Time</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and up to 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>EORTC QLQ-C30 includes functional scales (physical, role, cognitive, emotional, and social), global health status, symptom scales (fatigue, pain, nausea/vomiting), and single items (dyspnoea, appetite loss, insomnia, constipation/diarrhea and financial difficulties). Most questions use 4 point scale (1 'Not at all' to 4 'Very much'; 2 questions used 7-point scale (1 'very poor' to 7 'Excellent'). Scores are averaged, transformed to 0-100 scale; higher score indicate high QoL. A positive change from baseline indicates better quality of life.</description>
