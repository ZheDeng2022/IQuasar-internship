      The purpose of this study is to determine the effect of a weight-loss diet on body&#xD;
      composition in women who practice reformer pilates for 12 weeks. It compares dietary habits&#xD;
      and macro and micronutrient intakes in subjects with and without a weight-loss diet at the&#xD;

      The effect of a weight-loss diet on body composition in women reformer pilates for 12 weeks&#xD;
      was compared in this study. It compares dietary habits and macro and micronutrient intakes in&#xD;
      subjects with and without a weight-loss diet at the start and end of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 49 women (18 years old) were randomly assigned to one of two groups: control (CG:&#xD;
      reformer pilates; n=23) or study (SG: reformer pilates + weight-loss diet; n=26). Subjects in&#xD;
      both groups did pilates for 45 minutes three times a week for a total of 12 weeks. At the&#xD;
      start and end of the study, their body weight (kg), waist circumference (cm), hip&#xD;
      circumference (cm), neck circumference (cm), mid-upper arm circumference (cm), and body&#xD;
      composition [body fat (% ), body water (% ), body muscle (% )] were all measured. Their&#xD;
      waist/height ratio and body mass index (kg/m2) were also measured at the start and end of the&#xD;
      study. All subjects' dietary habits were questioned, their 24-hour retrospective food&#xD;
      consumption was recorded, and their physical activity levels were assessed using the&#xD;
      International Physical Activity Questionnaire (Short Form).&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>For a period of 12 weeks, subjects in the Study Group (SG) and Control Group (CG) groups received three 45-minute sessions of Pilates exercises per week.&#xD;
Study Group: In addition to Pilates, she followed a three-month weight-loss diet based on Turkey Dietary Guidelines, as prescribed by the dietician. These diet plans were designed to ensure that carbohydrates provided 45-60% of the energy, protein provided 10-20%, and fat provided 20-35 percent.&#xD;
Control Group: The women in the control group did only reformer pilates for three months. They were followed up for not applying any diet.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>Their physical activity levels were evaluated through the International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ Short Form). This form had seven questions and asked about the amount of time spent sitting, walking, moderate, and vigorous activities. The total score accounted for the duration (minutes) and frequency (days) of the activities completed. Physical inactivity (600 MET -min/week), low physical activity (600-3000 MET -min/week), and adequate physical activity (with health benefits) (&gt;3000 MET -min/week) were defined.</description>

    <description>The study group does reformer pilates for 45 minutes 3 days a week. The intensity of the workouts was gradually increased. Warm-up (10 minutes), main Pilates training activity (25 minutes), and cool-down (10 minutes) were the three parts of each session (10 minutes). In addition to pilates, the women in the SG followed a personalized weight loss diet. In accordance with Turkey Dietary Guidelines, these diet plans were designed to provide 45-60% of energy from carbohydrates, 10-20% from protein, and 20-35 percent from fat.</description>
