  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The pathophysiological processes involved in COVID-19 pneumonia are not fully understood.&#xD;
      Specific alterations of the airways, lung parenchyma and pulmonary vascular tree could&#xD;
      explain a severe ventilation/perfusion heterogeneity resulting in severe hypoxemia during the&#xD;
      active phase of the disease. Additional skeletal muscle impairment related to systemic&#xD;
      inflammation may also explain persisting symptoms in the follow-up phase. The first aim of&#xD;
      the present project is to explore these different processes by evaluating the impact of the&#xD;
      COVID-19 pneumonia on exercise capacity, pulmonary function and perfusion by a physiological&#xD;
      and radiologic study. An ambulatory pulmonary rehabilitation will also be studied to assess&#xD;
      its impact on the physiological parameter mentioned and the health-related quality of life&#xD;
      questionnaire as a potential long-term treatment. The investigators propose a single center&#xD;
      randomized controlled study at the University Hospitals of Geneva. 60 adult patients having&#xD;
      suffered a hypoxemic COVID-19 pneumonia with persistent symptoms at 3-months after hospital&#xD;
      discharge will be included. A functional and physiological study will be performed, including&#xD;
      a six-minute walk test, pulmonary function testing, diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide,&#xD;
      maximal inspiratory pressure and sniff nasal inspiratory pressure. Those with at least one&#xD;
      abnormal value will be invited to fill the Saint Georges Respiratory Questionnaire, the Short&#xD;
      Form 36 and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale and will undergo a chest dual energy&#xD;
      computed tomography (DECT), a cardiopulmonary exercise testing with non-invasive cardiac&#xD;
      output and stroke volume evaluation and an evaluation of the pulmonary shunt by hyperoxia&#xD;
      (100% oxygen breathing) at rest and during light effort. Then patients will be randomized on&#xD;
      a 1:1 basis for pulmonary rehabilitation program or usual care. All work-up except DECT will&#xD;
      be repeated at 6 and 12 months after hospital discharge. The investigators hypothesize that&#xD;
      our study will allow a better understanding of pathophysiological mechanisms involved in&#xD;
      COVID-19. This will potentially determine therapeutic target for patients with persisting&#xD;
      symptoms and functional decay after COVID-19. The investigators also expect to see an&#xD;
      improvement of exercise capacity and physiological parameters in the pulmonary rehabilitation&#xD;
      group, as compared to the control group, suggesting pulmonary rehabilitation as a possible&#xD;
      long-term treatment of this condition.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      COVID-19 is an emerging pandemic disease caused by a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) since&#xD;
      December 2019. This condition may be associated with a severe pneumonia and an acute&#xD;
      respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) resulting in a high mortality and morbidity.A&#xD;
      standardized follow up of COVID-19 patients after discharge from Geneva University Hospitals&#xD;
      (Covicare) was implemented since March 29th 2020 by the divisions of infectious disease and&#xD;
      respiratory medicine, in association with the primary care medicine department. A follow-up&#xD;
      is ensured until one month after discharge. All patients are registered in a database&#xD;
      (REDCapTM,Tennessee, USA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The pathophysiological mechanisms of ARDS in COVID-19 and its long-term consequences on&#xD;
      respiratory and cardiovascular systems remain unclear. Several histopathological studies have&#xD;
      demonstrated occurrence of interstitial lung disease. Furthermore, there are some reports of&#xD;
      associated endothelitis, thrombosis in the microcirculation5 and a high prevalence of venous&#xD;
      thrombo-embolic events in ICU admitted patients, with pulmonary embolism accounting for 85%&#xD;
      of those events.Both these changes contribute to increase heterogeneity of ventilation -&#xD;
      perfusion ratio (VA/Q), thereby widening the alveolar - arterial oxygen gradient, and thus&#xD;
      causing serious hypoxaemia, with remarkable fall of arterial oxygen saturation (SaO2).&#xD;
      Finally, the interstitial pneumopathy may cause a persisting reduction of lung diffusing&#xD;
      capacity for carbon monoxide (DLCO), further decreasing SaO2 even after recovery from&#xD;
      COVID-19 pneumonia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Chest Dual-Energy Computed Tomography (DECT) enables a combined functional and morphological&#xD;
      analysis of the lung in a single and simple acquisition. Because of the attenuation&#xD;
      properties of iodine at two different photon energies (80 and 140kV), DECT is able to reveal&#xD;
      pulmonary blood volume distribution and generate color-coded pulmonary iodine volume maps,&#xD;
      corresponding to the pulmonary perfusion. These pulmonary perfusion maps allow a qualitative&#xD;
      analysis of the perfusion.Furthermore, the iodine concentration of the lung confers an&#xD;
      objective and quantitative regional analysis of the perfusion. In comparison with a&#xD;
      conventional CT, no additional intravenous iodine contrast medium injection or radiation&#xD;
      doses are needed; a functional image processing is simply added. We recently demonstrated how&#xD;
      DECT may help to define lung perfusion changes after therapeutic measures in patients with&#xD;
      chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Moreover, DECT offers an excellent correlation with&#xD;
      perfusion scintigraphy (V/Q scan). DECT also offers a superior anatomic and functional&#xD;
      comprehension by simultaneously recording the vascular anatomy, parenchymal morphology, and&#xD;
      functional perfusion. Consequently, DECT may provide important information both on persisting&#xD;
      parenchymal and perfusion alteration after COVID-19.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to the pulmonary component, the systemic inflammation state due to the concurring&#xD;
      &quot;cytokine storm syndrome&quot; may have an important role in the development of neuromuscular&#xD;
      alterations, independently of direct consequences of hospitalization in intensive care unit.&#xD;
      Neuromuscular alterations concur with lung function impairment in compromising the functional&#xD;
      state of the patient. As a consequence, we ought to expect a reduction of physical exercise&#xD;
      capacity, which is normally determined by a VO2max measurement during cardiopulmonary&#xD;
      exercise test (CPET) and by means of the six-minute walk test (6MWT).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Moreover, it is well described that ARDS is associated with a significant long-term&#xD;
      morbidity. At one year, 80% of ARDS survivors have a reduced diffusing capacity and 20%&#xD;
      suffer from an airflow obstruction. 35% of patients have an exercise limitation based on the&#xD;
      6MWT at two years. Moreover, impairment in lung function, musculoskeletal dysfunction and&#xD;
      functional limitation are linked to health-related quality of life (HRQL) decrement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Studies from a cohort of patients who suffered from ARDS due to SARS-CoV-1 in 2002 showed a&#xD;
      positive correlation between lung function and the HRQL physical functioning domain. Distance&#xD;
      performed during 6MWT correlated also with almost all Short Form Health Survey-36 (SF-36)&#xD;
      domains. Furthermore, mood disorders are commonly described in ARDS survivors, with studies&#xD;
      reporting up to 50% of depression at one year in this population. Depression and anxiety are&#xD;
      themselves associated with lower HRQL scores.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pulmonary rehabilitation has been shown to improve HRQL, maximal exercise capacity and 6MWD&#xD;
      in chronic pulmonary disease. It was also shown that 2 months of ambulatory pulmonary&#xD;
      rehabilitation improved pulmonary function and the St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire&#xD;
      (SGRQ) at 3 and 6 months post-discharge following recovery from ARDS due to severe influenza&#xD;
      A (H1N1 in 2009) pneumonitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is 1/ to explore the long-term impact of COVID-19 on physiological&#xD;
      respiratory parameters, functional capacity, HRQL and mood disturbances ; 2/ to assess the&#xD;
      benefit of a pulmonary rehabilitation program on these outcomes through a randomized-control&#xD;
      study, and 3/ to determine the contribution of DECT to the understanding of the&#xD;
      pathophysiological alterations in patients with functional sequelae of COVID-19 infection.&#xD;
