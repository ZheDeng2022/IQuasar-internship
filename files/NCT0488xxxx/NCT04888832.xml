  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      More than a dozen states have proposed or plan to implement work requirements in Medicaid,&#xD;
      and similar requirements already exist nationally in the Supplemental Nutritional Assistance&#xD;
      Program (SNAP), yet evidence on the effects of these policies is limited. In cooperation with&#xD;
      the state of Virginia, the investigators plan to conduct a randomized controlled trial&#xD;
      studying the impacts of work requirements in public programs on insurance coverage, SNAP&#xD;
      participation, employment, and health, with a particular focus on changes in racial/ethnic&#xD;
      and geographic disparities in these outcomes. The COVID-19 epidemic and concurrent economic&#xD;
      downturn creates additional urgency around these issues, and the investigators will use a&#xD;
      combination of national administrative data and a new population survey to assess disparities&#xD;
      in employment, health care, and food insecurity during this crisis.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Work requirements are becoming increasingly common in major public assistance programs, with&#xD;
      federal requirements for most adults to work in order to participate in the Supplemental&#xD;
      Nutritional Assistance Program (SNAP, previously known as food stamps), and more than a dozen&#xD;
      states proposing similar requirements in Medicaid. Proponents of work requirements contend&#xD;
      that these policies increase beneficiary engagement in work and community activities that may&#xD;
      lead to higher incomes and better health. On the other hand, opponents of work requirements&#xD;
      suggest that many low-resource households will lose much-needed benefits, without&#xD;
      commensurate improvements in employment. The investigators propose a randomized controlled&#xD;
      trial of work requirements in Virginia, leveraging state support for exempting a portion of&#xD;
      Medicaid expansion enrollees from the state's proposed work requirements. The investigators&#xD;
      are also working with the state to explore the impact of work requirements in SNAP. They will&#xD;
      study the impacts of each policy on health insurance coverage, access to care, employment,&#xD;
      food insecurity, and health outcomes using a mix of administrative data and a new beneficiary&#xD;
      survey. Our analysis will oversample several populations of interest, including racial/ethnic&#xD;
      minorities and low-income rural residents. In doing so, investigators will identify the&#xD;
      overall policy impacts of these policies, and will also assess who is most affected by each&#xD;
      component to determine the impact of these policy changes on racial, ethnic, socioeconomic,&#xD;
      and geographic disparities. Meanwhile, the COVID-19 epidemic and concurrent economic downturn&#xD;
      create additional urgency around the issues of employment and participation in social&#xD;
      programs. Using a combination of national administrative data and a new population survey,&#xD;
      this study will also provide a timely assessment of disparities in employment, health care,&#xD;
      and food insecurity during the current public health and economic crises.&#xD;
