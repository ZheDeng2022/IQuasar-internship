      Aims: Nondiabetic patients have been studied to determine whether modest elevations in plasma&#xD;
      mannose levels may be associated with a greater incidence of coronary artery disease (CAD).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: The plasma mannose, lipids (triglyceride, LDL, HDL, LDL, VLDL) and LDH levels were&#xD;
      successfully will be evaluated with respect to subsequent coronary artery disease using&#xD;
      records 120 nondiabetic patients and 120 healthy volunteers. CAD was identified from&#xD;
      myocardial infarction and new diagnoses of angina.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The associations between mannose levels and serum lipid parameters will be investigated.&#xD;

      Coronary artery disease (CAD), also known as coronary heart disease (CHD) or ischemic heart&#xD;
      disease (IHD), entails a decrease of blood flow to the heart muscle as a result of plaque&#xD;
      build-up in the arteries of the heart. CAD are among the world's leading causes of mortality&#xD;
      and morbidity, following rapid change and advancement of cardiovascular diagnosis and&#xD;
      treatment methods.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The broad range of lipid molecular species in human plasma and their possible role in human&#xD;
      health and disease are topics of great interest. Plasma lipidome is now progressively&#xD;
      recognized as a potentially important marker of chronic diseases, but the exact degree of its&#xD;
      contribution to the interindividual phenotypic variation in family studies is uncertain .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Associative evidence gathered from plasma lipidomic studies promises vital contributions to&#xD;
      biomarker research-an important cornerstone of ongoing efforts to prevent chronic disease.&#xD;
      The plasma lipidomic profile of humans is associated with various conditions including&#xD;
      obesity and disorders of glucose metabolism, hypertension , cardiovascular diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Plasma lipids are solubilized and distributed by associating them with different protein&#xD;
      groups. Most free fatty acids and associated structures with carboxyl functional groups&#xD;
      interact with albumin, while more complex lipids are transported and distributed using plasma&#xD;
      lipoproteins.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Glycerolipids account for a high proportion of total lipids in plasma and include&#xD;
      triacylglycerols (TAGs), diacylglycerols (DAGs), and ether-linked glycerolipids. The total&#xD;
      plasma concentration of TAGs, allocated between chylomicrons and very-low-density lipoprotein&#xD;
      (VLDL), depends on food intake. It is well known that various acquired or secondary risk&#xD;
      factors (including genetic determinants, uncontrolled diabetes mellitus, obesity, and&#xD;
      sedentary lifestyle) can cause hypertriglyceridemia, a prevalent type of dyslipidemia that is&#xD;
      often associated with premature coronary artery disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      D-mannose, one of the stereoisomers forms, is a structural isomer of D-glucose and commonly&#xD;
      found in biological systems, but L-mannose is generally not found in biological systems.&#xD;
      Mannose is transported to mammalian cells by hexose transporters primarily by glucose&#xD;
      transporters (GLUTs) present in the plasma membrane. Studies demonstrated that plasma mannose&#xD;
      levels in human are associated with incident type 2 diabetes mellitus and cardiocascular&#xD;
      diseases. On the other hand, molecular mechanism by which the pathway is induced is still&#xD;
      unclear. A recent study showed that human plasma lipidome is pleiotropically associated with&#xD;
      the cardiovascular risk factors and death.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In mammalian cells, mannose is joined in glycolysis and gluconeogenesis pathways catalyzed by&#xD;
      mannose phosphate isomerase. Mannose is a constituent of normal blood plasma and its&#xD;
      concentration is generally elevated in diabetes mellitus and chronic glomerulonephritis .&#xD;
      However, studies showed that fructose and mannose levels are significantly reduced in obese&#xD;
      individuals . Currently, we have reported that elevated baseline mannose in plasma triggered&#xD;
      to GLUT4 and Heksokinase-1 (HK1) associated with a progressive risk of CAD with time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A cytoplasmic enzyme of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) found in all body cells which transfers a&#xD;
      hydride from one molecule to another. LDH catalyzes the reversible conversion of pyruvate to&#xD;
      lactate as a unit of Cori cycle. A cardiac marker of LDH is expressed extensively in body&#xD;
      cells and a marker of heart failure .&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aims of the study were to determine whether modest elevations in plasma mannose&#xD;
      concentrations, and serum lipids [triglyceride, low density lipoprotein (LDL), high density&#xD;
      lipoprotein (HDL) and very-low density lipoprotein (VLDL)] may be associated with a greater&#xD;
      incidence of CAD among nondiabetic patients. Because hyperglycemia and/or hydrophilicity is&#xD;
      associated with additional risk factors for CAD including hypertension, obesity, aging.&#xD;
      Additionally, identifying the molecular and biochemical parameters in plasma associated with&#xD;
      risk factors for CAD may have strategic importance in the treatment of these diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patient and control groups will be initially informed about the study and obtained a&#xD;
      written consent. Patients who underwent angiography at the Department of Cardiology and newly&#xD;
      diagnosed as coronary artery disease and who weren't on statin treatment will be included in&#xD;
      the patient group. The control group will be consisted of healthy people with normal coronary&#xD;
      arteries angiographically. Patients with chronic renal failure, chronic liver disease,&#xD;
      inflammatory disease, diabetes, insulin resistance, major metabolic or endocrine disease will&#xD;
      be also excluded. For this purpose, age and sex matched 120 patients and 120 healthy&#xD;
      volunteers will be admitted to study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood samples will be collected as described earlier into EDTA and citrate vacutainers.Total&#xD;
      cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein and triglycerides will be measured by a commercially&#xD;
      available enzymatic colorimetric assay (Roche, Basel,Switzerland). Glucose, creatinine and&#xD;
      the other blood profiles will be determined by standard methods.The samples will be&#xD;
      centrifuged at 400xg for 10 min to separate the serum.Biochemical parameters will be measured&#xD;
      by using an Abbott ARCHITECH c800(Abbott Laboratories, USA) auto analyser and commercial&#xD;
      kits. Serum mannose levels will be determined by enzymatic methods using in the ELISA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Kolmogrov-Smirnov test will be used to determine whether the group was parametrically&#xD;
      distributed. Categorical variables were given as numbers and percentages. If the parameters&#xD;
      are parametrically distributed, continuous variables will be expressed as mean Â± standard&#xD;
      deviation; if the parameters are non-parametrically distributed, continuous variables will be&#xD;
      expressed as median (IQR). When parametric test assumptions will be provided, the&#xD;
      significance test of difference between two means and one-way analysis of variance will be&#xD;
      used to compare independent group differences. When parametric test assumptions were not&#xD;
      provided, Mann-Whitney U test will be used to compare independent group differences. The&#xD;
      relationships between continuous variables will be analyzed using Spearman correlation&#xD;
      analysis, chi-square test will be used for analyzing categorical variables. Furthermore,&#xD;
      Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was used for the discriminant&#xD;
      performance serum mannose levels under investigation. In addition, the relationships between&#xD;
      continuous variables will be examined by Spearman correlation analysis. P &lt;0.05 will be&#xD;
      considered statistically significant in all examinations.&#xD;
