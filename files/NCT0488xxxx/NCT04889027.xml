  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There are developments in the field of diagnosing children with a high risk of developmental&#xD;
      disorders such as cerebral palsy (CP), mental problems and autism spectrum disorder in&#xD;
      infancy. In particular, in infants experiencing the onset of extrauterine life in the&#xD;
      neonatal intensive care unit, the combination of neonatal neuroimaging along with the&#xD;
      assessment of general movements results in a highly accurate prediction of CP .&#xD;
&#xD;
      A clinical tool often used in predictions is a neurological examination. Various standard&#xD;
      variants are available, such as the Hammersmith Infant Neurological Examination (HINE),&#xD;
      Alberta Infant Motor Scale (AIMS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The neurological scale of SINDA is designed as a screening tool as follows: (1) in the first&#xD;
      year of life after the neonatal period, that is, in the corrected age range of 6 weeks to 12&#xD;
      months; (2) covers all infant neurological areas; (3) it is standardized, that is, it has a&#xD;
      set of items and criteria identical to that age range; (4) results in a score that is largely&#xD;
      independent of the baby's age; (5) general pediatricians are easy to use and take about 10&#xD;
      minutes to do (including recording scores); (6) contains a substantial part of items&#xD;
      assessing the quality of spontaneous movements; and (7) helps predict developmental outcome&#xD;

      Neurodevelopmental Assessment and to spread its use for evaluation in early rehabilitation in&#xD;

    <measure>Hammersmith Infant Neurological Examination (HINE)</measure>
    <time_frame>30-40 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>The HINE includes three sections, the Neurological Examination, the Development of Motor Functions and the State of Behaviour. The first section evaluates cranial nerve, posture, movements, tone and reflexes. These items are not age-dependent. The second section evaluates head control, sitting, voluntary grasping, rolling, crawling and walking. The third section evaluates state of consciousness, emotional state and social orientation.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Alberta Infant Motor Scale (AIMS).</measure>
    <time_frame>30-45 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>This scale is a norm-referenced observational tool designed for the evaluation of gross motor development in infants from birth to 18 months of age or the acquisition of independent walking. It consists of 58 items and four subscales: supine (9 items), prone (21 items), sitting (12 items) and standing (16 items), which are observed in postural alignment, antigravity movements and surface contact.</description>
