      In this study, patients with obstructive colon cancer will be divided into two groups; in the&#xD;
      control group, curative surgery will be performed within 2 weeks after successful SEMS&#xD;
      placement, and in the experimental group, 3 cycles of neoadjuvant chemotherapy will be&#xD;
      administered into patients who undergo successful SEMS placement and then curative surgery&#xD;
      will be performed after neoadjuvnat chemotherapy. After the surgery, adjuvant chemotherapy&#xD;
      will be administered, and total perioperative chemotherapy will be administered with 12&#xD;
      cycles. The primary end points is overall survival, also the short-term perioperative&#xD;
      outcomes and long-term oncological outcomes will be compared between the control and&#xD;
      experimental group. Random allocation will be carried out with the consent of patients and&#xD;
      their guardians after successful SEMS placement, and 204 patients will be distributed between&#xD;
      the two groups by 1:1.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      It is known that approximately 30-40% of colorectal cancer require emergency surgery. Of&#xD;
      these, the colonic obstruction accounts for 80% of situations requiring emergency treatment&#xD;
      and colon perforation appears in 20%. In patients with colorectal cancer patients who require&#xD;
      emergency surgery, there are higher postoperative complication rates, mortality rates, and&#xD;
      ostomy formation rate than those who do not. In aspect of oncologic outcomes, long-term&#xD;
      survival also appears to be worse in patients undergoing emergency surgery. Despite recent&#xD;
      active screening for colorectal cancer, some studies have reported that the proportion of&#xD;
      colorectal cancer obstruction and perforation requiring emergency surgery still occur as&#xD;
      before. However, research on treatments to reduce postoperative complications and to increase&#xD;
      long-term survival for patients with symptomatic colorectal cancer requiring emergency&#xD;
      surgery remains inadequate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Emergency surgery cannot be avoided when colorectal perforation occurs due to colorectal&#xD;
      cancer. Obstructive colorectal cancer has also traditionally been performed in emergency&#xD;
      surgery with colorectal resection and ostomy composition. However, with the development of&#xD;
      endoscopic equipment and technology, endoscopic stent (self-expandable metallic stent, SEMS)&#xD;
      insertion has been feasible for patients with obstructive colon cancer and many researches&#xD;
      about a bridge to surgery which means a surgery after adequate decompression and bowel lavage&#xD;
      using SEMS placement have been reported that a bridge to surgery can reduce postoperative&#xD;
      complications, stoma formation, and postoperative mortality in selective cases. Currently,&#xD;
      such studies recommend the use of SEMS to improve short-term postoperative outcomes. However&#xD;
      in aspect of long-term oncological outcomes, the results have not yet been established.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, patients with obstructive colon cancer will be divided into two groups; in the&#xD;
      control group, curative surgery will be performed within 2 weeks after successful SEMS&#xD;
      placement, and in the experimental group, 3 cycles of neoadjuvant chemotherapy will be&#xD;
      administered into patients who undergo successful SEMS placement and then curative surgery&#xD;
      will be performed after neoadjuvnat chemotherapy. After the surgery, adjuvant chemotherapy&#xD;
      will be administered, and total perioperative chemotherapy will be administered with 12&#xD;
      cycles. The primary end points is overall survival, also the short-term perioperative&#xD;
      outcomes and long-term oncological outcomes will be compared between the control and&#xD;
      experimental group. Random allocation will be carried out with the consent of patients and&#xD;
      their guardians after successful SEMS placement, and 204 patients will be distributed between&#xD;
      the two groups by 1:1. Through this study, we would like to identify that neoadjuvant&#xD;
      chemotherapy followed by curative resection after successful SEMS placement for obstructive&#xD;
      colon cancer can bring the improvement of short-term perioperative outcome and long-term&#xD;
      oncological outcome.&#xD;

After three cycles of FOLFOX, they will take a curative surgery. And then, after recovery period, adjuvant FOLFOX chemotherapy will be administered into them.
