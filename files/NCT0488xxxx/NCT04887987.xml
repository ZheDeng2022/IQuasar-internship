  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The present project aims to investigate the effects of lumbar strengthening training combined&#xD;
      with photobiomodulation therapy (PBMT) on functional and psychological aspects in young and&#xD;
      older adults with chronic non-specific low back pain. We hypothesized that lumbar&#xD;
      strengthening training combined with PBMT should promote greater improvement on functional&#xD;
      and psychological variables compared to strengthening training alone (placebo PBMT).&#xD;

      The purpose of this study will be to investigate the effects of lumbar strengthening training&#xD;
      combined with photobiomodulation therapy (PBMT) therapy by light-emitting diode (LED) on&#xD;
      functional and psychological aspects in young and older adults with chronic non-specific low&#xD;
      back pain. Initially, all participants will be submitted for a 2-wk familiarization period&#xD;
      with physical tests, and then randomized into two groups (N = 16/group): lumbar strengthening&#xD;
      training combined with LED PBMT (TR+LED) and lumbar strengthening training combined with&#xD;
      placebo PBMT (TR+PLA). Both groups will be submitted to a supervised 16-wk training program&#xD;
      (3 x/week) involving a specific lumbar extension exercise on the Roman bench and four&#xD;
      complementary exercises to improve core strength and spine stabilization. The groups will&#xD;
      receive their respective PBMT (LED or placebo) 30 minutes before each training session,&#xD;
      through a device containing 264 LEDs (132 LEDs of 660 nm and 132 LEDs of 850 nm), which will&#xD;
      be placed on the lumbar region (between L1 and L5) with the participants lying in the prone&#xD;
      position. The placebo LED will be applied with the device turned off. Participans will be&#xD;
      blinded to PBM treatments. The following variables will be assessed at pre and post-training:&#xD;
      anthropometric, body composition by bioimpedance, level of physical activity by International&#xD;
      Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ), maximal voluntary isometric contraction (MVIC) for&#xD;
      lumbar extension exercise, short physical performance battery (SPPB), postural balance on a&#xD;
      force platform, Schober test for lumbar spine flexion, Tampa Scale of kinesiophobia (TSK),&#xD;
      Fear Avoidance Beliefs Questionnaire (FABQ), pain catastrophizing scale (PCS), quality of&#xD;
      life by WHOQOL, oswestry disability index (ODI), Roland Morris disability questionnaire&#xD;
      (RMDQ), McGILL pain questionnaire, and visual analogue scale (VAS). Shapiro-Wilk and Levene&#xD;
      tests will be used to test the normality and homogeneity of the measurements, respectively.&#xD;
      Two-way ANOVA (group x time) tests for repeated measures will be performed to assess changes&#xD;
      over time and between groups for all dependent variables. Violation of sphericity will adjust&#xD;
      using Greenhouse-Geisser correction. The Bonferroni post-hoc test will detect specific&#xD;
      differences between groups. When appropriate, the percentage of change (∆%) will be reported&#xD;
      according to the following equation: ∆% = [(pre-average post average) / pre-average mean] ×&#xD;
      100. Values will be express as mean ± standard deviation. O significance level α will be&#xD;
      0.05.&#xD;
