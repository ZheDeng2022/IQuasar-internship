  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      COVID-19 infection produces thousands of hospital admissions in a very short period of time,&#xD;
      including critical care patients. It is expected that those who survive a severe spectrum of&#xD;
      the disease, will present some degree of health decline in the medium and long term, becoming&#xD;
      chronic patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post-intensive care syndrome (PICS) was described by the Society of Critical Care Medicine&#xD;
      (SCCM) as a new altered or worsening of physical, cognitive, or mental condition due to&#xD;
      critical illness and persisting after hospitalization, including pain. Also, clinical&#xD;
      features of infection include different types of pain, and if this pain persists, it can turn&#xD;
      into a chronic condition. Chronic pain is a currently recognized disease, but under-treated&#xD;
      in many cases, generating a significant deterioration in the quality of life of this patient.&#xD;
      It is vitally important to generate early care circuits to detect and treat those expected&#xD;
      complications, such as chronic pain in these patients. The objective of this study is to&#xD;
      estimate the level of persistent pain and its impact on health-related quality of life after&#xD;
      admission to an intensive care unit in patients who suffered this infection.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The presence of persistent pain and impaired quality of life in COVID19 patients who have&#xD;
      required intensive care can affect up to a total of 50% of patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main objective Estimate the level of persistent pain and health-related quality of life after&#xD;
      admission one in intensive care unit in COVID-19 patients, a new disease that has been&#xD;
      accompanied by great health, social and economic involvement from which we do not know the&#xD;
      long-term consequences in this patient cohort.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary goals&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Assessing patient's characteristics before ICU admissión; the prevalence of painkillers&#xD;
           use, including opioids, history of previous pain, and comorbidities. Find relationships&#xD;
           between these characteristics and the development of chronic pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine if some ICU treatments and patient's characteristics may contribute to&#xD;
           persistent pain in COVID-19 survivors ( number of prone therapies, thromboembolic&#xD;
           complications, and medication for sedate used)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine the quality of life using the SF-12 test.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine pain characteristics using the ID-PAIN test.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine the scale of anxiety and depression using the HADs test.&#xD;
