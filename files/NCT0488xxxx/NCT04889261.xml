  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Severe COVID-19 is associated with a hypercoagulable state, with a high risk of thrombotic&#xD;
      phenomena such as pulmonary thromboembolism (PE). Its diagnostic suspicion is complicated,&#xD;
      due to the overlap of symptoms of PE with those of COVID-19 itself. Therefore, it is&#xD;
      essential to improve PE prediction to optimise the performance of confirmatory imaging tests&#xD;
      such as thoracic CT angiography. Early diagnosis has relevant therapeutic implications, as it&#xD;
      justifies starting anticoagulant treatment early, with a possible positive impact on the&#xD;
      clinical evolution of these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The CHOD risk scale has recently been described: the acronym for C-reactive protein&#xD;
      concentration, heart rate, oxygen saturation, and D-Dimer levels. Its initial description was&#xD;
      carried out in a study in a single hospital centre. proving to be an easy-to-apply tool,&#xD;
      useful for predicting the appearance of PE in patients hospitalized for COVID-19.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this study is to carry out an external validation of this scale in patients&#xD;
      hospitalized for COVID-19 pneumonia, through an observational, cross-sectional, multicenter,&#xD;
      real-life study in patients hospitalized for severe COVID-19 pneumonia, confirmed by&#xD;
      objective methods, and showing high D-dimer values.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Imaging tests with CT angiography will be performed in patients with elevated D-Dimer,&#xD;
      following international clinical practice regulations. Given that they will be consecutive&#xD;
      patients, CT angiography will be performed in all patients regardless of the patient's&#xD;
      clinical probability of PE as long as they meet the inclusion criteria and none of the&#xD;
      exclusion criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To calculate the PE predictive power of the CHOD scale in the validation cohort, a&#xD;
      methodology similar to that used in the construction cohort will be used, that is, the use of&#xD;
      a ROC curve.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Taking into account that a similar predictive value (with a maximum error of 5%) between the&#xD;
      CHOD scale in the construction cohort and that of this study (validation cohort) will be&#xD;
      considered as an adequate external validation, and taking into account a statistical power of&#xD;
      80%, an alpha error of 5% and a maximum loss of patients of 15%, the required sample size is&#xD;
      245 patients. Since 7 centres initially participate, each of which will have to contribute 35&#xD;
      valid consecutive patients for the analysis.&#xD;

The scale ranges from 0 to 7 points.

        Consecutive patients hospitalized for pneumonia caused by SARS-CoV-2 confirmed by objective&#xD;
        methods, and with elevated D-dimer values.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Since it is a prevalence and validation study, pulmonary artery CT angiography will be&#xD;
        performed consecutively in all patients (regardless of the pre-test clinical probability of&#xD;
        PE that they present) who meet the criteria defined in the construction study of the CHOD&#xD;
        risk scale, and that are managed by the group of participating physicians. The random&#xD;
        assignment of admitted patients by the inpatient department manager to participating&#xD;
        physicians ensures that the sample is representative of the admissions set, which will then&#xD;
        allow inferences to be established without the need to establish a priori randomization&#xD;
        that would imply ethical aspects.&#xD;
