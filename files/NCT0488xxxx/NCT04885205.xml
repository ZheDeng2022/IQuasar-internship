  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sleep disturbances have been shown to contribute to poorer recovery from a concussion.&#xD;
      Furthermore, sleep disturbances have been associated with more frequent and severe&#xD;
      post-concussion symptoms including headache, vertigo, anxiety, depression, and decreased&#xD;
      short term memory reducing quality of life and productivity at work or school. Additionally,&#xD;
      recent research indicates that individuals with a concussion who have poor sleep quality have&#xD;
      increased levels of Neurofilament light (NfL) and tau biomarkers indicating that there may&#xD;
      still be axonal damage after weeks or months after the initial concussion injury.&#xD;
      Post-concussion symptoms have been associated with higher levels of these biomarkers and&#xD;
      there has been a report of higher levels of NfL and tau years following a concussion event.&#xD;
      Cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) is an effective treatment for insomnia yet&#xD;
      it remains unclear if this treatment method is effective in improving sleep outcomes,&#xD;
      reducing concomitant post-concussion symptoms, and biomarkers of neural injury/risk in&#xD;
      individuals post- concussion. The central hypothesis for this project is treating sleep&#xD;
      disturbances will yield a clinically relevant reduction in concomitant post-concussion&#xD;
      symptoms. The objective for the proposed study is to determine if CBT-I will reduce insomnia&#xD;
      symptoms and improve concomitant post-concussion symptoms in individuals after concussion and&#xD;
      if symptom improvements are maintained at 6-weeks and 12-weeks after CBT-I intervention.&#xD;

    <time_frame>baseline to 21 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Severity of 22 concussion-related symptoms are assessed by a Likert scale 0-6. Participants will rate their symptoms from a &quot;0&quot; or no symptom to &quot;6&quot; extreme symptom. A score of 132 is the maximum someone can have indicating all symptoms are severe. 2. The number of post-concussion symptoms will be assessed by counting the number of symptoms that the participant identified as having a severity of &quot;1&quot; or higher on the PCSS. A score of a &quot;1&quot; indicates that the symptom is mild, but still noticeable.</description>

After re-assessment 1, participants in the CBT-I Initial Group will continue with typical activities while the WL group will receive the CBT-I intervention. After re-assessment 2, both groups continue typical activities. All participants will complete a third re-assessment 21 weeks after starting the study.</description>
