      The investigators developed the service showing patient health record altogether which is&#xD;
      managed by each hospital separately and recording the patient health information based on&#xD;
      mobile application. This study is a multi-centered study involving two hospitals, providing&#xD;
      services to patients, care givers and medical staffs. After the participants use this&#xD;
      service, the investigators evaluate the effectiveness and satisfaction of this service&#xD;
      through questionnaires and in-depth interviews.&#xD;

      &lt;Background&gt; Emergency situations for chronic patients are increasing due to aging, eating&#xD;
      habits and lifestyle changes. For chronic patients, comprehensive health records and&#xD;
      utilization are important for health care and emergency situations. In particular, in the&#xD;
      event of an emergency, information on the patient's personal health records, such as recent&#xD;
      surgery records, disease history, prescription and dosage history is needed immediately, but&#xD;
      it is difficult to check separately for each hospital. In addition, in emergencies, it may&#xD;
      take more time for proper treatment to take place if patients themselves cannot directly talk&#xD;
      about their medication or past surgical history, or if they are unable to communicate with&#xD;
      patients. Recently, conditions have been prepared for the collection and utilization of&#xD;
      personal health record information due to changes in policy and technology environment,&#xD;
      making it possible to provide services for emergency patients with chronic diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      &lt;Objective&gt; To establish a service for collection and utilization of medical records (care,&#xD;
      examination, surgery, prescription records) and PGHD for chronic patients and to evaluate its&#xD;
      effectiveness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      &lt;Design&gt; Mixed methods study (questionnaires and interview)&#xD;
&#xD;
      &lt;Setting&gt; At the Samsung Medical Center and the Dong-A Medical Center.&#xD;
&#xD;
      &lt;Enrollment&gt; 400 patients(care givers)&#xD;
&#xD;
      &lt;Intervention&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. 400 patients(care givers) are enrolled and use the personal health wallet service.&#xD;
           (Personal Health Record service)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The participants fill out questionnaire to evaluate the service&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Some of them are invited for an in-depth interview.&#xD;
