  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Following informed consent and screening, eligible subjects with moderate to severe&#xD;
      nasolabial folds will be randomized to receive saypha® VOLUME Lidocaine from 1 of 2&#xD;
      manufacturing sites. The device will be injected into the deep dermis or supraperiostal, and&#xD;
      subjects will return for follow-up assessments at Week 2, 4, 24, 36, 52 and optional at Week&#xD;
      65, 78 and 104 after the treatment. A Touch-up treatment may be done at Week 2, if deemed&#xD;
      appropriate by the investigator. The performance of the investigational device will be&#xD;
      evaluated by the investigator by assessing severity of nasolabial folds using the Nasolabial&#xD;
      Folds Severity Rating Scale (NLF-SRS) at Week 4, 24, 36, 52 after the treatment and optional&#xD;
      at Week 65, 78 and 104 and in comparison to Day 0. Telephone visits will be performed&#xD;
      approximately 24 hours post-administration to monitor possible adverse events. In case any&#xD;
      adverse events are reported during the telephone visits an unscheduled visit should be&#xD;
      performed.&#xD;
