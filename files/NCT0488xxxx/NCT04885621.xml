      This pilot study will involve intensive training in self-management of diabetes mellitus. The&#xD;
      intensive diabetes self-management program will involve an initial diabetes assessment with&#xD;
      the nurse/diabetes educator, an initial evaluation by the Endocrinologist, Dr. Santen, at one&#xD;
      of the Tri-Area CHC clinics; weekly or bi-weekly phone calls to review glucose and insulin&#xD;
      data and 3-month, 4.5 month and 6-month follow-ups on telemedicine with Dr. Santen. A cloud&#xD;
      based glucose monitoring system will utilize the Verizon based Telcare glucose meter with&#xD;
      glucose test strips and the Glucommander-outpatientR algorithm to make insulin dosage&#xD;
      recommendations. The goal will be to test blood glucose 4-7 times/day. The serial glucose&#xD;
      levels are accessible on the meter itself but also can be accessed online by the entire&#xD;
      diabetes team. Weekly to four weekly phone calls with the UVA endocrinologist ( and&#xD;
      nurse/diabetes educator from Tri-Area as necessary) will be completed to discuss glucose&#xD;
      patterns and make insulin adjustments. In addition, the patient will attend four diabetes&#xD;
      tele-education programs to learn more about improved self-management of their diabetes. To&#xD;
      facilitate nutritional education, a modified , patient specific, Nutrisystem R diet will be&#xD;
      supplied , designed to be the exclusive source of nutrition. This diet will involve 1200&#xD;
      calories for women and 1800 calories for men. Both frozen and non-frozen food will be&#xD;
      delivered to the patient. Nutrisystems will supply these &quot; meal replacements&quot; at a reduced&#xD;
      cost based on this pilot program.&#xD;

      Introduction: Greater use of technology will allow patients with diabetes on insulin therapy&#xD;
      to optimize their glucose levels, limit input from health care providers, and thus markedly&#xD;
      reduce costs incurred by health care professional fees. A key component required to implement&#xD;
      training in use of this technology is an intensive program of self-management which utilizes&#xD;
      automated, cloud-based glucose data transfer and storage along with analysis and algorithm&#xD;
      and endocrinologist based treatment recommendations. The hypothesis to be tested in this&#xD;
      study is to demonstrate that inclusion of the technology based approach rather than standard&#xD;
      of care will statistically significantly improve primary and secondary endpoints. A simple,&#xD;
      technological approach is most suited to underserved populations where medical resources for&#xD;
      patients with diabetes are scarce. A successful study will enhance the rationale for using&#xD;
      Cloud-based meter and analysis systems.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background: Diabetes mellitus is a very common disease with 22.3 million affected in the&#xD;
      United states and with estimated annual costs of $245 billion(1). About 18 million people die&#xD;
      every year from cardiovascular disease, for which diabetes and hypertension are major&#xD;
      predisposing factors. The prevalence of diabetes in the USA is estimated to increase from&#xD;
      7.4% in 2014 to 12% in 2025. The increase is driven primarily by the increase in obesity&#xD;
      .This is not exclusively a USA problem as globally the number of patients with diabetes will&#xD;
      increase to 380 million from 246 million in 2007.(2) Much of this increase is attributable to&#xD;
      the increase in obesity both globally and in the United States specifically (2) .&#xD;
&#xD;
      The American Diabetes Association recommends referral to an endocrinologist when patients do&#xD;
      not achieve the desired goals of treatment, namely a HbA1C at or below 7.0% (3) However, in&#xD;
      the standard care arm of the DCCT, the median Hb A1C documented during conventional treatment&#xD;
      was 8.9% and only 12% of patients were at or below 7%.(ref).These data suggest that a large&#xD;
      fraction of patients with diabetes should be referred to an endocrinologist for advice and/or&#xD;
      management. However, workforce data report that only 15% % of patients with diabetes at&#xD;
      present are evaluated by endocrinologists(4). Part of the reason is the gap in workforce&#xD;
      numbers of Endocrinologists in the USA. There are the 5496 board certified adult&#xD;
      endocrinologists in the USA currently(4) with an estimated gap of 1500 endocrinologists in&#xD;
      2014 .This gap which is estimated to grow to 2700 by 2025 unless more endocrinologists are&#xD;
      trained. Diabetes. As diabetes care represents 46.1% of the coded visits of&#xD;
      Endocrinologists(4) and there is a substantial workforce gap, it is obvious why involvement&#xD;
      by endocrinologists is limited.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The data described above reveals that new approaches are needed to improve the care of&#xD;
      patients with diabetes. This is perhaps more relevant for patients living in rural,&#xD;
      undeserved areas where access to specialists, primary care teams focused on management of&#xD;
      diabetes, and primary care providers is limited by professional, geographical and financial&#xD;
      considerations(5) (ref) .&#xD;
&#xD;
      A proposed solution to the rural access problem is the use of telehealth and telemedicine.&#xD;
      Telehealth is defined as access to providers and educational resources by video, smartphone,&#xD;
      computer, telephone, cloud based glucose meters, text messaging and other means of rapid&#xD;
      communication. Telemedicine specifically refers to patient encounters with providers via real&#xD;
      time television interactions . These methodologies can alleviate the access problems due to&#xD;
      geography, the availability of endocrinologists, and the cost of specific clinic visits.&#xD;
      Pilot data from the Kaiser Permanente Health care system suggest that 90% of encounters with&#xD;
      patients with diabetes can be replaced via telehealth methodology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Even with use of telehealth technology, the number of providers, endocrinologists ,&#xD;
      educators, and members of multi-disciplinary teams with a diabetes focus are limited. A&#xD;
      solution to this problem, is to teach the patient self-management. It is hypothesized that an&#xD;
      intensive, 6 month, educational program in self-management will markedly reduce the need for&#xD;
      health care providers and endocrinologists long term and will result in improved glucose&#xD;
      control and a reduction is complications related to poor control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Published data on the ability to improve glucose control with use of telehealth have been&#xD;
      both positive and negative(3;6;7;8;9-12;13-17;17-25) and the conclusions regarding clinical&#xD;
      utility controversial. However, a recent meta-analysis identified the key features necessary&#xD;
      for statistically significant improvement in HbA1C level and other parameters. The greater&#xD;
      the number of the seven key components implemented, the greater the success in lowering&#xD;
      HbA1C. The 7 key elements include (1) Patient education (2) provider education (3) structured&#xD;
      SMBG-self monitoring blood glucose (4) the establishment of specific SMBG goals (5) diet and&#xD;
      exercise data feedback (6) glucose data used to modify treatment (7) interactive&#xD;
      communication or shared decision making. Each of these components will be built into the&#xD;
      proposed study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The overall goal of this study will be to demonstrate that a 6 month, intensive&#xD;
      self-management program using telehealth methodology will result in long term improvement of&#xD;
      glucose control and ultimately, in rate of complications this will involve. Several barriers&#xD;
      to achievement of these goals, based on published data, are anticipated which influenced&#xD;
      protocol design. These include: lack of a home computer or smartphone; lack of knowledge, use&#xD;
      and /or training regarding computers, cost of glucose test strips, problems with&#xD;
      reimbursement , problems with communication with electronic medical records , and , effective&#xD;
      rapid feedback mechanisms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our Preliminary data: The Telcare meter, cloud based glucose monitoring system has been beta&#xD;
      tested by the project team and selected for use. Initially, the availability of several&#xD;
      smartphone, Bluetooth-based electronic data transfer systems were evaluated and rejected on&#xD;
      the basis of complexity. Later the Livongo system was evaluated and I t was found that the&#xD;
      provider T-moble had limited to no coverage in the area served by the patient population (&#xD;
      i.e. patients served by the Tri-Area and Bland County Community Health systems. A&#xD;
      geographical drive through survey of the area revealed that the Verizon signal, assessed on a&#xD;
      Samsung Smartphone, appeared to have adequate signal. Two nurses then utilized the Verizon&#xD;
      based Telcare system and documented its utility in the clinic and catchment areas. Finally a&#xD;
      test patient has utilized the Telcare system for 2 months with use of the 7, 14, 21, and 30&#xD;
      day record software and demonstrated ease of use, transmission of data to EPIC (The EMR used&#xD;
      by the university of Virginia-UVA) and feedback adjustment of insulin doses. On these bases,&#xD;
      the Telcare system has been chosen for utilization. The glucommander -outpatient algorithm is&#xD;
      directly linked to the Telcare dashboard and will make recommendations about adjustment of&#xD;
      insulin doses. The dose changes will be overseen by the endocrinologist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The diabetes tele- educational segment of this project has been developed and conducted by&#xD;
      the Virginia Center for Diabetes Prevention and Education (VCDPE) at UVA over the past ten&#xD;
      years as part of a State of Virginia funded project. As detailed in the appendix, this&#xD;
      consists of educational classes delivered to rural sites ( Federally Qualified Health Center&#xD;
      and local health departments) via-teleconferencing with components of didactic material&#xD;
      presentations and question and answer periods. These diabetes tele-educational classes will&#xD;
      be used with minor modification in this project.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Unique nature of program: This program is designed to meet a unique need of patients in&#xD;
      underserved areas where there is no access to Endocrinologist, Certified Diabetes Educators,&#xD;
      or sufficient number of health care providers to meet the needs of the increasing number of&#xD;
      patients with diabetes. Use of cloud based-glucose monitoring and telemedicine will prove an&#xD;
      efficient means of managing patients at reduced cost and greater impact Rationale: There are&#xD;
      an insufficient number of Endocrinologists Certified Diabetes Educators, and sufficiently&#xD;
      trained health care providers to facilitate excellent glucose control in patients with&#xD;
      insulin requiring diabetes mellitus in rural areas. A key solution to this problem is to&#xD;
      intensively educate patients in diabetes self-management in order for them to manage their&#xD;
      own disease with markedly reduced professional input. Greater self-management will thus&#xD;
      reduce requirements for health care provider input and overall costs long term. Patients with&#xD;
      diabetes in underserved areas have limited access to health care providers and would benefit&#xD;
      from an intensive, diabetes self-management program based on practical, easy to use,&#xD;
      cloud-based internet technology with Endocrinologist -driven therapeutic recommendations&#xD;
      combined with diabetes tele-education.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: This study is based on the hypothesis that automatic recording and cloud-based&#xD;
      data transfer and analysis of glucose data with peer based monitoring will markedly enhance&#xD;
      compliance and improve glucose control. Manual rather than automatic recording of glucose&#xD;
      logs and submission to health care providers is associated with poor compliance and thus&#xD;
      inferior outcomes. Finally an intensive program of education in self- management will result&#xD;
      in better long term glucose control and reduction of complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Elimination/amelioration of published barriers: Several steps will be taken to ameliorate the&#xD;
      published barriers describe above. Patients will be provided with Telcare meters and glucose&#xD;
      test strips. These meters uplink glucose data automatically to the cloud via Verizon and&#xD;
      eliminate the need for smartphones and home computers. Use of the University of Virginia&#xD;
      Telemedicine Office and telephone dictation capability will allow clinical and lab data to be&#xD;
      entered into the EPIC electronic medical record. Weekly or fortnightly telephone and&#xD;
      telemedicine encounters will be utilized for rapid feedback. The Federally funded Community&#xD;
      Heath Center programs will assist with financial difficulties.&#xD;

      Description of Study&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study sites:&#xD;
&#xD;
      • Federally Funded Community Health Centers programs -Tri-Area Community Health Center (&#xD;
      Laurel Fork, Floyd, and Ferrum)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Technology Components: Several aspects of technology will facilitate success of this program.&#xD;
      These include&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Internet based glucose monitoring program utilizing the Telcare meter, glucose strips,&#xD;
           online data processing, and glucommander-outpatient dashboard capability.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Telemedicine consultation visits with Endocrinologist from UVA with assistance from an&#xD;
           onsite Nurse/Diabetes educator who will be with the patient&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Tele- educational sessions&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Vimeo based program description and introduction&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Dex Com continuous glucose monitor ( one week use for baseline information)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Technology Training: Each patient will be evaluated on site by Dr. Richard Santen, the study&#xD;
      endocrinologist and at that time, he will supervise certain educational elements with onsite&#xD;
      nurse/diabetes educator and patient . These will include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Instruction in using the Jabber program to maintain HIPPA confidentiality&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Demonstrate use of the Video Interface&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Viewing of a Vimeo movie describing the full program and all of its elements. Diet: The&#xD;
           concept of &quot;meal replacements&quot; for the improvement of the glucose control of patients&#xD;
           with diabetes mellitus has been studied previously but never applied to populations of&#xD;
           patients in underserved, rural areas. The nutrisystem plan D provides a balanced,&#xD;
           diabetic diet with 1800 calories for men and 1200 for women. Both frozen and non-frozen&#xD;
           components are shipped each week. A counselor from Nutrisystems is available for&#xD;
           coaching and instruction in use of the diet. The PI of this pilot project has beta&#xD;
           tested the system and found it to be user friendly and exceedingly well designed with&#xD;
           color coding and provision of low calorie, hunger reducing snacks.&#xD;
