    <textblock>
      This is a phase I/II dose-escalation study of 225Ac-J591 administered together with&#xD;
      177Lu-PSMA-I&amp;T (also known as PNT2002). The two study drugs are 225Ac-J591 and&#xD;
      177Lu-PSMA-I&amp;T. Both drugs are designed to deliver radiation to prostate cancer cells; they&#xD;
      are known as radionuclide conjugates (radiation linked to antibodies/molecules that recognize&#xD;
      prostate cancer cells). The first phase of the study (phase I) will determine the highest&#xD;
      dose of the study drug that can be safely given. The second phase of the study (phase II)&#xD;
      will determine the effectiveness of the drug combination in patients with prostate cancer.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This clinical trial is for men with progressive metastatic castration-resistant prostate&#xD;
      cancer (mCRPC). The two primary objectives of this trial are to determine the highest dose of&#xD;
      225Ac-J591 and 177Lu-PSMA-I&amp;T that can be administered together (also known as maximum&#xD;
      tolerated dose) and to determine the effectiveness of the drug combination. Patients who&#xD;
      choose to participate in this study will have a screening visit to determine whether or not&#xD;
      they are eligible for the study. The phase I component is a 3+3 dose-escalation design, with&#xD;
      maximum two cohorts. 177Lu-PSMA-I&amp;T will be given at a fixed dose of 6.8 GBq. 225Ac-J591 will&#xD;
      be given starting at 30 KBq/kg, with a subsequent dose-escalation by an increment of 10&#xD;
      KBq/kg to 40 KBq/kg. The two drugs will be co-administered every 8 weeks, for 2 cycles. Once&#xD;
      the maximum tolerated dose has been established, the phase II component will enroll up to 24&#xD;
      patients. The primary efficacy measure will be proportion of patients with PSA decline and&#xD;
      proportion of patients with 50%+ PSA decline. Other objectives include to determine the&#xD;
      radiographic response rate, biochemical progression-free survival, and overall survival.&#xD;
      During the study, patients will be closely monitored for adverse events (side effects);&#xD;
      weekly x4 weeks, then every 2 weeks until completion of therapy, then every 4 weeks until&#xD;
      patients start another therapy. Long-term follow-up will be every 6 months, for 3 years.&#xD;
      During the phase I component, the adverse event assessment phase will be a minimum of 8 weeks&#xD;
      after the last dose of 225Ac-J591 and 177Lu-PSMA-I&amp;T. At screening, week 12, and week 24,&#xD;
      patients will undergo imaging. Imaging will include 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT. 68Ga-PSMA-11 is&#xD;
      comprised of gallium-68, a radiotracer, linked to PSMA-11, a molecule that binds to PSMA.&#xD;
      Patients with PSMA-positive tumors are eligible for the study. Additional imaging includes&#xD;
      SPECT imaging on day 8 of each cycle, to evaluate radiation uptake into the tumors.&#xD;
