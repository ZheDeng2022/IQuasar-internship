      Pro-ocular™ 1% topical gel his demonstrated efficacy in rapidly reducing or eliminating dry&#xD;
      eye symptoms, and after multiple doses, the signs and symptoms of ocular surface disease&#xD;
      including dry eye disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study DE-2 is single center, randomized, double-masked, placebo-controlled, parallel-group&#xD;
      study designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of 1% Pro-ocular topical gel administered&#xD;
      twice daily for 12 weeks for treatment of Dry Eye Disease. The approximately 80 subjects will&#xD;
      be randomized 1:1, active drug:placebo.&#xD;
