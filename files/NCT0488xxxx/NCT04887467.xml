  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This monocentric and prospective trial aims firstly to assess the pharmacokinetic profile of&#xD;
      continuous and diurnal subcutaneous apomorphine infusion in patients with Parkinson's disease&#xD;
      under stabilized treatment and, secondly, to collect data highlighting the possible influence&#xD;
      of pharmacogenetics.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A screening visit will be conducted 15 days to 2 months prior to the patient's&#xD;
      hospitalization. Each subject will undergo a clinical examination including a collection of&#xD;
      data relating to medical and surgical history, specific data related to Parkinson's disease&#xD;
      and apomorphine pump treatment, and the completion of all items of the Movement Disorder&#xD;
      Society - Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS) 3 scale in ON condition.&#xD;
      Verification of the biological parameters necessary for the proper conduct of a&#xD;
      pharmacokinetic study will also be carried out (venous capital; search for possible hepatic&#xD;
      and/or renal failure).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The subjects will be called to the hospital two by two at 4:00 pm for a medical visit, during&#xD;
      which a clinical examination will be performed (height, weight, fat mass, occurrence of&#xD;
      infectious and/or inflammatory episodes) The subjects will then be placed in a room. A&#xD;
      catheter will be placed in a forearm vein to allow blood sampling. All plasma samples will be&#xD;
      taken from subjects who have been supine for at least 30 minutes. Blood pressure and heart&#xD;
      rate will be checked before each sample.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A first blood sample will be taken at 8 pm followed by a standardized dinner. After the pump&#xD;
      is stopped and removed at the patient's usual time, consecutive blood samples will be taken&#xD;
      at T30, T60, T120, and T180 (i.e., 30 min, 1 h, 2 h, and 3 h after pump removal). The next&#xD;
      morning, a new blood sample will be taken 10 min before the pump is turned on, at the usual&#xD;
      time. A standardized breakfast will be served. A new series of consecutive blood samples will&#xD;
      be taken at T30, T60, T120 and T180, following the same pattern as before.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A standardized lunch will be served around 11:30 am, and the patients will be allowed to&#xD;
      leave after medical advice, at the latest at 2 pm.&#xD;
