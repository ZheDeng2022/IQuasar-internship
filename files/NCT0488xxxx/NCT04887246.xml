  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There are relevant questions that need to be answered about the effectiveness and safety of&#xD;
      COVID-19 vaccines. The objective of this observational study is to follow up the clinical&#xD;
      outcomes after vaccination in all the headquarters of the National University of Colombia. It&#xD;
      is a project that is considered institutional importance and is part of the actions that the&#xD;
      National University of Colombia has proposed to the national government to accompany the&#xD;
      national vaccination program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed follow-up includes the sociodemographic, cultural, clinical and pharmacological&#xD;
      characterization of the vaccinated population, including the report of adverse events&#xD;
      occurring after the vaccination process, the behavior of the population after the&#xD;
      administration of the vaccine, monitoring serological outcomes, identification of medication&#xD;
      errors and therapeutic failure. Three stages are proposed in which the population affiliated&#xD;
      to UNISALUD is gradually included, then the beneficiaries and later the student community and&#xD;
      their families.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The scope of the attached protocol includes Stage I, which corresponds to teachers and&#xD;
      administrative staff (active and retired) linked to UNISALUD.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the clinical outcomes and adverse events associated with immunization&#xD;
      (ESAVI) of vaccines against COVID-19 in the cohort of the university community, affiliates&#xD;
      and beneficiaries of UNISALUD and students of the National University of Colombia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODOLOGY: Descriptive longitudinal, prospective and observational study. Follow-up to a&#xD;
      cohort without a control group. Modular multi-center stage study. The development of the&#xD;
      research is proposed through a modular, multicenter and staged study. For the first phase,&#xD;
      all employees of the National University of Colombia (active and retired) who agree to&#xD;
      participate in the study will be monitored. The second phase includes monitoring the&#xD;
      beneficiaries of UNISALUD affiliates and the third phase includes students and their&#xD;
      families. For the calculation of the sample size in phase III, it will be carried out by&#xD;
      applying formulas for descriptive studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up Time: It is estimated to be one year from the date of the first dose of the&#xD;
      vaccine. A second phase is expected to follow up the outcomes for another additional year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection: It will begin with the presentation of the informed consent for the&#xD;
      presentation of the study. Subsequently, a periodic follow-up will be carried out via&#xD;
      telephone or email to identify and complete the established sociodemographic, cultural,&#xD;
      clinical and pharmacological variables.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Serological Follow-up: The humoral immune response and its duration will be analyzed through&#xD;
      serological tests with a blood sample to a sample of the study population. Serological&#xD;
      follow-up will be carried out in 3 moments: prior to vaccination, after the first dose of the&#xD;
      vaccine, and at the end of the study. The collected samples will be taken to the Laboratory&#xD;
      of the Faculty of Medicine of the National University of Colombia for their separation.&#xD;
      Antibody analysis will be done by chemiluminescence using the Advia Centaur COV2 platform&#xD;
      from Siemens (3).&#xD;
&#xD;
      ETHICAL ASPECTS: This research is considered a research with minimal risk (Resolution No.&#xD;
      008430 of October 4, 1993 in article 11 of Colombia's Ministry of Healt ). When handling very&#xD;
      sensitive information, the informed consent of the user and / or his manager will be filled&#xD;
      out, prior to the start of the application of the data collection instrument, and the&#xD;
      collection of blood samples for serological monitoring.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Access to the clinical and pharmacological information of the participants affiliated and&#xD;
      beneficiaries of UNISALUD will be required, which will be provided by the same entity, as&#xD;
      well as the databases adjusted to the vaccination phases in Colombia. In the case of&#xD;
      students, basic contact information and financial situation will be needed, which will be&#xD;
      reported by the University Welfare Directorate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The treatment of information and data collected in accordance with Law 1266 of 2008 &quot;Habeas&#xD;
      Data&quot; and subject to acceptance by the participants through informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study protocol has the endorsement of the ethics committee of the Faculty of Sciences in&#xD;
      a meeting held on March 1, 2021 (Minutes 02-2021).&#xD;
