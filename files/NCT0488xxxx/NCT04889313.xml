  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A growing number of studies highlight the persistence of symptoms after the acute phase of&#xD;
      SARS-CoV-2 infection, including in outpatients with mild to moderate forms of the disease.&#xD;
      More than 80% of patients with persistent post-COVID-19 symptoms reported neurologic and&#xD;
      neurocognitive disturbances. The pathophysiological mechanism is currently unknown, and&#xD;
      several hypotheses have been put forward. Involvement of a Somatic Symptom Disorder (SSD) is&#xD;
      plausible given the similarity of these symptoms with the Chronic Fatigue Syndrome identified&#xD;
      as a SSD subtype. The objective of the SOMATiC study (SOMAtic symptom disorders Triggered by&#xD;
      COVID-19) is to determine whether a positive diagnosis of SSD can be asserted in patients&#xD;
      with persistent post-COVID-19 neurological symptoms.&#xD;

      A growing number of studies highlight the persistence of symptoms after the acute phase of&#xD;
      SARS-CoV-2 infection, including in outpatients with mild to moderate forms of the disease.&#xD;
      More than 80% of patients with persistent post-COVID-19 symptoms reported neurologic and&#xD;
      neurocognitive disturbances. The pathophysiological mechanism is currently unknown, and&#xD;
      several hypotheses have been put forward. Involvement of a Somatic Symptom Disorder (SSD) is&#xD;
      plausible given the similarity of these symptoms with the Chronic Fatigue Syndrome identified&#xD;
      as a SSD subtype. The objective of the SOMATiC study (SOMAtic symptom disorders Triggered by&#xD;
      COVID-19) is to determine whether a positive diagnosis of SSD can be asserted in patients&#xD;
      with persistent post-COVID-19 neurological symptoms. The study includes consecutive patients&#xD;
      referred for neurology consultation because of chronic neurologic symptoms after the acute&#xD;
      phase of COVID-19. Data are collected with medical record and by phone interview. It&#xD;
      consisted of a semi-structured interview followed by hetero-assessed scales. A positive&#xD;
      diagnosis of SSD was established with all the following criteria: a PHQ15 score greater than&#xD;
      or equal to 12 (criterion A); an SSD12 score greater than or equal to 23 (criterion B); an&#xD;
      evolution of symptoms greater than or equal to four weeks for criterion C. To complete the&#xD;
      DSMV criteria, the investigators assessed the presence of indirect argument in favor of SSD&#xD;
      diagnosis : a traumatic experience of the initial episode collected during the interview,&#xD;
      post-traumatic stress disorder measured by the IES-R scale, a psychiatric history collected&#xD;
      during the interview, significant alexithymia measured by the TAS 20 scale, traits of&#xD;
      pronounced perfectionism with the scale adapted by Cox et al. from HF MPS, chronic fatigue&#xD;
      syndrome as described after viral infections with the SOFA scale, functional disorders prior&#xD;
      to infection with SARS-CoV-2, a former and/or current medical nomadism, a significant&#xD;
      consumption of care. The quality of life is measured by the WHOQOL-BREF scale, anxious and/or&#xD;
      depressive symptoms measured by the HAD scale, and sleep disorders assessed by the ISI scale&#xD;
      .&#xD;
