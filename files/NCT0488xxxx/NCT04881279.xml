  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      On April 9, 2017, Erie County Medical Center, Western New York's sole level I trauma center&#xD;
      was under cyberattack. The perpetrators utilized ransomware that gained access to the&#xD;
      hospital's web server and encrypted hospital data, forcing a system-wide downtime for nearly&#xD;
      2 months. Electronic medical records, imaging, and interdepartmental communication were&#xD;
      severely affected, forcing the hospital to temporarily return to pre-EMR era operations. We&#xD;
      examined the impact of this cyber disaster on the outcomes of trauma care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Retrospective review of de-identified hospital emergency room and trauma registry data and&#xD;
      operating room case logs from April 9th through June 9th, 2016, 2017, and 2018. Baseline&#xD;
      characteristics of study cohort for each period will be examined using the chi-square test&#xD;
      for categorical variables and the Student's t-test for continuous variables that are normally&#xD;
      distributed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This was an exempt study in our institution.&#xD;
