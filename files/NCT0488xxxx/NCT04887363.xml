  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Core muscles and core stability has a key component in the postural control or balance.&#xD;
      However, no clear evidence has been found for the positive relationship between core&#xD;
      stability and postural control in the elderly, and the effects of core stabilizing training&#xD;
      on postural control or balance in the elderly. The purposes of this project are to&#xD;
      investigate the effects of core stability training program on muscle strength, muscle&#xD;
      performance, and balance outcomes in elderly adults.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this pretest, posttest design study, elderly adults enrolled and assigned to the core&#xD;
      exercise group or Tai Chi exercise group, the core exercise group received core exercise&#xD;
      intervention comparing to Tai Chi exercise group participated Tai chi exercise program as a&#xD;
      control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The young adults group were also enrolled for a reference group, not received any exercise&#xD;
      intervention and just only received the measurements once.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants in the two elderly group will receive 12-week, 36-session exercise-based core&#xD;
      stability training class. The each 60 minutes core exercise class focuses on exercise for&#xD;
      improving strength, endurance of core muscles and trunk stability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants need complete baseline assessments of muscle performance, and balance ability&#xD;
      measures 1 week prior and 1 week and 12 weeks following the intervention.&#xD;
