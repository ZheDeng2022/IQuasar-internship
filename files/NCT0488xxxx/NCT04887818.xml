    <textblock>
      Anal fissure is a common anorectal diseases characterized by tear of the anoderm from the&#xD;
      dentate line to the anal verge leading to pain and bleeding during and post defecation. It&#xD;
      may be a benign disease, but patients suffering from disease report significantly impacted&#xD;
      quality of life especially when it becomes chronic. Several treatment modalities have been&#xD;
      studied for chronic anal fissure, and topical calcium channel blockers (CCB) showed promising&#xD;
      benefit and side effect profile in treatment of chronic anal fissure. Topical Diltiazem and&#xD;
      Nifedipine are currently widely used CCBs for chronic anal fissure after multiple studies&#xD;
      showing their benefits compared to different agents or modalities. To the investigators'&#xD;
      knowledge, there is no study comparing the efficacy of topical Diltiazem and Nifedipine&#xD;
      directly. The investigators aim to design a pragmatic randomized clinical trial to compare&#xD;
      the efficacy, and side effect profile of topical Nifedipine and Diltiazem in treatment of&#xD;
      chronic anal fissure.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Anal fissure is a common anorectal diseases characterized by tear of the anoderm from the&#xD;
      dentate line to the anal verge. It is a benign disease, but symptoms including stabbing pain&#xD;
      during and post defecation, bleeding, and irritation lead to decreased quality of life. Acute&#xD;
      anal fissure are superficial splits, and mostly heal spontaneously within 4 weeks with or&#xD;
      without conservative management including high fibre diet and stool softeners. Chronic anal&#xD;
      fissure is characterized by symptoms lasting longer than 2 months, and clinical findings of&#xD;
      sentinel perianal skin tag, hypertrophied anal papilla, exposure of the underlying internal&#xD;
      anal sphincter or anal cicatrization. The pathophysiology involves hypertonia of the internal&#xD;
      anal sphincter leading to a reduction in mucosal blood flow, therefore poor healing tendency.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several treatment modalities have been studied for chronic anal fissure. Surgical therapy&#xD;
      (ie. lateral internal sphincterotomy) has shown promising healing rate, but its role as first&#xD;
      line treatment was limited by significant complications including permanent flatus or fecal&#xD;
      incontinence. Chemical sphincterotomy was introduced as a promising first line treatment due&#xD;
      to its safe side effect profile and comparable healing rate. Topical Nitro donor initially&#xD;
      showed a reasonable healing rate, but it was associated with high rate of significant&#xD;
      headache leading to early termination of the therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Calcium channel blockers (CCB) were then introduced to the market due to its known systemic&#xD;
      vasodilator effect. Systemic administration of CCB is associated with various side effects&#xD;
      including hypotension, positional hypotension, and flushing, but the topical agents were&#xD;
      associated with minimal systemic side effects while demonstrating potent local vasodilator&#xD;
      effect. Several randomized clinical trials have shown excellent healing rate, and safe side&#xD;
      effect profile of both topical Diltiazem and Nifedipine. Currently, both agents are&#xD;
      prescribed as the standard of care for first line treatment of symptomatic anal fissure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To the investigators' knowledge, there is no study comparing the efficacy of topical&#xD;
      Diltiazem and Nifedipine directly. The investigators aim to design a pragmatic randomized&#xD;
      clinical trial to compare the efficacy, and side effect profile of topical Nifedipine and&#xD;
      Diltiazem in treatment of chronic anal fissure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will be a prospective, randomized, double-blinded study involving patients with&#xD;
      chronic anal fissure undergoing 12-week treatment course of 2% Diltiazem ointment with 1.5%&#xD;
      lidocaine vs. 0.3% Nifedipine ointment with 1.5% lidocaine. Patients with IBD, anorectal&#xD;
      surgery, infection, radiation, instrumentation, obstetrical injuries, or patients who are&#xD;
      currently pregnant will be excluded. Both the surgeons and the participants will be blinded&#xD;
      from the agent being used. The participants will be followed up in the clinic at 3 months to&#xD;
      evaluate patient reported outcome and physical exam findings of anal fissure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary outcome is the anal fissure related symptoms reported by the patients upon completion&#xD;
      of the therapy. Physical exam findings will documented and to aid in assessment of the&#xD;
      response to the therapy, but patient reported outcome will be the most important clinical&#xD;
      information to assess efficacy of the therapy. Secondary outcome include rate of side&#xD;
      effects, patient compliance rate, recurrence rate, and time from cure to recurrence.&#xD;
      Recurrence is defined by return of symptoms related to anal fissure in patients who&#xD;
      experienced resolution of symptoms.&#xD;
