  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to enroll patients with confirmed or suspected acute infection with Severe&#xD;
      Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) who do not meet criteria for hospital&#xD;
      admission according to protocols developed by the Honduras Ministry of Health (MOH). Patients&#xD;
      who are triaged to home must also be over the age of 60 years or have one high risk&#xD;
      comorbidity in order to meet inclusion criteria. These patients will be randomly assigned to&#xD;
      one of three home-based care strategies, which may or may not include in-person home visits,&#xD;
      regular blood oxygenation monitoring, and provision of alcohol-based hand-rub. Patients will&#xD;
      be followed until resolution of their acute illness, and data will be collected on&#xD;
      feasibility, impact and acceptance of the intervention. Some patients will be followed for up&#xD;
      to one year to monitor for post-COVID-19 symptoms.&#xD;

      Rationale:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This project is intended to enhance the existing MOH home-based care approach by providing&#xD;
      additional resources and monitoring for patients with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 that&#xD;
      are triaged to Home-based care (HBC) by MOH triage clinicians. In addition, given limited&#xD;
      data on which home-based care strategies most effectively and efficiently minimize poor&#xD;
      outcomes, we aim to monitor three discrete home-based care approaches. Assignment to&#xD;
      home-based care approach will be randomized. Given the primary goal of the project is to&#xD;
      reduce morbidity and mortality due to the COVID-19 pandemic, we will not include a control&#xD;
      arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Setting:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The project location will be the designated municipalities in Honduras. Activities will be&#xD;
      conducted in the existing MOH triage centers (known by the Spanish acronym for Temporary&#xD;
      Triage and Stabilization Centers: &quot;CETTE's&quot;) that are distributed throughout the country.&#xD;
      Selection of target CETTE's will be performed in collaboration with the Honduras MOH and&#xD;
      based on criteria including current and projected COVID-19 hotspots, mortality data and&#xD;
      logistical considerations including access and security.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Project Population:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study population is CETTE patients â‰¥ 21 years old with confirmed or suspected COVID-19&#xD;
      assessed to be higher-risk for potentially poor outcomes but defined in the triage center as&#xD;
      clinically stable and suitable for home-based care according to existing Honduras MOH&#xD;
      COVID-19 protocols. The assessment of which patients will be discharged to home will be&#xD;
      conducted by MOH clinicians according to existing MOH protocols.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients presenting to triage centers with confirmed or suspected acute infection with&#xD;
           SARS-CoV-2.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients triaged to HBC by MOH clinicians according to existing MOH policies and&#xD;
           protocols.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Greater than 60 years of age OR at least one comorbidity which increases risk for poor&#xD;
           outcomes due to COVID-19.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Live or work in the city where the study is being implemented&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Agrees to participate and signs informed consent&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Less than 21 years of age&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Incapable of giving assent to participate due to medical condition at the time of&#xD;
           enrollment&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening and recruitment will occur in the CETTE's. Patients that are evaluated by MOH&#xD;
      clinicians and triaged to HBC will undergo further screening by project staff to assess if&#xD;
      they meet project inclusion criteria. Those that (i) are triaged to HBC by MOH clinicians and&#xD;
      (ii) meet the additional project inclusion criteria will be enrolled by study staff.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Home based care strategies&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be assigned at the time of enrollment to one of three following home-based&#xD;
      care strategies using a block randomization approach:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Strategy 1: Study staff will perform daily phone-based assessments using standardized&#xD;
           electronic study tools (tablets). Clinical features will be documented on a phone-based&#xD;
           patient monitoring form.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Strategy 2: Study staff will perform daily phone-based assessments using standardized&#xD;
           electronic study tools (tablets). Clinical features and oxygen saturation levels will be&#xD;
           documented on a phone-based patient monitoring form. Oxygen saturation level will be&#xD;
           assessed four times per day (morning, midday, evening, plus during the phone-based&#xD;
           assessment) by the patient and/or family member and the lowest stable (i.e. without&#xD;
           substantial fluctuations) level recorded during a monitoring period of one minute will&#xD;
           be recorded and registered. Patient's will be provided monitoring sheets to record the&#xD;
           times and dates of the oxygen saturation levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Strategy 3: Study staff will perform daily in-person home-based assessments using&#xD;
           standardized electronic study tools (tablets). Clinical features and oxygen saturation&#xD;
           levels will be documented on a patient monitoring form. Oxygen saturation level will be&#xD;
           assessed at the time of the in-person evaluation by a project study staff member. The&#xD;
           lowest stable (ie without substantial fluctuations) level recorded during a monitoring&#xD;
           period of one minute will be recorded and registered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Referral to higher level of care:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients meeting referral criteria of oxygen saturation (SpO2)&lt;92% or other alarm signs will&#xD;
      be referred to the nearest CETTE or hospital care according to existing MOH guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Home-based care kits and strategies:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All study participants will receive COVID-19 HBC kits that will include soap, cloth face&#xD;
      coverings, information sheets on COVID-19 prevention, and other supplies. Half the COVID-19&#xD;
      home kits will include a two-week supply of ABHS. HBC kits with and without ABHS will be&#xD;
      randomly assigned to study participants using a random number generator. Patients assigned to&#xD;
      Strategy 2 will be supplied with a portable pulse oximeter and trained on use and measurement&#xD;
      by study staff prior to discharge from the triage center. Patients who are triaged to HBC by&#xD;
      CETTE's but are deemed ineligible for study enrollment may also be provided with an HBC kit&#xD;
      if resources are available.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Discharge from daily clinical monitoring:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will receive daily monitoring until they are discharged from the daily&#xD;
      monitoring program. Criteria for discharge are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Ten days post-symptoms onset and 24 hours without fever. Patients meeting these criteria&#xD;
           will be discharged from the daily monitoring program. If a patient continues to&#xD;
           experience fever more than 10-days post-symptoms onset they will continue to receive&#xD;
           daily monitoring until they are fever-free for more than 24 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Referral to a higher level of care. If a patient is referred to a higher level of care,&#xD;
           they will be discharged from the daily monitoring program. Patients that are not&#xD;
           referred to a higher level of care will continue in the daily monitoring program until&#xD;
           criteria #1 is met.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection and survey tools:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Baseline survey All enrolled patients will complete a baseline survey that will include&#xD;
           demographic and clinical information, risk factors, hand hygiene practices and other&#xD;
           WASH variables, and sociobehavioral questions. Survey questions will include timing and&#xD;
           nature of symptoms, and COVID-19 compatible symptoms, if anyone else in the household&#xD;
           has had COVID-19 symptoms in the past 30 days, and if so, when they began and how long&#xD;
           they lasted. The enrollment survey will also assess risk factors of the participant and&#xD;
           household members such as which household members leave the house for work or school and&#xD;
           if there are any other possible exposures to COVID-19. Specific questions about the WASH&#xD;
           component include assessing the participants' knowledge, attitudes, and practices about&#xD;
           hand hygiene in the month prior to visiting the triage center. The enrollment survey&#xD;
           will assess access to hand hygiene resources in the participants' homes by asking about&#xD;
           access to water and soap in the participants' homes. The estimated time to complete&#xD;
           baseline enrollment and questionnaire is 20-25 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Daily acute COVID-19 symptoms Study staff will document clinical features including&#xD;
           vital signs and alarm signs or symptoms during each daily follow-up visit using a&#xD;
           standardized form. Data on COVID-19 compatible symptoms among household members will&#xD;
           also be collected; gender and age of household members will be recorded but no&#xD;
           additional identifiable information will be collected. These questions will allow&#xD;
           investigators to assess if other household members were infected or become infected with&#xD;
           COVID-19 as a result of likely in-home transmission or community acquired infection.&#xD;
           Daily clinical follow-up evaluations are estimated to take 10 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Inpatient chart review Patients with SpO2&lt;92% or who otherwise are decompensating are&#xD;
           referred back to the triage centers or to a higher level. In these cases, investigators&#xD;
           will abstract data on clinical course and patient outcomes from relevant health&#xD;
           facilities. A standard data abstraction form will be completed for study subjects who&#xD;
           were hospitalized or received outpatient supplemental oxygen in the CETTE. Data&#xD;
           collected will include patients' disposition at admission and discharge, treatment&#xD;
           received, and length of stay. Each inpatient chart review is estimated to take two hours&#xD;
           including travel time for study staff.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Follow-up hand hygiene assessment Serial follow-up WASH survey will be administered&#xD;
           every week and at discharge (from acute COVID-19 daily monitoring) during the daily&#xD;
           follow-up contacts for the HBC study. The follow-up survey will repeat questions about&#xD;
           hand hygiene practices to assess changes in hand hygiene behavior after visiting the&#xD;
           triage center and receiving the HBC kit. Last, the follow up survey will also assess the&#xD;
           safe usage of the ABHS in the home by asking if there have been any adverse events (e.g.&#xD;
           splash in eye or ingestion). This questionnaire is estimated to take 5 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Exit interview from acute COVID-19 monitoring All study participants will be&#xD;
           administered a phone-based exit interview to understand their opinions and level of&#xD;
           satisfaction with the care provided in each study arm. This questionnaire is estimated&#xD;
           to take 5 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Assessment of study staff perceptions After finishing follow up for their tenth HBC&#xD;
           patient, study staff will complete an electronic survey to assess staff acceptance and&#xD;
           feasibility of HBC with or without pulse oximetry. This questionnaire is estimated to&#xD;
           take 5 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Chronic COVID-19 symptoms Following discharge from acute COVID-19 daily monitoring,&#xD;
           study staff will administer phone surveys to all study participants a minimum of every 3&#xD;
           months through the course of the project to assess COVID-19 sequelae and use of health&#xD;
           services. Participants may be offered a medical assessment during the follow-up period&#xD;
           of symptoms monitoring. Data will be collected using a standardized Post-Covid&#xD;
           Conditions Questionaire. Longitudinal follow-up phone surveys to assess for chronic&#xD;
           COVID-19 symptoms are estimated to take 5 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Indicators:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific indicators will be used to assess the feasibility, impact and acceptance of the HBC&#xD;
      intervention. Although final indicators may be updated and/or modified, the preliminary set&#xD;
      of indicators are listed below.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Feasibility&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Proportion that receive the prescribed follow-up plan&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Proportion with complete pulse oximetry data, for relevant arms&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Loss to follow-up&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Referral to higher level of care&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Proportion referred to higher level care due to hypoxia (i.e. SpO2 &lt; 92%)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Proportion referred to higher level care due to alarm symptoms&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Proportion referred to higher level care for any other reason&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Proportion referred that reach higher level of care within 24 hours&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Proportion who successfully complete HBC without requiring referral&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Disposition after referral (home, admission, other)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  SpO2 level upon arrival to higher level of care&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Other clinical measures upon arrival to higher level of care&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Impact on patient outcomes:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Duration of hospitalization (days)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Duration of ICU and/or ventilator requirement*&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Mortality*&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Acceptability&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Perception of utility/benefit of strategy (CHW/patients/family)&#xD;
