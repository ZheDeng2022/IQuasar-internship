  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The excessive accumulation of fluid between the membranes surrounding the lung, a clinical&#xD;
      condition commonly referred to as &quot;pleural effusion&quot;, is caused by one of three factors:&#xD;
      increased production of pleural fluid, decreased ability to reabsorb pleural fluid or a&#xD;
      mixture both.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The basis of pleural effusion accumulation may originate from multiple pathologies: from&#xD;
      benign and extrapulmonary conditions to intrinsic pleural pathology (inflammatory or&#xD;
      neoplastic primary or metastatic) in which the accumulation of fluid in the pleural space is&#xD;
      mainly due to changes in the structure of the pleural membrane (loss of integrity and / or&#xD;
      infiltration by neoplastic cells).&#xD;
&#xD;
      An example of extrapulmonary conditions is the pleural effusion observed in patients with&#xD;
      congestive heart failure in which there is increase in hydrostatic capillary pressure, due to&#xD;
      failure of the cardio circulatory pump.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The distinction between benign and malignant causes is currently a diagnostic challenge that&#xD;
      usually requires the collection of material (cells immersed in the pleural fluid or even a&#xD;
      histological sample).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first step of this investigation is currently the cytological evaluation of the pleural&#xD;
      fluid, that is, the observation of cells, of an initial sample of the pleural fluid. This&#xD;
      procedure is associated with an average sensitivity of 62% while a second sample through&#xD;
      thoracentesis improves the sensitivity of the diagnosis by 10%. In certain cases, however, it&#xD;
      is not possible to diagnose by analyzing the pleural fluid and, as a rule, a more invasive&#xD;
      diagnostic method is recommended, such as pleural biopsy (collected by puncture with a&#xD;
      &quot;blind&quot; needle, echo guided or computed tomography guided or obtained by means of direct&#xD;
      visualization of the pleural cavity through pleuroscopy).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The diagnostic yield of this approach can reach up to 97% (in the case of pleural biopsy&#xD;
      obtained by medical thoracoscopy). However, it implies greater morbidity and greater&#xD;
      consumption of resources (material and human). The development of a more sensitive and&#xD;
      specific and at the same time less invasive diagnostic method for pleural fluid may&#xD;
      contribute to a more effective screening of patients, limiting the use of more invasive&#xD;
      methods to only patients with a higher risk of malignant pathology.&#xD;

&#xD;
      Study Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This project consists of a preclinical study where we will explore new methodologies for&#xD;
      clinical evaluation, based on proteomic analysis of the immunological characteristics and the&#xD;
      microenvironment of the tumor in the pleural fluid of patients whose diagnosis has not been&#xD;
      confirmed. The results obtained will be used in the implementation of an algorithm for the&#xD;
      classification of pleural fluid in the following groups: a) low risk or benign; b) high risk&#xD;
      or malignant. If the algorithm has good sensitivity and specificity for malignant diagnoses,&#xD;
      it may be useful to distinguish patients in to the groups: a) postpone the invasive test and&#xD;
      do active imaging surveillance; b) proceed to invasive testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Benefit / Risk Assessment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The collection of the pleural fluid will be carried out by procedures used in standard care&#xD;
      and diagnosis of the disease, thus not constituting additional risks to the participants. The&#xD;
      results of this investigation do not bring clinical effects directly applicable to the&#xD;
      participants involved. However, in the future the results obtained may benefit other users&#xD;
      through improved understanding the tumor microenvironment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Modalities of Recruitment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Through an interview with the investigating doctor, the participant in this study becomes&#xD;
      aware of the terms of the treatment of his personal data in the scope of the research&#xD;
      project. In addition, data subjects sign informed consent for participation in the study. The&#xD;
      notification includes an explanation of the procedures involved in the investigation and the&#xD;
      role of personal data collected in the context of the investigation. In an interview with the&#xD;
      investigating doctor and by signing the informed consent for participation in the study, the&#xD;
      data subject becomes aware of his right to withdraw from the study and / or to withdraw his&#xD;
      informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The collection of biological samples for the comparative prospective cohort study will be&#xD;
      carried out in all collaborative hospitals in this project in a period of two to three years.&#xD;
      Based on the variance and statistical power observed in a previous study of the pulmonary&#xD;
      fluid exosome proteome, 200 samples were estimated as the minimum number for the&#xD;
      classification of biological samples. The analysis of statistical power is based on the&#xD;
      variance observed in 10 samples in which approximately 3500 proteins were identified and&#xD;
      quantified in pulmonary fluids. The statistical power analysis considers the correction for&#xD;
      multiple tests according to the number of proteins identified and quantified.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection specifications:&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the consultation, a clinical interview will be conducted, which will allow the&#xD;
      collection of personal data, namely genetic data, data related to health and racial or ethnic&#xD;
      origin. An objective exam will also be carried out to assess weight, height, blood pressure&#xD;
      and heart rate. Data relating to the results of complementary diagnostic tests will be&#xD;
      collected, namely: 1. Chest X-ray (location, extent and characteristics of the pleural&#xD;
      effusion); 2. chest ultrasound (location, extent, characterization of the ecostructure -&#xD;
      homogeneous / heterogeneous; with / without visible septations); 3. Thoracic Computed&#xD;
      Tomography (location, extent, morphological aspect of the pleura - thickness increase,&#xD;
      nodules, etc.); 4. Cytological evaluation of the pleural fluid; 5. Serum biochemical study:&#xD;
      blood glucose level; assay of total proteins and serum albumin; lactate dehydrogenase level.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The reference diagnostic method will be based on histological evaluation of the tissue. The&#xD;
      results of the proteomics analysis obtained in this project will not be taken into account&#xD;
      for the final diagnosis of the participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specification of collection and final destination of biological samples:&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to the clinician's decision, pleural fluid will be obtained for diagnosis (through&#xD;
      thoracentesis or during the course of pleural biopsy or pleuroscopy). The sample obtained&#xD;
      will follow the usual clinical investigation pathway (cytological and / or histopathological&#xD;
      evaluation, biochemical evaluation, microbiological evaluation) as registered in each&#xD;
      institution. For patients who agree to participate in the study, only an additional sample of&#xD;
      pleural fluid will be sent for the study that we propose to carry out. These last samples&#xD;
      will be stored at CEDOC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Text of information to be provided to volunteers:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study for which we ask for your consent aims to develop a diagnostic method with greater&#xD;
      specificity and sensitivity in identifying different pathologies associated with excessive&#xD;
      accumulation of pleural fluid (a condition commonly known as pleural effusion). Currently,&#xD;
      the cytological evaluation, that is, the observation of cells, of an initial sample of the&#xD;
      pleural fluid has an average sensitivity of 62% while a second sampling through thoracentesis&#xD;
      (consists of aspiration of the liquid from the pleura through the puncture of the chest wall)&#xD;
      improves the sensitivity of the diagnosis by 10%. In certain cases it is not possible to&#xD;
      diagnose by analyzing the pleural fluid and as a rule a more invasive diagnostic method is&#xD;
      recommended, such as pleural biopsy or pleuroscopy (surgical technique that allows you to&#xD;
      directly view the inside of the rib cage) with pleural biopsy (sensitivity 98%). The&#xD;
      development of a diagnostic method with greater specificity and sensitivity of the pleural&#xD;
      fluid, thus avoiding invasive methods, can improve the efficiency in screening patients with&#xD;
      pleural effusion, limiting the invasive study to a selected portion of patients with an&#xD;
      effectively higher risk of malignant pathology. Your participation in this study does not&#xD;
      involve additional procedures beyond those that your doctor considers necessary for the&#xD;
      diagnosis of the disease or prescription of specific drugs for the study in question. The&#xD;
      collected samples will be anonymized with a code, that is, it will not be possible for the&#xD;
      researchers to match the samples with the personal data of the respective patients. Any of&#xD;
      the data collected will be confidential, in accordance with the new General Data Protection&#xD;
      Regulation (GDPR) that came into force last May 2018 (Regulation (EU) No. 2016/679).&#xD;
