  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to investigate the effects of VR and MI techniques in addition to&#xD;
      routine physical therapy on motor skills, balance and ADL in patients with Parkinson's&#xD;
      disease.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Parkinson's disease is one of the most common, insidious neurological disorders with major&#xD;
      motor symptoms, including bradykinesia, resting tremors, rigidity, and postural disorders.&#xD;
      Virtual reality and motor imagery are among the more innovative techniques for rehabilitation&#xD;
      of patients with Parkinson's disease that promote motor learning through both explicit and&#xD;
      implicit processes.This study is unique in that it examines the effects of VR versus MI on&#xD;
      motor skills, balance, and daily living activities in individuals with Parkinson's disease&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Unified Parkinson's disease Rating Scale Part II</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>This is a subjective instrument that is widely used in clinical settings for patients with Parkinson's disease. This scale comprises 31 elements, which are divided into three sub-scales: Sub-scale II comprises the evaluation of activities in daily living. A possible maximum of 199 points can be scored on this scale. A score of 199 refers to complete disability and 0 refers to the absence of disability .</description>

    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>This is a subjective instrument that is widely used in clinical settings for patients with Parkinson's disease. This scale comprises 31 elements, which are divided into three sub-scales and sub-scale III evaluates the motor system. A possible maximum of 199 points can be scored on this scale. A score of 199 refers to complete disability and 0 refers to the absence of disability</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Berg Balance Scale (BBS)</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>The scale has been established as the most widely used assessment tool in clinical settings to identify changes in balance performance. A score of less than 45 is considered a limit for the risk of falling, while a score of 56 relates to functional balance</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Activities-specific Balance Confidence Scale (ABC):</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>This scale is used as a predictor of falls in patients with neurological deficits. Patients are rated from 0% to 100%, with 0% interpreted as not at all safe and 100% as completely safe</description>
