    <textblock>
      In patients undergoing physical therapy after stroke, extracellular thiol-disulfide balance&#xD;
      and intracellular oxidized-reduced glutathione balance levels will be monitored. The main&#xD;
      objectives of this study are; (1) to determine the differences between thiol-disulfide and&#xD;
      GSH-GSSG balances in stroke patients compared to healthy volunteers, (2) to evaluate the&#xD;
      relationship of these balances with the severity of stroke, (3) to determine the predictive&#xD;
      value of the levels of these balances on clinical prognosis and functional recovery outcomes,&#xD;
      and (4) to investigate and to examine the effects of the physical therapy process on these&#xD;
      parameters and functional recovery and their relationship with each other.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Stroke is among the most common causes of all deaths and Disability-Adjusted Life Years&#xD;
      (DALYs) in the world. There is a close relationship between stroke pathophysiology and&#xD;
      post-stroke clinic with oxidative stress. Thiol-disulfide homeostasis systems, which is one&#xD;
      of the important extracellular and intracellular oxidative stress markers, showing&#xD;
      antioxidant capacity with SH form, and oxidative status with disulfide (SS) form. In this&#xD;
      study, we aimed to evaluate the relationship between the clinical outcome of subacute stroke&#xD;
      patients and extracellular thiol-disulfide (SH-SS) and intracellular oxidized-reduced&#xD;
      glutathione (GSSG-GSH) homeostasis and the comparison of these with healthy volunteers. In&#xD;
      addition, the effect of the rehabilitation program on these oxidative stress markers and&#xD;
      clinical scores and the predictive value of these oxidative stress parameters on prognosis&#xD;
      were also evaluated. The main objectives of this study are; (1) to determine the differences&#xD;
      between thiol-disulfide and GSH-GSSG balances in stroke patients compared to healthy&#xD;
      volunteers, (2) to evaluate the relationship of these balances with the severity of stroke,&#xD;
      (3) to determine the predictive value of the levels of these balances on clinical prognosis&#xD;
      and functional recovery outcomes, and (4) to investigate and to examine the effects of the&#xD;
      physical therapy process on these parameters and functional recovery and their relationship&#xD;
      with each other.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, which is designed as a prospective observational study, patients with subacute&#xD;
      stroke who have a stroke for the first time and are admitted to the hospital for the first&#xD;
      rehabilitation treatment and healthy volunteers (control group) will be included. The&#xD;
      clinical conditions of the patients will be evaluated at the beginning and after the 4-week&#xD;
      rehabilitation program at the time of discharge by National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale&#xD;
      Scores (NIHSS), modified Rankin Scale (mRS) and Barthel Daily Living Activities Index (BI).&#xD;
      Serum and whole blood samples will be obtained from the patient group at the beginning and at&#xD;
      discharge, and from the control group. The SH-SS homeostasis parameters (SH, Total SH, SS and&#xD;
      SS / SH percent ratio) from serum samples and GSSG-GSH homeostasis parameters (GSH, Total&#xD;
      GSH, GSSG and GSSG / GSH percentage ratio) from whole blood samples will be determined. Age,&#xD;
      gender, hemiplegic side, type of stroke will be noted. Later, statistical analysis will be&#xD;
      conducted.&#xD;
