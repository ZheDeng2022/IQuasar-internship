  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A single dose, two-period trial where participants will be first given either of the 3&#xD;
      tocilizumab products on Day 1 during Period 1 and on Day 43/44/45 during Period 2&#xD;
      (flexibility for check-in for Period 2 given upto 3 days) either one of the remaining 2&#xD;
      tocilizumab products which the participant did not recieve earlier. Names of the 3&#xD;
      tocilizumab products are DRL_TC, RP and RMP. So if a participant receives DRL_TC on Day 1&#xD;
      Period 1 then he/she will either recieve RP/RMP on Day 43/44/45/46 during Period 2.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will be conducted at 3 sites (2 in New Zealand and 1 in Australia)&#xD;
&#xD;
      The three pairwise product comparisons (DRL_TC vs. RP; DRL_TC vs RMP and RP vs. RMP) will be&#xD;
      performed in parallel. Each comparison will be separately considered. Study subjects will be&#xD;
      randomly assigned in a 1:1:1 ratio to one of the comparisons and within each comparison&#xD;
      subjects will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to one of the two possible product sequences&#xD;
&#xD;
      The total duration of the individual subject study participation will be approximately 12-16&#xD;
      weeks. Dosing for period 1 will be on on day 1 followed by washout out period of 6 weeks.&#xD;
      Dosing for Period 2 will be on Day 43/44/45/46 (Felxibility for Period 2 check-in given upto&#xD;
      3 days).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects who complete the study and are found to be positive for anti-drug antibodies (ADA)&#xD;
      on Day 71 and/or Day 85, will be followed up every 90 days for immunogenicity sampling up to&#xD;
      approximately one year post Period II dosing, or until two consecutive samples have been&#xD;
      negative for ADA, whichever is earlier. Early dropouts will be tested for immunogenicity at&#xD;
      the time of EOS and if they are positive for ADAs they will be followed-up if possible at 90&#xD;
      days intervals starting from the last received dose (either Period I or Period II) in a&#xD;
      similar manner.&#xD;
&#xD;
      300 NHV (Normal Healthy Volunteers) will be included in the study as justified under sample&#xD;
      size justification. After the data of these 300 volunteers become available a blinded sample&#xD;
      size re-estimation (BSSR) will be performed to reconfirm the statistical assumptions of the&#xD;
      study design and depending upon the outcome of the BSSR, study may be stopped or the sample&#xD;
      size may be increased, as needed to attain the required statistical power.&#xD;
