  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective observational case-control study comparing quantitative sensory testing&#xD;
      data preformed during the third trimester of pregnancy and within 24 hours postpartum in&#xD;
      women on medication-assisted treatment for opioid use disorder (OUD) to a gestational&#xD;
      age-controlled cohort of women who do not have OUD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary goal is to measure elements of quantitative sensory testing including temperature&#xD;
      pain threshold, temperature pain tolerance, and thermal and mechanical temporal summation for&#xD;
      patients with opioid use disorder on medication-assisted treatment (MAT), and compare these&#xD;
      results to gestational age matched controlled pregnant patients not on MAT.&#xD;

      The objective of this study is to measure elements of quantitative sensory testing including&#xD;
      temperature pain threshold, temperature pain tolerance, and thermal and mechanical temporal&#xD;
      summation for patients with opioid use disorder on medication-assisted treatment (MAT), and&#xD;
      compare these results to gestational age matched controlled pregnant patients not on MAT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis is that women requiring maintenance opioids during pregnancy will have a&#xD;
      significant difference in pain sensitivity in the third trimester and immediately postpartum&#xD;
      as compared to women who did not require maintenance opioids during pregnancy.&#xD;
