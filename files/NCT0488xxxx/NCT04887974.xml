  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Various malocclusions require the extraction of the first premolars and retraction of the&#xD;
      canines with the need for maximum anchorage. If the canines are pulled into the extraction&#xD;
      space using the molar teeth for support, unwanted tooth movement occurs. This study aims to&#xD;
      evaluate the effect of temporary anchorage devices and power arms, which are auxiliary&#xD;
      orthodontic appliances in reducing undesirable tooth movements.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In orthodontic patients who require overjet correction, increased facial convexity, or relief&#xD;
      of severe crowding, dental extraction followed by canine retraction is indicated. In&#xD;
      conventional orthodontic treatment, the molars are used for anchorage and reinforced with&#xD;
      intra-oral or extra-oral appliances. Although effective, this produces unwanted side effects&#xD;
      where the molars move mesially and rotate, taking up some of the extraction space. As the&#xD;
      canines move into the extraction space they tip backward requiring further uprighting. Power&#xD;
      arms are vertical metal extensions placed in the canine brackets. They direct the force to&#xD;
      the center of resistance of the tooth to allow bodily movement and prevent canine tipping.&#xD;
      Temporary anchorage devices (TADs) are minimally invasive, small screws, inserted in the jaw&#xD;
      bones to act as anchorage units instead of the molars.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aims to evaluate the effect of the TADs and power arms on the efficiency of canine&#xD;
      retraction including the rate of canine retraction and canine tipping as well as mesial molar&#xD;
      drift and rotation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The null hypothesis is that the use of the power arm and the TADs have no effect on the&#xD;
      canine retraction rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is a single-arm, single-center study. Twenty quadrants in 10 adult patients will&#xD;
      be selected from the Orthodontic Outpatient Clinic at the Future University in Egypt.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Orthodontic records will be collected including study models, intra- and extra-oral&#xD;
      photographs and cone beam computed tomograms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Molars will be banded and Roth 0.22&quot; brackets will be bonded to the canine and second&#xD;
      premolars. Power arms, 8mmin length, will be inserted in the vertical slots of the canine&#xD;
      brackets.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The dental arches will be leveled and aligned using consecutive archwires. TADs will be&#xD;
      inserted between the second premolars and first molars. The first premolars will then be&#xD;
      extracted and canines will be retracted within a week. Canines will be retracted along 0.016&quot;&#xD;
      X 0.22&quot; stainless steel archwires using 150 g of force applied by an elastomeric chain. The&#xD;
      elastic chain will be replaced every 4 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After 6 months of canine retraction, the orthodontic records will be collected for&#xD;
      comparison.&#xD;
