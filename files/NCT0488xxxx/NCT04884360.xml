&#xD;
             3, Participants are eligible if they fulfil any of the following surgical criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Stage III: primary debulking surgery with macroscopic residual disease post-surgery,&#xD;
             neoadjuvant chemotherapy, or inoperable.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Participants must have received platinum-based chemotherapy consisting of a minimum of&#xD;
             6 treatment cycles and a maximum of 9, however, if platinum-based therapy must be&#xD;
             discontinued early as a result of toxicities specifically related to the platinum&#xD;
             regimen, participants must have received a minimum of 4 cycles of the platinum&#xD;
             regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants must have, in the opinion of the investigator, clinical CR or PR as per&#xD;
             RECIST 1.1 criteria with no measurable lesion &gt; 2 cm on the post-treatment scan and&#xD;
             have no clinical evidence of disease progression or a rising CA-125 level (see&#xD;
             inclusion criterion 5), following completion of this chemotherapy course.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A participant who received interval debulking surgery must have had ≥ 2 postoperative&#xD;
             cycles of platinum-based therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
             5, Participants must meet one of the criteria specified below for pre-treatment CA-125&#xD;
             measurements as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  CA-125 in the normal range or&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  CA-125 decrease by ≥ 90% during their front-line therapy that is stable for at least 7&#xD;
             days (ie, no increase &gt; 15% from nadir. If the first value is greater than the upper&#xD;
             limit of normal (ULN), a second assessment must be performed at least 7 days after the&#xD;
             first. If the second assessment is &gt; 15% more than the first value, the participant is&#xD;
             not eligible).&#xD;
&#xD;
             6, Participants should not have received bevacizumab with first-line chemotherapy or&#xD;
             be planned to receive bevacizumab maintenance therapy.&#xD;
