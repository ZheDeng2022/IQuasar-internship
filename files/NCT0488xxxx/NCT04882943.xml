  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic cough (TC), defined by a duration exceeding 8 weeks, is a particularly frequent&#xD;
      symptom with a prevalence observed at 9.6% 1. Chronic cough is the cause of a major handicap&#xD;
      for patients with a impact on their quality of life 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although CT is common, management is often delicate and complex. In studies, asthma,&#xD;
      gastroesophageal reflux disease, posterior flushing, rhino-sinusitis, or taking tussigenic&#xD;
      medications are common causes of chronic coughs. However, chronic refractory or unexplained&#xD;
      cough, which corresponds to cough for which no cause has been found or the treatments&#xD;
      directed against the cause of the cough have not made it possible to resolve the cough, is a&#xD;
      real problem in practice. nick3.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is currently no prospective data in France on the characteristics of chronic cough&#xD;
      (etiologies, response to treatment) and the percentage of refractory cough.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the study is to constitute a French prospective multicenter hospital cohort of&#xD;
      chronic cough patients in order to identify, for the first time in France in a prospective&#xD;
      and multicenter manner, the frequency of patients with refractory cough among chronic cough&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;

      Visit V1: Visit as part of the treatment After obtaining no objection, the patient will&#xD;
      complete cough questionnaires&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit V2: Visit as part of the treatment Visit carried out at 3 months with evaluation of the&#xD;
      cough on the criteria of severity and quality of life. An evaluation of the response to&#xD;
      treatments initiated at visit V1 will be carried out.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit V3: Visit as part of the treatment Visit carried out at 6 months either by telephone if&#xD;
      response to treatment at 3 months (at the discretion of the investigators) or in the&#xD;
      investigative center if no response to treatment at 3 months. An evaluation of the cough on&#xD;
      the criteria of severity and quality of life will be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit V4 to V8: Visit within the framework of research Phone call every 6 months made by a&#xD;
      research technician. Patient severity and quality of life questionnaires will be issued in&#xD;
      advance and completed at the time of telephone contact.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The end of research visit corresponds to the V8 visit.&#xD;
