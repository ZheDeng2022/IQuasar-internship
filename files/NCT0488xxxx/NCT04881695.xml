  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Premature ovarian failure (POF) is a rare condition, affecting 1 in 10,000 women before age&#xD;
      20 and 1 in 1,000 women before age 30. The two main causes of POF are congenital and&#xD;
      acquired.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with POF who carry out the desire to have a child turn to medically assisted&#xD;
      reproduction through oocyte donation or to adoption.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main endpoint of this study is to compare the desire to have children among women with&#xD;
      premature ovarian failure (POF) aged 18 to 26 years vs. controls of the same age (stratified&#xD;
      by age) without major menstruation disorder.&#xD;

      Premature ovarian failure (POF) is a rare condition, affecting 1 in 10,000 women before age&#xD;
      20 and 1 in 1,000 women before age 30. The two main causes of POF are congenital and&#xD;
      acquired.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with POF who carry out the desire to have a child turn to medically assisted&#xD;
      reproduction through oocyte donation or to adoption.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main endpoint of this study is to compare the desire to have children among women with&#xD;
      premature ovarian failure (POF) aged 18 to 26 years vs. controls of the same age (stratified&#xD;
      by age) without major menstruation disorder. The primary endpoint is the percentage of women&#xD;
      with POF reporting a desire to have a child (yes / no) vs. controls of the same age with&#xD;
      normal gonadal function/ The answers will be collected on two online questionnaires.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary endpoints are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Look for a difference in the desire for a child according to the age at the diagnosis of&#xD;
           POF, the cause of POF, the intake of hormone replacement therapy and the age of the&#xD;
           patients at the time of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Assess the sexual life of women in POF.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Assess the psychological state of women with POF-related infertility and help identify&#xD;
           those with symptoms of anxiety or depression. He will be assessed by the Hospital&#xD;
           Anxiety and Depression Questionnaire to help identify those with symptoms of anxiety or&#xD;
           depression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The women will be contacted by email and will receive a newsletter. The controls will be&#xD;
      recruited from patients who have visited at least once at bicetre Hospital and who do not&#xD;
      have a condition that could impair fertility. They must not have been pregnant or must not be&#xD;
      pregnant at the time of the study. The email will contain a questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We estimate that 120 patients will meet the inclusion and non-inclusion criteria among the&#xD;
      patients on the Unit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Considering that 80 patients (2/3) will answer the questionnaires, we will be able to include&#xD;
      80 patients and 80 controls in our study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proportion of women wishing to have children, in the general population, in the study age&#xD;
      group is estimated at 90%. Including 160 participants will allow us to show a 20% difference&#xD;
      in the proportion of desire to have children in patients with POF, with a power of 90%, an&#xD;
      alpha risk of 5% and a bilateral formulation.&#xD;
