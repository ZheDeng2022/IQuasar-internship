  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Peripheral artery disease (PAD) is a highly prevalent condition affecting up to 10% of&#xD;
      Veterans that leads to loss of walking ability and increased risk of amputation. Veterans&#xD;
      have limited access to supervised exercise therapy, a facility-based program proven to&#xD;
      improve walking ability in PAD, which is poorly attended due to the inconvenience and cost of&#xD;
      attending a 12-week program with multiple weekly sessions. This CDA-2 application will&#xD;
      investigate the feasibility of home-based exercise therapy (HBET) delivered using mobile&#xD;
      health (mHealth) technologies in Veterans with symptomatic PAD. We will partner with the&#xD;
      MOVE! program to deliver HBET through group behavioral coaching and a novel wearable activity&#xD;
      monitor in a newly proposed program called Smart MOVE!. There is a clear need to provide&#xD;
      effective and convenient alternatives to supervised exercise for Veterans with PAD. This&#xD;
      study will provide evidence to proceed with Smart MOVE!, a much-needed patient-centered&#xD;
      rehabilitation program for Veterans with PAD.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      An estimated 8.5 million Americans (or 7% of US adults) and nearly 10% of veterans are&#xD;
      estimated to have peripheral arterial disease (PAD). Significantly debilitating and&#xD;
      negatively impacting quality of life, the primary symptom of PAD is claudication&#xD;
      (reproducible leg pain with ambulation) that leads to impaired mobility, loss of functional&#xD;
      independence, and a heightened risk for amputation. Veterans are at an increased risk of&#xD;
      developing symptomatic PAD due to their disproportionately high rates of PAD risk factors&#xD;
      such as diabetes, smoking, and hypertension, the most prominent PAD risk factors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Supervised exercise therapy is proven to decrease claudication and enhance mobility in PAD;&#xD;
      however, fewer than 25% of eligible patients enroll. Participation in this facility-based&#xD;
      program requires travel to a rehabilitation center 3 times per week for 12-weeks, which can&#xD;
      be burdensome and costly for Veterans, many of whom live in rural areas and on fixed incomes.&#xD;
      There is, therefore, a need to develop a convenient and effective alternative exercise&#xD;
      rehabilitation program for Veterans with PAD, particularly in light of safety considerations&#xD;
      now associated with this population's travel to group facilities in the current COVID&#xD;
      pandemic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A promising approach to increase access to exercise rehabilitation for PAD is remote,&#xD;
      home-based exercise therapy (HBET). HBET programs combine self-led walking exercises with&#xD;
      health coaching and exercise tracking with a wearable activity monitor. Adapting HBET to PAD&#xD;
      is difficult, however, due to the added complexity of an exercise prescription that requires&#xD;
      the patient to walk until they experience near-maximal leg pain. Even with active coaching,&#xD;
      successfully implementing HBET for PAD with long-term adherence has been difficult in the&#xD;
      past. The goal is of this study is to leverage newer mobile health (mHealth) tools to adapt&#xD;
      HBET for PAD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This technology-enhanced approach for HBET will be conducted by partnering with a successful&#xD;
      VA lifestyle program, MOVE!, which has demonstrated success in achieving sustained weight&#xD;
      loss and reduced diabetes onset through lifestyle modification. As increased physical&#xD;
      activity is a core element of MOVE!, participation may help increase adherence with HBET for&#xD;
      PAD. This newly proposed program, Smart MOVE!, will be a multi-component program featuring a&#xD;
      tailored version of MOVE! and a novel mHealth device to improve convenience, access, and&#xD;
      adherence to HBET for PAD.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>Patients will be randomized to Smart MOVE! vs. usual care using block randomization. Randomization will be stratified by baseline 6MWT performance using computer-generated blocks of 2, 4, and 6 to reduce imbalance. A blinded assessor will perform baseline assessment before randomization with condition assignments concealed in prepared envelopes that will be opened after all assessments are completed. Based on the nature of the intervention, it is not feasible to blind participants to their allocation status following randomization or study staff measuring post-assessment outcomes as both the PI and study staff are involved in delivering the intervention.</intervention_model_description>
