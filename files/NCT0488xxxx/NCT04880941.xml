    <measure>Anxiety in Palliative Caregivers</measure>
    <time_frame>1 week</time_frame>
    <description>The State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) is a commonly used measure of trait and state anxiety (Spielberger, Gorsuch, Lushene, Vagg, &amp; Jacobs, 1983). It can be used in clinical settings to diagnose anxiety. It also is often used in research as an indicator of caregiver distress. Form Y, its most popular version, has 20 items for assessing trait anxiety and 20 for state anxiety. State anxiety items include: &quot;I am tense; I am worried&quot; and &quot;I feel calm; I feel secure.&quot; Trait anxiety items include: &quot;I worry too much over something that really doesn't matter&quot; and &quot;I am content; I am a steady person.&quot; All items are rated on a 4-point scale (e.g., from &quot;Almost Never&quot; to &quot;Almost Always&quot;). Higher scores indicate greater anxiety.</description>
