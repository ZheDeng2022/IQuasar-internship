      This is a phase I / II, multi-center, single-arm, open-label study to evaluate the safety and&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase I / II, multi-centre, single-arm, open-label study with two parts, a&#xD;
      dose-escalation phase (Part I) and a dose-expansion phase (part II). In part I, patients with&#xD;
      osteosarcoma whose prior standard treatment have failed will be assigned to receive&#xD;
      sequentially higher doses of ALMB-0168 intravenously. The dose-escalation initially will&#xD;
      follow an accelerated titration design for the first two dosing groups, then follow a classic&#xD;
      3+3 design. The maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) of&#xD;
      ALMB-0168 will be determined in part I. In Part II, 1-3 expansion cohorts will begin to&#xD;
      further assess the safety profile and explore efficacy, and each cohort will enroll up to 60&#xD;
      patients with high-grade osteosarcoma in each cohort. All patients will receive multiple&#xD;
      administration of ALMB-0168 until either the disease progresses or intolerable toxicity&#xD;
      occurs.&#xD;
