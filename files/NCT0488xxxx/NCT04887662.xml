  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this project is to determine whether regular consumption of fermented&#xD;
      vegetables can decrease inflammation and change the types of bacteria that are normally&#xD;
      present in the large intestine. Recent research studies have linked the gut bacteria to many&#xD;
      disorders and conditions, such as obesity, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, etc. We also&#xD;
      know that certain bacteria are considered probiotic bacteria because they contribute to a&#xD;
      healthy gut, while others have been associated with inflammation and disease. Fermented foods&#xD;
      may contain beneficial bacteria that may improve health in humans. However, there is a lack&#xD;
      of research studies examining the effects of regular consumption of fermented foods on&#xD;
      health. This study will help investigators better understand if regular consumption of&#xD;
      fermented vegetables can improve inflammation and change the gut bacteria towards a more&#xD;
      beneficial profile.&#xD;

      Investigators will recruit 90-100 participants for this study. Participants will be recruited&#xD;
      by posting flyers throughout Jacksonville, social media advertisements, and by advertisements&#xD;
      on public radio. Recruitment flyers and advertisements will direct potential participants to&#xD;
      email or call study staff or visit the study website. The study website will direct potential&#xD;
      participants to answer the screening questions and those found to be eligible will be asked&#xD;
      to provide contact information so that study staff can contact them to schedule an&#xD;
      orientation via zoom. The study orientation will last approximately 45 minutes and will&#xD;
      include a PowerPoint presentation about the study, outlining all procedures and a thorough&#xD;
      review of the consent form.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the study orientation, participants will be given two weeks to contact the study if&#xD;
      they wish to participate. Those who decide to participate will be asked to schedule their&#xD;
      baseline appointment by calling or emailing the study. During the initial appointment,&#xD;
      participants will be asked to sign a copy of the consent form and any additional questions&#xD;
      they might have about the study will be answered. Both the baseline and follow up visits will&#xD;
      take place in building 39/39A, 3rd floor. The time frame between the orientation and the&#xD;
      baseline appointment will range between 2 and 3 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedures prior to each clinic visit&#xD;
&#xD;
      There will be a total of two clinic visits, and the same procedures apply to both:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once participants schedule their first visit, they will be mailed a stool collection kit&#xD;
      containing three collection tubes, a collection hat, and a liner for the collection hat,&#xD;
      along with instructions on how to collect the stool samples. These instructions will also be&#xD;
      available on the study's website. These samples will be collected prior to the first clinic&#xD;
      visit, so that participants can bring the collection tubes with them to the clinic visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will also be sent information on how to fill out online questionnaires and they&#xD;
      will be asked to complete the questionnaires prior to their clinic visit. The questionnaires&#xD;
      will ask about demographic information, medical history, diet history and physical activity.&#xD;
      The study website will contain all the data collection materials, so that enrolled&#xD;
      participants can easily access these documents. Every randomized participant will receive a&#xD;
      password to the website to access the study's materials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedures during each clinic visit The two clinic visits will take approximately 45 minutes,&#xD;
      each and they will be scheduled in the morning hours, because participants will have to fast&#xD;
      for 12-hours to provide blood samples. Participants will be greeted by study staff and their&#xD;
      temperature will be checked as part of the covid screening. Then, they will be taken to the&#xD;
      body composition assessment lab, for measurement of weight, height, and body fat % using the&#xD;
      InBody 570. Participants will be asked to stand on a platform and hold on to the handles of&#xD;
      the equipment for approximately 2 minutes for the assessment of body composition. Next,&#xD;
      participants' blood pressure will be measured twice using a digital blood pressure monitor&#xD;
      and they will be asked to recall their food consumption over the past 24 hours(24-hr diet&#xD;
      recall). Lastly, trained nurses will collect approximately 16 mL of blood in two tubes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the first clinic visit, participants randomized into the treatment group will receive&#xD;
      print materials about a heart-healthy diet and a four-week supply of fermented vegetables&#xD;
      with a measuring cup for easy portioning of the vegetables. They will also be asked to fill&#xD;
      out an electronic symptoms log where they will list any side effects associated with food&#xD;
      consumption, weekly. Participants randomized to the control group will only receive print&#xD;
      materials about a heart-healthy diet, but they will also be asked to fill out the symptoms&#xD;
      log.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following the first clinic visit, participants will be contacted by study staff once a week&#xD;
      by phone or text-message, depending on their preferred method of contact. The weekly checks&#xD;
      will serve to remind participants to fill out the symptoms log and to check on compliance in&#xD;
      the case of the treatment group, by asking participants if they skipped any days or consumed&#xD;
      less vegetables than prescribed for the week. At four weeks, all participants will be asked&#xD;
      to provide another 24-hr diet recall, and another four-week supply of fermented vegetables&#xD;
      will be delivered to participants in the treatment group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection All questionnaire data will be filled out electronically with the exception&#xD;
      of the three 24-hr recalls that will be done in person or by phone. All questionnaire data&#xD;
      will be identified with a unique ID number that will be assigned to each participant. There&#xD;
      will be only one file that will include participants' name with ID numbers, which will be&#xD;
      password protected and stored in a secured drive.&#xD;
