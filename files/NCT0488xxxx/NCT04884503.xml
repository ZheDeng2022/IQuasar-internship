      The burning mouth syndrome (BMS) is a chronic pain syndrome of the oral mucosa. Patients have&#xD;
      experiencing a burning sensation, pain, stinging, or numbness in the mouth along with a&#xD;
      feeling of dryness, paraesthesia, taste disturbance or hypersensitivity. The complaints are&#xD;
      usually bilateral, of moderate intensity, they persist for a minimum of 4-6 months and&#xD;
      concern the clinically unchanged membrane mucous.The psychiatric aspect of BMS is very&#xD;
      important. The presence of BMS has been shown to be associated with depression, increased&#xD;
      anxiety levels, hypochondria, and carcinophobia and emotional instability&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first step is to determine the specific type of BMS, i.e. to exclude a causal&#xD;
      relationship with the existing local factors, general diseases and medications taken.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The pathophysiology of Primary Burning Mouth Syndrome is unclear. Due to the lack of&#xD;
      morphological changes in the oral cavity with the simultaneous occurrence of troublesome pain&#xD;
      symptoms, it is now assumed that pain in BMS has a neuropathic mechanism.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Among the psychotropic drugs, the most commonly used in the treatment of BMS was clonazepam,&#xD;
      a drug with anticonvulsant and anxiolytic properties .&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, the investigators used clonazepam because of which it has proven effectiveness&#xD;
      in therapy in combination with a tongue protector made for the purpose of the test. Use of a&#xD;
      tongue protector in the form of a bag put on it 3 times a day is relatively new method of&#xD;
      treatment, which is to exclude the detachment of the tongue's para-function on burning.&#xD;
&#xD;
      60 patients were qualified for the study, of which 57 patients, including 34 women and 23&#xD;
      men, aged 47-77 years, took part in the program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pain assessment The symptoms of pain intensity BMS were assessed using the VAS (Visual Analog&#xD;
      Scale) The duration of burning was also assessed, the type of burning according to Levis, the&#xD;
      occurrence of taste disturbances and their determination, subjective feeling of dry mouth,&#xD;
      place of burning sensation: tongue, palate, lips, mucosa of the mouth vestibule with gums,&#xD;
      cheek mucosa The psychologist cooperating in the project conducted and then interpreted four&#xD;
      psychological tests: STAI (state and trait anxiety inventory) and the Beck Anxiety Scale BAI&#xD;
      and the Beck Depression Scale BDI. Moreover, the WHOQOL quality of life test was carried out&#xD;
      - according to WHO&#xD;
&#xD;
      A follow-up examination was performed on the day of treatment completion and 3 months later&#xD;
