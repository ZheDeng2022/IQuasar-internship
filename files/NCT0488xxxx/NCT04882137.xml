  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study seeks to understand how much pediatric providers in Central Florida know about the&#xD;
      etonogestrel contraceptive implant. The investigators also seek to understand the barriers&#xD;
      that may prevent them from referring adolescent women for this highly effective and&#xD;
      recommended method of contraception. Finally the study will consider if an expanded education&#xD;
      and coaching improves their ability to referring patients for this method of birth control.&#xD;

      This study is comprised of two phases. During the first phase 500 medical providers who&#xD;
      provide care to adolescents will be recruited to complete a 30 question anonymous survey that&#xD;
      evaluates their attitudes towards recommending and referring for adolescent women for the&#xD;
      etonogestrel contraceptive device. This survey will also test participant's knowledge of&#xD;
      indications, side effects and side effect management related to this contraceptive device as&#xD;
      well.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During phase 2, 100 pediatric providers will be randomized to two groups. One group will&#xD;
      receive standard continuing medical education on the use of the etonogestrel device in&#xD;
      adolescents focusing on themes that emerged as knowledge deficits in phase 1. The other group&#xD;
      will receive standard continuing medical education plus continued coaching on management of&#xD;
      medication side effects. The referring patterns of physicians in each group will be studied.&#xD;
