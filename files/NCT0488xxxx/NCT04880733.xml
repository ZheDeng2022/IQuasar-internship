  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Our goal is to use the U01 mechanism to conduct a two-arm multisite, feasibility RCT&#xD;
      (Acupuncture vs Usual Care) to refine procedures for conducting a future fully powered&#xD;
      multi-site RCT. The effort will be led by the BraveNet Coordinating Center at Einstein and&#xD;
      include 3 BraveNet PBRN sites University Hospitals/ Case Western Reserve University&#xD;
      (UH/Case), Vanderbilt University Medical Center (VUMC), and University of California-San&#xD;
      Diego (UCSD). During Year 1 (Aim 1), we will develop the manualized acupuncture intervention&#xD;
      with consensus from experts in the delivery of acupuncture for acute pain. At the end of Year&#xD;
      1 (prior to the start of the RCT), a study investigator meeting will be held to ensure&#xD;
      consistent training of all study coordinators and acupuncturists to the study data&#xD;
      collection, human subjects, intervention delivery, and reporting requirements. In Year 2-3&#xD;
      (Aim 2), we will enroll 165 participants (55 per site) into the randomized trial (1:1&#xD;
      assignment to Acupuncture or Usual Care) over a ~9-month enrollment period for each site.&#xD;
      Sites will participate in the study sequentially, thus general findings from the&#xD;
      implementation evaluation may be used to improve implementation at subsequent sites.&#xD;
      Treatment outcomes include pain intensity, state anxiety and pain medication utilization&#xD;
      within the ED (via EHR data extraction). In Aim 2a, 75 structured qualitative interviews of&#xD;
      ED providers, staff, study acupuncturists (~10 per site) and acupuncture patients (~15 per&#xD;
      site) and direct observation at each site will be used to identify barriers and facilitators&#xD;
      of successful implementation. The Implementation Evaluation includes two broad categories of&#xD;
      data: implementation outcomes (collected in Aim 2 as the feasibility study is conducted at&#xD;
      each site) and explanatory factors (Aim 2a).&#xD;

    <description>Participants will be asked to rate their satisfaction with how their pain was managed and their satisfaction with assigned treatment at ED discharge. Separate scores will be calculated for the 1 and 4-week follow-up assessments.

A second question will be asked only of acupuncture-assigned patients: &quot;Overall how satisfied are you with the acupuncture treatment you received your ED visit?&quot; on the same 5-point Likert Scale.</description>

    <description>ED clinical providers (MD, DO, NP, PA) who had patients enrolled in the study will be asked to rate their general satisfaction with how their patients' pain was managed by acupuncture as part of the study. Providers will answer two questions: &quot;How satisfied were you with the acupuncture intervention as delivered in your setting?&quot; and &quot;To what degree was the acupuncture intervention helpful in managing patient pain in your ED setting?&quot; (1-Very satisfied/helpful-5-Very dissatisfied/Not at all helpful).</description>
