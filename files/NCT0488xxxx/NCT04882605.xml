  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The use of haploidentical donors for aHSCT has greatly increased this past decade leading to&#xD;
      a major paradigm shift: while finding 10/10 HLA-matched donors represented the prior&#xD;
      difficulty for decades, the current problem is about finding the best haploidentical donor&#xD;
      among several potential ones. The prediction of NK cells alloreactivity toward leukemic cells&#xD;
      provides promising perspectives, although the underlying biological processes remain unclear.&#xD;
      To date, many prediction models based on KIR and MHC genotyping have been designed and used&#xD;
      across studies, which contribute to blur clinical conclusions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesized that the diversity of models used to predict NK alloreactivity&#xD;
      in aHSCT could partly be responsible for the current literature discrepancies. The main&#xD;
      objective of this work consisted of applying the major KIR-based prediction models in D/R&#xD;
      couples undergoing aHSCT in different fashions - with MSD and haploidentical donors - to&#xD;
      describe their heterogeneity and potential correlations. As clinical data were available for&#xD;
      these two cohorts, the investigators described correlations that could be assessed between&#xD;
      the scoring strategies and the clinical outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As suspected, it was highlighted that the different scoring strategies greatly impact the&#xD;
      assessment of alloreactivity within D/R couples. As an example, two broadly used scoring&#xD;
      strategies - educational models and missing-ligand models - show clear opposite predictions.&#xD;
      Moreover, some scoring strategies seem to be better adapted to genoidentical or&#xD;
      haploidentical cohorts, whereas others are robust across the different cohorts. Concerning&#xD;
      the clinical-biological correlations, it was highlighted that (i) each scoring strategy is&#xD;
      differentially associated to the different outcomes (ii) the different scoring strategies&#xD;
      predict one particular outcome with different efficacy (iii) the D/R compatibility greatly&#xD;
      impacts the pertinence of the scoring strategy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This work therefore contributes to unravel the KIR-based alloreactivity prediction of NK&#xD;
      cells in aHSCT. This would help to overcome the current literature discrepancies in this&#xD;
      field as in making new hypotheses to better understand and predict NK alloreactivity to&#xD;
      further develop its use in medical practice.&#xD;
