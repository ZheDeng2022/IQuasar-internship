  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Exercise helps people with CF lead long, fulfilling lives. Regular exercise reduces&#xD;
      depression and fatigue, and may play a role in preventing exacerbation. However, little is&#xD;
      known about exercise habits in adults with CF, or the barriers to exercise that they face.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the COVID-19 pandemic, lockdowns and social distancing saw gym memberships plummet;&#xD;
      while sale of personal exercise technology, smart-watches, and interactive home equipment&#xD;
      exploded. As this technology becomes more cost-effective and accessible, can it be leveraged&#xD;
      to improve CF care? This study will examine barriers to exercise in CF and the role of smart&#xD;
      devices in exercise. Adults with CF will participate in the Exercise Behaviors/Barriers&#xD;
      Survey, followed by a qualitative discussion on attitudes toward exercise technology, and how&#xD;
      CF impacts exercise. We anticipate that many perceived barriers will be universal (e.g.&#xD;
      time), while others will be unique to CF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be fitted with wrist actigraphy (FitBit Inspire 2) to measure baseline&#xD;
      exercise. They will receive access to three smartphone apps designed for home exercise, as&#xD;
      well as an exercise website designed for the CF community (www.activate65.org), and receive&#xD;
      weekly phone calls from the CF care team offering motivational interviewing. Actigraphy,&#xD;
      heart and respiratory rate, and app usage will be analyzed. After four weeks, participants&#xD;
      will no longer receive calls. Actigraphy will be monitored four additional weeks to determine&#xD;
      if exercise is sustained. We anticipate that exercise will increase during the intervention&#xD;
      period, and that some activity will be sustained in the follow up period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The findings of this study will pave the way for a larger trial using this &quot;Team and&#xD;
      Technology&quot; approach to investigate clinical outcomes. This study highlights the critical and&#xD;
      timely need to investigate the barriers to exercise in CF, and effective solutions to develop&#xD;
      sustainable exercise habits using widely-available technology from home.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Adults with CF aged 18 and above, who have access to either Google Play (Google LLC) or Apple&#xD;
      (Apple Inc.) smart device, and are patients of the University of Virginia Adult CF clinic&#xD;
      will be enrolled in this study. Subjects will be invited by the PI during routine pre-visit&#xD;
      planning for quarterly appointments. Subjects who are unable to provide consent, pregnant or&#xD;
      trying to become pregnant, or have a known physical condition that precludes exercise will be&#xD;
      excluded. Enrolled subjects will serve as their own controls, and there will be an additional&#xD;
      four healthy non-CF controls. We will recruit subjects from each lung function subgroup FEV1&#xD;
      &lt; 40%, FEV1 40-79%, and FEV1 &gt;80%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Enrolled subjects will be screened using the Physical Activity Readiness Questionnaire&#xD;
      (PAR-Q) prior to exercise. Respondents who are not eligible for exercise based on PAR-Q&#xD;
      results will be excluded. Subjects will participate in the Exercise Benefits/Barriers Scale&#xD;
      (EB/BS) to identify perceived benefits and barriers to exercise via online secured Qualtrics&#xD;
      Research Suite link. They will participate in a one-on-one conversation with the PI answering&#xD;
      open-ended questions about how their life experience with CF may impact exercise behavior, as&#xD;
      well as their attitudes toward use of personal technology in exercise. Input will be&#xD;
      qualitatively analyzed for themes that may aid in developing more personalized plans for&#xD;
      exercise engagement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will complete the Short General Health Questionnaire (GHQ 12) to establish&#xD;
      self-reported baseline levels of general physical and mental health. They will be fitted with&#xD;
      a wrist actigrapher (FitBit Inspire 2; Google, LLC). They will receive training on FitBit&#xD;
      usage and how to safely export data via HIPAA-secured electronic communication. For four&#xD;
      weeks, physical activity will be logged, including steps per day, time spent in aerobic&#xD;
      activity, respiratory rate, and heart rate. This will establish baseline levels of activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will then begin the &quot;Team &amp; Technology&quot; exercise intervention. Team: Participants&#xD;
      will receive weekly phone calls from members of the CF care team encouraging exercise and&#xD;
      offering motivational interviewing personalized from earlier interviews. Technology:&#xD;
      Participants will take part in a live demonstration of three subscription-based exercise apps&#xD;
      compatible with Apple and Google Play personal devices, and will receive unlimited access to&#xD;
      all apps. They will also receive access to a mobile-friendly exercise community website&#xD;
      designed by UVA patient partner for adults with CF (www.activate65.org, Elize Hewitt, 2021).&#xD;
      The apps were selected based of their ability to provide a variety of workouts from home&#xD;
      using only body weight, without specialized equipment. Apps included in this study are BodBot&#xD;
      (BodBot, LLC), an AI-learning exercise app that customizes exercise plans to the user and&#xD;
      incorporates body weight and aerobic exercise; SHRED (Shred Labs, LLC), an AI-learning&#xD;
      exercise app that incorporates both muscle-building and aerobic exercise; Seven (Perigee AB),&#xD;
      and J&amp;J Official 7 Minute Workouts (Johnson &amp; Johnson Health and Wellness Solutions, Inc) two&#xD;
      apps that generate high-intensity interval training (HIIT) workouts in 7-minute intervals&#xD;
      based on self-selected skill level. Subjects will be encouraged to exercise using any method&#xD;
      they wish, including using any combination of the technology options, or their own methods.&#xD;
      Multiple apps with different methods and styles have been selected so that any one specific&#xD;
      app does not become the intervention per se, but rather provides exercise options. Physical&#xD;
      activity will be logged, along with app and website usage. After four weeks, EB/BS and GHQ 12&#xD;
      surveys will be repeated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the intervention period, motivational phone calls will end. Subjects will still have&#xD;
      unlimited access to the technology, and will continue to wear actigraphers. Technology usage&#xD;
      and physical activity will be logged at the end of an additional four weeks to assess for&#xD;
      sustainability of exercise habits. Finally, EB/BS and GHQ 12 surveys will be repeated during&#xD;
      a debrief phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This pilot study will identify perceived benefits and barriers to exercise, based on the&#xD;
      unique lived experiences of adults with CF. We will determine whether attitudes toward&#xD;
      exercise correlate with elements of emotional and physical wellbeing, and we will assess&#xD;
      whether perceived benefits and barriers toward exercise can be positively shaped by&#xD;
      motivational interviewing and encouragement from the individual's care team. We will further&#xD;
      determine whether the use of widely available personal smart devices can be leveraged to form&#xD;
      sustainable exercise habits in adults with CF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exercise is a critical component to physical and mental health, and is of particular&#xD;
      importance as we inch closer to a cure for CF. We believe that the qualitative input on&#xD;
      attitudes toward exercise behavior will be a valuable aspect to creating sustainable exercise&#xD;
      plans that address the specific challenged faced by people with CF. We hypothesize that&#xD;
      having access to wrist actigraphy alone will increase physical activity by creating immediate&#xD;
      positive feedback and personal accountability. We further anticipate that having access to a&#xD;
      variety of home workout options, along with personal support and motivational interviewing&#xD;
      from the CF care team, will increase overall exercise habits and positively impact attitudes&#xD;
      toward exercise. We hypothesize that physical activity will decrease in the sustainability&#xD;
      period, but overall activity and attitudes toward perceived barriers will improve compared to&#xD;
      baseline.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If exercise sustainability is observed as we anticipate, we plan to embark on a large,&#xD;
      randomized controlled using pilot data to inform power analysis. This trial will investigate&#xD;
      the role of sustained home exercise in CF on lung function, exacerbation rates, mental&#xD;
      health, BMI, lean muscle composition, and other important clinical outcomes. These questions&#xD;
      are of particular interest in the era of highly-efficacious CFTR modulator therapies that are&#xD;
      extending length and quality of life.&#xD;
