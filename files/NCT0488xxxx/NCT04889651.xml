      This is a randomized, open label, single dose, full replicated crossover study to compare the&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics and safety between BR9004 and BR9004-1 in healthy male subjects under&#xD;
      fasting conditions. To this end, subjects were divided into two sequence groups [Sequence A&#xD;
      (TRTR) &amp; Sequence B (RTRT), T: BR9004, single oral administration, R: BR9004-1, single oral&#xD;
      administration].&#xD;
