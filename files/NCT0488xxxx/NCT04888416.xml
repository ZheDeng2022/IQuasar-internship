      The primary objective of this study is to tailor and test implementation strategies to&#xD;
      support the adoption of two upper extremity motor outcome measures for stroke: the Fugl-Meyer&#xD;
      Assessment and the Action Research Arm Test. The study's interdisciplinary team will address&#xD;
      this objective through the following specific aims: (a) Tailor a package of implementation&#xD;
      strategies (referred to as I-STROM-Implementation STRategies for Outcome Measurement) to&#xD;
      promote outcome measure use across the care continuum, (b) Determine the effectiveness of&#xD;
      I-STROM on outcome measure adoption and (c) Evaluate the appropriateness, acceptability, and&#xD;
      feasibility of I-STROM in rehabilitation settings across the country. The mixed-methods study&#xD;
      design is informed by implementation science methodologies, and the tailoring of I-STROM will&#xD;
      be guided by input from stakeholders, including occupational therapy practitioners and&#xD;
      administrators. The investigators will collect robust quantitative and qualitative data by&#xD;
      means of retrospective chart reviews, electronic surveys, and stakeholder focus groups. This&#xD;
      study, &quot;Strategies to Promote the Implementation of Outcome Measures in Stroke&#xD;
      Rehabilitation,&quot; will address core barriers to outcome measure use through a package of&#xD;
      implementation strategies, thus laying the groundwork for I-STROM scale-up in health systems&#xD;
      nationwide.&#xD;

      Recruitment of Stakeholders. OSUWMC is comprised of several facilities that provide optimal&#xD;
      care to patients throughout Ohio and the Midwest. OSUWMC's acute care hospital serves ~1200&#xD;
      stroke survivors annually. A total of 220 stroke survivors were admitted in 2019 to OSUWMC's&#xD;
      Dodd Rehabilitation Hospital, which is a 60-bed inpatient rehabilitation facility. OSUWMC&#xD;
      also provides outpatient rehabilitation services at its main ambulatory care location, Martha&#xD;
      Morehouse Medical Pavilion, and serves ~150 stroke survivors each year. Additionally, each&#xD;
      setting has an appointed evidence-based practice (EBP) Team Leader who organizes quality&#xD;
      improvement activities to promote the use of evidence in practice. The inpatient Team Leader&#xD;
      will serve as Co-Investigator for the proposed study and regularly collaborates with the Team&#xD;
      Leaders in acute care and outpatient rehabilitation. Three OT practitioners will serve as&#xD;
      outcome measure &quot;champions.&quot; The investigators plan to invite all OT practitioners from acute&#xD;
      (N ~ 30), inpatient (N ~ 15), and outpatient (N ~ 10) as well as administrators (N ~6) to&#xD;
      participate in I-STROM, complete the electronic surveys, and participate in focus groups.&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria for participants include full- or part-time employment at OSUWMC and&#xD;
      experience evaluating stroke survivors or overseeing the provision of stroke care in the past&#xD;
      3-months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Procedures and I-STROM Description. At the start of the study, the PI and Co-I&#xD;
      (Wengerd) will train the three site &quot;champions&quot; on the use of the Fugl-Meyer and Action&#xD;
      Research Arm Test and review procedures for trouble-shooting implementation issues. The study&#xD;
      team will then conduct a baseline retrospective chart review to determine the extent to which&#xD;
      the Fugl-Meyer and Action Research Arm Test have been adopted in acute, inpatient, and&#xD;
      outpatient stroke rehabilitation. Baseline survey data will capture perceptions of (a) the&#xD;
      acceptability, appropriateness, and feasibility of the Fugl-Meyer and Action Research Arm&#xD;
      Test and (b) the core barriers of outcome measure use. In Months 2-4, focus group data will&#xD;
      be collected to inform the tailoring of I-STROM based on the needs of each rehabilitation&#xD;
      setting. Description of I-STROM. Three core strategies will be included in I-STROM: initial&#xD;
      and booster educational meetings, learning collaboratives, and outcome measure champions.&#xD;
      Though the study team will tailor I-STROM to the needs of each of our three settings, the&#xD;
      team expects that initial educational meeting will be delivered in a webinar format that will&#xD;
      be recorded and accessible to stakeholders during and after the study. Follow-up educational&#xD;
      meetings will be held in person on a quarterly basis to assist practitioners with outcome&#xD;
      measure use. Learning collaborative sessions will initially occur quarterly to allow&#xD;
      practitioners to share their outcome measure experiences with their professional peers.&#xD;
      Lastly, the team anticipates that outcome measure champions will meet with the PI at least&#xD;
      2x/month to identify challenges and successes with I-STROM and outcome measure adoption.&#xD;
      I-STROM will be delivered through Months 8-20 of the study with quarterly chart audits&#xD;
      (random 10-30 of eligible charts) to monitor outcome measure use. Upon the conclusion of&#xD;
      I-STROM, we will collect posttest data by administering our follow-up survey to practitioners&#xD;
      and administrators (Month 20) to assess changes in (a) the acceptability, appropriateness,&#xD;
      and feasibility of the Fugl-Meyer and Action Research Arm Test and (b) the core barriers of&#xD;
      outcome measure use. We will supplement survey data with a retrospective chart review to&#xD;
      determine I-STROM's effect on outcome measure adoption over time. Follow-up focus groups with&#xD;
      stakeholders will explore experiences with I-STROM and illuminate how I-STROM can translate&#xD;
      to non-OSUWMC settings. Widespread scalability of I-STROM will be evaluated via an electronic&#xD;
      survey administered (via REDCap) to practitioners and administrators nationwide. T&#xD;
&#xD;
      Retrospective chart reviews. All OSUWMC practitioners document stroke survivor evaluations,&#xD;
      goals, notes, and discharge plans in the EPIC record system. The study team plans to manually&#xD;
      extract the following chart data that pertain to Fugl-Meyer and Action Research Arm Test&#xD;
      implementation (Appendix A): use of Fugl-Meyer (YES/NO), use of Action Research Arm Test&#xD;
      (YES/NO), date of use, and initial onset of client stroke. These data fields will be obtained&#xD;
      by request from OSUWMC's Information Warehouse Honest Broker Operations Committee at the&#xD;
      following study time points: baseline, quarterly during the deployment of I-STROM, and upon&#xD;
      I-STROM's conclusion. The PI (Juckett) and Co-I (Banhos) will extract chart data using an&#xD;
      approach similar to the chart review methodology applied in the PI's dissertation (Juckett et&#xD;
      al., 2019b). Stroke survivors whose charts will be included in our study will (a) have had a&#xD;
      stroke in the past 12-months, (b) receive acute, inpatient, or outpatient services at OSUWMC,&#xD;
      and (c) have undergone an evaluation with an OT. Baseline data will be obtained to examine&#xD;
      outcome measure use among a random 30% of stroke survivor charts from each setting (N ~ 360&#xD;
      acute; N ~ 60 inpatient, N ~ 45 outpatient) 12-months prior to the study start date. Monthly&#xD;
      audits will be performed on eligible charts (10-30 per setting) during the delivery of&#xD;
      I-STROM to monitor outcome measure adoption. At I-STROM conclusion, the study team will then&#xD;
      extract data from another 30% of charts from the previous 12-months to identify pre-post&#xD;
      effectiveness of I-STROM on outcome measure adoption.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Electronic surveys. The first section of this four-part electronic survey will gather&#xD;
      participant demographics. Part two will assess stakeholder perceptions of two core barriers:&#xD;
      networks and communication and culture (Fernandez et al., 2018; Appendix B); the third&#xD;
      section will examine the third core barrier: access to knowledge and information (Gagliardi&#xD;
      et al., 2019). The last section of the survey will assess the acceptability, appropriateness,&#xD;
      and feasibility (Weiner et al., 2017) of implementing the Fugl-Meyer and Action Research Arm&#xD;
      Test. This survey will be administered at baseline and upon I-STROM conclusion. All survey&#xD;
      respondents will receive a $25 gift card for participating at both pre-test and post-test&#xD;
      time points. At I-STROM conclusion, the study team will also administer a nationwide survey&#xD;
      to OT practitioners and administrators in stroke rehabilitation to assess perceptions of&#xD;
      I-STROM's acceptability, appropriateness, and feasibility and other strategies that should be&#xD;
      incorporated into I-STROM to enhance its relevance in diverse practice settings (Appendix C).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Qualitative focus groups. The study team will conduct four focus groups before the deployment&#xD;
      of I-STROM, each group consisting of 5-10 acute OT practitioners, inpatient OT practitioners,&#xD;
      outpatient OT practitioners, and OSUWMC administrators. Focus group data will aid in our&#xD;
      tailoring of core I-STROM strategies. Focus group questions will be guided by the ERIC&#xD;
      taxonomy (Appendix D). After I-STROM completion, the study team will hold another four focus&#xD;
      groups to assess stakeholder perceptions of I-STROM and outcome measure adoption. Focus&#xD;
      groups will last approximately 45 minutes in duration, will be audio recorded (with&#xD;
      permission), and will be transcribed prior to undergoing analysis. Participants will receive&#xD;
      a $25 gift card for each focus group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1. Tailor a package of implementation strategies to facilitate use of the Fugl-Meyer and&#xD;
      Action Research Arm Test across the stroke continuum. Purpose and Design. The study team will&#xD;
      address Aim 1 using an explanatory sequential mixed-methods approach. Investigators will&#xD;
      first identify current rates of Fugl-Meyer and Action Research Arm Test use across the three&#xD;
      continuum sites (chart review) and evaluate the practitioners' perceptions of (a) the three&#xD;
      core barriers that have been found to influence implementation and (b) the acceptability,&#xD;
      appropriateness, and feasibility of implementing the Fugl-Meyer and Action Research Arm Test&#xD;
      (electronic survey). Focus groups with site stakeholders will inform the tailoring of I-STROM&#xD;
      strategies to each of the three practice settings. Data Analysis. Rates of outcome measure&#xD;
      adoption will be evaluated by means of descriptive statistics and will be reported in&#xD;
      percentages. The study team will use bivariate Pearson correlations to examine associations&#xD;
      between Fugl-Meyer and Action Research Arm Test use and practitioner perceptions of core&#xD;
      implementation barriers. Focus group data will be analyzed by two members of the research&#xD;
      team through directed content analysis with coders achieving a Cohen's kappa &gt;.8 to ensure&#xD;
      consistency.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2. Determine the effectiveness of a package of implementation strategies designed to&#xD;
      support Fugl-Meyer and Action Research Arm Test adoption. Purpose and Design. The study team&#xD;
      will use an interrupted time series design to examine the effectiveness of I-STROM on the&#xD;
      adoption of the Fugl-Meyer and Action Research Arm Test over 12-months; follow-up survey data&#xD;
      will represent changes in (a) practitioner perceptions of core barriers and (b) perceptions&#xD;
      of outcome measure acceptability, appropriateness, and feasibility. The study team will&#xD;
      complete follow-up focus groups to identify perceptions of I-STROM and the relevance of&#xD;
      I-STROM across multiple practice settings. Data Analysis. Rates of outcome measure adoption&#xD;
      will be calculated as percentages for all three settings in individual and aggregate form.&#xD;
      Matched-paired t-tests will be used to detect significant differences in (a) outcome measure&#xD;
      adoption, (b) perceptions of acceptability, appropriateness, and feasibility, and (c) core&#xD;
      implementation barriers before and after I-STROM. Magnitude of differences will be expressed&#xD;
      in effect sizes (Cohen's d). The qualitative approach (e.g., directed content analysis) from&#xD;
      Aim 1 will be replicated to examine focus group data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 3. Evaluate the acceptability, feasibility, and appropriateness of I-STROM by OT&#xD;
      practitioners in stroke rehabilitation nationwide. Purpose and Design. The investigators will&#xD;
      use a cross-sectional electronic survey approach to evaluate the acceptability, feasibility,&#xD;
      and appropriateness of I-STROM to other stroke rehabilitation settings. The team will also&#xD;
      invite respondents to provide narrative comments that pertain to additional strategies to be&#xD;
      included in I-STROM to enhance I-STROM scalability and relevance to other sites. Data will be&#xD;
      used to inform future funding proposals that aim to extend I-STROM in a multi-site trial.&#xD;
      Data Analysis. Descriptive statistics will be used to examine I-STROM acceptability,&#xD;
      appropriateness, and feasibility. Demographics (e.g., age, education, practice setting) will&#xD;
      be analyzed by means of multiple linear regression to determine predictors of I-STROM&#xD;
      acceptability, appropriateness, and feasibility. Respondent comments will be examined through&#xD;
      descriptive content analysis by the PI and trained research assistant.&#xD;
