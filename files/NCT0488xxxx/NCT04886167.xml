  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a double-blinded, dose-ranging study in the US to assess the efficacy, safety, and&#xD;
      duration of response of abobotulinumtoxinA for the treatment of moderate to severe platysmal&#xD;
      bands.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is intended to evaluate the efficacy and safety of an initial dose of 120 U, 180&#xD;
      U, and 240 U of abobotulinumtoxinA (with optional touch-up) in the treatment of moderate to&#xD;
      severe platysmal bands. The platysmal bands will be treated by intramuscular injection of&#xD;
      abobotulinumtoxinA.&#xD;
