      This is a dose-escalation, single-arm, single-center open study which aims to evaluate the&#xD;
      maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and dose-dependent toxicity (DLT) of a novel oncolytic vaccinia&#xD;
      virus expressing bispecific antibody RGV004 in patients with relapsed/refractory B-cell&#xD;

    <description>According to the principle of '3+3' dose escalation, if one patient experiences a Dose limiting Toxicity (DLT), up to three additional patients will be treated at the same dose level. If DLT is observed in only one of six patients treated at a given dose level, the next cohort of three patients will be treated at the next higher dose level. If two or more patients experience DLT at a particular dose level, then the dose escalation will cease and any subsequent patients will be treated at a lower dose level. Thus finding the Max tolerated dose (MTD)</description>
