  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase I, randomized, double-blind, two-group parallel, positive-controlled clinical&#xD;
      trial at four sites. Subjects will be sequentially enrolled according to the protocol in one&#xD;
      of two cohorts and receive a single 0.5mg of CMAB818 or Lucentis® through intravitreal&#xD;
      injection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective is to assess the initial clinical safety of intravitreal injection of&#xD;
      CMAB818 or Lucentis® in patients with wet age-related macular degeneration (wet-AMD).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objective are to assess immnogenicity, pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamics and&#xD;
      the initial clinical efficacy of intravitreal injection of CMAB818 or Lucentis® in patients&#xD;
      with wet age-related macular degeneration (wet-AMD).&#xD;
