  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This project will develop, implement, and evaluate models for use of point-of-care nucleic&#xD;
      acid testing (POC NAT) among HIV-negative persons seeking HIV testing, PEP, and PrEP and&#xD;
      HIV-positive persons in community and clinical settings. Study aims #1 and #2 will evaluate&#xD;
      the sensitivity and specificity of a qualitative POC NAT in persons not known to be&#xD;
      HIV-positive and will determine the impact of its use on PrEP uptake and persistence among&#xD;
      persons testing HIV-negative and on time to HIV continuum of care outcomes among persons&#xD;
      testing HIV-positive. Aim #3 will implement a POC NAT-tailored behavioral intervention to&#xD;
      evaluate impact on time to virologic suppression among PLWH receiving ART. Aim #4 will&#xD;
      quantify the acceptability and feasibility of implementation of POC NAT in community and&#xD;
      clinical settings and collect cost and related data for cost-effectiveness analyses. Finally,&#xD;
      in Aim #5, a distinct but related study will compare the sensitivity, specificity, and&#xD;
      agreement of multiple POC NATs over a range of HIV RNA levels.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>For the aim #3 RCT, we will randomize participants 1:1 to the POC NAT intervention arm and to standard of care. The intervention will include a SAMBA test and adherence counseling intervention developed by the study team to accompany delivery of test results. The study team will train participating primary care providers (PCPs) in delivery of the adherence counseling intervention.&#xD;
Study staff will discuss the study, obtain informed consent, and, for participants randomized to POC NAT, perform SAMBA and provide results to the PCP. Study staff will perform venipuncture, ensure that individual laboratory NAT is performed, and administer a brief CASI. PCPs will deliver the POC NAT result and adherence counseling intervention to patients during their visit. Participants will be asked to sign an ROI that allows the study to share POC NAT results with the PCP and allows the study staff to obtain outcomes measures from clinical patient data for longitudinal follow up.</intervention_model_description>

    <ipd_description>Intellectual property and data generated will be administered in accordance with UW and CDC policies. Final determinations for data sharing will be based on guidelines for use determined by the Publication Committee. Data obtained during this project will be available at the end of the funding cycle or within a year of publication of major findings, whichever is later. Requests for data or specimens must be made in writing, and human subjects approval must be obtained prior to data transfer. Data will be provided from the Data Center electronically, stripped of identifying information. Investigators receiving data will be asked to sign an agreement stipulating that they will (1) use data only for not-for-profit research purposes (unless negotiated otherwise with the Publication Committee); (2) not attempt to identify any individual participant; (3) secure data using appropriate technology and not share data with anyone else; and (4) destroy data after analyses are completed.</ipd_description>
