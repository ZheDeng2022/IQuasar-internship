      This study includes prolonged second stage phase and not prolonged second phase in pregnant&#xD;
      women to singletons at the weeks between 37-42. Fetal head level will be at or below the&#xD;
      ischial spines in all patients.Patients with fully dilated cervix will be included in the&#xD;
      study and the bladder will be emptied completely on the labor table. Patients diagnosed with&#xD;
      fetal distress will not be included in the study.Indicated patients will be randomly divided&#xD;
      into three groups; one group will be only subjected to a Fundal Pressure (Kristaller&#xD;
      Maneuver), second group will only be subjected to Vacuum Extraction and the third group will&#xD;
      be subjected to both Fundal Pressure (Kristaller Maneuver) and Vacuum Extraction. Maternal&#xD;
      episiotomy needs presence of second and third degree perineal tears, presence of postpartum&#xD;
      hemorrhage and need for blood transfusion , cesarean rates and fetal first and fifth minute&#xD;
      Apgar score , fetal blood gas parameters, presence of fetal trauma, need for neonatal&#xD;
      intensive care will be evaluated among three randomized groups.&#xD;
