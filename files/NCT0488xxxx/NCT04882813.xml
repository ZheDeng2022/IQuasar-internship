    <textblock>
      Investigators are building an empirical evidence base for real world data through large-scale&#xD;
      replication of randomized controlled trials. The investigators' goal is to understand for&#xD;
      what types of clinical questions real world data analyses can be conducted with confidence&#xD;
      and how to implement such studies.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a non-randomized, non-interventional study that is part of the RCT DUPLICATE&#xD;
      initiative (www.rctduplicate.org) of the Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical&#xD;
      School. It is intended to replicate, as closely as possible in healthcare insurance claims&#xD;
      data, the trial listed below/above. Although many features of the trial cannot be directly&#xD;
      replicated in healthcare claims, key design features, including outcomes, exposures, and&#xD;
      inclusion/exclusion criteria, were selected to proxy those features from the trial.&#xD;
      Randomization is also not replicable in healthcare claims data but was proxied through a&#xD;
      statistical balancing of measured covariates through standard practice. Investigators assume&#xD;
      that the RCT provides the reference standard treatment effect estimate and that failure to&#xD;
      replicate RCT findings is indicative of the inadequacy of the healthcare claims data for&#xD;
      replication for a range of possible reasons and does not provide information on the validity&#xD;
      of the original RCT finding.&#xD;

        This study will involve a new user, parallel group, retrospective cohort study design&#xD;
        comparing dapagliflozin to sitagliptin. Although the trial compared dapagliflozin to&#xD;
        placebo, for the current emulation we used an active comparator, sitagliptin, which is a&#xD;
        dipeptidyl peptidase - (DPP-4) inhibitor. This is because both dapagliflozin and&#xD;
        sitagliptin are guideline recommended as second to third line therapies used for the&#xD;
        treatment of type 2 diabetes at the same stage of the disease and sitagliptin is not&#xD;
        expected to have an effect on the primary outcome.&#xD;
