  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Endometrial carcinoma is the most common malignancy of the female reproductive tract. Most&#xD;
      cases are diagnosed at an early stage due to the appearance of symptoms such as&#xD;
      postmenopausal bleeding. However, endometrial carcinoma carries a poor prognosis when it&#xD;
      recurs after previous definitive treatment or when diagnosed at an advanced stage.The 5-year&#xD;
      survival rate for FIGO III is approximately 57-66% and for FIGO IV is approximately&#xD;
      10-20%.The combination of PARP（poly adenosine diphosphate-ribose polymerase）inhibitors and&#xD;
      PD1/PD-L1 has the theoretical support of preclinical molecular biology. In recent years, a&#xD;
      large number of basic studies and preclinical models have confirmed that this combination&#xD;
      therapy has superimposed or even synergistic effects on multiple levels.This study intends to&#xD;
      explore the efficacy and safety of anti-PD-1 antibody combined with niraparib in the&#xD;
      treatment of recurrent or advanced endometrial cancer.&#xD;

      This study is an open, multi-center, prospective single-arm Phase II study to study the&#xD;
      effectiveness of niraparib combined with sintilimab in the treatment of recurrent/advanced&#xD;
      endometrial cancer that has failed or cannot be tolerated by chemotherapy Sex and safety. The&#xD;
      study intends to enroll 37 patients who have undergone histopathologically confirmed&#xD;
      recurrence/advanced endometrial cancer who have experienced first-line and above chemotherapy&#xD;
      failure or intolerance and received niraparib combined with sintilimab for treatment. The&#xD;
      Simon two-stage design is used to estimate the sample size. For the first type of error, the&#xD;
      value of α (one-sided) is 0.05, the value of β is 0.2, the test power is 0.8, and the ORR of&#xD;
      the second-line chemotherapeutic drug is 15%. It is assumed that the objective population of&#xD;
      niraparib combined with sintilimab in the treatment of the target subject population The&#xD;
      remission rate was 35%. Nine cases were enrolled in the first stage. When the number of&#xD;
      effective cases was ≤1, the combination therapy was considered to be no better than the&#xD;
      single drug, and the trial was terminated. Otherwise, continue with the enrollment of 25&#xD;
      cases in the second stage. Assuming a loss rate of 10%, 37 subjects are expected to be&#xD;
      enrolled in the trial.&#xD;
