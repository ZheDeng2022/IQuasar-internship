  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Learning impairments (such as reduced selective learning or excessive generalization) in the&#xD;
      context of pain can lead to disability. Learning deficits have been found in experimental&#xD;
      studies in various pain populations. In current scientific discussions, the activation of&#xD;
      resilience factors (in particular positive affect and optimism) is being considered to&#xD;
      optimize learning experiences and to make therapeutic procedures more effective. Positive&#xD;
      affect could promote selective learning since positive emotions broaden attention and focus&#xD;
      and thus possibly improve inhibitory learning. There is first scientific evidence for&#xD;
      improved safety learning through positive affect in non-clinical samples in the context of&#xD;
      pain. In this research project, the influence of positive affect and optimism on selective&#xD;
      learning will be investigated in a clinical sample of fibromyalgia patients. Data will be&#xD;
      collected online and standardized questionnaires will be used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The authors expect that (1) There will be a larger increase in positive affect and positive&#xD;
      future expectations in the Best Possible Self condition than in the Typical Day condition.&#xD;
      (2) Patients in the Best Possible Self condition will show elevated positive affect and&#xD;
      positive future expectations after the intervention compared to patients in the Typical Day&#xD;
      condition. (3) And crucially, patients in the Best Possible Self condition will show better&#xD;
      selective learning than patients in the Typical Day group. Thus the investigators hypothesize&#xD;
      that the blocking effect will be higher for patients with higher degrees of positive affect&#xD;
      and optimism.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Selective learning will be experimentally investigated by using the blocking procedure. The&#xD;
      blocking effect is one mechanism that can provide information about selective learning. In&#xD;
      this procedure, one event (A+) will be first paired with pain. Participants should learn the&#xD;
      relation between this event and the occurrence of pain. After, another event (x), i.e. the&#xD;
      blocking stimulus, is displayed with the first event A (AX+). The combination of both events&#xD;
      will also be associated with pain. It will be tested, to which extent participants expect&#xD;
      pain for the blocking stimulus alone. In case of &quot;blocked&quot;, i.e. reduced pain expectation for&#xD;
      X we can assume adaptive, selective learning.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the planned study a fictitious diary of a fibromyalgia patient will be used as &quot;cover&#xD;
      story&quot;. Different events and the words &quot;pain&quot; or &quot;no pain&quot; will be visually presented&#xD;
      together, indicating in which situation pain occurs and in which not. Participants will be&#xD;
      asked to imagine that they are the practitioner trying to learn which situations are&#xD;
      associated with pain. This learning experiment is based on a former study by Meulders and&#xD;
      colleagues, in which selective learning was investigated by presenting fictitious diary&#xD;
      entries, such as &quot;Kim was walking her dog&quot; or &quot;the weather was bad today&quot; (CS) and pairing&#xD;
      the sentences in terms of the blocking procedure (see above). In the central test phase, in&#xD;
      which events were presented without pain report, participants were asked to give their pain&#xD;
      expectations for the different situations. Deficits in selective learning were found in&#xD;
      fibromyalgia patients compared to healthy control. For the planned study this learning&#xD;
      paradigm will be used with minor adaptations (translated to German, minor instruction&#xD;
      adaptations, renamed scale ends, higher scale resolution). The learning experiment will take&#xD;
      about 15 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Positive affect and optimism will be induced through the Best Possible Self (BPS)&#xD;
      Intervention. Subjects will be randomly assigned to either the optimism condition or a&#xD;
      control condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The whole study will be conducted online. Participants will be asked to switch from the&#xD;
      experimental platform to the questionnaire platform at various times. In order to recreate&#xD;
      the laboratory situation and to keep participants engaged, we implemented several videos in&#xD;
      which the virtual investigator guides participants throughout the experiment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sample size should include 164 participants, assuming a small effect. A priori power&#xD;
      analyses were calculated with the software program G*Power for ANOVA with repeated measures,&#xD;
      within-between interaction with a small effect (f=0.1, Power 0.8, α=0.05).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with fibromyalgia will be recruited via social media platforms like Facebook and&#xD;
      Instagram, but also through advertisement in magazines, self-help groups as well as via&#xD;
      flyers in medical offices and clinics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mainly ANOVA´s with repeated measures and t-tests are planned to be calculated. There will be&#xD;
      four separate repeated measures (RM) ANOVA´s on positive and negative Affect and on positive&#xD;
      and negative future expectations with Group (BPS/TD) as between-factor and Time (Pre/Post) as&#xD;
      within-subjects factor. Planned contrasts will also be used to check whether the increase in&#xD;
      a) positive affect and b) positive future expectations (and not a decrease in a) negative&#xD;
      affect and b) negative future expectations) will be larger in the BPS group compared with the&#xD;
      TD group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Further, we will calculate ANOVA´s to test acquisition of pain expectancy in the different&#xD;
      phases. The central analysis will be a 2 x 3 RM ANOVA with Group (BPS/TD) as between-subjects&#xD;
      variable and Stimulus Type (B/Z/X) as within-subjects variable on pain expectancy ratings in&#xD;
      the test phase of the learning experiment. Further, following the literature, the&#xD;
      investigators might do responder analyses and use the change in a) positive affect and b)&#xD;
      positive future expectations as predictors for selective learning (in order to have more&#xD;
      power in statistical analyses, if necessary).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Transformations: Transformations of not normally distributed variables will be done.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inference criteria: We will use the standard p &lt; .05 criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data exclusion: Participants will be excluded from analyses, if they give Z&gt;X ratings in the&#xD;
      test phase or if they give the same rating throughout the whole experiment. Participants, who&#xD;
      did not complete the BPS/TD writing exercise properly will be excluded from ANOVA´s with&#xD;
      group factors.&#xD;
