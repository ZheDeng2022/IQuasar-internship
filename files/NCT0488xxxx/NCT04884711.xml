  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      One of the crucial components of successful ageing is to live independently in old age. Yet&#xD;
      in UK alone, nearly 300000 older people require assistance with 3 or more essential daily&#xD;
      tasks like eating, bathing and mobility which compromises on their independent living.&#xD;
      Additionally, in a crisis where health system in UK is already overstretched to its resources&#xD;
      to combat the recent Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, allocating resources for&#xD;
      regular homecare services has become challenging. In this situation, Digital Health&#xD;
      Technologies (DHTs) can be a potential solution to promote healthy ageing, support&#xD;
      psycho-social wellbeing and enhance independent living for older people. Such technologies&#xD;
      comprise a wide range of products used in the health and care services including apps,&#xD;
      software and online platforms to benefit people. Yet DHTs are barely adopted by older people&#xD;
      as they do not reflect their actual user needs leading to poor appropriation of DHTs in&#xD;
      homecare settings. The investigators aim to address this gap by involving older people living&#xD;
      at the Leach Court, UK under the eco system of the Brighton &amp; Hove Digital Health Living Lab&#xD;
      (BHLL) to co-design with us DHTs that addresses the barriers &amp; facilitators they face in&#xD;
      adopting to DHTs. This participatory research approach has a qualitative study design which&#xD;
      is sensitive to basic human values like 'dignity', appreciates that older people are 'expert&#xD;
      of their experiences' and methodologically has phenomenological underpinnings gathering the&#xD;
      researcher's understanding from the lived experiences of older people. This unique project,&#xD;
      part of the European Union (EU) Horizon 2020 funded INNOVATEDIGNITY project, will be aiming&#xD;
      to translate intangible human values like 'dignity' into tangible technology design through&#xD;
      better understanding of the barriers &amp; facilitators older people face to DHTs adoption. With&#xD;
      global population of older people increasing faster than all other age groups currently, this&#xD;
      project stands to meet the future demands of the ageing population through dignity sensitive&#xD;
      better designed DHTs .&#xD;
&#xD;
      This project is part of the Marie Sk≈Çodowska-Curie Actions (MSCA) Innovative Training&#xD;
      Networks (ITN). This project has received funding from the European Union's&#xD;
      H2020-MSCA-ITN-2018 programme under grant agreement No 813928.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Older people (65 years &amp; above) in UK comprised of 17.8% of the total population (11.3&#xD;
      million) in 2014 with nearly 300000 older people within this group requiring help with 3 or&#xD;
      more essential daily tasks. With progressive age older people are increasingly preferring to&#xD;
      age in place as in home care settings with possibilities of higher dependence on digital&#xD;
      health technologies . Yet such technologies are barely adopted by older people as they do not&#xD;
      reflect actual user needs. The inappropriateness of these products at many times compromises&#xD;
      on human dignity leading to poor adoption.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Designing digital health technologies for the older people living in care settings present&#xD;
      significant challenges in terms of defining such technologies in the design process,&#xD;
      establishing their needs in the relevant care settings and recruiting appropriate group of&#xD;
      study participants. In fact, evidence points towards studies where care providers, family&#xD;
      members, physicians and technologists were key participants which failed to portray the&#xD;
      actual needs of older people. Worst still, technology design studies are mostly conducted in&#xD;
      corporate showrooms or simulated research laboratories which are inadequate to capture real&#xD;
      life settings. Therefore, there is a need for studies that involves older people to create&#xD;
      acceptable, adoptable &amp; adaptable digital health technologies for them.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Furthermore, designing such products for older people also presents challenges in terms of&#xD;
      data privacy, training necessities for upgraded products, complex user interfaces and faulty&#xD;
      devices malfunctioning under complex situations. In a qualitative study engaging older people&#xD;
      of Finland and Spain to explore ethical and privacy related issues around 3 instrumental&#xD;
      activities of daily living (monitoring the taking of medication, sleep monitoring &amp; home&#xD;
      security) found respondents concerned about product costs, data privacy, data confidentiality&#xD;
      and possibilities of their autonomy being challenged. Moreover, respondents raised questions&#xD;
      about devices giving false notifications and alarms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The above stated issues show that there is a significant need to rethink design&#xD;
      considerations of dignified technologies for older people mainly because actual perceptions&#xD;
      of older people are not taken into design considerations leading to poor technology uptake.&#xD;
      From broader perspectives, it can potentially reduce workload of healthcare professionals,&#xD;
      improve data collection from care settings, enhance communication across levels of care and&#xD;
      optimize health expenditure for UK. Therefore, there is a significant importance &amp;&#xD;
      possibility to address the present research gap by including the actual perceptions of older&#xD;
      people in the design process and create technology infused with human factors &amp; dignity to&#xD;
      promote their independent living.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Aim:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To co-design new dignified technologies for care settings in participation with older people&#xD;
      living in the Leach Court, Brighton which is part of the open innovation ecosystem of the&#xD;
      Brighton &amp; Hove Digital Health Living Lab(BHLL), an enterprise project of the University of&#xD;
      Brighton.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To appraise the existing scientific evidence on using participatory approach to create&#xD;
           digital health technologies for older people in care settings.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To explore the perceptions of older people on using digital health technologies for&#xD;
           activities of daily needs.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To analyze the facilitators &amp; barriers of digital health technology uptake for older&#xD;
           people living in care settings.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To identify strategies to enhance dignity and human perspectives in digital design for&#xD;
           older people living in care settings.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. To recommend relevant outcomes of the study to stakeholders for implementation in UK.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The present qualitative study uses phenomenologically led participatory design approach to&#xD;
      involve older people (participants) living in a supported housing facility at the Leach Court&#xD;
      (Brighton, UK) to understand from their lived experiences the barriers &amp; facilitators they&#xD;
      face in digital health technology adoption in everyday life and further, consider them to use&#xD;
      their experience to conceptually co-design with the research team future dignified digital&#xD;
      health technologies that fulfills their needs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Eligibility Assessment: - A participant questionnaire will be used to screen candidates&#xD;
           for the study based on the eligibility criteria. However, the research team will also&#xD;
           consider older people with no exposure to digital health technologies as that can offer&#xD;
           considerable insight on the barriers to digital health technology adoption for older&#xD;
           people.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Face to Face Interviews: 1:1 qualitative open ended interviews will be conducted&#xD;
           preferably at the residence of the participants using phenomenologically led reflective&#xD;
           lifeworld approach. About 2 weeks prior to the interview, participants will be provided&#xD;
           with a 'prompt resource pack' containing an instant analog camera which will be used by&#xD;
           participants to capture photos of digital health technologies they use in everyday life.&#xD;
           Photographs can evoke deeper experiences revealing the latent &amp; tacit needs of the&#xD;
           users. Thereby, strengthening the data collection for this study through a photovoice&#xD;
           approach.&#xD;
&#xD;
           These pictures will be used as probing tools during the interview sessions to gather&#xD;
           rich data to identify the barriers and facilitators of technology adoption for older&#xD;
           people. Participants will be observed &amp; documented for their non-verbal communication&#xD;
           during the interview. Participants may be approached for subsequent interviews to reveal&#xD;
           better understanding of the phenomenon of digital health technology adoption.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Co-design Workshops: 1 month prior to the co-design workshops the investigators will&#xD;
           conduct an awareness seminar which will aim at sensitizing older people about diverse&#xD;
           types of digital health technologies. Purpose of such a seminar will be to raise the&#xD;
           consciousness of participants on such technologies. In Co-design workshops, qualitative&#xD;
           focus group discussions (FGD) based on underpinnings of dialogal phenomenology will be&#xD;
           held with older people who have been part of the earlier data collection process of this&#xD;
           study. The purpose will be to create strategies that can improve acceptance and address&#xD;
           dignity issues with digital health technologies for older people.&#xD;
&#xD;
      COVID-19 Contingency Plan for Data Collection:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In case there is uncertainty in collecting data through face to face interviews and other&#xD;
      methods as has been outlined earlier, the research team will collect data through University&#xD;
      of Brighton's approved online data gathering approaches. This is a forecast based on the&#xD;
      present COVID-19 pandemic situation across the globe.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anonymised data will be analysed phenomenologically to reveal core and unique aspects of the&#xD;
      phenomenon under study. Data from interviews will be analyzed using principles of 'reflective&#xD;
      lifeworld approach' whereby anonymised data will be read multiple times to gain data&#xD;
      familiarity. The text will be subdivided into segments of meaningful units. While reading the&#xD;
      text the site-investigator will be moving back &amp; forth within the data to organize parts of&#xD;
      the whole text in order to see patterns that describe the phenomenon in a logical way to&#xD;
      reveal core &amp; unique aspects of the phenomenon. This is termed as 'whole-parts-whole'&#xD;
      approach.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data from Co-Design workshop will be analysed using principles of dialogal phenomenology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethical Considerations:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study has been approved a favorable ethical opinion based on the details provided above&#xD;
      from the Life,Health &amp; Physical Sciences College Research Ethics Committee (CREC) of&#xD;
      University of Brighton (UK). For consideration of ethical issues pertaining to the project&#xD;
      the investigators have considered the possible vulnerabilities of older people on the ethical&#xD;
      principles of autonomy, beneficence, non-maleficence and justice. The investigators will&#xD;
      perform capacity interviewing at appropriate points during data collection process to&#xD;
      ascertain the participant's capacity to consent for the study. Participant Information Sheets&#xD;
      (PIS) will be provided before all data collection steps so that participants are aware of the&#xD;
      objectives, purpose and process of the study. Informed Consent will be sought after&#xD;
      explaining the PIS to participants and attending to any query from participants that may be&#xD;
      relevant to the study. Participation will be completely voluntary and participants can resign&#xD;
      from the study at any point without citing any reasons. Only anonymised data will be analyzed&#xD;
      and confidentiality of participants will be retained.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Previous Clinical Trials:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the context of this study, the clinical trials database was searched to ascertain that&#xD;
      this study was not a duplication of previous studies. The search of clinical trials database&#xD;
      revealed few studies exploring lived experiences, working on digital health interventions and&#xD;
      co-designing of technologies but none were concerned with dignity perspectives in relation to&#xD;
      digital health technologies. All such trials are provided with an unique National Clinical&#xD;
      Trial (NCT) number.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In terms of lived experiences, two studies were concerned with children (NCT00456209 &amp;&#xD;
      NCT04168515). Most were concerned with health conditions &amp; diseases like Irritable Bowel&#xD;
      Disease (IBD), mental health, prostate cancer etc. (NCT04274725,NCT03131505,&#xD;
      NCT02889536,NCT04399096 &amp; NCT02690272). Few were focused on lived experiences of health&#xD;
      professionals (NCT04168515 &amp; NCT03709537). One study was primarily focused on lived&#xD;
      experiences of older people but did not constitute dignity perspectives in digital health&#xD;
      technology adoption (NCT04503811). One study was identified with co-learning approach for&#xD;
      mental health workforce but this was not related to aged people (NCT03709537).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In terms of digital health, two studies related to the domain of co-designing could be&#xD;
      identified. One involved older people to create a 'digital bridge' (NCT04287192) and another&#xD;
      focused on involving care professionals to improve transitions from stroke unit to the home&#xD;
      (NCT02925871). Another study could be located which involved older people in Accident &amp;&#xD;
      Emergency Department in a hospital but not in homecare settings (NCT04085796).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators could locate one clinical trial on studying the perception changes of&#xD;
      personal dignity during progression of dementia in patients but that study was not involved&#xD;
      with any digital health technologies (NCT04443621).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The review of the existing evidence base on clinical trials reveal that this study is unique&#xD;
      in involving homebound older adults in a co-design approach to improve digital health&#xD;
      technology adoption and enhancing dignity perspectives in digital design.&#xD;
