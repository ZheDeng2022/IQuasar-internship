&#xD;
      Screening: (Must be done up to 7 days prior to initial treatment (Day 0), but can be also&#xD;
      done on the same day as baseline testing and initial treatment) Randomization: (Performed&#xD;
      after determining that patient is eligible for the study) Treatments - three treatments will&#xD;
      be conducted to the study device group. Follow-Up Visits: 4-Weeks (+/-7days) and 12-Weeks&#xD;
      (+/-14 days) after last treatment.&#xD;
