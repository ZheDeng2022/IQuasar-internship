  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an observational study. Measurements were made during two different motor tasks:&#xD;
      trunk tilts without and with the tension of the abdominal muscles in the sitting position and&#xD;
      walking in a place with high knee lifting. It was checked how the intervention (active&#xD;
      tension of the muscles stabilizing the core) changes the parameters of the motor coordination&#xD;
      of the trunk and lower limbs.&#xD;

      Surface electrodes (single-use 55 and 40 mm; ECG Electrodes; Sorimex, Poland) were glued to&#xD;
      the subject's body according to the SENIAM (Surface ElectroMyoGraphy for the Non-Invasive&#xD;
      Assessment of Muscles) procedure for the transverse abdominal, multifidus, and supraspinal&#xD;
      muscles, and a laser rangefinder was attached to the dorsal side at chest height. Before each&#xD;
      exercise, the subject was instructed on how the exercise should be done.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The examination involved two motor exercises. In the first one, the subject was seated on the&#xD;
      therapeutic table (with their upper extremities crossed over their chest) and instructed to&#xD;
      lean forward as far as possible (ideally to place their torso on their thighs) and then&#xD;
      quickly return to their starting position. The movement was repeated three times. Then the&#xD;
      subject performed three more repetitions of the movement with their core engaged (i.e., their&#xD;
      abdominal muscles contracted or &quot;stabilized&quot;). The range of trunk inclination in the sagittal&#xD;
      plane (mm) and in the frontal plane (m), and the reaction of the multifidus, transverse&#xD;
      abdominal, and supraspinatus muscles (tension values reported in microvolts [µV]) were&#xD;
      measured using a millimeter board, laser pointer, rangefinder (measurement/angle of&#xD;
      inclination accuracy of ± 1.5 mm), electrode, and a device for measuring the voltage of&#xD;
      selected muscle groups, Luna EMG (accuracy of measurement [-1-+1V+/-1mV]).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The second exercise was a march-in-place with a high elevation of the knees. This exercise&#xD;
      was also done as quickly as possible (time measured for 20 steps in place in seconds [s]).&#xD;
      The exercise was done in duplicate. On the second occasion, subjects were instructed to do&#xD;
      the exercise with their core engaged (i.e., their abdominal muscles contracted or&#xD;
      &quot;stabilized&quot;). The exercise was performed in duplicate. The duration of the march and the&#xD;
      elevation of the feet were measured, as well as the activity of the multifidus, transverse&#xD;
      abdominal, and supraspinatus muscles.&#xD;
