  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this pilot study it will be investigated if a whole grain product will improve the glucose&#xD;
      response not only when it is eaten at breakfast, but also at the two following meals; lunch&#xD;
      and dinner (2nd and 3rd meal effect) in a healthy population.&#xD;
