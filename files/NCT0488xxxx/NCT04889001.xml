  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Babies born not breathing at birth require effective gentle ventilation to survive and avert&#xD;
      organ damage if initial resuscitation steps such as drying, and stimulation are unsuccessful&#xD;
      at facilitating breathing. Training of health workers to impart skills on ventilation is a&#xD;
      way to prevent these adverse outcomes. Effective ventilation skills are typically acquired&#xD;
      through training programs such as Helping Babies Breath (HBB). However, these ventilation&#xD;
      skills quickly decay following training and current skills retention methods such as&#xD;
      refresher courses are costly and there is a paucity of skilled human resources to effectively&#xD;
      facilitate frequent HBB training courses. This raises the need to explore approaches that are&#xD;
      independent of retraining for skills maintenance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that simulation enhanced HBB training followed by&#xD;
      self-administered ventilation practice (SAVP) sessions with the Augmented Infant Resuscitator&#xD;
      (AIR) as an electronic coach will result into ventilation skills retention over 12 months.&#xD;
      SAVP allows participants to maintain practice and training to enhance skills retention.&#xD;

      The investigators will use a multi-methods approach. First, investigators will evaluate the&#xD;
      effect of simulation enhanced HBB training and short self-administered practice with AIR&#xD;
      device feedback on ventilation skills among undergraduate medical, nursing and midwifery&#xD;
      students in Nigeria, Tanzania, and Uganda over a 12-month period. These short practice&#xD;
      sessions will be conducted in skills labs. The investigators will equip each skills lab with&#xD;
      at least 20 practice stations to enable increased number of students per unit time and reduce&#xD;
      total required time in the skills labs for self-practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Second, the investigators will conduct focus group discussions with students before and after&#xD;
      the intervention, to examine student experiences of simulation with SAVP vis-Ã -vis their&#xD;
      expectations prior and post exposure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design: This will be a 12-month cohort study among medical, nursing and midwifery&#xD;
      students rotating in clinical disciplines. We will use a quasi-experimental design and&#xD;
      measure ventilation skills before and after administration of a simulation enhanced HBB&#xD;
      training plus SAVP with AIR as an intervention. The ventilation skills will also be measured&#xD;
      prospectively every 4 months over a 12-month period in HBB scenario settings.&#xD;
