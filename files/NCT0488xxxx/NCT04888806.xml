  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Currently, comprehensive treatments for liver metastasis/pulmonary metastasis that cannot&#xD;
      reach NED include systemic chemotherapy, interventional chemotherapy, molecular targeted&#xD;
      therapy, immunotherapy, and local treatments (ablation therapy, radiation therapy, etc.) for&#xD;
      liver metastases. Combination therapy model of local ablation, systemic chemotherapy, and&#xD;
      anti-PD -1 monoclonal antibody hopefully can prolong patient survival. This trial will&#xD;
      evaluate the effectiveness and safety of carrelizumab combined with microwave ablation and&#xD;
      chemotherapy in the treatment of colorectal cancer liver metastasis/pulmonary metastasis&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase II, single-arm prospective trial of local ablation combined with chemotherapy&#xD;
      and camrelizumab for liver metastasis/pulmonary metastasis in colorectal cancer. The enrolled&#xD;
      patients received ablation of liver metastases/pulmonary metastasis first, followed by&#xD;
      chemotherapy (standard treatment plan for advanced colorectal cancer, determined by the&#xD;
      investigator) and camrelizumab treatment (200mg, iv, q3w) one week later. If the patient has&#xD;
      multiple metastatic tumors, ablation therapy needs to be performed in multiple times.&#xD;
      Sequential chemotherapy and camrelizumab is administered one week after each ablation&#xD;
      therapy. Treatment will continue until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or&#xD;
      voluntary patient withdrawal.&#xD;
