    <textblock>
      Objective: The aim of this study is to evaluate whether the exposure of oxidative stres in&#xD;
      the peroperative period and the postoperative 24th hour can be decreased with the&#xD;
      thiol-disulfide homeostasis (TDH) method and C-Reactive Protein (CRP) with intravenous&#xD;
      ibuprofen used for postoperative analgesia in patients undergoing total laparoscopic&#xD;
      hysterectomy Material and Method: Sixty-nine patients with American Society of&#xD;
      Anesthesiologists (ASA) scores I and II who scheduled for laparoscopic hysterectomy were&#xD;
      included in the study. The patients were randomly divided into two groups as ibuprofen and&#xD;
      paracetamol (Group IP) and paracetamol (Group P) with the sealed envelope method. When the&#xD;
      vascular access was established from all patients (T0), after blood was drawn for TDH and CRP&#xD;
      measurements, while 30-minute lasting iv infusion of 800 mg ibuprofen diluted with 0,9%&#xD;
      isotonic and iv infusion of 1 g paracetamol was started simultaneously, only 1g of&#xD;
      paracetamol infusion was administered in Group P. In the IP group 800 mg ibuprofen and 1 g&#xD;
      paracetamol, in the P group only paracetamol, the medicines specified for each group&#xD;
      administered intravenously every 6 hours. The postoperative pain level in the patients was&#xD;
      evaluated at the 1st, 2nd, 6th, 12th and 24th hours with the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS).&#xD;
      Rescue analgesia with 1mg/kg tramadol as an iv bolus was applied to patients whose VAS score&#xD;
      was 4 and above. Other blood samples for CRP and TDH were taken before insufflation (T1),&#xD;
      after desufflation (T2) and at the postoperative 24th hour (T3). Demographic and hemodynamic&#xD;
      data of the patients, duration of anesthesia and Trendelenburg position, need for additional&#xD;
      analgesia, presence of nausea and vomiting, VAS scores, pathology results, CRP and TDH levels&#xD;
      were recorded.&#xD;
