      Feasibility and safety study of the alfapump DSR system in the treatment of volume overloaded&#xD;
      heart failure subjects receiving high doses of loop diuretics. Up to 24 subjects will be&#xD;
      enrolled in up to 3 centres in Republic of Georgia, and randomized into 2 parallel treatment&#xD;
      arms. Once implanted with the alfapump DSR system they will undergo DSR therapy in 2 phases:&#xD;
      intensive treatment phase followed by maintenance treatment phase.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The feasibility trial will consist of a 24-subject randomized study in volume overloaded&#xD;
      heart failure subjects receiving high dose of loop diuretics. Subjects providing consent for&#xD;
      participating in the clinical trial will be screened for eligibility. Once eligibility is&#xD;
      confirmed they will be implanted with the alfapump® and a standard peritoneal infusion port.&#xD;
      After the implant, the subject will undergo a 40 mg IV furosemide (or 1 mg IV bumetanide)&#xD;
      diuretic challenge with timed biospecimen collection. At the start of the study treatment&#xD;
      period, the loop diuretics treatment will be stopped. Subjects will be randomized in an&#xD;
      unblinded fashion into one of two groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group 1 (N= 12) - treatment with a standard dose of SGLT2-inhibitor, combined with DSR&#xD;
           treatment (PRN use of loop diuretics)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group 2 (N= 12) - treatment with DSR treatment (PRN use of loop diuretics) Enrolled&#xD;
           subjects in both groups will undergo at least two weeks of intensive alfapump® DSR&#xD;
           treatment (Phase 1) followed by a maintenance and follow-up period of 16 weeks (Phase&#xD;
           2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      During Phase 1 (this can be an in-patient or an out-patient setting, depending on the local&#xD;
      standard of care practices), DSR treatment will be performed in the hospital for each subject&#xD;
      with the baseline treatment regimen being 1L 10% dextrose (DSR infusate) with a two-hour&#xD;
      dwell time. During this phase 1 period, there will be 2 subsequent treatment intensities:&#xD;
      Phase 1a) Active weight reduction and Phase 1b) Weight stabilization. The active weight&#xD;
      reduction phase (phase 1a) will start with 3 consecutive daily DSR treatment visits in all&#xD;
      subjects. Three consecutive daily visits are required to determine the subsequent DSR&#xD;
      treatment frequency and dose. Prior to each planned DSR treatment, the subject is evaluated&#xD;
      (weight, vital signs, and physical exam) and blood analysis is performed. Pending this&#xD;
      evaluation, the next DSR treatment may be held, reduced (down-titrated) or escalated&#xD;
      (up-titration) based on the proposed titration guidelines and at the discretion of the study&#xD;
      physician. These titration guidelines differ depending on the (sub)treatment phase(s).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before the end of the 2 intensive weeks (phase 1), many subjects may become already euvolemic&#xD;
      and may transition from the active weight loss phase (1a) to the weight stabilization dosing&#xD;
      phase (1b). The transition to phase 1b is based on either the resolution of signs and&#xD;
      symptoms of volume overload and physician opinion of euvolemia or on the worsening of&#xD;
      creatinine by 0.5mg/dL or 1.5x the subject's baseline serum creatinine. The dosing of DSR&#xD;
      will employ identical steps as before, but the titration guidelines are adapted in order to&#xD;
      stabilize the weight in phase 1b (rather than continue to lose weight).&#xD;
&#xD;
      After 2 weeks of DSR (end of phase 1), the subject's condition will be evaluated via a&#xD;
      diuretic challenge before entering the Phase 2 maintenance phase of the study. Transition to&#xD;
      Phase 2 is recommended if all of the following criteria are met&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Clinical euvolemia is achieved (clinical assessment by investigator);&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Diuretic response during diuretic challenge is &gt;200mmol Na or 50% increase or 50 mmol Na&#xD;
           increase from baseline&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Stable DSR dosing was achieved If these criteria are not met, it is recommended that a&#xD;
           2nd 2-week Phase 1 period is utilized. To ensure ease of enrolment and compliance with&#xD;
           the protocol, this is a recommendation rather than a protocol mandate. Up to three&#xD;
           2-week Phase 1 periods (6 weeks total) are allowable per protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During phase 2 all subjects will receive DSR using 1L of D10 in a monthly maintenance&#xD;
      treatment session. In case a subject exhibits weight gain greater than 2.5kg or 50% than the&#xD;
      weight at the end of Phase 1, loop diuretics (bumetanide, chosen for its short half-life,&#xD;
      thus minimizing the time each day the kidney is exposed to loop diuretics) may be started&#xD;
      using a proposed dosing schedule. The maintenance phase will last 4 months after subject has&#xD;
      started this phase 2. Total maximum study duration (screening until end of phase 2) for each&#xD;
      subject will be 6,5 months. During the maintenance period, subjects will be followed weekly&#xD;
      (hospital visit or telephone call). Subjects who relapse to congestion state will be&#xD;
      undergoing additional active DSR treatment in dose and frequency as deemed required per their&#xD;
      clinical needs by treating physician, until decongested state is reached again. In case a&#xD;
      subject present with repeat symptoms of volume overload or decongestion, which would&#xD;
      necessitate a repeat of phase I treatment, this will not prolong initial 4 months duration of&#xD;
      phase 2. The recurrent decongestion will need to be reported as (S)AE and will be followed up&#xD;
      until resolution. At the end of the phase 2 phase, each subject undergoes a diuretic&#xD;
      challenge to evaluate diuretic response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of the phase 2 phase, subjects may elect to keep the alfapump® DSR system&#xD;
      implanted, in agreement with the investigator. After consenting, subjects can participate in&#xD;
      an extended follow-up with or without DSR treatments until the end of the alfapump® DSR&#xD;
      system lifecycle (expected maximum 2 years). In other indications (not DSR) where the&#xD;
      alfapump® is implanted, an average pump lifecycle of 10 months is observed. During the&#xD;
      extended follow up period, no replacement of alfapump®, peritoneal access port or alfapump&#xD;
      catheters will be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of the extended follow-up is to collect more long-term safety data. For&#xD;
      subjects for whom DSR therapy appears to be offering a benefit, the investigator can elect to&#xD;
      offer continued monthly DSR treatment at his/her discretion, in close collaboration with&#xD;
      scientific study management team. Subjects participating in this extended follow-up will be&#xD;
      asked to perform an additional diuretic challenge every 3 months during the extended FU to&#xD;
      evaluate their diuretic response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects not participating in the proposed study extension as well as subjects who elected to&#xD;
      have the alfapump® explanted at the end of the phase 2, will be proposed to participate in a&#xD;
      minimal extended follow-up to allow investigator to contact them monthly to gather&#xD;
      information only on loop diuretic restart and dose after the end of the study (with a maximum&#xD;
      of 1 year after the end of phase 2 treatment period).&#xD;
