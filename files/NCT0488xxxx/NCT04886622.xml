      A Phase 1, Open-Label, Dose Escalation, and Cohort Expansion Study to Evaluate the Safety,&#xD;

      This study is an open-label, first-in-human, dose escalation study in subjects with&#xD;
      histologically or cytologically confirmed advanced or metastatic malignancies who are no&#xD;
      longer responsive to approved or accepted standard-of-care interventions. The study will&#xD;
      consist of a dose escalation phase followed by confirmation of the recommended phase 2 dose&#xD;
      (RP2D).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Potentially eligible subjects will undergo screening evaluations (up to 28 days prior to&#xD;
      study therapy) and those who meet all protocol-defined eligibility criteria will be enrolled&#xD;
      into the study. Subjects who fail screening may be re-screened one time following correction&#xD;
      or mitigation of the condition that caused the screen failure; there is no time limit on when&#xD;
      a subject may be re-screened. Enrolled subjects will receive a single intravenous (IV)&#xD;
      infusion of study drug on Days 1 and 4 weekly for at least 4 weeks, with each cycle&#xD;
      consisting of 28 days. Treatment duration for an individual subject may continue for a&#xD;
      maximum of 1 year, until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, subject withdrawal,&#xD;
      Investigator's decision for a change in treatment strategy for the individual subject, or&#xD;
      death. Longer therapy may be considered for individual subjects upon consultation with the&#xD;
      Sponsor's Medical Monitor and overall assessment of benefit:risk. Subjects will be followed&#xD;
      for safety for 28 days following the administration of the last study treatment.&#xD;
