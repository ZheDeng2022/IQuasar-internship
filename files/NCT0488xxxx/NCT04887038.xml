  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is phase 1 first-in-human trial evaluating SRT-015 to assess safety, tolerability and&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics. This study will be conducted in 3 parts - SAD, MAD and Food Effect with&#xD;
      target of 96 healthy volunteers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This will be a single center, Phase 1, randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled, SAD and&#xD;
      MAD study of dose escalation cohorts evaluating administration of SRT-015 or placebo.&#xD;
      Additionally, PK will be assessed in fed and fasting states.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will be divided into three parts:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part A: SAD- Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled single oral escalating dose of&#xD;
      SRT-015 or placebo in five cohorts (A1-A5). Each cohort will include 8 healthy subjects (6&#xD;
      randomized to receive SRT-015 and 2 to receive placebo). Two subjects from each cohort (1 to&#xD;
      receive SRT-015 and 1 to receive placebo) will be dosed as sentinels, with the remainder of&#xD;
      the subjects of each cohort (5 to receive SRT-015 and 1 to receive placebo) dosed at least&#xD;
      the following day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An extension cohort (Cohort A6) will allow investigation of a repeat or intermediate dose, at&#xD;
      the discretion of the Sponsor or Safety Review Committee (SRC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part B: MAD- Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled multiple oral escalating dose of&#xD;
      SRT-015 or placebo in four cohorts (B1-B4). Each cohort will include 8 healthy subjects (6&#xD;
      randomized to receive SRT-015 and 2 to receive placebo). Subjects will be treated with&#xD;
      SRT-015 or placebo for 7 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An extension cohort (Cohort B5) will allow investigation of a repeat or intermediate dose at&#xD;
      the discretion of Sponsor and SRC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part C: Food Effect (FE)- Randomized, crossover oral SRT-015 dose study of 8 healthy adults&#xD;
      divided into two concurrent groups where half (n=4) of the subjects (Cohort C1) will receive&#xD;
      the first dose as an oral suspension in fasting state on Day 1 of Period 1, the second dose&#xD;
      as capsule formulation in fasting state on Day 1 of Period 2 and the third dose as a capsule&#xD;
      formulation in a fed state on Day 1 of Period 3. The remainder (n=4) of the subjects (Cohort&#xD;
      C2) will receive the first dose as an oral suspension in fasting state on Day 1 of Period 1,&#xD;
      the second dose as a capsule formulation in a fed state on Day 1 of Period 2 and the third&#xD;
      dose as a capsule formulation in a fasting state on Day 1 of Period 3.&#xD;
