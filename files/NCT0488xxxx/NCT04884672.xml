  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this PMCF investigation is to systematically collect safety and&#xD;
      effectiveness data with the VISUMAX 800 laser in clinical daily routine SMILE use for the&#xD;
      purpose of post market surveillance.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The present PMCF study is a prospective, non-randomized, international multi-center study&#xD;
      without control group including patients with myopia or myopia combined with astigmatism&#xD;
      undergoing SMILE with the VISUMAX 800 femtosecond laser in daily routine use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this PMCF study, at maximum 474 eyes of consecutive subjects will be consented, enrolled,&#xD;
      treated and followed up to 6 months postoperatively at 4 to 5 sites. The treatments, which&#xD;
      will be done bilateral, shall be equally distributed between the sites as far as possible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The subjects will be 18 years of age or older, who suffer from myopia of up to -10 D with or&#xD;
      without astigmatism of up to 5 D, and are suitable for SMILE treatments, fulfil all inclusion&#xD;
      criteria and not fulfil any of the exclusion criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The expected duration of the is 16 months (site initiation to closeout visit).&#xD;
