  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The reproductive tract microecology is an important part of the human microbial system.&#xD;
      Microorganisms and the host reproductive tract environment form a stable symbiotic&#xD;
      relationship. When pathogens invade or microecology imbalance，it can lead to serious&#xD;
      reproductive tract infection.Reproductive tract infection is one of the most common disease&#xD;
      among women，and it is a global social and public health problem. Reproductive tract infection&#xD;
      is characterized by high morbidity, low cure rate and high recurrence rate.Data from the&#xD;
      studies shows that 40% of Chinese women suffer from reproductive tract infections of varying&#xD;
      degrees, that is, at least 200 million. Long-term chronic infections can lead to serious&#xD;
      consequences such as infertility, tumor, abortion and premature birth. At present, the&#xD;
      diagnostic classification of reproductive tract infection is mainly divided into Aerobic&#xD;
      vaginitis（AV), Bacterial vaginosis（BV), Vulvovaginal candidiasis（VVC) and Trichomonas&#xD;
      vaginitis（TV). The reproductive tract microbiota is complex, but the clinical classification&#xD;
      is relatively simple, which makes the treatment lack of precision. More precise&#xD;
      treatment，permanent cure and reducing the recurrence rate are the top priorities in the field&#xD;
      of medical and health.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      At present, the treatment of vaginitis is dominated by anti-pathogen medicine. While killing&#xD;
      pathogenic microorganisms, it also inhibits the growth of normal vaginal lactobacillus, which&#xD;
      further aggravates the vaginal microecological imbalance and makes it the root of refractory,&#xD;
      drug-resistant and recurrent reproductive tract infections.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A growing number of studies show that the key point of the treatment for reproductive tract&#xD;
      infections is to adjust the proportion of vaginal microorganism composition, in order to&#xD;
      achieve the initial Lactobacillus dominant state, and maintaining the balance of vaginal&#xD;
      microecology .&#xD;
&#xD;
      The composition and proportion of microorganisms in the lower reproductive tract influenced&#xD;
      by a variety of factors, such as changes in sex hormone levels and phases of the menstrual&#xD;
      cycle, sexual activity, antibiotic treatment and use of oral contraceptives, vaginal&#xD;
      irrigation, menopause, pregnancy, breastfeeding, diabetes and stress . Also, there are&#xD;
      obvious differences between different ethnicities and regions . Therefore, we need to conduct&#xD;
      correlation analysis on the microbiota structure and various indicators of the Chinese&#xD;
      population, and develop a more reasonable method for classifying lower reproductive tract&#xD;
      infections and treatments. According to this classification method, accurate diagnosis of&#xD;
      vaginal disease is further carried out, more rational treatment options can be&#xD;
      implemented，and the health of patients is effectively improved.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on the above background, the study collected DNA from vaginal secretions from about&#xD;
      10,000 healthy Chinese women of reproductive age. And the DNA was tested by next genetic&#xD;
      sequencing.The data obtained in this project will establish the baseline of the lower&#xD;
      reproductive tract microbiome of Chinese population, and will be used for future research and&#xD;
      comparison. The results will be used to explore the comparison of the lower reproductive&#xD;
      tract flora of the population in different regions of China, and of the Chinese population&#xD;
      with other ethnicities worldwide.&#xD;
