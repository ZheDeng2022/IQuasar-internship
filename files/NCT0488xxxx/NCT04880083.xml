  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a non-randomized, single-arm, open-label, prospective interventional study using a&#xD;
      commercially available starter infant formula in healthy term formula-fed infants with a&#xD;
      parallel group of healthy term breast-fed infants as reference group. Approximately 120 male&#xD;
      and female infants (60 per group) who are 3-28 days old and are exclusively or predominately&#xD;
      formula-feeding or breastfeeding will be enrolled.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Breastmilk contains an abundance of structurally diverse compounds having important&#xD;
      physiologic roles. These include glycoproteins which are biologically active and involved in&#xD;
      infant gut, immune and brain development (Jiang and Lönnerdal 2016).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The overall purpose of this study is to study the effectiveness of a term infant formula rich&#xD;
      in glycoprotein (formula-fed group) on gastrointestinal tolerance, and gastrointestinal&#xD;
      health in healthy term infants compared to a breast-fed reference group. We hypothesize that&#xD;
      there will be comparable gastrointestinal tolerance in formula-fed and breast-fed and that&#xD;
      fecal bifidobacteria changes in early infancy in the formula-fed group are similar to that of&#xD;
      breast-fed infants.&#xD;

    <measure>Overall gastrointestinal (GI) tolerance</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 39-45</time_frame>
    <description>Compare the overall gastrointestinal (GI) tolerance between the formula-fed and the breast-fed infants from enrolment to 6 weeks of intervention.&#xD;
Assessed through the IGSQ-13 (Infant Gastrointestinal Symptoms Questionnaire). The IGSQ-13, consisting of 13 questions, is a retrospective, standardized, validated, questionnaire of GI symptoms and related behaviors that the infant experienced over the past week from a parent's perspective. Overall GI tolerance is assessed from the IGSQ index score, computed from the 13 questions. Possible scores range from 13 - 65, with lower scores representing lower overall GI burden.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Evidence of personally signed and dated informed consent document indicating that the&#xD;
             infant's parent(s)/ legally accepted representatives LAR have been informed of all&#xD;
             pertinent aspects of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Infants whose parent(s)/LAR have reached the legal age of majority in the countries&#xD;
             where the study is conducted.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Infants whose parent(s)/LAR are willing and able to comply with scheduled visits, and&#xD;
             the requirements of the study protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Infants whose parent(s)/LAR can be contacted directly by telephone throughout the&#xD;
             study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Infants whose parent(s)/LAR have a working freezer.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Infants must meet all the following inclusion criteria to be eligible for enrolment&#xD;
             into the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Healthy term infant (37-42 weeks of gestation).&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  At enrolment visit, post-natal age 3-28 days (date of birth = day 0)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Birth weight ≥ 2500g and ≤ 4500g.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Formula-fed infants only: Infants must predominantly consume and tolerate a&#xD;
                  standard cow's milk infant formula prior to enrolment and their parent(s)/LAR&#xD;
                  must have independently elected, before enrolment, not to exclusively breastfeed.&#xD;
                  Predominantly formula feeding means that the infant's predominant source of&#xD;
                  nourishment has been formula. Specifically, infants are fed with formula for at&#xD;
                  least 75% of total milk feeds per day.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Breastfed infants only: Infants must have been predominantly breastfed since&#xD;
                  birth, and their parent(s)/LAR must have made the decision to continue&#xD;
                  predominant breastfeeding for the duration of the study. Predominant&#xD;
                  breastfeeding allows infants to be mix fed with breastmilk and other milks. It&#xD;
                  means that the infant's predominant source of nourishment has been breastmilk.&#xD;
                  Specifically, infants are fed with breast milk for at least 75% of total milk&#xD;
                  feeds per day.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Infants with conditions requiring infant feedings other than those specified in the&#xD;
             protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Infants receiving complementary foods or liquids defined as 4 or more teaspoons per&#xD;
             day or approximately 20 g per day of complementary foods or liquids at or prior to&#xD;
             enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Infants who have a medical condition or history that could increase the risk&#xD;
             associated with study participation or interfere with the interpretation of study&#xD;
             results, including:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Evidence of major congenital malformations (e.g., cleft palate, extremity&#xD;
                  malformation).&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Documented systemic or congenital infections (e.g., human immunodeficiency virus,&#xD;
                  cytomegalovirus, syphilis).&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Previous or ongoing severe medical or laboratory abnormality (acute or chronic)&#xD;
                  which, in the judgment of the investigator, would make the infant inappropriate&#xD;
                  for entry into the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Infants who are presently receiving or have received prior to enrollment probiotic&#xD;
             supplements or any of the following: medication(s) or supplement(s) which are known or&#xD;
             suspected to affect the following: fat digestion, absorption, and/or metabolism (e.g.,&#xD;
             pancreatic enzymes); stool characteristics and microbiota (e.g., oral and systemic&#xD;
             antibiotics, glycerin suppositories, bismuth-containing medications, docusate,&#xD;
             Maltsupex, or lactulose); growth (e.g. insulin or growth hormone); gastric acid&#xD;
             secretion.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Currently participating or having participated in another clinical trial since birth.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Subjects or subjects' parent(s) or legal representative who are not willing and not&#xD;
             able to comply with scheduled visits and the requirements of the study protocol.&#xD;
