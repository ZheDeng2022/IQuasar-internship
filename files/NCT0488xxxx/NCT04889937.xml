    <textblock>
      Single-site non-significant risk, open-label clinical investigation designed to validate the&#xD;
      usability, adherence, and preliminary diagnostic performance of a novel technology to detect&#xD;
      neutropenia. Study participants will be managed as per the standard of care practice with a&#xD;
      baseline and nadir visit including laboratory determinations. They will also be evaluated&#xD;
      with the device at both time points and with daily measurements during the two-week period in&#xD;
      between.&#xD;

    <description>An exploratory analysis about the number of days before the second lab determination that PointCheckTM detected severe neutropenia will be investigated in those participants with severe neutropenia at the nadir visit. Also, exploratory analysis will be conducted in patients developing febrile neutropenia (axillary temperature ≥100.4°F and grade III/IV neutropenia documented in the lab report) during the study to evaluate how many days before the appearance of fever the device detected severe neutropenia during the at home phase of the study.</description>

    <description>PointCheckTM is intended for use to aid in the assessment of severe neutropenia in the home or clinic setting in subjects receiving myelosuppressive chemotherapy with intermediate to high febrile neutropenia risk. The device non-invasively captures real-time videos of blood flow in the nailfold microcirculation and utilizes visible light, a microscope and a computer vision software to provide a qualitative result. The device is limited to use as a preliminary assessment tool in conjunction with standard of care, including temperature monitoring and clinical assessment. It is not to be used as a stand-alone determinant of severe neutropenia or for any other diagnostic purpose</description>

        The study will be conducted in children, and young adults diagnosed with lymphomas that&#xD;
        require cytotoxic chemotherapies that could lead to febrile neutropenia. We encourage to&#xD;
        enroll patients with Diffuse Large B-Cell Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma (DLBCL) who are scheduled to&#xD;
        receive cytotoxic chemotherapy agents with high (&gt;20%) or intermediate (10-20%) risk of&#xD;
        neutropenia (Becker et al. 2019). However, all patients with Hodgkin and Non-Hodgkin&#xD;
        Lymphoma whose therapy has an intermediate or high risk of febrile neutropenia, are&#xD;
        eligible. The main factor to select the populations will therefore be the estimated risk of&#xD;
        severe neutropenia of the chemotherapy used. Patients under any other regimen that have an&#xD;
        associated FN risk greater than 10% will be considered eligible.&#xD;
