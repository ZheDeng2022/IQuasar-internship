    <textblock>
      The main objective of the present study is to describe the quality of life of patients under&#xD;
      25 years of age with pediatric-onset IBD. The quality of life will be described according to&#xD;
      the age and the activity of the disease in order to make it possible to associate with the&#xD;
      different states of health a measure of quality of life (utility score) from utility values&#xD;
      established in the French context. These data are essential for the realization of&#xD;
      medico-economic models.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The continuous increase in incidence of chronic inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) will&#xD;
      increase their burden on health care costs in the future. Pediatric IBD is frequently&#xD;
      associated with an aggressive phenotype causing specific complications (undernutrition,&#xD;
      pubertal delay or height-weight loss) and has a long-term impact on quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therapeutic evolutions were marked in the 1990s by the arrival of immunosuppressants and then&#xD;
      in the 2000s of biotherapies (anti-TNF).To limit the accumulation of tissue damage and to&#xD;
      benefit from the maximum effectiveness of anti -TNF, clinicians are tempted to offer early&#xD;
      treatment of CD with anti-TNF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An ongoing study using data from the EPIMAD registry aims to study the impact of therapies on&#xD;
      the disease course of patients with IBD in their childhood (Inspired study). This study also&#xD;
      contains a medico-economic component, the objective of which is to evaluate the&#xD;
      cost-effectiveness of the different management strategies for pediatric onset IBD. As part of&#xD;
      this economic study, quality of life data will be needed. Indeed, there are very few data on&#xD;
      quality of life in children / adolescents with IBD in the literature. These data must be&#xD;
      collected from patients, unlike the other data used (retrospective data, in medical records).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective of the present study is to describe the quality of life of patients under&#xD;
      25 years of age with pediatric-onset IBD. The quality of life will be described according to&#xD;
      the age and the activity of the disease in order to make it possible to associate with the&#xD;
      different states of health a measure of quality of life (utility score) from utility values&#xD;
      established in the French context. These data are essential for the realization of&#xD;
      medico-economic models.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will supplement data currently being collected from patients over 25 years of age,&#xD;
      quality of life being the subject of a secondary objective of a study on the professional&#xD;
      integration of patients with IBD (PROMICI study , ID-RCB: 2017-A03397-46).&#xD;
