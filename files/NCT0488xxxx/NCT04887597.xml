      The purpose of this Phase IV study is to determine the effect of secukinumab on total immune&#xD;
      cell numbers obtaines by entheseal biopsy in the inflamed human entheses in patients with&#xD;
      Psoriatic Arthritis. This is a single arm, single centre, prospective, open label study with&#xD;
      secukinumab.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Psoriatic arthritis (PsA) is a heterogeneous inflammatory rheumatologic disorder&#xD;
      characterized by inflammatory arthritis, enthesitis, dactylitis and spondylitis, affecting 6%&#xD;
      to 39% of the patients suffering from psoriasis. The exact prevalence of PsA is unknown.&#xD;
      Estimates of incidence vary from 0.3% to 1% of the population. Disease onset typically occurs&#xD;
      between the ages of 30 and 55 years, and affects both genders equally. PsA is classified as a&#xD;
      seronegative spondyloarthropathy (SpA) because it shares certain features with other&#xD;
      conditions included in that group. Indeed, spinal involvement has been reported in&#xD;
      approximately 50% of patients with PsA. In addition, PsA is associated with enthesitis and&#xD;
      dactylitis, which are extra-articular features common to SpA. Finally, the majority of&#xD;
      patients with PsA are negative for the rheumatoid factor. Recent studies have challenged the&#xD;
      assertion that PsA is a more benign disease than rheumatoid arthritis. There is an increasing&#xD;
      body of evidence that suggests that PsA patients experience progressive joint destruction&#xD;
      over a relatively short period of time. The results from these studies indicate that PsA is&#xD;
      erosive and deforming in nearly half of the patients, with joint damage appearing in the&#xD;
      first years of disease onset. Other investigators later confirmed that 41% of the patients&#xD;
      developed erosive disease within 2 years of onset of symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Diagnosis and treatment as early as possible has become the standard of care in rheumatoid&#xD;
      arthritis in order to prevent disease progression, irreversible functional impairment and&#xD;
      premature death. Since the 1970s, it has also been recognized that each inflammatory lesion&#xD;
      (joint synovitis, tenosynovitis, dactylitis, enthesitis, sacroiliitis, and spondylitis) can&#xD;
      develop without symptoms or signs that are recognizable by the patient and the physician.&#xD;
      Such patients can be considered to have subclinical or &quot;occult&quot; PsA. Support for this notion&#xD;
      comes from imaging studies providing evidence for the existence of subclinical inflammatory&#xD;
      changes in patients with psoriatic skin disease using MRI or high-resolution ultrasound&#xD;
      scans.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators focused on the concept of &quot;pre-clinical&quot; changes in their own observational&#xD;
      study. Patients suffering from psoriasis with no present or past signs of joint&#xD;
      manifestations to stringently rule out clinical joint involvement, have been investigated.&#xD;
      The investigators recently described that patients with psoriasis, but without PsA, exhibit&#xD;
      entheseophytes as the result of pathological bone formation in the joints as a pathological&#xD;
      hallmark of PsA. Recent work has identified enthesial pathology as a specific part of the PsA&#xD;
      disease process. Entheses may represent the primary site of musculoskeletal changes in&#xD;
      psoriasis patients developing PsA. In particular, the understanding of enthesial structures&#xD;
      as an organ with a high degree of structural and functional organisation and the coining of&#xD;
      the term 'synovio-entheseal complex' have extended the view on PsA. These concepts are of&#xD;
      potential importance in searching for the discrete changes of the joints in patients with&#xD;
      psoriatic skin disease. This finding reinforces the pathophysiological role of the entheses&#xD;
      in patients with psoriatic disease. Apparently, enthesial changes can occur in the sole&#xD;
      presence of skin disease and do not require the clinical arthritis corroborating the concept&#xD;
      of an intrinsic clinical connection between the skin and the entheses, which has been&#xD;
      previously suggested by molecular studies referring to the role of interleukin-23 as a linker&#xD;
      between skin and enthesial pathology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the peripheral joints, entheses can be found at the attachment of the collateral ligaments&#xD;
      and the circumferential insertion of the capsule itself, which are also known as&#xD;
      'synovio-entheseal complexes' and are highly prone to structural bone changes. Furthermore,&#xD;
      functional entheses exist at the dorsal and palmar sites of the MCHs serving as pulleys for&#xD;
      the extensor and flexor tendons, respectively. Importantly, these mechanically exposed&#xD;
      locations were identical with the sites of new bone formation, suggesting a tight connection&#xD;
      between mechanical factors and the bone response observed in psoriasis patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Findings provide new evidence for the existence of a Deep Koebner Phenomenon at the enthesial&#xD;
      sites in psoriasis patients. In its original description, this phenomenon corresponds to the&#xD;
      trigger of inflammation and acro-osteolysis by a discrete traumatic injury. New findings&#xD;
      extend the concept of the Deep Koebner Phenomenon suggesting a pathological tissue response&#xD;
      to mechanical stress in psoriasis patients. This response affects the mechanically exposed&#xD;
      sites of the body, which are the skin and the entheses. The specific importance of&#xD;
      entheseophyte formation in psoriasis patients is also supported by the observation that the&#xD;
      burden of bone erosions was not significantly enhanced in psoriasis patients compared with&#xD;
      healthy controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Moreover enthesitis is a frequent manifestation in PsA and SpA. Dependent on studies between&#xD;
      23% and 70% of patients with PsA/SpA show enthesitis. Enthesitis is characterized by&#xD;
      inflammation at specific anatomical sites, where ligaments, tendons and joint capsules attach&#xD;
      to bone. The main clinical manifestations of enthesitis is pain while swelling is infrequent.&#xD;
      Pain can be severe, persistent and resistent to treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up-to-date no synovial or enthesial tissue biomarkers are available to stratify treatment&#xD;
      strategies in regard to an anti-inflammatory response to bDMARD therapies in active psoriatic&#xD;
      arthritis with enthesitis. Looking at other medical disciplines such as the oncology field,&#xD;
      where detailed histological, immunohistochemical and even genetic analysis of tumor tissue&#xD;
      for a personalized diagnostic, therapeutic and prognostic decision are performed, in&#xD;
      rheumatology (inflammatory discipline) we are still far from a personalized diagnostic,&#xD;
      therapeutic and prognostic approach based on tissue biomarker to better help and advice&#xD;
      patients. Fortunately, a growing variety of medications such as bDMARDs are available,&#xD;
      however investigators are still in a &quot;try and error&quot; situation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Obtaining and analyzing enthesial tissue biopsies prior and after treatment with an anti-IL17&#xD;
      monoclonal antibody (secukinumab) might allow the investigators to identify biomarkers for&#xD;
      treatment responses, using histological, immunohistochemical, molecular and flow cytometry&#xD;
      techniques to further add information to the understanding of inflammation and entheses&#xD;
      repair processes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Virtually all information on enthesitis to date is based on either preclinical models or the&#xD;
      clinical assessment of tender points in humans creating a huge unmet need for a better&#xD;
      understanding of human enthesitis. To date only one single biopsy study of enthesitis has&#xD;
      been carried out, which assessed acute enthesiopathy in peripheral SpA patients. In light of&#xD;
      the availability of drugs with high clinical efficacy on enthesitis, such as IL-17 blockers,&#xD;
      and the preclinical evidence for a role of the IL-23/IL-17 pathway in enthesitis, human&#xD;
      studies are needed to assess how and to what extent IL-17 inhibition ameliorates enthesitis.&#xD;
      Serum studies can hardly replace biopsy studies in this respect, since many of the processes&#xD;
      in enthesitis are local.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on this situation the investigators propose a combined biopsy-imaging study in patients&#xD;
      with PsA with active clinical enthesitis of the lateral epicondyle of the humerus or achilles&#xD;
      tendon. Patients will receive a 6-month treatment with secukinumab and the effect on&#xD;
      enthesial inflammation will be assessed by histology and mRNA assessment as well as combined&#xD;
      imaging.&#xD;

&#xD;
        Effective contraception methods include:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Total abstinence (when this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of the&#xD;
             patient. Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, postovulation&#xD;
             methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception;&#xD;
