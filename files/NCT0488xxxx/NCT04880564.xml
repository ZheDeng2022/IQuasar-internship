      The study is designed to investigate the safety, tolerability and preliminary efficacy in&#xD;
      combination with CN1 and CN401 in adult patients with relapsed/refractory lymphoid&#xD;
      malignancies.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, multi-center, phase I/II study. The study includes two study drugs CN1&#xD;
      and CN401 and will be conducted in two parts: phase 1 and phase 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase I: Dose-finding study for the assessment of dose limiting toxicities (DLTs) at 3 or&#xD;
      more dose levels in patients with advanced lymphoid malignancies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase II: Expansion study to evaluate the preliminary efficacy of CN1 in combination with&#xD;
      CN401 at the RP2D in parallel patient cohorts grouped by non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma (NHL)&#xD;
      subtype.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There will 9-18 patients enrolled in the Phase 1 portion of the study and 15- 60 patients&#xD;
      will be enrolled in Phase 2 - dosing determined by Phase 1.&#xD;
