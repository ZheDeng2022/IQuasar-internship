  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators believe that hospital readmissions for intermediate- to high-complexity&#xD;
      surgeries can be reduced by remote patient monitoring follow-up post-discharge, which&#xD;
      involves daily touchpoints with a clinical nurse, vital sign evaluation and a symptom&#xD;
      directed communication escalation process.&#xD;

    <description>Patients randomized to the remote monitoring arm will engage in a Connected Care Remote Patient Monitoring (RPM) Complex Care program. RPM Complex Care programs utilize established and standardized equipment, logistics/reverse logistic, engagement methods, and nursing clinical practice. Use of RPM Complex Care programs in this manner, is considered standard practice. Patients will be monitored for 30 days by the Connected Care nursing team as is standard for surgical RPM Complex Care programs.</description>

    <description>Subjects assigned to the Remote Care group will receive education from a clinical nurse from Mayo Clinic's Department of Connected Care on use of the equipment as part of Remote Monitoring. The equipment will be shipped along with instructions and Welcome Letter describing the Mayo Clinic Remote Patient Monitoring program. The Remote Patient Monitoring kit includes a digital tablet, a blood pressure cuff, a thermometer, a pulse oximeter, and a weight scale. Subjects will be contacted by phone at the end of the study to be instructed how to return the kit by mail.</description>
