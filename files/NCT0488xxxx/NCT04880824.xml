    <textblock>
      The patients included in PRÄP-GO and the corresponding comparison cohorts will be offered to&#xD;
      participate in this complementary study in order to be able to carry out a detailed&#xD;
      characterization and phenotyping of the frailty complex.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      As part of the innovation fund project PRÄP-GO (EA1/225/19), a multimodal intervention is&#xD;
      being conducted in patients with a frailty syndrome. However, the health care research&#xD;
      project is limited to evaluating clinical issues only. In order to be able to research&#xD;
      further pathophysiological, clinical, psychosocial and work-organizational connections,&#xD;
      different groups of participants will be offered the participation in this scientific support&#xD;
      program of PRÄP-GO.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The groups of participants in this accompanying program ANA-PRÄP-GO are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Randomized study patients with a frailty syndrome of the intervention study PRÄP-GO (PG&#xD;
           cohort)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Non-frail surgical control group (NFC cohort)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Non-operative control group (NO cohort)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants with health professions (GB cohort)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additionally, relatives of the patients can be included.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subprojects are included to reflect research questions of interest in sub groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Success of endoprosthetic implants (clinical outcome and gait pattern after total hip&#xD;
           arthroplasty and total knee arthroplasty in frail patients)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Functional treatment outcome and health-related quality of life after elective spinal&#xD;
           surgery in the PG cohort, in the NFC cohort, and in the NO cohort&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Hemodynamic evaluation in patients of the PG and NFC cohort with preoperative abnormal&#xD;
           cardiovascular function&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Establishment of a German standard database for 14 CANTAB tests by CANTAB Connect&#xD;
           technology&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Aggregated evaluation of the cognitive data of different anesthesiological study cohorts&#xD;
           to describe domain-specific changes in the perioperative course&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Perspectives of different health professional groups regarding necessary changes in&#xD;
           skill, organizational and management, and communication in interdisciplinary setting and&#xD;
           with patients and significant others.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Perspectives of patients and significant others regarding the organizational pathway of&#xD;
           the prehabilitation program&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Frequency, pathophysiology and trajectory of muscle weakness as well as functional&#xD;
           impairments of patients admitted to intensive care units of the PG and NFC cohort and&#xD;
           their long-term outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The gut microbiome as a potential risk factor for perioperative neurocognitive disorders&#xD;
           (PNDs) in the elderly&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluation of nutrition data in all cohorts (e.g. adherence to mediterranean diet,&#xD;
           nutrition habits, nutritional status etc.)&#xD;
