  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients are invited to participate in a trial to test a new way to optimise long-term use of&#xD;
      non-invasive ventilation using remote monitoring. Breathing difficulties during sleep are&#xD;
      frequently treated using home mechanical ventilation, also called non-invasive ventilation&#xD;
      (NIV). Breathing difficulties during sleep affect many patients with conditions such as&#xD;
      chronic pulmonary obstructive disease (COPD), neuromuscular conditions and obesity&#xD;
      hypoventilation syndrome. Left untreated they can cause breathlessness, headaches, sleepiness&#xD;
      and lead to hospitalisations and other severe adverse health outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The best available treatment for chronic types of sleep-disordered breathing is NIV. However,&#xD;
      not every patient eligible tolerates this treatment because it requires patients to sleep&#xD;
      with a nasal or full-face mask that is connected with a tube to a machine. Although NIV is&#xD;
      recommended by the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE), many&#xD;
      patients who should be on NIV use the treatment insufficiently within months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Using remote monitoring to identify problems with treatment adherence early on may help to&#xD;
      identify clinical problems, troubleshoot user- or device-dependent problems, avoid delays in&#xD;
      treatment and safe healthcare resources in the long-term.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators invite patients who use NIV to participate in this trial when they have&#xD;
      difficulties with the treatment (NIV). This study will evaluate compliance and efficacy of a&#xD;
      remote monitoring device (T4P device, SRETT, Paris/France) that will be connected to the&#xD;
      standard NIV machine to remotely monitor usage. Patients will be randomly assigned to the&#xD;
      remote monitoring using NIV for three months at home, or to usual care which is NIV without&#xD;
      this monitoring. The primary outcome measure of this study is the improvement in adherence&#xD;
      and compliance, as indicated by the average usage of NIV, as well as symptom scores to assess&#xD;
      treatment effects.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Participant Selection&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients established on NIV for &gt;3months will be recruited in this trial. The sample size&#xD;
      calculation of n=32 patients is based on previous in-house data (Ishak A et al, Respirology&#xD;
      2019 in press) to detect a difference in the treatment arms with a Power of &gt;80% and an alpha&#xD;
      of 5% using the improvement adherence as an outcome parameter.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Criteria and procedures for subject withdrawal or discontinuation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size estimation assumed 15-20% of patients would not provide end of study information&#xD;
      that could be evaluated. If this rate is observed, data for some patients will be only&#xD;
      partially observed. For patients who withdraw or drop out before the end of the study, the&#xD;
      &quot;no change assumption&quot; will be used to impute the missing subsequent values. This may&#xD;
      introduce a bias if the main reason for drop-out was deterioration. To examine this&#xD;
      possibility, sensitivity analysis will be performed to assess the primary efficacy outcome&#xD;
      using different imputation methods including &quot;best-case scenario&quot; and &quot;worst- case scenario&quot;&#xD;
      possible scores for the missing data. A second per protocol analysis, including only those&#xD;
      subjects with complete follow-up data will also be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subject Enrolment&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients on NIV will be recruited from the Lane Fox Unit at Guy's &amp; St Thomas' NHS Foundation&#xD;
      Trust where they are assessed in clinics. The Lane Fox Unit runs daily outpatient clinics at&#xD;
      the St Thomas' site. Currently, the Lane Fox Unit cares for &gt;2,000 patients on home&#xD;
      non-invasive ventilation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The direct care team will approach patients after consultation with the Consultant and hand&#xD;
      out a Patient Information Sheet to discuss the study with potential participants. Informed&#xD;
      written consent will be taken after sufficient time to allow for information and questioning.&#xD;
      Patients will then be offered a clinic date to come to hospital. If the patient fulfills all&#xD;
      inclusion and no exclusion criteria, follow up will be booked at 6- weeks (phone call) and at&#xD;
      12-weeks (clinic appointment) following randomisation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedures Informed Consent&#xD;
&#xD;
      A member of the direct clinical care team (Good Clinical Practice, GCP-trained) will take&#xD;
      informed consent once the patients have had the opportunity to read and discuss the Patient&#xD;
      Information Sheet with sufficient time. It will be clearly stated that the participant is&#xD;
      free to withdraw from the study at any time without this affecting any future care and with&#xD;
      no obligation to give the reason for withdrawal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following sufficient time and the opportunity to question the (Co-)investigator or other&#xD;
      independent parties to decide whether they will participate in the study written informed&#xD;
      consent will then be obtained. A copy of the signed informed consent will be given to the&#xD;
      participants. The original signed form will be kept at the study site and a copy will be&#xD;
      inserted in the medical notes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening and Eligibility Assessment&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with sleep-disordered breathing and the need for non-invasive ventilation will be&#xD;
      recruited from the Lane Fox Unit where they are assessed in the NIV clinics. The Lane Fox&#xD;
      Unit runs daily outpatient clinics at the St Thomas' site. Currently, the Lane Fox Unit cares&#xD;
      for &gt;2,000 patients on home non-invasive ventilation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The direct care team will approach patients after consultation with the Consultant and hand&#xD;
      out a Patient Information Sheet to discuss the study with them. Informed written consent will&#xD;
      be taken after sufficient time to allow for information and questioning. Patients will then&#xD;
      be offered a date to come to hospital within four weeks for the baseline. If the patient&#xD;
      fulfills all inclusion and no exclusion criteria, follow up will be booked at 6-weeks (phone&#xD;
      call) and at 12-weeks (clinic appointment) following randomisation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline Assessments&#xD;
&#xD;
      The initial assessment will include an outpatient clinic appointment. Patients will be&#xD;
      assessed using the following parameters:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Demographics i. Age ii. Gender iii. Height, Weight, Body-Mass-Index (BMI) iv. Neck&#xD;
           circumference v. Waist, Hip, W:H ratio vi. Mallampati and Friedman Score vii. Basic lung&#xD;
           function (spirometry: FEV1, FVC) viii. Blood pressure and heart rate ix. Medication use&#xD;
           x. GP appointments/A&amp;E contacts/hospitalisations (previous 3months)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Upper Airway i. Mallampati and Friedman score&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Blood tests i. Arterial or earlobe blood gas analysis (including pH, pO2, pCO2, HCO3-)&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Previous sleep study parameters, as measured when NIV was set up i. AHI/4%ODI ii.&#xD;
           average SpO2 (%) iii. Total recording time iv. Diagnosis&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Symptom and Quality of Life scores i. Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) ii. Stanford&#xD;
           Sleepiness Scale (SSS) iii. European Quality of Life tool (EQ-5D) iv. Hospital Anxiety&#xD;
           and Depression Scale (HADS) v. Severe Respiratory Insufficiency questionnaire (SRI)&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. NIV adherence i. total hours used ii. average usage per night (hours) iii. total nights&#xD;
           used&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomisation&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomisation and Home Treatment Following the baseline assessment, if eligible, patients&#xD;
      will be randomized into active treatment (remote monitoring of NIV) or usual care (NIV). The&#xD;
      active treatment will be remote monitoring at night while using NIV while the usual care&#xD;
      group will receive ongoing NIV therapy without remote monitoring.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomisation will involve assigning a unique patient number in sequential, ascending&#xD;
      chronological order (matched cases). This number will be a two-digit number prefixed by &quot;R&quot;&#xD;
      (e.g. R01, R02 etc) and will be used to identify the treatment the patient was randomised to.&#xD;
      Treatment assignment will be determined according to a computer generated randomisation list.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subsequent assessments&#xD;
&#xD;
      Weekly Review of Online Data In the intervention group, the investigators will review the&#xD;
      usage data weekly and, if it is found that the average usage for 3 subsequent nights is below&#xD;
      4 hours/night and/or the leak is &gt;50L/min then the patient will be called to discuss any&#xD;
      problems.&#xD;
&#xD;
      6-Week Telephone Contacts&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will receive a 6-week phone call to encourage NIV usage and discuss problems&#xD;
      with the treatment. Patients will be asked about comfort and adverse events. The following&#xD;
      parameters will be assessed:&#xD;
&#xD;
      i. Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) ii. Stanford Sleepiness Scale (SSS) iii. subjective NIV&#xD;
      usage (hours)&#xD;
&#xD;
      At this stage, the patients will be educated on the device/NIV again and encouraged to&#xD;
      continue with the usage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow up at 12-weeks&#xD;
&#xD;
      At 12-week follow up the patients will be invited to attend outpatient clinics at the Lane&#xD;
      Fox Unit. The assessment will repeat the following measurements (for more details see above,&#xD;
      7.4.3):&#xD;
&#xD;
      i) Demographics ii) Upper Airway iii) Blood tests iv) Symptom and Quality of Life scores v)&#xD;
      NIV usage&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be given a debriefing by the study team and individual study reports can be&#xD;
      requested at this stage, they will be provided once the entire analysis has been completed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Definition of End of Trial&#xD;
&#xD;
      The trial finishes with the 12-week follow up assessment. The patients will then be referred&#xD;
      back to standard care to be followed up in the outpatient setting at the Lane Fox Unit.&#xD;
