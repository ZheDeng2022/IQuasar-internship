    <textblock>
      Thoracic malignancy is the most commonly diagnosed cancer worldwide.1,2 The incidence of&#xD;
      thoracic malignancy has decreased in North America, but not in Asia, where it continues to&#xD;
      show an increasing trend. A notable manifestation of the bimodal age distribution of thoracic&#xD;
      malignancy has been observed in women. The occurrence of early-onset thoracic malignancy in&#xD;
      the Asian population is earlier than that in the Western population, resulting in a higher&#xD;
      incidence of thoracic malignancy in young Asian women. Moreover, the late onset age&#xD;
      distribution of patients with thoracic malignancy in Asia (40-50 years) is earlier than that&#xD;
      in Western countries (60-70 years), peaking at the age of 45-50 years in most women. The&#xD;
      age-specific incidence rates of thoracic malignancy increase sharply until the menopausal&#xD;
      stage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cardiovascular morbidity is higher among women with thoracic malignancy involving the thorax&#xD;
      who had received radiotherapy (RT) compared with those not involving the thorax but receiving&#xD;
      the same treatment. Thus far, the risks and time to onset of cardiac complications have been&#xD;
      unclear in both young and old women. The proportion of young women with thoracic malignancy&#xD;
      is higher in Asia than in Western countries. Furthermore, whether Asian women with thoracic&#xD;
      malignancy are susceptible to RT remains unclear.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anthracyclines are important therapeutic agents for breast cancer. Anthracycline-based&#xD;
      regimens have similar or improved outcomes relative to the standard treatment regimen of&#xD;
      cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, and fluorouracil. However, cardiotoxicity is a long-term&#xD;
      toxicity associated with these regimens. The combined use of adjuvant anthracycline-based&#xD;
      chemotherapy (CT) and RT may result in high cardiotoxicity. Nonetheless, no clear information&#xD;
      on the effects of this combined therapy on the time to onset of both cardiac complications&#xD;
      and cardiotoxicity is available. Furthermore, whether the cardiotoxicity of adjuvant RT and&#xD;
      anthracycline-based CT is associated with age and ethnicity in women with thoracic malignancy&#xD;
      remains unclear.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, cardiovascular disease is undoubtedly one of the most challenging health problems&#xD;
      in the world. More efforts are needed to prevent and better control of this disease. Our&#xD;
      proposed monitoring program is to use AI to monitor the basal value variation of personalized&#xD;
      cardiovascular disease in cancer patients before and after chemoradiation. In the first year,&#xD;
      our team focused on cardiotoxicity associated with cardiovascular disease models and cancer&#xD;
      treatments. In the second year, we will apply knowledge in a clinical setting and calculate&#xD;
      the severity of cardiac toxicity and its incidence and time response after cancer treatment.&#xD;
      In the third year, high-risk groups will be identified to provide preventive intervention to&#xD;
      reduce the risk of cancer-treatment related cardiotoxicity.&#xD;

      This study is open, prospective study, multi-center, randomized controlled trial, unobtrusive&#xD;
      research. This study is start on June 1 2021. And will include 400 patients who have just&#xD;
      cardiotoxicity of adjuvant RT and anthracycline-based CT patients who diagnosis of Thoracic&#xD;
      malignancy. And random allocation 200 experimental group (Non-invasive Wearable Device) and&#xD;
      200 control group (routine medical).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ask whether the patients who meet the exclusion criteria are willing to participate in the&#xD;
      screening (Screening), if they are willing to join and sign the consent of the subject, and&#xD;
      after the patient's condition is stable, conduct an electrocardiogram (V0) before discharge&#xD;
      from the hospital. On day 7 (±2 weeks), day 84 (±4 weeks), 168 days (±4 weeks), 252 days (±4&#xD;
      weeks), 336 days (±8 weeks) during routine clinical referral (V1-V5) Both are done once. The&#xD;
      results of these two tests and other basic information of the patient, including Demography,&#xD;
      Vital Signs, High, Weight, Medication, and European and Taiwan Cardiology Association&#xD;
      recommended routine test results of high-risk patients, including Blood Chemistry Panel,&#xD;
      NT-proBNP, Echocardiography, Myocardial Perfusion Scan, etc., will record the information of&#xD;
      the logged-in subjects on the paper case report form. The CRF only displays the study number,&#xD;
      and no subject is available. In addition to the examination of each return visit, the&#xD;
      subjects also took the ECG bracelet home at the time of discharge (V0) and wore it every day.&#xD;
      After the discharge, the ECG was measured every morning and evening, and their personal&#xD;
      activity and sleep were collected. Relevant information. After the subject was discharged&#xD;
      from the hospital, the subject tracked the date of all adverse events due to cardiovascular&#xD;
      disease within one year, including: heart failure, restenosis due to blood vessel, and&#xD;
      non-fatal myocardial infarction , To do blood vessel-related surgery again, and data on the&#xD;
      occurrence of death.&#xD;
