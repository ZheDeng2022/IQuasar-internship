    <textblock>
      Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a neuropsychiatric disorder characterized by recurrent&#xD;
      distressing thoughts and substantial anxiety, accompanied by repetitive behaviors or mental&#xD;
      rituals. Individuals with OCD often have diminished quality of life, and functional&#xD;
      impairment . The disorder cause high personal, societal and economic costs . Current&#xD;
      available treatments for OCD show moderate response rate and high rate of symptom relapse.&#xD;
      The purpose of the current study is to explore new alternative options for the treatment of&#xD;
      OCD that can widely and continuously benefit patients. Specifically, The aim of this study is&#xD;
      to investigate the feasibility, safety and efficacy of psychotherapy assisted psilocybin for&#xD;
      treatment of severe OCD. Previous research has shown safety of treatment and high efficacy in&#xD;
      reduction of anxiety and depression symptoms. However, only one study has evaluated the use&#xD;
      of psilocybin for OCD patients. The protocol includes 15 therapeutic sessions, of which 12&#xD;
      are one-hour sessions for psychological preparation and integration, and three are eight&#xD;
      hours' experiential sessions under the influence of psilocybin. The research will include 15&#xD;
      participants diagnosed with severe OCD, with at least one treatment failure. Assessments will&#xD;
      be based on comparing ratings of the main outcome measure (Y-BOCS), at baseline, at the&#xD;
      middle and at end of treatment. Other assessments will include data on side effects- to&#xD;
      evaluate safety, and possible spiritual variables underlying change in symptoms via&#xD;
      standardized questionnaires.&#xD;

      Background and research rationale:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a neuropsychiatric disorder characterized by recurrent&#xD;
      distressing thoughts and substantial anxiety, accompanied by repetitive behaviours or mental&#xD;
      rituals performed to control or alleviate this anxiety. Individuals with OCD often have&#xD;
      diminished quality of life, functional impairment , and cause substantial caregiver burden&#xD;
      and personal and societal economic costs. Lifetime prevalence of OCD ranges between&#xD;
      1.9%-2.5%, with patients often not responding to the offered pharmacological or psychological&#xD;
      treatment, and in extreme cases may even undergo neurosurgical interventions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are several possible physiological mechanisms leading to the development of OCD, which&#xD;
      may indicate several possible effective treatment options. Nowadays there is a consensus that&#xD;
      the dopaminergic and serotonergic pathways are central to the development of the disorder&#xD;
      with the basal ganglia as the main area of its origin. Other brain areas involved in OCD are&#xD;
      the orbitofrontal cortex and anterior cingulate cortex which are connected to the basal&#xD;
      ganglia and are involved in regulating attention and awareness. Abnormal activity between&#xD;
      these areas and other subcortical areas might explain why normally unconscious information&#xD;
      processing, becomes consciousness, and requires additional resources for its regulation. It&#xD;
      has also been suggested that the aversive emotional activity (anxiety, fear, disgust)&#xD;
      experienced in OCD, relates to hyperactivity in the amygdala. The momentary relief brought on&#xD;
      by the compulsive behaviour forms a positive feedback which perpetuate the disorder.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The gold standard of care for OCD today is a combination of selective serotonin reuptake&#xD;
      inhibitors (SSRIs) and cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT). Most patients will experience at&#xD;
      least some symptomatic relief with these interventions; however, relapse of symptoms occur in&#xD;
      40%-60% of patients and around 25% of patients are unresponsive to treatment . Other existing&#xD;
      treatments (either pharmacological or neurosurgical) possess a higher risk for serious side&#xD;
      effects. It is important to note that even for those patients who are responsive to treatment&#xD;
      there are still significant residual, impairing symptoms. It thus seems that there is a real&#xD;
      and immediate need to explore new alternative options for the treatment of OCD that can&#xD;
      widely and continuously benefit patients, with lower risk and fewer side effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A new and promising prospect of treatment in mental health is the use of psychedelic&#xD;
      substances, which interact with the serotonergic pathways and induce a powerful subjective&#xD;
      experience with the potential for psychological transformation. Specifically, psilocybin has&#xD;
      received attention in research as a promising alternative in the treatment of severe mental&#xD;
      illness. Psilocybin is a prodrug which is quickly converted by the body to psilocin&#xD;
      (4-OH-dimethyltryptamine), a 5-HT2A receptor partial agonist. Both psilocybin and psilocin,&#xD;
      which have psychoactive properties, are naturally occurring in Psilocybe mushrooms and are&#xD;
      structurally similar to the endogenous neurotransmitter serotonin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As a direct 5-HT2A agonist, psilocybin has a unique therapeutic potential compared with other&#xD;
      pharmacological treatment for OCD such as SSRIs. Animal studies have shown increased&#xD;
      cognitive flexibility, associative learning, cortical plasticity, and anti-depressive effects&#xD;
      in response to 5-HT2A activation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first current clinical research with psilocybin examined the safety and efficacy of&#xD;
      psilocybin in the treatment of psychological distress in patients with terminal&#xD;
      advanced-stage cancer. The double-blind, placebo-controlled research was conducted in the Los&#xD;
      Angeles Biomedical Research Institute, Harbor-UCLA Medical Center (Torrance, California).&#xD;
      Researchers concluded that psilocybin is safe and well tolerated at 0.2 mg/kg dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following this research two different research groups, in Johns Hopkins University, and in&#xD;
      New York University, have received FDA approval to administrate a higher dose of psilocybin&#xD;
      in a similar clinical population. These trails have shown promising results for safety,&#xD;
      psychological distress reduction, and significant improvement in anxiety and depression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In their research, Griffiths and colleagues, examined the efficacy of psilocybin in reducing&#xD;
      anxiety and depression in 51 patients suffering from a terminal end-stage cancer and&#xD;
      experiencing symptoms of anxiety and depression. This randomized, double-blind, cross-over&#xD;
      trial investigated the effects of a very low (placebo-like) dose (1 or 3 mg/70 kg) vs. a high&#xD;
      dose (22 or 30 mg/70 kg) of psilocybin. No serious adverse events attributed to psilocybin&#xD;
      administration occurred. There were transient moderate increases in systolic and/or diastolic&#xD;
      blood pressure after psilocybin (in 34% of participants in the high-dose session and 17% of&#xD;
      participants in the low-dose session), none of these episodes met criteria for medical&#xD;
      intervention. Nausea or vomiting occurred in 15% of participants in the high-dose session. An&#xD;
      episode of physical discomfort (any type) occurred in 21% of participants in the high-dose&#xD;
      session and 8% in the low-dose session. Psychological discomfort (any type) occurred in 32%&#xD;
      of participants in the high-dose session and 12% in the low-dose session. An episode of&#xD;
      anxiety occurred in 26% of participants in the high-dose session and 15% in the low-dose&#xD;
      session. One participant had a transient episode of paranoid ideation (2% of high-dose&#xD;
      sessions). There were no cases of hallucinogen persisting perception disorder (HPPD) or&#xD;
      prolonged psychosis. Across the two dose sequence groups, the overall rate of clinical&#xD;
      response at 6 months was 78% and 83% for depression and anxiety, respectively, and the&#xD;
      overall rate of symptom remission at 6 months for all participants was 65% and 57%,&#xD;
      respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ross and colleagues conducted a double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover trial, with 29&#xD;
      patients with cancer-related anxiety and depression that were randomly assigned and received&#xD;
      treatment with single-dose psilocybin (0.3 mg/kg) or niacin (active placebo), both in&#xD;
      conjunction with psychotherapy (before and after drug administration). The most common&#xD;
      adverse effects were non-clinically significant elevations in blood pressure and heart rate&#xD;
      (76%), headaches/migraines (28%), nausea (14%), transient anxiety (17%), and transient&#xD;
      psychotic-like symptoms (7%). The medical and psychiatric adverse effects attributable to&#xD;
      psilocybin are all known, were transient, and tolerable. There were no cases of prolonged&#xD;
      psychosis or HPPD, and no participants required psychiatric hospitalization. Psilocybin&#xD;
      produced immediate, substantial, and sustained improvements in anxiety and depression, this&#xD;
      effect was sustained at 6.5 months follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These trails and others have shown safety of treatment and high efficacy in reduction of&#xD;
      anxiety and depression symptoms with sustained effect at 6 months follow up. These findings&#xD;
      taken together with the theoretical understanding of psilocybin mechanism of action and with&#xD;
      the understanding of the neuro-psychological pathology of OCD, encourage investigating the&#xD;
      potential of psilocybin as a novel significant treatment for this disorder. Research of&#xD;
      beneficial effects of psilocybin for patients with OCD is in its infancy, but preliminary&#xD;
      findings show potential efficacy in treatment of the disorder.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Matsushima and colleagues, used a mice model for OCD and found that psilocybin (both&#xD;
      syntactic and in mushroom form), significantly inhibited compulsive behaviour (marble&#xD;
      burying) without affecting locomotor activity. In addition, several case reports showed&#xD;
      beneficial effects of psilocybin for people with OCD. For example, Leonard and Rapoport&#xD;
      (1987) and Moreno and Delgado (1997) reported that among drug-users with OCD, there was a&#xD;
      worsening of symptoms under the influence of cocaine, but a remission of symptoms for hours/&#xD;
      days following psilocybin use. Wilcox (2014) described a case in which a patient with OCD&#xD;
      self-medicated with psilocybin, once every three weeks, experienced a preserved effect of&#xD;
      reduced anxiety, obsessive thoughts, and compulsive behaviour. In another case report, a&#xD;
      patient suffering from a body dysmorphic disorder (spending about 4 hours a day examining&#xD;
      himself in the mirror), has experienced a significant reduction in distress and a notable&#xD;
      change in body perception following multiple dosing of psilocybin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Moreno et al. 2006 conducted a semi open-label trial examining the effect of psilocybin on&#xD;
      nine participants with mild to severe OCD, which had at least one &quot;treatment failure&quot; defined&#xD;
      as a lack of significant improvement after an adequate treatment. Doses were 25 (very low&#xD;
      dose [VLD]), 100 (low dose [LD]), 200 (medium dose [MD]), and 300 (high dose [HD]) µg/kg. LD,&#xD;
      MD, and HD were assigned in that order, and VLD was inserted randomly and in a double-blind&#xD;
      fashion at any time after the first dose (LD). In measurements during the 24 hours after each&#xD;
      dose all participants have experienced a significant relief in symptoms (23%-100% as measured&#xD;
      by the Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale [YBOCS]) in at least one of the sessions. Two of&#xD;
      the subjects reported that their symptomatic improvement lasted most of the following week&#xD;
      after testing. One subject achieved long-term remission at the end of the 4 test sessions, as&#xD;
      measured at 6-month follow-up. There was, however, no clear dose-response relationship to the&#xD;
      change in YBOCS score and no correlation between YBOCS score reduction and the perceived&#xD;
      intensity of the psychedelic experience.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These preliminary findings stress the need for further research to examine the efficacy of&#xD;
      psilocybin in the treatment of OCD. In addition, the only clinical trial to date did not&#xD;
      include psychotherapy for patients while under the influence of psilocybin. Earlier studies&#xD;
      have shown that a preliminary therapeutic relationship before psilocybin administration&#xD;
      increases the probability for a &quot;peak experience&quot; during sessions. Furthermore, two more&#xD;
      recent studies have emphasized the importance of psychotherapy during and before psilocybin&#xD;
      sessions, touching on 'intent' and formulating an early and strong therapeutic relationship.&#xD;
      There is also a reference to the, &quot;psychedelic afterglow&quot;, an effect lasting for days and&#xD;
      even weeks after a psychedelic session during which there is a unique window for a meaningful&#xD;
      transformative psychotherapeutic intervention, most likely owing to the increased&#xD;
      psychological plasticity following a psychedelic experience.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The current study has two main goals: 1. Determine the safety and efficacy of psilocybin for&#xD;
      patients suffering from OCD. 2. Elucidate the psychological mechanisms contributing to the&#xD;
      beneficial effect of psilocybin on OCD symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Plan:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The current research aims to examine the feasibility, safety and efficacy of psychotherapy&#xD;
      assisted psilocybin for treatment of severe OCD. The protocol includes 15 therapeutic&#xD;
      sessions, of which 12 are one-hour sessions, and three are eight hours' experiential sessions&#xD;
      (session 4,8,12) under the influence of psilocybin. In the first experiential session&#xD;
      participants will receive a safety dose of 10mg/70kg. In the second and third sessions,&#xD;
      participants will receive a therapeutic dose of 30mg/70kg. Three preparatory sessions will&#xD;
      take place before the first experiential session, and three integration sessions will take&#xD;
      place after each experiential session.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research will include 15 participants, and will include the following phases:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Selection phase:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research team will screen participants via phone interviews. Participants answering the&#xD;
      inclusion criteria will be invited to receive and sign consent forms. Research member will&#xD;
      collect demographics and health status data and register the participants according to study&#xD;
      protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preparatory and final registration phase:&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is known that SSRIs have a counter effect on psilocybin; therefore, to allow a full effect&#xD;
      of psilocybin it is necessary to avoid drug interaction and discontinue previous treatment.&#xD;
      In a period of 4 weeks participants will undergo medication withdrawal under psychiatric&#xD;
      supervision. During the 4 weeks period each participant will have 2-4 sessions (as needed)&#xD;
      with the research psychiatrist, to supervise their clinical state. At the end of 4 weeks, a&#xD;
      psychiatric evaluation will take place to determine readiness to begin psilocybin treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline assessment, and preparatory therapeutic sessions phase:&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the 5-6 weeks from registration, participants will have three preparatory&#xD;
      psychotherapy sessions with a couple of therapists assigned to their treatment. Prior to&#xD;
      their first psychotherapy session, participants will complete the first-baseline assessment&#xD;
      of research questionnaires.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment phase:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The treatment phase includes three experiential sessions with psilocybin (sessions 4, 8, 12),&#xD;
      and three integration sessions after each experiential session. During this phase&#xD;
      participants will complete three assessments using research questionnaires (sessions 2, 10,&#xD;
      15).&#xD;
&#xD;
      End of treatment and follow-up phase:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary outcome assessment will take place at the end of the last therapeutic session&#xD;
      (no.15). Additional assessments will take place at three months, and six months/one-year&#xD;
      follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research procedure Participants will sign consent forms, before participating in the research&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The treatment is based on 15 therapy sessions:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Three preliminary sessions for establishing therapeutic alliance with the therapists and&#xD;
           preparing the participant for the first experiential session.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  An 8-hour experiential session with a safety dose of psilocybin (10mg/70 kg). (V4)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participant will spend the night at the medical facility, under the supervision of a&#xD;
           research member.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A 1-hour session with the therapists, on the following morning (V5)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Two integration sessions, and preparation for the next experiential session. (V6, V7)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  An 8-hour experiential session with a therapeutic dose of psilocybin (30mg/70 kg). (V8)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participant will spend the night at the medical facility, under the supervision of a&#xD;
           research member.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A 1-hour session with the therapists, on the following morning (V9)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Two integration sessions, and preparation for the next experiential session. (V10, V11)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  An 8-hour experiential session with a therapeutic dose of psilocybin (30mg/70 kg). (V12)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participant will spend the night at the medical facility, under the supervision of a&#xD;
           research member.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A 1-hour session with the therapists, on the following morning (V13)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Two integration and summary sessions. (V14, V15)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Possible discomfort:&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is possible that psilocybin and the experience it induces will cause some emotional or&#xD;
      physical discomfort. Investigators will address all possible discomforts and appropriate&#xD;
      measures to contain them, in the research safety instructions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research purpose:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective of this research is to use standardized measuring tools to explore the&#xD;
      safety and efficacy of psilocybin assisted psychotherapy in treating severe OCD symptoms. A&#xD;
      secondary aim is to explore possible variables underlying change in symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective is to assess efficacy of psilocybin assisted psychotherapy in treating&#xD;
      severe OCD symptoms. This assessment will be based on comparing ratings of the main outcome&#xD;
      measure (Y-BOCS), at baseline (session 2) at the middle and at end of treatment (session 10,&#xD;
      15 respectively). A score under 14 or a reduction of 35% in the overall score will be&#xD;
      considered as remission (Lewin, Nadai, Park, Goodman, Murphy &amp; Stroch, 2011).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives: assessing safety by collecting data on side effects, and assessing&#xD;
      possible spiritual variables underlying change in symptoms via standardized questionnaires&#xD;
      and semi constructed interviews.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The general safety goal is to assess occurrence and frequency of adverse events during&#xD;
      treatment. This includes suicide ideation and/or behaviour, and adverse physiological or&#xD;
      psychological responses. The safety of psilocybin use was previously proven in several&#xD;
      clinical research.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Potential adverse effects:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In general, psychedelic drugs have low levels of physiological toxicity, and previous&#xD;
      research indicate no evidence of toxicity, organ damage or neurophysiological disfunctions.&#xD;
      Possible physiological effects experienced under the influence of psychedelic substances may&#xD;
      include: dizziness, weakness, tremor, paresthesia, nausea, thirst, blurred vision, dilated&#xD;
      pupils, and hyperreflexia. These somatic effects are dynamic and relatively minor, even when&#xD;
      the psychological effect (sensory, perceptual, and cognitive) is strong/intense. The&#xD;
      significant risk associated with psilocybin intake, is a subjective experience of fear and&#xD;
      anxiety, panic, dysphoria and/or paranoia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recent clinical studies report a high safety level with no adverse effects. The high safety&#xD;
      levels can be attributed to several control parameters described below, and to complying with&#xD;
      safety guidelines in clinical psychotherapy with psychedelics. The use of psilocybin requires&#xD;
      a significant psychotherapeutic holding of the subjective experience, that will provide a&#xD;
      safe and supportive environment during the psychedelic experience. The safety guidelines in&#xD;
      clinical psychotherapy with psychedelics describe the therapeutic presence and processes, as&#xD;
      well as the set and settings needed to provide a supportive emotional and external&#xD;
      environment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety measures:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Controlling the quality of psilocybin and ensuring it is manufactured under GMP&#xD;
           conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Controlling for appropriate and adjusted dosage.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Controlling a strict protocol for screening eligible participants to the study (for&#xD;
           details see inclusion-exclusion criteria section)&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Recruiting professional and experienced psychotherapists with the appropriate training&#xD;
           for clinical psychotherapy with psychedelics. Professionals will undergo a unique&#xD;
           training to work with the psychotherapy protocol written for the current research.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Psychotherapists will work in pairs (a man and a woman), to provide an optimal holding&#xD;
           space for each participant.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. A proximity of a medical team for case of emergency.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Providing preparatory and integration sessions before and after the psilocybin sessions.&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. Preparing and using a comfortable and friendly room for the therapeutic session. The&#xD;
           physical environment in which the treatment takes place should be suitable to the&#xD;
           physical as well as the emotional safety of the participant. This means creating a&#xD;
           lenient environment, which provides a pleasant and welcoming atmosphere, and may elicit&#xD;
           a sense of intimacy and connection. As opposed to the environment of a hospital, a space&#xD;
           like this supports and strengthens the participant's sense of safety and connectedness,&#xD;
           thus helping him/her contain the intense psychedelic experience.&#xD;
&#xD;
        9. Guidelines for psychotherapy process: these guidelines are based on the humanistic&#xD;
           perspective, and concern the characteristic of the therapeutic process:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  A supportive, accepting, and non-judgmental presence of the therapist.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  The importance of the therapeutic alliance and trust between participant and&#xD;
                therapists.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  A non-directive approach, supportive and gentle presence that stays with the&#xD;
                participant's unfolding experience.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Viewing the mind as multi-dimensional, making space for the diverse dimensions of&#xD;
                the internal experience: physical, emotional, and spiritual.&#xD;
&#xD;
       10. Maintaining a well-documented monitoring of the study and the participants status during&#xD;
           the study period.&#xD;
&#xD;
       11. Monitoring physiological measure (blood pressure, heart rate and body temperature)&#xD;
           during the psychedelic sessions with psilocybin: before taking the drug, an hour and a&#xD;
           half after taking the drug, and 8 hours after. In case of anomalies physiological&#xD;
           measures will be monitor more frequently.&#xD;
&#xD;
       12. Consulting and collaborating with other research teams with similar research interests,&#xD;
           in NYU and Imperial College in London, UK.&#xD;
