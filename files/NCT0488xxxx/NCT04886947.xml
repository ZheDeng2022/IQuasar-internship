  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      More than four million children are born with birth defects worldwide every year and a&#xD;
      million presenting with cleft lip and palate. Cleft lip and palate is a congenital defect of&#xD;
      the lip alveolar and palate it's now recognized as a significant cause of infant mortality&#xD;
      and childhood morbidity and included among global burden of disease initiative. In Uganda the&#xD;
      estimated number of babies born with cleft lip and palate is 1100 per year Children with 75%&#xD;
      of them having alveolar cleft which is a defect in the upper jaw (Maxilla arch).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary bone graft and gingivoperiosteoplasty have become the two popular approaches to&#xD;
      bone generation in alveolar defect. These two methods have varying success rates; primary&#xD;
      gingivoperiosteoplasty 50 to 60% and secondary bone graft is 87% but Gingivoperiosteoplasty&#xD;
      is the preferred option to many African surgeons to obviate the need for bone grafting which&#xD;
      is technically demanding, prolonging therapy with many procedures therefore poor compliance,&#xD;
      also increasing treatment failure rate and has significant associated donor morbidity. This&#xD;
      project is set out to address the challenge of bone regeneration in alveolar cleft and&#xD;
      improve on the surgical outcome by the use of stem cell therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this study is to compare the outcome of umbilical cord blood stem cell&#xD;
      transplant plus gingivoperiosteoplasty to conventional gingivoperiosteoplasty on timing and&#xD;
      density of bone regeneration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      1.3. Hypothesis In this study we hypothesize that primary repair with gingivoperiosteoplasty&#xD;
      the success rate can be improved or enhanced with the use of stem cell therapy in our&#xD;
      setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Alternative hypothesis: Autologous umbilical stem cells transplantation following&#xD;
      gingivoperiosteoplasty results in better bone regeneration when compared to&#xD;
      gingivoperiosteoplasty.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Null hypothesis: Autologous umbilical stem cells transplantation following&#xD;
      gingivoperiosteoplasty has no benefit on promoting bone regeneration when compared to&#xD;
      gingivoperiosteoplasty alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be a case control pilot study conducted in Kiruddu National Referral hospital&#xD;
      Kampala Uganda. 20 participants who will be neonates of either sex with unilateral cleft lip&#xD;
      and palate will be recruited in the study. They will be split into two groups: group A will&#xD;
      have the umbilicus cord and placenta blood collected at birth and group B will not have&#xD;
      umbilical cord or placenta blood collected and will be designated as the Control group.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A lot has progressed in the care of Cleft lip and palate with development of&#xD;
      multidisciplinary team approach. Despite these achievements there are still a lot of&#xD;
      challenges in the treatment of alveolar cleft. Alveolar cleft being the less conspicuous&#xD;
      component of the cleft abnormality attracted less interest in its correction; its treatment&#xD;
      history dates in the not-so-distant past were as cleft lip history repair dates as far as 390&#xD;
      Before Christ and palate repair in 1764. The first attempt to treat alveolar cleft with bone&#xD;
      graft was in 1901 then again in 1908 but it was not until 1914 that Dracher was the first to&#xD;
      perform a successful bone graft of the alveolar defect using tibial bone that gave birth to&#xD;
      the primary alveolar bone graft. This approach was later found to be destructive to the&#xD;
      developing face and was abandoned. Then in 1972 Secondary bone grafting of maxilla and&#xD;
      residual alveolar clefts at the stage of transitional dentition this become popular in some&#xD;
      centers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In 1967 Swedish Plastic Surgeon Tord Skoog introduced yet a new concept called boneless&#xD;
      alveolar graft or primary periosteoplasty (PPP) which he performed during the time of lip&#xD;
      repair at 3 months in this repair periosteal flaps were raised clearing soft tissue between&#xD;
      the alveolar defect and the flaps were closed to form a tunnel at the time of lip repair.&#xD;
      This was because it was believed that with time bone would form in the tunnel and so bone&#xD;
      graft will not be needed. Follow up in many studies indicated bone developed in the tunnel in&#xD;
      about 60 to 72% of the cases. His follow up study up to the age of 18years indicated that&#xD;
      despite a delay in facial growth at early age by 18 years all are at the same level.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is set out to address the challenge of bone regeneration in alveolar cleft and&#xD;
      improve on the surgical outcome by the use of stem cell therapy in African population. All&#xD;
      the documented studies are conducted only in non-African populations which have slightly&#xD;
      different phenotype and use to pre-surgical orthodontic treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stem-cells are un-differentiated progenitor cells capable of self-renewal and differentiation&#xD;
      into any specialized cells. Umbilical cord stem cells in gingivoperiosteoplasty has shown&#xD;
      good bone regeneration in alveolar cleft and minimizing the donor mobility. But there is a&#xD;
      need for us to establish its possibility and effectiveness in out setting. This will be the&#xD;
      first stem cell trial in cleft treatment protocol in our region . With the establishment of a&#xD;
      stem cell center at Makerere and recently funded to improve its capacity, we believe we can&#xD;
      contribute to the improvement of cleft care in Uganda.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Problem statement The current accepted gold standard protocol for alveolar defect is&#xD;
      controversial on timing, outcome, and associated morbidity. Therefore, the second common&#xD;
      protocol of Gingivoperiosteoplasty (GPP) carried out during primary lip repair at 3 to 6&#xD;
      months would provide a better alternative by providing early repair with a smaller number of&#xD;
      surgeries and also obviate the need for secondary bone graft with further use of stem cell&#xD;
      transplant. The use of umbilical stem cell transplantation in gingivoperiosteoplasty&#xD;
      procedure has only been done in 10 cases and the results indicate good bone regeneration in&#xD;
      the alveolar bone defect. Despite the demonstration of success in the previous stem cell&#xD;
      therapy there is need to do a clinical trial in African population to prove the role and use&#xD;
      of stem cells in alveolar bone regeneration in our setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Significance The findings of this study will demonstrate the therapeutic role of stem-cell&#xD;
      therapy as an effective alternative bone generator to bone graft in correction of alveolar&#xD;
      defect in cleft lip and palate. This will present a paradigm shift in the treatment of&#xD;
      patients with cleft lip and palate by eliminating the need for secondary bone graft. Such a&#xD;
      study will also promote the establishment by Makerere University and the government of&#xD;
      super-specialized treatment such as stem-cell therapy. closing the gap between academia stem&#xD;
      cells in the laboratory and clinical practice. This study currently being the only clinical&#xD;
      trial in the use of umbilical blood stem in alveolar reconstruction in the region will pave&#xD;
      way for further utilization of stem cells as well as developing standard operating&#xD;
      procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      1.6. Justification The theory of GPP is consistent with the goal of minimizing the number of&#xD;
      secondary surgeries by optimizing results of primary surgery. And the most important outcome&#xD;
      obtained is the elimination of secondary bone graft. It's important to have limited&#xD;
      dissection to prevent risk of iatrogenic restriction of facial growth so introduction of an&#xD;
      additional source of bone generation will further improve on the outcome of GPP with no need&#xD;
      for extensive dissection. This study will also improve on the knowledge attitude and practice&#xD;
      of the use of umbilical cord blood stem cells for clinical purpose and more so in surgery to&#xD;
      generate bone. The umbilical cord stem cell is chosen as the source of stem cells because it&#xD;
      has a high number and high rate of regeneration Being the first study in our setting on&#xD;
      primary alveolar repair we propose the finding will define the role of stem cell therapy in&#xD;
      cleft lip and palate surgery and demonstrate the usefulness of stem cells in the future of&#xD;
      correcting alveolar defect with no need of bone graft.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.2. STUDY PROCEDURE We shall establish a surveillance team in Mulago Women's hospital,&#xD;
      Kawempe and Mukono Hospital Plus Kisenyi health center. The Ante Natal Care radiology team in&#xD;
      these centers will be trained on the key parameters of interest and once they identify any&#xD;
      fetus with a cleft lip and palate on ultrasound, they will obtain the mothers demographics&#xD;
      including the phone contact. Once this information is provided to the PI, the mothers will be&#xD;
      contacted and evaluated for eligibility. In case they meet the preliminary eligibility&#xD;
      criteria, informed consent will be obtained and the mothers will be followed up to the time&#xD;
      of delivery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the child born has unilateral cleft lip and cleft palate with clinical evidence of&#xD;
      alveolar cleft will be recruited into the study and then placenta and cord blood will be&#xD;
      collected for harvest of stem cells will be known the cases: A arm Arm B: Children with cleft&#xD;
      lip and palate having similar clinical presentation of cleft lip and palate where it was not&#xD;
      possible to collect umbilical cord and placental blood will be the Control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The surgical procedure will be done by a single plastic surgeon and the same surgical&#xD;
      technique for all participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stem cell group mothers will have screening for HIV, Hepatitis done before processing of the&#xD;
      stem cell if found reactive the process will not proceed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interventional arm A:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Collection of Umbilical cord blood:&#xD;
&#xD;
      • Umbilical cord blood will be collected by midwives using Marcopharma Cord blood collection&#xD;
      kit (https://www.macopharma.com/products/collection-bags/) (figure #). Once the baby is&#xD;
      safely delivered, the midwife will clamp the umbilicus end near the baby and add another&#xD;
      clamp two centimeter above and a transection made between both clamps after appropriately&#xD;
      disinfecting. Using the collection bag set, a needle will be inserted into the vein in the&#xD;
      cord and blood allowed to flow by gravity into the bag. When the flow stops, the blood bag&#xD;
      will be clamped to prevent leakage and the bag gently inverted for 8 to 10 times to allow&#xD;
      normal mixing with the anticoagulant. The bag will then be labeled with the unique patient ID&#xD;
      and mother's details, collection tubing arm clipped and the bag sealed. The bag will then be&#xD;
      placed in a biohazard ziplock bag labeled with the mother's details and then placed in a cool&#xD;
      box at room temperature. And transported to the laboratory.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Processing of the stem cells:&#xD;
&#xD;
      • Once the cord blood collection bags and tissue reach the laboratory, any tubing attached to&#xD;
      the bag will be stripped and mix very thoroughly ensuring that the tubings are sealed. The&#xD;
      stem cells will be processed and prepared for cryopreservation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cryopreservation of stem cells:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The density of cells required for Cryopreservation will be determined based on the cell&#xD;
           count results as this will help determine the volume of Cryopreservation Medium needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cells will be suspended in the cryopreservation medium and centrifuged at 200 x g for 10&#xD;
           min. And the media aspirated, leaving behind the cell pellet.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The cell pellet will be resuspended in the appropriate volume of the cryopreservation&#xD;
           medium.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Suspended cells will be transferred into sterile cryovials.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Once the cell suspension has been transferred to a sterile cryovial, the cryovial will&#xD;
           be transferred to a -80°C freezer and stored vertically for a 24-hr. time period.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  At the end of 24 hrs., the tubes will be transferred into a liquid nitrogen storage unit&#xD;
           for long-term cryostorage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thawing and preparation for infiltration:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  2 wells of Matrigel will be prepared the day before thawing the cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cells will be thawed quickly by swirling the vial in a 37oC water bath until only a&#xD;
           small chip of frozen material remains.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The vial will be swabbed with alcohol and place in the tissue culture hood and the&#xD;
           contents transferred to a 15ml tube&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  5ml of pre-warmed culture medium will be added and mixed gently.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If there are many visible colonies, they will be allowed to sediment at room temperature&#xD;
           for 5 min. If colonies are not visible, spin at 200g for 5 min.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The supernatant will be aspirated and resuspended in 2ml of culture medium.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  1 well of Matrigel will be aspirated and thawed cells added to it.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Colonies will evenly be distributed by gentle agitation and incubate overnight in a&#xD;
           tissue culture incubator (37oC/5% CO2).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The next day, the second well of Matrigel will be aspirated and the supernatant&#xD;
           transferred from the first well onto it and 2ml of culture medium will be added.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The colonies will be evenly distributed by gentle agitation and incubated overnight in a&#xD;
           tissue culture incubator (37oC/5% CO2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.2.2.1.5. Interventional Arm A; Surgical procedure:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cleft and palate repair will be done at 3 to 6 months&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The repair will be done under general anesthesia with vasoconstrictor injection.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Osseus tunnel will be created by removing soft tissue between the 2 alveolar segments.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The roof of the tunnel will be created using the nasal flaps&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The floor will be created by closure of the oral flaps.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The anterior lower wall will be created by the labial flaps.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The anterior superior wall is created with the lip mucosa.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Thus, the chamber is sealed nasally, orally, and labially by mucoperiosteal flaps&#xD;
&#xD;
      Infiltration of the stem cells:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stem cells will be injected in and around the tunnel and some of the stem cells will be&#xD;
      scuffled in surgicel and placed within the osseus tunnel.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post infiltration processing and handling:&#xD;
&#xD;
      • Patients will be monitored after surgery for 48 hours to one moth for any complications&#xD;
      then at 3 months and 6 months for bone regeneration. Using CT scan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The control group; We be selected with the same clinical presentation similar age group and&#xD;
      having the same surgical procedure except there will be no intervention of stem cell. And&#xD;
      also followed from one week to a moth for complications then 3 and 6 months CT scan to&#xD;
      monitor alveolar bone growth.&#xD;
