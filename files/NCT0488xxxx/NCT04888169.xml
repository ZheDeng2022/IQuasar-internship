  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators will complete an entirely remote randomized controlled trial (RCT)&#xD;
      comparing 14 sessions of attention bias modification (ABM), attention control training (ACT),&#xD;
      placebo neutral attention training, and a final control condition with daily questions in&#xD;
      1,897 individuals with clinically significant Post-traumatic Stress Symptoms (PTSS) (defined&#xD;
      as PCL-5 score â‰¥ 33). To assess effects of the training and control conditions, the&#xD;
      investigators will administer tests of threat-related attention bias and variability, and&#xD;
      self-report assessments of PTSS, depression, anxiety, and perceived stress at baseline, after&#xD;
      one and two weeks of training, and at eight-week follow up. The investigators plan to screen&#xD;
      and confirm interest from over 3,000 eligible participants over a period of 24 months to&#xD;
      enroll and randomize 1,897 participants with the end goal of 1,232 completers (176 per&#xD;
      condition).&#xD;

    <description>Looking at the change of PCL scores from prior to beginning (baseline) and directly after completing the training at week 4. PCL scores range from 0-80 with a score of 33 indicating clinically significant levels of PTSD. A 10 point change (up or down) is considered a clinically significant change in PTSD symptoms.&#xD;
A PCL score of &lt;33 indicates non-clinically significant PTSS. A PCL score of &gt;= 33 indicates clinically significant PTSS.</description>

    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>Attention bias modification training involves a probe detection task as follows: (1) a fixation cross appears on the screen for 500ms; (2) the fixation cross is replaced by two target stimuli (one threat word and one neutral word) that are displayed at the top and the bottom of the screen for 500ms; (2) the stimuli disappear and a visual probe appears (the letter E or F), in the location of one of the two stimuli until the participant responds to indicate whether the letter was an E or an F using response buttons at the bottom of the phone screen. In the active ABM condition, the probe replaces the neutral stimulus 100% of the time.</description>
