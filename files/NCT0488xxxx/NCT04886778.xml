  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Over the years, increasing obesity prevalence represents an important threat to national and&#xD;
      global public health. Many strategies studied for weight loss have reported that&#xD;
      low-carbohydrate diets showed beneficial effects on weight loss for obese patients. However,&#xD;
      individual weight losses have varied widely within low-carbohydrate diet groups due to the&#xD;
      influence of gut microbiota, which was found in the previous clinical studies of our team&#xD;
      (ChiCTR1800015156). Numerous animal studies and clinical trials have evaluated the impact of&#xD;
      probiotics on glucose and lipid metabolism as well as weight-loss interventions. However, the&#xD;
      effect of the different probiotic strains may play a different role in the same species.&#xD;
      Therefore, our team isolated new strains (Lactobacillus reuteri PLBK1，GDMCC No:&#xD;
      60828、Lactobacillus reuteri PLBK2，GDMCC No: 60829、Lactobacillus gasseri PLBK3，GDMCC No:&#xD;
      60830、Lactobacillus acidophilus PLBK4，GDMCC No: 60831、Bifidobacterium lactis PLBK5，GDMCC No:&#xD;
      60832) from the oral cavity, feces or environment of the Chinese race in the previous study.&#xD;
      The mixed solid beverage composed of these five strains has local characteristics and meets&#xD;
      the requirements of the national standard for food additives, which has obtained the national&#xD;
      food production license (SC10632028100205).In our previous animal experiments, the treatment&#xD;
      of compound preparation of the above five strains improve insulin resistance and dyslipidemia&#xD;
      effectively in obese mice induced by high-fat diet，which obtained significant weight loss .&#xD;
      Nevertheless, clinical trials are needed to be carried out to confirm its clinical effect.&#xD;
      Therefore, we aimed to conduct a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled prospective&#xD;
      study on the basis of previous research. In order to evaluate the efficacy and safety, as&#xD;
      well as the effect on glucose and lipid metabolism of low-carbohydrate diet combined with&#xD;
      probiotics in obese participants, the study will last for 12 weeks. At the same time,&#xD;
      Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) will be used to clarify change in body fat distribution,&#xD;
      which may provide more clinical evidence for the application of this program in the&#xD;
      prevention and treatment of obesity in the future.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial. According to the&#xD;
      preliminary experimental results, the decrease in weight of the experimental group&#xD;
      intervening by low-carbohydrate diet combined with probiotics compound preparation was up to&#xD;
      (6.5±1.1) kg over the whole study period compared to that in control group adopted&#xD;
      low-carbohydrate diet combined with placebo, which was about (4.1±0.8) kg. When taking&#xD;
      superiority cutoff (δ) of 1.5kg, in α = 0.025 (one-sided) and the power (1-β) = 0.8, on the&#xD;
      premise that the two groups of research objects are equal in number, the sample size of the&#xD;
      experimental group and the control group is 19 cases respectively by using the PASS11.0&#xD;
      software to calculate (N1=N2=19 cases). Considering that a dropout rate of no more than 10%&#xD;
      may occur during follow-up, this study included a total sample size of no less than 44.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Forty-four obese participants who meet the inclusion/exclusion criteria are randomly assigned&#xD;
      to group A and group B at a ratio of 1:1. As the trial group, group A was treated with a&#xD;
      12-week low-carbohydrate diet combined with probiotic compound preparations, and group B was&#xD;
      treated as a placebo control group with a 12-week low-carbohydrate diet combined with placebo&#xD;
      treatment. Since the probiotic compound preparation is made of Lactobacillus reuteri,&#xD;
      Lactobacillus gasseri, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Bifidobacterium lactis, and resistant&#xD;
      dextrin (water-soluble dietary fiber), to eliminate the effect of resistant dextrin&#xD;
      (water-soluble meal fiber) on the experimental results, the placebo is prepared from&#xD;
      resistant dextrin (water-soluble meal fiber) and is packaged to be consistent with the&#xD;
      appearance of the probiotic compound preparation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the trial period, participants will attend face-to-face visits at 4-week (visit 3),&#xD;
      8-week (visit 4), and 12-week (visit 5). During each follow-up visit, participants will be&#xD;
      asked about their dietary structure, average daily calorie intake, exercise volume, adverse&#xD;
      events, and so on. Research assistants will record their heart rate, blood pressure, height,&#xD;
      weight, BMI, waist circumference, and waist-to-hip ratio. During the 12-week (visit 5),&#xD;
      research assistants will record fasting blood glucose, fasting insulin, insulin resistance&#xD;
      index (HOMA-IR), biomarkers of lipids metabolism (TG/TC/LDL/HDL), subcutaneous fat and&#xD;
      visceral fat volume, the fat fraction (FF). Fecal samples will be collected by participants&#xD;
      at baseline as well as at the end stage and be divided into 10 parts, each one is about&#xD;
      200-300mg. All fecal samples will be stored in a -80 ℃ freezer by researchers. At the end of&#xD;
      the experiment, fecal samples will be uniformly sent to Metabo-Profile Biotechnology&#xD;
      (Shanghai) Co., Ltd. to detect the composition of gut microbes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The data of this project will be collected from the Department of Endocrinology and&#xD;
      Metabolism, Zhujiang Hospital of Southern Medical University. Relevant information will be&#xD;
      obtained by consulting the inspection system and asking patients. All data will be recorded&#xD;
      independently by two specialized statisticians.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data management strictly abides by relevant regulations, and any transfer of electronic data&#xD;
      or subject-related data must be approved by the data management department. In case data is&#xD;
      transmitted through non-secure electronic networks, corresponding data protection rules must&#xD;
      be followed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The statistical methods are as follow:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. General analysis: In this study, if no special instructions are given, the data will be&#xD;
           described and analyzed according to the following general principles. Statistics&#xD;
           description: The mean, standard deviation and confidence interval will be given in&#xD;
           measurement data, and if necessary, the minimum, maximum, P25, median and P75 will be&#xD;
           given. When the non-parametric method is used, the median and interquartile range will&#xD;
           be given. The frequency distribution and the corresponding percentage will be given in&#xD;
           counting data. The frequency distribution and the corresponding percentage and average&#xD;
           rank will be given in grade data. Basic principles: All statistical inferences use&#xD;
           two-sided tests, the statistically significant test level is set at 0.05, and the&#xD;
           confidence interval of the parameters is estimated to be 95% confidence interval. The&#xD;
           comparison of counting data between groups depends on the theoretical frequency, using&#xD;
           χ2 test, continuous correction χ2 test or Fisher's exact probability method. Two&#xD;
           independent sample T-tests is used to compare normally distributed baseline measurement&#xD;
           data between groups. For non-normal distribution baseline measurement data, the Wilcoxon&#xD;
           rank sum test is used for comparison between groups. Continuous variables measured at&#xD;
           multiple time points are analyzed using a Mixed effect model. p&lt;0.05 is considered&#xD;
           significant in the study. Missing data: The mixed linear model will be used to obtain&#xD;
           the point estimation and standard deviation of the treatment effect. The Markov chain&#xD;
           Monte Carlo method is used to fill in the missing data in the multivariate analysis.&#xD;
           Abnormal data: Interquartile range whose observation value is greater than P75 or less&#xD;
           than P25 more than 3 times will be judged as outlier data. In the analysis process,&#xD;
           sensitivity analysis will be used for outlier data, that is, both retention and&#xD;
           elimination of outlier data are analyzed. If the results are not contradictory, the data&#xD;
           will be retained; if contradictory, it will be depended on the specific situation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Basic characteristics: The mean, standard deviation, median, maximum and minimum will be&#xD;
           calculated for quantitative data such as age, height, weight and BMI. The frequency and&#xD;
           percentage will be listed for qualitative information such as gender.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Efficacy analysis: The efficacy analysis will be based on the Full Analysis Set (FAS).&#xD;
           Analysis of the main efficacy indicators: the extent of weight loss during the trial&#xD;
           period is a continuous variable, so that the results will be analyzed using Mixed&#xD;
           effects model. In the model, subject factors are considered as random effects and&#xD;
           intervention, time and mutual interaction effects are considered as fixed&#xD;
           effects.Analysis of secondary efficacy indicators: After 12-week intervention, the&#xD;
           continuous variables such as insulin resistance indicators, waist circumference,&#xD;
           waist-to-hip ratio, lipids (TG/TC/LDL/HDL), body fat percentage (BF%), subcutaneous and&#xD;
           visceral adipose tissue volume, fat fraction (FF) compared with the baseline will be&#xD;
           analyzed by mixed effects model. Other categorical variables are analyzed using χ2 test,&#xD;
           continuous correction χ2 test or Fisher's exact probability method.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Security analysis: The safety rating will be based on the safety set (SS), with&#xD;
           descriptive statistical analysis as the main focus. The adverse events, serious adverse&#xD;
           events and reactions occurred in the two groups will be analyzed. An adverse reaction is&#xD;
           defined as an adverse event that has a relationship with the study drug as &quot;definitely&#xD;
           related or may be related or undeterminable&quot;. The laboratory results that are normal&#xD;
           before the trial but abnormal after treatment will be described. The mean, standard&#xD;
           deviation, median, minimum and maximum values of blood pressure, heart rate and&#xD;
           laboratory indicators before and after the intervention in the two groups, as well as&#xD;
           the number and rate of &quot;normal turned abnormal&quot; or &quot;abnormal aggravation&quot; of vital signs&#xD;
           and laboratory indicators will be calculated.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Sensitivity analysis: Sensitivity analysis will be performed after missing data filling&#xD;
           and abnormal data elimination.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Statistical software and general requirements: SPSS 24.0 statistical software is used&#xD;
           for data entry and statistical analysis.&#xD;
