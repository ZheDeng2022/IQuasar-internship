  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the feasibility and initial clinical safety of&#xD;
      eCLIPs device use for the treatment of wide-necked bifurcation aneurysms. The eCLIPs device&#xD;
      is a novel shield like implant that is placed across the neck of the aneurysm and not only&#xD;
      facilitates coil retention but also partly obstructs the flow of blood into the aneurysm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an early feasibility study, which is a small study investigating an innovative device&#xD;
      to gather more clinical data before conducting a larger study. The safety and the effects of&#xD;
      the device on the aneurysm will be studied for 12 months after the procedure among 15&#xD;
      patients at approximately 4 participating hospital centers. A larger study will be required&#xD;
      to determine the safety and efficacy of the eCLIPs device for the treatment of wide-necked&#xD;
      bifurcation aneurysms.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to obtain preliminary confirmation that the eCLIPs&#xD;
      Delivery Wire is safe and provides sufficient technical performance in delivering the eCLIPs&#xD;
      Implant to distal tortuous anatomies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will be a multicentre, open label, single-arm safety, technical performance, and&#xD;
      efficacy study of the Electrolytic eCLIPs Bifurcation System in the management of bifurcated&#xD;
      intracranial aneurysms (IA). Subjects included in the study will have saccular intracranial&#xD;
      aneurysms that arise at or adjacent to a bifurcation, having a neck length of â‰¥ 4mm or have a&#xD;
      dome:neck ratio &lt;2. Aside from the implantation of the eCLIPs Implant, the study will follow&#xD;
      usual clinical care practices.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The subjects will undergo clinical assessments at pre-discharge and 30 days, as well as&#xD;
      clinical assessment and radiographic imaging at 6 and 12 months (Digital Subtraction&#xD;
      Angiography; DSA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is important to note that changes to the investigational device may occur during the&#xD;
      course of this early feasibility study. Ongoing results of the study will be evaluated, along&#xD;
      with collection of detailed operator feedback on usability, in order to determine whether&#xD;
      further refinements to the eCLIPs Delivery Wire are required.&#xD;
