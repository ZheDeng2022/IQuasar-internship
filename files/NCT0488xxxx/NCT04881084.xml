  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Stories of suffering and struggle are shared continuously through digital formats such as&#xD;
      internet videos, news stories, social marketing, and fundraising campaigns. Digital stories&#xD;
      are often created and shared to generate awareness about a problem, impart knowledge on&#xD;
      contemporary issues, or promote compassion. The practice of sharing critical life events and&#xD;
      insights provided by these experiences are valuable for tellers and the listeners alike for&#xD;
      catharsis, healing, reconciliation, and connectiveness. Portrayals of mental suffering are a&#xD;
      matter of cultural and social interest as new media products become available to the public.&#xD;
      Studies published since the 1990s overwhelmingly conclude that formal media depictions are&#xD;
      biased, promoting the stereotype that people who suffer emotionally are mentally ill,&#xD;
      dangerous, violent, or insane. Various agencies, organizations, and corporations are actively&#xD;
      working to provide alternative stories/narratives to mainstream media by means of video&#xD;
      testimonials in social marketing and fundraising campaigns and, ultimately, by taking&#xD;
      advantage of the Internet. The impact of this work is under-researched. However, preliminary&#xD;
      evaluations of social marketing campaigns report mixed results and raise questions about&#xD;
      their effectiveness. As well, the first-person narrative prepared digitally and shared online&#xD;
      is also providing alternative narratives to mainstream media stories. People are increasingly&#xD;
      using digital videos to share their stories, viewing this as an opportunity to understand&#xD;
      their emotions and thoughts, come to terms with disgrace around sensitive, personal issues&#xD;
      and marginalization while providing hope and encouragement to others. This proposed study&#xD;
      focuses on the process of creating digital narratives/stories, especially stories of mental&#xD;
      and emotional suffering, and their impact in terms of inciting empathy, compassion, and good&#xD;
      citizenship among viewers.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Digital stories -- first person, self-made 2-3-minute videos -- aim to generate awareness&#xD;
      about problems, impart knowledge, or promote compassion. Sharing critical life events and&#xD;
      related insights are invaluable for tellers and listeners alike, supporting catharsis,&#xD;
      healing, reconciliation, and connectiveness. Digital stories are created and shared among&#xD;
      organizations or citizens ( &quot;ordinary&quot; people without a background in filmmaking) to promote&#xD;
      awareness of particular problems. They impact peoples' knowledge of contemporary issues,&#xD;
      shaping attitudes by stimulating empathy, compassion, and active citizenship.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed study explores digital stories/narratives, particularly those focused on mental&#xD;
      health recovery, and how stories elicit empathy and compassion by addressing three main&#xD;
      questions: (1) How is mental and emotional suffering depicted in video testimonies presented&#xD;
      by social marketing/fundraising campaigns, versus the stories of ordinary people told through&#xD;
      digital videos? (2) What impact does digital storytelling have for the creators, as ordinary&#xD;
      people willing to revisit difficult life moments and transform them into digital videos? (3)&#xD;
      What is the impact of video depictions on viewers in terms of empathy and compassion?&#xD;
&#xD;
      This mixed-method study has 3 phases: In Phase 1 (Preparation), a search will be conducted to&#xD;
      identify activities related to Canadian social marketing and fundraising campaigns. Digital&#xD;
      storytelling workshops will be held simultaneously, and in-depth interviews conducted before&#xD;
      and after each workshop. Social service and community organizations located in Montreal,&#xD;
      Canada, will be contacted to promote the digital storytelling workshops, to be implemented in&#xD;
      the community and on university campuses. In Phase 2, a pilot randomized controlled trial&#xD;
      (RCT) will be undertaken and more in-depth interviews conducted. Phase 3 will consist of&#xD;
      knowledge dissemination activities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The knowledge acquired through this study on individual and societal responses to stories of&#xD;
      human suffering will have a practical impact on future social marketing campaigns promoted by&#xD;
      government agencies, fundraising campaigns launched by nonprofit and for-profit&#xD;
      organizations, and the public. Results will consolidate previous knowledge while providing&#xD;
      new insights into what prompts citizens to help others.&#xD;
