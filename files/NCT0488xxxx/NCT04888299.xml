    <textblock>
      Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) are chronic inflammatory disorders that can be categorized&#xD;
      as ulcerative colitis (UC), Crohn's disease (CD) and indeterminate colitis (IC). Deep&#xD;
      remission has been shown to improve disease outcome. There may be a lack of concordance&#xD;
      between endoscopic and histologic remission. IBD patients with long standing colitis are at&#xD;
      risk of developing dysplasia and colorectal cancer (CRC). However, it can be challenging to&#xD;
      diagnose dysplasia in IBD patients during colonoscopy, as dysplasia frequently manifests as&#xD;
      non-pedunculated lesions that present with only subtle visible changes or are even invisible&#xD;
      due to the surrounding inflammation, scarring, pseudopolyps, or hyperplasia. Although white&#xD;
      light endoscopy and chromoendoscopy are the current standard modality of imaging, there is&#xD;
      still a gap to be bridged, in terms of improving endoscopic diagnosis of dysplasia and&#xD;
      improving concordance of endoscopic and histologic remission. Raman spectroscopy is an&#xD;
      inelastic light scattering technique provide specific fingerprints of molecular compositions&#xD;
      and structures of biological tissues. It may be able to provide additional diagnostic&#xD;
      information over standard endoscopy. A second-generation Raman endoscope system for improving&#xD;
      in vivo tissue characterization and diagnosis during colonoscopy has been developed (SPECTRA&#xD;
      IMDx system). Preliminary data suggested its utility in the diagnosis of colorectal neoplasia&#xD;
      during colonoscopy. There is currently a lack of data concerning the application of this&#xD;
      novel technology in the context of IBD. Specifically, whether the spectral signals generated&#xD;
      can be used to better classify disease remission, and thus achieve higher concordance with&#xD;
      histology when compared to standard endoscopy. It is also unclear whether this technology can&#xD;
      be used to differentiate dysplastic mucosa from non-dysplastic mucosal in IBD patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypotheses&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Raman spectroscopy based artificial intelligence system has the potential to be used to&#xD;
           differentiate disease remission from active mucosal inflammation and hence improve&#xD;
           concordance between endoscopic and histologic remission, with the potential to decrease&#xD;
           the need for random biopsies real-time during colonoscopy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Raman spectroscopy based artificial intelligence system has the potential to&#xD;
           differentiate dysplastic mucosa in IBD patients (low grade and high grade dysplasia;&#xD;
           colorectal cancer) from non-dysplastic mucosa. real-time during colonoscopy.&#xD;

      1. BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) are chronic inflammatory&#xD;
      disorders that can be categorized as ulcerative colitis (UC), Crohn's disease (CD) and&#xD;
      indeterminate colitis (IC). UC is characterised by chronic mucosal inflammation starting&#xD;
      distally in the rectum, with continuous extension proximally for a variable distance, often&#xD;
      with an abrupt demarcation between inflamed and non-inflamed mucosa. CD is characterized by&#xD;
      discontinuous segments of chronic granulomatous inflammation that can be transmural, and&#xD;
      involve the small bowel in addition to the colon, as well as the upper gastrointestinal&#xD;
      tract.1 The term IC is used when it is difficult to differentiate between UC and CD. UC, CD&#xD;
      and IC are chronic, progressive, and disabling conditions. Treatment need to go beyond&#xD;
      symptom control and aim to treat endoscopic/ macroscopic lesions with the final aim of&#xD;
      preventing structural damage and disability, thereby improving long term clinical outcomes.&#xD;
      Although endoscopic remission is the current treatment target, emerging data suggest that&#xD;
      achieving deep remission with histological remission, rather than just endoscopic remission,&#xD;
      may confer additional benefits. Commonly used endoscopic severity systems that correlated&#xD;
      well with clinical and biological activity include the modified Mayo Endoscopic score6 and&#xD;
      the Ulcerative Colitis Endoscopic Index of Severity (UCEIS) for UC and the Crohn's Disease&#xD;
      Endoscopic Index of Severity (CDEIS) and the Simplified Endoscopic activity Score for Crohn's&#xD;
      disease (SES-CD) for CD. However inter-observer variation remains a significant limitation&#xD;
      for these visual scores. In addition, there may also be a lack of concordance between&#xD;
      endoscopic and histologic remission. IBD patients with long standing colitis are at risk of&#xD;
      developing dysplasia and colorectal cancer (CRC). Multiple case-control studies and&#xD;
      population-based cohort studies have shown that endoscopic surveillance improves CRC-related&#xD;
      survival in IBD patients at increased risk for colon cancer. Endoscopic surveillance is&#xD;
      widely recommended by international gastrointestinal societies for the early detection and&#xD;
      resection of dysplasia or CRC. However, unlike non-IBD patients, it can be challenging to&#xD;
      diagnose dysplasia in IBD patients during colonoscopy, as dysplasia frequently manifests as&#xD;
      non-pedunculated lesions that present with only subtle visible changes or are even invisible&#xD;
      due to the surrounding inflammation, scarring, pseudopolyps, or hyperplasia. Although high&#xD;
      definition white light endoscopy and chromoendoscopy are the current standard modality of&#xD;
      imaging, there is still a gap to be bridged, in terms of improving endoscopic diagnosis of&#xD;
      dysplasia and improving concordance of endoscopic and histologic remission.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Raman spectroscopy is an inelastic light scattering technique that is capable of providing&#xD;
      specific spectroscopic fingerprints of molecular compositions and structures of biological&#xD;
      tissues. When light energy is incident on a tissue, the light energy is absorbed and&#xD;
      subsequently scattered. Much of the energy is scattered elastically, but a small amount (&lt;1%)&#xD;
      is scattered inelastically. Such inelastic scattering is termed Raman scattering and is&#xD;
      measured by wavelength shifts that is associated with distinct molecular compositions. For&#xD;
      example, spectral ranges of 850 - 1150, 1200 - 1500, and 1600 - 1750 cm-1 correspond to&#xD;
      signals related to proteins, nucleic acids and lipids respectively. Cancerous tissue is&#xD;
      associated with higher metabolic rate and hence different molecular makeup from non-cancerous&#xD;
      tissue. By investigating the tissue's Raman spectra, which also serves as a bio-fingerprint,&#xD;
      the investigators can identify if the tissue is cancerous or non-cancerous. Raman&#xD;
      spectroscopy has been reported for colorectal tissue characterization and diagnosis ex vivo.&#xD;
      Molckovsky et al applied an endoscope-compatible Raman probe for differential diagnosis&#xD;
      between adenoma and hyperplastic polyp in vivo, but tissue Raman spectra acquired were&#xD;
      limited to the so-called fingerprint (FP) range (i.e., 800-1800 cm-1), and the acquisition&#xD;
      time was lengthy (&gt;5 s) that was impractical for routine clinical endoscopic examinations.&#xD;
      The diagnostic efficiency of FP Raman spectroscopy could be compromised in patients owing to&#xD;
      intrinsically very weak tissue Raman signals and overwhelming tissue autofluorescence (AF) of&#xD;
      the internal organs. In addition to colorectal neoplasia, Raman spectroscopy has been studied&#xD;
      in the context of IBD in small scale ex-vivo and in-vivo studies, with promising results in&#xD;
      terms of differentiation of mucosal healing and inflammation, and differentiate UC from CD&#xD;
      However these IBD related studies face the similar limitations as the studies in colorectal&#xD;
      neoplasia, especially with regards to practicality for efficient in-vivo diagnosis. Recent&#xD;
      attentions have been directed toward the use of high-wavenumber (HW) regime (e.g., 2800-3600&#xD;
      cm-1), as HW spectral range exhibits stronger tissue Raman signals while having less&#xD;
      background interference from both tissue AF and fiber-optic probes. There are multiple&#xD;
      rationales for combining the FP and HW Raman techniques for in vivo tissue Raman&#xD;
      measurements: (i) For tissues that could exhibit intense AF overwhelming the tissue FP Raman&#xD;
      signals, the HW range could still contain intense tissue Raman peaks for tissue diagnosis;&#xD;
      (ii) The FP and HW Raman spectra offer complementary biomolecular information, and combining&#xD;
      FP/HW Raman technique could improve tissue characterization and diagnosis. Very recently, a&#xD;
      novel second-generation 785-nm excitation Raman endoscope that can simultaneously measure&#xD;
      both FP Raman spectra (i.e., 800-1800 cm-1) and high-wavenumber (HW) (i.e., 2800-3600 cm-1)&#xD;
      Raman spectra in real-time (&lt; 0.5 s) for improving in vivo tissue characterization and&#xD;
      diagnosis during colonoscopy was developed. The simultaneous FP/HW Raman technique is&#xD;
      integrated with a 1.8-mm endoscope-compatible fiber-optic Raman probe coupled with a sapphire&#xD;
      ball lens for probing biomolecular signatures from the subsurface of colorectal tissue&#xD;
      associated with dysplasia. This has been used to create the SPECTRA IMDx system which&#xD;
      interrogates tissue at the cellular level and utilizes molecular information to provide&#xD;
      physicians with actionable information in vivo real-time during colonoscopy. The SPECTRA IMDx&#xD;
      comprises a laser system, a spectrometer, a computer with an analysis algorithm installed,&#xD;
      and other ancillary parts. The SPECTRA IMDx probe is connected with the main system. The&#xD;
      SPECTRA IMDx probe is an assembly of optical fibres and optical components arranged for&#xD;
      maximal transmission of light energy. When in use, the laser system will emit a 785nm near&#xD;
      infra-red laser that will be transmitted through the SPECTRA IMDx probe to the distal end.&#xD;
      When the laser is interrogated upon a tissue surface, the light energy is absorbed and&#xD;
      reflected. The reflected energy is then collected from the distal end of the SPECTRA IMDx&#xD;
      probe, transmitted back to the main system, and passed through the spectrometer. The&#xD;
      collected signal is then processed to obtain the clean Raman signal for diagnostic&#xD;
      classification.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is currently a lack of data concerning the application of this novel technology in the&#xD;
      context of IBD. Specifically, whether the spectral signals generated can be used to better&#xD;
      classify disease remission, and thus achieve higher concordance with histology when compared&#xD;
      to standard endoscopy. It is also unclear whether this technology can be used to&#xD;
      differentiate dysplastic mucosa from non-dysplastic mucosal in IBD patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Overview This is a prospective observational study of all subjects with IBD (CD, UC or IC)&#xD;
      undergoing colonoscopy over a 24-month period. The workflow is summarized in figure 2.&#xD;
      Informed consent will be taken by the investigator before study enrolment. Subject&#xD;
      participation in this study will last only the duration of the colonoscopy procedure which is&#xD;
      about 30 to 45 minutes. Subjects will not be required to make an additional visit to the&#xD;
      hospital for the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bowel preparation and endoscopic procedure Prior to colonoscopy, subjects are required to&#xD;
      cleanse the colon using bowel preparation as per standard clinical practice. Colonoscopy is&#xD;
      performed with or without sedation at the discretion of the endoscopist and patient. During&#xD;
      the process of colonoscopy, which is performed using high definition endoscopy system with or&#xD;
      without adjunctive chromoendoscopy, biopsies of colonic mucosa may be obtained either for&#xD;
      assessment of the state of disease activity or to clarify the nature of a detected focal&#xD;
      lesion, which could be non-neoplastic such as hyperplastic or post-inflammatory polyps, or&#xD;
      neoplastic, such as IBD-associated dysplasia or sporadic colorectal neoplasia. The findings&#xD;
      for the ascending colon, transverse colon, descending colon, sigmoid colon and rectum will be&#xD;
      recorded separately. Lesions may also be resected using a snare. Prior to either the intended&#xD;
      biopsies of each region, or prior to endoscopic polypectomy, the SPECTRA IMDx probe will be&#xD;
      inserted through the working channel of the colonoscope to make contact with the mucosa&#xD;
      surface to collect the Raman signals. Biopsies are then obtained and labelled such that the&#xD;
      acquired Raman signals can be correlated with the gold standard of histology for creation of&#xD;
      diagnostic classifiers. No procedures will be placed on audiotape, film / video, or other&#xD;
      electronic medium as part of the study requirement. Endoscopy findings will be recorded in&#xD;
      the standard electronic medical report format. Endoscopy and histology results will be&#xD;
      transcribed to patient case report form and de-identified.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Severity of mucosal inflammation Classification systems for endoscopic assessment of disease&#xD;
      activity have been published.31 For UC and IC, the severity of disease activity will be&#xD;
      described based on Mayo Endoscopic Subscore6 and UCEIS. UCEIS has been validated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For CD, the definition of endoscopic disease severity does not rely only on the severity of&#xD;
      mucosal inflammation, and scoring systems such as Crohn's disease Endoscopic Index of&#xD;
      Severity (CDEIS) and Simple Endoscopic Score for Crohn's disease (SES-CD) incorporate other&#xD;
      components such as disease distribution and the presence of luminal narrowing as part of the&#xD;
      assessment. Both CDEIS and SES-CD are validated scoring systems. For this study, as the&#xD;
      research interest is solely on assessment of mucosal inflammation, the descriptors used for&#xD;
      mucosal involvement will be used, based on SES-CD, and mucosal healing will be defined as&#xD;
      absence of mucosal ulceration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Focal flat or polypoid lesions The morphology of detected superficial lesions suspicious of&#xD;
      either hyperplasia or dysplasia will be described using the Updated Paris Classification&#xD;
      (table 3, figure 3).32 A sessile lesion has a vertical height of &gt;2.5mm while that for mildly&#xD;
      elevated lesion is &lt; 2.5mm. For an excavated lesion, the depth is &gt; 1.2mm, whereas it is less&#xD;
      than 1.2mm for slightly depressed lesion. Biopsy forceps placed longitudinally next to the&#xD;
      lesion is a helpful reference standard (the diameter with closed jaws is 2.5 mm, while the&#xD;
      diameter of a single jaw is 1.2 mm). The estimated size, colour and margins of the lesion&#xD;
      with will be described. The endoscopic diagnosis will be documented.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Documentation of histology finding Histological severity of mucosal inflammation&#xD;
      Classification systems for histological assessment of disease activity have been published.&#xD;
      For UC or IC, this will be assessed using the Nancy Histological Index. Grade 0 and 1 defines&#xD;
      histological remission, 2 defines mildly active disease, 3 defines moderately active disease,&#xD;
      and 4 defines severely active disease. The Nancy index has been validated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For CD, this will be assessed using a scoring system previously developed by the IBD research&#xD;
      group in Leuven, Belgium. This scoring system has not been validated although it is widely&#xD;
      used for research.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Focal flat or polypoid lesions The WHO classification for colorectal serrated lesions and&#xD;
      polyps and the Riddell system for classification of IBD-associated dysplasia will be used.&#xD;
      IBD-associated dysplasia is defined as an unequivocal neoplastic alteration of the colonic&#xD;
      epithelium. It should be stressed that such dysplastic epithelium not only may be a marker or&#xD;
      precursor of carcinoma but may itself be malignant and associated with direct invasion into&#xD;
      the underlying tissue. This definition is analogous to the definition of dysplasia in&#xD;
      adenomas of the colon in the absence of IBD, in neoplastic lesions of the rest of the&#xD;
      gastrointestinal tract, and in other epithelia. Dysplasia is identified on the basis of a&#xD;
      combination of microscopic features, including 1) architectural alteration exceeding that&#xD;
      resulting from repair in chronic colitis, often resembling the glandular arrangement of&#xD;
      adenomas, and 2) cytologic abnormalities, principally cellular and nuclear pleomorphism,&#xD;
      nuclear hyperchromatism, loss of nuclear polarity, and marked stratification of nuclei.&#xD;
