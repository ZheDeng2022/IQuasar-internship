  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This longitudinal follow-up study aims to analyze how surgical and patient characteristics&#xD;
      affect clinical outcomes in the subjects received total hip arthroplasty (THA) or&#xD;
      hemiarthroplasty (HA).&#xD;

      Clinical assessments in this research include visual analogue scale (VAS), Harris Hip Score&#xD;
      (HHS), Oxford Hip Score (OHS), forgotten joint score (FJS-12) and X-ray imaging applied to&#xD;
      examine the stability of implants. Through analyzing surgical information, functional&#xD;
      measures and self-reported questionnaires, this study intends to gain insights into the&#xD;
      correlations between various clinical aspects.&#xD;

    <time_frame>Pre-operation, 6 weeks, 12 weeks and 1 year after surgery</time_frame>
    <description>Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) is a patient-reported outcome measure. Scale from 0 to 10 stands for no pain to extreme pain.</description>

    <measure>Harris Hip Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Pre-operation, 6 weeks, 12 weeks and 1 year after surgery</time_frame>
    <description>Harris Hip Score (HHS) assesses the results of hip replacement. the domains cover pain, function, absence of deformity and range of motion. The maximum score of HHS is 100, and the higher score participants get, the less dysfunction they have.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Oxford Hip Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Pre-operation, 6 weeks, 12 weeks and 1 year after surgery</time_frame>
    <description>Oxford Hip Score (OHS) is a patient-reported outcome measure with 12 questions related to the condition of function and pain. Total scores is from 0 to 48, higher scores represent a better outcome.</description>

    <measure>Forgotten Joint Score (FJS-12)</measure>
    <time_frame>Pre-operation, 6 weeks, 12 weeks and 1 year after surgery</time_frame>
    <description>Forgotten Joint Score (FJS-12) is a patient-reported questionnaire with 12 questions, assessing the ability of the patient to forget the affected joints during daily activities. The higher the scores, the better the outcome.</description>

    <measure>Radiographic analysis</measure>
    <time_frame>Pre-operation, 6 weeks, 12 weeks and 1 year after surgery</time_frame>
    <description>X-ray imaging will be applied to examine the stability of implants, such as radiolucent line and loosening. The width of radiolucent line around implant suggest the possibility of implant loosening; generally, the wider the width is, the higher risk of loosening.</description>

    <description>Hip arthroplasty is a kind of joint reconstruction surgery, which has been successfully utilized for treatment of osteoarthritis or hip fracture for decades. In this surgery, implants is applied to reconstruct hip joint, and usually comprised of four components, including femoral stem, femoral head, acetabular cup and liner.</description>
