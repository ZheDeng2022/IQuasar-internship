  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Adults with serious mental illness (SMI) represent 5% of the United States population, yet&#xD;
      account for 30% of all cigarettes smoked and are 2 to 3 times more likely to be dependent on&#xD;
      nicotine compared with the general population. There are also significant disparities in&#xD;
      quitting: 24% of lifetime smokers with SMI report not smoking within the past year compared&#xD;
      with 52% of lifetime smokers without SMI. Two barriers partly explain the large disparity in&#xD;
      smoking cessation rates between adults with and without SMI. First, there is a lack of&#xD;
      high-quality, evidence-based interventions for smoking cessation in populations with SMI,&#xD;
      which may be because adults with SMI are often excluded from clinical trials, despite&#xD;
      evidence indicating that SMI is highly comorbid with smoking. Second, clinicians and staff&#xD;
      within mental health settings generally do not have the resources or appropriate training to&#xD;
      provide smoking cessation treatments to patients with SMI. Smartphone-based mobile health&#xD;
      applications for smoking cessation could significantly improve cessation rates for adults&#xD;
      with SMI. However, smoking cessation apps are underutilized by smokers with SMI partly&#xD;
      because the apps are not designed for their unique needs. This study aims to conduct a pilot&#xD;
      randomized controlled trial to evaluate the feasibility of an innovative, evidence-based&#xD;
      smoking cessation app tailored for smokers with SMI. Seventy-five treatment-seeking smokers&#xD;
      with SMI who will be referred from the Oklahoma Department of Mental Health and Substance&#xD;
      Abuse Services (25 per group), a publicly funded outpatient psychiatry treatment program,&#xD;
      will be randomly assigned to receive either (1) QuitGuide, a free smoking cessation app&#xD;
      developed by the National Cancer Institute, (2) a smoking cessation app that tracks and&#xD;
      automatically intervenes upon psychological distress during a quit attempt and delivers&#xD;
      real-time intervention messages tailored to the current level of lapse risk and current lapse&#xD;
      triggers (Smart-T Mental Health; STMH), or (3) the STMH app with additional messaging focused&#xD;
      on increasing adherence to nicotine replacement medications (STMH+). All study conditions&#xD;
      will be followed for 5 weeks (1-week pre-cessation and 4 weeks post-cessation), receive&#xD;
      nicotine replacement therapy, and complete smartphone-based survey assessments using&#xD;
      ecological momentary assessment procedures.&#xD;

      SPECIFIC AIMS&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cigarette smoking is the leading preventable cause of morbidity and mortality in the United&#xD;
      States. Smokers with serious mental illness (SMI; e.g., schizophrenia, bipolar disorder,&#xD;
      major depressive disorder, anxiety disorders) have an increased risk of dying from cancer,&#xD;
      lung disease, and cardiovascular disease and account for more than 200,000 of the 520,000&#xD;
      tobacco-related deaths each year. Many studies have shown that smoking rates are 2-5 times&#xD;
      higher in adults with SMI compared with adults with no mental illness. People with SMI smoke&#xD;
      more frequently and heavily than the general population, and they often lack access to&#xD;
      cessation services. Furthermore, smokers with SMI are more dependent on nicotine and are less&#xD;
      likely to quit than those without SMI. Thus, smoking and smoking cessation in this population&#xD;
      are critical public health concerns that warrant further study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although there is substantial evidence for the effectiveness of multiple smoking cessation&#xD;
      treatments for the general population of smokers, these interventions tend to be less&#xD;
      effective or not effective at all when provided to smokers with SMI. Thus, while smoking&#xD;
      rates among those without a history of SMI has radically declined over the past 5 decades,&#xD;
      smoking prevalence among those with SMI has remained alarmingly high over this same time&#xD;
      period. While several studies have identified some reasons for disparities in smoking&#xD;
      cessation treatment effectiveness in adults with SMI, understanding of the complex causes of&#xD;
      this known and growing disparity remains limited. A more granular examination of the&#xD;
      cessation, lapse, and relapse process among adult smokers with SMI is needed: 1) to improve&#xD;
      understanding of smoking cessation in this vulnerable and understudied population, and 2) to&#xD;
      inform the development of more effective interventions for this underserved population.&#xD;
      Smartphone-based Ecological Momentary Assessments (EMA) have been used to identify&#xD;
      antecedents to smoking lapse in various populations. Just-in-Time Adaptive Interventions&#xD;
      (JITAI) that provide tailored treatment content for adults with SMI in moments when it is&#xD;
      needed most may offer cost-effective, easily accessible, highly tailored interventions in&#xD;
      free-living settings. To date, four smartphone-based smoking cessation JITAIs have been&#xD;
      created, and pilot tested in SMI samples. Yet, few JITAI for SMI populations have been&#xD;
      investigated regarding their acceptability, feasibility, and usefulness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The long-term goal of this research is to increase smoking cessation rates of smokers with&#xD;
      SMI using a smartphone-based mobile health application. The primary objective of this study,&#xD;
      which is the next step towards achieving this long-term objective, is to conduct a pilot&#xD;
      randomized controlled trial (RCT) to evaluate the feasibility of an innovative smoking&#xD;
      cessation app that has been tailored for smokers with SMI. Seventy-five treatment-seeking&#xD;
      smokers with SMI, referred from the Oklahoma Department of Mental Health and Substance Abuse&#xD;
      Services (ODMH),49 will be randomly assigned to receive either (1) QuitGuide,50 a free&#xD;
      smoking cessation app developed by the National Cancer Institute (NCI), (2) a smoking&#xD;
      cessation app that tracks and automatically intervenes upon psychological distress in&#xD;
      real-time during a quit attempt and delivers real-time intervention messages tailored to the&#xD;
      current level of lapse risk and current lapse triggers (i.e., Smart-T Mental Health; STMH),&#xD;
      or (3) STMH with additional nicotine replacement therapy adherence messaging (STMH+).&#xD;
      Participants in both study conditions will be followed for 5 weeks (1-week pre-cessation and&#xD;
      4 weeks post-cessation), receive nicotine replacement therapy (NRT), and complete&#xD;
      smartphone-based ecological momentary assessments (EMA). The primary objective of this study&#xD;
      will be attained by pursuing the following specific aims.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Determine the feasibility, ease of use, and perceived utility of a smoking cessation app&#xD;
      designed for adults with SMI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Determine preliminary estimates of the impact of treatment condition (i.e., STMH vs. STMH+&#xD;
      vs. QuitGuide app; n=25 per group) on biochemically verified smoking abstinence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      . Determine the effect of the STMH treatment messages on key lapse risk factors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Use qualitative interviews to examine perceptions of the STMH, STMH+, and QuitGuide smoking&#xD;
      cessation apps.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY OVERVIEW&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible and interested individuals (N = 75) will be randomized to 1 of 3 groups: 1)&#xD;
      smartphone-based smoking cessation intervention designed for adults with serious mental&#xD;
      illness (STMH) with NRT, 2) STMH plus additional NRT adherence messaging (STMH+) with NRT, or&#xD;
      3) NCI QuitGuide, a smartphone-based smoking cessation intervention designed for the general&#xD;
      population with NRT. Participants will be followed for 5 weeks, and the entire intervention&#xD;
      will be accessed remotely through personal or study provided smartphones, independently or&#xD;
      with assistance from study staff. Participants will be prompted to complete daily EMAs and&#xD;
      thrice-weekly smoking status tests using a portable, low-cost carbon monoxide monitor&#xD;
      (Bedfont iCO Smokerlyzer). These data will be used to address primary (i.e., biochemically&#xD;
      verified 7-day point prevalence abstinence at 4 weeks post-quit, number of days of abstinence&#xD;
      during the 4 week post-quit period) and secondary outcomes (e.g., 28-day point prevalence&#xD;
      abstinence, number of days to first lapse, the longest period of smoking abstinence). We have&#xD;
      already created software that integrates the iCO sensor into our InsightTM mHealth platform.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IMPORTANCE OF KNOWLEDGE REASONABLY EXPECTED TO RESULT FROM THE RESEARCH&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although many smartphone based smoking cessation apps exist, very few have been developed for&#xD;
      smokers with serious mental illness. This study is the first step towards developing a line&#xD;
      of research that aims to develop and disseminate effective and automated treatments for&#xD;
      smoking cessation for this underserved and understudied population. Thus, the knowledge that&#xD;
      will be gained from this study is important. Furthermore, the Smart-T Mental Health app will&#xD;
      allow us to reach a population that frequently lacks access to traditional intervention&#xD;
      programs, due to limited availability, income, and/or transportation, among other barriers.&#xD;
      In addition, the proposed smartphone app is highly versatile and may be easily modified for&#xD;
      use in other populations or communities. The risks to subjects are minimal, especially&#xD;
      considering the protections against risks that will be implemented for this study.&#xD;
