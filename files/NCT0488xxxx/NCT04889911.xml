  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall purpose of the proposed exploratory intervention development application, is to&#xD;
      conduct research that will inform the adaptation and preliminary testing of NECT modified for&#xD;
      youth (aged 15-24) with first episode psychosis (FEP), targeting self-concept and illness&#xD;
      conceptions to increase treatment engagement. The specific aims of the project are to: 1)&#xD;
      adapt NECT to be responsive to the needs and preferences of youth with FEP, and 2) Assess the&#xD;
      feasibility, acceptability and preliminary effectiveness of the modified intervention&#xD;
      (NECT-YA) combined with coordinated specialty care (CSC) services, compared to CSC services&#xD;
      alone, in a small (n = 40) RCT.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      We will conduct a small RCT of the modified intervention (NECT-YA), combined with CSC, in&#xD;
      comparison with CSC alone, with 40 persons recruited from three FEP programs, assessing&#xD;
      acceptability and feasibility, and collecting data on primary outcome (service engagement and&#xD;
      therapeutic alliance), related outcomes (self-esteem, hopelessness, and social functioning)&#xD;
      and mechanisms of action (self-stigma, illness conceptions and coping). We will also collect&#xD;
      qualitative data on participants' impressions of NECT-YA, which will inform additional&#xD;
      revisions of the manual.&#xD;

        - Inclusion criteria for the RCT phase will be assessed by an initial screening and the&#xD;
        baseline interview. We will use relatively broad inclusion criteria to maximize the&#xD;

        use or mood disorder that could be causing the psychotic symptoms (confirmed by program&#xD;
        eligibility); 2) Meets criteria for moderate (defined as a mean score of 1-1.5 on the 0-3&#xD;
        scale of the Internalized Stigma of Mental lllness Scale [ISMI]) or elevated (defined as a&#xD;
        mean score of 1.5-3 on the 0-3 scale of the ISMI) self-stigma; 3) Speaks English well&#xD;
        enough to complete assessments and participate in groups; 4) Is able to provide informed&#xD;
