  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a research study to find out if the new anti-cancer drug Durvalumab combined with&#xD;
      radiation therapy to the brain will work in treating brain metastases from non-small cell&#xD;
      lung cancer (NSCLC). Focused, highly precise radiation therapy to the brain, known as&#xD;
      stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS), is a standard of care treatment that is commonly used for&#xD;
      patients with metastatic lung cancer to the brain. It is standardly used as an alternative to&#xD;
      surgery to eradicate the targeted tumours in the brain and prevent them from growing and&#xD;
      causing symptoms. This study will look at the combination of the novel immunotherapy&#xD;
      Durvalumab with two different ways of delivering SRS: 1) with each radiation treatment given&#xD;
      every other day for 3 treatments with the first dose of Durvalumab (fSRT), or 2) with each&#xD;
      radiation treatment given every 4 weeks with each dose of Durvalumab for 3 treatments&#xD;
      (PULSAR).&#xD;

    <description>Durvalumab (initially developed as MEDI4736) is a human monoclonal antibody of the immunoglobulin (Ig) G1 kappa subclass that inhibits binding of PD-L1 (B7-H1, CD274) to PD-1 (CD279) and CD80 (B7-1). MEDI4736 is composed of 2 identical heavy chains and 2 identical light chains, with an overall molecular weight of approximately 149 kDa. MEDI4736 contains a triple mutation in the constant domain of the Ig G1 heavy chain that reduces binding to complement protein C1q and the fragment crystallizable gamma receptors involved in triggering effector function.</description>
