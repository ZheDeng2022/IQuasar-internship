  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cross-sectional study is to explore the impact of painful neuropathy in the feet on function&#xD;
      in persons living with HIV (PLHIV).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The overall goal of this study is to explore the impact of HIV-associated distal sensory&#xD;
      polyneuropathy on physical performance, physical activity, and pain pressure threshold.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim is to determine if the presence of painful distal sensory polyneuropathy in the feet&#xD;
      adversely affects physical performance, physical activity, and pain pressure threshold in&#xD;
      PLHIV.&#xD;
