  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single arm, multi-center clinical trial. Target population is patients with&#xD;
      Advanced or Metastatic Pulmonary Sarcomatoid Carcinoma，aiming to evaluate the efficacy and&#xD;
      safety of the combination therapy of Camrelizumab and famitinib . Camrelizumab is a humanized&#xD;
      anti-PD1 IgG4 monoclonal antibody, and famitinib is an orally bioavailable receptor tyrosine&#xD;
      kinase (RTK) inhibitor.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This trial enrolled patients with advanced or metastatic pulmonary sarcomatoid carcinoma.&#xD;
      Patients will receive camrelizumab 200 mg every 3 weeks and famitinib 20 mg once per day. The&#xD;
      primary endpoint is objective response rate (ORR) assessed by investigators per RECIST&#xD;
      version 1.1. Key secondary endpoints were progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival&#xD;
      (OS), duration of response, and safety.&#xD;
