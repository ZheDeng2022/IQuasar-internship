  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will investigate the effect of agility training on executive function, dual task&#xD;
      walking and brain activation in healthy adults. Participants (N=70) will be randomly assigned&#xD;
      to resistance+aerobic training group (RAeT) or agility training group (AT). Participants in&#xD;
      RAeT (n=35) will receive 15-minute lower extremity workout first and then 25-minute moderate&#xD;
      intensity (60-75% predicted maximal heart rate) aerobic training. Participants in AT (n=35)&#xD;
      will do the agility exercise program consisting of technical drills, pattern running and&#xD;
      reactive agility training. The intervention will be twelve-time group intervention&#xD;
      (3-5persons) in four weeks, 50 minutes per session (5-minute warmup, 40- minute main&#xD;
      training, 5-minute cool-down). Participants will undergo three measurement time points (pre-,&#xD;
      post-intervention and one month follow-up). Outcome measures will include executive function&#xD;
      (N-back test, stroop test and Wisconsin card sort test), single and dual task walking&#xD;
      performance and brain activity (fNIRS on prefrontal cortex, supplementary motor area and&#xD;
      premotor cortex). Two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with Tukey post-hoc test will be used&#xD;
      to examine the group x time interaction on three outcome measures.&#xD;

    <description>The RT focuses on lower extremity workout, including leg press, hamstring curls, and calf raises. The participants start with intensity at 12 RM and finished with intensity at 8 RM after 3 weeks. There are 8 repetitions, 2 sets for each action. It will take 15 minutes to complete RT.&#xD;
The AeT is composed by cycling on stationary bikes in the first week, stepping on steppers in 2nd week, and running on treadmills in the last week. Participants are asked to wear a portable heart rate monitor throughout the experiments. They have to maintain their heart rates in 60%-75% of predicted maximal heart rate (moderate intensity exercise), which has been shown to be benefit on cognition[3]. It took the participants 25 minutes to complete AeT.</description>
