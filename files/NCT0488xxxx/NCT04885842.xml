    <textblock>
      What remains the most important and common question for adult patients who want to undergo&#xD;
      orthodontic treatment is how long the treatment will take, as the period of orthodontic&#xD;
      treatment may take between 18 and 24 months in some cases of malocclusion ,and this may cause&#xD;
      discomfort for the patient and reduce cooperation during treatment in addition to the&#xD;
      aesthetic problems associated with presence of bracket.&#xD;
&#xD;
      the possibility of an increase of Enamel mineral dissolution and spread of dental caries&#xD;
      ,gingival problems and this is due to the increase of the duration of orthodontic treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Orthodontic treatment begins with the leveling and alignment stage and constitutes an&#xD;
      important part of the treatment stages, during which the teeth(incisal edges, cusps posterior&#xD;
      teeth) are placed on one level and to achieve perfect points of contact between the teeth In&#xD;
      some cases of malocclusion especially severe ones, this stage may take about 8 months&#xD;
      therefore , the interest of orthodontics has increased in finding new methods and techniques&#xD;
      in order to accelerate treatment, Various methods and techniques have been used to accelerate&#xD;
      orthodontic treatment Which includes :biomaterial injection, surgical and physical methods.&#xD;
      Yet, despite the effectiveness of some of these methods in accelerating dental movement ,each&#xD;
      of its disadvantages and side effects on the patient therefore, attention must be paid to&#xD;
      anther effective safe and simple non-traumatic method hence the idea of using platelet rich&#xD;
      fibrin came.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Platelet rich fibrin is a therapeutic approach and it is a new generation of platelet&#xD;
      concentrates Which was introduced to the field of dentistry by choukroun in 2001 who&#xD;
      developed this treatment technique.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Platelet rich fibrin injection technology (I-PRF), which is obtained in liquid form for&#xD;
      injection has been developed through the concept of reduced speed centrifugation .&#xD;
&#xD;
      PRF is a biomaterial .Autologus is taken from a person's own blood.Unlike PRP, no external&#xD;
      bioactive are added to active platelet. Rather, the blood sample remains normal. The&#xD;
      importance and therapeutic benefits of platelet-rich fibrin come through the presence of key&#xD;
      and other common elements that collectively contribute to the healing processes and&#xD;
      regeneration of the soft and bone tissues represented by the presence of fibrin in the form&#xD;
      of a matrix with large and significant numbers of leukocytes, cytokines, platelets, in&#xD;
      addition to the participation of growth factors which play an important role in the processes&#xD;
      of healing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Platelet rich fibrin is a simple, easy to apply and economical technique that does not&#xD;
      require adding any substances to the blood sample as an anticoagulant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To date, there are no studies on the role that platelet rich fibrin injection can play in&#xD;
      accelerating aligning and leveling the upper anterior teeth and reducing the time required&#xD;
      for treatments Therefore the aim of study is to verify the effectiveness of injection I-PRF&#xD;
      to accelerate alignment and leveling of the upper anterior teeth and reduce the time required&#xD;
      for treatment&#xD;
