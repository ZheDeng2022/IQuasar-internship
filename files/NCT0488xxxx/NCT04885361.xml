  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposed study is a phase 1 study which will evaluate the safety, reactogenicity and&#xD;
      immunogenicity of two doses regimen of CoVepiT vaccine (OSE-13E) in the population of n=48&#xD;
      healthy volunteers 18 to 45 (inclusive) years old, vaccinated or not by authorized COVID-19&#xD;
      vaccine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study will be open label and will be randomized 1:1 in two parallel study arms receiving&#xD;
      either one single dose or two doses separated by 21 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      First 4 subjects will serve as sentinel cohort and 7 days reactogenicity data of these&#xD;
      subjects will be reviewed by the independent safety monitoring committee (SMC) before&#xD;
      proceeding to the vaccination of remaining volunteers. The progress of the study will be&#xD;
      overviewed by a safety monitoring committee (SMC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The CoVepiT vaccine is a peptide-based vaccine aiming to induce CD8+T-cell-mediated immune&#xD;
      response against 11 different proteins of SARS-CoV-2 virus.&#xD;

             the subject if enrolled or could interfere with evaluation of the study vaccine or&#xD;
             interpretation of study results (including neurologic or psychiatric conditions deemed&#xD;
             likely to impair the quality of safety reporting).&#xD;
