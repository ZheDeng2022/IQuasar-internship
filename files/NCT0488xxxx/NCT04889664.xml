      The current project will evaluate the efficacy of adding Written Exposure Therapy (WET) to a&#xD;
      course of repeated IV ketamine infusions in prolonging PTSD symptom improvement/time to loss&#xD;
      of response in patients with chronic PTSD). WET is a brief, 5-session evidence-based written&#xD;
      trauma-focused therapy without in between-session assignments, with demonstrated efficacy and&#xD;
      low dropout rates in patients with PTSD. WET will be administered to all eligible&#xD;
      participants; the first WET sessions will be interleaved with the last two ketamine infusions&#xD;
      to take advantage of a window of increased neuroplasticity potentially induced by repeated&#xD;
      ketamine infusions. WET will be administered on different days as the ketamine infusions.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Current treatments for PTSD do not work for a significant proportion of individuals with&#xD;
      PTSD, or work only partially, leaving persistent and disabling residual symptoms. The&#xD;
      research team has led the development of ketamine for the treatment of chronic PTSD. After&#xD;
      the initial, proof-of-concept randomized controlled trial (RCT) of a single ketamine infusion&#xD;
      in individuals with chronic PTSD showed promising results, the study team recently completed&#xD;
      the first RCT of repeated intravenous ketamine infusions where individuals with chronic PTSD&#xD;
      received a course of six ketamine infusions (vs. active placebo midazolam infusions) and&#xD;
      demonstrated a rapid and robust improvement in PTSD symptoms. Median time to loss of&#xD;
      response, however, occurred a few weeks following the course of infusions, making it&#xD;
      imperative to investigate novel approaches aimed at preventing symptom relapse following&#xD;
      ketamine treatment. The study team proposes a proof-of-concept, open-label pilot study to&#xD;
      evaluate the efficacy of adding an evidence-based, brief and scalable trauma-focused&#xD;
      psychotherapy, Written Exposure Therapy (WET), to a course of ketamine infusions in&#xD;
      maintaining PTSD symptom improvement over time, in participants with chronic PTSD who respond&#xD;
      to initial ketamine infusions. To accomplish this aim, the study team will enroll individuals&#xD;
      who meet DSM-5 criteria for chronic PTSD. Eligible patients will receive a total of six&#xD;
      ketamine infusions and will participate in WET (a total of five sessions). The primary&#xD;
      outcome will be time to loss of response in patients who show an initial response to&#xD;
      ketamine, assessed with the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale for DSM-5. Additionally, all&#xD;
      participants will be assessed weekly until 12 weeks following the start of WET, regardless of&#xD;
      initial response to ketamine. Thereafter, participants who remain improved will be assessed&#xD;
      monthly for up to 24 weeks. The study team will also evaluate whether extinction learning&#xD;
      ability -assessed with a computerized extinction learning task- predicts maintenance of&#xD;
      ketamine response over time, and will explore potential sociodemographic and clinical&#xD;
      predictors of longer maintenance of ketamine response. If demonstrated to prolong time to&#xD;
      loss of response to ketamine, this novel combined treatment may represent a promising&#xD;
      intervention for individuals with chronic PTSD, deserving further study.&#xD;

             based on clinical assessment by a study psychiatrist and on the CAPS-5, and a&#xD;
             past-month total CAPS5 score â‰¥ 25 at screening - this is done to ensure at least&#xD;
             moderate severity and to safeguard against high placebo response rates;&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Women must be using a medically accepted reliable means of contraception (if using an&#xD;
             oral contraceptive medication, they must also be using a barrier contraceptive) or not&#xD;

             one year);&#xD;

&#xD;
          6. Men who are sexually active with women of childbearing potential must use a medically&#xD;
             accepted reliable means of contraception and must agree not to donate sperm for a&#xD;

&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Women who plan to become pregnant, are pregnant or are breast-feeding (because the&#xD;
             medical risk of using ketamine during pregnancy and breast-feeding is unknown);&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Serious, unstable medical illnesses such as hepatic, renal, gastroenterologic,&#xD;
             respiratory, cardiovascular, endocrinologic, neurologic, immunologic, or hematologic&#xD;
             disease, including gastro-esophageal reflux disease, obstructive sleep apnea, history&#xD;
             of difficulty with airway management during previous anesthetics, ischemic heart&#xD;

          5. Clinically significant uncorrected hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism, as indicated by&#xD;
             a TSH value 25% above or below the normal range;&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. A Body Mass Index (BMI) &gt;40;&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Hormonal treatment (e.g., estrogen) started in the 3 months prior to the first&#xD;
             infusion day;&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. History of a neurodevelopmental disorder (e.g., autism, pervasive developmental&#xD;
             disorder) ;&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. History of one or more seizures without a clear and resolved etiology;&#xD;

             anxiety;&#xD;
&#xD;
         18. Concurrent treatment with opioid medication, or with long-acting or daytime&#xD;
             short-acting benzodiazepines within two weeks of study start;&#xD;
