  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, and the associated government-imposed isolationary lockdowns, has&#xD;
      led to a mental health crisis on a global scale. Empirical studies have reported a drastic&#xD;
      increase in mental health problems, such as depression and anxiety, increased loneliness and&#xD;
      feelings of disconnectedness from others, while resilience levels have been negatively&#xD;
      affected, indicating an urgent need for intervention. The current study study is embedded in&#xD;
      a larger study, the CovSocial study (www.covsocial) which focused in its first phase on&#xD;
      evaluating the longitudinal changes in vulnerability, resilience and social cohesion during&#xD;
      the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. The present second phase of this CovSocial study will seek to&#xD;
      investigate the efficacy of brief online mindfulness-based and socio-emotional interventions&#xD;
      in reducing mental health problems, and enhancing psychological resilience, social&#xD;
      competencies and social cohesion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After providing informed consent, participants will be assigned to one of three groups: 1)&#xD;
      socio-emotional training group (with Affect Dyads as core exercise), 2) mindfulness-based&#xD;
      mental training group (with attention-based mindfulness practices such as Breathing&#xD;
      Meditation as core practice), or 3) Retest Control Group (waitlist control).All groups will&#xD;
      first undergo a pre-intervention testing phase (pre-test) wherein they will provide a&#xD;
      comprehensive baseline measurement which covers psychometric measures (such as questionnaires&#xD;
      and behavioral tasks), and biological parameters (saliva samples). During the 10-week&#xD;
      intervention period, participants will undergo weekly assessments and daily Ecological&#xD;
      Momentary Assessment pre and post the daily exercise practice, using self-report scales and&#xD;
      questionnaires delivered through a webapp or mobile app. At the end of the intervention,&#xD;
      participants will again undergo an assessment of psychometric measures and biological&#xD;
      parameters, same as at pre-intervention time (post-test). In a second portion, the waitlist&#xD;
      control group will undergo the socio-emotional intervention and will be tested at post-test&#xD;
      II again.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Results will reveal the effectiveness of brief online interventions in enhancing mental&#xD;
      health and social cohesion outcomes. In addition to examining pre-post intervention-related&#xD;
      changes, we will also use the data from the phase 1 of the project to evaluate the impact of&#xD;
      trait markers of and the longitudinal changes in vulnerability, resilience and social&#xD;
      cohesion on the intervention-related changes in markers of vulnerability, resilience and&#xD;
      social cohesion. We will also evaluate the predictive impact of genetic markers of&#xD;
      vulnerability, resilience and social cohesion (assessed in phase 1) on intervention-related&#xD;
      changes in our variables of interest.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The present study will serve as a pilot for future application of scalable, low-cost&#xD;
      interventions at a broader level to reduce stress, improve mental health and build resilience&#xD;
      in the face of global stressors.&#xD;

    <description>The retest control group, which is also a waitlist control group, will first not undergo an intervention, but will be tested prior to and after the 10-week period at Pre- and Post-test wherein other groups undergo the interventions.&#xD;
In a second step, the waitlist control group will then also undergo a 10-week period of socio-emotional intervention.&#xD;
During the first 10-week intervention period, this group will only be tested serving as a re-test control group. After Post-test, however, they will be given the chance to also enroll in a 10-week socio-emotional mental training with the exact same protocol as the socio-emotional intervention experimental group above.&#xD;
Both the experimental intervention arm groups will be given the possibility to continue their daily assigned practices (respective socio-emotional and mindfulness-based training exercises) after post-test for the duration of the 10-weeks during which the waitlist control group undergoes the socio-emotional intervention.</description>

    <description>Core practice: Affect Dyad. In the Affect Dyad (AD), participants perform a 12-minute partner-based exercise which involves contemplating over one difficult situation and one situation which incurred gratitude in the past 24 hours. Both partners take turns speaking about the two situations while the other partner listens in a non-judgmental manner. While the participants elaborate on the situations, they are asked to focus on the bodily experience of the emotions generated during the situation. The goal of the exercise is to enhance coping with difficult emotions, empathic listening, social sharing, acceptance, and gratitude.</description>

    <description>Core practice: Breathing Meditation. In this intervention, participants will practice 12-minute basic attention-based mindfulness meditation such as the Breathing Meditation (BM). BM is a 12-minute individual exercise that requires participants to focus their attention on the sensations of breathing. Participants have to sustain their attention to breath for long stretches of time, and have to return their attention to their breath when their mind wanders. The key focus is on training attention and interoceptive body awareness. Other practices participants will be taught is mindfulness on sounds (here the object of attention is not the breath but sounds in the environment).</description>
