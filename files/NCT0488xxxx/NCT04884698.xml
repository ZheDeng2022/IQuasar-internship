  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The scientific study is intended to show that external non-invasive electromagnetic&#xD;
      stimulation can be used to safely and effectively stimulate the phrenic nerve in awake&#xD;
      healthy subjects as well as in ventilated, anesthetized patients and that the stimulation can&#xD;
      generate a diaphragmatic contraction that generates significant breath volume - a Controlled&#xD;
      Own Breath (COB).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Also of interest is the reproducibility of the generated diaphragmatic movements and the&#xD;
      reliability of different feedback signals for detecting the generated diaphragmatic&#xD;
      contraction. This applies to inspiration and expiration detection for subsequent&#xD;
      synchronization mechanisms of the magnetic stimulator for patient-initiated breathing as well&#xD;
      as to contraction intensity. Further, the characterization of the position finding process is&#xD;
      of great importance, so that technical developments can further simplify the process of coil&#xD;
      positioning in the future. The possible occurrence of discomfort and pain sensation will also&#xD;
      be investigated in awake healthy volunteers. Different stimulation protocols will be used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Finally, it will be investigated whether an adjusted coil position still triggers&#xD;
      reproducible diaphragmatic contractions after removal and repositioning in the same&#xD;
      configuration. The knowledge gained will be used to further develop the technique and to&#xD;
      prepare a study in critically ill, ventilated patients where the diaphragmatic muscle is to&#xD;
      be treated preventively by stimulating the phrenic nerve, in order to prevent atrophy of the&#xD;
      muscle.&#xD;
