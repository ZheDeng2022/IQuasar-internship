  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, randomized, multi-center, interventional, active-controlled Phase 4&#xD;
      study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of CAZ-AVI versus BAT in the treatment of infected&#xD;
      participants with selected infection types (Hospital Acquired Pneumonia [HAP] (including&#xD;
      Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia [VAP]); Complicated Urinary-Tract Infection [cUTI];&#xD;
      Complicated Intra-Abdominal Infection [cIAI]; Bloodstream Infection [BSI]) due to&#xD;
      carbapenem-resistant Gram-negative pathogens in China.This study will be an estimation study.&#xD;
      The statistical inference will be based on point estimate and confidence interval.&#xD;
