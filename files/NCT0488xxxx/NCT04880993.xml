    <description>AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation subject administered a pharmaceutical product that does not necessarily have a causal relationship with the treatment. All AEs are classified according to version 23.1 of MedDRA and reported with respect to incidence, frequency, severity, duration, relationship to the investigational medicinal product, action taken, and outcome.</description>
