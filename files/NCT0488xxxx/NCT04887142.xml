  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary goal of the VIRIONUM project is to analyze the association of clinical,&#xD;
      socio-demographic characteristics of patients and their genetic polymorphism, inflammatory&#xD;
      and other biochemical markers with disease progression and death in subjects with COVID-19&#xD;
      disease. The research is an observational, cohort study with nested-case control design,&#xD;
      including adult, male and female COVID-19 inpatients. Primary dependent variable will be&#xD;
      outcome of disease, defined as discharge from the hospital or death. The outcomes and&#xD;
      putative risk factors will be analyzed using binary logistic regressions. The proposed multi-&#xD;
      and inter-disciplinary study should provide additional scientific evidence about risk factors&#xD;
      for the development of severe forms of the disease and the COVID-19-related death.&#xD;

      Background: Severe acute respiratory syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is etiological agent of&#xD;
      heterogeneous corona-virus disease 19 (COVID-19), which clinical condition range from&#xD;
      asymptomatic or mild to critically severe with high odds for fatal outcome. Since the&#xD;
      pathophysiological pathways of COVID-19 disease development are not fully elucidated,&#xD;
      resulting in repeated changes in treatment plans, there is an unmet need for more research&#xD;
      into genetic, biochemical, immunological, and clinical predictive indicators of better&#xD;
      outcomes in COVID-19 patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim: The VIRIONUM project's main aim is to investigate the relation between genetic&#xD;
      polymorphisms, inflammatory and other biochemical markers, and disease severity and mortality&#xD;
      in COVID-19-infected hospitalized patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Method and patients: The observational nested case-control clinical study will be conducted&#xD;
      in at least 1019 COVID-19 patients. The genetic polymorphisms (ACE2, IFNL3/4 and TMPRSS2),&#xD;
      serum concentration of soluble ACE2 and the pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines, blood&#xD;
      concentration of common inflammatory and other biomarkers, peripheral blood mononuclear&#xD;
      leukocyte (PBMC) phenotype, demographic and clinical risk factors will be monitored as&#xD;
      independent variables, while the dependent variables will be the outcome of the disease and&#xD;
      the severity of the clinical condition. Genotyping will be performed by Real-Time PCR method,&#xD;
      and serum concentrations of ACE2 and pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines by ELISA method,&#xD;
      and PBMC phenotype by flow cytometry. The disease severity will be assessed according to WHO&#xD;
      criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expected results: The findings of this clinical study will contribute to understanding of&#xD;
      significant genetic, biochemical, and clinical determinants of severity and lethal outcomes&#xD;
      in COVID-19 patients, as well as, creation of set of recommendations for individuals at&#xD;
      higher risk - future, evidence-based, targeted and individualized approach.&#xD;

        Adult patients of both sexes with different socio-demographic and clinical characteristics,&#xD;
        who were hospitalized due to COVID-19. The decision on hospitalization and further&#xD;
        treatment of patients is at the discretion of the attending physicians. All participants&#xD;
        will be prospectively followed during their hospital stay. Patients will be included in the&#xD;
        study if they are at least 18 years old and if they give voluntary written consent to&#xD;
        participate. Pregnant and breastfeeding women, patients transferred from other hospitals&#xD;
        and those who die during the first 24 hours of hospitalization will be excluded. In this&#xD;
        study, stratification of participants according to age to those older than 65 years and&#xD;
        younger is provided only for the purposes of statistical data processing and analyse.&#xD;
