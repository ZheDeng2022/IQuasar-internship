      Retrospective observational multicentric, spontaneous non-interventional non-pharmacological&#xD;
      Italian study. The primary objective is analysis of Anti-HLA antibodies and DSAs searching&#xD;
      and monitoring activities in haematological adult and paediatric patients undergoing&#xD;
      allo-HSCT from January 2014 to June 2017. This study will evaluate approximately 1000&#xD;
      subjects (with competitive enrolment) from GITMO investigational centers.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to evaluate, retrospectively, the activity of the Italian Centres in&#xD;
      the search for donor-specific anti-HLA antibodies (DSAs) in patients undergoing allogeneic&#xD;
      hematopoietic stem cell transplantation from mismatched donors and the strategy of treatment&#xD;
      employed in case of DSAs positivity. Moreover, the study aims are to evaluate the role of&#xD;
      DSAs on the engraftment. The interest in the study arises from the absence of knowledge on&#xD;
      the MFI cut-off value clinically significant, and from the absence of the knowledge on the&#xD;
      role of DSAs against each HLA locus on the engraftment and post-transplant survival.&#xD;
      Furthermore, shared desensitization protocols and common donor selection strategies are&#xD;
      lacking.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In recent years, with the increase of haploidentical and mismatched unrelated donor&#xD;
      transplants, is also increasing the interest for DSAs at the time of HSCT, considering their&#xD;
      potential role on graft failure by cell-mediated or antibody-mediated mechanisms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Having a picture of the policy about DSAs management in Italian Transplant Centers, and of&#xD;
      the indications reported by the Histocompatibility and Immunogenetic Laboratories, will allow&#xD;
      to define, in collaboration with GITMO / AIBT, a consensus strategy. This strategy could be&#xD;
      the platform for prospective studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study involves the enrolment of patients (adults and paediatrics) undergoing mismatched&#xD;
      allogeneic transplant, in the period 2014-2017 regardless of the source of stem cells and the&#xD;
      search for DSAs. The sample size includes all the transplants recorded in the Gruppo Italiano&#xD;
      Trapianti di Midollo Osseo and European group for Blood and Marrow Transplantation database.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objectives are two: the analysis of Anti-HLA antibodies and DSAs searching and&#xD;
      monitoring activities in haematological patients undergoing Allogeneic Hematopoietic Stem&#xD;
      Cell Transplantation (HSCT) performed by Histocompatibility and Immunogenetic Laboratories in&#xD;
      collaboration with Italian transplant centres and assess to the impact of DSAs on neutrophil&#xD;
      and platelet engraftment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objectives are to study the probability and times to neutrophils and platelets&#xD;
      engraftment, reject, poor engraftment in patients undergoing HSCT among different transplant&#xD;
      centres, according to anti-HLA antibodies and DSA testing practice and assess the Overall&#xD;
      Survival (OS) in patients undergoing HSCT with or without DSAs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The analysis of continuous and categorical variables will be performed according to the&#xD;
      criteria of descriptive statistics, including mean, median, standard deviation, range,&#xD;
      minimum and maximum values for continuous variables, absolute and relative values for&#xD;
      categorical variables. For the comparison of continuous and categorical variables, parametric&#xD;
      and non-parametric statistical tests (Chi-square test, Fisher exact test and rank correlation&#xD;
      coefficient of Spearman) will be applied. Competitive risk analysis will be used to assess&#xD;
      the cumulative incidence (CI) of engraftment, considering death within 60 days as a&#xD;
      competitive event.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OS will be estimated according to the Kaplan-Meier method and calculated from the date of the&#xD;
      transplant; the comparison between different groups will be performed with the log-rank test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Cox regression model for proportional hazards will be used for multivariate analysis in&#xD;
      order to evaluate the prognostic effect of the various variables in terms of engraftment. For&#xD;
      the statistical analysis, a p-value &lt;0.05 will be considered statistically significant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This trial is being organized under the auspices of the Gruppo Italiano Trapianti di Midollo&#xD;
      Osseo that involves the principal Centres active in transplantation of any kind of&#xD;
      hematopoietic stem cells (HSCT) in Italy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be conducted according to the principles of Good Clinical Practice, the&#xD;
      current Italian and European laws and regulations, in agreement with the declaration of&#xD;
      Helsinki. The protocol has been written and the study will be conducted according to The&#xD;
      International Council for Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Pharmaceuticals for&#xD;
      Human Use (ICH) Harmonized Tripartite Guideline for Good Clinical Practice, issued by the&#xD;
      European Union. The responsible Local Ethical Committee approval must be obtained before&#xD;
      starting the trial. A copy of the patient informed consent form must be submitted to the&#xD;
      appropriate authority or committee, together with the protocol for written approval. Written&#xD;
      approval of the protocol and informed consent by the responsible and appropriate authority or&#xD;
      committee must be obtained prior to recruitment of patients to the study.&#xD;
