      Preventing Pressure Injuries among patients undergoing spinal or orthopedic surgery in the&#xD;
      prone position is challenging because of position required for surgical access and limited&#xD;
      availability of pressure reduction surfaces for prone position operating tables. A new&#xD;
      dressing technology (Mepilex Border Flex® (MBF) provides increased conformability of the&#xD;
      dressing to the skin with the ability of the dressing to move in all directions (e.g.,&#xD;
      360-degree flexibility) with even slight body movements. Limited data exists on use of&#xD;
      silicone foam dressings with all direction flexibility during prone surgical procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We plan to recruit participants scheduled for surgery in the prone position at UCLA Santa&#xD;
      Monica Medical Center and propose to examine use of the MBF dressings on the chest, iliac&#xD;
      crest, and face (chin, cheeks, forehead) of patients undergoing this type of surgery using a&#xD;
      prospective, non-randomized pre/post intervention clinical trial design.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Three outcome measures will be compared between patients undergoing prone surgery with&#xD;
      standard care (no dressings, pressure reduction positioning on the operating table) and those&#xD;
      with standard care and use of MBF dressings placed on the chest, iliac crest and face. First,&#xD;
      we will compare incidence of erythema and pressure injuries on face, chest and iliac crest&#xD;
      determined by visual skin assessment between the two groups. Next, we will compare incidence&#xD;
      of moisture associated skin damage (MASD) and friction abrasions on face, chest and iliac&#xD;
      crest determined by visual skin assessment between the two groups. Last, we will compare SEM&#xD;
      measures indicative of pressure injury damage on face, chest, iliac crest between the two&#xD;
      groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will also complete a 6-month retrospective medical record review of patients who underwent&#xD;
      prone surgeries from February 1, 2018 through July 31, 2018 to determine a historical&#xD;
      pressure injury facility incident rate. The year 2018 was chosen to avoid changes associated&#xD;
      with the COVID-19 pandemic.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Preventing pressure injuries (PrIs) from developing during surgery is difficult due to&#xD;
      insensitivity and immobility of the patient and the positioning needed for safe surgical&#xD;
      access. Intraoperative acquired pressure injury (IAPI) rates are reported from 4% to 45% (1).&#xD;
      IAPI rates vary due to differences in defining PrIs, surgical positions and because tissue&#xD;
      damage that occurs in surgery may not be visible on the skin surface initially with the&#xD;
      resulting PrI presenting several days post operatively (2,3). The sustained pressure,&#xD;
      deformation, and shear forces on the tissues combined with changes in blood flow due to blood&#xD;
      loss, vasopressor and anesthesia use, and temperature changes present unique risk factors for&#xD;
      PrI development during surgery (1). Reducing PrI damage during surgery requires preventive&#xD;
      strategies to decrease the mechanical forces of pressure and shear on the tissues loaded in&#xD;
      the unique positions required for surgical access. In the supine position for surgery, use of&#xD;
      silicone foam dressings on the sacrum and heels with pressure reducing devices on the&#xD;
      operating table have decreased IAPIs (4, 5).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preventing PrIs among patients undergoing spinal or orthopedic surgery in the prone position&#xD;
      is especially challenging because of positioning required for surgical access and limited&#xD;
      availability of pressure reduction surfaces for prone positioner operating tables (2,6). The&#xD;
      face, chest, and iliac crest are all loaded in the prone position. These anatomic locations&#xD;
      have limited soft tissue for compression and small surface areas and because of this,&#xD;
      distribution of pressure and shear forces over a large surface area is not possible. Thus,&#xD;
      the intensity of the pressure and shear force over these anatomic areas is high. Shear force&#xD;
      is particularly problematic as tissues change due to variations in blood volume and flow,&#xD;
      anesthesia, and vasopressor use during the surgical procedure all of which may increase shear&#xD;
      forces on the tissues (2). Use of silicone foam dressings on the iliac crest and chest has&#xD;
      been shown to reduce IAPIs in the prone position for spinal surgery (6). Most recently, use&#xD;
      of silicone foam dressings has decreased PrIs in patients with acute respiratory distress&#xD;
      syndrome (ARDS) from COVID-19 who are placed in prone position to manage respiratory distress&#xD;
      (7,8). Issues with use of silicone foam dressings intraoperatively is keeping the dressing in&#xD;
      place while positioning for surgery, protecting the skin and allowing for movement and&#xD;
      changes in the tissues. A new dressing technology (Mepilex Border Flex® (MBF)) provides&#xD;
      increased conformability of the dressing to the skin with the ability of the dressing to move&#xD;
      in all directions (e.g., 360-degree flexibility) with even slight body movements. Limited&#xD;
      data exists on use of silicone foam dressings with all direction flexibility during prone&#xD;
      surgical procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We propose to examine use of MBF dressings on the chest, iliac crest, and face (chin, cheeks,&#xD;
      forehead) of patients undergoing surgery in a prone position using a prospective,&#xD;
      non-randomized pre/post-intervention clinical trial. The specific aims are to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Compare IAPI, erythema, and skin damage (e.g., friction abrasions, moisture associated&#xD;
           skin damage (MASD)) incidence at chest, iliac crest, and face of patients undergoing&#xD;
           surgery in a prone position with use of standard care (no dressings, pressure reduction&#xD;
           positioning on the operating table) to use of MBF dressings placed on chest, iliac&#xD;
           crest, and face with standard care.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Compare subepidermal moisture (SEM) values (a biophysical measure of inflammatory tissue&#xD;
           changes), at chest, iliac crest, and face of patients undergoing surgery in a prone&#xD;
           position with use of standard care (no dressings, pressure reduction positioning on the&#xD;
           operating table) to use of MBF dressings placed on chest, iliac crest, and face along&#xD;
           with standard care.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Explore cost estimates for use of MBF dressings placed on chest, iliac crest, and face&#xD;
           for surgery in a prone position.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients undergoing surgery are at high risk for pressure injuries (PrIs) (1,2). In addition&#xD;
      to increasing risk of death, infection, and hospital length of stay, PrIs among surgical&#xD;
      patients increases hospital costs by 44% per hospital stay (1,3). Preventing PrIs from&#xD;
      developing during surgery is difficult due to insensitivity to pain and immobility of the&#xD;
      patient and the specialized positioning needed for safe surgical access. Intraoperative&#xD;
      Acquired Pressure Injury (IAPI) rates are reported ranging from 4% to 45% (1, 4-8). IAPI&#xD;
      rates vary due to surgical positions and because tissue damage that occurs in surgery may not&#xD;
      be visible initially on the skin surface with the resulting PrI presenting several days post&#xD;
      operatively (9). The sustained pressure, deformation, and shear forces on the tissues&#xD;
      combined with changes in blood flow due to blood loss, vasopressor and anesthesia use, and&#xD;
      temperature changes present unique challenges for PrI development during surgery (1,2).&#xD;
      Reducing PrI damage during surgery requires preventive strategies to decrease the mechanical&#xD;
      forces of pressure and shear on the tissues loaded in the unique positions required for&#xD;
      surgical access. In the supine position for surgery, use of silicone foam dressings on the&#xD;
      sacrum and heels along with pressure reducing devices on the operating table have decreased&#xD;
      IAPIs (10-13).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The prone position for surgery has been shown to be a risk factor for IAPIs in multiple&#xD;
      studies (1,2,4,14). Yet, there is limited data on IAPIs for surgeries in the prone position&#xD;
      with Luo and colleagues reporting incidence at 4.7% and Yoshimura et al showing an 11%&#xD;
      incidence (4,15). Preventing PrIs among patients undergoing spinal or orthopedic surgery in&#xD;
      the prone position is especially challenging because of positioning required for surgical&#xD;
      access and limited availability of pressure reduction surfaces for prone positioner operating&#xD;
      tables (2,15). The face, chest, and iliac crest are all loaded on small operating table&#xD;
      surfaces in the prone position. These anatomic locations have limited soft tissue for&#xD;
      compression and small surface areas and because of this, distribution of pressure and shear&#xD;
      forces over a large surface area is not possible. Thus, the intensity of the pressure and&#xD;
      shear force over these anatomic areas is high. Shear force is particularly problematic as&#xD;
      tissues change due to variations in blood volume and flow, anesthesia and vasopressor use,&#xD;
      and initiation of the inflammatory response during the surgical procedure all of which may&#xD;
      increase shear forces on the tissues (1,2,16). Use of silicone foam dressings on the iliac&#xD;
      crest and chest has been shown to reduce IAPIs in the prone position for spinal surgery (15).&#xD;
      Most recently, use of silicone foam dressings has been suggested for use to decrease PrIs in&#xD;
      patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) from COVID-19 who are placed in&#xD;
      prone position to manage respiratory distress (17,18). Issues with use of silicone foam&#xD;
      dressings intraoperatively is keeping the dressing in place while positioning for surgery&#xD;
      preoperatively, protecting the skin and allowing for movement and changes in the tissues&#xD;
      intraoperatively, and safe nontraumatic removal immediately postoperatively. A new dressing&#xD;
      technology (Mepilex Border Flex® (MBF)) provides increased conformability of the dressing to&#xD;
      the skin with the ability of the dressing to move in all directions (e.g., 360-degree&#xD;
      flexibility) with even slight body movements while using a silicone-based adhesive allowing&#xD;
      for atraumatic removal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We propose to examine use of MBF dressings on the chest, iliac crest, and face (chin, cheeks,&#xD;
      forehead) of patients undergoing surgery in a prone position using a prospective,&#xD;
      non-randomized pre/post-intervention clinical trial design. Three outcome measures will be&#xD;
      compared between patients undergoing prone surgery with standard care (no dressings, pressure&#xD;
      reduction positioning on the operating table) and those with standard care and use of MBF&#xD;
      dressings placed on chest, iliac crest, and face. First, we will compare incidence of&#xD;
      erythema and PrIs on face, chest, and iliac crest determined by visual skin assessment&#xD;
      between the two groups. Next, we will compare incidence of moisture associated skin damage&#xD;
      (MASD) and friction abrasions on face, chest, and iliac crest determined by visual skin&#xD;
      assessment between the two groups. Last, we will compare SEM measures indicative of PrI&#xD;
      damage on face, chest, iliac crest between the two groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will also complete a 6-month retrospective medical record review of patients who underwent&#xD;
      prone surgeries from February 1, 2018 through July 31, 2018 to determine a historical PrI&#xD;
      facility incidence rate. The year 2018 was chosen to avoid changes associated with the&#xD;
      COVID-19 pandemic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Setting and Subjects After approval by The University of California, Los Angeles, Office of&#xD;
      the Human Research Protection Program and the UCLA Medical Center Nursing Research Council we&#xD;
      will obtain written informed consent to participate in the study directly from patients who&#xD;
      are able to provide informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two surgical groups, the neurological and the orthopedic surgery groups, will be used to&#xD;
      recruit participants scheduled for surgery in the prone position to be conducted at UCLA&#xD;
      Santa Monica Medical Center. UCLA Santa Monica Medical Center performs about 15 prone&#xD;
      surgeries per week. Participant inclusion criteria are patients scheduled to undergo&#xD;
      orthopedic or neuro surgery in prone position, over 18 years of age, able to understand&#xD;
      English, and able to provide informed self-consent. Exclusions to participation include less&#xD;
      than 18 years old, inability to provide informed consent, and scheduled for surgery in a&#xD;
      position other than prone position. We will also conduct a 6-month retrospective medical&#xD;
      record review of patients who underwent prone surgery between February 1, 2018 through July&#xD;
      31, 2018 to determine the historical PrI incidence for UCLA Santa Monica Medical Center.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Protocol The study data collection period is anticipated to be 6 months, 3 months of&#xD;
      pre-intervention baseline assessments followed by 3 months of intervention assessments.&#xD;
      COVID-19 precautions will be in place throughout all study related activities and will follow&#xD;
      UCLA Health Center guidelines: all parties will wear cloth face mask and a plastic face&#xD;
      shield, 2-minute hand hygiene using soap and water and&#xD;
&#xD;
      hand sanitizer for use, gloves and gowns prior to any contact, and maintain social distance&#xD;
      (&gt;6') between all activities as possible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pre-intervention Baseline. During pre-intervention baseline (3 months) participants will&#xD;
      undergo visual skin assessment and SEM Scanner readings at face (chin, cheeks, forehead),&#xD;
      chest and iliac crest, conducted by the research staff, preoperatively, immediately following&#xD;
      surgery in the Post Anesthesia Recovery (PAR) Unit, on transfer to the floor unit,&#xD;
      post-operative day 3 and post-operative day 5 or discharge from hospital (whichever occurs&#xD;
      first).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention. During intervention (3 months) participants will undergo visual skin assessment&#xD;
      and SEM Scanner readings at face (chin, cheeks, forehead), chest and iliac crest, conducted&#xD;
      by the research staff and then placement of MBF dressings to the face (chin, cheeks,&#xD;
      forehead), chest and iliac crest, conducted by the research staff immediately following&#xD;
      surgery with the MBF dressings removed in the PAR unit, on transfer to the floor unit,&#xD;
      post-operative day 3 and post-operative day 5 or discharge from hospital (whichever occurs&#xD;
      first).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Collection Research staff will collect all data after training in all protocols by the&#xD;
      PI. Data collection includes medical record abstraction, visual skin assessments, and SEM&#xD;
      Scanner measures. Each is described below.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Medical record abstraction. The electronic medical record (EPIC) will be abstracted for&#xD;
      demographic data (gender, age, race/ethnicity) and medical data (height, weight, body mass&#xD;
      index, comorbidities such as diabetes, hypertension, peripheral vascular disease and, smoking&#xD;
      status, medical diagnoses, Braden Scale for predicting Pressure Sores (Braden) score, use of&#xD;
      any PrI preventive strategies such as support surface use, repositioning schedules), surgery&#xD;
      type, surgery length, use of vibration machines or other instruments in surgery, length of&#xD;
      time in PAR unit, anesthesia used, use of vasopressors during surgery, estimated blood loss,&#xD;
      volume of fluids provided during surgery, blood pressure during surgery, American Society of&#xD;
      Anesthesiologists physical status score and documentation of any skin damage including PrIs,&#xD;
      MASD, and friction abrasions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will also conduct a 6-month retrospective medical record review of patients who underwent&#xD;
      prone surgery between February 1, 2018 through July 31, 2018 to determine the historical PrI&#xD;
      incidence for UCLA Santa Monica Medical Center. The retrospective medical record review will&#xD;
      include data as noted above. The time period for the retrospective medical record review was&#xD;
      chosen to align temporally with the prospective data to be collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visual Skin Assessment. Visual skin assessment training of research staff will emphasize&#xD;
      stage 1 PrIs and deep tissue injury (DTI), a PrI that begins at the muscle tissue interface&#xD;
      and presents as deeply discolored skin, because these conditions may be difficult to detect.&#xD;
      Research staff will assess skin health through direct visual assessments preoperatively or&#xD;
      within 1 week of scheduled surgery, immediately after surgery in PAR unit, on transfer to the&#xD;
      floor unit, post-operative days 3 and 5 or discharge whichever occurs first. Participants are&#xD;
      positioned in bed in a supine position for visual assessments. Eight anatomic locations will&#xD;
      be assessed: right and left chest at nipple line, iliac crest, and cheeks, mid forehead and&#xD;
      chin. Skin is assessed for discoloration (redness), erythema, PrI, MASD, and friction&#xD;
      abrasion. Areas of visual skin discoloration are palpated for blanchability using finger&#xD;
      palpation (press tissues with finger firmly for 5 seconds, release, and look for return of&#xD;
      normal skin color) and defined as blanchable versus non-blanchable. Erythema is graded as&#xD;
      minimal, moderate, or severe discoloration, where minimal was defined as pink or slight&#xD;
      redness to the skin, moderate as bright redness in lightly pigmented skin and purple in&#xD;
      darkly pigmented skin, and severe as dark red to purple in lightly pigmented skin and black&#xD;
      to blue-grey colors in darkly pigmented skin. Erythema is defined as moderate skin&#xD;
      discoloration (bright redness in light skin tones and purple in dark skin tones), with&#xD;
      blanching (blanching not considered for dark skin tones). DTI is defined as&#xD;
&#xD;
      severe skin discoloration (purple or maroon in light skin tones and black to blue-grey in&#xD;
      dark skin tones) with or without blanching. Stage 1 PrIs are defined as moderate skin&#xD;
      discoloration (all skin tones), with non-blanching (non dark skin tones). PrIs more severe&#xD;
      than stage 1 will be classified using the EPUAP/NPIAP/PPPIA's 2019 staging system (1) and&#xD;
      assessed using the Bates-Jensen Wound Assessment Tool (BWAT) (32). For skin that demonstrates&#xD;
      none of the above visual characteristics, the assessment is considered normal skin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subepidermal Moisture Measure. The SEM readings will be obtained on clean dry skin directly&#xD;
      over each anatomic location using the SEM Scanner (Bruin Biometrics, Los Angeles, CA), a&#xD;
      handheld dermal phase meter that requires light skin touch and provides SEM readings in 3&#xD;
      seconds (range 0-7 picoFarads (pF)) concurrently with the visual skin assessments. The SEM&#xD;
      Scanner uses dielectric parameters, high-frequency low power electromagnetic waves of 32 kHz&#xD;
      are transmitted via an electrode that is manually placed on the skin surface. In the skin,&#xD;
      the induced electrical field interacts mainly with water molecules closest to the electrode&#xD;
      with depth of interaction depending on the diameter of the circular electrode (in this study&#xD;
      at a depth of 4mm) (19-21). The portion of the electromagnetic energy that is not absorbed by&#xD;
      tissue water is reflected and measured by the device and displayed in the measuring unit. SEM&#xD;
      values are displayed in picoFarads. Reliability of the device has been previously reported&#xD;
      (33).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Descriptive statistics will be used to describe the sample. Chi square (categorical data),&#xD;
      t-tests (continuous data) and Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) will be used as appropriate to&#xD;
      compare demographic and medical data between the two groups (standard care versus MBF&#xD;
      dressings) and to compare the total sample to the retrospective historical sample. Chi square&#xD;
      (categorical data), t-tests (continuous data) and Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) will be used&#xD;
      as appropriate to compare incidence and severity of PrI, erythema, MASD, friction abrasions,&#xD;
      and SEM values between groups (standard care versus MSB dressings) and to compare the total&#xD;
      sample incidence of PrIs and skin damage to documented PrIs and skin damage determined from&#xD;
      the retrospective historical sample.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Costs of the dressings will be described.&#xD;
