  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is more prevalent and has more impact on health&#xD;
      status because of progressive air pollution, tobacco smoking and aging society. The COPD&#xD;
      prevalence investigation in 2013 by phone call showed at least 6% of the population with more&#xD;
      than 40 years-old in Taiwan. It also was the 7th ranking of death causes in Taiwan then.&#xD;
      Apart from chronic inflammation in lung and deteriorated lung function, it had extrapulmonary&#xD;
      complications, such as cardiovascular problems, osteoporosis and muscle wasting. The concept&#xD;
      of sarcopenia was proposed at first in 1989. It increases the risk of falls, disability and&#xD;
      lowering life quality. Besides, it increased the mortality risk after admission from acute&#xD;
      ward. Thereafter, sarcopenia is one of COPD co-morbidities, which should have great impacts&#xD;
      of COPD. The studies showed sarcopenia reduced exercise capacities and worsening dyspnea&#xD;
      scores. On the other hand, COPD exacerbation brings significant health burden. But there is&#xD;
      limited data about the effect on sarcopenia on COPD exacerbation. We conducted a prospective&#xD;
      observational study. We measured skeletal muscle mass and the strength of the used hand grip&#xD;
      within 3 days of admission and before discharge. Mortality and exacerbation in one year are&#xD;
      the primary end-points&#xD;
