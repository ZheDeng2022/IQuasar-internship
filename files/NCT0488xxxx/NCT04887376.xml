  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study was conducted to determine whether mirror therapy has an additive effect on&#xD;
      cross-education of the strength of neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES) in patients&#xD;
      with hemiplegia. As an outcome measure, the ankle dorsiflexion strength of hemiplegic&#xD;
      patients was measured.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A total of 29 patients, 7 women, and 22 men were included according to the inclusion and&#xD;
      exclusion criteria. The patients were randomly assigned to the control group (n = 14) and the&#xD;
      Mirror group (n = 15). Five sessions of neuromuscular electrical stimulation, unaffected side&#xD;
      ankle dorsiflexors were applied to the patients in both groups. In addition to the NMES,&#xD;
      mirror therapy was applied to the experimental group simultaneously with NMES. Before and&#xD;
      after treatment, both ankle dorsiflexor strength was measured with a force sensor. For force&#xD;
      measurements, a force transducer (FC2211-0000-0100-L Compression Load Cell, TE Connectivity&#xD;
      company, France) was used. Force transducer signals were received with a data acquisition&#xD;
      device (POWERLAB® data acquisition system ADInstruments, Oxford, UK) and evaluated offline on&#xD;
      the computer. The measurement values were expressed in kilogram.force (kg.f) and this value&#xD;
      was normalized according to body weight.&#xD;
