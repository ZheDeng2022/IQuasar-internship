  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aimed to evaluate the association between the isokinetic knee strength and/or&#xD;
      proprioception performance with the functional performance on the functional Hop-tests and&#xD;
      Y-balance test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study included 20 healthy individuals who performed an isokinetic assessment of knee&#xD;
      proprioception (joint position sense, JPS and threshold to detection of passive motion, TDPM)&#xD;
      and flexors/extensors strength. At the same time, they performed a functional testing&#xD;
      consisting of three Hop-tests (single, triple and cross-over) and the Lower Quarter Y-Balance&#xD;
      Test (YBT-LQ). We tested the correlation between the isokinetic and functional performances,&#xD;
      and limb symmetry indexes.&#xD;

    <description>Hop test. Single hop: Patients are instructed to stand on one leg and perform 1 jump as far as possible, landing on the same leg.&#xD;
The total distance is recorded (in cm) .Triple hop: Patients are instructed to stand on one leg and perform 3 hops as far as possible, landing on the same leg.&#xD;
The total distance for 3 consecutive hops is recorded (in cm). Cross-over hop test : The patient hops forward 3 times while alternately crossing over a marking The patient is instructed to position themselves such that the first of the 3 hops was lateral with respect to the direction of crossover The total distance hopped forward is recorded (in cm)</description>
