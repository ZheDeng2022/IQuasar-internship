  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The research study is being conducted to test the safety and effectiveness of the&#xD;
      experimental drug mosunetuzumab when given after CAR (genetically modified) T cells. The&#xD;
      study is for patients who have already received a CAR T-cell infusion. Some patients who join&#xD;
      the study will receive mosunetuzumab, other patients later in the study may receive a&#xD;
      different experimental drug (glofitamab).&#xD;
