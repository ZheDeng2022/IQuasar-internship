  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is a pressing need to develop more effective interventions to remediate cognitive&#xD;
      deficits in highly prevalent disabling conditions such as stroke, head injury and other forms&#xD;
      of acquired brain injury (ABI). Neuropsychological rehabilitation interventions developed in&#xD;
      a clinical setting have shown some beneficial effects, but the effectiveness of clinical&#xD;
      interventions have potential to be enhanced if informed by findings from cognitive&#xD;
      neuroscience. Research into cognitive training using methods such as functional magnetic&#xD;
      resonance imaging (fMRI) has contributed to an understanding of factors that promote changes&#xD;
      in brain function, but this approach seldom includes individuals with brain damage or&#xD;
      cognitive deficits. Its potential for application with clinical populations is therefore&#xD;
      uncertain, meaning that people who may benefit do not have access to interventions that may&#xD;
      improve their health and wellbeing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed research brings together methods from neuropsychological rehabilitation and&#xD;
      cognitive neuroscience to investigate 1) the feasibility of, and effect sizes arising from,&#xD;
      combining an existing clinical intervention targeting mental strategies with an adaptive&#xD;
      training programme targeting core cognitive processes, and 2) whether the novel treatment&#xD;
      combination promotes changes in brain function that are detectable using fMRI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This project will develop and evaluate a training intervention that aims to improve outcomes&#xD;
      from a strategy-based rehabilitation intervention, Goal Management Training (GMT), by adding&#xD;
      process-based cognitive training with adaptive difficulty to enhance the executive function&#xD;
      of working memory updating (WMU). People with ABI (n=32) will complete 9 sessions of GMT, a&#xD;
      recommended treatment for deficits in frontal-lobe executive functions, with the addition of&#xD;
      8 WMU training sessions with or without adaptive training. Measures of feasibility,&#xD;
      acceptability, and fidelity will be taken, and effect sizes of differences in pre- to&#xD;
      post-training changes on neural, cognitive, and functional measurements will be determined by&#xD;
      comparing two experimental groups in which difficulty of the WMU training tasks either&#xD;
      adaptively increases in response to performance or is fixed.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Globally, stroke and head injury are leading causes of disability. Deficits in cognitive&#xD;
      functions are common in these conditions, including impairment in frontal-lobe 'executive'&#xD;
      functions such as working memory and the ability to solve problems, plan, and regulate&#xD;
      actions in order to achieve intended goals. These deficits affect individuals' ability to&#xD;
      live independently, work, and maintain social relationships. We propose that improving&#xD;
      outcomes for people with acquired brain injury (ABI) requires an interdisciplinary approach&#xD;
      in which neuropsychological rehabilitation and cognitive neuroscience complement one another.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In neuropsychological rehabilitation, interventions are classified as 'restorative'&#xD;
      (restoration of underlying core cognitive processes including executive functions) or&#xD;
      'compensatory' (compensation of function through the use of external aids or learned&#xD;
      strategies). Clinical guidelines recommend the use of 'meta-cognitive strategy training' for&#xD;
      the treatment of deficits in frontal-lobe executive functions. Goal Management Training (GMT)&#xD;
      is one such validated meta-cognitive strategy. GMT trains compensatory mental strategies to&#xD;
      manage attention during multi-step tasks. GMT has been evaluated behaviourally in randomised&#xD;
      controlled trials with positive, albeit modest, outcomes in individuals with ABI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In cognitive neuroscience, an emerging research area concerns experience-induced neural&#xD;
      changes referred to as neural plasticity. These may involve neural changes in: 1) task-based&#xD;
      functional activation patterns, i.e. activity increases, decreases, or reorganisation, 2)&#xD;
      brain structure, i.e., grey matter and white matter volume changes and 3) functional&#xD;
      connectivity, i.e. changes in connectivity between brain regions that are recruited for a&#xD;
      mental procedure as well as changes in the strength and magnitude.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Neuroimaging studies have demonstrated that programmes to train core cognitive processes&#xD;
      including working memory (WM) executive functions can drive changes both in behavioural and&#xD;
      neural measures. Performance gains after process-based training have been observed by several&#xD;
      authors employing different training tasks and including both younger and older populations.&#xD;
      In addition, generalisation to broad cognitive abilities such as reasoning, episodic memory,&#xD;
      after process-based training, has been observed in both young and older adults although this&#xD;
      area is under debate. This work has primarily involved healthy adults and whether the same&#xD;
      findings apply to those with ABI needs to be investigated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This research study aims to develop and evaluate a novel treatment intervention for people&#xD;
      with ABI that combines a process-based cognitive training with a strategy-based GMT&#xD;
      rehabilitation intervention, and to acquire functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data&#xD;
      before and after the intervention to measure patterns of brain activity associated with a&#xD;
      task requiring executive functions. We propose that outcomes from GMT might be improved by an&#xD;
      adaptive, process-based intervention aimed at enhancing working memory processes. Adaptive&#xD;
      task difficulty involves dynamic adjustment of training task demands so that the individual&#xD;
      remains within an optimal range of performance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      i. Aims&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary aim of the study is to investigate whether it is feasible and acceptable to&#xD;
      deliver a novel intervention combining GMT with WMU training, within a randomised controlled&#xD;
      trial (RCT) context in a sample of ABI individuals. A further aim is to examine the&#xD;
      behavioural and neural changes related to the novel intervention as well as the effect sizes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ii. Research Question&#xD;
&#xD;
      This project will combine methods from neuropsychological rehabilitation and cognitive&#xD;
      neuroscience to answer the following: 1) Is it feasible to combine an existing treatment for&#xD;
      executive dysfunction, GMT, with an adaptive WMU training and how much benefit is gained? 2)&#xD;
      Does the novel treatment combination promote neural plasticity that is detectable using fMRI?&#xD;
&#xD;
      iii. Outcomes&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary outcomes will be measures of feasibility, acceptability, and fidelity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcomes will be pre- to post-training change in behavioural data (i.e.,&#xD;
      neuro-psychological assessment battery, measures of cognitive task performance and everyday&#xD;
      functioning) and fMRI data (i.e., task-related brain activity), analysed by training&#xD;
      condition. In addition, exploratory analyses of individual differences in responsiveness to&#xD;
      WMU training will be performed, by calculating correlations between amount of adaptive&#xD;
      training task improvement and pre- to post-training change on neural, cognitive, and&#xD;
      functional measurements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      iv. Design&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomised controlled trial methodology; specifically stratified randomisation in conjunction&#xD;
      with permuted block random allocation, using an active control group will compare two&#xD;
      conditions: (1) GMT combined with adaptive training [AT]; (2) GMT combined with non-adaptive&#xD;
      [NA] training. Thirty-two adults with non-progressive ABI sustained in adulthood will be&#xD;
      recruited from the NHS.. Participants will complete a combination of standard GMT (9&#xD;
      sessions) and 8 WMU (AT or NA) training sessions, delivered in small groups.&#xD;
      Neuropsychological and functional assessments will be performed before and after the&#xD;
      intervention. In addition, fMRI scanning sessions will be conducted pre- and post-training&#xD;

    <description>GMT teaches the use of mental strategies to support sustained attention during complex (multi-step) task performance following an interactive programme. GMT is structured into nine modules, with interactive discussions and homework assignments. It will be conducted on a group basis.&#xD;
WMU training consists of computerised working memory updating tasks in which trial accuracy and response time are recorded. Two tasks will be trained: 1. a visuo-spatial Matrix Updating (MU) and 2. a verbal Keep Track (KT). For both training tasks, level of difficulty can be modulated by increasing or decreasing the update level, i.e., the number of updates on each trial.</description>
