  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to investigate whether a cold application to the contralateral&#xD;
      (affected side) extremity in addition to unilateral neuromuscular electrical stimulation&#xD;
      (NMES) application has a facilitating effect on muscle strength in post-stroke hemiplegia&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this prospective randomized controlled single-blind study, a total of 25 patients, 16 men,&#xD;
      and 9 women were included according to inclusion and exclusion criteria. Patients were&#xD;
      randomly assigned to the experimental group (n=12) or the control group (n=13). NMES has&#xD;
      applied to the non-affected side ankle dorsiflexors five sessions for a week in both groups.&#xD;
      In addition to the experimental group, the cold application was applied on the affected side&#xD;
      dorsiflexor muscle skin. The cold application was done on a moist towel for five minutes&#xD;
      using a cold pack. A five-minute break was given and a further 5-minute cold application was&#xD;
      repeated. The cold application was done simultaneously with NMES. A conventional&#xD;
      rehabilitation program was applied to all patients by a physiotherapist. Before and after&#xD;
      treatment, both ankle dorsiflexor strength was measured with a force sensor. For force&#xD;
      measurements, a force transducer (FC2211-0000-0100-L Compression Load Cell, TE Connectivity&#xD;
      company, France) was used. Force transducer signals were received with a data acquisition&#xD;
      device (POWERLAB® data acquisition system ADInstruments, Oxford, UK) and evaluated offline on&#xD;
      the computer. The measurement values were expressed in kilogram.force (kg.f) and this value&#xD;
      was normalized according to body weight.&#xD;

    <measure>Change of Lower Extremity Brunnstrom Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline Lower Extremity Brunnstrom Score at 6 days</time_frame>
    <description>This test describes the sequences of motor recovery after stroke based on the muscle tone, synergy patterns and isolated movements. Brunnstrom classified stages of recovery into six stages. Stage 1 and 6. Stage 1:Flaccidity; Stage 6: Spasticity disappears and individual joint movements become possible</description>

    <time_frame>Change from Baseline Modified Ashworth Scale Score at 6 days</time_frame>
    <description>The modified Ashworth scale is the tool used to measure the increase of muscle tone. The modified Ashworth scale is score is graded between 0 and 4. 0: No increase in muscle tone, 4: Affected part(s) rigid in flexion or extension</description>

    <measure>Change of Functional Ambulation Scale Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline Functional Ambulation Scale Score at 6 days</time_frame>
    <description>The Functional Ambulation Classification (FAC) is a functional walking test that evaluates ambulation ability. Patients are categorized between 0 (non-functional ambulation) and 6 (independent).</description>
