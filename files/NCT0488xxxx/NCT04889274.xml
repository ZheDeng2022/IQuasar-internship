  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Inorganic nitrate can protect blood vessels from the damage that occurs during cardiovascular&#xD;
      disease. Early experimental work suggests that nitrate-induced improvements in vascular&#xD;
      function relate to the suppression of inflammatory pathways. Whether this protection against&#xD;
      inflammation-induced damage to the blood vessel wall might also be functional in the setting&#xD;
      of COVID-19 vaccination will be investigated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Vascular function will be assessed before and after the healthy participant has received&#xD;
      their COVID-19-vaccination. Whether there might be differences in the response to the vaccine&#xD;
      between the sexes and whether a dietary nitrate intervention impacts upon the effects of&#xD;
      vaccination will be investigated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is in two parts:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part A: To assess sex differences in the vascular response to COVID-19 vaccination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part B: To assess whether inorganic nitrate, in the form of dietary inorganic nitrate&#xD;
      supplementation compared to placebo control, can raise circulating plasma nitrite levels and&#xD;
      thereby prevent the systemic inflammation that causes vascular dysfunction.&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Whether the COVID-19 vaccine can be used to study endothelial dysfunction and whether&#xD;
      inorganic nitrate might be useful in restoring the function of the endothelium in a scenario&#xD;
      simulating the COVID-19 infection setting will be investigated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Furthermore, sex differences in the vascular response to the COVID-19 vaccination will be&#xD;
      investigated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: A prospective randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Target population: A total of 98 healthy participants will be recruited. Part A: 30&#xD;
      participants (15 male, 15 female.) Part B: 68 participants (34 intervention, 34 placebo).&#xD;
      Participants will be recruited prior to receiving the COVID-19 vaccination, via Barts Health&#xD;
      NHS Trust approved vaccination hubs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Setting: Equal numbers of healthy male and female volunteers, aged between 18 and 60 years of&#xD;
      age, will be recruited. Following recruitment, participants will undergo baseline&#xD;
      measurements of vascular function of flow mediated dilatation (FMD) and pulse wave&#xD;
      analysis/velocity (PWA, PWV), in addition to haematological and clinical biochemical&#xD;
      analyses. Volunteers will then be randomised into one of the 2 study Parts (Part A: sex&#xD;
      differences in vascular response to COVID-19 vaccine, Part B: influence of dietary nitrate&#xD;
      upon vascular responses to COVID-19 vaccine). If randomised to Part B, volunteers will be&#xD;
      treated with 3 days of either 4-5mmol nitrate-containing beetroot juice or placebo. If&#xD;
      randomised to Part A, the volunteers will not receive an intervention. On day 3, all&#xD;
      participants will receive their COVID-19 vaccine. At 8Â±2hours after the vaccine, the&#xD;
      participants will undergo repeat measurements of vascular function. A quality of life&#xD;
      questionnaire will be obtained 28 days after the vaccine has been administered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention: All volunteers will receive COVID-19 vaccination in Part A and Part B. In Part&#xD;
      B of the study, volunteers will be randomised in a 1:1 fashion to receive either&#xD;
      nitrate-containing beetroot juice (4-5mmol nitrate) or nitrate-deplete placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will take place in the Clinical Research Centre at The William Harvey Research&#xD;
      Institute.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis: For the analysis of Part A linear regression will be used to compare change in&#xD;
      vascular dysfunction from pre- to post-vaccination between the sexes, unadjusted and adjusted&#xD;
      for important risk factors including age, BMI and baseline vessel diameter. For Part B&#xD;
      analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) will be used to compare change in vascular dysfunction from&#xD;
      pre- to post-vaccination between dietary nitrate and placebo control groups adjusting for&#xD;
      pre-vaccination level, and to compare change in plasma nitrite between dietary nitrate and&#xD;
      placebo control groups adjusting for baseline nitrite level.&#xD;
