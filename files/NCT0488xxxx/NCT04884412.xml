  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the sub-thalamic nucleus (STN) has evolved over the past&#xD;
      decades as a mainstream therapy for advanced Parkinson's disease (PD). The classical&#xD;
      procedure consists in STN indirect targeting based on stereotactic atlases or statistical&#xD;
      coordinates in AC-PC (Anterior Commissure - Posterior Commissure) referential along with&#xD;
      target control and correction by micro-electrode recordings (MER) and awake clinical testing.&#xD;
      To avoid potential complications and patient discomfort related to current procedure, asleep&#xD;
      surgery without this control process has become more and more performed, essentially thanks&#xD;
      to the progress of neuroimaging allowing to STN visualization. However, it has been reported&#xD;
      a relative inaccuracy between the &quot;radiological&quot; STN delimitated on several types of MRI&#xD;
      sequences (T2, T2*, SWI) and the per-operative electrophysiological findings. As a result,&#xD;
      there are currently many types of STN-DBS procedures, and the lack of standardization between&#xD;
      techniques complicates the interpretation of postoperative results on anatomical,&#xD;
      electrophysiological and clinical points of view. Furthermore, to date, it has not been&#xD;
      proven that asleep surgery without MER and clinical controls is as effective as the standard&#xD;
      procedure in a prospective controlled randomized clinical trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators hypothesize that the clinical-based 18 landmarks STN target will be precise&#xD;
      enough to allow to perform surgery under general anesthesia without MER correction, and&#xD;
      accurate enough to achieve non inferior clinical results compared to what is usually done in&#xD;
      each centre.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective is to compare at one year, the % of motor improvement after PARKEO&#xD;
      2-targeting asleep DBS without intraoperative MER versus the targeting procedure using&#xD;
      intraoperative MER by the UPRDRS 3 (Unified Parkinson's disease rating scale 3).&#xD;
