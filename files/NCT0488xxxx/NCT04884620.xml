  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The COPENHAGEN School Study is a combined cross-sectional and longitudinal study of healthy&#xD;
      Danish school children. This study will by clinical examinations and withdrawal of blood&#xD;
      samples investigate whether age of pubertal onset is continuing to decline in Denmark over&#xD;
      the past 15 years. Furthermore, we will investigate the mechanism driving earlier onset of&#xD;
      puberty and the long term health risks of extremely early puberty using Danish registry data&#xD;

      Cross-sectional School study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All children will be examined once and the following data will be collected:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Clinical medical examination of the child consisting of height measurements (standing-&#xD;
           and sitting-height), arm-span, weight, fat fold measurements (biceps, triceps, flank,&#xD;
           subscapularis), circumference of waist and hip, waist-hip ratio, blood pressure, body&#xD;
           fat composition. Puberty development will be assessed by trained and experienced&#xD;
           clinical personal according to Tanner criteria. Girls will be investigated for&#xD;
           assessment of breast development stage B1-5 (by palpation), pubic hair staging PH1-5,&#xD;
           occurrence of axillary hair (Stage 0-2), menarche (yes / no), sweat (yes/no) and acne&#xD;
           (yes/no), and boys, their genitalia development stage G1-5, pubic hair stage PH1-6,&#xD;
           occurrence of axillary hair (yes/no), acne (yes/no), sweat (yes/no) and voice break&#xD;
           (yes/no). The testicular volume assessed by means of Praders orchidometer.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Blood sample (35 ml) for measurement of: a) Hormone levels, peptides and growth factors&#xD;
           (FSH, LH, estradiol (total/free), progesterone, estrone/estrone sulphate, SHBG,&#xD;
           testosterone (total/free), DHEAS, 17-hydroxyprogestrerone, androstenedione, 11-dinhibin&#xD;
           B, AMH, INSL3 (only boys), kisspeptin, ghrelin, leptin, IGF-1, IGFBP-3, IGF-related&#xD;
           peptides, eoxycortisol, cortisol, cortisone, RANKL, OPG, fibroblast growth factor 23&#xD;
           (FGF23), TSH, T4, free T4, T3, free T3, HbA1C, calcium ion, alkaline phosphatase, PTH,&#xD;
           magnesium, phosphate, 25-OH-vitamin D, osteocalcin, prolactin, insulin and lipids (HDL,&#xD;
           LDL, TG, Ip(a), cholesterol and lipoproteins), blood metabolites (e.g. amino acids,&#xD;
           biogenic amines, acylcarnitines, lyso-phosphatidylcholines, phosphatidylcholines,&#xD;
           sphingomyelins and hexose) and proteins (e.g. cytokines, growth factors, kinases, plasma&#xD;
           receptors, proteases, protease inhibitors, plasma hormones and structural proteins)); b)&#xD;
           Endocrine disrupters (PCBs, dioxins, parabens and phtalates); and c) DNA and RNA&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Morning urine sample (100 ml) for measurement of FSH, LH, testosterone, epitestosterone,&#xD;
           androsterone,etiocolanolone and endocrine disrupters (PCBs, parabens, pthalates,&#xD;
           bisphenol A, UV-filters and triclosan)&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Self-administered electronic questionnaire collecting information on previous growth,&#xD;
           illness, living conditions, lifestyle factors, parents' puberty history and current&#xD;
           hight and weight.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Biobank Blood and urine samples will be temporary stored during the data collection period&#xD;
      until 30th of Jule 2025. After this date, all unused serum, urine and DNA/RNA not used in the&#xD;
      planned analyses will be stored at the established permanent (RegionH, Fælles&#xD;
      Fryserfaciliteter) biobank (BIOSEK). The period of storage here is 30 years from the date&#xD;
      that the temporary storage is closed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prospective Registry-based Cohort study of the Long-term health and death risk after&#xD;
      extremely early puberty:&#xD;
&#xD;
      With a follow-up design, we will assess risk of morbidity and mortality amongst cases and&#xD;
      referent children. Hazard rations (HRs) will be calculated using Cox regression analyses with&#xD;
      stratification using each case and his/her matched referent subjects as a stratum. This&#xD;
      ensures that comparisons are adjusted for age and calendar time. Co-variates includes&#xD;
      maternal (BMI, smoking, socioeconomic status) during the index pregnancy, also birth weight,&#xD;
      length and head circumference of participants. All will be identified in national registries&#xD;
      for all persons.&#xD;

      DNA and RNA will be isolated and amplified from collected blood samples and stored. Only&#xD;
      specific primers targeted at known SNPs in genes with established or theoretic effects on&#xD;
      hormone production, modification or receptor sensitivity or SNP arrays covering common&#xD;
      variants (≥1% minor allele frequency, based on allele frequency of the population reference&#xD;
      in the current standard, e.g. &quot;The Haplotype Reference Consortium&quot;) will be used for genetic&#xD;
      analysis. Genetic analysis will not include extensive mapping of the human genome. SNP array&#xD;
      data are important at the group level for scientific purposes, but not valid for making&#xD;
      clinical judgments on the individual level on the health of the participants. We will not&#xD;
      determine any genetic diseases. The participants will not be informed of the results of their&#xD;
      individual genetic makeup, only group level information will be available.&#xD;
