  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The inequity in cessation resources is at forefront in the recently enacted nationwide&#xD;
      smoking ban in public housing facilities. The critical component lacking from the federal&#xD;
      decree was a practical smoking cessation strategy to address the real-world needs of active&#xD;
      smokers who maintain cigarette usage. The investigator's proposal is ideally situated for&#xD;
      this contemporary moment when low-income smokers in public housing are signing leases&#xD;
      describing the potential for smoking-related evictions and thus at least contemplating&#xD;
      smoking modification. The investigator's project is centered around the residents of&#xD;
      Baltimore City Public Housing which is among the larger-sized U.S. public housing agencies.&#xD;
      Using a human-centered design (HCD) approach, the investigators are refining and testing a&#xD;
      community-centric cessation strategy defined by two core elements: a) durable and jointly&#xD;
      linked community/hospital infrastructure systems (remote cessation specialist staffing and&#xD;
      drug supplies) and strong on-site (public housing) residential leadership commitment to&#xD;
      cessation improvement. These dual features, along with adaptable elements that can be&#xD;
      modified to a variety of local/national housing settings, defines how the investigator's&#xD;
      project will overcome the implementation gaps defining failed smoking cessation efforts in&#xD;
      lower-income settings. The objective of this project is to test the feasibility of the&#xD;
      intervention package among local housing contextual factors that could impact both the&#xD;
      acceptability and adoptability of the investigator's project. Using a collection of formative&#xD;
      and implementation evaluation measures, the investigator's academic-community partnership&#xD;
      project is well positioned to create an adaptable and customizable intervention that can be&#xD;
      scaled in similar housing populations.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Lower socioeconomic populations continue to remain at high risk for tobacco use and suffer&#xD;
      disproportionately from tobacco-related disease. Evidence is lacking of ways to optimally&#xD;
      deliver behavioral and pharmaceutical-based cigarette smoking cessation interventions in&#xD;
      real-world environments among disadvantaged cohorts where geographic, socioeconomic and&#xD;
      technological disparities often undermine the effectiveness of evidence-based smoking&#xD;
      cessation efforts. The investigator's study focuses on residents of public housing in&#xD;
      Baltimore City, a population who face multiple socioeconomic stressors and of whom up to 1/3&#xD;
      are assumed conventional cigarette users.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigator's project uses a partnership between the Housing Authority of Baltimore City&#xD;
      (HABC) and Johns Hopkins School of Medicine to enact a remote (off-site) cessation program in&#xD;
      two public housing complexes under the management of HABC. The investigator's program will&#xD;
      institute evidence-based practices in an accessible manner for the residents at both sites.&#xD;
      The investigator's program's key features include the remote recruitment, prescription,&#xD;
      delivery and management of evidence-based nicotine pharmacotherapies, and provision of&#xD;
      cessation counseling.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To assess the feasibility of study design, the investigator's project specifically focuses on&#xD;
      the following eight elements: a) recruitment of smokers expressing a motivation to reduce or&#xD;
      quit smoking, b) Consent process, c) nicotine and non-nicotine pharmacotherapy selection,&#xD;
      screening, prescription, delivery, storage management (participation education,&#xD;
      side-effecting monitoring), and return of unused drug supplies, d) Administration and&#xD;
      perceived utility of motivational interviewing regarding smoking reduction and cessation, e)&#xD;
      Delivery of study reimbursement, f) Utility of weekly text reminders of study participation&#xD;
      and final endpoint, g) acceptability of outcome measures, h) acceptability and evaluation of&#xD;
      joint project oversight with community stakeholders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The project will enroll eighty participants to determine feasibility endpoints. All&#xD;
      participants will receive the intervention, as preferred by community partners. Participants&#xD;
      will serve as their own control, which in turn means that the investigators will compare the&#xD;
      intervention's effect at an individual level. All participants will be offered over a 4-week&#xD;
      period both a long-acting nicotine controller medication (varenicline or nicotine patch) and&#xD;
      short-acting medication to address acute urges to smoke (nicotine gum/lozenge). Each week&#xD;
      participants will be monitored and receive cessation-directed counseling. If medication&#xD;
      questions or concerns arise, patients will have access to 24-hour phone support. The results&#xD;
      of the project will be reviewed with participants, community partners and academic team.&#xD;

    <description>This outcome measures assesses cravings or withdrawal that occurs upon brief cessation of smoking, smoking temptations, compulsive use, and tolerance.&#xD;
The scores range from 8 - 40. The lower end of the range indicates no nicotine dependence and the upper end of the range correlates with a high degree of dependence.</description>

    <description>This outcome measure assesses perceptions of improved cognitive abilities, positive affective states, and pleasurable sensorimotor sensations due to smoking.&#xD;
The scores range from 6 - 30. A score of 6 indicates smoking cigarettes are not perceived at all as being associated with negative health experiences, including changes in cognition, affect and sensorimotor sensations; a score of 30 translates to a perception that cognition, affect and sensorimotor sensations are very much associated with smoking.</description>

The scores range from 6 - 30. A score of 6 indicates smoking cigarettes are not perceived at all as being associated with social disapproval and disappointment in oneself; a score of 30 translates to a perception that smoking is very much associated with social disapproval and disappointment in oneself</description>
