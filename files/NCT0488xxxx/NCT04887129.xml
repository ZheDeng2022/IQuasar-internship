  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to understand how to prevent COVID-19 spread in a school like&#xD;
      the Mary Cariola Center (MCC) in Rochester, NY by answering questions like these: how do&#xD;
      activities in the school alter chances of infection? Are there people infected with the&#xD;
      COVID-19 virus who have no symptoms? How is spread of COVID-19 affected by vaccination rates?&#xD;
      Is there any hesitancy to get the vaccine and what are the reasons? This information will be&#xD;
      used to help keep the school open and the students and staff safe.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible participants are those that work at the Mary Cariola Center (MCC) and interact with&#xD;
      the students at MCC who have a high risk of infection from COVID-19.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study lasts for up to 16 months.&#xD;

    <description>Participating individuals (students and employees) will be tested for COVID-19 (RT-PCR) using a specimen collected using a mid-turbinate swab.&#xD;
This asymptomatic testing regime starts on or after (if scheduling testing requires this to begin on a different day) enrollment and is repeated every 5-14 days for up to 16 months . Anyone testing positive is followed up as described below for symptomatic individuals.&#xD;
Those presenting with symptoms will be also tested for COVID-19 (RT-PCR). Those with negative test results will return to the asymptomatic testing protocol.&#xD;
Students who test positive are retested then 3 days until two negative tests. Employees who test positive also be tested every 3 days until two negative tests.</description>
