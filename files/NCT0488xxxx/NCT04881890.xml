  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators will conduct a single-arm mixed methods pilot study to examine the&#xD;
      feasibility and acceptability of a low-carbohydrate diabetes prevention program (LC-DPP). The&#xD;
      investigators will estimate weight loss as well as the percentage of participants who achieve&#xD;
      5% body weight loss at 6 month and 12 month timepoints. Weight loss from the pilot VA LC-DPP&#xD;
      cohort will be compared to weight loss outcomes from previously published DPP studies and the&#xD;
      VA MOVE! program. The investigators will also evaluate secondary outcomes including change in&#xD;
      physical activity, mental health, psychosocial functioning, and hemoglobin A1c over the&#xD;
      12-month study period. The investigators will also conduct qualitative interviews with&#xD;
      participants at 6 and 12 months.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The Veteran population faces high rates of T2DM with estimates surpassing 20% compared to 14%&#xD;
      among the general population. Furthermore, an estimated 25% of overweight or obese Veterans&#xD;
      have prediabetes and many will progress to T2DM over time. Fortunately, T2DM can be prevented&#xD;
      or delayed through dietary and physical activity changes that promote weight loss of ≥5% body&#xD;
      weight. To help Veterans lose weight and avoid obesity-related chronic conditions such as&#xD;
      T2DM, the VA Health System offers a lifestyle change program, VA MOVE!. Although MOVE! is&#xD;
      widely adopted across the VA Health System, weight loss outcomes are modest (range of&#xD;
      0.13-3.3 kg loss over one year) and less than 20% of participants achieve ≥5% weight loss.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Novel strategies are needed to help more Veterans to lose weight and prevent and manage&#xD;
      obesity-related conditions. One promising approach may be through a low-carbohydrate dietary&#xD;
      intervention. Consistent with historic United States Dietary Guidelines, diabetes prevention&#xD;
      clinical trials and their translational group-based programs, including VA MOVE!, recommend a&#xD;
      low-fat, calorie-restricted diet. However, the scientific merit of this recommendation has&#xD;
      been criticized. Growing evidence supports the efficacy of low-carbohydrate diets (defined&#xD;
      &lt;26% total energy from carbohydrate per day) and VLCDs (defined as &lt;10% of total energy from&#xD;
      carbohydrate per day) for short-term weight loss, long-term weight maintenance, and improved&#xD;
      glycemic control, particularly among individuals with T2DM and insulin resistance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objectives of this single-arm mixed methods pilot study are (1) to test the feasibility&#xD;
      and acceptability of a low-carbohydrate Diabetes Prevention Program (LC-DPP) among Veterans&#xD;
      with prediabetes and (2) to estimate weight loss among LC-DPP participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will recruit approximately 22 patients with body mass index ≥ 25 kg/m2 and&#xD;
      prediabetes (defined as hemoglobin A1c [A1c] 5.7-6.4%). Participants will be identified by&#xD;
      chart review and invited to participate by postal letter. Individuals that do not opt-out of&#xD;
      study contact will be screened for eligibility by telephone call. Interested and eligible&#xD;
      participants will be invited to attend an in-person information session. During this session,&#xD;
      they will receive information about the dietary intervention; written informed consent will&#xD;
      be obtained at this time. Study participants will attend a total of 24 group-based classes&#xD;
      over the course of 1-year. Body weight will be measured at each session. At 0, 6, and&#xD;
      12-months, the investigators will measure hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) and cholesterol levels as&#xD;
      well as self-reported measures of quality of life, mood, hunger, cravings, and physical&#xD;
      symptoms. Primary outcomes will be feasibility (e.g., enrollment, retention) and&#xD;
      acceptability (e.g., session attendance, qualitative feedback). Secondary outcomes will&#xD;
      change in weight, achievement of ≥5% body weight loss, change in HbA1c, and change in&#xD;
      cholesterol levels. During semi-structured interviewed conducted at 6-months and 12-months,&#xD;
      the investigators will explore participants' experiences with the program, barriers to and&#xD;
      facilitators of adherence to a low-carbohydrate diet, and perspectives on ways to improve the&#xD;
      intervention.&#xD;

    <description>LC-DPP participants will be instructed to follow ad-libitum very low-carbohydrate, ketogenic diet, which restricts carbohydrate intake (not including fiber) to 20-35 grams per day with the goal of achieving nutritional ketosis. Participants will be encouraged to eat a normal amount of protein (roughly 80-120 grams per day) and to derive the remaining calories from fat. Allowable foods include: meats, fish, poultry, eggs, cheese, seeds, nuts, leafy greens, non-starchy vegetables, and some fruits</description>
