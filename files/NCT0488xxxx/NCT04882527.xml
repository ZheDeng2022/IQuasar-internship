  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Prospective memory is the ability to remember to carry out intentions with a certain delay&#xD;
      (e.g. remember to buy stamps when passing a postal office). Prospective memory tasks require&#xD;
      a large degree of self-initiated retrieval and in the absence of a prompt to recall, people&#xD;
      must 'remember to remember' by their own volition. Thus, prospective memory is a challenge -&#xD;
      especially in old age with increasing health-related prospective memory demands.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Previous studies reported links between neural activity in specific brain regions and&#xD;
      prospective memory performance. Yet, the mere occurrence of a change in brain activity in&#xD;
      concomitance with performance of a behavioral task is not sufficient to confirm a causal&#xD;
      relationship between the two phenomena. Therefore, this study aims to apply non-invasive&#xD;
      brain stimulation to facilitate or inhibit activity in different brain regions presumed to be&#xD;
      functionally associated with prospective memory. Additional to the prospective memory tasks,&#xD;
      the investigators will implement control tasks (i.e., attention) to assess whether&#xD;
      stimulation will specifically enhance prospective memory performance or whether other&#xD;
      cognitive functions will be modulated additionally.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is hypothesized that stimulation will lead to changes in prospective memory functioning.&#xD;
      Further, the investigators expect that facilitation of attentional processes might be linked&#xD;
      to prospective memory improvements.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to modulate neural activity in the left and right inferior frontal lobe as&#xD;
      well as in the right superior parietal lobe via high-definition transcranial direct current&#xD;
      stimulation (HD-tDCS) in older adults. There is evidence from functional magnetic resonance&#xD;
      imaging (fMRI) studies that these areas are involved in prospective memory performance in&#xD;
      younger and older adults but a causal relation between activity in these areas and responses&#xD;
      in prospective memory tasks has not been established so far.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A double blind, sham-controlled, parallel group design will be applied. Healthy older adults&#xD;
      (n=105) will participate in two separate sessions: During the first baseline session, no&#xD;
      stimulation is applied. For the second session, participants will then be randomly assigned&#xD;
      to one of seven experimental groups (cathodal vs. anodal right inferior frontal lobe (rIFL);&#xD;
      cathodal vs. anodal left inferior frontal lobe (lIFL); cathodal vs. anodal right superior&#xD;
      parietal lobe (rSPL); or sham). Real stimulation will be applied during 20 minutes with one&#xD;
      Milliamp (mA). In case of sham stimulation (i.e., control intervention), the electrode&#xD;
      positions and the attachment procedures correspond to those of real tDCS but the electrical&#xD;
      current will only be ramped up to one mA and switched off completely after 30 s of&#xD;
      stimulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of this study is the modulation of prospective memory performance in a&#xD;
      computer-based task via tDCS. Further, this study aims to clarify the role of attentional&#xD;
      control for prospective memory performance, as both processes seem to recruit similar neural&#xD;
      structures. Additionally, naturalistic and self-rated prospective memory performance will be&#xD;
      assessed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is hypothesized that stimulation of the right inferior frontal lobe will lead to changes&#xD;
      in prospective memory performance and attentional processes. Whether cathodal or anodal&#xD;
      stimulation will enhance performance is not clear yet, since previous fMRI studies were&#xD;
      inconsistent about activity changes in older adults. Further, the investigators expect that&#xD;
      anodal stimulation of the left inferior frontal cortex may lead to faster responses to&#xD;
      prospective memory stimuli, whereas cathodal stimulation of the same area may lead to&#xD;
      prolonged reaction times. It is hypothesized that attentional control will not be affected by&#xD;
      stimulation of the left inferior frontal lobe. Finally, the investigators expect that anodal&#xD;
      stimulation of the right superior parietal cortex will lead to better prospective memory and&#xD;
      attentional control performance, whereas cathodal stimulation will have detrimental effects&#xD;
      on both functions.&#xD;
