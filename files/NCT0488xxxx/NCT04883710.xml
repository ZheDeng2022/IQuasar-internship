      The aim of the WFH GTR is to provide a database in which long-term data on PWH who receive&#xD;
      gene therapy from around the world, will be collected and housed.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The first gene therapy product for hemophilia is expected to receive marketing authorization&#xD;
      in 2020, with several others following closely behind. With these new therapies hitting the&#xD;
      market in the near future, it is incumbent on us as a community to ensure that we have&#xD;
      measures in place to allow monitoring of expected, unexpected and unknown safety issues, as&#xD;
      well as duration of efficacy, over the long term. Low incidence adverse events require&#xD;
      monitoring of a large number of patients, over a long period of time, necessitating a global&#xD;
      initiative.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To fill this need, the World Federation of Hemophilia (WFH), under the guidance of a&#xD;
      multi-stakeholder steering committee, is developing and implementation the WFH Gene Therapy&#xD;
      Registry (GTR). The aim of the WFH GTR is to provide a database in which long-term data on&#xD;
      PWH who receive gene therapy from around the world, will be collected and housed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The WFH GTR steering committee is made up of hematologists, clinical trialists,&#xD;
      methodologists, epidemiologists, manufacturers and patient advocates. All stakeholders have a&#xD;
      role in ensuring the success of this important initiative.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The WFH GTR will collect a core set of demographic, safety and efficacy data, on all patients&#xD;
      with hemophilia, who receive a gene therapy product via a clinical trial or post-marketing,&#xD;
      from anywhere in the world. The core data set is currently in development; and the global&#xD;
      implementation plan is being finalized. A database provider will be selected in Q1 2020,&#xD;
      based on a request for proposals which was issued to several database providers. The database&#xD;
      for the WFH GTR will begin development in Q2 2020, with the aim of having a final database&#xD;
      ready for launch in by end of 2020, when the first gene therapy product is available to&#xD;
      patients. At this time, we will also begin recruitment of patients who have received gene&#xD;
      therapy through a clinical trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be recruited through hemophilia treatment centers (HTC) who provide gene&#xD;
      therapy to patients with hemophilia. Investigators will recruit patients into the WFH GTR and&#xD;
      enter baseline and follow up data over the long term. There is no determined end date for&#xD;
      this registry. For countries who have an existing national registry, we offer the possibility&#xD;
      of linking databases directly.&#xD;
