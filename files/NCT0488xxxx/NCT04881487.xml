      A randomized controlled trial, nested within an existing prospective cohort (Dutch Pancreatic&#xD;
      Cancer Project; PACAP) according to the 'trials within cohorts' (TwiCs) design in which the&#xD;
      effect of additional local ablative therapy compared to current standard of care alone, on&#xD;
      survival after recurrence in patients with isolated local pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma&#xD;
      (PDAC) recurrence. The most important secondary endpoint is quality of life. Other secondary&#xD;
      endpoints are treatment response, acute and late toxicity, overall survival, progression-free&#xD;
      survival, local progression-free survival, distant metastases free survival and reasons for&#xD;
      non-eligibility or exclusion.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Rationale: Disease recurrence remains the main cause of mortality in patients who underwent&#xD;
      resection for PDAC. In case of recurrence, patients are currently treated with palliative&#xD;
      chemotherapy or best supportive care. In 20-30% of all patients, isolated local PDAC&#xD;
      recurrence occurs after resection, which is frequently associated with considerable morbidity&#xD;
      from local destructive tumor growth. Although survival after recurrence is predominantly&#xD;
      determined by systemic disease, additional local ablative therapy might be of value to&#xD;
      improve local disease control in these patients, which could positively affect survival and&#xD;
      quality of life (QoL). Previously, radiation therapy has played only a minor role in the&#xD;
      treatment of PDAC. As the pancreas is tightly surrounded by organs with limited radiation&#xD;
      dose tolerance and subjected to abdominal motion due to respiration and peristalsis, optimal&#xD;
      dose delivery has been impeded with conventional radiotherapy techniques. The development of&#xD;
      image-guided stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) techniques, however, enabled safe&#xD;
      delivery of high irradiation doses to pancreatic lesions. Early retrospective studies have&#xD;
      suggested that SBRT might lead to improved local control in patients with isolated local PDAC&#xD;
      recurrence, potentially having a beneficial effect on both survival and QoL. In the current,&#xD;
      multicenter randomized controlled trial, the value of SBRT in addition to standard of care in&#xD;
      patients with isolated local PDAC recurrence is compared to standard of care alone, with&#xD;
      regard to both survival and quality of life outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: The main objective of this study is to improve survival after recurrence in&#xD;
      patients with isolated local PDAC recurrence using local ablative treatment with SBRT in&#xD;
      addition to standard of care. Furthermore, the effects of additional SBRT on QoL will be&#xD;
      evaluated within this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design: A randomized controlled trial, nested within a prospective cohort (PACAP)&#xD;
      according to the TwiCs design.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population: PACAP-participants with isolated local PDAC recurrence after primary&#xD;
      resection who provided informed consent for being randomized in future studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention: Local ablative therapy (5 times 8 Gray SBRT) in addition to standard of care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Comparison: standard of care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main study endpoints: The main study endpoint is survival after recurrence. The most&#xD;
      important secondary endpoint is quality of life. Other secondary endpoints are radiological&#xD;
      treatment response, acute and late toxicity, overall, progression-free, local&#xD;
      progression-free and distant metastasis free survival and reasons for non-eligibility or&#xD;
      exclusion.&#xD;
