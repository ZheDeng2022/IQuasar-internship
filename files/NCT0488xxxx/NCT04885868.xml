  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients will have an automated call supervised by a human clinician to check how they are&#xD;
      after uncomplicated cataract surgery as part of their standard of care. The study aims to&#xD;
      evaluate the acceptability of this system through a net promoter score and for a subsection&#xD;
      of patients using a qualitative interview.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will be a qualitative cohort design. The target will be to recruit 1000 patients&#xD;
      who meet the inclusion criteria and provide consent following the process set out below. This&#xD;
      represents recruiting 75% of the total projected number of patients who will undergo cataract&#xD;
      surgery during the trial period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently at Buckinghamshire Healthcare NHS Trust patients who have uncomplicated cataract&#xD;
      surgery are given post-op instructions and assessed for their suitability to undergo&#xD;
      telephone follow-up by the nursing team in the discharge lounge. If deemed suitable for a&#xD;
      telephone call (equivalent to the criteria for inclusion in this study, including the&#xD;
      capacity to consent) a date to expect a telephone follow-up call is given. During the study&#xD;
      these patients will also be given an information leaflet and information relating to the&#xD;
      study by the nursing team.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The post-op telephone call occurs three weeks later and at the start of this call patients&#xD;
      will be asked if they consent to take part as well as if they have any further questions. If&#xD;
      they agree to participate in the study their follow-up will be conducted by the autonomous&#xD;
      human supervised system as well as additional questions to determine the acceptability of the&#xD;
      system. If they decline to participate or are unable to consent (for example, the unlikely&#xD;
      event that their capacity has become impaired following surgery), they will have their&#xD;
      follow-up conducted by a human clinician as per the current standard of care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For those patients who provide consent the autonomous human supervised system comprises&#xD;
      several conversational elements which occur in order:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Greeting and introduction&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Identification of patient&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Cataract follow-up symptom questions&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Patient's queries and frequently asked questions&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Acceptability questions&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Closure of call&#xD;
&#xD;
      If all of the questions aren't asked by the autonomous system or the human supervisor feels&#xD;
      additional information is required they can ask these at the end of the call. The patient may&#xD;
      withdraw from the automated call at any point.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 50 patients (5% of total recruited) who consent to participate will be invited to take&#xD;
      part in a subsequent structured telephone interview with a researcher to explore in greater&#xD;
      depth their experience of using the system. The interview will last no more that 30 minutes&#xD;
      and will be conducted within one week of the follow-up call.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anonymised data from the patient ratings will undergo standard statistical analysis. The&#xD;
      qualitative responses to the reasons why they gave their score as well as the answers to the&#xD;
      in-depth interviews will undergo thematic analysis to understand patients' perceptions of&#xD;
      having the follow-up conducted by the autonomous human supervised system.&#xD;
