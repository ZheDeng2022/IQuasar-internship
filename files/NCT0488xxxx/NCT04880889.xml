      A study, phase III, randomized, single-center, to assess the non-inferiority of the BL3000,&#xD;
      when compared to Pantogar® in the treatment of telogen effluvium in women. 326 female&#xD;
      patients will be recruited for the study. They will be aged from 18 to 45 years old, not&#xD;
      menopausal, diagnosed with telogen effluvium proven by Trichoscan, who meet the inclusion&#xD;
      criteria and do not meet the exclusion criteria and who sign the Informed Consent Form.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be divided into two treatment groups according to randomization:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group I: 163 patients will receive treatment with the medication BL3000. Group II: 163&#xD;
      patients will receive treatment with the reference drug (Pantogar®).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients will participate in the study for a period of 199 (one hundred and ninety-nine)&#xD;
      days, using of the investigational or comparative product for 180 (one hundred and eighty)&#xD;
      days,&#xD;

    <description>Assess the non-inferiority of the effectiveness of the BL3000 drug compared to the drug.&#xD;
The counting of anagen and telogen performed by phototrichogram in the initial and final experimental times, with the calculation proposed according to the protocol below:&#xD;
The primary variable of efficacy will be the rate of anagen hairs (FA) (%), 45.90 and 180 days in relation to the beginning, between the two arms of treatment (test versus control). Calculated as follows:&#xD;
FA (vi): result of anagen (%) on visit 04 (T0); FA (vf): result of anagen (%) on visit 10 (T182). Response rate of anagen (%), FA = (FA (vf)-FA (vi)).</description>
