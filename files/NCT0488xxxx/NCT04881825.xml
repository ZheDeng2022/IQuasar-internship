  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This trial is an extension trial to EASE SBS 2. The study looks at whether glepaglutide is a&#xD;
      safe treatment for participants with Short Bowel Syndrome (SBS), as well as how well&#xD;
      effectiveness is maintained during long term treatment. Participants in this trial will&#xD;
      receive glepaglutide as once-weekly injections under the skin (subcutaneous, s.c.) for&#xD;
      approximately 2 years.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Informed consent obtained before any trial-related activity&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Completed the full treatment period of the extension trial EASE SBS 2 (ZP1848-17127)&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any condition, disease, or circumstance that in the Investigator's opinion would put&#xD;
             the patient at any undue risk, prevent completion of the trial, or confound the&#xD;
             planned assessments of the trial&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Not having a colonoscopy performed at End of Trial in EASE SBS 2 (for patients with&#xD;
             remnant colon). Note. The results of the colonoscopy must not give rise to any safety&#xD;
             concerns. A colonoscopy performed within 6 months prior to End of Trial and not giving&#xD;
             rise to any safety concerns is accepted. For patients with a remnant colon, which is&#xD;
             not connected to the passage of foods and is thereby dormant, a computerized&#xD;
             tomography (CT) scan or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) will suffice at the&#xD;
             discretion of the Investigator&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Use of GLP-1, GLP-2, human growth hormone (HGH), dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4)&#xD;
             inhibitors, somatostatin, or analogs thereof within 3 months. Note: Prior use of&#xD;
             glepaglutide trial drug is allowed&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Females of childbearing potential, who are pregnant, breast-feeding, intend to become&#xD;
             pregnant, or are not using highly effective contraceptive methods&#xD;
