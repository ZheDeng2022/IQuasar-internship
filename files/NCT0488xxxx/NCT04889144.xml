  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposed research has significant public health relevance and is consistent with the&#xD;
      broader goals of public health focuses on improving communication regarding end-of-life care.&#xD;
      The development of a Culturally Competent Communication Intervention designed to coach Latino&#xD;
      advanced cancer patients in how to communicate EOL goals of care in order to improve their&#xD;
      engagement in advance care planning will help reduce Latino/non-Latino disparities in advance&#xD;
      care planning and potentially end-of-life care. If the Culturally Competent Communication&#xD;
      Intervention proves to be potentially efficacious, there is a strong argument for testing&#xD;
      this intervention in a larger, multi-site study to test for effectiveness.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Compared to whites, Latinos are much less likely to engage in various forms of advance care&#xD;
      planning (ACP), including completing advance directives and having end-of-life (EOL)&#xD;
      discussions. ACP is critical to provision of quality EOL care, as it has been associated with&#xD;
      greater likelihood of patients' EOL wishes being followed. Latino advanced cancer patients&#xD;
      are also significantly more likely than their white counterparts to receive futile and&#xD;
      burdensome aggressive care at the end-of-life, to die in the ICU, and to have care that runs&#xD;
      counter to their preferences and values. Dr. Shen's pilot work, along with the current&#xD;
      literature, suggests that targeting ACP may help improve Latinos' EOL care. As such, the&#xD;
      proposed project will develop and pilot-test a culturally competent communication (CCC)&#xD;
      intervention. First, the CCC intervention will be developed based on results from a&#xD;
      questionnaire embedded into a current R01 (MPIs: Prigerson, Maciejewski) assessing Latinos'&#xD;
      cultural, familial, and religious beliefs as well as their knowledge, motivation (readiness),&#xD;
      and action to engage in ACP. Next, the developed CCC intervention will be vetted among Latino&#xD;
      stakeholders and field-tested among Latino advanced cancer patients to guide the finalization&#xD;
      of the intervention. Finally, a pilot randomized trial will examine the feasibility,&#xD;
      acceptability, and potential efficacy of the CCC intervention at improving engagement in ACP.&#xD;
      Results will provide timely insight into a potentially effective, low burden intervention&#xD;
      designed to improve Latinos' engagement in ACP.&#xD;

    <description>End-of-life care discussions will be measured by asking patients to self-report whether they have discussed any of the following: (1) wishes they have about the care they would like to receive if they were dying and/or (2) advance care directives, with an oncology provider or family member: DNR orders, living wills, durable powers of attorney for health care, assignments of health care proxies (yes/no format). Engagement will be measured as a count to the degree to which they engaged in each of these, with no=0 and yes=1. Total score can range from 0 (low or none) to 10 (high or discussed all domains with providers and family).</description>

Scores can range from 0 (low or none completed) to 4 (high or all completed).</description>

    <description>PLAN is a manualized three session intervention designed to improve engagement in advance care planning. It consists of five modules, covering the following for advance care planning: (1) checking awareness of core concepts; (2) clarifying misconceptions; (3) knowledge transferring; (4) goal setting; and (5) rehearsal or communication of advance care planning to loved ones and doctors. All sessions are delivered by a trained and licensed social worker. Patients also receive a 47-page manual to guide them through the intervention.</description>
