      Children 1-12 years presenting/admitted with acute diarrhea will be enrolled in the study&#xD;
      after taking informed consent from the parents. Patients will be randomly allocated to two&#xD;
      equal groups. Group A (GA) will receive anti secretory 1.5mg/kg/dose, three doses in 24 hours&#xD;
      along with oral rehydration, while Group B (GB) will receive a single dose of bovine&#xD;
      immunoglobulins. Response to treatment will be assessed by recording the frequency of loose&#xD;
      stools after 72 hrs. Data will be collected through a structured proforma.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      It is a randomized clinical trial that will be conducted at Children Hospital PIMS, Islamabad&#xD;
      over the period of 6 months. Sample size is calculated using World Health Organization (WHO)&#xD;
      calculator, keeping confidence level 95%, level of significance 5%, power of the test&#xD;
      80%,anticipated population proportion 1: 84%, anticipated population proportion 2: 93%, which&#xD;
      turn out to be 30.Consecutive non probability sampling technique will be used. Children 1-12&#xD;
      years both male and female visiting/admitted in Children Hospital PIMS with acute diarrhea of&#xD;
      less than 15 days duration will be enrolled in the study after taking informed consent from&#xD;
      the parents. Children requiring emergency resuscitation, having chronic diarrhea i-e more&#xD;
      than 15 days duration, having other comorbid conditions like heart, kidney and liver failure,&#xD;
      having metabolic disorder and who are allergic to egg or any of the contents will be excluded&#xD;
      from the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Child's name, age, sex will be recorded by the on duty doctor. Patients will be randomly&#xD;
      allocated to two equal groups. Group A (GA) will receive anti secretory 1.5mg/kg/dose three&#xD;
      doses per oral in 24 hours along with oral rehydration, while Group B (GB) will receive a&#xD;
      single dose of bovine colostrum and egg solids as 7 g of dry powder reconstituted in 30 mL of&#xD;
      water and taken orally once daily for 3 days along with oral rehydration. Response to&#xD;
      treatment will be assessed by recording the reduction in frequency of diarrheal episodes&#xD;
      after administration of drug and duration in which the diarrheal episodes were reduced. Data&#xD;
      will be collected through a structured proforma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All data will be analyzed using latest SPSS version. Quantitative variables such as age, time&#xD;
      will be presented as means and standard deviations. Qualitative variables such as age groups,&#xD;
      sex, recurrence of seizures and efficacy will be measured as frequency and percentages.&#xD;
      Effect modifiers like age, gender will be controlled by stratification. Post stratification&#xD;
      chi-square test will be applied keeping p value â‰¤0.05 as significant.&#xD;
