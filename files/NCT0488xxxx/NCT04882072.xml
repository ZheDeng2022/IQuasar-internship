        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Must have developed a relapse of Takayasu Arteritis (TAK) within 12 weeks prior to&#xD;
             administration of study intervention and the relapse must have occurred at a dose of&#xD;
             at least 7.5 milligrams (mg)/day (prednisolone or equivalent)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Must be receiving oral glucorticoid (GC) treatment of greater than or equal to (&gt;=)15&#xD;
             mg/day (prednisolone or equivalent), inclusive for the treatment of relapsing TAK and&#xD;
             be on a stable dose for at least 2 weeks prior to the first administration of study&#xD;
             intervention&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  If receiving an oral anti-platelet therapy (including but not limited to aspirin,&#xD;
             clopidogrel, ticlopidine) or anti-coagulation therapy (including but not limited to&#xD;
             warfarin) for treatment of TAK, the dose must have been stable for at least 2 weeks&#xD;
             prior to first administration of the study intervention. In terms of warfarin, the&#xD;
             dose should be controlled 1-5mg/day to maintain Prothrombin Time and International&#xD;
             Normalized Ratio (PT-INR) target range between 2.0-3.0 (if participants are over 70&#xD;
             years old, PT-INR target range should be between 1.6-2.6)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have no history of latent or active Tuberculosis (TB) prior to screening. An exception&#xD;
             is made for participants who have a history of latent TB and are currently receiving&#xD;
             treatment for latent TB, will initiate treatment for latent TB at least 3 weeks prior&#xD;
             to the first administration of the study intervention, or have documentation of having&#xD;
             completed appropriate treatment for latent TB within 3 years prior to the first&#xD;
             administration of the study intervention. It is the responsibility of the investigator&#xD;
             to verify the adequacy of previous antituberculous treatment and provide appropriate&#xD;
             documentation&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  If receiving an oral anti-hypertensive therapy for treatment of TAK, the dose must&#xD;
             have been stable for at least 2 weeks prior to first administration of the study&#xD;
             intervention&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has currently any known severe or uncontrolled TAK complications (example,&#xD;
             hypertension not responding to adequate treatment, aortic incompetence with cardiac&#xD;
             insufficiency, progressing aortic aneurysm, coronary artery lesions with severe&#xD;
             stenosis)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has received Methotrexate (MTX), Azathioprine (AZA), Mycophenolate Mofetil (MMF), oral&#xD;
             Triamcinolone (TAC), oral Cyclosporine A within 4 weeks of first study intervention&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has had a Bacille Calmette-guerin (BCG) vaccination within 12 months of screening&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any major illness/condition or evidence of an unstable clinical condition example,&#xD;
             history of liver or renal insufficiency (estimated creatinine clearance below 60&#xD;
             milliliters/minute [mL/min]); significant (cardiac, vascular, pulmonary,&#xD;
             gastrointestinal, endocrine, neurologic, hematologic, rheumatologic, psychiatric, or&#xD;
             metabolic disturbances), disease of any organ system or active acute or chronic&#xD;
             infection/infectious illness that, in the investigator's judgment, will substantially&#xD;
             increase the risk to the participant if he or she participates in the study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Having a condition that is steroid dependent (example, steroid dependent asthma,&#xD;
             chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, et cetera) that is not amenable to tapering&#xD;
             oral GC&#xD;
