      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Immersive virtual reality (VR) technology is used by researchers to measure how people&#xD;
      respond to complex stimuli in a controlled environment. Cognitive fatigue (CF) can result in&#xD;
      serious consequences such as mistakes and accidents. Researchers want to see if VR can be&#xD;
      used to learn more about CF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To test the user experience of a VR program designed to study individual differences in the&#xD;
      susceptibility to develop CF in healthy people while performing activities of daily living.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy adults ages 18-75 from the Washington Metropolitan area&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be screened with questions about their health and medical history.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The VR program simulates a real-world grocery shopping environment. Participants will be&#xD;
      given a shopping task.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be seated. They will wear a head-mounted display (HMD) for 1.5 hours. The&#xD;
      device is worn on the head. It presents images to the eyes. Eye-tracking data will be&#xD;
      collected through the HMD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following will happen in the VR environment:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be seated at a kitchen table. They will complete a pillbox task 2&#xD;
           times.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be placed in a small grocery store. They will be trained how to use&#xD;
           the controllers to shop.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will appear to be seated in front of a screen. They will be shown how to&#xD;
           answer questions about how tired they feel and if the tasks are hard to do.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be placed in a large grocery store. They will complete a shopping&#xD;
           task.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will complete surveys. They will also answer questions about the VR experience.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have 1 study visit. It will last 3-4 hours.&#xD;

      Objective: This study evaluates the utility of immersive virtual environments for objectively&#xD;
      studying individual differences in the susceptibility to develop cognitive fatigue in healthy&#xD;
      controls while performing instrumental activities of daily living (IADL) in two phases. Phase&#xD;
      1 aims to test functionality and user experience of the virtual reality (VR) experience; and&#xD;
      phase 2 aims to evaluate the level of fatigue experienced after participating in a VR&#xD;
      experience as measured by the Visual Analog Scale-Fatigue (VAS-F). The primary goal of the&#xD;
      protocol is the study of individual differences in subjective fatigability associated with&#xD;
      grocery shopping using immersive Virtual Reality as a research platform. The secondary&#xD;
      objective of the protocol is to identify objective measures of cognitive fatigue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Endpoint Phase 1: The phase 1 primary dependent measure is the total count of the&#xD;
      number of times, after completing the grocery shopping training exercise, the subject&#xD;
      required research staff to explain how to use the controller, how to move or inspect objects,&#xD;
      and/or how to move from one location to another location in the grocery store environment.&#xD;
      Secondary Endpoint for Phase 1: the ocular and general symptoms score from the virtual&#xD;
      reality symptom questionnaire (Ames et al., 2005); and the total score from the presence&#xD;
      questionnaire (Regenbrecht et al., 2002).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Primary Endpoint for Phase 2 primary:Total score of VAS-F (Lee et al., 1991).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Secondary Endpoint for Phase 2;Self-reported cognitive load score measured by the&#xD;
      NASA-TLX (Hart et al., 1988), eye-tracking data (e.g., percent eye-closure, fixation length,&#xD;
      blink rate) and task performance measures (e.g. shopping list total correct item selection&#xD;
      score, shopping list total incorrect item selection score, average item-selection time&#xD;
      score).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population: The study plans to enroll a total of 84 (24 in phase 1 and 60 in phase 2)&#xD;
      healthy participants from the Washington Metropolitan area between ages 18-75.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Key Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria: Both study phases utilize the same key inclusion/exclusion.&#xD;
      Participants must be between the ages (Bullet) 18 and 75 years. Key exclusion criteria&#xD;
      include: visual impairment in the form of limited or reduced 3D vision, oculomotor&#xD;
      disorder/dysfunction, susceptibility to visually-induced seizures, iritis, frequent&#xD;
      headaches/migraines, severe sensitivity to motion sickness and any impairment in the use of&#xD;
      arms/hands/fingers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: All participants will complete the study at the NIH main campus clinical center. This&#xD;
      is a two-phase research study. All participants will be screened for physical health,&#xD;
      cognitive and visual symptoms via self-report. Phase 1 combines a traditional user experience&#xD;
      design that utilizes qualitative, quantitative, and observational methods to test the&#xD;
      software functionality, user interface, and realism of the immersive experience and a&#xD;
      randomized control trial to estimate of effectiveness of the fatigue induction tasks. Phase 2&#xD;
      utilizes a 3-arm randomized control trial, where participants will be randomized into one of&#xD;
      three virtual shopping experiences, a control condition (exploration of the shopping&#xD;
      environment), a cognitively challenging condition (standard shopping list completion task),&#xD;
      or a cognitive and emotionally challenging condition (shopping list with interruptions,&#xD;
      interference, and rework). All participants will complete questionnaires and cognitive tests&#xD;
      pre-and-post VR environment. Questionnaires related to target processes (fatigue and&#xD;
      workload) are administered in the environment. After completing post-environment&#xD;
      questionnaires, the participants are provided an opportunity to give verbal feedback about&#xD;
      the experience and to note any observed problems with the interface or use of controllers, as&#xD;
      well as their VR experience.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Duration: Phase 1 is expected to be completed in a period of 8 months from opening of&#xD;
      enrollment to completion of data analysis. Phase 2 will require 12 months from opening of&#xD;
      enrolment until data analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participant Duration: Phase 1 is completed in one visit to the NIH campus, Phase 2 may be&#xD;
      completed in 1 or 2 visits to the NIH campus within the same week or consecutive weeks.&#xD;
