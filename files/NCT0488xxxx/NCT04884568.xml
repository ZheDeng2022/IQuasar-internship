    <textblock>
      A single-centre prospective, open, non-comparative, PMCF investigation to confirm performance&#xD;
      and safety of Exufiber® (gelling fibre dressing) when used as intended on donor sites. The&#xD;
      investigation will include eligible subjects undergoing split skin graft transplantation for&#xD;
      harvesting of a partial-thickness skin graft, i.e. excision of the epidermis and part of the&#xD;
      dermis. After the study inclusion (baseline) the patient will go through the split skin graft&#xD;
      transplantation following application of the Exufiber® dressing, Mepilex®(non-border)&#xD;
      dressing, and any third dressing as required on the donor site. Each subject will thereafter&#xD;
      be followed up on days 3, 14, and 21 prior completion in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A subject may complete the study prior to or on day 14 as well as in between day 14 and day&#xD;
      21 if the donor site is healed. Wound healing progression will be determined by the&#xD;
      investigator/designee and assessed as:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  100% re-epithelialisation including small residual scabs/blisters and open areas less&#xD;
           than 1 cm within an otherwise fully re-epithelialised area, and/or&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  less than 100% re-epithelialization but to the extent that the Exufiber dressing is not&#xD;
           required anymore&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the donor site is not healed and the donor site is dry and therefor not treatable with&#xD;
      Exufiber the patient will be treated according to clinical praxis and followed for outcomes&#xD;
      on the following visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Approximately 34 eligible subjects will be included in one centre in Sweden.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary performance endpoint will be progression of donor site wound from baseline to&#xD;
      last visit when Exufiber is used, up to 21 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Wound progression will be determined by the investigator/designee and will be assessed as one&#xD;
      of the following three outcomes:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Deteriorated&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  No change&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Improved&#xD;
