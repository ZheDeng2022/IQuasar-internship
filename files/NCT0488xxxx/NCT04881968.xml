  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hopewell Hospitalist is a theory-based adventure video game designed to increase the&#xD;
      likelihood that a physician will engage in an advance care planning (ACP) conversation with a&#xD;
      patient over the age of 65. Drawing on the theory of narrative engagement, players assume the&#xD;
      persona of a hospitalist physician and navigate a series of clinical encounters with&#xD;
      seriously-ill patients over the age of 65. Players experience the consequences of having (or&#xD;
      not having) ACP conversations in a timely fashion. The planned study is a crossover phase III&#xD;
      trial testing the effectiveness of providing physicians with a link to a free version of&#xD;
      Hopewell Hospitalist as a means for increasing ACP rates measured by ACP billing frequency.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Incidence of Billed Advance Care Planning</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months (3 months pre and 3 months post intervention)</time_frame>
    <description>Change in physician advance care planning billing for patients over the age of 65 in the three months before and after the roll-out of the video game intervention at their hospital. Advance care planning billing is defined as the presence/absence of ACP charges (Medicare billing codes 99497 or 99498) during a physician's patient's hospitalization.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Merit-based Incentive Payment System Advance Care Planning Quality Score</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months (3 months pre and 3 months post intervention)</time_frame>
    <description>Change in the Merit-based Incentive Payment System (MIPS) self-report measure of advance care planning by enrolled hospitalists (MiPS-ACP quality score). The MiPS-ACP quality score is the percentage of patients aged 65 years and older who have an advance care plan or surrogate decision maker documented in the medical record or documentation in the medical record that an advance care plan was discussed but the patient did not wish or was not able to name a surrogate decision maker or provide an advance care plan. The quality score ranges from 0-100%, with higher scores indicating that a greater proportion of patients with an advance care plan documented in the medical record.</description>

    <measure>Sum of Resources Utilized by Hospitalist-Managed Patients</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months (3 months pre and 3 months post intervention)</time_frame>
    <description>Combined sum of resources utilized by patients managed by enrolled hospitalists during their index hospitalization (first hospitalization in the relevant period: control or intervention). It is a composite measure including: admission to ICU, receipt of life-sustaining treatment(s) including mechanical ventilation, placement of tracheostomy, insertion of gastric feeding tube, new onset dialysis. This measure ranges from 0 to 5, where higher scores indicate greater utilization of resources during the index hospitalization.</description>
