  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies whether using exercise is better than the usual approach for&#xD;
      treating chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN). CIPN occurs when chemotherapy&#xD;
      damages the nerves communicating between the brain, spinal cord, and the rest of the body.&#xD;
      The usual approach for treating CIPN is treatment with drugs that help reduce symptoms of&#xD;
      other types of neuropathy (for example, from diabetes). However, these drugs do not treat all&#xD;
      symptoms of CIPN. Exercise may help to reduce CIPN symptoms.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Assess the preliminary efficacy of exercise versus (vs.) standard care for treating CIPN&#xD;
      (via patient-reported CIPN-20 total score).&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Assess the preliminary efficacy of exercise vs. standard care on individual symptoms of&#xD;
      CIPN (via CIPN Symptom Inventory; i.e., numbness, tingling, burning/shooting pain, and&#xD;
      cramping in the hands and feet).&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Assess the preliminary efficacy of exercise vs. standard care on a clinical test of CIPN&#xD;
      symptoms (via the tactile sensitivity in the fingers and toes).&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. Assess the effects of exercise vs. standard care on two possible CIPN mechanisms:&#xD;
&#xD;
      IIIa. Interoception (via Multidimensional Assessment of Interoceptive Awareness version 2&#xD;
      [MAIA-2] questionnaire).&#xD;
&#xD;
      IIIb. Inflammation (via serum cytokines IL6, IL-10, and IL-1beta, and prostaglandins&#xD;
      PGF2alpha and 6-Keto PGF1 alpha).&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Assess the effects of exercise vs. standard care on other common symptoms related to&#xD;
      cancer, chemotherapy, and CIPN, including:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ia. Daily Diary of symptoms of CIPN. Ib. An array of cancer and treatment symptoms (MD&#xD;
      Anderson Symptom Inventory; MDASI).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ic. Anxiety and depression (hospital anxiety and depression scale; HADS). Id. Pain&#xD;
      catastrophizing (pain catastrophizing scale; PCS). Ie. Cognitive impairment (Functional&#xD;
      Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Cognitive [FACT-Cog]).&#xD;
&#xD;
      If. Fatigue (brief fatigue inventory; BFI). Ig. Quality of life (Functional Assessment of&#xD;
      Cancer Therapy - General [FACT-G]), and coronavirus epidemic (coronavirus disease [COVID]&#xD;
      effects).&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM 1 (EXERCISE): Patients undergo the exercise for cancer patients (EXCAP) intervention&#xD;
      consisting of a home-based, self-directed, individually tailored progressive walking and&#xD;
      resistance program for up to 6 weeks. Patients also undergo a tactile sensitivity test at&#xD;
      baseline and after completion of EXCAP over 15-25 minutes. In addition, patients meet with a&#xD;
      certified exercise instructor over 45 minutes at baseline and 2 additional booster meetings&#xD;
      over 15-30 minutes during weeks 2 and 3 or weeks 4 and 5.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM 2 (CONTROL): Patients receive usual care for 6 weeks. At the end of the study, patients&#xD;
      may receive the exercise kit and complete the EXCAP program as in Arm 1. Patients also&#xD;
      undergo a tactile sensitivity test at baseline and after completion of EXCAP over 15-25&#xD;
      minutes.&#xD;
