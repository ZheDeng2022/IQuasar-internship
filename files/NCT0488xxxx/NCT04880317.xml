  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main aim is to validate non-gated 5-min computed tomography myocardial relative&#xD;
      enhancement (CT-MRE), which can be readily estimated via contrast-enhanced non-gated chest&#xD;
      CT, as a tool for estimating myocardial extracellular volume (ECV) using cardiac magnetic&#xD;
      resonance (CMR)-derived ECV as a reference standard in a consecutive series of patients&#xD;
      scheduled for cardiac CT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A secondary explorative aim is to evaluate the presence and extent of possible myocardial&#xD;
      alterations in those patients enrolled in the VALETUDO study who have been infected with&#xD;
      severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients scheduled to undergo contrast-enhanced cardiac CT and meeting inclusion criteria&#xD;
      will be proposed enrolment in the study, and as such they will be informed on the study aims&#xD;
      and design and will be invited to sign a specific informed consent. All potential enrollees&#xD;
      will be invited to undergo an additional CT acquisition as part of their cardiac CT&#xD;
      examination, to estimate CT-MRE, blood tests, and a contrast-enhanced CMR scan. All those&#xD;
      meeting exclusion criteria (contraindications to CMR, previous allergic reactions to&#xD;
      gadolinium-based contrast agents, pregnancy, severe obesity, claustrophobia) will be&#xD;
      consequently excluded from the study. Patients with a previous diagnosis of COVID-19 will not&#xD;
      be excluded if they are declared negative according to the procedure provided for by the&#xD;
      regulations in force.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For all those eventually included to participate in the study, the CT examination will&#xD;
      include the addition of a non-gated 5-min delayed acquisition, allowing the assessment of&#xD;
      CT-MRE. All enrolled patients will then undergo blood tests including the assessment of&#xD;
      haematocrit for the calculation of ECV and CT-MRE, and serological testing for COVID-19&#xD;
      antibodies. An additional blood sample (for a total of 30 ml of venous blood) will be tested&#xD;
      for myocardial fibrosis biomarkers (Troponin, Osteopontin, ST, and Osteocalcin), and the&#xD;
      remaining samples will be long-term bio-banked pending patients' approval.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All enrolled patients will then undergo a CMR examination within 10 days of the cardiac CT&#xD;
      scan, including the intravenous administration of a macrocyclic gadolinium-based contrast&#xD;
      agent, including cine sequences for myocardial function and strain assessment, and native-&#xD;
      and contrast-enhanced T1 mapping for myocardial ECV calculation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Myocardial CT-MRE and CMR-derived ECV calculation will be conducted according to methods&#xD;
      previously described by the two centres. All CT and CMR exams will be anonymized, and&#xD;
      segmentation for such purposes will be performed by readers with extensive experience in&#xD;
      cardiovascular CT and CMR. Additionally, myocardial strain will be calculated from CMR cine&#xD;
      sequences, through dedicated software.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Taking into consideration the known correlation between CT- and CMR-derived ECV and given the&#xD;
      correlation between CT-MRE and CT-derived ECV noted in a previous study from our group, we&#xD;
      would expect the coefficient of the correlation between CT-MRE and CMR-derived ECV not to be&#xD;
      lower than 0.3. On these grounds, aiming for an α error of 0.05 and a statistical power (1 -&#xD;
      β) of 0.90, we would require a sample size of 113 patients for our principal aim. Considering&#xD;
      a potential maximum dropout rate around 40% (mostly due to the refusal to undergo CMR on a&#xD;
      subsequent date from cardiac CT), we aim to enrol 188 patients for our study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Normality will be evaluated using Shapiro-Wilk test. In case of normal distribution, t-tests&#xD;
      will be used to assess differences between groups, and Pearson's r will be used for&#xD;
      correlations. In case of non-normal distributions, Mann-Whitney and Wilcoxon tests will be&#xD;
      used to assess differences, and Spearman's ρ for correlations. P-values ≤0.05 will be&#xD;
      considered as indicative of statistical significance.&#xD;

    <description>CT-MRE will be calculated as (1-hematocrit) multiplied by the ratio of the differences in image density between post- and pre-contrast images in the myocardium and blood pool. Thus, CT-MRE will be represented by a percentage value. It will be calculated by placing regions of interest on the appropriate CT images.</description>

    <measure>Assessment of correlations between CMR-derived myocardial strain, CMR-ECV and CT-MRE</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Myocardial strain will be calculated via feature tracking algorithms, segmenting the endocardium and epicardium on cine images. As strain represents the ratio between the difference in displacement of the myocardial wall and its original position, it will be represented by a percentage. Strain will be measured in its longitudinal, radial and circumferential components.</description>

    <measure>Role of ECV as a biomarker of chronic cardiac damage following SARS-CoV-2 infection</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>ECV will be calculated as the product between (1-hematocrit) and the ratio of the differences in image intensity between pre- and post-contrast T1 maps in the myocardium and blood pool. Data for this calculation will be derived by placing regions of interest in the appropriate MRI T1 maps. ECV is thus represented by a percentual value</description>
