  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Veterans with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) have an increased risk of developing&#xD;
      ischemic stroke. Veterans enduring PTSD face difficulties in managing their PTSD severity&#xD;
      after suffering from a stroke. Currently, clinical trials in PTSD exclude patients with&#xD;
      stroke and patients with significant premorbid psychological conditions like PTSD are usually&#xD;
      excluded from stroke clinical trials. Methylphenidate (MPH) is a central nervous system&#xD;
      stimulant that can improve PTSD symptoms: avoidance behaviors, social withdrawal,&#xD;
      hyperarousal, and working memory. MPH can also improve post-stroke outcomes: mood, activities&#xD;
      of daily living, and motor functioning. In clinical trials for PTSD or stroke, MPH has been&#xD;
      shown to be well-tolerated with minimal adverse events. The high prevalence of PTSD in&#xD;
      Veterans with stroke provides strong justification for development of interventions that&#xD;
      effectively and simultaneously target both conditions. The overarching goal of our proposal&#xD;
      is to understand how MPH improves PTSD severity in Veterans with comorbid stroke.&#xD;

      Veterans with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) have an increased risk of developing&#xD;
      ischemic stroke. Veterans enduring PTSD face difficulties in managing their PTSD severity&#xD;
      after suffering from a stroke. Currently, clinical trials in PTSD exclude patients with&#xD;
      stroke and patients with significant premorbid psychological conditions like PTSD are usually&#xD;
      excluded from stroke clinical trials. Methylphenidate (MPH) is a central nervous system&#xD;
      stimulant that blocks dopamine and norepinephrine transporters, selectively increasing&#xD;
      prefrontal cortex (PFC) activity. MPH can improve PTSD symptoms: avoidance behaviors, social&#xD;
      withdrawal, hyperarousal, and working memory. The suspected mechanism is MPH activates PFC,&#xD;
      enhancing fear extinction and improving PTSD symptoms. MPH can also improve post-stroke&#xD;
      outcomes: mood, activities of daily living, and motor functioning. In clinical trials for&#xD;
      PTSD or stroke, MPH has been shown to be well-tolerated with minimal adverse events. The high&#xD;
      prevalence of PTSD in Veterans with stroke provides strong justification for development of&#xD;
      interventions that effectively and simultaneously target both conditions. The overarching&#xD;
      goal of our proposal is to understand how MPH improves PTSD severity in Veterans with&#xD;
      comorbid stroke. The purpose of the clinical trial is to evaluate the therapeutic effects on&#xD;
      PTSD symptoms and post-stroke recovery of placebo-controlled MPH in Veterans diagnosed with&#xD;
      PTSD and cerebral stroke.&#xD;
