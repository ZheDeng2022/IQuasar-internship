    <textblock>
      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Environmental exposures like pollution, diet, and stress can help cause human diseases, or&#xD;
      make them worse. Researchers want to better understand how injury and inflammation are caused&#xD;
      by these exposures. They want to collect biological and environmental samples and other data.&#xD;
      They may use the samples to measure a range of factors, like hormones, toxins, and chemicals.&#xD;
      This will help them improve their studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To identify and understand how environmental exposures contribute to human disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy adults ages 18 and older&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be screened with questions about their health history, demographics, and&#xD;
      medicines they take.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants may give blood, hair, stool, saliva, and/or urine samples. They may have a skin&#xD;
      punch biopsy to collect skin cells. They may give fingernail or toenail clippings. They may&#xD;
      give a sample of exhaled breath.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants may give a sputum sample. They will inhale a saline mist and cough mucus into a&#xD;
      cup.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants may have their nasal passages brushed, scraped, or washed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants may give cheek cell samples. They will swish mouthwash and spit it into a cup.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants who produce sperm may give samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants may have bronchoscopy to collect fluid. A saline solution will be put into their&#xD;
      lung and then suctioned out, washing areas of the lung.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants may have a pelvic or transvaginal ultrasound. They may have lung function tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants may collect household dust, urine, or stool at home.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will complete surveys about their health, diet, and exposures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participation will last for one or more study visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants may be contacted in the future to take part in other studies.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Environmental exposures such as pollution, diet, stress, etc. contribute to the development&#xD;
      and exacerbation of human disease. Understanding the mechanisms of environmentally induced&#xD;
      injury and inflammation will allow us to devise better prophylaxis and treatment measures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects may undergo sampling of (including but not limited to:) blood, urine, saliva,&#xD;
      household dust, cheek cells, hair, nasal cells, stool, nail clippings, exhaled breath&#xD;
      condensate, sperm samples, skin cells, and/or sputum etc., and may answer predefined&#xD;
      questionnaires regarding health and exposures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Studies which may be performed on collected material includes establishment of cell cultures&#xD;
      and immunologic studies.&#xD;
