    <textblock>
      SHARC is an observational study of cartilage patients who are treated with surgery that&#xD;
      involves obtaining a harvest biopsy. SHARC will study the natural healing process of the&#xD;
      harvest biopsy site based on histological and biochemical analyses of repair tissue biopsies,&#xD;
      synovial fluid biomarkers, medical imaging (MRI) and gait analysis.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Osteoarthritis (OA) is a very common disease of the joints, for which in the United Kingdom&#xD;
      alone almost 9 million people have sought treatment. This painful disease affects the&#xD;
      cartilage and bone inside the joint. Many factors are known to increase the risk of getting&#xD;
      osteoarthritis, or the rate at which it gets worse. Very important among these factors is an&#xD;
      injury or a defect of the cartilage. It was believed for hundreds of years that cartilage,&#xD;
      once injured, does not heal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research from the past 10 years is now throwing doubt on this old certainty, as researchers&#xD;
      who took regular scans of volunteers over time noted that sometimes these defects come and&#xD;
      then go. A Japanese group of surgeons decided to look again after a year to see what had&#xD;
      happened to these defects, and noted that about half of them had got better! Cartilage&#xD;
      defects in human therefore can heal, but nobody knows how this works.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For many years, our Center has helped patients who have knee cartilage damage by using the&#xD;
      patients' own cartilage cells to help repair areas of damaged cartilage. This cell therapy&#xD;
      starts by taking a piece of cartilage (10 mm) from the patient's knee, and this created&#xD;
      defect always heals after a year. Thus, our proposal is to use our cell therapy patients as a&#xD;
      human experimental model of natural cartilage healing using a wide range of techniques&#xD;
      including Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), visual inspection of the joint itself during knee&#xD;
      joint surgery, examining biopsies of repair tissue down the microscope and measuring various&#xD;
      kinds of molecules researchers think are important. The information gathered from these tests&#xD;
      will help bridge the gap in our understanding of the mechanisms involved in the cartilage&#xD;
      tissue regeneration.&#xD;

DCE-MRI is a non-invasive imaging technique used to determine the state of inflammation in tissue and is routinely used to assess inflammation in patients with rheumatoid arthritis. The level of inflammation will be assessed as the percentage increase in signal intensity per second from the onset of signal increase until the maximum signal.</description>
