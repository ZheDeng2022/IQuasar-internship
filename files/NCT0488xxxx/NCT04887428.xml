  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main objective of this project is to assess the occupational insertion of these adult&#xD;
      patients with pediatric-onset IBD and to compare it with the general population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objectives are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. to assess the level of education and compare it to that of the general population&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. to assess occupational insertion and the educational level according to:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  The disease (Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis or unclassified colitis)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  sex&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Age at diagnosis (&lt;or â‰¥ 10 years)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  The occurence of surgery, the location of the disease, the treatments undertaken&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Quality of life&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Evaluate the patient's feelings about the impact of his illness on occupational&#xD;
           insertion and the educational level&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To describe the quality of life of patients in relation to disease activity and health&#xD;
           states (QALY calculation)&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. To assess the responsivness to change of the functional handicap score IBD-DI (n = 200&#xD;
           patients)&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Chronic inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) are responsible for high morbidity and impaired&#xD;
      quality of life of patients throughout disease course.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Numerous studies have shown the impact of the disease on the quality of life of patients with&#xD;
      IBD. However, very little data is available on the level of education and professional&#xD;
      integration of patients who started their IBD in childhood.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis behind the study project is that the level of education and consequently the&#xD;
      professional integration of patients with early pediatric IBD: 1) could be different from&#xD;
      those of the general population; 2) and that these differences could be influenced by the&#xD;
      nature of IBD, the age of its onset and its main characteristics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective of this project is to assess the professional integration of these adult&#xD;
      patients with pediatric-onset IBD and to compare it with the general population.&#xD;
