  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to collect information to evaluate the role of the psychogenic&#xD;
      component of pain induced by anxiety on postoperative outcomes in major orthopaedic surgery&#xD;
      and to determine whether hypnosis therapy provided during the perioperative period will lead&#xD;
      to decreased use of opioid therapy. Patients are randomly assigned to one of two treatment&#xD;
      groups: (I) usual care, or; (II) hypnotherapy treatment. Patients have an equal chance of&#xD;
      being assigned to one of the two groups.&#xD;

    <description>Patients will receive questionnaires to establish their attitudes/beliefs toward hypnosis, baseline pain, anxiety, &amp; shoulder function. 7 days before surgery, they will receive a pre-recorded video (~19 min) of guided hypnosis to be watched at least 1x/day, until surgery. Before &amp; after the video, they will rate pain/anxiety levels. On the day of surgery, they will watch the video again &amp; answer questions about their average anxiety and pain level. After surgery, they will watch the video each day and report on pain/anxiety, medication use, satisfaction, and sleep disturbance until postoperative day 7. Postoperative course will be otherwise completely standard of care, including a clinic visit at 10 days after surgery, where they will be given these same questionnaires. Patients will answer them again on postoperative day 49, constituting a study endpoint. Access to pain medication &amp; study doctor will be the same as any shoulder arthroplasty patient regardless of study participation.</description>

    <description>Patients will receive questionnaires to establish their attitudes/beliefs toward hypnosis, baseline pain, anxiety, &amp; shoulder function. 7 days before surgery, they will receive a daily questionnaire about their pain &amp; anxiety over the last 24 hours. On the day of surgery, before they are given any anesthesia, they will answer questions about their average anxiety &amp; pain levels. Starting the next morning on the day following surgery and every day for the subsequent week, they will be given questionnaires about their pain &amp; anxiety levels, medication use, satisfaction, and sleep disturbance due to pain. Their postoperative course will be otherwise completely standard of care, including a first postoperative clinic visit at 10 days after surgery, where the patients will be given these same questionnaires. Finally, patients will answer them one more time on postoperative day 49 and this will constitute a study endpoint. The whole process each day should take approximately 10 minutes.</description>
