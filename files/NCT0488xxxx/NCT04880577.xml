  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      As the in vivo reservoir of the Epstein-Barr virus, B cells play an important role in the&#xD;
      perpetuation of MS disease activity. B cell depletion therapy with medications like&#xD;
      ocrelizumab or rituximab have proved very successful in preventing clinical relapses and MRI&#xD;
      activity in MS, but incomplete in terms of neuroprotection and symptomatic outcomes.&#xD;
      Ocrelizumab and rituximab only target na√Øve and memory B cells expressing the CD20 marker but&#xD;
      do not deplete the wide spectrum of B cell lineages including plasmablasts and plasma cells,&#xD;
      which are also key reservoirs for EBV. This is particularly relevant to the mechanism of&#xD;
      action of TAF, since EBV lytic reactivation occurs in coordination with B-cell&#xD;
      differentiation. In vivo, the initiation of plasma cell differentiation provides the&#xD;
      physiological trigger for EBV lytic reactivation, and EBV utilizes the plasma cell&#xD;
      differentiation program to replicate. As these cells are ineffectively depleted by anti-CD20&#xD;
      treatment, the use of TAF would be highly complementary as an add-on treatment to anti-CD20&#xD;
      therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anti-EBV therapy with TAF in combination with ocrelizumab or rituximab will therefore provide&#xD;
      a synergistic approach to cover the whole EBV reservoir.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary aims of the proposed trial are to determine if TAF, at the standard dose of 25&#xD;
      mg/day administered for 12 months:&#xD;
&#xD;
      i) is safe and well-tolerated by individuals with RRMS over a period of treatment of 12&#xD;
      months; ii) leads to an overall improvement in fatigue, as assessed by the Modified Fatigue&#xD;
      Impact Scale by 12 months; and iii) causes a reduction in serum concentrations of&#xD;
      neurofilament light chain (NfL), a marker of neuronal damage in MS.&#xD;
