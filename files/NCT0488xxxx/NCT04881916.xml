      The purpose of this research study is to obtain and study clinical history, and tissue and&#xD;
      saliva specimens if available from participants with Anaplastic Lymphoma Kinase-ALK+&#xD;

      The purpose of this study is to establish a registry of clinical data and tumor specimens of&#xD;
      patients with advanced ALK+ non-small lung cancer (NSCLC) (defined as NSCLC harboring an ALK&#xD;
      gene rearrangement). This will allow in-depth, comprehensive genomic and immunophenotypic&#xD;
      analyses of ALK+ tumors. Together with the clinical data, these biologic specimens will&#xD;
      enable the conduct of basic and translational research to identify genomic and immunologic&#xD;
      markers associated with clinical outcomes for ALK+ patients.&#xD;

             United States, or older, at the time of consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Histologically or cytologically confirmed advanced stage IIIB-IIIC not amenable to&#xD;
             curative approach multi-modality (e.g., chemoradiation and/or surgery) treatment, or&#xD;
             stage IV non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC)&#xD;
