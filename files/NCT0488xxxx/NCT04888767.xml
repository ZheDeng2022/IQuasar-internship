      This study compare an usual training program (in continuous endurance) with an ITHI program&#xD;
      over a period of 3 weeks, in France. The aim is to evaluate the safety and feasibility of&#xD;
      this type of program in CF adults, and also more specifically, in subgroups:&#xD;
&#xD;
      patients divided according to the severity of their FEV1 ; patients treated with modulating&#xD;
      CFTR canal therapy ; diabetic patients on insulin ; undernourished patients.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Objectives Studies have shown good tolerance of High Intensity Interval Training (ITHI) in&#xD;
      healthy people or in COPD with similar results obtained with continuous training regimen, but&#xD;
      with less shortness of breath and muscle fatigue, greater pleasure and a positive impact on&#xD;
      glycemia. Research in CF is still scarce.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We propose to compare our usual training program (in continuous endurance) with an ITHI&#xD;
      program over a period of 3 weeks, corresponding to the length of the rehabilitation stay in&#xD;
      France. Our aim is to evaluate the safety and feasibility of this type of program in CF&#xD;
      adults, and also more specifically, in subgroups:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  patients divided according to the severity of their FEV1&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  patients treated with modulating CFTR canal therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  diabetic patients on insulin&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  undernourished patients (BMI â‰¤ 18.5)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Bicentric (Roscoff-Giens); prospective; opened; randomized; controlled&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Rehabilitation stay in hospitalization with 18 days of training, on an ergometer,&#xD;
           supervised by an APA teacher or a physiotherapist&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Control group: 5 times / week; continuous work 20 to 30 min; around the 1st aerobic&#xD;
                ventilation threshold&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Intervention group: 2 times / week: maintenance sessions + 3 times / week: IHTI&#xD;
                sessions - alternating 30s work / 30s rest repeated 6 times; at 60% of the maximum&#xD;
                heart rate at the 1st session then increase as fast and large as possible&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Distribution of the 100 patients included in a 1: 1 ratio&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Examinations / Questionnaires in current practice: medical consultation; quality of life&#xD;
           (CFQ-R); anxiety-depression (HAD); &quot;Starfish&quot; (Feelings linked to physical activity) ;&#xD;
           blood sugar (Freestyle); impedance measurement; respiratory capacity measurement ;&#xD;
           Voluntary Driving Force; walk test (TM6); dyspnea scale (Borg)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Study-specific measures: MDP (Multidimensional Profile of Dyspnea) and PACES (Physical&#xD;
           Activity Enjoyment Scale) scales&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expected results&#xD;
&#xD;
      Through this pilot study we are expecting to answer several questions:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  are the safety and tolerance of an ITHI program at least equal if not better than that&#xD;
           of a &quot;classic&quot; training?&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  what about the most severe patients?&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  could patients on modulator have ITHI training (treatment likely to increase creatine&#xD;
           kinase - muscle enzyme -)?&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  are diabetic patients more at risk of hypoglycaemia during an ITHI compared to&#xD;
           traditional training?&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  could undernourished patients participate in ITHI regimen?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Perspective If ITHI appears to be safe and well tolerated, it could be integrated into&#xD;
      &quot;classic&quot; rehabilitation programs and represent an interesting alternative, depending on the&#xD;
      profile of each patient. The effectiveness of the ITHI program will also be discussed by&#xD;
      evaluating several parameters, including 6mn walking distance test (6MWD). The emerging&#xD;
      trends would allow some recommendations and more in-depth studies.&#xD;
