  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The present project aims to test the feasibility of a new management mechanism for&#xD;
      inter-visit monitoring of adolescent patients with idiopathic scoliosis that improves the&#xD;
      quality and safety of current orthopedic treatments using information and communication&#xD;
      technologies (ICT).&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Idiopathic scoliosis is defined as a spinal deformity affecting the anteroposterior plane and&#xD;
      exceeding 10 degrees of angulation. The label idiopathic arises from ruling out other causes,&#xD;
      such as tumors, trauma or infections, that may explain the deformity. This pathology affects&#xD;
      approximately 2% of the population, being up to 5 times more frequent in girls than in boys&#xD;
      and age playing a fundamental role in the progression and worsening of the problem.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In most cases, scoliosis appears during adolescence (up to 89% of cases according to&#xD;
      studies), being very rare up to 3 years of age (between 1% and 5% of detected cases) and&#xD;
      slightly more frequent in the infantile stage (7 to 10.5% of scoliosis cases). Scoliosis&#xD;
      often does not cause pain or other complications associated with the deformity. However, as&#xD;
      the curvature deformity increases (especially after 25 degrees), complications become more&#xD;
      pronounced and treatment becomes necessary. For example, in the case of curvatures between 30&#xD;
      and 40 degrees and curves between 20 and 29 degrees that have progressed rapidly in the last&#xD;
      year (more than 5 degrees), bracing has become the indicated treatment, while more invasive&#xD;
      intervention (surgery) will be necessary in more severe cases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The prevalence of cases requiring treatment (by bracing or, in the worst case, surgery) is&#xD;
      estimated to be between 0.2 and 0.3% of the population under 18 years of age. However,&#xD;
      although in many cases scoliosis is not associated with medical complications, it has been&#xD;
      shown that, even in people with less severe curvature, this deformity is associated with&#xD;
      psychological complications, such as lower self-esteem, a more depressed mood, high alcohol&#xD;
      consumption and even suicidal ideation, which are aggravated during treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Through bracing, applied early on, it is hoped that the proper curvature of the spine will be&#xD;
      aided by the guidance imposed by the brace. However, although review studies indicate&#xD;
      promising results with this intervention, they also indicate that the use of bracing does not&#xD;
      yet possess sufficient scientific evidence. This is mainly due, as indicated by the&#xD;
      literature, to the low adherence to bracing in this population, which tends to be exaggerated&#xD;
      when evaluated retrospectively. Given that one of the best predictors of the effectiveness of&#xD;
      orthopedic treatment of scoliosis is, in fact, time in brace use, greater efforts should be&#xD;
      made to improve adherence to treatment in this population. Some authors have proposed that&#xD;
      factors such as beliefs about the pathology and treatment (e.g., &quot;I don't care about my back&quot;&#xD;
      or &quot;I think people will see the brace under my clothes&quot;), as well as the undesirable effects&#xD;
      of brace use (e.g., chafing, discomfort when sleeping, or pain), may be at least partly&#xD;
      responsible for this low adherence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With the aforementioned purpose in mind, we hope that the use of our Pain Monitor App, which&#xD;
      has been recently validated in an empirical study, will allow early detection of low&#xD;
      adherence to brace use, the appearance of undesirable effects of its use or the persistence&#xD;
      of dysfunctional beliefs. All this with the aim of acting quickly to promote their adherence&#xD;
      to brace use, make changes to the brace when it causes undesirable effects, or perform&#xD;
      psychoeducational interventions when dysfunctional beliefs about scoliosis or treatment&#xD;
      persist. As a result of the above, we expect to increase the effectiveness of the&#xD;
      intervention (better curvature evolution) and the quality of life and emotional well-being of&#xD;
      the patients. Avoiding progression of the curvature is important since surgery is associated&#xD;
      with significant post-surgical complications, such as infections and mechanical and&#xD;
      neurological problems, with low success rate and frequent need for several surgeries, while&#xD;
      untreated scoliosis in the adult is often accompanied by chronic low back pain and&#xD;
      significant instability.&#xD;
