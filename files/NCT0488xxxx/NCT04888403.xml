      The purpose of this study is to observe and evaluate the efficacy and safety of Toripalimab&#xD;

    <textblock>
      In China, the incidence of esophageal cancer has declined in recent years, but the mortality&#xD;
      rate has been ranked fourth. Morbidity and mortality were ranked sixth and fourth in all&#xD;
      malignancies, respectively. Therefore, esophageal cancer has always been a major malignant&#xD;
      tumor that threatens the health of our residents. Investigator designed a single-arm,&#xD;
      open-label, phase II trial of Toripalimab Combined With Neoadjuvant Radiotherapy and&#xD;
      Chemotherapy for locally advanced esophageal squamous cell carcinoma. The purpose of this&#xD;
      study is to observe and evaluate the efficacy and safety of Toripalimab Combined With&#xD;
      Neoadjuvant Radiotherapy and Chemotherapy for locally advanced esophageal squamous cell&#xD;
      carcinoma.&#xD;
