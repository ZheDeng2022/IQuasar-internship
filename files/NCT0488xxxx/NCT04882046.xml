  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of the study is to estimate the incidence of Jarisch-Herxheimer Reactions (JHR)&#xD;
      during antibiotic treatment of human leptospirosis cases in New Caledonia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants are patients managed in one of the 5 centres participating in the study, in whom&#xD;
      a clinical doctor suspected leptospirosis. The average number of leptospirosis cases in New&#xD;
      Caledonia is 89 per year. Given the proportion of positive diagnostic tests (approximately&#xD;
      10%) 900 inclusions are planned for this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients are included at the time of the consultation during which leptospirosis is&#xD;
      suspected, before the initiation of their antibiotic therapy and independently of the&#xD;
      clinical form they presented.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data (socio-demographic and health) and blood samples will be collected at 3 points in the&#xD;
      study: at baseline, three hours and six hours after antibiotic treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will allow better management of patients with leptospirosis.&#xD;

      The objective of the study is to estimate the incidence of Jarisch-Herxheimer Reactions (JHR)&#xD;
      during antibiotic treatment of human leptospirosis cases in New Caledonia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives of the study are to describe the JHR during leptospirosis (describe&#xD;
      clinical, haemodynamic and cytokine response parameters), to describe the effects of the&#xD;
      progressive introduction of antibiotic (ATB) for the treatment of leptospirosis and to&#xD;
      harmonise management practices for patients with leptospirosis in NC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants are patients managed in one of the 5 centres participating in the study, in whom&#xD;
      a clinical doctor suspected leptospirosis. The average number of leptospirosis cases in New&#xD;
      Caledonia (NC) is 89 per year. Given the proportion of positive diagnostic tests&#xD;
      (approximately 10%) 900 inclusions are planned for this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients are included at the time of the consultation during which leptospirosis is&#xD;
      suspected, before the initiation of their antibiotic therapy and independently of the&#xD;
      clinical form they presented.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood samples will be collected at 3 points in the study: at baseline, three hours and six&#xD;
      hours after antibiotic treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will be collected at 4 points in the study: at baseline, three hours, six hours after&#xD;
      antibiotic treatment and one day after treatment introduction (last point by phone call).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The data obtained will allow us to describe for the first time, in a prospective study, the&#xD;
      JHR associated with leptospirosis in a significant number of patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The data obtained will also help to describe the impact of a therapeutic strategy on the&#xD;
      evolution of the disease, which has not yet been evaluated. This study also aims to help&#xD;
      harmonise the management of patients with leptospirosis in NC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will allow better management of patients with leptospirosis.&#xD;
