    <textblock>
      The objective of this research is to build a collection of non-invasive retinal imaging (OCT&#xD;
      and OCTA) in order to investigate the incidence and impact of retinal damage in patients who&#xD;
      have or have had COVID-19.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This monocentric study is aimed at 2 types of patients:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Those who have been hospitalized for Covid-19 during the epidemic&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Newly infected and diagnosed patients Covid-19&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the patient's inclusion, an ophthalmologic assessment will be performed including :&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  visual acuity,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  SD-OCT + multicolor,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  OCT-A,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  color retinography,&#xD;
&#xD;
      Depending on the data of the ophthalmological examination (normal or abnormal), a follow-up&#xD;
      will be proposed within the framework of the research, with possibly at most 2 additional&#xD;
      visits for the follow-up of the evolution of the lesions which will be found on the images.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fundus examination, optical coherence tomography (OCTA) and optical coherence tomography&#xD;
      angiography (OCTA) in all COVID-19 patients may detect retinal lesions. In addition, if a&#xD;
      correlation is demonstrated between clinical and paraclinical parameters and between disease&#xD;
      severity and retinal vascular damage in non-invasive imaging (OCT and OCTA), this would allow&#xD;
      a better understanding of the pathophysiology of the disease, as well as factors that may&#xD;
      influence disease severity and the mechanisms potentially responsible for the observed&#xD;
      disorders.&#xD;
