  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study seeks to test the efficacy of a psychosocial intervention to empower advanced&#xD;
      cancer patients and their caregivers and improve their quality of life (QOL). The program,&#xD;
      called NextSTEPS, provides skills training in six domains that are central to patient and&#xD;
      caregiver QOL: self-care, stress management, symptom management, effective communication,&#xD;
      problem-solving, and social support.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this study, 200 advanced cancer patients who are within one month of treatment initiation&#xD;
      (baseline) and their caregivers will complete baseline surveys and be randomized to NextSTEPS&#xD;
      or a usual medical care (UMC) condition. In addition to UMC, patients and caregivers in the&#xD;
      NextSTEPS condition will each receive an intervention manual and six weekly 45-minute&#xD;
      telephone counseling sessions with a trained interventionist. Patients and caregivers in both&#xD;
      the NextSTEPS and UMC conditions will complete follow-up surveys at 8 weeks (2 months), 4&#xD;
      months, and 6 months post-baseline.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The specific aims are to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Determine the impact of NextSTEPS on patient physical and emotional QOL, palliative care&#xD;
           utilization, and satisfaction with care relative to UMC. We hypothesize that at 8 weeks&#xD;
           (2 months), and 4 and 6 months, patients in NextSTEPS will have less symptom burden,&#xD;
           less emotional distress, greater palliative care utilization, and greater satisfaction&#xD;
           with care relative to patients in UMC.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Determine the impact of NextSTEPS on caregiver self-care, physical and emotional QOL,&#xD;
           and satisfaction with care. We hypothesize that at 8 weeks, and 4 and 6 months,&#xD;
           caregivers in NextSTEPS will report more self-care, better physical QOL, less emotional&#xD;
           distress, and greater satisfaction with care relative to caregivers in UMC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary/exploratory aims and hypotheses are to:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Examine the effects of the NextSTEPS intervention on Self Determination Theory (SDT)&#xD;
      constructs. We hypothesize that NextSTEPS will enhance patient and caregiver competence,&#xD;
      autonomy, and relatedness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Test whether the SDT constructs of competence, autonomy and relatedness mediate the effects&#xD;
      of NextSTEPS on patient/caregiver outcomes as hypothesized.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Explore whether sociodemographic (e.g., age, gender), medical (e.g., disease stage,&#xD;
      comorbidities), and relationship factors (e.g., whether the caregiver is a spouse/partner or&#xD;
      other family member) moderate the effects of NextSTEPS on patient/caregiver competence,&#xD;
      autonomy, and relatedness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      NextSTEPS fills an important service gap by providing education, skills training, and support&#xD;
      to advanced cancer patients and their caregivers shortly after diagnosis. Home-based&#xD;
      telephone delivery will facilitate dissemination and outreach. By empowering families with&#xD;
      the skills they need to coordinate care and meet the challenges of advanced cancer together,&#xD;
      NextSTEPS holds great promise for improving patient and caregiver QOL, and the quality of&#xD;
      palliative and supportive care in cancer.&#xD;

    <description>Intervention sessions are delivered by a Masters level trained interventionist. During sessions, the interventionist will: conduct the weekly symptom screen, review content, answer questions, ensure skills mastery through homework review, and work with participants to develop action plans and identify/overcome barriers to self-care/caregiving. Patients and caregivers will receive individual calls from the interventionist for sessions 1, 2, and 3, and participate together for sessions 4, 5, and 6 via speakerphone.</description>
