  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Tooth decay affects 75% of Malaysian preschool children, most of which remain untreated.&#xD;
      Untreated decay can cause pain, and impair nutritional status and physical growth. In 2012,&#xD;
      nearly 4,000 children in Malaysia were referred for hospital paediatric dental services&#xD;
      because of early childhood caries. The realistic management of these children would have been&#xD;
      treatment under general anaesthesia or sedation, at considerable cost to the state, and&#xD;
      distress to the children and families. The amount of dental disease in young children who&#xD;
      have been referred to the hospital children's dentistry service for severe caries is&#xD;
      disturbing, particularly given the fact that each district has a dental clinic and that the&#xD;
      water is very likely to be fluoridated. It is unlikely that there will ever be enough dental&#xD;
      clinics and dental practitioners to manage the amount of disease. Clearly, existing health&#xD;
      services need to be supplemented with a population-based approach to promote child oral&#xD;
      health. The investigators, therefore, propose a community trial study to investigate the&#xD;
      effectiveness of a dental health visiting service for caries control in young children. It is&#xD;
      likely that such a home-based intervention is influenced by the family dynamics in which the&#xD;
      child lives. The investigators further propose to assess the cost-effectiveness of dental&#xD;
      home visits (DHVs). Health economic evaluation can be used to assess health services to&#xD;
      ensure there is cost-efficient resource allocation. Economic evaluation is defined as the&#xD;
      comparative analysis of alternative courses of action in terms of both their costs and&#xD;
      consequences. A health intervention is considered cost-effective when it produces acceptable&#xD;
      costs and health benefits. Economic data are now recognized as important due to the fact that&#xD;
      dental disease is very common and expensive for the health care system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study was conducted in collaboration with the National Oral Health of Pre-school Survey&#xD;
      (NOHPS), in which a sub-sample will be followed up for two years. The NOHPS is a national&#xD;
      survey of the oral health of 5-year-olds that takes place every 10 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a randomized controlled trial to assess the cost-effectiveness of home-based DHVs&#xD;
      with families of children at high risk of caries in caries prevention compared to children&#xD;
      receiving oral health information in the form of an education leaflet (ELs) alone. A&#xD;
      collaborative project with the Oral Health Division (OHD) at the Ministry of Health is&#xD;
      proposed. The OHD will provide access to a sub-sample from the National Oral Health Preschool&#xD;
      Survey (NOHPS), with clinical dental health data.&#xD;

    <description>No drugs were given in the Intervention. The intervention group received Dental Home Visits consisted of 6 monthly home visits by oral health therapists/dental home visitors where they deliver dental care advice to the parents for durations of approximately 30 minutes until follow-up at two years. Dental Home Education Leaflets (DHELs) and oral health messages were delivered through a personalized approach that avoids direct persuasion. These messages included information on daily tooth brushing with fluoride toothpaste, controlling dietary sugar intake, and the need for regular dental check-ups. The families were also be provided with information about local dental services available in their vicinity and how to access these services.</description>
