      This is an open-label, single-arm, randomized, evaluator-blinded repeat insult patch testing&#xD;
      (RIPT) study wherein test product is applied under an occlusive dressing to the upper back or&#xD;
      arm continuously and repeatedly to the same site for a period of 21 days. Three&#xD;
      concentrations of PBI-100 Topical Cream and vehicle (placebo cream) will be applied to the&#xD;
      skin of each subject. In addition, one site will be treated with a positive control and&#xD;
      another site will be treated with a plain cotton cloth patch and will serve as a negative&#xD;
      control.&#xD;
