  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Mild to moderate blepharoptosis with good levator function is usually corrected by levator&#xD;
      muscle resection or advancement with their modifications with high success rate. Levator&#xD;
      plication technique has been strongly suggested in patients with mild to moderate ptosis,&#xD;
      advocated by its simple and rapid recovery. Its drawback is a high recurrence rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We suggest a modified tucking technique that improves the force of eyelid elevation with&#xD;
      preserved normal anatomy of Muller's muscle and conjunctiva with less disturbance to the&#xD;
      Levator muscle aponeurosis. It is a short procedure, less complications with good aesthetic&#xD;
      results and high patient's satisfaction.&#xD;

      A prospective single-centre study enrolling 180 patients with blepharoptosis at Ain Shams&#xD;
      University Hospitals from March 2017 to February 2019. Patients of unilateral or bilateral&#xD;
      mild to moderate ptosis with good levator function (more than 8 mm) were included. Those with&#xD;
      severe, traumatic, recurrent, mechanical ptosis, Marcus-Gunn jaw winking syndrome, third&#xD;
      nerve palsy, absent Bell's phenomenon, or abnormal ocular motility were excluded. The&#xD;
      follow-up was at one week, one month, three months, six months, and one year visits.&#xD;
      Functional outcome was assessed by analysis of the upper eyelid margin position in relation&#xD;
      to the superior limbus and classified as very good (2 mm), good (2-4 mm), poor (5 mm) and&#xD;
      preoperative to postoperative difference in marginal reflex distance (MRD). The aesthetic&#xD;
      outcome was assessed in the form of symmetry of eyelid height, lid contour, lid crease&#xD;
      presence, and degree of patient's postoperative satisfaction.&#xD;

    <description>The upper eyelid crease was marked for the incision site, up to 5-7 mm from the lid margin, guided by the fellow eyelid crease position. The skin incision was done and the orbicularis occuli muscle was dissected to the tarsus. The anterior surface of the tarsal plate was then identified with the aponeurosis at its insertion, the orbital septum was then opened with a resultant fat prolapse, and the levator aponeurosis exposed until Whitnall's ligament. Three double-armed 5/0 polyester white braided, non-absorbable sutures, with spatulated needle 1/4 circle (Astralen, Assut Medical SÃ rl, Pully-Lausanne, Switzerland) were passed between the levator aponeurosis near Whitnall's ligament and the anterior surface of the tarsus in a mattress form</description>

    <description>A modified levator muscle tucking procedure.The level of sutures was determined according to the levator muscle function and the desired eyelid height. The middle (main) suture was taken first at the level of the medial part of the pupil and was tightened to keep the lid height at the superior limbus and the other two sutures (medial and lateral) were then adjusted. A spindle-shaped, horizontal part of the levator aponeurosis (2.5-3 mm wide and 0.5 mm deep) was excised at the site of insertion into the tarsus before tightening the central suture to induce strong fibrosis and adhesion between the tucked levator aponeurosis and the tarsus</description>
