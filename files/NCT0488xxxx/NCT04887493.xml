    <textblock>
      This research is to compare the efficacy and the safety of sublingual misoprostol with&#xD;
      vaginal misoprostol administration for the induction of labour for primigravida at 41 or more&#xD;
      weeks of pregnancy. In routine practice, misoprostol 25µg is used by per vaginal route for&#xD;
      the induction of labour in Bhutan. The misoprostol dose is given repeatedly every 4 hours to&#xD;
      a maximum of 6 dosages. The per vaginal route is found to be very effective and safe for the&#xD;
      induction of labour. But, patient compliance is poor and increasing the risk of neonatal&#xD;
      sepsis since it has to be inserted into vagina every 4 hours. To overcome these problems with&#xD;
      per vaginal route, this study is developed to explore the efficacy and safety of misoprostol&#xD;
      use by sublingual routes for the induction of labour. Misoprostol can be used by sublingual,&#xD;
      oral or per vaginal route as per the findings of the other studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the finding of this study proves sublingual use of misoprostol is safe and efficient for&#xD;
      the induction of labour, the current practice of using misoprostol by vaginal route will be&#xD;
      changed to sublingual route in Bhutan.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Induction of labour is an intervention intended to artificially initiate uterine contraction&#xD;
      in pregnant women who are not in labour. It is a common practice to interrupt the pregnancy&#xD;
      at 41 weeks of gestation and deliver the fetus when continuation of pregnancy is no longer&#xD;
      considered safe.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The methods of induction can be non-pharmacological or pharmacological. Prostaglandins and&#xD;
      oxytocin are the commonly used drugs for induction of labour.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prostaglandins are the current drug of choice and have been used for labour induction in&#xD;
      pregnant women with an unfavourable cervix. Misoprostol is a synthetic analogue of&#xD;
      prostaglandin E1 and it has been extensively and successfully used for labour induction due&#xD;
      to its efficacy, low cost and stability at room temperature. Misoprostol can be used by oral,&#xD;
      vaginal or sublingual routes for the labour induction. Among which vaginal misoprostol has&#xD;
      been extensively used and shown to be an effective method of induction of labour. Sublingual&#xD;
      route of misoprostol is equally safe and effective for induction of labour. In fact,&#xD;
      sublingual route of misoprostol administration is found to be more effective in induction of&#xD;
      labour as compared to vaginal route. This sublingual route is appealing for several reasons,&#xD;
      including the convenience, easy to administer and a higher patient's acceptability. In&#xD;
      contrast to per vaginal misoprostol administration, sublingual route avoids repeated per&#xD;
      vaginal examination which is a risk factor for neonatal sepsis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Bhutan per vaginal misoprostol is being extensively used for induction of labour by the&#xD;
      Gynecologists. The neonatal sepsis rate is 19 per 1000 in Bhutan, which is the highest in&#xD;
      Asia. The high rate of neonatal sepsis in Bhutan is found to be associated with repeated&#xD;
      vaginal examination done during pregnancy to administer misoprostol dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      No study has been conducted in Bhutan to find out the safety and efficacy of per vaginal&#xD;
      misoprostol use nor is there any study on sublingual use of misoprostol for the induction of&#xD;
      labour.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, this study is developed to explore whether sublingual misoprostol may be tried as&#xD;
      a new option for induction of labour comparing the efficacy of administration of sublingual&#xD;
      misoprostol with vaginal misoprostol for induction of labour at term and post term&#xD;
      pregnancies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This will be a randomized clinical trial with a parallel design (simple randomization).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be conducted in Phuentsholing General Hospital, Chukha, Bhutan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study duration will be six months starting from 1st June to 30th November 2021.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the study, all the primigravida at 41 or more weeks of pregnancy admitted to Gynecology&#xD;
      ward, Phuentsholing hospital will be approached to participate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primigravid pregnant women who have consented voluntarily will be recruited for the study.&#xD;
      The study population will randomly put into two groups by simple randomization as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 1- To induce the labor with misoprostol 25µg sublingually; Group 2- To induce the labor&#xD;
      with misoprostol 25µg per vaginally.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The researchers and the study participants will not be blinded; however, the statisticians&#xD;
      who will analyze the data will be blinded to avoid possible bias in drawing the inferences.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size is calculated based on the finding of previous study which had reported with a&#xD;
      statistically significant difference of mean induction to delivery interval between&#xD;
      sublingual group and per vaginal use of misoprostol group (P&lt;0.001). The mean induction to&#xD;
      delivery interval of 13.1±4.1 hours for sublingual group as compared to 17.9±5.4 hours for&#xD;
      vaginal group(21). With 5% error and 80% power, sample size is determined by using PASS&#xD;
      (Power Analysis and Sample Size Software) 2021 software.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The total sample size is 24 from the calculation using the previous research finding.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, the current research will recruit 20 study participants in each group; group 1&#xD;
      (n=20), and group 2 (n=20).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sampling technique will be a non-purposive sampling.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Written informed consent will be obtained from the participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After obtaining ethical clearance from the Research Ethical Board of Health (REBH), Ministry&#xD;
      of Health, Thimphu, Bhutan; pregnant women who are admitted to gynecology ward for induction&#xD;
      of labor for various reasons will be approached and will take detailed history, review&#xD;
      previous medical documents, and conduct relevant general and obstetrical examination. This&#xD;
      procedure will be done to ensure correct dating of pregnancy (to avoid inducing preterm), to&#xD;
      re-confirm the indications for induction of labor and to exclude contraindications for&#xD;
      vaginal delivery. Primigravid pregnant women at 41 or more weeks of pregnancy will be&#xD;
      counseled and explained about the research purpose, objectives, methods, outcomes and the&#xD;
      benefits. If they are willing to participate in the research, the written informed consent&#xD;
      will be obtained. Eligibility criteria will be applied and the pregnant mothers who fulfill&#xD;
      the inclusion criteria will be recruited for the study from 1st June to 30th November 2021.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The enrolled pregnant women will then be randomly allocated in two groups by lottery methods.&#xD;
      Enrolled pregnant mothers will be asked to pick up a rolled paper from the lottery box which&#xD;
      will determine the study group of the subject. The group-1 will receives misoprostol 25µg by&#xD;
      sublingual route and group-2 will receives misoprostol 25µg by vaginal route. Sublingual&#xD;
      route involves placing misoprostol in the sublingual space under the tongue and the vaginal&#xD;
      route involves placing misoprostol inside the posterior fornix of vagina.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior to starting the first dose of misoprostol administration, cardiotocography (CTG) will&#xD;
      be done to ensure fetal heart rate tracing is reassuring and per vaginal examination will be&#xD;
      done to assess the Bishop's score in both the groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Per vaginal examination will be done by a female nurse maintaining optimum privacy. If the&#xD;
      fetal heart rate is reassuring and the Bishop's score is unfavorable, then induction of labor&#xD;
      with misoprostol will commence. Both groups will receive repeat dose of misoprostol 25µg&#xD;
      every 4 hours up to a maximum of 6 dosages. The drug will be administered sublingually or&#xD;
      vaginally according to the allocated group by the female nurse.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pregnant women will never be left unattended once the induction of labor has started. Close&#xD;
      monitoring of fetal heart rate and uterine activity will be done for 30 minutes after every&#xD;
      dose of misoprostol for both the study group. This is to look for changes in fetal heart rate&#xD;
      and for early detection of rare occurrence of uterine hyperstimulation with the peak&#xD;
      concentration of misoprostol in the circulation. If there is uterine hyperstimulation&#xD;
      (presence of five or more contractions per 10 minutes for at least 20 minutes) patient will&#xD;
      be monitored with continuous CTG, put patient on left lateral position, give oxygen&#xD;
      (8-10L/min) and hydrate with IV fluids. If hyperstimulation fails to resolve and the abnormal&#xD;
      fetal heart rate persists (absence of acceleration, presence of late or variable&#xD;
      deceleration, reduced variability, bradycardia or tachycardia) Inj. salbutamol 100 µg IV over&#xD;
      1-2 minute will be given. If CTG remains suggestive of fetal compromise despite the&#xD;
      management for hyperstimulation, pregnancy will be terminated by emergency caesarean section.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior to repeating the misoprostol dose, repeat CTG will be done to ensure reassuring fetal&#xD;
      heart rate tracing in both the groups. For group 2 per vaginal examination will be done every&#xD;
      4 hours to assess Bishop score and to give a repeat dose of misoprostol per vaginal route.&#xD;
      For group 1, repeated per vaginal examination will not be done, rather repeat misoprostol&#xD;
      dose will be placed in the sublingual space under the tongue. The repeat misoprostol dose&#xD;
      will be administered only if fetal heart rate tracing is reassuring and there is no uterine&#xD;
      contraction or labor pain. If the fetal heart rate tracing is non-reassuring (fetal&#xD;
      distress), the repeat dose of misoprostol will be withheld and pregnant mothers will be put&#xD;
      to left lateral position, IV fluids (crystalloids) will be given to hydrate, oxygen will be&#xD;
      administered by face mask at 6-10L/min and CTG will be repeated after 30minutes. If the fetal&#xD;
      heart rate tracing is still non-reassuring (features of fetal distress persists) even after&#xD;
      managing with hydration and oxygen administration, pregnancy will be terminated by emergency&#xD;
      caesarean section.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If fetal heart rate tracing returns to reassuring status after hydration and oxygenation, the&#xD;
      misoprostol dose will be restarted. Once the uterine contraction or labor pain starts, the&#xD;
      repeat dose of misoprostol will be withheld and per vaginal examination will be done for both&#xD;
      the study groups to assess the Bishop score. Once the cervix becomes ripe or the Bishop score&#xD;
      is favorable, and in absence of uterine contraction or labour pain, induction with oxytocin&#xD;
      will be done after 4 hours of the last dose of misoprostol administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once the patient is in active labor, augmentation with oxytocin will be done if there is&#xD;
      inadequate uterine contraction. Labor process will be closely monitored for progression of&#xD;
      labor and to assess fetal and maternal conditions using partograph. Routine active management&#xD;
      of the third stage of labor will be done.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Newborn will be assessed for Apgar score at 1 minute and again at 5 minutes after birth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In both the study groups if labor fails to get induced even after 6 dosages of misoprostol&#xD;
      (failed induction), and if Bishop score is unfavorable; induction with Foley's catheter will&#xD;
      be offered to the pregnant mother. Foley's catheter (16F) will be placed by transcervically&#xD;
      and inflate the balloon with 30-50 ml of water. Unless balloon expels out it is kept in situ&#xD;
      for 12 hours. After 12 hours Foley's catheter will be removed by deflating the balloon. If&#xD;
      the labour fails to get induced or the Bishop score is unfavorable even after the mechanical&#xD;
      induction with Foley's catheter, pregnancy will be terminated by caesarean section.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the delivering the baby, and when mothers are free of pain, they will be asked to give&#xD;
      a rating on the satisfaction score scale on the induction of labour route they received.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The interviewer administered pre-tested questionnaire will be used to collect the data.&#xD;
      Pre-testing of the questionnaire will be done to the gynecology ward nursing staff.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary outcome is to measure the number of pregnant mothers who have a vaginal delivery&#xD;
      within 24 hours of the induction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcomes are; to find out the time taken from induction to delivery, to find out&#xD;
      the total dosages of misoprostol required for induction, to find out the maternal and&#xD;
      neonatal outcomes, to measure the satisfaction score and to analyze the Apgar score at birth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study proposal is submitted to the Research Ethical Board of Health (REBH), Ministry of&#xD;
      Health, Thimphu, for ethical clearance and an expedited review. The research will commence&#xD;
      only after obtaining ethical clearance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The collected data will be captured and double entered using Epidata 3.1.2 (Odense, Denmark)&#xD;
      and validated to avoid data entry errors. The data will then be exported to SPSS format for&#xD;
      further analysis. The data will be analyzed using SPSS version 23. Descriptive statistics&#xD;
      commands such as frequencies, percentages, mean, median, confidence interval, and standard&#xD;
      deviation will be used to describe the study variables. The Chi-square test will be used for&#xD;
      categorical variables outcome variables. Student's t-test will be employed for A p value&#xD;
      &lt;0.05 will be considered statistically significant with confidence interval of 95%.&#xD;
