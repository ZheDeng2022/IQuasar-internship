  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Older people have been one of the most affected by the Covid-19 pandemic. Restrictive&#xD;
      measures to prevent the spread of the virus have affected the lifestyle of older people,&#xD;
      which have reduced their level of physical activity. A sedentary lifestyle has negative&#xD;
      health consequences, such as increased frailty and decreased functional capacity. The aim of&#xD;
      the study is to apply a program of therapeutic exercise in outdoor fitness parks to prevent&#xD;
      the complications of sedentary lifestyle. Community-dwelling older adults belonging will&#xD;
      participate in an outdoor program to keep security measures and prevent contagion.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline to 16 weeks follow-up.</time_frame>
    <description>A validated test to identify frail older adults. The score ranges from 0 to 12 points.&#xD;
The lowest scores are for people with the highest degree of frailty.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>2 minute stair test</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline to 16 weeks follow-up.</time_frame>
    <description>Test that evaluates cardiorespiratory endurance. There are reference tables that provide a percentile of resistance based on the age and gender of the participant.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Borg Rating of Perceived Exertion Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline to 16 weeks follow-up.</time_frame>
    <description>Exertion rating based on a 6 to 20 rating scale may provide a fairly good estimate of the actual heart rate during physical activity.&#xD;
Higher scores imply a greater degree of perceived exertion.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>IPAQ-E Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline to 16 weeks follow-up.</time_frame>
    <description>Questionnaire that evaluates the level of physical activity. The time spent on activities of different intensity during the last 7 days is recorded. The score is calculated in METs-minute-week (MMW). METs refer to a metabolic expenditure rate. A greater number of MMW, greater amount of physical activity is done weekly.</description>

    <description>There will be two weekly sessions of 45 minutes, outdoors in outdoor fitness parks. The components of balance, gait, resistance, strength and elasticity will be worked on and breathing exercises will be performed. The sessions will be guided and dosed by physiotherapists, considering the level of perception of effort. Indications will be given to carry out other sessions of 60 to 120 minutes of therapeutic walking (minimum speed of 4 km/hour) during the week, to complete the 150-300 minutes per week of physical activity recommended by the WHO.</description>
