  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study will be conducted in patients with solid tumors for whom single-agent docetaxel, in&#xD;
      the dose of 75 mg/m2, is a suitable treatment option. Each patient, meeting all the inclusion&#xD;
      criteria and none of the exclusion criteria, will receive test or reference product in a&#xD;
      cross over manner based on randomization schedule. A balance between T-R and R-T&#xD;
      randomization sequence will be ensured using statistical techniques. Blood samples for PK&#xD;
      assessment will be collected prior to and after start of intravenous infusion on Day 1&#xD;
      (Period I), Day 22 (Period II)&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      46 patients will be enrolled in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The dosing schedule will be as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Period I (Day 1): Patients will receive 75 mg/m2 dose of docetaxel injection for infusion&#xD;
      (either test or reference product) on the first day of the chemotherapy cycle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Period II (Day 22): Patients will be crossover to another treatment arm to receive 75 mg/m2&#xD;
      dose of docetaxel injection for infusion (either test or reference product depending of&#xD;
      crossover sequence) on the first day of the next chemotherapy cycle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 17 blood samples for PK assessment will be collected during each period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The pre-infusion blood sample of 06 mL (0.000 hr) will be collected within 5 minutes prior to&#xD;
      start of infusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Day 1 (Period I) and Day 22# (Period II):&#xD;
&#xD;
      The blood samples of 06 mL each will be drawn at 0.500 (30 minutes), 0.667 (40 minutes) and&#xD;
      0.833 (50 minutes) during infusion, 1.000 hour* (immediately at the actual end of infusion),&#xD;
      and at 0.083 (5 minutes), 0.167 (10 minutes), 0.333 (20 minutes), 0.500 (30 minutes), 1.000,&#xD;
      2.000, 3.000, 6.000, 8.000, 12.000, 24.000 and 48.000 hours after the end of the docetaxel&#xD;
      infusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Employing the estimated concentration time profiles of Unbound Docetaxel &amp; Total Docetaxel&#xD;
      following variables will be calculated:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary variables: Cmax, AUC0-t and AUC0-∞&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary variable: Tmax, t1/2, Kel, Vd, CL and AUC_%Extrap_obs&#xD;
&#xD;
      Criteria for evaluation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      For Unbound Docetaxel &amp; Total Docetaxel, based on the statistical results of 90% confidence&#xD;
      intervals for the geometric least square mean ratio (T/R) for the pharmacokinetic parameters&#xD;
      Cmax, AUC0-t and AUC0-∞, conclusions will be drawn whether test formulation is bioequivalent&#xD;
      to reference formulation. Acceptance range for bioequivalence is 80.00% - 125.00% for 90%&#xD;
      confidence intervals of the geometric least square means ratio (T/R) for Cmax, AUC0-t and&#xD;
      AUC0-∞.&#xD;
