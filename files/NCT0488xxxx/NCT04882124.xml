  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 2 study in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) to&#xD;
      assess the efficacy, pharmacodynamics (PD), pharmacokinetics (PK), and safety of two dose&#xD;
      levels of CSJ117 in comparison to placebo. For this, the impact of CSJ117 on disease symptom&#xD;
      burden and lung function will be explored.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, participant- and investigator-blinded, placebo-controlled, parallel&#xD;
      group, multicenter study with two fixed-dose levels of CSJ117 (4 mg, 8 mg) administered&#xD;
      once-daily via oral inhalation over 12 weeks in participants with COPD, prone for&#xD;
      exacerbations and symptomatic at baseline despite background maintenance triple therapy&#xD;
      (inhaled corticosteroids/long acting beta-2 agonist/long acting muscarinic antagonist&#xD;
      (ICS/LABA/LAMA) combination, standard of care in this population) for at least three months&#xD;
      prior to screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Screening period of up to 2 weeks to assess eligibility.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Run-in period of 4 weeks where participants will be placed on fixed-dose triple&#xD;
           background therapy (ICS/LABA/LAMA) that will be used until the patient's last study&#xD;
           treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Treatment period of 12 weeks. Participants will be stratified by eosinophil levels and&#xD;
           then randomized 1:1:1 to either 4 mg CSJ117, 8 mg CSJ117, or placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Follow-up period of 55 days following the last dose of study drug. The primary objective&#xD;
           of the study is to assess the effect of CSJ117 on disease/symptom burden after 12 weeks&#xD;
           of treatment.&#xD;

    <description>The Evaluating Respiratory Symptoms (E-RS) scale is based on the 11 respiratory symptom items included in the EXACT Tool (a validated 14-item electronic questionnaire). These 11 items generate a total score of 0-40, with higher scores indicating more severe respiratory symptoms.</description>

    <description>The COPD assessment test (CAT) is a short instrument used to quantify the symptom burden of COPD and will be used to assess the health status of participants. The assessment consists of 8 items, each presented as a semantic 6-point differential scale, providing a total score out of 40. A higher score indicates a worse health status.</description>

Total score ranges between 0 and 100, with higher scores indicating greater impairment of health status.</description>
