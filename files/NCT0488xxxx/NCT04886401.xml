  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Therapeutic antibodies that block the programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1)/programmed death-1&#xD;
      (PD-1) pathway have revolutionized immuno-oncology by inducing robust and durable responses&#xD;
      in patients with various cancer including advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC).&#xD;
      However, these responses only occur in a subset of patients, even in case of PD-L1&#xD;
      overexpression. Elucidating the determinants of response and resistance but also of severe&#xD;
      immune-mediated adverse events is key to improving outcomes and developing new treatment&#xD;
      strategies. Biomarkers that predict immune checkpoint inhibitors efficacy and toxicity are&#xD;
      urgently needed and could emerge from characterization of tumor microenvironment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of PREDICTION project is to elucidate response and toxicity predictive&#xD;
      immunophenotypic signatures using a new in situ multiplexed strategy with imaging mass&#xD;
      cytometry Hyperion. Patients treated with anti-PD-1 pembrolizumab will be selected on their&#xD;
      response and toxicity profiles. Then, tumor samples will be analysed with Hyperion&#xD;
      technology, allowing delineation of cell subpopulations and cell-cell interactions,&#xD;
      highlighting tumor heterogeneity and to determine correlations between response and toxicity&#xD;
      features. The number of co-analysable markers enables global vision on the same tissue&#xD;
      section. A better understanding of the tumor microenvironment complex system will lead to&#xD;
      discover new predictive biomarkers potentially transferable to current practice.&#xD;

        All-comer adults with advanced NSCLC and a PD-L1 TPS of 50% or greater, measured via IHC&#xD;
        assays on a tumor biopsy sample, and treated with first-line pembrolizumab. Anti-PD-1&#xD;
        monotherapy was infused every three weeks until disease progression (according to RECIST&#xD;
        criteria v1.1) or unacceptable toxicity, according to the National Cancer Institute Common&#xD;
        Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) v4.0. Exclusion criteria were prior&#xD;
        exposure to immunotherapy/chemotherapy without recent biopsy before starting pembrolizumab&#xD;
        or unavailable/insufficient tumor tissue.&#xD;
