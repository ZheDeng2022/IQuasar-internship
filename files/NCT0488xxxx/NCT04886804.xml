  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study has 2 parts. The first part is open to adults with different types of advanced&#xD;
      cancer (solid tumours with changes in the HER2 gene) for whom previous treatment was not&#xD;
      successful. The second part is open to people with non-small cell lung cancer with a specific&#xD;
      mutation in the HER2 gene.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of the first study part is to find the highest dose of a medicine called BI&#xD;
      1810631 the participants can tolerate. Once this dose is found, it will be used in the second&#xD;
      study part to tests whether BI 1810631 can make tumours shrink.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, BI 1810631 is given to people for the first time. Participants take BI 1810631&#xD;
      as tablets once a day or twice a day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participants are in the study for as long as they benefit from and can tolerate&#xD;
      treatment. Study doctors regularly check the participants' health and monitor the tumours.&#xD;
      The doctors also take note of any unwanted effects that could have been caused by BI 1810631.&#xD;
