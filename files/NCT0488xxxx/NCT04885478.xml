      Introduction: Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has caused a global pandemic.&#xD;
      Epidemiological and clinical inter-individual differences, symptomatology, recovery and&#xD;
      humoral response against Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) are key&#xD;
      factors to better understand and predict the course of the pandemic. As Health Care Workers&#xD;
      (HCWs) are caring for infected patients they are more susceptible to infection, which not&#xD;
      only is critical for their own health but also because it results in a shortage of HCWs that&#xD;
      seriously affects health services. Thus, maintaining the health and welfare of HCWs and&#xD;
      enabling their rapid return to work is vital to overcome this crisis. The ProHEpiC-19 cohort&#xD;
      presents data on the immune response of HCWs infected with SARS-CoV-2. This dynamic cohort&#xD;
      was started in March 2020 and still continues including participants.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary: To consolidate a prospective cohort of Health Care Workers (HCWs) to generate&#xD;
      epidemiological and clinical high quality data. This information will be relevant to improve&#xD;
      health policies and clinical COVID-19 protocols. This cohort will also be used as an ongoing&#xD;
      platform to implement SARS-CoV-2 research projects with particular emphasis on incidence&#xD;
      rate, reinfection, vaccines, and long term immune response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To determine the kinetics of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies and cellular immune response in&#xD;
           early, mid, and long periods of immunization.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To assess the relation between clinical variables and initial RT-PCR results with the&#xD;
           interindividual differences in the immune response in early, mid, and long periods of&#xD;
           immunization.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To analyze differentially expressed cytokines as biomarkers of disease progression in&#xD;
           early, mid, and long periods of immunization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods and analysis: Longitudinal, dynamic, prospective cohort study with a 12-month&#xD;
      follow-up, which is being conducted in 4 primary-care centres and one hospital of Northern&#xD;
      Metropolitana Nord of Barcelona (Spain). For now, the study consists of 1350 participants&#xD;
      divided into 2 cohorts: 1) Healthy-Exposed HCWs: 675 not infected by SARS-CoV-2 (RT-PCR with&#xD;
      a negative result and negative SARS-CoV-2 antibodies at baseline) and 2) Infected HCWs: 675&#xD;
      symptomatic participants (those with new persistent cough, temperature ≥37.5°C, anosmia, or&#xD;
      ageusia or other compatible symptoms with COVID-19) or asymptomatic participants diagnosed by&#xD;
      positive RT-PCR test and/or SARS-CoV-2 antibodies (IgM, IgG at baseline). Primary outcomes&#xD;
      include: humoral and cellular immune response, quantitative antibodies to SARS-Cov-2,&#xD;
      SARS-CoV-2 antibody levels related to progression phenotype, clinical spectrum of SARS-Cov-2,&#xD;
      symptomatology, demographics and other variables that may be predictive of immune response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up: baseline, 15 days, 1, 3, 6, 9 and 12 months. Findings to date: Current literature&#xD;
      has shown that the immune response is maintained for a minimum of 2 months. Nevertheless&#xD;
      little is known about the association between the immune response and the progression&#xD;
      phenotype of COVID-19 .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Future plans: This prospective cohort offers the possibility to study associations between&#xD;
      immune response and progression phenotype according to age and gender as well as long-term&#xD;
      immune response. In turn, we will be able to examine possible cumulative effects, taking into&#xD;
      account several clinical variables. The study is ongoing and we plan to extend it to increase&#xD;
      the size of the cohort until 2024.&#xD;
