    <textblock>
      This study is being conducted to determine if patients with compromised B-cell function due&#xD;
      to anti-CD20 therapy and newly diagnosed COVID-19 infection benefit from convalescent plasma.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a retrospective cohort study comparing patients, with newly diagnosed COVID-19&#xD;
      infection, previously treated with anti-CD20 drugs for diseases including vasculitis or&#xD;
      hematologic malignancy, who are given high titer convalescent plasma with similar patients&#xD;
      receiving usual care that does not include convalescent plasma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goals are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To describe the natural course of COVID-19 in patients previously treated with anti-CD20&#xD;
           drugs for diseases such as vasculitis and hematologic malignancies. The investigators'&#xD;
           hypothesis is that patients who acquire COVID-19 preceded by recent anti-CD20 therapy&#xD;
           develop a prolonged course of COVID-19 infection which is not improved by remdesivir and&#xD;
           immunomodulator agents alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To quantify the risk for each outcome among patients with COVID-19 according to the time&#xD;
           they had received anti-CD20 therapy. The hypothesis is that patients with COVID-19 may&#xD;
           be less responsive to COVID-19 directed therapy when anti-CD20 was given more recently&#xD;
           (e.g., less than 6 months) prior to contracting COVID-19.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To compare the outcome of patients with COVID-19 who have received anti-CD20 drugs and&#xD;
           are treated or not with high titer convalescent plasma sufficient to reach passive&#xD;
           seroconversion. The hypothesis is that patients who have received an anti-CD20 drug&#xD;
           within the previous 6 months of their COVID-19 diagnosis have a reduced chance of&#xD;
           achieving a full recovery without first reaching passive SARS-CoV2 seroconversion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will be extracted from a data registry, built in the electronic health record (EHR)&#xD;
      environment, automatically logging subjects based on data in the electronic health record and&#xD;
      extracting relevant data metrics. This is put into a data mart nightly via an extract,&#xD;
      transform and load process used as part of routine operations and validated as part of&#xD;
      routine maintenance. Metric definitions in the registry system include validation of data as&#xD;
      being within defined limits based on the entry of EHR values to prevent outliers inconsistent&#xD;
      with reasonable data. The registry is built in the medical record system, and is checked for&#xD;
      consistency as part of the EHR architecture and maintenance. All data is extracted from the&#xD;
      Epic electronic health record. Diagnoses and procedures are coded using ICD-10-CM and&#xD;
      SNOMED-CT and laboratory data identified using appropriate LOINC codes. Rules based metrics&#xD;
      calculate demographic information and risks scores such as the Charlson comorbidity index, as&#xD;
      indicated in the attached data dictionary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome analyses will be subjected to propensity score (PS) adjustment to account for&#xD;
      non-random treatment selection. First, the investigators will estimate the PS from a&#xD;
      multivariable logistic regression in which predictors of receiving CP (within the first 30&#xD;
      days) are determined as a function of patient baseline characteristics. The propensity model&#xD;
      will include age, sex, race, APACHE-3 score, and additional baseline covariates chosen a&#xD;
      priori based on clinical relevance. Finally, comparison of the CP and no CP treatment&#xD;
      outcomes will be adjusted for baseline differences by including PS (as restricted cubic&#xD;
      spline in the logit PS to allow for nonlinear effects) in the outcome regression model with&#xD;
      the CP treatment variable. As an additional PS technique, patients treated without CP will be&#xD;
      matched to patients who received CP based on disease group (vasculitis or hematologic&#xD;
      malignancy) and propensity score within a tolerance of 0.2 standard deviations of logit-PS.&#xD;
      To avoid survival bias, the matching process will consider only the eligible controls who&#xD;
      were followed as long or longer than the time-to-first transfusion of the CP case.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Separate proportional odds logistic regression models will be fitted for the univariate WHO&#xD;
      ordinal outcome score at 30 days and for multivariate outcome scores at 30, 60 and 90 days&#xD;
      (as a repeated measures analysis), with the patients' CP status, time, baseline WHO score,&#xD;
      and PS included as independent variables. ICU-free days, defined as the number of days alive&#xD;
      and free of ICU between study entry and day 30 or day 90 will be calculated and compared&#xD;
      between CP and no CP groups using Poisson regression. For this analysis, the investigators&#xD;
      will initially start all patients at time of positive PCR in the no CP group. When patients&#xD;
      receive their first transfusion, their non-CP follow-up will be truncated, and their&#xD;
      follow-up will be restarted at time zero in the CP group. The investigators will use an&#xD;
      offset in the model to allow for difference in observation days between the two groups.&#xD;
      Lastly, treatment heterogeneity will be explored for pre-specified baseline characteristics&#xD;
      (e.g., time since anti-CD20, sex, race) by testing treatment-by-covariate interactions in the&#xD;
      outcome models. Time since anti-CD20 will be analyzed as a continuous variable using an&#xD;
      expanded cohort to consider a wider range of times (within 3 years). The investigators will&#xD;
      also examine the association between time since anti-CD20 use and study outcomes,&#xD;
      irrespective of plasma treatment. Again, time will be considered on a continuum and modeled&#xD;
      flexibly using regression splines to allow for nonlinear relationships with the outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sensitivity analyses:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stratification by category of disease (vasculitis vs. hematologic malignancies) and&#xD;
      stratification by titer of antibodies, seroconversion achieved, time (from initial positive&#xD;
      PCR) when plasma was given.&#xD;

    <description>In this observational study examining the use of convalescent plasma (CP) for treatment of CD20-depleted patients with COVID-19, we will describe the clinical course of these patients and conduct a comparative treatment analysis. &quot;Time zero&quot; will be considered the date the patient first tested positive for COVID-19, and the time-dependent nature of CP transfusion will be explicitly used in the analysis. The primary outcome of interest is the WHO ordinal outcome score measured repeatedly over 90-day follow-up. The WHO ordinal scale for Clinical Improvement ranges from 0 uninfected to 8 for Dead. Lower scores are seen with better clinical outcomes.</description>
