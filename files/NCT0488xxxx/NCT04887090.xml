      This project intends to develop a clinical randomized controlled study of ADCT (acupuncture&#xD;
      and drug compound technology) in accelerating the recovery of patients during the&#xD;
      perioperative period of pneumonectomy. The ADCT the investigators proposed is a&#xD;
      characteristic technology that uses acupuncture-related technologies to replace part of the&#xD;
      dosage of narcotic drugs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With the support of the investigators' preliminary research results of ADCT, sequential TEAS&#xD;
      (transcutaneous electrical acupoints stimulation) treatment before, during and after the&#xD;
      operation promoted recovery after thoracoscopic lung resection. Compared with&#xD;
      electroacupuncture, TEAS has the advantages of non-invasive, easy to repeat, safe, and low&#xD;
      cost, and it has widely been accepted by patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In view of the investigators' previous clinical observations and conclusions, ADCT in the&#xD;
      perioperative period of lung resection surgery can indeed play a good role in organ&#xD;
      protection and reduce surgical stress reaction. Therefore, it is necessary to further clarify&#xD;
      the advantages and application value of ADCT and provide evidence-based medical evidence. is&#xD;
      in accelerating the perioperative period of rehabilitation, it is imminent to formulate a&#xD;

      acupuncture and medicine compound technology in hospitals at all levels during the&#xD;
      perioperative period of combined Chinese and Western medicine prevention and treatment&#xD;
      programs. In order to formulate and optimize the application of ADCT in the entire&#xD;
      perioperative period of lung resection surgery, and promote the establishment of the first&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Since the first successful pulmonary resection under acupuncture anesthesia in 1960，the&#xD;
      clinical application and research of lung surgery under acupuncture anesthesia has gone&#xD;
      through 60 years，serving countless patients and achieving rich results． Looking back on its&#xD;
      development，the application of acupuncture anesthesia in lung surgery has evolved from simple&#xD;
      acupuncture anesthesia without intubation in the 1960s to combined anesthesia of acupuncture&#xD;
      and narcotic drugs under tracheal intubation in the early 1980s．In recent years，with the&#xD;
      popularization of endoscopic technology，the investigators had extensively carried out&#xD;
      thoracoscopic lung surgery under combined anesthesia of acupuncture and narcotic drugs&#xD;
      without intubation．Clinical practice and research have indicated that the thoracoscopic lung&#xD;
      surgery under combined anesthesia without intubation shows obvious advantages，and the&#xD;
      selection of intraoperative anesthesia methods，acupoints and stimulation methods are becoming&#xD;
      mature．At present，the investigators are working on expanded application of acupuncture in&#xD;
      perioperative period of lung surgery，which shows a promising future．In the future，it is&#xD;
      necessary to improve the theory of acupuncture anesthesia，unify the clinical operation&#xD;
      standards，establish an objective evaluation system，and explore the mechanism of acupuncture&#xD;
      anesthesia． This project intends to develop a clinical randomized controlled study of ADCT&#xD;
      (acupuncture and drug compound technology) in accelerating the recovery of patients during&#xD;
      the perioperative period of pneumonectomy. The ADCT the investigators proposed is a&#xD;

    <description>Before operation: The points of the meridian: Hegu, Neiguan, Chize, Zusanli, both sides are taken. TEAS (transcutaneous electrical acupoints stimulation) was performed every day for three days before the operation, using the Han's acupoint nerve stimulator to adjust the density and density waveforms at a frequency of 2/100 Hz (Hz). Current intensity is 10mA, and all acupuncture points are continuously stimulated for 30 minutes. During the operation: take the acupoints Hegu, Neiguan, Houxi, and Zhigou on both sides and give TEAS 30 minutes before induction of anesthesia. The stimulation intensity and frequency are the same as those before the operation until the end of the operation. Postoperative: Take the acupoints Chize, Waiguan, Taichong, and Yanglingquan, and take both sides. TEAS will be performed every 12 hours from the first day after surgery. Each treatment is 30 minutes until 48 hours after surgery. The intensity and frequency are the same as before surgery.</description>

    <description>Comprehensive evaluation of cardiopulmonary function, preparation of respiratory tract, active treatment of coexisting diseases before operation, correction of water and electrolyte disorders and hypoproteinemia before operation. To prevent cross-infection during the operation, the intraoperative blood volume should be supplemented within the tolerance of cardiac function, the tissue perfusion should be sufficient, and the infusion should be uniform. Strengthen respiratory care after operation, prevent cardiovascular complications, pay attention to the speed and amount of blood transfusion, encourage early activities, promote lung expansion and prevent thrombophlebitis.</description>
