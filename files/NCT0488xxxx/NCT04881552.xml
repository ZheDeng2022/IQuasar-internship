  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The rapid and complete restoration of coronary flow is a key issue in the management of&#xD;
      STEMI. Primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) is the preferred reperfusion strategy&#xD;
      associated with antithrombotic drugs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In daily practice, it is not rare that some patients may achieve reopening of the culprit&#xD;
      artery without undergoing any mechanical reperfusion therapy, which is called &quot; spontaneous&#xD;
      reperfusion &quot;. The latter is associated with improved outcomes in several studies but none of&#xD;
      these studies were done in the modern antithrombotic strategy area including new P2Y12&#xD;
      inhibitors. The aim of this study is to report the incidence, characteristics and outcomes of&#xD;
      consecutive patients with STEMI admitted for coronary angiography with angiographic clinical&#xD;
      evidence of spontaneous reperfusion in the modern medical antithrombotic strategy associated&#xD;
      with primary PCI.&#xD;
