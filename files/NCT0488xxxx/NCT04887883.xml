  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Acute exercise increases the incorporation of dietary amino acids into de novo myofibrillar&#xD;
      proteins after a single meal in controlled laboratory studies in males. It is unclear if this&#xD;
      extends to free-living settings or is influenced by training or sex. Over 24 h in a&#xD;
      free-living setting, the investigators determined the effect of training status and sex on&#xD;
      dietary phenylalanine incorporation into contractile myofibrillar and noncontractile&#xD;
      sarcoplasmic proteins after exercise.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Exogenous (e.g. diet-derived) amino acids increase muscle protein synthesis and provide the&#xD;
      building blocks for growth. While traditional infusion studies can measure the synthesis of&#xD;
      total mixed muscle or fraction-specific protein synthetic rates, the metabolic fate of&#xD;
      dietary amino acids can only be assessed by measuring the incorporation of a labelled amino&#xD;
      acid (i.e. L-[1-13C]phenylalanine) into muscle protein through the oral ingestion of a&#xD;
      intrinsically labelled food source (e.g. milk protein) . This technique has revealed in&#xD;
      controlled laboratory settings that dietary amino acids, and not endogenous amino acids&#xD;
      recycled from intracellular protein breakdown, may be preferentially utilized as precursors&#xD;
      for muscle and whole body protein synthesis Therefore, it is important to characterize the&#xD;
      incorporation of diet-derived amino acids over a 24-h post-exercise recovery period to&#xD;
      determine how RE influences their utilization as precursors for the synthesis of new muscle&#xD;
      proteins. The investigators are unaware of any studies that have examined the utilization of&#xD;
      dietary amino acids for de novo muscle protein synthesis in females, highlighting an urgent&#xD;
      need to rectify the sex-disparity in exercise-related research.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Protein requirements during resistance training have been suggested to be highest at training&#xD;
      onset with evidence suggesting moderate daily intakes (~1.2-1.4 g路kg路d-1) can support chronic&#xD;
      adaptations, although recent suggestions are that slightly higher intakes (~1.6 g路kg路d-1) may&#xD;
      optimize lean mass growth. Resistance training is associated with a reduction in whole-body&#xD;
      protein turnover but an increased net protein balance suggesting a greater efficiency of&#xD;
      whole-body amino acid utilization with training in males , although whether this also extends&#xD;
      to females is unknown. Acute RE and chronic training has been reported to increase&#xD;
      intracellular amino acid recycling in the fasted state, which would be consistent with an&#xD;
      increased amino acid efficiency. To date, however, no study has investigated whether the&#xD;
      post-exercise incorporation of dietary amino acids into myofibrillar and sarcoplasmic&#xD;
      proteins in a free-living setting is modified by training and/or sex.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary aim of the present study was to determine the dietary fate of amino acids into&#xD;
      contractile myofibrillar and noncontractile sarcoplasmic muscle proteins after acute RE in&#xD;
      the untrained and trained state over 24 h in a free-living setting. The investigators&#xD;
      hypothesized that, irrespective of sex, acute RE would increase dietary amino acid&#xD;
      incorporation in myofibrillar proteins in the untrained state with training leading to an&#xD;
      attenuated increase suggestive of a reduced reliance on dietary amino acids in the trained&#xD;
      state.&#xD;
