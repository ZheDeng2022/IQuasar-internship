  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The care of children with Cerebral Palsy is a process that continues for many years.&#xD;
      Individuals who take care of them experience musculoskeletal pain due to the difficulties&#xD;
      they experience and face pain that becomes chronic over time. For individuals who take care&#xD;
      of children with CP, determining the types of chronic pain is important in order to clarify&#xD;
      the classification criteria and for individuals to reach better living standards by tailoring&#xD;
      the treatments they will receive. Therefore, the aim of the study is to determine the types&#xD;
      of chronic pain in caregivers for children with cerebral palsy.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Numeric Pain Rating Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>1 minute</time_frame>
    <description>The NPRS was used to assess the participants' pain levels. In the NPRS, patients are asked to verbally rate the severity of their pain on a scale. The scale is composed of 0 (no pain at all) to 10 (worst imaginable pain).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Margolis Pain Diagram</measure>
    <time_frame>5 minute</time_frame>
    <description>The Margolis Pain Diagram, consists of a dorsal and a ventral drawing body, is used to assess the location and distribution of the pain. Participants will ask to point out the place where they experience pain during the preceding 4 weeks for at least 24 hours</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Central Sensitization Inventory</measure>
    <time_frame>10 minute</time_frame>
    <description>The Central Sensitization Inventory (CSI) aims to evaluate symptoms thought to be associated with nociplastic pain. The CSI consists 25 items exploring emotional and somatic disorders associated with CS. Each response is scored from 0 to 4, yielding a total score of 0 to 100. A score of 40 or higher on the CSI means the presence of nociplastic pain.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Short Form 36</measure>
    <time_frame>10 minute</time_frame>
    <description>The Short Form-36 (SF-36) is widely used to measurement of health related quality of life (HRQoL) questionnaire. SF-36 is a 36-item generic self-administered instrument consisting of 8 subscales related to various aspects of HRQoL: physical functioning, physical role, bodily pain, general health, vitality, social functioning, emotional role, and mental health. The 8 subscales are scored from 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating better health status.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Quantitative sensory test</measure>
    <time_frame>10 minute</time_frame>
    <description>Quantitative sensory testing (QST) is a psychophysical method used to quantify somatosensory function in patients. In QST will be used various stimuli static thermal (thermotest), static mechanical ( a painter brush), pinprick (a calibrated pin) and vibration ( a tuning folk). QST will interrogate whether each stimulus is considered a sensory loss (negative sign) or sensory gain (positive sign or hyperalgesia).</description>
