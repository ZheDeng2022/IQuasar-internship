  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK),&#xD;
      pharmacodynamics (PD), maximum tolerated dose (MTD) (if reached) and early signs of efficacy&#xD;
      of M4076 monotherapy in participants with solid tumors in dose escalation (Part 1A). Once the&#xD;
      recommended dose for expansion (RDE) is declared in Part 1A, a preliminary food effect&#xD;
      cohort, Part 1B, will follow at the RDE determined from Part 1A.&#xD;
