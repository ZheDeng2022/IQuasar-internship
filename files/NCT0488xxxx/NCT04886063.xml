      The objective of this study is to determine the safety and tolerability of ATH-1017 in&#xD;
      subjects with mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease who completed the 26-week randomized&#xD;
      treatment in Study ATH-1017-AD-0201 or Study ATH-1017-AD-0202.&#xD;

      This is a multicenter, seamless, open-label extension (OLEX) study of ATH-1017 treatment in&#xD;
      subjects with a clinical diagnosis of mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease who completed 26&#xD;
      weeks treatment in the randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind studies, ATH-1017-AD-0201&#xD;
      and ATH-1017-AD-0202. This OLEX study will provide additional, longer-term safety and&#xD;
      tolerability information on ATH-1017 administration up to one year in total in subjects with&#xD;
      mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease.&#xD;
