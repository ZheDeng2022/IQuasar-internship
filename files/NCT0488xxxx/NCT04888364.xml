      The aim of NS-PARK cohort are to describe the natural history of Parkinson's disease (PD),&#xD;
      and to propose patients stratification models based on PD pathophysiological mechanisms.&#xD;
      Patients are included at all PD expert centers in France. Standardized demographic,&#xD;
      diagnosis, motor and non-motor symptoms evaluation, and treatment information are collected,&#xD;
      and clinical data are updated at each visit of the patient at the center. A blood sampling is&#xD;
      perform at baseline for genetic testing and implement an associated biocollection.&#xD;

      The national clinical research network for Parkinson's disease (NS-PARK/FCRIN) reassembles&#xD;
      all expert centers in Parkinson's disease (PD) in France. Its aim is to promote clinical&#xD;
      research in Parkinson's disease and movement disorder, to better understand the&#xD;
      pathophysiology of PD, foster the development of new therapeutic strategies, and move towards&#xD;
      personalized medicine. To help centers for prescreening, a national registry of PD patients&#xD;
      followed in each centers has been implemented in 2016 to collect minimal relevant clinical&#xD;
      information of patients followed in each center including demographic data, age at diagnosis,&#xD;
      standardized motor and non-motor symptoms evaluation, and treatment. Data are updated at each&#xD;
      visit of the patient in the center. De facto, this registry became a longitudinal cohort of&#xD;
      PD patients followed in NS-PARK centers. In 2020, NS-PARK received funding to associate a&#xD;
      biocollection to this clinical cohort.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of NS-PARK cohort are to describe the natural history of PD progression in clinical&#xD;
      routine in France, to develop new models of PD describing the different progression profiles,&#xD;
      and to propose patients stratification based on PD pathophysiological mechanisms. The cohort&#xD;
      will also serve as a platform to discover new PD genes and genetic modifiers of disease&#xD;
      progression or response to treatment.&#xD;
