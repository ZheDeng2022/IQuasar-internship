      Clinical, epidemiological, therapeutic and microbiological investigation of an outbreak of&#xD;
      cutaneous Leishmaniasis that occurred among military personnel in French Guiana in 2020.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cutaneous leishmaniasis is endemic in French Guiana and represents 200 to 300 cases per year.&#xD;
      Transmission occurs after a sandfly bite, mainly during the rainy season and over almost all&#xD;
      of French Guiana. The incidence is, however, greater in forest areas, especially in recently&#xD;
      cleared areas. Nevertheless, transmission remains continuous and outbreaks remain rare and&#xD;
      little investigated. This study comes following an outbreak signal that occurred in May 2020,&#xD;
      after the detection of numerous cases of cutaneous leishmaniasis in military personnel&#xD;
      probably contaminated during a training course (Training Center in the Equatorial Forest,&#xD;
      CEFE) in the town of Regina. To date, around 40 cases have been detected. This outbreak&#xD;
      raises several scientific questions, on the microbiological, clinical and epidemiological&#xD;
      level.&#xD;
&#xD;
      From a microbiological point of view, it is not certain whether the occurrence of a large&#xD;
      number of cases in a given group over a short period can be attributed to a single leishmania&#xD;
      clone or only reflect exposure to a large number of infected sandflies. An L. braziliensis&#xD;
      outbreak has been described in naturalists on mission in the Saul region, but it is possible&#xD;
      that several species are detected in a larger outbreak. The description of the activities at&#xD;
      the origin of the contamination can influence the offending species insofar as the different&#xD;
      sandfly species do not use the same reservoirs, are not found in the same ecosystems and do&#xD;
      not carry the same species of leishmanias.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinically, in the case that many patients are infected after the bite of similar sandflies&#xD;
      and under similar conditions, similar clinical manifestations could be expected. It would be&#xD;
      interesting to look for variations in terms of the type, number, localization, severity of&#xD;
      lesions, and especially of response to treatment, which would reflect the role of factors&#xD;
      linked to the host and its immune response. A phylogenetic study would make it possible to&#xD;
      compare the strains isolated during this outbreak with other Guyanese isolates from the 2020&#xD;
      rainy season in order to search for a genetic cluster. A comparison can also be made between&#xD;
      the strains of the outbreak in order to find a correlation with the clinical severity of&#xD;
      certain patients or resistance to first-line treatment (Pentacarinat).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Epidemiologically, the outbreak occurred at a training site already used in previous years,&#xD;
      but without such numerous cases being reported. This site sits on 700 hectares of primary&#xD;
      forest and has not recently undergone additional development or deforestation. The course of&#xD;
      activities and the type of training carried out by the military has not changed this year. A&#xD;
      change in environmental conditions and exposure to sandflies therefore does not seem to&#xD;
      explain this increase in cases. A capture of sandflies, delayed in relation to the period of&#xD;
      contamination, would not allow the question of environmental change to be answered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the other hand, looking for behavioral risk factors (clothing, night shower, role played&#xD;
      in exercises, type of hammock used, etc.) could provide explanations for the occurrence of&#xD;
      infections in some trainees and not in their classmates. A case-control study can therefore&#xD;
      be carried out using a questionnaire offered to all course participants over the 1st semester&#xD;
      of 2020. The controls will then be participants who have not been infected. A comparison can&#xD;
      also be made between the military personnel present in French Guiana during the first half of&#xD;
      2020 and having carried out missions in the forest, by opposing the participants and&#xD;
      non-participants of the CEFE, in order to determine whether this course represented an&#xD;
      independent risk factor for leishmaniasis. This result would reflect a higher exposure than&#xD;
      conventional operations against gold mining, for example.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigation of this outbreak would make it possible to take corrective actions in terms of&#xD;
      prevention and public health. It would provide a better understanding of the&#xD;
      pathophysiological mechanism of contamination (clonal or not) and the consequences in terms&#xD;
      of infecting species, clinical severity and expected therapeutic response in the&#xD;
      circumstances of grouped cases of cutaneous leishmaniasis.&#xD;
