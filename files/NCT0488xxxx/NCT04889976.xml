    <textblock>
      Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a common mental disorder, characterized by recurrences and&#xD;
      treatment-refractoriness. Current first line treatments, antidepressants and in-person&#xD;
      cognitive-behavioral psychotherapy (CBT), are respectively associated with discontinuation&#xD;
      due to adverse events and logistical burdens. In this scenario, non-invasive brain&#xD;
      stimulation modalities, such as transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), have proven&#xD;
      to be effective, safe and tolerable alternatives for the treatment of MDD. However, while&#xD;
      tDCS in monotherapy is still not considered as effective as antidepressants, its safety,&#xD;
      tolerability and possibility of home-use are very good assets. Moreover, tDCS can be used as&#xD;
      an add-on treatment in patients with MDD who are not responding fully to antidepressants, or&#xD;
      who have low tolerability to their adverse effects. Recent pilot studies have also suggested&#xD;
      a possible combined mechanism of tDCS with CBT. Therefore, the Psylect trial aims to evaluate&#xD;
      the efficacy, safety and feasibility of home-use tDCS, combined with an app-based behavioral&#xD;
      intervention (BT), for the treatment of MDD. In this trial, the investigators will enroll 210&#xD;
      adult patients with MDD, to receive one of three possibilities: (1) active combination of&#xD;
      tDCS and BT; (2) active tDCS and sham-BT; or (3) double sham, for 6 weeks. At study entry,&#xD;
      participants will not have to discontinue their antidepressants, should they be in use of&#xD;
      them. However, the investigators will require antidepressants to remain at stable doses&#xD;
      throughout the study. This trial is double-blinded and sham-controlled in order to better&#xD;
      estimate the combined treatment effect. However, participants will be invited to receive the&#xD;
      active treatments in an open-label follow-up phase, if: (1) they received any kind of sham&#xD;
      during the double-blind phase, and (2) remain clinically depressed at endpoint. Before trial&#xD;
      initiation, eligible participants will receive proper in-person training on how to operate&#xD;
      the home-use tDCS device (Flow, Flow Neuroscience, Sweden), and how to connect it, via&#xD;
      bluetooth, to the BT-app (Flow Depression). Furthermore, throughout the trial, participants&#xD;
      will have remote access to our research team for guidance and management of adverse events.&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that the combined treatment will be more effective in improving&#xD;
      depressive symptoms, compared to tDCS-only or double-sham, while being safe, tolerable and&#xD;
      fit for home-use.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a very prevalent, debilitating and chronic mental&#xD;
      disorder, characterized by frequent recurrences and resistance to first-line treatments:&#xD;
      antidepressants and in-person cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT). Furthermore,&#xD;
      antidepressants are associated with high discontinuation rates due to adverse effects, and&#xD;
      CBT might not be readily available due to logistical burdens and/or financial restrictions.&#xD;
      Non-invasive brain stimulation techniques (NIBS), such as repetitive transcranial magnetic&#xD;
      stimulation (rTMS) and transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), are considered safe&#xD;
      and tolerable interventions for MDD. While rTMS is already approved by the FDA for MDD, it&#xD;
      involves daily visits to research/treatment centers and is costly. TDCS, on the other hand,&#xD;
      albeit having failed to prove non-inferiority in monotherapy to a conventional antidepressant&#xD;
      (escitalopram oxalate) in a previous randomized, controlled clinical trial, is less expensive&#xD;
      than rTMS, and portable. Therefore, tDCS could be suitable for home-use under remote&#xD;
      supervision by trained clinical staff, especially as add-on intervention for MDD. In this&#xD;
      scenario, recent pilot trials have suggested a possible combined effect of tDCS with&#xD;
      psychological interventions, based on a mechanism known as &quot;functional targeting&quot;, that is,&#xD;
      using two or more interventions to engage the same brain area of interest.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Psylect study is a parallel, 3-arm, randomized, double-blind, placebo(sham)-controlled,&#xD;
      single-center clinical trial, devised to assess the efficacy, tolerability, safety and&#xD;
      feasibility of: (1) home-use transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), a non-invasive&#xD;
      brain stimulation technique, combined with (2) an app-based behavioral therapy program (BT),&#xD;
      for the treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will enroll 210 adult patients diagnosed with MDD per DSM-5 criteria,&#xD;
      regardless of being in treatment with conventional antidepressants, to receive either: (1)&#xD;
      the active combination of tDCS+BT (&quot;double active&quot;), (2) active tDCS + sham BT (&quot;tDCS-only&quot;),&#xD;
      or (3) sham tDCS+ sham BT (&quot;double sham&quot;), during 6 weeks. The use of sham (placebo) is&#xD;
      necessary in order to better estimate the combined active treatment effect, but patients will&#xD;
      be invited to receive the active treatments in an open-label follow-up phase, if they were&#xD;
      previously randomized to receive any kind of sham during the double-blind phase. Our study&#xD;
      has received approval by the Ethics Committee of the University of Sao Paulo, in accordance&#xD;
      with the Declaration of Helsinki guidelines. Prior to enrollment, participants and&#xD;
      researchers will receive and jointly sign an informed consent document.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators' main hypothesis is that the antidepressant efficacy of the combined active&#xD;
      treatments will be superior to &quot;tDCS-only&quot; or &quot;double-sham&quot;, at the 6-week endpoint. The&#xD;
      investigators also hypothesize, in line with previous clinical trials conducted by their&#xD;
      team, that tDCS will continue to prove a safe and tolerable intervention, and in this case,&#xD;
      also fit for home-use. Prior to performing home-based sessions, participants will receive&#xD;
      proper in-person training with the tDCS device and smartphone app, and from then on, will&#xD;
      have remote access to the investigators through a phone line and email for questions and&#xD;
      management of adverse events. Upon initial remote contact, participants will be properly&#xD;
      directed to the research institution's clinical facilities (including the emergency&#xD;
      department), in case of clinical and/or psychiatric adverse events which are deemed to need&#xD;
      in-person evaluation and follow-up. The aforementioned clinical facilities are situated at&#xD;
      the Clinics and University Hospitals of the University of Sao Paulo, Brazil, which are,&#xD;
      respectively, tertiary and secondary care centers, and reference public hospitals in the Sao&#xD;
      Paulo city area.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The tDCS device used in this trial is manufactured by Flow Neuroscience (Malmö, Sweden), and&#xD;
      consists of a one-size-fits-all headset with circular electrodes, with the anode positioned&#xD;
      over the left prefrontal cortex and the cathode over the right prefrontal cortex. The device&#xD;
      comes with a set of sealed, saline-humidified disposable sponges, an electrical charger, and&#xD;
      has pre-set and fixed stimulation parameters. This device has been previously tested by the&#xD;
      investigators in a computer-modeling procedure, with simulations displaying adequate&#xD;
      electrical field strength and distribution in prefrontal brain areas of interest (ie,&#xD;
      dorsolateral prefrontal cortex). Furthermore, the Flow device has been approved in the UK and&#xD;
      European Union for home-use in patients with MDD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The active stimulation parameters in this trial consist of a 2mA current (current density&#xD;
      0,09mA/cm2), delivered for 30-minutes, over 5 workdays in a row for the first 3 weeks,&#xD;
      followed by twice-weekly sessions for the following 3 weeks (total of 21 sessions during 6&#xD;
      weeks). The anode is positioned over the left prefrontal cortex and the cathode, over the&#xD;
      right prefrontal cortex. The sham tDCS session consists of a fade-in and fade-out phase of&#xD;
      1mA for 45 seconds, with a silent period in-between for the remaining 28 1/2 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The active BT app consists of interactive sessions, conducted by an avatar-therapist, over&#xD;
      areas such as: behavioral activation, meditation, physical exercise, healthy dietary habits&#xD;
      and sleep hygiene. Sham BT sessions in this trial will consist of access to free internet&#xD;
      websites, after logging in the app.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators' team will consist of 2 separate groups: (1) session supervisors, who will&#xD;
      offer an initial in-person training session to participants and will be available remotely&#xD;
      for supervised guidance for the following home-based sessions (unblinded); (2) clinical&#xD;
      evaluators, who will evaluate participants weekly until study endpoint, through remote video&#xD;
      conferences, while being able to refer patients to in-person evaluation to the research&#xD;
      center, as deemed necessary (blinded).&#xD;
&#xD;
      For data collection, the investigators will use REDCap (Research Electronic Data Capture),&#xD;
      created at Vanderbilt University (Tennessee, USA) with NIH support. RedCap is a free-source&#xD;
      software, that works in offline and online modes and runs on tablets, smartphones and&#xD;
      computers, and was designed to build and manage online surveys and databases, replacing paper&#xD;
      notebooks. It also has tools that allow dynamic data management and data quality examination.&#xD;
      REDCap can be installed in a variety of environments for compliance with such standards as&#xD;
      HIPAA, 21 CFR Part 11, FISMA (low, moderate, high), and international standards. The Medical&#xD;
      School of the University of Sao Paulo (FMUSP), the PI host institution, has a RedCap&#xD;
      community that provides support and feedback on its use. Data can be exported from REDCap to&#xD;
      several file formats, including .csv (Excel, R) and .dta (Stata). Periodically, the data will&#xD;
      be exported and saved offline in password-protected external HDs and flash drives. REDCap&#xD;
      access will be restricted using individual usernames and passwords. No user will have&#xD;
      permission to modify or export the data (except for generating security copies) during the&#xD;
      trial. If data edition is necessary (e.g., incorrect input), a new data version will be&#xD;
      generated. All changes in the data will be reported.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For data management and quality control, the investigators will hire an information&#xD;
      technology (IT) specialist for technical support in the project. Data will be coded according&#xD;
      to a previously developed data dictionary. Quality of data collection will be monitored by&#xD;
      random data quality checks for consistency (e.g., depression scores compatible in different&#xD;
      scales) and completeness (absence or few cases of missing data). The investigators will also&#xD;
      have access to an online dashboard, that remotely monitors participant adherence to study&#xD;
      protocol. If unblinding is necessary, the PI holds special codes for the procedure, while&#xD;
      having to specify the reason for unblinding, which are: an increase ≥ 25% from baseline&#xD;
      scores on the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale-HDRS (17-item version) on 2 consecutive&#xD;
      clinical evaluations, development of suicidal ideation, serious clinical and psychiatric&#xD;
      adverse events, development of hypo(mania) and/or psychotic symptoms, low adherence (missing&#xD;
      2 clinical evaluations or failing to comply with at least 75% of tDCS sessions at home) or&#xD;
      patient consent withdrawal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For sample size calculation, the investigators based the parameters on previous clinical&#xD;
      trials involving tDCS in MDD, and assumed baseline depression scores and standard deviation&#xD;
      (SD) of 25 (± 5) on the HDRS-17, distributed equally between groups. Sham (placebo) effect&#xD;
      would impact baseline depression scores in one effect size (ES) in SD units (ES = difference&#xD;
      in mean change divided by SD). The investigators estimate tDCS monotherapy to have a response&#xD;
      of ES = 0.4 when compared to sham, and the combination of tDCS and BT to have a larger&#xD;
      response of ES = 0.8 when compared to sham. Therefore, endpoint scores of 20, 18 and 16 were&#xD;
      used. Total sample size (N) was determined to adequately power (1-β = 0.8) statistical tests&#xD;
      for differences in change over 4 measurements (continuous linear change) between treatment&#xD;
      arms (time x group interaction) in the framework of linear hierarchical models (LMM).&#xD;
      Following CONSORT-guideline extensions for the planning of multi-arm parallel-group&#xD;
      randomized trials, power was not calculated for a global test of significance (e.g. global&#xD;
      F-test), but for all combinations of planned pairwise comparisons (sham vs. tDCS; sham vs.&#xD;
      tDCS + BT; tDCS vs. tDCS + BT). Sample size per arm was calculated based on the smallest&#xD;
      detectable group difference (ES tDCS vs. combination = -0.4, ES sham vs. tDCS = -0.4).&#xD;
      Significance levels were Bonferroni corrected for 3-way pairwise comparisons (α = 0.05/3) to&#xD;
      control family-wise error rate, while still allowing for more anti-conservative adjustment in&#xD;
      the final analysis. Dropouts were assumed to be monotonically increasing (Weibull) and&#xD;
      equally distributed between treatment arms. The investigators obtained a total N of 210&#xD;
      participants, assuming a 10% attrition rate (therefore, 70 persons per arm).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Results will be considered statistically significant if a two-sided p&lt;0.05 is obtained. For&#xD;
      the primary outcome, the investigators will recur to linear hierarchical model analysis,&#xD;
      using a first order regressive covariance structure, which includes all observed variables&#xD;
      without the need of inputting missing data. The dependent variable is HDRS-17; independent&#xD;
      variables are time (all observations until week 6) and group (double active, tDCS-only and&#xD;
      double sham). The investigators will test the statistical significance between the slopes of&#xD;
      double active vs. tDCS-only, per the primary hypothesis. For the secondary continuous&#xD;
      outcomes, the same linear hierarchical models will be used. Binary outcomes will be modeled&#xD;
      using mixed logistic regression at each time point. Response and remission are respectively&#xD;
      defined as a clinical improvement of symptoms ≥ 50% (response) and a HDRS-17 score ≤&#xD;
      (remission). The investigators will evaluate predictors of response, as exploratory outcomes,&#xD;
      by testing the interaction of each predictor with group. Improvement in other depressive&#xD;
      domains will be evaluated using the same linear hierarchical models described.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Missing data will be handled using an intention-to-treat (ITT) approach.&#xD;
