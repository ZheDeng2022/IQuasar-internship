  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Object: Postherpetic neuralgia (PHN) is pain that persists for 1-3 months after herpes zoster&#xD;
      onset. It is the most common complication of herpes zoster and occurs in 15-40% of patients&#xD;
      with herpes zoster. PHN has been suggested to be related with the lesion of doral root&#xD;
      ganglion (DRG). However, the studies are almost limited to autopsies and animals , and the&#xD;
      mechanism of PHN is still unclear. This study was conducted to investigate morphological and&#xD;
      metabolic changes of DRG and sympathetic ganglion in patients with postherpetic neuralgia on&#xD;
      MRI. Method: 30 patients diagnosed as PHN were recruited. The volume and fractional&#xD;
      anisotropy of DRG of lesion dermatomes were measured under MRI, and compared with&#xD;
      contralateral and adjacent DRG. The volume and fractional anisotropy of sympathetic ganglion&#xD;
      of lesion dermatomes were also measured under MRI, and compared with contralateral and&#xD;
      adjacent sympathetic ganglion.Then, the association between clinical phenotypes and DRG&#xD;
      changes were analyzed.&#xD;

      Patients with the following conditions were excluded: psychiatric diseases or communication&#xD;
      disorders; contraindications to MRI;DRG radiofrequency therapy, spinal cord electrical&#xD;
      stimulation and other direct intervention treatments for DRG were performed before&#xD;
      examination.&#xD;
