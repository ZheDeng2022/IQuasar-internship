  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Early and accurate recognition of gastrointestinal lesions has implications for public&#xD;
      health. The quality of oesophagogastroduodenoscopy (OGD) has great impact on the detection of&#xD;
      oesophageal and gastric malignancies. An AI system, Cerebro, has been developed as a&#xD;
      real-time recognition of a pre-defined 28 locations. This system would alert the endoscopist&#xD;
      if the sites were not inspected with adequate time. The aim of the study is to investigate&#xD;
      the use of AI in endoscopists-in-training during OGD to provide a real-time feedback for&#xD;
      ensuring compliance to a standardized protocol for examination. The hypothesis is that the&#xD;
      use of AI system Cerebro will significantly improve the compliance to the protocol and&#xD;
      thereby reduce the blind spot rates of OGD, ensure adequate inspection time and ensure&#xD;
      adequate photodocumentation.&#xD;

&#xD;
          4. Patients with altered anatomy such as history of esophagectomy, gastrectomy, gastric&#xD;
             bypass surgery, or Whipple's operation,&#xD;
