  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A novel zoonotic coronavirus was discovered in Wuhan (Hubei Province, China) mid-December&#xD;
      2019 and was named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The virus&#xD;
      rapidly spread to the rest of the world, including Europe and explicitly affects the&#xD;
      respiratory system, generating Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is a monocentric interventional prospective and retrospective cohort study. After&#xD;
      signing a written informed consent, participants will be recruited for questionnaire&#xD;
      completion and blood sampling. Sample storage and analysis will be performed at the&#xD;
      laboratory of microbiology of the UZ Brussel.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To document SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence and seroconversion among employees of the UZ Brussel&#xD;
      after mRNA vaccination for SARS-CoV-2, namely at 8 weeks after first vaccination, 6 months&#xD;
      after first vaccination and 12 months after first vaccination.&#xD;

      A novel zoonotic coronavirus was discovered in Wuhan (Hubei Province, China) mid-December&#xD;
      2019 and was named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The virus&#xD;
      rapidly spread to the rest of the world, including Europe and explicitly affects the&#xD;
      respiratory system, generating Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).&#xD;
&#xD;
      UZ Brussel employees presenting symptoms suggestive of COVID-19 are offered to be tested with&#xD;
      real-time PCR on nasopharyngeal swabs. As asymptomatic infections have been described and as&#xD;
      the PCR can be negative when taken late after onset of symptoms, serologic tests can be&#xD;
      performed. The SARS-CoV 2003 epidemic demonstrated that serological assays were a useful&#xD;
      diagnostic tool of non-acute infections. Although it is still uncertain whether convalescing&#xD;
      patients have a risk of re-infection, recent data suggest that SARS-CoV-2 antibodies could&#xD;
      protect at least for some time from subsequent viral exposures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As the COVID-19 pandemic had devastating medical, economic and social consequences, safe and&#xD;
      effective prophylactic vaccines were urgently needed. And thus several candidate vaccines&#xD;
      against SARS-CoV-2 have been developed. During the first weeks of the vaccination campaign,&#xD;
      the health care workers of the UZ Brussel, were invited to receive the BNT162b2 (Pfizer)&#xD;
      vaccine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Consequently, the investigators aim to prospectively document the SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence&#xD;
      and seroconversion among vaccinated employees of the UZ Brussel, at three different time&#xD;
      points, namely 6 weeks (+/- 2 weeks; T1), 6 months (+/- 1 month; T2) and 12 months (+/- 1&#xD;
      month; T3) after the second vaccination.&#xD;
