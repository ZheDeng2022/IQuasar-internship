  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Current data estimated that 451 million people, (age 18-99 years) suffered from diabetes&#xD;
      world wide in 2017, and are expected to rise to 693 million by 2045. Among them, type 2&#xD;
      diabetes mellitus (T2DM) accounts for around 90% of all cases with diabetes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      T2DM is associated with several deterimental microvascular and macrovascular complications&#xD;
      (Annani-Akollor ME et al ., 2019) . As such, effective management of the disease is crucial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The American Diabetes Association (ADA) and the European Association for the Study of&#xD;
      Diabetes (EASD) recommend metformin as the first therapeutic choice for T2DM management with&#xD;
      concurrent lifestyle modifications. Reports indicated that metformin improves peripheral&#xD;
      insulin sensitivity and reduces the risk of cardiovascular mortality in T2DM in addition to&#xD;
      its beneficial effects on weight loss and vascular protection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nonetheless, as with most medications, metformin has some side effects. Though most of these&#xD;
      side effects are mild, reports indicated that metformin use is associated with diminution of&#xD;
      vitamin B12 level . Also, advanced age of patients with T2DM, nutritional deficiency, and&#xD;
      malabsorption are other contributing factors for its deficiency .&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed mechanisms for deficiency include, impairment of calcium dependent absorption&#xD;
      from the gut, alteration in small bowel motility resulting in bacterial overgrowth, and a&#xD;
      reduction in intrinsic factor levels .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Metformin-induced vitamin B12 deficiency has also been associated with neuropathy. The&#xD;
      neuropathy associated with vitamin B12 deficiency ranges from paresthesia and attenuated&#xD;
      peripheral sensation in response to changes in mental status and proprioception which overlap&#xD;
      with diabetic neuropathy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The progression of vitamin B12 deficiency-induced neurologic damage can, however, be abated&#xD;
      through early detection and vitamin B12 therapy. Nonetheless, if peripheral neuropathy due to&#xD;
      deficiency of vitamin B12 is misconstrued as diabetic peripheral neuropathy , permanent&#xD;
      neurological damage may occur.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several studies have investigated the individual effects of the dose and duration of&#xD;
      metformin therapy on vitamin B12 levels .The reported results are inconsistent, with some&#xD;
      studies reporting an association with the dose but not the duration and other studies&#xD;
      reporting an association only for the duration. however, A few studies did not find an&#xD;
      association with either the dose or the duration..&#xD;
&#xD;
      This could be attributed to the fact that, in any given patient with T2DM, vitamin B12 levels&#xD;
      could be influenced predominantly by either the dose or the duration of metformin therapy.&#xD;
      Hence, it is important to involve both the dose and duration of metformin therapy into the&#xD;
      assessment of vitamin B12 deficiency.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Micronutrient deficiencies constitute a global health issue, particularly among countries in&#xD;
      the Middle East .The World Health Organization (WHO) has divided this region into overlapping&#xD;
      country clusters with regard to nutrition stages and dominant nutrition problems, including&#xD;
      major risk factors and underlying causes, program interventions, and gaps in response to&#xD;
      these problems.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Countries in early nutrition transition (e.g., Egypt, Jordan, Lebanon, Morocco, and&#xD;
      Palestine) are typically characterized by a moderate prevalence of overweight and obesity,&#xD;
      moderate levels of undernutrition in specific population groups, and widespread micronutrient&#xD;
      deficiencies/inadequacies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Metformin Usage Index is the product of the dose of metformin (mg) used and its duration&#xD;
      divided by 1000. An index which incorporates both of these factors would not only be useful&#xD;
      to understand the cumulative impact on vitamin B12 levels but also provide an objective&#xD;
      threshold for initiating vitamin B12 supplementation .&#xD;
&#xD;
      So , the aim of this study is to assess the relationship between the dose and duration of&#xD;
      metformin therapy with vitamin B12 levels using the &quot;Metformin Usage Index&quot; (MUI) in Egyptian&#xD;
      type 2 diabetic patients where the incidence of nutritional deficiencies are not uncommom in&#xD;
      order to formulate their appropriate management strategies .&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of our study is to evaluate the combined effect of both dose and duration of&#xD;
      metformin therapy on vitamin B12 levels in Egyptian patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus&#xD;
      (T2D).&#xD;
