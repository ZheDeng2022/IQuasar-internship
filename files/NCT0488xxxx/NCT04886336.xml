  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to compare the BW and metabolic profiles of CHB patient before and&#xD;
      after shifting to TAF therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, investigators will enroll 100 entecavir and 100 TDF treated CHB patients who&#xD;
      will switch to TAF and then follow for one year. Demographic, liver function tests, sugar&#xD;
      profiles, lipid profiles, ASCVD risk score, body weight, body weight, body height, and waist&#xD;
      circumference will be checked and recorded periodically.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators anticipated that body weight will change significantly after switching to TAF&#xD;
      in both entecavir and TDF group and may associated with increased risk of cardiovascular&#xD;
      risk.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Currently, three oral nucleoside/tides analogues (NUC), including entecavir(ETV), tenofovir&#xD;
      disoproxil fumarate (TDF), and tenofovir alafenamide (TAF), are available as the first line&#xD;
      of treatment option for chronic hepatitis B (CHB) in Taiwan. Among them, TDF exhibits a&#xD;
      greater decline of cholesterol, High-density lipoprotein(HDL), and low-density lipoprotein&#xD;
      (LDL) levels than entecavir, while the impact of such general lipid-lowering effects on the&#xD;
      risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular diseases (ASCVD) remains unclear. For metabolic&#xD;
      features, the evidence comes from HIV patients treated with TDF or TAF containing&#xD;
      anti-retroviral therapy (ART). In one study revealed that a 0.45 kg/m2 increase of body mass&#xD;
      index (BMI) and a 13% of increase in ASCVD risk score after switching from TDF-containing to&#xD;
      TAF-containing ART. Weight gain after starting ART has been reported to associate with lower&#xD;
      mortality in initial under-weight or normal-weight HIV patients. However, a study compared&#xD;
      the efficacy and safety of dolutegravir/TAF/emtricitabine, dolutegravir/TDF/emtricitabine,&#xD;
      and EFV/TDF/emtricitabine and revealed that patients receiving TAF and TDF containing&#xD;
      regimens significantly increased body weight. The subsequent body composition analysis showed&#xD;
      weight gain mainly resulted from increased lean muscle and fat of trunk and limb. A previous&#xD;
      study also showed that the ART-associated increase in muscle area, regardless of regimen, is&#xD;
      likely a reflection of increased fat within the muscle that may associate with weakness of&#xD;
      muscle strength, risk of fall, and a decline of physical activities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Overall, in HIV-infected patients, TAF-containing regimens had been shown to increase body&#xD;
      weight resulting from increased fat and muscle of trunk and limb. However, it remains unknown&#xD;
      whether all these findings in HIV infected patients could be similarly observed in CHB&#xD;
      patient receiving TAF therapy, which is commonly encountered in Asia-Pacific region.&#xD;
      Moreover, the mechanisms underlying these changes are still unclear. The long-term clinical&#xD;
      impact of the BW gain and associated metabolic derangement is also unknown.&#xD;
