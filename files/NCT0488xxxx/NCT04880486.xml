      Using weight training with virtual reality can help after discharge patients of acute&#xD;
      exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, which maintained their quality of&#xD;
      life, and improved their exercise capacity, pulmonary function, readmission condition.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a type obstructive lung disease which had&#xD;
      become the third leading cause of deaths worldwide. The main symptoms including dyspnea,&#xD;
      coughing, sputum production and acute exacerbation of COPD (AECOPD). The physical activity&#xD;
      level, muscle power, exercise tolerance and quality of life (QoL) would decline rapidly when&#xD;
      an episode of AECOPD occurred, with the worsen of the pulmonary function and activities&#xD;
      level, the patient would get weaker and mortality rate would increase. Pulmonary&#xD;
      rehabilitation (PR) had become a common-used clinical programs which including (but not limit&#xD;
      to) medication, education, psychological support, nutrition consultation and exercise&#xD;
      interventions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In PR programs, exercise had been specifically pointed out for its improvement of physical&#xD;
      activity level and quality of life, however, the adherence rate of programs remains low due&#xD;
      to lack of motivation and insufficient training effect. Previous interventions preferred&#xD;
      aerobic exercise conducting in sitting position considering the long-term sedentary life&#xD;
      style of patients. However, such an intervention demonstrated little effect on increasing&#xD;
      muscle power of lower extremities, results in insufficient physical activity level and&#xD;
      functional performance. Besides, the interventions are usually single and repeatedly limb&#xD;
      movement exercise which fail to brings up interests and results in poor motivation of the&#xD;
      patients. Literatures review has suggested the highly involvement of upper extremities which&#xD;
      is strongly contributed to independently daily living. The implantation of virtual reality in&#xD;
      PR program has gained attentions with its advantage of facilitate the motivation. Therefore,&#xD;
      the study aims to conduct the muscle strength training including both upper and lower&#xD;
      extremities with the combination of virtual reality (VR). Anticipated result expects to&#xD;
      provide a research evidence of innovative pulmonary rehabilitation exercise intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will recruited 30 participants who will be randomly divided into control and&#xD;
      intervention group. Control group will receive routine pulmonary rehabilitation including&#xD;
      medication and education, the research stuff will give a brief explanation of home exercise,&#xD;
      and weekly telemedicine to follow the exercise intensity and provide conciliation.&#xD;
      Intervention group will receive the routine medical care. Extra weight training program&#xD;
      targeting on upper extremities with the VR headsets will be conducted with the accompany of&#xD;
      the research stuff. 3 times a week for 8 weeks (as a 24-times interference totally)&#xD;
      interventions with muscle strength, exercise capacity, pulmonary function and improvement of&#xD;
      quality of life will be assess to investigate the training effects. Expected result including&#xD;
      the progression of muscle strength, oxygen uptake level, as well as pulmonary performance.&#xD;
      The implantation of VR will also improve the motivation to participant, which will further&#xD;
      alleviate the symptoms and quality of life. It can also provide some research evidence for&#xD;
      clinical therapist to conduct an individualized exercise prescription for COPD.&#xD;
