  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research is being done to find out if an investigational drug, Nivolumab, can be safely&#xD;
      administered after a &quot;half-matched&quot; (haplo) bone marrow transplant (BMT), and if the&#xD;
      investigational drug will help to prevent or delay relapse or progression of sarcomas. In&#xD;
      this study investigators will also be trying to learn more about how the investigational drug&#xD;
      changes blood and/or tumors. Participants are eligible for this trial if they have recently&#xD;
      undergone a &quot;half-matched&quot; (haplo) bone marrow transplant and have either relapsed or are at&#xD;
      high risk to relapse.&#xD;

      High risk, recurrent, or refractory solid tumors in pediatric, adolescent and young adult&#xD;
      (AYA) patients have an extremely poor prognosis despite current intensive treatment regimens.&#xD;
      Johns Hopkins piloted an allogeneic bone marrow transplant (alloBMT) platform using a reduced&#xD;
      intensity conditioning (RIC) and partially HLA-mismatched (haploidentical) related donors for&#xD;
      this population of pediatric and AYA solid tumor patients.With this strategy, investigators&#xD;
      demonstrated that RIC haploBMT with post-transplant cyclophosphamide (PTCy) is feasible and&#xD;
      has acceptable toxicities in patients with incurable pediatric and AYA solid tumors; thus,&#xD;
      this approach serves as a platform for post-transplant strategies to prevent relapse and&#xD;
      optimize progression free survival. In this trial, the central hypothesis is that the&#xD;
      efficacy of alloBMT for high risk solid tumors can be improved by developing methods to&#xD;
      augment donor T cell responses against antigens selectively or uniquely expressed by tumor&#xD;
      tissue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators aim to demonstrated that Programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-1) blockade with&#xD;
      nivolumab will be safe and well tolerated after RIC haplo BMT, initially in a relapsed&#xD;
      population (Part A) and ultimately when given pre-emptively (Part B).&#xD;

&#xD;
          2. Patients with histologically confirmed solid tumors with an estimated poor long term&#xD;
             survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Performance Level: Karnofsky ≥ 50% for patients &gt; 16 years of age and Lansky ≥ 60 for&#xD;
             patients ≤16 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Patients must be post RIC haploidentical BMT.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Patients must have fully recovered from the acute toxic effects of prior BMT.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Concomitant radiation therapy can be administered in the setting of this trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Subjects must consent to allow for a baseline tumor biopsy. If a biopsy is not&#xD;
             feasible, then archival tumor material must be made available. Tumor biopsies to be&#xD;
             taken (if a subject's tumor is thought to be reasonably safe and easy to biopsy) at&#xD;
             baseline (any time prior to the first dose after eligibility is met) and at Cycle 2&#xD;
             (4-6 cores per time point) or when lesions are visualized on physical examination or&#xD;
             imaging studies in the case of no identifiable masses at cycle 2. Additional optional&#xD;
             biopsies may be obtained later in the course of study treatment. The proposed&#xD;
             investigation is considered a non-significant risk (NSR). A significant risk procedure&#xD;
             is generally considered to be one for which the procedure-associated absolute risk of&#xD;
             mortality or major morbidity, in the patient's clinical setting and at the institution&#xD;
             completing the procedure, is 2% or higher. Diagnostic Tissue Samples Tissue, fluid, or&#xD;
             blood may be collected from standard of care procedures used to treat or diagnose&#xD;
             immune related toxicities/GVHD.&#xD;
