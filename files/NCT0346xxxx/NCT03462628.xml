      The primary objective of this investigation is to compare the efficacy of two different AF&#xD;
      ablation strategies in older patients with paroxysmal AF: Pulmonary vein isolation alone&#xD;
      versus additional low-voltage substrate modification during sinus rhythm&#xD;

      BACKGROUND: Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common cardiac rhythm disorder. Catheter&#xD;
      ablation to the pulmonary veins isolation (PVI) electrically from the left atrium (LA) has&#xD;
      been shown to be an effective treatment for paroxysmal AF (PAF). The consensus is that PVI&#xD;
      alone is the main strategy for PAF ablation. Based on the results from our pilot study and&#xD;
      STABLE-SR trial, that low-voltage modification beyond CPVI is very promising for persistent&#xD;
      AF ablation. Whether the low voltage area modification combined with PVI improves outcomes is&#xD;
      unclear in older patients with PAF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AIM OF THE STUDY: The primary objective of this investigation is to compare the efficacy of&#xD;
      two different AF ablation strategies in older patients with PAF: PVI alone versus additional&#xD;
      low-voltage substrate modification during sinus rhythm. The primary endpoint is freedom from&#xD;
      AF and/or ATs with or without antiarrhythmic drugs (AADs) at 12 months after a&#xD;
      single-ablation procedure. AF and/or AT occurring in the first 3 months after the ablation&#xD;
      (blanking period) was censored. Each atrial tachyarrhythmia episode lasts &gt; 30 seconds&#xD;
      monitored by ECG, 24-Holter or 7 days-Holter was defined as recurrence. The secondary&#xD;
      endpoint are incidence of periprocedural complications, including stroke, PV stenosis,&#xD;
      cardiac perforation, esophageal injury and death; procedure time; fluoroscopy time (including&#xD;
      the total fluoroscopy time, during CPVI and after CPVI); the occurrence of the conversion&#xD;
      from AF to AT, and its relationship with long-term outcome; the scar distribution and the&#xD;
      relationship of success rate in older PAF patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY DESIGN: This is a randomized, prospective, parallel, single-blind multicenter design.&#xD;
      The expected freedom from atrial fibrillation in older patients after one ablation procedure&#xD;
      was 75% for PVI. Previous study did not include a group assigned to isolation plus additional&#xD;
      low-voltage substrate modification during sinus rhythm, so freedom form AF for this procedure&#xD;
      was estimated from the literature at 85%. A log-rank test was used for sample-size&#xD;
      calculation. To test whether the isolation plus low-voltage substrate modification was&#xD;
      superior to isolation only. Then the 369 patients were needed, with a randomization ratio of&#xD;
      1:1, for the study to have a power of 90% at a two-sided alpha level of 0.05. Assuming a&#xD;
      dropout rate of 15%, we need 434 patients. Patients are randomized in a 1:1 fashion into one&#xD;
      of the investigation arms: CPVI plus low-voltage substrate modification in the left atrium&#xD;
      during SR and CPVI alone. Follow-up for these patients includes visits at 3 m, 6 m, 9 m, 12&#xD;
      m.&#xD;
