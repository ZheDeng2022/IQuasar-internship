  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      When a limb is amputated, pain perceived in the part of the body that no longer exists often&#xD;
      develops, called &quot;phantom limb&quot; pain. The exact reason that phantom limb pain occurs is&#xD;
      unclear, but when a nerve is cut-as happens with an amputation-changes occur in the brain and&#xD;
      spinal cord that are associated with persistent pain. The negative feedback-loop between the&#xD;
      injured limb and the brain can be stopped by putting local anesthetic-called a &quot;nerve&#xD;
      block&quot;-on the injured nerve, effectively keeping any &quot;bad signals&quot; from reaching the brain. A&#xD;
      &quot;continuous peripheral nerve block&quot; (CPNB) is a technique providing pain relief that involves&#xD;
      inserting a tiny tube-smaller than a piece of spaghetti-through the skin and next to the&#xD;
      target nerve. Local anesthetic is then introduced through the tiny tube, which bathes the&#xD;
      nerve in the numbing medicine. This provides a multiple-day block that provides opioid-free&#xD;
      pain control with no systemic side effects, and may prevent the destructive feedback loop&#xD;
      that results in phantom limb pain following an amputation. We propose a multicenter,&#xD;
      randomized, triple-masked (investigators, subjects, statisticians), placebo-controlled,&#xD;
      parallel arm, human-subjects clinical trial to determine if a prolonged, high-concentration&#xD;
      (dense), perioperative CPNB improves post-amputation physical and emotional functioning while&#xD;
      decreasing opioid consumption, primarily by preventing chronic phantom limb pain.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Subjects will receive 2 perineural catheters: a femoral and sciatic. With a high-frequency&#xD;
      linear array ultrasound transducer, the target nerves will be identified in a transverse&#xD;
      cross-sectional view: the sciatic nerve proximal to the anticipated level of amputation and&#xD;
      the femoral nerve at the inguinal crease. For each insertion, normal saline will be injected&#xD;
      via the needle to open the perineural space allowing subsequent insertion of a perineural&#xD;
      catheter 3-5 cm beyond the needle tip. The needle will be removed over the catheter, and the&#xD;
      catheter affixed to the skin and covered with occlusive dressings. Local anesthetic (20 mL,&#xD;
      lidocaine 2% with epinephrine 2.5 µg/ml) will be injected via each catheter.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The nerve blocks will be evaluated 20 minutes following local anesthetic injection and the&#xD;
      catheter insertions considered successful when subjects have a decreased sensation to cold&#xD;
      temperature (alcohol swabs) in the appropriate cutaneous distribution for each target nerve.&#xD;
      Catheters may be re-bolused with lidocaine 2% with epinephrine 2.5 µg/ml, at the discretion&#xD;
      of the Site Director.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment group assignment (randomization). Subjects will be randomized to one of two groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Experimental: bupivacaine 0.3% (or ropivacaine 0.5%) for a total of 7 days&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Control: bupivacaine 0.1% (or ropivacaine 0.2%) for 1 day followed by normal saline for&#xD;
           6 additional days&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization will be stratified by institution in randomly chosen block sizes of 2 or 4.&#xD;
      Investigational pharmacists at each institution will prepare all study solutions as&#xD;
      determined by the randomization lists. Unmasking will not occur until statistical analysis is&#xD;
      complete (termed &quot;triple masking&quot;).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to the perineural infusions, subjects will receive standard-of-care oral and&#xD;
      intravenous postoperative analgesics. The perineural infusions will be initiated within the&#xD;
      operating or recovery room. The continuous basal infusion rate for lower extremity catheters&#xD;
      will be determined by amputation location: below-knee [femoral 3 mL/h; sciatic 5 mL/h] and&#xD;
      above-knee [femoral 5 mL/h; sciatic 3 mL/h]. No patient-controlled bolus dose will be&#xD;
      included.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The morning of postoperative day 1, the local anesthetic reservoirs will be replaced with new&#xD;
      reservoirs containing study infusate: additional bupivacaine 0.3% for the Experimental group&#xD;
      [alternative: ropivacaine 0.5%]; normal saline for the Control Group. Subjects will be&#xD;
      discharged home with portable infusion pumps when medically ready, without restriction due to&#xD;
      study participation and telephoned daily. If premature dislodgement occurs prior to 72 hours,&#xD;
      the subject may opt to have the catheter replaced as soon as can be arranged with the&#xD;
      investigators (a minimum of 72 hours will be considered a successful treatment application).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Seven days following catheter insertion, subjects or their caretakers will remove the&#xD;
      perineural catheters with instructions given by an investigator via telephone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome measurements (end points). The primary end point will be mobility at 9 months&#xD;
      following surgery (measured with the Locomotor Capabilities Index). The primary analyses will&#xD;
      compare the two treatment groups. End points will be evaluated at baseline (postoperative day&#xD;
      0), during the initial infusion of either bupivacaine 0.3% or 0.1% [alternative: ropivacaine&#xD;
      0.5% or 0.2%] (morning of postoperative day 1); during the second infusion of either&#xD;
      bupivacaine 0.3% [alternative: ropivacaine 0.5%] or placebo (postoperative day 2), following&#xD;
      the completion of the infusion (postoperative day 8), and the follow-up period (postoperative&#xD;
      months 1, 3, 6, 9, and 12).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The questionnaires will differentiate among multiple dimensions of limb pain:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Residual limb (&quot;stump&quot;) pain: painful sensations localized to the portion of limb still&#xD;
      physically present Phantom limb sensations: non-painful sensations referred to the lost body&#xD;
      part Phantom limb pain: painful sensations referred to the lost body part&#xD;
&#xD;
      Medical history will include the indication for amputation, history of the surgical limb&#xD;
      (e.g. previous surgeries), preoperative limb pain levels (e.g., least, average, worst and&#xD;
      current), comorbidities, medications, and amputation level. In addition, we will apply the&#xD;
      PTSD Checklist (PCL-C) at baseline.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 1: Mobility will be significantly increased within the 12 months following a&#xD;
      surgical amputation with a 7-day high-concentration perioperative CPNB compared with usual&#xD;
      and customary analgesia (as measured with the Locomotor Capabilities Index-5). The primary&#xD;
      outcome measure of the proposed trial will occur at the 9 month time point.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 2: General physical and emotional disability will be significantly lower within&#xD;
      the 12 months following a surgical amputation with a 7-day high-concentration perioperative&#xD;
      CPNB compared with usual and customary analgesia (as measured with the World Health&#xD;
      Organization Disability Assessment Schedule 2.0).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 3: Depression will be significantly decreased within the 12 months following a&#xD;
      surgical amputation with a 7-day high-concentration perioperative CPNB compared with usual&#xD;
      and customary analgesia (as measured with the Beck Depression Inventory).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypotheses 4 &amp; 5: Phantom and residual limb pain will be significantly decreased within the&#xD;
      12 months following a surgical amputation with a 7-day high-concentration perioperative CPNB&#xD;
      compared with usual and customary analgesia (as measured with Brief Pain Inventory questions&#xD;
      1-4). Current/present, worst, least, and average phantom pain will be assessed using a&#xD;
      Numeric Rating Scale (NRS) included in the Brief Pain Inventory (short form). These same&#xD;
      measures will be included for residual limb pain as well. Additional pain-related data.&#xD;
      Frequency and average duration of non-painful phantom sensations, phantom limb pain, and&#xD;
      residual limb pain will also be assessed. In addition, other pain locations/severity will be&#xD;
      evaluated using the NRS. Lastly, to investigate masking adequacy, subjects will be queried&#xD;
      the day following catheter removal on the infusion type they believe they received (active&#xD;
      drug vs. placebo).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 6: Opioid consumption will be significantly decreased within the 12 months&#xD;
      following a surgical amputation with a 7-day high-concentration perioperative CPNB compared&#xD;
      with usual and customary analgesia (measured in oral morphine equivalents).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Supplemental analgesic use will be recorded at all time points.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection. Subject demographic, surgical and CPNB administration data will be uploaded&#xD;
      from each enrolling center via the Internet to a secure, password-protected, encrypted&#xD;
      central server (RedCap, Department of Outcomes Research, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, Ohio).&#xD;
      The questionnaires for all subjects-regardless of enrolling center-will be administered by&#xD;
      telephone from the University of California San Diego. Staff masked to treatment group&#xD;
      assignment will perform all assessments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Plan and Data Analysis Primary analyses will be modified intent-to-treat, such&#xD;
      that all randomized patients who receive at least some of the study intervention will be&#xD;
      included in the analyses. All patients will be analyzed in the group to which they were&#xD;
      randomized.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1 - Mobility (H1). We will assess the treatment effect of continuous peripheral nerve&#xD;
      blocks (CPNB) versus standard therapy on the primary outcome of the Locomotor Capabilities&#xD;
      Index (LCI) at 9 months using a proportional odds logistic regression model, as long as the&#xD;
      proportional odds assumption holds (i.e., P-value &gt; 0.05 assessing proportional odds). In the&#xD;
      event that the proportional odds assumption does not hold, we will compare groups using an&#xD;
      extension of the Wilcoxon rank-sum test to allow covariate adjustment. The primary analysis&#xD;
      will use the total LCI score (range 0-56), while the basic and advanced LCI&#xD;
      subscales-comprised of 7 questions each-will be considered as secondary. Additional secondary&#xD;
      analyses will compare groups at each of 6 and 12 months on the same outcome. We do not use&#xD;
      repeated measures or longitudinal data models because we do not expect the treatment effect&#xD;
      to be consistent across 6, 9 and 12 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1 - General physical and emotional disability (H2). We will assess the effect of CPBN on&#xD;
      general physical and emotional disability as measured by the World Health Organization&#xD;
      Disability Assessment Schedule 2 (WHODAS2) questionnaire across time points 1, 3, 6, 9 and 12&#xD;
      months post-randomization using a linear mixed effects model to account for the&#xD;
      within-subject correlation over time (assuming an auto-regressive correlation structure).&#xD;
      Baseline WHODAS2 scores will be adjusted for in order to gain precision in the treatment&#xD;
      effect estimates. The WHODAS2 overall score across the 36 items and the 6 subscale scores&#xD;
      will be calculated for each exam using the complex scoring algorithm (called&#xD;
      &quot;item-response-theory&quot; (IRT) based scoring) which takes into account multiple levels of&#xD;
      difficulty for each WHODAS 2.0 item. Scores will then be converted to a 0 (no disability) to&#xD;
      100 (full disability) scale for ease of interpretation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1 - Depression (H3). We will assess the effect of CPBN on depression at 12 months post&#xD;
      randomization as measured by the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI-II) using a multiple linear&#xD;
      regression model to adjust for baseline BDI scores and clinical site, as well as to assess&#xD;
      the treatment group-by-site interaction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2 - Phantom limb pain (H4), Residual limb pain (H5), opioid consumption (H6). We will&#xD;
      assess the effect of CPBN on each of phantom limb pain, residual limb pain and opioid&#xD;
      consumption over time using linear mixed effects models as specified above for analysis of&#xD;
      the WHODAS2 score. In these models we will assess the treatment-group by time interaction&#xD;
      over all times (postoperative days 1, 2, 8, months 1, 3, 6, 9, 12) and also the interaction&#xD;
      between treatment group and early times (postoperative days 1, 2, 8) versus late times&#xD;
      (postoperative months 1, 3, 6, 9, 12).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Opioid consumption will be log-transformed (or other appropriate transformation) to achieve&#xD;
      normality in the observed data before modeling and will be analyzed as the amount of opioids&#xD;
      being consumed at each time point. Throughout these models we will adjust for baseline pain&#xD;
      score or opioid consumption as a covariate to improve precision of the treatment effect&#xD;
      estimates.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interim analyses. We will conduct interim analyses for efficacy and futility at each 25% of&#xD;
      planned enrollment using a group sequential design and gamma spending function for alpha&#xD;
      (efficacy, parameter -4) and beta (futility, gamma parameter -2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size considerations. We powered this trial to be able to detect a clinically important&#xD;
      difference between groups on the primary outcome of the LCI-5 at 9 months post-randomization&#xD;
      with 90% power at the 0.05 significance level. While the minimal clinically important&#xD;
      difference (MCID) for the LCI remains undetermined, current literature suggests that the MCID&#xD;
      for similar instruments is about 10% of the possible range of the scores, or else, similarly,&#xD;
      about half of a standard deviation of the score (please see following paragraph for details&#xD;
      on the MCID). For our study we therefore power the study to detect a difference of 5.6 on the&#xD;
      56-point LCI total score, and we assume a SD of 11 for the total score (Larsson, 2009&#xD;
      observed SD of 9 and 11 for two different time points). With the given assumptions we would&#xD;
      require 89 subjects per group, or a total of 178 for a 2-sample t-test. While the analysis&#xD;
      will utilize a proportional odds logistic regression, with a range of 56 points the outcome&#xD;
      variable might be close to normally distributed and the power for the planned test is&#xD;
      expected be close to that of a 2-sample t-test on the same data. Incorporating the planned&#xD;
      interim analyses at each 25% of total enrollment, the study requires a maximum total of 203&#xD;
      subjects. Expecting a maximum of 7-8% of patients lost-to-follow-up or withdrawn by 9 months,&#xD;
      we will enroll a maximum total of 218 patients to achieve the goal of N=203 for analysis.&#xD;
