  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Early intervention programs for psychosis help improve short-term treatment and recovery&#xD;
      outcomes for individuals experiencing psychosis. OnTrackNY is a coordinated specialty care&#xD;
      (CSC) program, developed to treat young adults within two years of experiencing a&#xD;
      non-affective episode of psychosis. This project aims to expand the role of family engagement&#xD;
      and support within the OnTrackNY model. Borrowing from the Needs Adapted and Open Dialogue&#xD;
      models, the study team created a family therapy service that includes the client and members&#xD;
      of his/her social network to navigate crises and assist in treatment planning. This service,&#xD;
      Social Network Meetings, will be offered to individuals enrolled in the OnTrackNY@MHA program&#xD;
      as an additional, voluntary, service option. The study proposes that the introduction of&#xD;
      Social Network meetings may improve treatment and recovery outcomes.&#xD;

      This project aims to expand the role of family engagement and support within the OnTrackNY&#xD;
      model by offering a new service, Social Network Meetings. The study team will offer Social&#xD;
      Network Meetings to individuals enrolled in the OnTrackNY@MHA program as an additional&#xD;
      service option. This option will be completely voluntary and available for a 12 month period.&#xD;
      Participant entrance into the study will be staggered with no more than approximately 5&#xD;
      individuals in the Social Network group and no more than 5 individuals not in the Social&#xD;
      Network group enrolled each month. Participants will choose which group they would like to be&#xD;
      in, if any. Data will be collected for all participants, both those participating and not&#xD;
      participating in the Social Network Meetings upon entering the study and then once every&#xD;
      three months and at the end of their time in the study. For all participants, the study will&#xD;
      end after 6 months of participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Meetings may occur as often as 3 times a week when there is a crisis or more commonly would&#xD;
      occur once every other week. These meetings will last between 60 and 90 minutes and will take&#xD;
      place for however long the clients and their social networks would like within the project&#xD;
      period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study aims are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To determine the extent to which clients and their social networks find the Social&#xD;
           Network meetings acceptable and beneficial.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To compare outcomes (family functioning, recovery) of individuals participating in&#xD;
           Social Network meetings to those not participating.&#xD;

Entrance of clients into the study will be staggered with no more than approximately 5 individuals in the Social Network group and no more than 5 individuals not in the Social Network group enrolled each month. There will be a maximum of 15 participants (clients) in each group.&#xD;

    <time_frame>We will measure scores at baseline, 3 months and 6 months to determine change between these assessment points</time_frame>
    <description>The QPR is a 15-item self-report survey which assesses individuals' perceptions of self and factors that are important to recovery. Items on the QPR are rated on a 5-point Likert scale and range from &quot;disagree strongly&quot; to &quot;agree strongly.&quot;</description>

    <time_frame>We will measure scores at baseline, 3 months and 6 months to determine change between these assessment points</time_frame>
    <description>The SCORE-15 is a 15-item self-report survey which assesses perceptions about a family's level of intimacy and support for one another. It asks both clients and social network members to give impressions about the level of disclosure between family members, perceptions of trust, and how the family deals conflict and crisis.</description>

These meetings will last between 60 and 90 minutes and will take place for however long the clients and their social networks would like within the project period. Ideally, each client and his/her Social Network would participate in 4 meetings during the 6 month period. This group would continue to receive care as usual with the addition of these meetings.&#xD;
