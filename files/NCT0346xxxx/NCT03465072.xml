  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) accounts for approximately half of the&#xD;
      heart failure population in the United States. The primary chronic symptom in patients with&#xD;
      HFpEF is severe exercise intolerance quantified as reduced peak oxygen uptake during whole&#xD;
      body exercise (peak V̇O2). To date, studies have focused almost exclusively on central&#xD;
      cardiac limitations of peak V̇O2 in HFpEF. However, in stark contrast to heart failure with&#xD;
      reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF), drug therapies targeting central limitations have&#xD;
      invariably failed to improve peak V̇O2, quality of life, or survival in HFpEF. Emerging&#xD;
      evidence from our lab suggests reduced skeletal muscle oxidative capacity may contribute to&#xD;
      exercise intolerance in HFpEF patients. However, the mechanisms responsible for peripheral&#xD;
      metabolic inefficiency remain unclear. Reduced blood flow (oxygen delivery), and slowed&#xD;
      oxygen uptake kinetics (O2 utilization) may both contribute to reduced peripheral oxidative&#xD;
      capacity. Importantly, reduced oxidative capacity may result in increased production of&#xD;
      metabolites known to activate muscle afferent nerves and stimulate reflex increases in muscle&#xD;
      sympathetic (vasoconstrictor) nervous system activity (MSNA). However, to date there have&#xD;
      been no studies specifically investigating the contribution of peripheral metabolic and&#xD;
      neural impairments to reduced exercise capacity in HFpEF. The overall aim of this proposal&#xD;
      will be 1) to identify impairments in peripheral vascular, metabolic, and sympathetic neural&#xD;
      function and 2) to assess the ability of small muscle mass (knee extensor, KE) training,&#xD;
      specifically targeting these peripheral skeletal muscle deficiencies, to improve aerobic&#xD;
      capacity and exercise tolerance in HFpEF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      GLOBAL HYPOTHESIS 1: HFpEF patients will demonstrate reduced skeletal muscle oxygen delivery,&#xD;
      slowed oxygen uptake kinetics, and elevated resting and metaboreflex mediated MSNA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 1.1: The vasodilatory response to knee extensor exercise will be impaired in HFpEF&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 1.1: To measure the immediate rapid onset vasodilatory response to muscle&#xD;
      contraction, as well as the dynamic onset, and steady state vasodilatory responses to dynamic&#xD;
      KE exercise.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 1.2: Skeletal muscle oxygen uptake kinetics will be slowed in HFpEF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 1.2: To measure pulmonary oxygen uptake kinetics during isolated KE exercise in&#xD;
      order to isolate peripheral impairments in metabolic function independent of any central&#xD;
      impairment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 1.3: HFpEF patients will demonstrate elevated MSNA at rest, and exaggerated&#xD;
      metaboreflex sensitivity during exercise.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 1.3: To test this hypothesis the investigators will measure MSNA from the&#xD;
      peroneal nerve at rest, and during post exercise ischemia to directly assess metaboreflex&#xD;
      sensitivity in HFpEF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      GLOBAL HYPOTHESIS 2: Isolating peripheral adaptations to exercise training using single KE&#xD;
      exercise training will improve peripheral vascular, metabolic, and neural function and result&#xD;
      in greater functional capacity in HFpEF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 2.1: Isolated KE exercise training will improve the vasodilatory response to&#xD;
      exercise, speed oxygen uptake kinetics, and reduce MSNA at rest HFpEF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 2.1: The assessments of vascular, metabolic, and neural function proposed in&#xD;
      hypothesis 1 will be repeated after completing 8 weeks of single KE exercise training.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 2.2: Single KE exercise training will improve whole body exercise tolerance, peak&#xD;
      V̇O2, and functional capacity in HFpEF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 2.2: To test this hypothesis the investigators will measure maximal single KE&#xD;
      work rate, V̇O2 kinetics and peak V̇O2 during cycle exercise, as well as distance covered in&#xD;
      the six minute walk test.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Protocol 1.1: To test hypothesis 1.1 the investigators will measure rapid onset vasodilation&#xD;
      in response to a single KE contraction as a marker of vascular responsiveness to muscle&#xD;
      contraction, as well as the dynamic onset, and steady state vasodilatory responses to&#xD;
      continuous KE exercise. The rapid onset vasodilatory (ROV) response to a brief (1-second)&#xD;
      single isometric knee extension contraction will be measured as described by our&#xD;
      collaborators50. Subjects will perform single contractions at 5, 10 or 20% of their maximal&#xD;
      voluntary contraction (MVC). Beat-by-beat local vascular responses (i.e. femoral blood flow;&#xD;
      FBF and vascular conductance; FVC) will be recorded continuously for 30-seconds with the&#xD;
      initial response (first un-interrupted cardiac cycle post-contraction), peak response&#xD;
      (maximal increase), latency (time to peak response) and area under the curve (total&#xD;
      vasodilator response across 30-seconds) analyzed to fully characterize ROV in HFpEF.&#xD;
      Additionally, the vascular and hemodynamic response to dynamic KE exercise (beat-by-beat&#xD;
      onset and steady state FBF and FVC) will be measured from the onset of exercise for six&#xD;
      minutes at submaximal work rates (10, 15 W, and 60% maximal work rate). These trials will be&#xD;
      performed individually and with 20 minutes of rest between conditions to ensure that patients&#xD;
      will be able to complete each of these trials. In addition to local vascular hemodynamics,&#xD;
      systemic hemodynamics (HR, MAP, CO, SV) will be monitored throughout to confirm that any&#xD;
      alterations in local blood flow are independent of central cardiovascular adjustments (See&#xD;
      Fig. 2, Day 2)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 1.2: Skeletal muscle V̇O2 kinetics will be slowed in HFpEF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Protocol 1.2: Breath-by-breath pulmonary V̇O2 kinetics will be measured during cycle exercise&#xD;
      at a relatively light work rate of 20 W (~30% V̇O2 peak) to characterize V̇O2 kinetics where&#xD;
      there is no cardiac limitation, allowing for a submaximal assessment of &quot;peripheral&quot;&#xD;
      oxidative efficiency during large muscle mass exercise. During cycle exercise, V̇O2 kinetics&#xD;
      will be measured in conjunction near infrared spectroscopy as a marker of the coupling&#xD;
      between oxygen delivery and demand (see Fig. 2, Day 3).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 1.3: HFpEF patients will demonstrate elevated MSNA at rest, and exaggerated&#xD;
      metaboreflex sensitivity during exercise.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Protocol 1.3: Microneurography will be used to measure multi-unit muscle sympathetic nerve&#xD;
      discharge in subjects at rest, during dynamic knee extension exercise (30, 40% MVC), and&#xD;
      during 2 minutes and 15 seconds of post-exercise ischemia (PEI) achieved via inflation of a&#xD;
      blood pressure cuff to supra-systolic pressure. This approach allows for experimental&#xD;
      isolation of the metaboreflex contribution to changes in MSNA and hemodynamics by preventing&#xD;
      washout of metabolites produced by muscle contraction during exercise. Importantly, the&#xD;
      sympathetic response is independent of the confounding activation of the mechanoreflex or&#xD;
      central command as muscle contractions are no longer being performed. A cold pressor test&#xD;
      will be utilized to confirm specific sensitivity to the metaboreflex and not generalized&#xD;
      sensitivity to sympathoexcitatory stimuli. Multi-unit post-ganglionic MSNA will be recorded&#xD;
      from the peroneal nerve using standard microneurographic techniques and quantified as burst&#xD;
      frequency (bursts/min), burst incidence (burst/100 cardiac cycles) and total activity (burst&#xD;
      frequency x mean burst amplitude).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experimental Series 2 - Global Hypothesis 2: isolating peripheral adaptations to exercise&#xD;
      training using single KE exercise training will improve peripheral vascular, metabolic, and&#xD;
      neural function and result in greater functional capacity in HFpEF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Approach: Hypothesis 2.1: Isolated KE exercise training will improve the vasodilatory&#xD;
      response to exercise, speed V̇O2 kinetics, and reduce MSNA at rest HFpEF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Protocol 2.1: 1) Vascular response: ROV will be assessed as described in protocol 1. Subjects&#xD;
      will perform single contractions at 5, 10 or 20% of their pre- and post-testing maximal&#xD;
      voluntary contraction (MVC). The peripheral hemodynamic response to dynamic KE exercise&#xD;
      (beat-by-beat onset and steady state) will be measured continuously from the onset of&#xD;
      exercise for six minutes at the same absolute (10, and 15 W) and relative (60% of&#xD;
      post-intervention maximal work rate) exercise intensities. Local vascular (FBF, FVC) and&#xD;
      systemic (HR, MAP, CO, SV) hemodynamics will be monitored throughout these trials to confirm&#xD;
      that any alterations in local blood flow are independent of central cardiovascular&#xD;
      adaptations (See Fig 2, Day 2). 2) V̇O2 Kinetics: Breath-by-breath Pulmonary V̇O2 kinetics&#xD;
      will be measured during isolated single KE exercise and during upright cycle exercise.&#xD;
      Dynamic KE exercise will be performed for six minutes at the same absolute submaximal work&#xD;
      rates (10 and 15 W) as well as the same relative (60% post-intervention maximal work rate;&#xD;
      see Fig 2, Day 2) in conjunction with beat-by-beat blood flow measures. Additionally, V̇O2&#xD;
      kinetics will be assessed during mild intensity cycle exercise at 20 W and utilized as a&#xD;
      marker of intervention efficacy as discussed above (see Fig. 2, Day 3). 3) MSNA:&#xD;
      Microneurography will be used to measure multi-unit muscle sympathetic nerve discharge in&#xD;
      subjects at rest, during knee extension exercise, and PEI (See Fig 2, Day 3).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 2.2: Single KE exercise training will improve whole body exercise tolerance, peak&#xD;
      V̇O2, and functional capacity in HFpEF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Protocol 2.2: In addition to submaximal V̇O2 kinetics: maximal KE work rate, peak V̇O2 during&#xD;
      cycle exercise, and performance in the 6-minute walk test will be re-evaluated after isolated&#xD;
      quadriceps exercise training in the same manner as prior to the intervention (see specific&#xD;
      exercise training protocol below).&#xD;
