  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The current study focuses on the localization and quantitative assessment of growth factors&#xD;
      and cytokines related to the EMT process found in the human gingival tissue samples taken&#xD;
      from periodontally diseased individuals compared to other samples taken from healthy&#xD;
      individuals. Through this investigation the correlation between the severity of the disease&#xD;
      and the amount of these factors will be studied aiming to alleviation of the high prevalence&#xD;
      of periodontal diseases among the Egyptian population.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>

      In a case control human study The existence and the amount of the indicators and cytokines&#xD;
      for EMT in the gingival tissue samples taken from the periodontitis patients will be&#xD;
      investigated and compared to those in healthy individuals using histopathology and real time&#xD;
      PCR to reveal the role of these factors in periodontal disease incidence in humans.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Total of 36 participants will be recruited in this study The participants will be divided&#xD;
      according to their periodontal status into four groups (healthy, mild, moderate and severe&#xD;
      periodontitis) 9 patients in each group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The periodontal screening of patients will be done using mouth mirror and graduated&#xD;
      Williams's periodontal probe for the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Gingival status will be assessed by using gingival index&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Periodontal pocket depth.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Clinical attachment loss.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Radiographic examination using panoramic technique. Screening criteria for chronic&#xD;
           periodontitis was the presence of at least 5 sites with 4 mm horizontal alveolar bone&#xD;
           loss on radiographs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Gingival tissue samples will be harvested during periodontal surgery and extraction of the&#xD;
      periodontally hopeless tooth for the periodontitis patients and during the premolar&#xD;
      extraction (Orthodontic ttt) or third molar extraction for the healthy controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The dissected gingival samples will be washed in saline solution and fixed in 4% buffered&#xD;
      formalin for 48 hours, dehydrated in ascending grades of ethyl alcohol, cleared in xylene and&#xD;
      embedded in paraffin and will be subjected to the following:.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Sections of 4-5 µm in thickness will be obtained, deparaffinized, rehydrated and&#xD;
           subjected to histological staining and histomorphometric analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Real time- PCR for TGF-B1 ,Vimenten , E-Cadherin .&#xD;
