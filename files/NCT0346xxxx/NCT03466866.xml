    <textblock>
      This RCT will compare the efficacy of Preventing and Reducing Emergency Visits in Diabetes&#xD;
      through Education and Trust (PREVENT) vs. intensive home-based diabetes (DM) education [i.e.,&#xD;
      Enhanced Usual Care (EUC)] to reduce DM-related emergency department (ED) visits and/or&#xD;
      hospitalizations over 12 months (primary outcome) in 230 blacks with diabetes, 50 years and&#xD;
      older, after an ED visit. A moderation analysis will determine whether participants who&#xD;
      reside in low- vs. high-need communities [defined by Community Need Index scores (i.e., an&#xD;
      indicator of the built environment)] respond differently to treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PREVENT is a collaborative intervention of Primary Care Physicians, (PCPs), a DM nurse&#xD;
      educator, and Community Health Workers (CHWs) that extends from the ED into the community.&#xD;
      The CHWs will: 1) deliver in-home DM education to increase participants' knowledge and skills&#xD;
      to manage DM; 2) use DM-specific Behavioral Activation to reinforce DM self-care; and 3)&#xD;
      facilitate telehealth visits with PCPs and a DM nurse educator to increase access to care.&#xD;
      The control treatment, EUC, is home-based intensive DM education. EUC matches PREVENT in&#xD;
      treatment intensity (i.e., number and duration of in-home visits) and delivery of DM&#xD;
      self-care education, but does not include PREVENTS's other active elements (i.e., Behavioral&#xD;
      Activation and telehealth). The treatment comparison will identify PREVENTS's specific&#xD;
      efficacy over and above EUC. We hypothesize that PREVENT will halve the rate of incident&#xD;
      DM-related ED visits and/or hospitalizations relative to EUC. The three secondary outcomes&#xD;
      are: 1) subjective perceptions of access to care; 2) receipt of DM Quality Metrics (i.e.,&#xD;
      objective indicators of realized access to care); and 3) DM self-care.&#xD;

      This Phase-III RCT will compare the efficacy of Preventing and Reducing Emergency Visits in&#xD;
      Diabetes through Education and Trust (PREVENT) vs. intensive home-based DM education to&#xD;
      reduce the number of DM-related ED visits and/or hospitalizations over 12 months (primary&#xD;
      outcome), in 230 AAs with DM, 40 years and older, who are recruited from the ED after an ED&#xD;
      visit. PREVENT is a culturally relevant intervention that extends from the ED to the&#xD;
      community, and aims to improve access to care and DM self-care (secondary outcomes). A&#xD;
      mediation analysis will determine whether changes in access to care and/or DM self-care&#xD;
      explain PREVENT's efficacy. A moderation analysis will determine whether participants who&#xD;
      reside in low- vs. high-need communities [defined by Community Need Index scores (i.e., an&#xD;
      indicator of the built environment)] respond differently to treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PREVENT will begin soon after the participant's index ED visit, when many patients remain&#xD;
      uncertain how to manage DM or how to access follow-up care. Community Health Workers (CHWs),&#xD;
      who are race-concordant with participants, will: 1) deliver in-home DM education to increase&#xD;
      participants' knowledge and skills; 2) use DM-specific Behavioral Activation to improve DM&#xD;
      self-care; and 3) facilitate telehealth visits with the participant's primary care physician&#xD;
      (PCP) and a DM nurse educator to increase access to care. The control treatment, EUC, is&#xD;
      intensive home-based DM education. EUC matches PREVENT in treatment intensity (i.e., 6&#xD;
      in-home sessions over 4 months, and 3 booster sessions over the next 8 months) and delivery&#xD;
      of culturally relevant DM education, but does not include DM-specific Behavioral Activation&#xD;
      or telehealth visits. The treatment comparison will identify PREVENT's specific efficacy over&#xD;
      and above EUC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This RCT is significant as the population ages and becomes more racially diverse, and as ED&#xD;
      use and costs increase. This RCT is innovative because it: 1) tests the first ED-to-community&#xD;
      intervention designed to reduce the need for ED care in AAs with DM; 2) assesses both&#xD;
      subjective and objective indicators of access to care; and 3) defines the specific&#xD;
      characteristics of COPDE that confer its cultural relevance. If successful, PREVENT will meet&#xD;
      Healthy People 2020's twin goals of reducing the personal and societal costs of DM and&#xD;
      achieving health equity for all Americans. The Specific Aims of this RCT are:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Specific Aim: Test the efficacy of PREVENT to reduce the number of incident&#xD;
      DM-related ED visits and/or hospitalizations over 12 months (primary outcome) in AAs with DM.&#xD;
      Hypothesis: PREVENT will halve the number of incident DM-related ED visits and/or&#xD;
      hospitalizations relative to EUC over 12 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Secondary Aims are to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Test the efficacy of PREVENT to increase perceived access to care over 12 months&#xD;
           (secondary outcome). Hypothesis: PREVENT will increase Patient Satisfaction&#xD;
           Questionnaire-18 scores to a greater extent than EUC over 12 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Test the efficacy of PREVENT to increase realized access to care over 12 months&#xD;
           (secondary outcome). Hypothesis: PREVENT will increase the number of received Diabetes&#xD;
           Quality Metrics (e.g., hemoglobin A1c testing, urine screening) to a greater extent than&#xD;
           EUC over 12 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Test the efficacy of PREVENT to improve DM self-care over 12 months (secondary outcome).&#xD;
           Hypothesis: PREVENT will increase Diabetes Self-Care Inventory scores to a greater&#xD;
           extent than EUC over 12 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Determine if increasing subjective and/or objective indicators of access to care and/or&#xD;
           DM self-care mediates PREVENT's reduction of DM-related ED visits and/or&#xD;
           hospitalizations. Hypothesis: PREVENT will reduce DM-related ED visits and/or&#xD;
           hospitalizations to the extent that it increases subjective and/or objective indicators&#xD;
           of access to care and/or improves DM self-care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Exploratory Aims are to: 1) determine whether PREVENT reduces &quot;all cause&quot; ED&#xD;
      visits/hospitalizations relative to EUC.; 2) determine whether Community Need Index scores,&#xD;
      literacy, age, and/or sex moderate treatment effects; 3) determine if PREVENT improves&#xD;
      glycemic control (i.e., lowers hemoglobin A1c levels), impacts DM-related health beliefs,&#xD;
      reduces depression, and/or improves quality-of-life; 4) identify PREVENT's treatment features&#xD;
      that confer its cultural relevance; and 5) estimate PREVENT's costs and net financial benefit&#xD;
      to the healthcare system.&#xD;

    <description>The primary efficacy analysis will consider the number of incident diabetes-related ED visits and/or hospitalizations (i.e., an &quot;event&quot;) over 12 months after the index ED visit. Each ED visit or hospitalization is counted as a single event (although an ED visit that leads to a hospitalization is counted once). ED visits and hospitalization will be ascertained through chart reviews and subject self-report.</description>
