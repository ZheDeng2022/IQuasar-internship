      It is not yet known which protocols are a better treatment for glioblastoma or glioma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The ipilimumab extended-access program for patients who received previous chemotherapy and /&#xD;
      or radiation therapy by protocol, before ((for non-operable cases) or after the operation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Monoclonal antibodies of CTLA-4, such as ipilimumab, may block tumor growth in different ways&#xD;
      by targeting certain cells and activating the patient's immune system to fight the disease.&#xD;

    <description>Each patient receives Ipilimumab in regimen and dose according to the official manufacturer's instructions (IV 1 mg / kg every 6 weeks for maximum of 4 doses).&#xD;
Participation of the patient in the program must necessarily be agreed with the current treatment and contain a written agreement with the attending physician.&#xD;
This program is not covered by health insurance. For patients in the postoperative period to provide a mandatory conclusion of histology and molecular-genetic for the identified mutations and the type of tumor.</description>
