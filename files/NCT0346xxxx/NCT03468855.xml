&#xD;
          1. Subject has a clinical diagnosis of new onset or actively progressing non-segmental&#xD;
             facial vitiligo or worsening of existing facial lesions within the past 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Subject has non-segmental facial vitiligo effecting at least 0.25% total body surface&#xD;
             area (TBSA) (excluding the upper and lower eyelids, mucosal lip areas and forehead and&#xD;
             chin areas covered by the stereotactic positioning device for photography) with at&#xD;
             least one area of the face with normal pigmentation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Women of childbearing potential (WOCBP) must have a negative serum pregnancy test at&#xD;
             the screening visit and a negative urine pregnancy test at the baseline visit and must&#xD;
             agree to use an approved method of highly effective birth control for the duration of&#xD;
             the study and for 30 days after last study medication application.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Subject is in good general health and free of any known disease state or physical&#xD;
             condition which, in the opinion of the investigator, would interfere with the study&#xD;
             assessments or put the subject at undue risk by study participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Subject agrees to refrain from any other treatments for vitiligo from the screening&#xD;
             visit through the final follow-up visit. Over the counter (OTC) preparations deemed&#xD;
             acceptable by the investigator and camouflage makeups are permitted.&#xD;

        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Subject with evidence of poliosis (white hairs) in &gt; 50% of their facial vitiligo&#xD;
             lesions.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Subject with total facial depigmentation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Subject with spontaneous ongoing repigmentation (documented based on the subject's&#xD;
             reporting in the last 3 months).&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Subject who has segmental vitiligo.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Subject who has failed phototherapy. Failed phototherapy is defined as failure to&#xD;
             achieve satisfactory repigmentation following adequately delivered phototherapy as&#xD;
             determined by the investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Subject currently has, or has a history of, skin disease (e.g., psoriasis, seborrheic&#xD;
             dermatitis, etc.) that, in the opinion of the investigator, would interfere with the&#xD;
             study medication application or study assessments.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Subject has, or has a history of, severe, progressive or uncontrolled autoimmune,&#xD;
             metabolic, renal, hepatic, gastrointestinal, pulmonary, cardiovascular, genitourinary&#xD;
             (i.e.,renal disease), hematological disease, neurologic or cerebral disorders,&#xD;
             infectious disease or coagulation disorders that, in the opinion of the investigator,&#xD;
             would interfere with the study assessments or put the subject at undue risk by study&#xD;
             participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Subject currently has a history of, current, or suspected systemic or cutaneous&#xD;
             malignancy and/or lymphoproliferative disease, other than a history of adequately&#xD;
             treated, well healed and completely cleared non-melanoma skin cancers (e.g., basal or&#xD;
             squamous cell carcinoma) treated successfully at least 1 year prior to study entry&#xD;
             with no evidence of disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Subject currently has evidence of active or latent bacterial (including tuberculosis)&#xD;
             or viral infections at the time of enrollment, or a history of incompletely treated or&#xD;
             untreated tuberculosis. Subjects who have initiated therapy for latent tuberculosis&#xD;
             for at least 2 weeks and agree to continue their therapy through completion may&#xD;
             participate.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Subject has a history of serious local infection (e.g., cellulitis, abscess) or&#xD;
             systemic infection, or history of treated infection (e.g., pneumonia, septicemia)&#xD;
             within 3 months prior to the baseline visit. Subjects on an antibiotic for a&#xD;
             nonserious, acute local infection must complete the course prior to enrollment into&#xD;
             the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Subject has herpes zoster or cytomegalovirus (CMV) that resolved within 8 weeks prior&#xD;
             to Visit 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Subject has a history of frequent outbreaks of oral Herpes Simplex Virus defined as&#xD;
             more than 4 episodes per year.&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. Subjects previously treated with depigmenting agents.&#xD;
&#xD;
         14. Clinically significant laboratory abnormalities at screening that in the opinion of&#xD;
             the investigator, would make the subject a poor candidate for the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
         15. Subject who has an absolute neutrophil count &lt;1,000/mm3, or platelet count &lt;&#xD;
             50,000/mL.&#xD;
&#xD;
         16. Subject unable to comply with the required washout periods&#xD;
&#xD;
         17. Subject who has participated in any investigational drug or device trial, regardless&#xD;
             of indication in which administration of an investigational drug or device occurred&#xD;
             within 30 days or 5 half-lives (whichever is longer) of screening (Visit 1). Note that&#xD;
             investigational treatment for vitiligo (in any body area) requires a longer washout&#xD;
&#xD;
         18. Subjects with a clinically significant abnormal thyroid-stimulating hormone or free T4&#xD;
             at screening. Subjects under treatment with stable thyroid replacement who have a free&#xD;
             T4 and TSH within the normal range may participate.&#xD;
&#xD;
         19. Subject has history of sensitivity to any of the ingredients in the study medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
         20. Subject has a history of, or current alcohol or drug abuse within 2 years of study&#xD;
             enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
         21. Screening ECG findings of:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. QTcF &gt;450msec for males or &gt;470msec for females (use of the ECG algorithm is&#xD;
                  acceptable for this purpose)&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Heart rate ≤ 45 or ≥ 100 beats/minutes&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. Rhythm disturbance other than sinus arrhythmia or ectopic supraventricular rhythm&#xD;
                  (ectopic atrial rhythm)&#xD;
&#xD;
               4. Conduction disturbance including PR &gt;240msec, pre-excitation (delta wave and PR&#xD;
                  &lt;120msec), second degree or higher AV block&#xD;
&#xD;
               5. Acute or chronic signs of ischemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
               6. Left Bundle Branch Block&#xD;
&#xD;
               7. Prior myocardial infarction&#xD;

          <title>Treatment Success Based on the Subject's Assessment of Vitiligo on the Vitiligo Noticeability Scale (VNS) at Week 40</title>
          <description>The Vitiligo Noticeability Scale (VNS) represents the subject's assessment of the noticeability of facial vitiligo during the study treatment period by means of answering the question, &quot;Compared to before treatment, how noticeable is the vitiligo now?&quot; Subject response options include, &quot;1: More Noticeable&quot;, &quot;2: As Noticeable&quot;, &quot;3: Slightly Less Noticeable&quot;, &quot;4: A Lot Less Noticeable&quot;, and &quot;5: No Longer Noticeable&quot;. Treatment success will be defined as follows: VNS score of 1 or 2 = treatment not successful, VNS score of 3 = treatment partially successful, or VNS score of 4 or 5 = treatment successful. Higher scores represent better outcomes.</description>
