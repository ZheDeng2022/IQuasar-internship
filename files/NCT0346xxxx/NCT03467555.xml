      Premolar extraction treatment with multibracketed system and reinforced anchorage has been a&#xD;
      common modality for correcting maxillary incisor crowding or Class II malocclusion in&#xD;
      nongrowing patients. Treatment of Class II malocclusion without extraction frequently&#xD;
      requires distalization of maxillary molars into Class I relation by means of extraoral or&#xD;
      intraoral forces. Previously, it had been difficult to move maxillary molars distally after&#xD;
      full eruption of maxillary 2nd molars. Extraoral headgear traction restricting the forward&#xD;
      growth of maxilla and /or distalizing the maxillary dentition has been the most commonly used&#xD;
      and oldest method to correct a Class II buccal segment molar relationship.This distalizes not&#xD;
      only 1st molar but also maxillary 1st and 2nd premolars via transeptal fibers. Headgear is&#xD;
      seldom an option in adults due to aesthetics and compliance concerns. The disadvantages of&#xD;
      extraoral appliances have motivated many investigators to develop the mechanics of intraoral&#xD;
      molar distalization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Various intraoral non compliance appliances like nickel-titanium spring , magnets , distal&#xD;
      jet , pendulum appliances have been used to distalize maxillary molars. However, in these&#xD;
      appliances, anchorage loss characterized by protrusion of maxillary incisors and an increase&#xD;
      in overjet is seen. Also considerable amount of relapse occurred when the distalized molars&#xD;
      were used as anchorage for the retraction of anteriors and premolar teeth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Absolute skeletal anchorage available 24 hours a day is an alternative method for molar&#xD;
      distalization. It provides stationary anchorage for various tooth movements without the need&#xD;
      for active patient compliance and with no undesirable side effects. Miniscrews, which are&#xD;
      generally placed between the roots, limit the amount of distalization possible as they come&#xD;
      in contact with surrounding roots during tooth movement. Also, proximity of miniscrews to the&#xD;
      roots may lead to failure of screw anchorage .These disadvantages can be overcome by the use&#xD;
      of miniplates which are fixed at a distance from the root apices, and therefore do not&#xD;
      interfere in tooth movement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Until now, there have been only a few clinical studies on group distalization of posterior&#xD;
      teeth. Thus, little information is available regarding the type of tooth movement that occurs&#xD;
      and the limitations of distal movement. An attempt was also not made to study the root&#xD;
      resorption and the amount of distal movement or tipping of maxillary 2nd molars since lateral&#xD;
      cephalometric radiographs do not provide a clear view of this region.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To the best of our knowledge, no previous study has been conducted on Cone Beam Computed&#xD;
      Tomography to evaluate the amount of distal movement of entire maxillary dentition using&#xD;
      miniplates placed in zygomatic region and assess the root resorption in all the roots of&#xD;
      maxillary molars. The purpose of this study is to evaluate distal movement of maxillary&#xD;
      dentition using Cone Beam Computed Tomography to overcome the shortcomings of the previous&#xD;
      studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MATERIALS AND METHOD Ours is a prospective clinical study to evaluate the distal movement of&#xD;
      maxillary dentition achieved in three dimensions with miniplates placed in zygomatic region&#xD;
      for the purpose of anchorage. The present study will be conducted in the Department of&#xD;
      Orthodontics and Dentofacial Orthopaedics, in conjunction with Department of Oral and&#xD;
      Maxillofacial Surgery, P.G.I.D.S., Pt. B.D.Sharma University of Health Sciences, Rohtak. The&#xD;
      study will be carried out after the institutional approval obtained from the ethical&#xD;
      committee.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SOURCE OF DATA The sample size consists of 20 subjects selected from the patients attending&#xD;
      the regular Out Patient Department at the Department of Orthodontics and Dentofacial&#xD;
      Orthopaedics for orthodontic treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TARGET SAMPLE SIZE A sample size of 17 for the present study was calculated at 90% power.To&#xD;
      compensate for 10% dropouts the final sample size was calculated to be 20.&#xD;
&#xD;
      INTERVENTION AND DESIGN OF STUDY The main intervention in this clinical trial is surgical&#xD;
      placement of zygomatic miniplates after initial leveling and alignment of maxillary dental&#xD;
      arch. After selection of subjects (patients meeting selection criteria), treatment with&#xD;
      0.022&quot; MBT preadjusted edgewise appliance was started. Maxillary arch will be stabilized with&#xD;
      the help of 0.019&quot; Ã— 0.025&quot; stainless steel wire. Pre-treatment diagnostic records and Cone&#xD;
      Beam Computed Tomography will be taken before placing miniplates . Maxillary 3rd molars will&#xD;
      be extracted, if present . L shaped 2mm titanium miniplates (OrthoMax,Vadodara , India) will&#xD;
      be surgically placed under local anaesthesia in aseptic conditions at zygomatic region&#xD;
      bilaterally. Hooks will be soldered on archwire used for stabilizing dentition. Ni-Ti closed&#xD;
      coil spring/Elastomeric chain will be used to apply a force on both sides (calibrated using&#xD;
      Dontrix Gauge ) from miniplates to soldered hooks. Patient will be recalled at 4 weeks&#xD;
      interval. Records including Cone Beam Computed Tomography will be taken on achievement of&#xD;
      Class I molar relation bilaterally. Lateral cephalograms and CBCT will be taken 2 years post&#xD;
      retention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DATA COLLECTION AND CONE BEAM COMPUTED TOMOGRAPHY ANALYSIS The investigator will record the&#xD;
      patients' name, address, contact number and other relevant case history records will be&#xD;
      taken. Cephalometric radiographs and Cone Beam Computed Tomography and will be recorded&#xD;
      before placement of zygomatic miniplates, on achievement of Class I molar relation&#xD;
      bilaterally and 2 years post retention for assessment of distalization. These records will be&#xD;
      analyzed. The relevant values will be entered in a predesigned format. Soft tissue profile&#xD;
      changes between pretreatment and post treatment will be assessed on lateral cephalogram and&#xD;
      the raters- orthodontist, laypersons,patients,parents and general dentists will assess&#xD;
      changes in facial appearance on a visual analog scale with profile photographs. Patient&#xD;
      perception will be assessed using questionnaire rating by patient regarding various&#xD;
      parameters at 1 week, 2 weeks, 1 month and 6 months after the placement of miniplate in&#xD;
      zygomatic region. Changes in the upper-airway size will be measured by using lateral&#xD;
      cephalometric radiographs taken before and after distalization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      INFORMED CONSENT OF THE PATIENT A valid, informed written consent of the patient or parent/&#xD;
      guardian will be obtained from the patient before registering the patient in this clinical&#xD;
      study . Patient will be informed about all the theoretical risks and benefits of the&#xD;
      intervention under test .Risks and hazards of radiation during CBCT will also be explained to&#xD;
      the patient. The patient will be given 72 hours to discuss the study with his/her family and&#xD;
      take the decision regarding participation in the study&#xD;
