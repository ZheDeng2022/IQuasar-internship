      Background: There is a lack of evidence on whether maternal nutritional deficiencies after&#xD;
      Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) or sleeve gastrectomy (SG) affect fetal development. The&#xD;
      investigators hypothesis is that SG could induce nutritional deficiencies during pregnancy,&#xD;
      as RYGB does, because of food restriction. These nutritional deficiencies may alter fetal&#xD;
      growth. Methods: Women with singleton pregnancies who had at least one nutritional evaluation&#xD;
      during pregnancy in our institution between 2006 and 2017 were included. The investigators&#xD;
      evaluated nutritional deficiencies according to standard and pregnancy-specific norms. They&#xD;
      have planned to study the relationships between these parameters and fetal growth.&#xD;
      Objectives: To compare maternal nutritional parameters and neonatal outcomes after RYGB and&#xD;
      SG and to assess the impact of nutritional alterations on fetal growth.&#xD;

      Design: this study is a retrospective observational study, based on a single-centre database&#xD;
      established since 2004 at the Louis Mourier Hospital in patients who have undergone bariatric&#xD;
      surgery. This study focuses on women who have had at least one nutritional assessment at&#xD;
      Louis Mourier Hospital during their pregnancy between 2004 and 2017. Clinical and biological&#xD;
      data from the database and the data from delivery collected for usual care will be used&#xD;
      retrospectively for this study. Main objective: to compare fetal growth after SG and RYGB.&#xD;
      Primary endpoint: measurement of birth weight.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives and endpoints: - to compare fetal growth after SG and RYGB adjusted for&#xD;
      gestational age and sex (birth weight Z-score).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  to compare the number of small for gestational age after SG and RYGB (birth weight&#xD;
           Z-score &lt;10 th percentile)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  to compare after SG and RYGB nutritional parameters including the following evaluation&#xD;
           criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Before pregnancy: weight and body mass index, weight loss between surgery and early&#xD;
                pregnancy&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. During pregnancy: weight gain, dietary intake, biological parameters measured in&#xD;
                the second trimester of pregnancy, in blood (iron, ferritin, transferrin&#xD;
                saturation, calcium, magnesium, albumin, pre-albumin, vitamins A , D, E, C, B1, B6,&#xD;
                B9, B12, zinc, selenium, parathyroid hormone, homocysteine, hemoglobin, mean cell&#xD;
                volume, hematocrit, blood glucose, triglycerides, cholesterol, insulin) and urine&#xD;
                (calcium, urea, creatinine).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  to compare the number of nutritional deficiencies (number of deficiencies for each&#xD;
           parameter listed above) after SG and RYGB with standard and pregnancy norms.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  to compare the type of deficiency after SG and RYGB (difference between the 2 types of&#xD;
           surgery for each parameter)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  to study the relationship between nutritional parameters and fetal growth after&#xD;
           bariatric surgery (correlations between concentrations of nutritional parameters, birth&#xD;
           weight and birth weight Z-score)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  to study the relationship between nutritional parameters and fetal growth after each&#xD;
           type of surgery (SG and RYGB).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Population studied: pregnant women after bariatric surgery including RYGB and SG. Practical&#xD;
      implementation: for women who are referred to our institution during pregnancy, systematic&#xD;
      vitamin supplementation is prescribed and then adjusted according to the nutritional dosages&#xD;
      performed at least once a trimester. All women benefit from a systematic investigation, which&#xD;
      includes a medical consultation, a dietary survey and fasting biological tests according to&#xD;
      our routine post-operative evaluation. These data are prospectively collected in a database.&#xD;
      They will be used for the study retrospectively. The birth data collected in the medical file&#xD;
      at the end of the pregnancy will also be used for the study retrospectively. An oral&#xD;
      agreement was obtained from all women for the collection of these data for research and a non&#xD;
      opposition form was sended. A questionnaire was sent to women for whom there was missing data&#xD;
      concerning their delivery.&#xD;
