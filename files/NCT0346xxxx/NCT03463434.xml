  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients who have at least one stage 3 or 4 PI and are admitted to a participating treating&#xD;
      facility will be candidates for study enrollment. Patients must provide written informed&#xD;
      consent. Standard care for their admitted condition will be provided for the patients except&#xD;
      for support surface selection, laboratory blood tests, PI measurement(s) by the 3-D camera&#xD;
      measurement tool, and added pain and patient satisfaction assessments. Clinical assessments&#xD;
      will be recorded weekly as described below. Patients will be followed until discharge from&#xD;
      the LTACH or until 1) they require a different mattress for their admitted condition; or 2)&#xD;
      reach a maximum of 12 weeks in the LTACH. At study discontinuation, a clinical general&#xD;
      assessment of the quality of improvement of the PIs will be recorded.&#xD;

      Patients admitted to the LTACH with at least one stage 3 or 4 PI will be evaluated for&#xD;
      possible inclusion/exclusion criteria. Patients will be approached by the investigator, or&#xD;
      their designee to acquire patient informed consent. If provided, patients will be randomized&#xD;
      to their designated support surface, the bed will be ordered and patients will begin the&#xD;
      study with a baseline study visit (week 0) that will include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Date and time of study bed placement&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A brief medical history, that includes current diagnoses, assessment of co-morbidities,&#xD;
           an assessment of neurologic status, nutritional status, level of mobility, history of&#xD;
           current PI's, documentation of treatments that have been applied to PI(s) prior to study&#xD;
           entry&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Braden PU risk assessment (overall and subscores)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Assessment of pain associated with the PI using a pain numeric rating scale (NRS), where&#xD;
           patients rate their current pain intensity from 0 (&quot;no pain&quot;) to 10 (&quot;worst possible&#xD;
           pain&quot;) [21]&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
        -  PI assessments: all PI's located on the lower truncal region of the patient's body will&#xD;
           be assessed both subjectively by the treating clinicians for clinical signs of&#xD;
           infection, as well as by a 3D wound assessment tool.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Overall health status assessment&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subsequent weekly study visits will continue for a maximum of 12 weeks. The interim study&#xD;
      visit documentation will include:&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>This multi-center, randomized, open-label, two treatment, parallel group study is designed to obtain comparative data on the healing rates of type 3 &amp; 4 pressure injuries.&#xD;
The randomization schedule will be set up in blocks, and within a block, the randomization numbers will be assigned equally to the two treatment groups (Envella AFT, FIS bed surface types). A separate randomization schedule will be set up for each stage (3, 4 PI). The anticipated number of investigative sites is 3.</intervention_model_description>
