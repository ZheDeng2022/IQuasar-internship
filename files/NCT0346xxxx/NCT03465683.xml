      The aim of this research project is to investigate the transmission of ESBL-producing&#xD;
      Enterobacteriaceae on both, the level of bacterial strains and mobile genetic elements, and&#xD;
      to determine the source of hospital-acquired infections.&#xD;

      Background and aim The most common bacterial pathogens in humans include several species of&#xD;
      the family of Enterobacteriaceae. Many of them have now become resistant to antibiotics,&#xD;
      i.e.extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBL)-producing Enterobacteriaceae (PE). For a long&#xD;
      time it was thought that transmission in hospitals was the main factor driving their rapid&#xD;
      spread. More recently, though, ESBL-PE have also been found on food and in waste water. These&#xD;
      sources are also likely to play an important role in entertaining transmission.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigator's aim is to identify transmission chains of ESBL-PE in the Basel urban region,&#xD;
      using the latest whole genome sequencing methodologies allowing to determine relatedness of&#xD;
      strains with the highest possible resolution, taking into account sources both within and&#xD;
      outside hospitals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis The finding of few genetically-related clusters of ESBL-PE with an epidemiological&#xD;
      link to hospital contacts would suggest relevant transmission in our healthcare setting. In&#xD;
      contrast, the finding of many genetically-distinct clusters of ESBL-PE without&#xD;
      epidemiological links to the hospital, would question the importance of hospital-wide&#xD;
      transmission in sustaining the ESBL epidemic. This distinction is critical for deriving&#xD;
      effective prevention and control recommendations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design, setting and patients Whole genome sequencing will be performed on representative&#xD;
      ESBL-strains collected from January 2003 to December 2019 at the University Hospital Basel.&#xD;
      The epidemiological relationships between patients with genetically related strains of&#xD;
      ESBL-PE will be assessed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      From June 2017 to December 2019, whole genome sequencing will in addition be performed on&#xD;
      ESBL-strains identified from representative samples from the wastewater system of both the&#xD;
      hospital and the city of Basel as well as representative foodstuff samples collected from&#xD;
      both the hospital and the city of Basel. The epidemiological relationships between patients,&#xD;
      as well as environmental samples with genetically related strains of ESBL-PE and cases with&#xD;
      genetically related plasmids carrying the respective ESBL genes will be assessed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods, planned analysis and sample size To identify transmission events we will employ&#xD;
      whole genome sequencing with Illumina technology, which is established and International&#xD;
      Standards Organization (ISO)-accredited at the Clinical Microbiology Department at the&#xD;
      University Hospital. The proportion of infection/colonization with genetically related&#xD;
      isolates of ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae of the overall infection/colonization rate will&#xD;
      be determined. All phylogenies will be inferred using BEAST v2.046 employing our previously&#xD;
      developed tool for quantifying transmission rates. Overall, 2000 isolates from patient's&#xD;
      samples and 1000 isolates from food and wastewater samples will be analysed.&#xD;
