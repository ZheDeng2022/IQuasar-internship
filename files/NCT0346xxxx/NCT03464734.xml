  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II, single-center study will assess the efficacy of pembrolizumab + nab-paclitaxel&#xD;
      in patients who have metastatic urothelial tumor and do not respond to chemotherapy. The time&#xD;
      between drug administration and progression of the disease will be assessed to determine if&#xD;
      the drug will work.&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In an open-label, single-arm, single-center, phase 2 trial, patients will receive&#xD;
      pembrolizumab 200 mg intravenously (IV) on D1 and nab paclitaxel at the dose of 125 mg/m2 IV&#xD;
      on D1 and D8. Cycles are repeated every 3 weeks until PD or onset of unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
      Key inclusion criteria are: predominant UC, failure of maximum 2 platinum-based CT regimens&#xD;
      for metastatic disease (2nd-to-3rd line only). Neoadjuvant/adjuvant CT is counted if relapse&#xD;
      occurred 6 months of the last CT cycle. Response is evaluated by RECIST criteria v.1.1 every&#xD;
      2 cycles. PD-L1 expression will be prospectively assessed on both immune cells (IC) and tumor&#xD;
      cells at a centralized laboratory (National Cancer Institute Milano). Combined positivity&#xD;
      score (CPS) for PD-L1 assessment will be used, as previously reported, and the 10% cutoff&#xD;
      will be adopted for the analyses. The primary endpoint of the study is the progression-free&#xD;
      survival (PFS). The target is to detect an improvement in the median PFS from 3.0 months (H0)&#xD;
      to 5.0 months (H1). To achieve 90% power with a one-sided non-parametric test at the 10%&#xD;
      significance level, we estimated that 64 patients must be accrued over 18 months, with&#xD;
      follow-up duration of 12 months. PFS will be also analyzed according to the PD-L1 expression.&#xD;
      Should the above investigation suggest that the treatment benefit is stronger in patients&#xD;
      with CPS 10%, there is the option to expand this cohort up to a maximum of 50 patients. As&#xD;
      such, we estimate 85% power to detect the target improvement in PFS. The decision of cohort&#xD;
      expansion will rely on predictive power (PP) calculation: a PP 30% will be regarded as&#xD;
      promising. Translational analyses will include multiparametric flow cytometry of blood&#xD;
      samples, gene expression (RNA-seq, Illumina HiSeq) and mutation profiling of tumor samples&#xD;
      (Ion Torrent Personal Genome Machine). These profiles will be matched with response to&#xD;
      treatment and PFS/overall survival.&#xD;
