  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      FOLFIRINOX regimen is first-line neoadjuvant chemotherapies for patients with locally&#xD;
      advanced pancreatic cancer (LAPC) worldwide. However, FOLFIRINOX is not well accepted in&#xD;
      China because of the high prevalence of adverse events and poor tolerance. To evaluate the&#xD;
      safety and efficacy of modified-FOLFIRINOX (mFOLFIRINOX) in Chinese LAPC patients and compare&#xD;
      survival between LAPC patients with mFOLFIRINOX-based preoperative therapy and LAPC patients&#xD;
      who underwent surgery alone.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      At this institution, a mFOLFIRINOX regimen has been adopted for metastatic pancreatic cancer&#xD;
      (MPC) patients and promising results obtained. The modification resulted in a significantly&#xD;
      reduced prevalence of severe adverse events in MPC patients, whereas the OS and PFS were&#xD;
      extended to 10.3m and 7.0m, respectively, which is similar to that for patients on a&#xD;
      full-dose regimen. Therefore, the investigators further evaluated the efficacy of mFOLFIRINOX&#xD;
      in LAPC patients. Here, investigators want to prospectively enroll LAPC patients who&#xD;
      underwent preoperative therapy with mFOLFIRINOX from April 2014 and compared the surgical&#xD;
      resectability and surgical morbidity/surgical mortality among patients with surgically&#xD;
      resectable pancreatic cancer (RPC) or LAPC who underwent surgery alone retrospectively. For&#xD;
      patients with LAPC, mFOLFIRINOX was administrated for several cycles until the optimal&#xD;
      response was obtained and then patients were evaluated for surgery. Moreover, survival data,&#xD;
      including OS and PFS, were determined.&#xD;
