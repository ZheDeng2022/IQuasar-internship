      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of Latino parent-focused education that&#xD;
      combines enhancing parent engagement, building quality parent-child relationships, promoting&#xD;
      healthy eating and physical activity, and engaging families with community resources for&#xD;
      healthy foods on youth energy balance related behaviors and weight status.&#xD;

      The Latino Parents Promoting Healthy Youth Behavior Project aims to develop and evaluate the&#xD;
      effectiveness of an intervention to prevent obesity among Latino youth (10-14 yrs) by&#xD;
      engaging parents and their families in culturally and linguistically appropriate education.&#xD;
      The goal of this project is to prevent overweight and obesity in Latino adolescents by&#xD;
      increasing the frequency of positive paternal or maternal (or other caregiver) parenting&#xD;
      practices related to the food and physical activity environment in the home (role modeling,&#xD;
      availability, expectations, communication) which will improve weight status of children by&#xD;
      improving energy balance related behaviors (EBRBs) - eating fruits and vegetables and&#xD;
      limiting soft drink, sweets, salty snacks, and fast food consumption, limiting screen time&#xD;
      and increasing physical activity).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective 1) To adapt, implement and evaluate efficacy of a curriculum specifically for&#xD;
      Latino families, using Community-Based Participatory Research (CBPR) that incorporates&#xD;
      parenting education to increase frequency of parenting practices (role modeling,&#xD;
      availability, expectations, communication) to improve EBRBs and weight status of youth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective 2) To evaluate the efficacy of Latino parent-focused education that combines&#xD;
      enhancing parent engagement, building quality parent-child relationships, promoting healthy&#xD;
      eating and physical activity, and engaging families with community resources for healthy&#xD;
      foods on youth EBRBs and weight status.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Formative research and planning will be completed in Years 1-2 including focus group&#xD;
      interviews and consultation with community partners and a Parent Advisory Board. An existing&#xD;
      8-session course curriculum will be adapted. The adapted curriculum will be pilot-tested with&#xD;
      a small group of parents and children in a single group, pre-post design, and revised as&#xD;
      needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In years 2 to 4, a randomized-controlled trial (RCT) will be conducted based on full&#xD;
      implementation of the adapted curriculum by collaborating agencies with the support of U of&#xD;
      MN Extension. Training will be designed and implemented among community partner and U of MN&#xD;
      Extension staff who will be implementing the program at local sites.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The RCT will be implemented at two organizations in each of years 2, 3 and 4 in a staggered&#xD;
      fashion. In year 5, data will be analyzed, reports developed, papers written and submitted&#xD;
      for publication, and results will be reported back to community collaborators (organizations&#xD;
      and individuals).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Compared to a delayed-treatment control group at immediate post-course and 3 months&#xD;
           post-course, statistically significant changes will be observed in the home food and&#xD;
           physical activity environment and frequency of related paternal and maternal parenting&#xD;
           practices (making fruits, vegetables, and opportunities for physical activity more&#xD;
           available and sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs), sweets, salty snacks, fast food and&#xD;
           opportunities for sedentary behaviors less available; role modeling of positive EBRBs,&#xD;
           setting expectations and rules related to improvements in EBRBs, and increased frequency&#xD;
           of parent-youth communication regarding youth EBRBs).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Compared to a delayed-treatment control group at immediate post-course and 3 months&#xD;
           post-course, youth in the treatment group will have statistically significant&#xD;
           improvements in EBRBs including increased fruit and vegetable intake, increased physical&#xD;
           activity, lower intake of SSBs, sweets, salty snacks and fast food, decreased screen&#xD;
           time/sedentary time, and stable weight status.&#xD;
