    <textblock>
      This study is being done to determine if treatment with azacitidine and venetoclax is&#xD;
      effective treatment for elderly patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) who have not&#xD;
      received previous treatment. Azacitidine and venetoclax will be given as induction treatment&#xD;
      followed by venetoclax maintenance treatment for patients who respond to the induction&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This is a phase 2 study for elderly patients who have not received previous treatment for&#xD;
      acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Up to 42 patients will be enrolled. All patients will be&#xD;
      treated with azacitidine and venetoclax until a minimal residual disease (MRD) negative&#xD;
      response is achieved. Once patients achieve a MRD negative composite response, azacitidine&#xD;
      will be discontinued and venetoclax dose will be decreased to &quot;maintenance&quot; dose.&#xD;
