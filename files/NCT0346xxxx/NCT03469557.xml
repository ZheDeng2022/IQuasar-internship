  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 2, multi-cohort study to investigate safety, PK, and preliminary anti-tumor&#xD;
      activity of the monoclonal antibody BGB A317 in combination with standard chemotherapy as&#xD;
      first-line treatment. Cohorts include an ESCC cohort and a gastric carcinoma (GC) or GEJ&#xD;
      carcinoma cohort that will be enrolled concurrently. The study includes a screening (up to 28&#xD;
      days), treatment (until disease progression, intolerable toxicity, or treatment withdrawal&#xD;
      for another reason), safety follow-up (up to 30 days following last study drug treatment),&#xD;
      and survival follow-up phase.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study includes an initial phase during which 6 subjects will be enrolled in each cohort&#xD;
      (ESCC and GC/GEJ carcinoma). Safety data will be reviewed by a Safety Monitoring Committee&#xD;
      (SMC) after the first 6 subjects in a cohort have completed at least 1 cycle (21 days) of&#xD;
      treatment. During the initial phase, subjects who discontinue for a reason unrelated to&#xD;
      safety before completing Cycle 1 will be replaced. If there are no new, significant or&#xD;
      severe, safety signals detected, the enrollment will be expanded up to approximately 15&#xD;
      subjects per cohort (treatment expansion). During the treatment expansion, subjects will not&#xD;
      be replaced for any reason.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the ESCC cohort, subjects will be treated with BGB A317 200 mg IV on Day 1, cisplatin 80&#xD;
      mg/m² IV on Day 1, and 5-FU 800 mg/m²/day IV using continuous pumping system on Days 1&#xD;
      through 5 during each 21-day cycle. Cisplatin and 5-FU will be given for up to 6 cycles and&#xD;
      BGB A317 will be administered until disease progression, intolerable toxicity, or treatment&#xD;
      discontinuation for any other reason.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the GC and GEJ carcinoma cohort, subjects will be treated with BGB A317 200 mg IV on Day&#xD;
      1, oxaliplatin 130 mg/m² IV on Day 1, and capecitabine 1000 mg/m² orally twice daily (bid)&#xD;
      Days 1 through 14 (14 days total) during each 21-day cycle. Oxaliplatin will be administered&#xD;
      for up to 6 cycles and capecitabine and BGB A317 will be administered until disease&#xD;
      progression, intolerable toxicity, or treatment discontinuation for any other reason.&#xD;
