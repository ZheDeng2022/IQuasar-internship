  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study aims to develop scans that tell the investigators about the oxygen content of&#xD;
      tumours using Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and seeing whether regions of low oxygen&#xD;
      content are related to mutations in cancer genes such as TP53. MRI is a method of obtaining&#xD;
      pictures of inside of the body that shows the appearance and structure of soft tissues.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To get the information about the oxygen content of tumours, MRI is carried out while&#xD;
      breathing 100% oxygen. The variation of oxygen supply to different regions of the tumour will&#xD;
      help the investigators to predict tumour behavior and tumour response to treatment.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cancer tissue harbours a multitude of genetic alterations, and it is well-established that&#xD;
      when certain key alterations develop, they are powerful determinants of tumour behaviour&#xD;
      (growth rate, potential to spread). One of the most sinister and well-recognized alterations&#xD;
      is in a gene called TP53. Another feature of tumours that results in resistance to treatment&#xD;
      and poor outcome is a low oxygen level within tumour tissue. However, whether alterations in&#xD;
      TP53 are driven by low oxygen levels is not established.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Endometrial cancer is a good model to study the relationship between low tumour oxygen levels&#xD;
      and alterations in TP53 within tumour. Firstly, it is a common gynaecological malignancy,&#xD;
      (9,300 new cases annually in the UK) with two recognized types based on the appearance and&#xD;
      behaviour of the tumour. In type I (endometrioid and mucinous carcinomas), alterations in&#xD;
      TP53 are uncommon (15%), while in type II (serous and clear cell carcinomas) they are common&#xD;
      (88%). In-line with this, the survival of patients with Type 2 cancer is worse. Secondly,&#xD;
      endometrial cancer is routinely assessed at diagnosis using Magnetic Resonance Imaging. This&#xD;
      non-invasive scanning technique can be manipulated to derive additional information about the&#xD;
      oxygen status of the whole tumour and regions within it. Finally, the primary management of&#xD;
      endometrial cancer is surgical and involves hysterectomy. This means it is possible to obtain&#xD;
      fresh tumour tissue at the time of surgery from regions that have been identified on imaging&#xD;
      as having low vs.high levels of oxygen and to establish their TP53 status. In this study,&#xD;
      therefore, the investigator will establish the regional oxygen distribution within&#xD;
      endometrial cancers at diagnosis, and relate them to the alterations in TP53 from fresh&#xD;
      tissue samples from selected regions using gene sequencing. Understanding how highly&#xD;
      deleterious mutations arise in cancer might provide new avenues for intervention and control.&#xD;
