  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients undergoing Mohs micrographic surgery (MMS) frequently experience anxiety. It has&#xD;
      been suggested that enhanced patient education prior to the procedure may decrease patient&#xD;
      anxiety. The purpose of the study is to investigate if optimized participant education&#xD;
      enhances participant understanding, decreases participant anxiety and increases participant&#xD;
      satisfaction.&#xD;

      1. To investigate if participant education with a 3 dimensional printed (3DP) MMS model and&#xD;
           standardized script protocol increases participant understanding of MMS more than&#xD;
           current standard of care (control group) at the University Hospitals Cleveland Medical&#xD;
           Center MMS Clinics.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To investigate if participant education with a 3DP MMS model and standardized script&#xD;
           protocol decreases perioperative participant anxiety during MMS more than current&#xD;
           standard of care (control group) at the University Hospitals Cleveland Medical Center&#xD;
           MMS Clinics.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To evaluate if participant satisfaction with a 3DP MMS model and standardized script&#xD;
           protocol increases participant satisfaction during MMS more than current standard of&#xD;
           care (control group) at the University Hospitals Cleveland Medical Center MMS Clinics.&#xD;

    <measure>Percent of Correct and Incorrect Mohs Quiz Responses</measure>
    <time_frame>Post surgery (1 day)</time_frame>
    <description>This is an in-house-designed, short questionnaire with 6 multiple choice objective questions related to the participant's understanding of Mohs. A higher percentage of correct answers indicate a better understanding of Mohs.&#xD;
Reported data are percent of responses answered correctly and incorrectly totaled across all participants in each arm</description>

    <measure>Change in State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) Y-1 (State Anxiety) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>From baseline to post surgery (1 day)</time_frame>
    <description>The STAI is a well-known, frequently used measure of patient anxiety within the clinical setting. This form consists of two forms to assess state anxiety (Y-1) and a participant's baseline trait anxiety (Y-2).&#xD;
The Y-1 form consists of 20 Likert-type questions with scores ranging from 20 to 80, with higher scores indicating higher anxiety. Reported values are change in &quot;state anxiety' (post-stage minus baseline)</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Visual Analog Scale (VAS) Anxiety Score</measure>
    <time_frame>From baseline to post surgery (1 day)</time_frame>
    <description>The VAS is a frequently employed Likert-type scale that is used to measure anxiety. This 0-10 scale documents the patients current state of anxiety, with higher scores indicating worse anxietey, and can be answered by patients with an average reading level. Estimated time of completion is under 30 seconds. This form has been used in 2 studies to date and previously by experimental team to assess intraoperative anxiety in Mohs.</description>

    <measure>Change in Visual Analog Scale (VAS) Understanding Score</measure>
    <time_frame>From baseline to post surgery (1 day)</time_frame>
    <description>The VAS is a frequently employed Likert-type scale that because of the ease of use this tool has been converted to assess other objective measures including understanding. This 0-10 scale documents the participant's current state of understanding, with higher scores indicating better understanding, and can be answered by patients with an average reading level. Estimated time of completion is under 30 seconds. This form has been used by experimental team to assess intraoperative understanding in Mohs.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Satisfaction Survey Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Post surgery (1 day)</time_frame>
    <description>Participants were provided 3 subjective questions related to their satisfaction with the explanation of MMS that they received. This scale included questions regarding satisfaction with their explanation of the MMS procedure, if the explanation used could be improved, and if they recommended other patients be provided a similar explanation of MMS, with each question scored from 1 to 5, with higher scores indicating greater satisfaction. Total score range is 0 to 15, with higher scores indicating greater satisfaction.</description>

        <description>The VAS is a frequently employed Likert-type scale that because of the ease of use this tool has been converted to assess other objective measures including understanding. This 0-10 scale documents the participant's current state of understanding, with higher scores indicating better understanding, and can be answered by patients with an average reading level. Estimated time of completion is under 30 seconds. This form has been used by experimental team to assess intraoperative understanding in Mohs.</description>
