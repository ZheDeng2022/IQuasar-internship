  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall goal of this study is to identify a safe dose of metformin, in combination with&#xD;
      oligomeric procyanidin complex (OPC) for pharmacologic reduction of AGE levels in patients&#xD;
      with prostate cancer.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      AGEs (advanced glycation endpoints) are a type of metabolite, or substance, found in the&#xD;
      food. The AGE content in food is determined by the types of food you eat and also how you&#xD;
      prepare your food. The researchers helping conduct this study have found a potential link&#xD;
      between AGE levels and cancer. The purpose of this study is to identify safe pharmaceutical&#xD;
      agents that can reduce the AGE levels in subjects with advanced cancer.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Confirmation of adenocarcinoma of the prostate that is documented by one of the&#xD;
             following: pathology report or clinic note with documented history of prostate cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Subjects must be receiving ADT with a GnRH agonist or antagonist, with or without an&#xD;

             enrollment. Subjects whose ADT is interrupted may enroll or continue on study as long&#xD;
             as the testosterone is documented to remain &lt;50ng/dL for the entire duration of study&#xD;
             participation. Subjects who have undergone orchiectomy are also eligible.&#xD;
