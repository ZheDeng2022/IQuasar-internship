      A Phase 1 Dose Escalation and Expanded Cohort Study Of PF-06821497 In The Treatment Of Adult&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open label, multi center, Phase 1 dose escalation and dose expansion study of&#xD;
      PF-06821497 administered orally BID as a single agent or in combination with SOC to patients&#xD;
      with CRPC, SCLC, and FL. Part 1A will evaluate safety and target modulation of PF-06821497&#xD;
      monotherapy in patients with SCLC, FL and CRPC. PF-06821497 will be administered as&#xD;
      monotherapy in patients with FL in Part 1B dose escalation and to patients with CRPC in Part&#xD;
      1C dose escalation. For Part 2A (dose escalation combination therapy), PF-06821497 will be&#xD;
      administered in combination with SOC in patients with CRPC and SCLC. For Part 2B (dose&#xD;
      expansion), patients with mCRPC will be randomized (1:1 ratio) to receive either SOC or&#xD;
      PF-06821497 in combination with SOC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In dose escalation, a modified toxicity probability interval (mTPI) dose finding design will&#xD;
      be applied in 2-4 patient cohorts. Once the safety and adequate target modulation has been&#xD;
      established in Part 1A, Parts 1B and 2A of the trial will be initiated. Part 1C (monotherapy&#xD;
      dose escalation) will determine the MTD of single agent PF-06821497 in patients with mCRPC.&#xD;
      Part 2A (escalation RP2D finding for combination) will determine the MTD of the combination&#xD;
      with SOC in patients with CRPC. Part 2B (dose expansion) will assess the efficacy of&#xD;
      PF-06821497 at the RP2D in combination with SOC in patients with mCRPC in comparison to SOC&#xD;
      alone.&#xD;
