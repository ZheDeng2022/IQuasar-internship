  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Older people experience great difficulty understanding speech, especially accented English,&#xD;
      and this problem is expected to increase with the influx of immigrants who provide services&#xD;
      to the elderly population. The research examines the underlying factors that contribute to&#xD;
      older listeners' difficulty understanding accented speech, including those associated with&#xD;
      age-related hearing loss, changes in processing in auditory pathways in the brain, and&#xD;
      general cognitive decline. The investigation also evaluates the efficacy of training&#xD;
      strategies to improve understanding of accented English by older people. Outcomes of this&#xD;
      research are expected to improve communication between senior citizens and those with whom&#xD;
      they interact daily, and thereby improve quality of life for the older segment of the&#xD;
      Nation's population.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This research program in speech perception and auditory psychophysics examines the hypothesis&#xD;
      that many of the predominant difficulties in speech understanding of elderly listeners are&#xD;
      related to underlying problems in auditory temporal processing. One form of degraded speech&#xD;
      that is particularly difficult for elderly listeners to perceive is accented English.&#xD;
      Alterations of speech stress and timing with accent may be viewed as a form of degradation in&#xD;
      temporal aspects of speech prosody, and this type of temporal distortion is the focus of&#xD;
      investigation in the next project period. Moreover, psychoacoustic results demonstrate that&#xD;
      large age-related difficulties in temporal processing exist for the perception of auditory&#xD;
      tempo and rhythmic characteristics of sequential stimulus patterns featuring a stressed tone.&#xD;
      Listener processing difficulty could be attributed to peripheral and/or central processing&#xD;
      mechanisms, as well as various cognitive factors, including the degree of familiarity with&#xD;
      prosodic features of different native languages. The project examines the relative&#xD;
      contribution of peripheral hearing impairment, type of stimulus temporal complexity and&#xD;
      cognitive demand, and the linguistic background experience of listeners on the processing of&#xD;
      temporal prosody cues in speech and non-speech stimulus patterns. The project associated with&#xD;
      this clinical trial examines the efficacy of auditory training paradigms with stimuli that&#xD;
      feature temporal contrasts for improving perception of accented English and non-speech&#xD;
      sequences by older people. The research described in this application seeks to address one&#xD;
      goal outlined by the National Institute on Aging: to develop effective interventions to&#xD;
      maintain health and function and prevent or reduce the burden of age-related diseases,&#xD;
      disorders, and disabilities. The approach in this research program involves (a) an assessment&#xD;
      of the problems encountered in daily activities by the elderly population, (b) an analysis of&#xD;
      specific task demands in relation to individual capabilities, and (c) basic research on&#xD;
      sensory and perceptual changes with age and on the ameliorating effects of emerging&#xD;
      technologies (including rehabilitation). This three-dimensional approach is expected to&#xD;
      further progress toward improving communication and health-related quality of life for senior&#xD;
      citizens.&#xD;
