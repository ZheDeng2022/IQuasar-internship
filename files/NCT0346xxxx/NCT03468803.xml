  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Candida species are both known to colonize physiologically mucosal surfaces in the human body&#xD;
      without causing signs or symptoms of infection and to cause a wide variety of diseases,&#xD;
      including mucocutaneous infections and potentially fatal invasive infections of the&#xD;
      bloodstream or organs. Throughout the past decades, invasive fungal infections (IFIs) are of&#xD;
      increasing importance even in non-neutropenic patients who are in need of treatment in&#xD;
      intensive care units (ICU) or have undergone major surgeries. Several factors like parenteral&#xD;
      nutrition, central venous catheters, broad spectrum antibiotics admission, disturbance of&#xD;
      gastrointestinal mucosa integrity have been associated with an increased incidence of IFIs.&#xD;
      Positive testing for 1,3-ß-D-Glucan (BDG) in serum is widely used to assess invasive fungal&#xD;
      infections. It detects circulating BDG, which is part of the fungal cell wall of clinical&#xD;
      relevant fungi such as Candida spp. and Aspergillus spp..&#xD;
&#xD;
      The issue of BDG kinetics after intestinal mucosal damage (e.g. mucositis or gut surgery) is&#xD;
      poorly understood. Intestinal mucosal damage is characterized by a loss of integrity of the&#xD;
      intestinal mucosal barrier and increasing translocations of bacterial and/or fungal&#xD;
      commensals of the gastrointestinal tract.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In abdominal surgery a key concern in serum BDG kinetics is the potential introduction of BDG&#xD;
      from surgical sponges and gauze or mucosal damage due to surgical damage of the mucosal&#xD;
      integrity. Compared to open abdominal surgery in laparoscopic abdominal surgery sponges and&#xD;
      gauze are rarely used. As life-threatening intraabdominal candidiasis occurs in 30 to 40% of&#xD;
      high-risk abdominal surgical intensive care unit (ICU) patients it is of utmost importance to&#xD;
      obtain reliable BDG values for diagnosis or exclusion of invasive candidiasis.&#xD;
