  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study evaluates psychophysical measures of pain inhibition and facilitation, along with&#xD;
      cortical responses to different sensory stimuli, in patients with recurrent low back pain and&#xD;
      matched healthy individuals.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Pain inhibitory and facilitatory mechanisms have been suggested to play a role in the&#xD;
      development of persistent low back pain; however, there is still debate on when changes in&#xD;
      these mechanisms occur. Similarly, evoked cortical responses can reflect neuroplastic changes&#xD;
      in pain processing regions, which are also thought to play a role in the transition to&#xD;
      persistent pain, but there is also debate on when these neuroplastic changes develop relative&#xD;
      to low back pain. Therefore, this study will use patients with an intermediary clinical pain&#xD;
      state, recurrent low back pain, and matched healthy control participants, to investigate&#xD;
      within and between subject differences in pain inhibitory, facilitatory and neuroplastic&#xD;
      mechanisms.&#xD;
