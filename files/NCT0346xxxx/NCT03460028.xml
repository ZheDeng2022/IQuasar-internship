    <textblock>
      This randomized controlled trial will evaluate a yoga intervention for individuals who&#xD;
      experience persistent pain following oncology surgery. The integrated yoga program will&#xD;
      involve postures, breathing exercises, and concentration practices. Data will be collected at&#xD;
      several time points (pre-, mid-, and post-intervention) for both the intervention and&#xD;
      wait-list control conditions. The data will be analysed using linear mixed effects growth&#xD;
      models. Results will be written up in manuscript format, published in a peer review journal,&#xD;
      and disseminated at scientific research conferences.&#xD;
