      Rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) stands for the most frequent soft tissue sarcoma in children and,&#xD;
      adolescents and young adults (AYA, 15-25-year-old population), accounting for approximately&#xD;
      half of the whole soft tissue sarcomas in these populations.. Conversely, RMS represents a&#xD;
      very small proportion of the soft tissue sarcomas in adults (3%), that is less than 1% of all&#xD;
      solid cancers of adults.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To date, previous studies undertaken among the paediatric population have pointed out several&#xD;
      prognostic factors such as tumor localisation, tumor invasiveness at diagnosis, tumor size,&#xD;
      histological subset, and treatment plans. Age at diagnosis remains an independent prognostic&#xD;
      factor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RMS management is consensual in Europe for paediatric population, essentially based on the&#xD;
      protocol RMS 2005 within the framework of the European Paediatric Soft tissue sarcoma Study&#xD;
      Group (EpSSG). Care in AYAs remain heterogeneous and are either achieved in paediatric&#xD;
      department, according to EpSSG guidelines, or in oncology department, known as &quot;adult unit&quot;,&#xD;
      depending on ESMO (European Society for Medical Oncology), which are non-specific&#xD;
      recommendations for the management of rhabdomyosarcoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      No consensus has been published yet for RMS in AYA despite the growing interest in cancers in&#xD;
      AYA population - topic.supported by the French National Cancer Institute (INCa) - and the&#xD;
      increasing network between paediatricians and adult-oncologists. Thus management of RMS in&#xD;
      AYA remains patchy/unequal depending on the type of care unit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Herein, with the support of the Oscar Lambret Center, we aim at assessing and identifying&#xD;
      clinico-biological prognostic factors of rhabdomyosarcoma in AYA. Eventually, we hope to&#xD;
      offer a standardized treatment to this population. Data collected from medical file will be&#xD;
      anonymised in a confidential database of which the recipient is the sponsor of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The ancillary study will aim at characterizing the molecular profile of the&#xD;
      difficult-to-classify RMS subtypes (fusiform or pleomorphic subsets) in molecular biology for&#xD;
      ambiguous cases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      From a scientific point of view, this study aims at understanding the parameters that may&#xD;
      influence the prognosis of RMS in AYAs by evaluating various clinical and biological factors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Biologically, molecular profiling of RMS in AYA may improve the characterization of this&#xD;
      tumour in this age group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the clinical level, the completeness of the data collected will lead to a better&#xD;
      description of RMS in AYAs. We hope to harmonize their therapeutic management by providing&#xD;
      therapeutic adjustments according to population subsets.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Finally, these results could also help to adapt the therapeutic management of AYAs within the&#xD;
      framework of the European protocol that is currently under construction, and will involve&#xD;
      both children and adults.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) is a rare tumor, with an incidence rate estimated at 4.5-6.9/1,000,000&#xD;
      in paediatric and, adolescent and young adult (AYA, 15 -25 years old) populations. RMS stands&#xD;
      for the most frequent soft tissue sarcoma in children and adolescents, accounting for&#xD;
      approximately half of the whole soft tissue sarcomas in these populations. Conversely, RMS&#xD;
      represents a very small proportion of the soft tissue sarcomas in adults (3%), that is less&#xD;
      than 1% of the solid cancers of the adult. To date, previous studies undertaken among the&#xD;
      paediatric population have pointed out several prognostic factors such as tumor localisation,&#xD;
      tumor invasiveness at diagnosis, tumor size, histological subset, and treatment plans. Age at&#xD;
      diagnosis remains an independent prognostic factor. MYOD1 gene expression profile, more&#xD;
      common in AYA, also seems to impair the prognosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RMS management is consensual in Europe for paediatric population, essentially based on the&#xD;
      protocol RMS 2005 within the framework of the European Paediatric Soft tissue sarcoma Study&#xD;
      Group (EpSSG). Care in AYAs remain heterogeneous and are either achieved in paediatric&#xD;
      department, according to EpSSG guidelines, or in oncology department, known as &quot;adult unit&quot;,&#xD;
      depending on ESMO (European Society for Medical Oncology), which are non-specific&#xD;
      recommendations for the management of rhabdomyosarcoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      No consensus has been published yet for RMS in AYA despite the growing interest in cancers in&#xD;
      AYA population - topic.supported by the French National Cancer Institute (INCa) - and the&#xD;
      increasing network between paediatricians and adult-oncologists. Thus management of RMS in&#xD;
      AYA remains patchy/unequal depending on the type of care unit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Principal study&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the prognostic value in terms of Progression Free Survival (PFS), in AYA&#xD;
           patients with RMS, of clinical factors known as prognostic in children, and of&#xD;
           biological factors (MYOD1 mutation in non-alveolar tumor; FOXO1).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To describe clinical, histological and biological characteristics of RMS in AYA.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To describe the therapeutic strategy according to the type of department (pediatric, AYA&#xD;
           or adults):&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the impact on PFS of treatment strategy&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To estimate the Overall Survival (OS) in AYA with RMS&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To estimate the OS curve after relapse for patients who achieved complete remission&#xD;
           during first line of treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exploratory study Molecular profiling of RMS with the following subtypes: with fusiform cells&#xD;
      (Embryonal RMS with fusiform cells vs adult RMS with fusiform cells or sclerosing) or&#xD;
      pleomorphic (Embryonal RMS with anaplasia vs adult pleomorphic RMS) by RNAseq, and by CGH for&#xD;
      ambiguous cases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology Clinical data from the different databases will be merged using a standardized&#xD;
      format.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A pathology review of the slides is planned as well as a molecular characterization in&#xD;
      borderline cases and unusual subtypes. MYOD1 mutations and molecular profile will be&#xD;
      investigated for embryonal RMS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient and treatment characteristics will be described with median, range, mean and standard&#xD;
      deviation for continuous variables and in terms of frequency and percent of each modality for&#xD;
      categorical variables.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PFS will be estimated using Kaplan-Meier method from diagnosis until relapse, progression or&#xD;
      death from any cause. Patients alive without progression will be censored at the date of last&#xD;
      news.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OS will be estimated using Kaplan-Meier method from diagnosis until death from any cause.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OS after relapse will be estimated using Kaplan-Meier method from the date of first relapse&#xD;
      until the death whatever the cause. Patients alive will be censored at the date of last news.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prognostic factors of PFS will be analyzed using Cox models after check of the proportional&#xD;
      hazard assumption. The following factors will be evaluated:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  age: continuous or 15-18 vs 18-25&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  tumor size: ≤ 5cm vs &gt; 5cm&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  primary tumor site according to the EPSSG classification: favorable (orbit, head and non&#xD;
           parameningeal neck, paratesticular, vagina, uterus) vs unfavorable (head and&#xD;
           parameningeal, vesico -prostatic, limb, other)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  IRS stage for primary tumor&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  nodal and metastatic involvement at diagnostic&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  histology (alveolar vs embryonic vs pleomorphic vs other)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  PAX3-FOXO1 and PAX7-FOXO1 fusion gene status, MYOD1 mutation The impact of treatment&#xD;
           intervention on PFS will be evaluated using a Cox model stratified or adjusted over&#xD;
           prognostic factors identified at the previous step.&#xD;
