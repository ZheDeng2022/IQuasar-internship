    <textblock>
      This is a randomized trial to determine the effectiveness of a clinical decision support tool&#xD;
      on image ordering for patients with suspected nephrolithiasis. Patients who present with&#xD;
      acute unilateral flank or abdominal pain in whom emergency department providers suspect&#xD;
      nephrolithiasis will receive either the clinical decision support tool or no tool (usual&#xD;
      care).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      CT scan is overused for patients who present to the ED with suspected nephrolithiasis (acute&#xD;
      flank or abdominal pain). The investigators have developed a clinical decision support (CDS)&#xD;
      tool to identify those patients in whom ultrasound is appropriate. The CDS tool is based on&#xD;
      the Study of Ultrasonography vs. Computed Tomography for Suspected Nephrolithiasis in the&#xD;
      Emergency Department.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goal of this study is to assess the effectiveness of a clinical decision support (CDS)&#xD;
      tool to improve advanced imaging for suspected nephrolithiasis in the ED. The investigators&#xD;
      hypothesize those randomized to receiving the CDS tool will receive CT less often (and less&#xD;
      radiation) compared to those receiving control. Also, the investigators hypothesize those&#xD;
      randomized to receiving CDS will have a similar ED length of stay and rate of unexpected ED&#xD;
      return as those receiving control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design: Randomized trial of a CDS tool embedded in the electronic health record for&#xD;
      patients with suspected nephrolithiasis. The study will be conducted at UCSF Department of&#xD;
      Emergency Medicine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study subjects: The investigators will enroll adult patients who present to the UCSF ED who&#xD;
      present with &quot;suspected nephrolithiasis&quot;, which is defined as those with symptoms of&#xD;
      nephrolithiasis for whom an ED provider orders a CT scan for suspected nephrolithiasis.&#xD;
      Symptoms of nephrolithiasis include acute unilateral flank and/or abdominal pain, typically&#xD;
      described as severe and colicky. The pain is accompanied by nausea, vomiting, and urinary&#xD;
      symptoms, such as hematuria. The CT imaging studies emergency physicians typically order for&#xD;
      suspected nephrolithiasis include CT scan without contrast; however a substantial minority of&#xD;
      patients receive CT scan with contrast, and CT scan with and without contrast for acute flank&#xD;
      pain, suspected nephrolithaisis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sampling, recruiting and retaining subjects: The investigators will enroll consecutive&#xD;
      patients who present to the ED with the selection criteria. Those with suspected&#xD;
      nephrolithiasis but have an exclusion criteria will be recorded and compared to those who&#xD;
      were enrolled. Eligible patients will be randomized to either receiving CDS recommendations&#xD;
      or no CDS recommendations. Subjects will not receive informed consent, and will not be&#xD;
      contacted by staff.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention: The intervention is the CDS tool, which consists of 4 components:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Four questions which assess the appropriateness of ultrasound for this patient&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. A link to the evidence&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Buttons to remove CT scan and order ultrasound&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. If the CT scan order is kept, reasons why ultrasonography is not appropriate&#xD;
&#xD;
      The CDS tool will be placed or integrated into EPIC, at the point of order entry. The tool&#xD;
      will be triggered by an order for CT to identify or rule out kidney stone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Co-primary outcomes: Proportion of study arm who receive CT, and radiation dose. Proportion&#xD;
      of study arm who receive CT is defined as #CT scans ordered/#patients in study arm. Radiation&#xD;
      dose will be reported as median radiation dose in mSv. The secondary outcomes will include&#xD;
      proportion of patients with an unscheduled return due to missed diagnosis, cost, ED length of&#xD;
      stay.&#xD;
