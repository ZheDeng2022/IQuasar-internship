      Background Postpartum haemorrhage (PPH) is a major cause of maternal mortality worldwide&#xD;
      accounting for 25% of maternal deaths. In Zimbabwe PPH is the second most common cause of&#xD;
      death. Tranexamic acid (TXA) is widely used to reduce blood loss in elective surgery,&#xD;
      bleeding trauma patients, and menorrhagia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators seek to determine the efficacy of TXA in reducing PPH during and after&#xD;
      elective caesarean section.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods and Design The investigators intend to perform an open label randomized control study&#xD;
      of 1,162 women who are undergoing elective caesarean section. The participants will be&#xD;
      randomly selected to receive an intravenous infusion of TXA 10 minutes prior to skin incision&#xD;
      or not to receive the intervention. Prophylactic oxytocin will be administered to all the&#xD;
      women.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome will be incidence of PPH defined by blood loss equal to or more than&#xD;
      1,000ml calculated by determining the difference in haematocrit values taken prior to and 48&#xD;
      hours after caesarean section.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Discussion In addition to prophylactic uterotonic administration, TXA is a complementary&#xD;
      component acting on the haemostatic process that can be used in the third stage of labour to&#xD;
      prevent PPH. It is a promising intervention that is cheap, easy to administer and would be&#xD;
      easy to add to routine delivery protocols in hospitals. It would also help to conserve&#xD;
      precious resources by reducing the need for blood products, and expensive surgical&#xD;
      interventions to manage PPH.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This large adequately powered randomized study seeks to determine the efficacy of TXA to&#xD;
      validate its routine use at caesarean section to prevent PPH.&#xD;

      RESEARCH QUESTION Does intravenous Tranexamic Acid (TXA) 10mg/kg plus Oxytocin 5&#xD;
      International Units (IU) result in a lower incidence of primary postpartum haemorrhage&#xD;
      compared to Oxytocin alone after elective caesarean section.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RATIONALE FOR THE RESEARCH Postpartum haemorrhage (PPH) is a major cause of maternal&#xD;
      mortality worldwide accounting for 25% of maternal deaths. In Zimbabwe, PPH is the second&#xD;
      most common cause of death. Tranexamic acid (TXA) is widely used to reduce blood loss in&#xD;
      elective surgery, bleeding trauma patients, and menorrhagia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to prophylactic uterotonic administration, TXA is a complementary component&#xD;
      acting on the haemostatic process that can be used in the third stage of labour to prevent&#xD;
      PPH. It is a promising intervention that is cheap, easy to administer and would be easy to&#xD;
      add to routine delivery protocols in hospitals. It would also help to conserve precious&#xD;
      resources by reducing the need for blood products, and expensive surgical interventions to&#xD;
      manage PPH.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators seek to determine the efficacy of TXA in reducing PPH during and after&#xD;
      elective caesarean section.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RESEARCH OBJECTIVES&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To assess the impact of TXA (10mg/kg) given 10 minutes prior to elective caesarean&#xD;
           section on postpartum blood loss&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To assess the potential adverse effects of TXA given 10 minutes prior to elective&#xD;
           caesarean section Primary Outcome&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Incidence of PPH defined by blood loss equal to or exceeding 1000ml following&#xD;
                elective caesarean section Secondary Outcomes&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Estimated blood loss during caesarean section&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Need for blood transfusion&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Use of additional uterotonics (such as oxytocin infusion or prostaglandins)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  TXA side effects&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Incidence of emergency surgery for PPH&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Duration of mother's postnatal hospital stay&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Neonatal outcome RESEARCH METHODOLOGY Research Design The aim of this study is to&#xD;
                compare the effect of a low dose of TXA (10mg/kg) administered 10 minutes prior to&#xD;
                elective caesarean section with prophylactic oxytocin administration, versus&#xD;
                prophylactic oxytocin alone in an open label randomized clinical trial (RCT). An&#xD;
                RCT is appropriate as it aims to reduce bias when testing this potentially new&#xD;
                intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Target Population Women undergoing elective caesarean sections at Harare and Parirenyatwa&#xD;
      Hospitals based on set inclusion and exclusion criteria Inclusion criteria Pregnant woman&#xD;
      with signed informed consent, who understand English and/or Shona, at estimated gestational&#xD;
      age of 38 weeks or older, requiring Elective Caesarean Section, with a live intrauterine&#xD;
      fetus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria Placental Abruption, emergency caesarean section, current or previous&#xD;
      history of significant disease including heart disease, liver, renal disorders; known&#xD;
      coagulopathy or history of deep venous thrombosis and/or pulmonary embolism, or arterial&#xD;
      thrombosis (angina pectoris, myocardial infarction, stroke); history of epilepsy or seizures;&#xD;
      autoimmune disease; sickle cell disease; severe haemorrhagic disease; intrauterine fetal&#xD;
      demise; eclampsia/HELLP syndrome; administration of anticoagulants - clexane or antiplatelet&#xD;
      agents in the week prior to delivery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample Size A total sample size of 1,162 (581 per group) was calculated assuming a proportion&#xD;
      of 2.1% PPH in the experimental group and 5.8% in the control group at 95% confidence&#xD;
      interval and 90% power using Fleiss formula.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects' state of physical health Healthy Intervention Participants receive either 10mg/kg&#xD;
      of TXA 10 minutes prior to elective caesarean section with prophylactic oxytocin&#xD;
      administration after delivery of the baby, versus prophylactic oxytocin alone after delivery&#xD;
      of the baby.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessment Questionnaire (attached). Vital signs (heart rate, blood pressure, respiratory&#xD;
      rate) noted before surgery, immediately after placental delivery, and 1 to 2 hours after&#xD;
      birth Full blood count (FBC), Urea &amp; electrolytes (u&amp;e) and liver function tests (LFTs)&#xD;
      performed a day before delivery (routinely performed) U&amp;e, LFTs and FBC assessed 48 hours&#xD;
      after delivery. Estimated blood loss (EBL) using the difference in hematocrit values taken&#xD;
      prior to and 48 hours after caesarean delivery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will also note the standard EBL based on estimates made by the anaesthetist&#xD;
      after assessment of patient's linen and abdominal swabs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RISKS AND BENEFITS The common adverse effects include headaches (50.4 - 60.4%), backaches&#xD;
      (20.7 - 31.4%), nasal sinus problem (25.4%), abdominal pain (12 - 19.8%), diarrhea (12.2%),&#xD;
      fatigue (5.2%) and anaemia (5.6%).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The WOMAN Trial collaborators found that TXA actually reduces mortality due to bleeding in&#xD;
      women with PPH with no adverse effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tranexamic acid potentiates the blood clotting system and is used to treat and prevent&#xD;
      bleeding. Use of TXA could potentially prevent PPH due to factors other than uterine atony,&#xD;
      where uterotonics will not be effective.&#xD;
&#xD;
      COSTS AND COMPENSATION Study participants will not receive any compensation. The cost of TXA&#xD;
      shall not be incurred by the study participants. They will bear their usual admission and&#xD;
      caesarean section costs that they would otherwise have borne had they not participated in the&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      INFORMED CONSENT All subjects or legally authorized representatives for minors are expected&#xD;
      to be give informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CONFIDENTIALITY ASSURANCES Information collected from the participants shall be confidential,&#xD;
      will be assigned a code and no personal identifiers will be used. Information collected will&#xD;
      be stored in a secure place only accessible to the researcher and assistants, as well as on a&#xD;
      password-protected laptop computer. Consent forms will be kept for three years after the&#xD;
      completion of the investigation unless stipulated otherwise by the Medical Research Council&#xD;
      of Zimbabwe.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CONFLICTS OF INTERESTS The study is being carried out in partial fulfillment of the degree of&#xD;
      Masters of Medicine in Obstetrics and Gynaecology. No other gains are to be obtained from&#xD;
      carrying out the study.&#xD;
