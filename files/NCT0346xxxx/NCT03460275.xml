  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Based on the existing research results, Osimertinibi is effective not only for patients with&#xD;
      sensitizing EGFR mutations, but also for other less common EGFR mutations. However, no&#xD;
      studies have been done so far regarding the difference in efficacy of various EGFR mutation&#xD;
      subtypes. Meanwhile, the presenting studies data of the safety and efficacy of Osimertinib as&#xD;
      first-line therapy for NSCLC is very limited. Therefore, this study aims at assessing the&#xD;
      safety and efficacy of Osimertinib as First-line therapy for patients with EGFR&#xD;
      mutation-positive locally advanced or Metastatic Non-squamous NSCLC as well as the its&#xD;
      difference in efficacy of various EGFR mutation subtypes.&#xD;
