  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Inherited epidermolysis bullosa (EB) is a genetic skin disorder characterized by skin&#xD;
      fragility and recurrent blister formation. More and more evidence has suggested that the skin&#xD;
      lesions initially caused by genetic mutations may be further aggravated by inflammatory&#xD;
      responses. Several reports showed successful alleviation of EB symptoms upon treatment with&#xD;
      immunomodulatory therapies. Modulation of proinflammatory cytokine IL-1β has shown promising&#xD;
      results in alleviating epidermolysis bullosa simplex (EBS), a major subtype of inherited EB,&#xD;
      by downregulating IL-1β-mediated JNK/MAPK signaling pathway. This data further supports the&#xD;
      potential of using cytokine modulators to treat EB.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AC-203, a topical formulation, can inhibit the production and activity of IL-1β,&#xD;
      down-regulate IL-1β receptors, and increase IL1β-receptor antagonist (IL1-Ra) expression. In&#xD;
      addition, AC-203 has been reported to inhibit anti-BP180 autoantibody-induced IL-6/IL-8&#xD;
      upregulation in cultured keratinocytes and LPS-induced IL-6 upregulation in cultured&#xD;
      macrophages. Furthermore, AC-203 was also found to inhibit the formation of NLRP3&#xD;
      inflammasome, which plays essential roles in induction of caspase-1-dependent pyroptosis and&#xD;
      release of inflammatory cytokines IL-1β and IL-18. These studies demonstrated the cytokine&#xD;
      modulatory properties of AC-203 and pointed out the possible application of AC-203 in a&#xD;
      variety of inflammatory diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is designed to test the efficacy, safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of&#xD;
      AC-203 ointment (vs. placebo) in patients with inherited EB.&#xD;
