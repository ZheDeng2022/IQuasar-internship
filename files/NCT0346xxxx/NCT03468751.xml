    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and recommended&#xD;
      Phase 2 dose (RP2D) of humanized anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibody, HLX10, in patients with&#xD;
      advanced or metastatic tumors refractory to standard therapy. This study will also evaluate&#xD;
      the pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, immunogenicity and anti-tumor effect of HLX10 and&#xD;
      explore the potential prognostic and predictive biomarkers.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The lack of immunologic control is currently recognized as one of the hallmarks of cancer.&#xD;
      The cancer immunoediting concept has been proposed as a mechanism by which tumors escape&#xD;
      control. The concept involves three phases: elimination (tumor cell eradication), equilibrium&#xD;
      (when editing of surviving tumor cells occurs) and escape (when the altered tumor cells&#xD;
      progress through the shield of the activated immune response).&#xD;
&#xD;
      When the TCR of a T cell recognizes antigens expressed in the context of the MHC, the immune&#xD;
      checkpoint modulates signaling: co-stimulatory molecules such as CD28 on T cells enhance the&#xD;
      signal, whereas co-inhibitory molecules suppress it. Recent research has implicated the&#xD;
      expression of immunoinhibitory checkpoints such as CTL antigen 4 (CTLA-4) and programmed&#xD;
      death protein 1 (PD-1) as potential mediators of the equilibrium and escape phases of cancer&#xD;
      immunoediting described above. These molecules are expressed on activated T cells, but when&#xD;
      they bind to ligands either on antigen-presenting cells (CTLA-4 binding to CD80/CD86) or&#xD;
      tumor cells (PD-1 binding to PD-L1), they tend to shut down the anti-tumor response. Efforts&#xD;
      to use antibodies to target and block these immuno-inhibitory interactions have ushered in a&#xD;
      new era of immunotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tumors display a wide variety of antigens that can potentially be exploited by harnessing the&#xD;
      adaptive immune response. The T-cell response to these antigens can be dysregulated by tumor&#xD;
      cells seeking to evade immunologic detection and destruction by hijacking physiological&#xD;
      homeostatic immune-checkpoint signaling pathways. In addition to a variety of mechanisms that&#xD;
      can create an immunosuppressive microenvironment (e.g. secretion of inhibitory cytokines,&#xD;
      presence of regulatory T cells), many tumor types also express PD-L1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nivolumab and pembrolizumab are the two anti-PD1 monoclonal antibodies currently approved for&#xD;
      multiple cancers. The application of nivolumab or pembrolizumab alone or in combination with&#xD;
      chemotherapy has completely changed cancer management.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HLX10 is a new monoclonal antibody targeting PD1 on T cells, developed from mouse hybridoma&#xD;
      technology. In vitro studies have demonstrated the growth inhibition of multiple cancer cell&#xD;
      lines, and shown growth inhibition of tumors in murine xenogeneic studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nonclinical studies dosing up to 50 mg/kg HLX10 weekly in cynomolgus monkeys for 13 weeks&#xD;
      have shown good tolerability without evident toxicities (please refer to Investigator's&#xD;
      Brochure). HLX10 shows cross-reactivity to both monkey and human PD1, but does not bind&#xD;
      rodent PD1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on the pharmacology studies and pharmacokinetic and toxicokinetic studies in cynomolgus&#xD;
      monkeys, this study is a phase-1 study to address the safety and tolerability of HLX10 in&#xD;
      patients with metastatic or recurrent cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HLX10 has not yet been tested in human. Therefore, the investigators propose this&#xD;
      first-in-human phase 1 study. In this study, the investigators intend to investigate the&#xD;
      safety, and tolerability of HLX10 in humans, and hope to identify the maximum tolerated dose&#xD;
      (MTD), and determine the recommended phase 2 dose in future study. At the same time, the&#xD;
      investigators would like to gain information of the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of&#xD;
      this drug and its potential immunogenicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To minimize the risk of patients who volunteer to receive this experimental drug, the&#xD;
      investigators will choose 0.1 mg/kg as the initial starting dose. The selection of starting&#xD;
      dose is based on the repeat-dose toxicology study on monkey, at 1/166 of the human equivalent&#xD;
      dose of No-Observed Adverse Effect Level (NOAEL) in cynomolgus studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To investigate the dose required to reach maximal effect, the investigators propose a dose&#xD;
      escalation sequence. The purpose of the dose escalation is to obtain the pharmacokinetics and&#xD;
      pharmacodynamics of HLX10 at different dose levels, and investigate its relationship with&#xD;
      adverse reactions. The investigators also intend to identify the MTD. The information from&#xD;
      the dose escalation is crucial to determine the optimal dose in future studies and potential&#xD;
      indications for HLX10.&#xD;
