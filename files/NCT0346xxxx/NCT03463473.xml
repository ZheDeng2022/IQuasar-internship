  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase I study to determine the safety and toxicity, PK/PD, immunogenicity,&#xD;
      biomarkers, anti-tumor activity and establish a preliminary recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D)&#xD;
      in subjects with advanced solid tumors.&#xD;

      This is a first-in-human (FIH), open-label, Phase 1 dose-Escalation Study of MSB2311, a&#xD;
      humanized anti-PD-L1 monoclonal antibody, in subjects with advanced solid tumors. Qualified&#xD;
      subjects will be enrolled to receive their assigned dose regimen of MSB2311 until disease&#xD;
      progression or intolerable toxicity, withdrawal of consent, or end of study, whichever occurs&#xD;
      first. The maximum treatment duration is 2 years. During the study, subjects will be&#xD;
      evaluated for safety and toxicity, PK/PD, immunogenicity, biomarkers, and anti-tumor activity&#xD;
      of MSB2311.&#xD;
