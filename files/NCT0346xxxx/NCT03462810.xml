      The goal of this compassionate use program is to provide a mechanism to supply Cabotegravir,&#xD;
      CAB on an individual named patient basis for treatment of individuals who have no available&#xD;
      treatment alternatives and/or limited treatment options (e.g., who are unable to participate&#xD;
      in the Phase III clinical studies or do not qualify), and are in need of new drugs to&#xD;
      construct an effective antiviral regimen and may require the use of parenterally administered&#xD;
      drug given underlying medical conditions. You can access ViiV's Policy on Compassionate via&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  HIV-infected patients will be eligible for treatment if ALL the following apply:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Male or female patients aged ≥ 18 yrs&#xD;
&#xD;
        NOTE: all female patients of reproductive potential should use every precaution to prevent&#xD;
        pregnancy including either complete abstinence from intercourse from 2 weeks prior to&#xD;
        administration of CAB, throughout receipt of CAB and for at least 52 weeks after&#xD;
        discontinuation of CAB LA; or use of one of the following methods of highly reliable&#xD;
        contraception:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Contraceptive subdermal implant&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Intrauterine device or intrauterine system&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Combined estrogen and progestogen oral contraceptive&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Injectable progestogen&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Contraceptive vaginal ring&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Percutaneous contraceptive patches&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Male partner sterilisation with documentation of azoospermia prior to the female&#xD;
             subject's entry into the study, and this male is the sole partner for that subject.&#xD;
             The documentation on male sterility can come from the site personnel's: review of&#xD;
             subject's medical records, medical examination and/or semen analysis, or medical&#xD;
             history interview provided by her or her partner.&#xD;
&#xD;
        These allowed methods of contraception are only effective when used consistently/correctly&#xD;
        and in accordance with the product label. The investigator is responsible for ensuring that&#xD;
        patients understand how to properly use these methods of contraception.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Inability to construct a viable antiviral treatment regimen with commercially&#xD;
             available medications;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Demonstrated need for a long acting, injectable antiretroviral including, but not&#xD;
             limited to malabsorption or inability to achieve adequate drug levels via oral route.&#xD;
             NOTE: Poor/incomplete adherence to oral meds is not a sufficient rationale for&#xD;
             inclusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The patient/legal guardian or representative has given informed consent to treatment&#xD;
             prior to administering CAB (in a manner consistent with all national requirements).&#xD;
             The patient/legal guardian or representative has also given informed consent for the&#xD;
             transmission of a copy of the anonymized adverse and serious adverse event (SAE) and&#xD;
             pregnancy reports (in compliance with local regulatory authority requirements) to GSK&#xD;
             and ViiV where allowable by local regulations, and to the country regulatory authority&#xD;
             as required.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients will not be eligible for treatment if ANY of the following apply:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Patient has estimated creatinine clearance &lt;50 mL/min via Cockcroft-Gault method;&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Females who are pregnant or women who are breastfeeding, or plan to become&#xD;
                  pregnant or breastfeed during treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Patients who have had known or suspected allergic reaction or hypersensitivity&#xD;
                  reactions to integrase inhibitors;&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) &gt;5 times the upper limit of normal (ULN)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  ALT ≥ 3 times ULN and bilirubin ≥ 1.5 times ULN (with &gt; 35% direct bilirubin)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Evidence for moderate to severe hepatic impairment, grade 3-4 liver fibrosis, or&#xD;
                  cirrhosis&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Patients who are eligible for actively enrolling clinical trials involving CAB.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Significant coagulopathy precluding chronic IM dosing&#xD;
&#xD;
        NOTE: Patients should not be treated via the named patient/compassionate use program if&#xD;
        they are eligible and/or able to participate in any of the Phase III clinical trials of CAB&#xD;
        and the patient is suitable for participation in such clinical trials. In that instance&#xD;
        (assuming consent is obtained) the patient should preferentially be enrolled into the&#xD;
        ongoing clinical trial to allow detailed data collection. In accordance with national&#xD;
        requirements patients should not be treated in the named patient/compassionate use program&#xD;
        if they have responded to previous treatment with CAB in another clinical trial without&#xD;
        review and prior approval by the VSLC.&#xD;
