  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In response to the growing need for training on interventions to address first episode&#xD;
      psychosis, the Center for Social Innovation (C4) has partnered with experts in Coordinated&#xD;
      Specialty Care (CSC) to develop and test CSC OnDemand: An Innovative Online Learning Platform&#xD;
      for Implementing Coordinated Specialty Care. The product builds on the findings of the&#xD;
      Recovery After an Initial Schizophrenia Episode (RAISE) studies, funded by the National&#xD;
      Institute of Mental Health (NIMH). RAISE examined team-based models of care for people early&#xD;
      in the course of schizophrenia. Through a Fast Track Small Business Innovation Research&#xD;
      (SBIR) grant, investigators will prototype, test, refine, and evaluate the impact of CSC&#xD;
      OnDemand.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Building on existing resources and the expertise of our faculty and advisors, the&#xD;
      investigators will develop CSC OnDemand, a multifaceted online learning product that includes&#xD;
      four levels: 1) an online readiness tool and CSC Learning Hub; 2) dynamic multimedia core&#xD;
      curriculum on first episode psychosis and CSC; 3) live faculty-led online courses; and 4)&#xD;
      ongoing support, including an online community of practice to support peer-to-peer learning.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During Phases I and II of this Fast Track SBIR, the investigators will prototype, pilot test,&#xD;
      build out, and evaluate the product through a cluster randomized non-inferiority study&#xD;
      comparing it with InPerson training.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase I built a robust prototype of the online platform and test it with 15-20 providers from&#xD;
      three sites. This Phase will explore feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary&#xD;
      effectiveness of the product, and will examine which components of the online platform&#xD;
      providers find most useful.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on our findings from Phase I, the investigators will refine and fully build out the&#xD;
      product to test in a larger randomized trial. Phase II will use a cluster randomized&#xD;
      non-inferiority design to assess if OnDemand training (n = 20 sites) is comparable to&#xD;
      InPerson training (n = 10 sites). Using a mixed-methods approach, the investigators will&#xD;
      examine provider (n = 150) outcomes (satisfaction; knowledge gains/retention; attitudes&#xD;
      toward shared decision making) and client (n = 600) outcomes (work/school participation;&#xD;
      engagement in CSC services; inpatient psychiatric hospitalizations).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is guided by the following specific aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase II AIM 1: To refine, expand, and finalize CSC OnDemand based on Phase I findings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AIM 2: To determine if the OnDemand training intervention is as successful as the InPerson&#xD;
      intervention in increasing CSC providers knowledge and shared decision making (SDM).&#xD;
      Hypothesis: Providers in the OnDemand condition will achieve increases in knowledge, SDM and&#xD;
      satisfaction at post training and nine months that will be no more than .5 standard&#xD;
      deviations less than the InPerson condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AIM 3: To determine if the OnDemand training intervention is as successful as the InPerson&#xD;
      training in increasing participation in work or school, improving engagement in treatment,&#xD;
      and decreasing relapse rates for participating clients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: Clients being served by the providers in the OnDemand condition will have&#xD;
      work/school participation rates, levels of engagement and rates of hospitalization nine&#xD;
      months after admission that are no more than 10 percent higher (hospitalization) or lower&#xD;
      (work/school, engagement) than clients served by providers in the InPerson condition.&#xD;

    <description>CSC knowledge will be assessed with a 50-item, complex, multiple-choice test (25 common across disciplines, 25 discipline-specific), which will be created in conjunction with the intervention modules and will be piloted in Phase I. The outcome will be the percentage of correct responses.</description>

    <description>Shared Decision Making Questionnaire-physician version (SDM-Q-Doc) is a standardized brief instrument (9 items) for assessing SDM in clinical encounters. SDM-Q-Doc was developed for physicians, but has been adapted to all healthcare professionals. The instrument consists of 9 statements rated on a 6-point scale from &quot;completely disagree&quot; (0) to &quot;completely agree&quot; (5). The items are summed to create a total score.</description>
