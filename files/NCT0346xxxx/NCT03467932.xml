      This study is designed to explore the efficacy of ORMD-0801 when given in different regimens&#xD;
      across a dose range for up to 12 weeks in subjects with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM).&#xD;
      There are two cohorts in this study. Approximately 360 subjects with T2DM will initially&#xD;
      undergo a 2-week, single-blind placebo run-in period (Visits 1 and 2), followed by a 12-week&#xD;
      treatment period (Visits 3 through 9). Cohort A will enroll 285 subjects; Cohort B will&#xD;
      enroll 75 subjects&#xD;
&#xD;
      For 265 of the 285 subjects of Cohort A, the total 12-week treatment period will include a&#xD;
      Part 1&quot;dose escalation&quot; interval (2 weeks, Visits 3 and 4) and a Part 2 stable dose&#xD;
      &quot;maintenance&quot; interval (10 weeks, Visits 5 through 9).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, per FDA request, the remaining 20 subjects (of the cohort total of 285 enrolled&#xD;
      subjects) will receive excipient-matched placebo in a non-randomized single-blind fashion,&#xD;
      TID, according to the same schedule as described above.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For Cohort B (75 of the 360 total subjects), the total 12-week treatment period will include&#xD;
      a stable dosing period for both Part 1 (2 weeks, Visits 3 and 4) and Part 2 (10 weeks, Visits&#xD;
      5 through 9).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cohort A data will be analyzed after Cohort A data collection has been completed (last&#xD;
      subject for Cohort A screened on 7 May 2019). Estimated completion for Cohort A is October&#xD;
      2019. Cohort B data will be analyzed following the release of results from Cohort A.&#xD;

    <masking_description>Single-Blind Placebo Run-in (Masking will be with Participant):&#xD;
During the placebo run-in period, subjects will self- administer blinded placebo study medication at night prior to bedtime (@10 PM ± 90 min. each night, no sooner than 2 hrs. after dinner). Outpatient glycemic levels and adverse events will be measured using self-monitored blood glucose (SMBG) and recorded in a diary. Treatment Period (Masking will be Participant, Care Provider, Investigator, Outcomes Assessor) There are two Cohorts, A and B.&#xD;
Part 1 In the first 2 weeks of active treatment, subjects will receive double-blind therapy according to their randomized regimen (placebo or ORMD-0801) to be taken QHS, BID or TID.&#xD;
Part 2 Subjects will remain on fixed doses of ORMD-0801 or matched placebo for 10 weeks. Doses will not be adjusted unless clinically indicated for adverse events or hypoglycemia. Treatment arms will consist of subjects receiving ORMD-0801 QHS, ORMD-0801 BID and ORMD-0801 TID versus placebo.</masking_description>
