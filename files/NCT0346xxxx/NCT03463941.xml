  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to explore how working with a partner can influence&#xD;
      participation in a church wellness program. There are many different types of church wellness&#xD;
      programs. Church members are more likely to participate and achieve goals in these programs&#xD;
      when they have peer support. The researcher would like to know what African American men and&#xD;
      women think about working with a support partner. This information will help researchers&#xD;
      design better church wellness programs. The participants are being asked to take part in this&#xD;
      research because the investigators believe that it is helpful to share feelings and thoughts&#xD;
      about experiences working with a partner to achieve health goals. This knowledge will be used&#xD;
      to create church wellness programs that will help African American men and women prevent&#xD;
      disease and live healthier lives.&#xD;

    <description>Phase I: At baseline and at post-intervention, participant height, weight, BMI, fruit and vegetable intake and exercise habits will be measured. Participants will complete surveys and meet each week to learn about nutrition and exercise.&#xD;
Phase II: Dyads will attend a communication training session to discuss 1) benefits of working with a partner; 2) supportive communication tips; and 3) expected activities for the next 8 weeks, including filling out daily logs. After the training session, the dyads will work together to achieve their health goals. The dyads will return to the church for two check in sessions. At these sessions, participants will turn in their logs, and be weighed. At the end of the intervention, BMI will be reassessed, and surveys and interviews will be completed.</description>

          <description>Peer Support Dyad Intervention: Phase I: At baseline and at post-intervention, participant height, weight, BMI, fruit and vegetable intake and exercise habits will be measured. Participants will complete surveys and meet each week to learn about nutrition and exercise.&#xD;
Phase II: Dyads will attend a communication training session to discuss 1) benefits of working with a partner; 2) supportive communication tips; and 3) expected activities for the next 8 weeks, including filling out daily logs. After the training session, the dyads will work together to achieve their health goals. The dyads will return to the church for two check in sessions. At these sessions, participants will turn in their logs, and be weighed. At the end of the intervention, BMI will be reassessed, and surveys and interviews will be completed.</description>
