  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is the long term effect of severely distressing&#xD;
      traumatic event characterized by intrusive thoughts, nightmares, and avoidance. Brain imaging&#xD;
      of PTSD patients demonstrate alterations in regional brain perfusion, with stunned,&#xD;
      hypoperfused regions. Those brain-biological pathologies may be responsible for the limited&#xD;
      success rate of currently available interventions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the last years data regarding Hyperbaric Oxygen Therapy (HBOT) induced neuroplasticity&#xD;
      accumulated. A number of studies in traumatic brain injury, cerebrovascular attacks, and&#xD;
      fibromyalgia have presented evidence of improved perfusion and recovery of metabolic brain&#xD;
      tissues, accompanied by clinical improvement under HBOT even years after the acute insults.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Considerable evidence supports potential benefit of HBOT on PTSD, however, no clinical trial&#xD;
      was done on this pure PTSD population. The aim of the proposed study is to examine hyperbaric&#xD;
      oxygen therapy as a treatment for PTSD. Advanced brain imaging and functional analysis tools&#xD;
      will be used to evaluate treatment's effect.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) has been described as &quot;the complex somatic, cognitive,&#xD;
      affective, and behavioral effects of psychological trauma&quot;. PTSD is triggered by a severe&#xD;
      distressing traumatic event, in which an overwhelming amount of stress exceeds the ability of&#xD;
      the individual to cope or integrate the emotions involved in the experience. The fact that a&#xD;
      large portion of the affected population is previously healthy, young people who were thrown&#xD;
      off their life course, contribute to the great motivation for research in this field. But&#xD;
      unfortunately, the current available treatment improve some of the symptoms in only 32-66% of&#xD;
      patients, and even after treatment, up to 60% still meet PTSD diagnosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the last few years, there is growing knowledge regarding the neuro-biological changes that&#xD;
      characterize PTSD. Brain imaging demonstrates alterations in regional brain perfusion, with&#xD;
      stunning, hypoperfused regions. Those enduring brain-biological pathologies may explain the&#xD;
      limited success rate of currently available interventions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Accumulating studies presents evidence that hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT) can induce&#xD;
      neuroplasticity and recovery of metabolic injured brain tissues, even years after the acute&#xD;
      insults. HBOT can initiate several brain-repair related mechanisms including brain&#xD;
      angiogenesis; improve cerebral vascular flow enable regeneration of axonal white matter,&#xD;
      stimulate axonal growth, promote blood-brain barrier integrity and reduce inflammatory&#xD;
      reactions, as well as in brain edema.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The potential beneficial effects of HBOT were demonstrated in several clinical trials of&#xD;
      traumatic brain injury(TBI)/post-concussion patients. Some of these trials, especially those&#xD;
      in veterans, included patients who, in addition to post-concussion syndrome, had PTSD; as it&#xD;
      is estimated that half of the soldiers with post-concussion syndrome due to mild TBI also&#xD;
      meet the criteria of PTSD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the proposed study is to evaluate the effect of HBOT on PTSD symptoms in adults&#xD;
      with treatment resistant PTSD who were not exposed to TBI or blast injury. In addition to the&#xD;
      clinical outcome, brain functionality and microstructure will also be evaluated by PET and&#xD;
      DTI-MRI in order to shed additional light on the pathophysiology of PTSD and its response to&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study protocol:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thirty male patients with adult onset PTSD, defined by DSM-V criteria, as a result of combat&#xD;
      or a terror- related event, will be recruited to the study. Further criteria for study&#xD;
      inclusion will be: age 25-60 years, 4-years or more from the traumatic event and failure to&#xD;
      improve with at least one line of conventional treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study exclusion criteria will be: a history of traumatic brain injury or blast injury,&#xD;
      epilepsy, a brain tumor; skull base fractures or neurosurgery, severe substance use&#xD;
      disorders, a current manic episode, psychotic disorders or serious suicidal ideation at&#xD;
      baseline; or major cognitive deficits; a history of HBOT for any reason prior to study&#xD;
      enrollment; chest pathology incompatible with pressure changes (including active asthma);&#xD;
      inner ear disease; the inability to perform an awake brain MRI test; and the inability to&#xD;
      provide informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After recruitment, participants will be randomized to one of two study groups . A treatment&#xD;
      group will proceed to a course of HBOT, while participants in the control group will continue&#xD;
      with the current standard of care of psychiatric support and medications. After 3 months of&#xD;
      follow up, participants of both groups will be re-evaluated. The individuals in the control&#xD;
      group will then be offered to receive the treatment and to be re-reevaluated after the&#xD;
      treatment is over (3 months). Further evaluation will be done at 6 and 12 month to evaluate&#xD;
      long term effects of the treatment. During the study, all participant will continue with&#xD;
      their current medications unless otherwise advise by their treating physician.&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to the HBOT protocol, 60 daily HBOT sessions will be administrated 5 days per week.&#xD;
      Comprise of 90 minutes exposure to 100% oxygen at 2 ATA, with 5-minute air breaks every 20&#xD;
      minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study end points:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary end point PTSD symptoms, as assessed by the PTSD questionnaire&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary end points&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Sleep disorders questionnaire: Medical Outcome Sleep Scale (MOS)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Quality of life and mood questionnaires: Patient global impression of change, SF-36,&#xD;
           EQ-5D, SCL51&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Diary for daily documentation of symptoms&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Cognitive function- Cognitive function will be evaluated by the mainstreams Cognitive&#xD;
           Health Assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Brain imaging Brain imaging will include 2 types of imaging: perfusion magnetic&#xD;
           resonance imaging (MRI) + diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), including resting state&#xD;
           functional MRI and brain single photon emission computed tomography (PET-CT).&#xD;
&#xD;
           5.1 Perfusion MRI+DTI and Resting state fMRI (rsfMRI) a method of functional brain&#xD;
           imaging that can be used to evaluate regional interactions that occur when a participant&#xD;
           is not performing an explicit task. This resting brain activity is observed by means of&#xD;
           changes in blood flow in the brain, which creates what is referred to as a&#xD;
           blood-oxygen-level dependent (BOLD) signal that can be measured using functional MRI&#xD;
           (fMRI). +task 5.2 PET CT&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Physiological evaluation of brain functionality using transcranial magnetic stimulation&#xD;
           (TMS)-EEG examination:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This examination includes non-invasive safe brain monitoring and stimulation for the&#xD;
      assessment of changes in brain functionality and connectivity. The procedure includes&#xD;
      placement of EEG electrodes on an individual's head and measurement of the TMS-evoked&#xD;
      electrophysiological response in the various brain regions. The examination takes about 30&#xD;
      minutes.&#xD;
