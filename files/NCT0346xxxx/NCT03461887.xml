  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to assess the effectiveness of a home-based exercise training&#xD;
      program in COPD patients who have completed a pulmonary rehabilitation.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Exercise training is an important component of the management of chronic obstructive&#xD;
      pulmonary disease (COPD) and numerous trials have shown large improvements in health-related&#xD;
      quality of life (HRQoL) and exercise capacity in persons with COPD. However, the great&#xD;
      majority of patients who would benefit from pulmonary rehabilitation (PR) never follow such a&#xD;
      program. Moreover, many COPD patients are either not instructed to exercise at all or fail to&#xD;
      adhere to exercise training at home after completing pulmonary rehabilitation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study evaluates an exercise training program that requires minimal equipment (i.e., only&#xD;
      a chair and elastic bands) and can be easily implemented long-term in the patient's&#xD;
      home-setting.&#xD;

    <description>Home-based exercise training program that requires only minimal equipment, and is individually adaptable to the participant's exercise level (6 times per week; 15-20 min; 38 exercise cards and one interactive training agenda booklet). After randomization, a health care professional (HOMEX coach) will visit the intervention group participants at their home to set up the training location, to instruct the exercises and to establish individualized goals. Follow-up visits are planned after 3 and 8-9 weeks. Regular telephone calls will be conducted by the same HOMEX coach to motivate the patients, to discuss training progress and concrete benefits and barriers, and to adapt goals and the training program. Additional intervention elements are that a relative or friend is involved as a &quot;sparring&quot; partner to support the participant. The general practitioner is informed about the participation of his/her patient in the intervention.</description>
