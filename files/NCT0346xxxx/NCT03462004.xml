    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the safety, infectivity, and immunogenicity of two doses of the&#xD;
      HPIV3/ΔHNF/EbovZ GP vaccine candidate when administered intranasally in healthy adults.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be enrolled sequentially in two cohorts. Participants in Cohort 1 will be&#xD;
      randomly assigned to receive two doses of either 10^6.0 PFU/mL of HPIV3/ΔHNF/EbovZ-GP vaccine&#xD;
      or placebo. The first dose will be given on Day 0 and the second dose will be given 4-8 weeks&#xD;
      later. Participants in Cohort 2 will be randomly assigned to receive two doses of either&#xD;
      10^7.0 PFU/mL of HPIV3/ΔHNF/EbovZ-GP vaccine or placebo on Days 0 and 28.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be admitted to the inpatient unit 2 days prior to receiving their first&#xD;
      dose of the vaccine or placebo. While in the inpatient unit, study procedures will include&#xD;
      physical examinations, nasal washes, and blood collection. Participants will be discharged&#xD;
      from the inpatient unit on Day 8 or thereafter once two consecutive rRT-PCR assay results are&#xD;
      below the pre-determined threshold. An additional study visit will occur on Day 14.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Day 26 (+28), participants will be readmitted to the inpatient unit, and will receive&#xD;
      their second dose of the vaccine or placebo on Day 28 (+28). Participants will undergo the&#xD;
      same study procedures that occurred during the first inpatient stay, and will be discharged 7&#xD;
      days after the second dose, or once the subject is without respiratory symptoms and rRT-PCR&#xD;
      assay is below the pre-determined threshold (around Day 35). Additional study visits will&#xD;
      occur on Days 42 ± 3, 56 ± 5, 84 ± 5, 112 ± 7, 180 ± 14, 270 ± 14, and 360 ± 30.&#xD;
