  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This pilot phase I trial studies the side effects of total bone marrow and lymphoid&#xD;
      irradiation and how well it works with cyclophosphamide in treating patients with acute&#xD;
      myeloid leukemia. Total marrow and lymphoid irradiation targets cancer in bone marrow and&#xD;
      blood, instead of applying radiation to the whole body. Giving total bone marrow and lymphoid&#xD;
      irradiation before a donor transplant helps stop the growth of cells in the bone marrow,&#xD;
      including normal blood-forming cells (stem cells) and cancer cells. Drugs used in&#xD;
      chemotherapy, such as cyclophosphamide, work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer&#xD;
      cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from&#xD;
      spreading. Giving total bone marrow and lymphoid irradiation before donor transplant and&#xD;
      cyclophosphamide after transplant may work better at treating acute myeloid leukemia.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate the safety/feasibility of combining a total marrow and lymphoid irradiation&#xD;
      (TMLI) transplant conditioning regimen with a post-transplant high dose cyclophosphamide&#xD;
      (PTCy)-based graft versus host disease (GvHD) prophylaxis strategy, through the assessment&#xD;
      of: adverse events: type, frequency, severity, attribution, time course, duration and&#xD;
      complications: including acute GvHD, infection and delayed neutrophil/platelet engraftment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To estimate the cumulative incidence (CI) of acute GvHD at 100 days post allogeneic&#xD;
      hematopoietic cell transplantation (alloHCT).&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To estimate the CI of chronic GvHD at 6 months, 1- and 2-years post alloHCT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To estimate GVHD-free relapse-free survival (GRFS) at 1- and 2-years post alloHCT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To describe the kinetics of immune reconstitution and T cell repertoire in the first year&#xD;
      post alloHCT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. To estimate overall survival (OS), relapse-free survival (RFS) and CI of relapse, and&#xD;
      non-relapse mortality (NRM) at 100 days, 1- and 2-years post alloHCT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VI. To characterize quality of life using 36-Item Short Form Health Survey (SF-36),&#xD;
      Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Bone Marrow Transplant (FACT-BMT), and M. D. Anderson&#xD;
      Symptom Inventory (MDASI) or Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory (PedsQL) at 100 days, 6&#xD;
      months, 1- and 2-years post alloHCT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VII. To assess bone marrow cellularity from bone marrow samples. VIII. To assess the&#xD;
      clonogenic potential of cells from bone marrow samples. IX. To assess stromal damage from&#xD;
      bone marrow samples. X. To evaluate cytokines and oxidative stress markers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of TMLI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients undergo TMLI twice daily (BID) on days -4 to 0, then undergo bone marrow or&#xD;
      peripheral blood stem cell transplant on day 0. Patients receive cyclophosphamide&#xD;
      intravenously (IV) over 2 hours on days 3 and 4, tacrolimus given by continuous intravenous&#xD;
      infusion (CIV) on days 5-90, and filgrastim beginning on day 5 until absolute neutrophil&#xD;
      count (ANC) is at least 1,500/mm^3 for 3 consecutive days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed for up to 24 months.&#xD;

    <time_frame>Up to 24 months</time_frame>
    <description>Assessed using a. 36-Item Short Form Health Survey (SF-36). The SF-36 consists of eight scaled scores, which are the weighted sums of the questions in their section. Each scale is directly transformed into a 0-100 scale on the assumption that each question carries equal weight. The lower the score the more disability. The higher the score the less disability i.e., a score of zero is equivalent to maximum disability and a score of 100 is equivalent to no disability.&#xD;
The eight sections are:&#xD;
a1. vitality&#xD;
a2. physical functioning&#xD;
a3. bodily pain&#xD;
