  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Home care is the assistance provided at home to those who can not travel to their Health&#xD;
      Center. There are multiple studies on models of home care and many discrepancies about the&#xD;
      impact that preventive home visits can have. Hypothesis: home care is expected to be better&#xD;
      if performed by a team dedicated exclusively to the home patient, than to the traditional&#xD;
      model, where the patient is assisted by the team that cares for the rest of the community.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Goals:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main: determine the difference in median cumulative days of hospital admission in 12 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondaries:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  results in health&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  in health experience in efficiency Methodology: Quasi-experimental study of two years&#xD;
           duration. All the subjects included in the Home Care Program and that meet the inclusion&#xD;
           and exclusion criteria are studied. The care team will provide the informed consent and&#xD;
           information sheet to the patient and clinical scales at the beginning and end of the&#xD;
           study. Researchers will be responsible for the collection of data that they will&#xD;
           anonymize and guard. Statistical analysis: The analyzes will be calculated with the&#xD;
           statistical package SPSS version 21 Expected results: hospital admissions (25%) and&#xD;
           cumulative days by admission and patient by 65% are expected to improve in the model&#xD;
           under study. Applicability and relevance: the trend towards a greater aging of the&#xD;
           population makes it necessary to study models of care that allow us to detect which can&#xD;
           be beneficial to the population and feasible in our current context.&#xD;

      Our purpose will be to compare 2 models of home care corresponding to 2&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Care Centers (EAP):&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Model integrated (EAP Gran Sol), traditional, continuity, made by the UBA with care of&#xD;
           the home patient by the usual care team (family physician and nurse)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Model functional (EAP Apenins), based on the internal reorganization of the EAP:&#xD;
           equipment specific home care program composed of family physician and nurse, with&#xD;
           dedication exclusively to Preventive home visits, with training aimed at excellence in&#xD;
           the Management of fragile patients with pluripathology and palliative care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HYPOTHESIS. A care group dedicated exclusively to the ATDOM patient with what it entails in&#xD;
      dedication of time and specific knowledge could get better results in health, optimize health&#xD;
      resources and at the same time achieve greater satisfaction and quality of life to these&#xD;
      patients. That is why our hypothesis will be that it is expected that the patient's global&#xD;
      assistance attended from Primary Care in your home is better if it is performed by a Primary&#xD;
      Care team trained for it with exclusive dedication to this type of patient, that, with the&#xD;
      traditional model, where the patient that is attended at home is assisted by the clinical&#xD;
      team that serves the rest of the community.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OBJECTIVES Main objective The main objective will be the comparison of the two models of home&#xD;
      care in Primary care previously described by the difference in the average number of days&#xD;
      hospitalized for 12 months among the people served in an integrated model of home care and&#xD;
      among those served in a functional model. 3.2 Secondary objectives We will analyze them under&#xD;
      a triple vision AIM, triple goal, better health, better care, lower costs, -effectiveness,&#xD;
      efficiency and experience in people's health-&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Results in health: comparison in mortality at 12 months and integral geriatric&#xD;
           assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Results in experience in health care and quality of life:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Comparison of both models in terms of self-perception in patients' health included in the&#xD;
      preventive home care program, the patient's experience in attention to their health and&#xD;
      overload of the caregiver.&#xD;
&#xD;
      -Results in efficiency and resource utilization: comparison in professional assistance,&#xD;
      consumption of intermediate resources, consumption of social products, quality in the&#xD;
      prescription.&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODOLOGY OF THE STUDY.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Design of the study. It is a quasi-experimental study of 2 population samples. The group&#xD;
           of study is composed of the sample of subjects treated with the home care model&#xD;
           exclusive and expert. The control group is made up of the subjects that are treated with&#xD;
           the model of traditional home care. The study is expected to have a duration of 2 years&#xD;
           that will be the time of follow-up of each participant, being able present the&#xD;
           possibility of doing later substudies.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Population under study. Justification of the choice of the comparator. The integrated&#xD;
           model of home care that is implemented in EAP Gran Sol is compared with the proposed new&#xD;
           functional model that includes a team of family doctor and nurse dedicated exclusively&#xD;
           to patient care included in the home care program and who have received specific&#xD;
           training. This intervention has been carried out in EAP Apenins since 2013.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To the subjects of this obtained sample, a telephone call will be made inviting them to&#xD;
      participate in the study, agreeing a visit by the doctor or nurse responsible for the patient&#xD;
      and the subject of the project will be informed. In the agreed view, will give the informed&#xD;
      consent and the information sheet to the patient. Once signed in informed consent by the&#xD;
      subject or in case of patients with deterioration cognitive, by the caregiver, the&#xD;
      self-administered scales EuroQOL and IEXPACto the patient, in the case of patients with&#xD;
      cognitive impairment, at caregiver and the Zarit questionnaire to the main caregiver so that&#xD;
      complete They will be given an envelope to enter the completed scales that will be delivered&#xD;
      closed to the healthcare professional. Fragility will be measured with instrument of&#xD;
      Gérontopole at that time. These scales will be redelivered the patient and the caregiver at&#xD;
      the end of the study, after 2 years, with the same methodology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is considered inevitable that professionals know how to measure themselves since they have&#xD;
      their collaboration for the delivery of informed consent and information sheet to patient and&#xD;
      the EuroQol, IEXPAC and Zarit scales and calculation of fragility index.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There will be 2 training sessions for healthcare professionals on the project of the study&#xD;
      and the use of the scales they will deliver. Losses of selection of the sample are considered&#xD;
      to the subjects or main caregivers, in the case of subjects with cognitive impairment, who do&#xD;
      not sign informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Every 6 months the researchers will contact the subjects by telephone participants of the&#xD;
      study (each of their Primary Care Center) and on that call will proceed to question about&#xD;
      possible admission to private hospitals, stay in day centers or answer questions or provide&#xD;
      information about the study. Study groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      They are the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A control group of patients included in the Home Care program of the ABS Gran Sol where11&#xD;
      healthcare teams work with 241 patients in total in the Home care program (date December&#xD;
      2016) And a study group, of patients included in the Home Care program of ABS Apenins, the&#xD;
      which have a healthcare team that works exclusively for home care with 113 patients (date&#xD;
      December 2016) Study sample. Patients will be included who are in the Home care program and&#xD;
      who comply with the Inclusion and exclusion criteria.&#xD;
