  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The burden placed on advanced cancer family caregivers (FCGs) and the toll on their mental&#xD;
      and physical health have never been greater and is particularly pernicious for underserved&#xD;
      groups in the Southeastern U.S., including rural-dwellers and African-Americans, for whom&#xD;
      interventions have not been specifically developed and tested. The purpose of this K99/R00 is&#xD;
      provide the awardee with the knowledge and training necessary to become a leading independent&#xD;
      clinical investigator in developing and testing telehealth palliative care interventions for&#xD;
      family caregivers (FCGs) of underserved persons with advanced cancer. The research specific&#xD;
      aim during the K99 phase was to develop and tailor the content, format and delivery of a&#xD;
      telehealth intervention for FCGs of persons with advanced cancer in the rural South. To meet&#xD;
      this aim, qualitative semi-structured interviews were conducted with 26 lay healthcare&#xD;
      navigators, 20 FCGs, and 18 patients with advanced cancer to elicit feedback on a FCG&#xD;
      intervention outline based on published evidence-based interventions. After thematic&#xD;
      analysis, major findings included that the intervention should: have topical content that is&#xD;
      flexible and based on continuous assessment; include at least some face-to-face contact;&#xD;
      cautiously consider internet-based technologies because internet access in rural areas is&#xD;
      poor; and potentially have navigators lead the intervention with appropriate oversight and&#xD;
      additional training. K99 study findings have been used to adapt and develop a potentially&#xD;
      scalable FCG intervention in the Southern U.S. population (Project Cornerstone). The K99&#xD;
      study phase in combination with accomplishing the training objectives has successfully&#xD;
      catalyzed the awardee's transition from a Postdoctoral Fellow to a Tenure-Track Assistant&#xD;
      Professor at the University of Alabama at Birmingham School of Nursing. The overall goal&#xD;
      during the R00 phase will be to conduct a small-scale pilot RCT of Cornerstone with 70 FCGs&#xD;
      of rural-dwelling and/or African-American patients with advanced cancer to assess&#xD;
      acceptability, feasibility, and potential efficacy. The research specific aims during the R00&#xD;
      phase are to: evaluate the acceptability of Cornerstone and the feasibility of enrolling and&#xD;
      retaining 70 participants into a RCT of the FCG intervention for 24 weeks (Aim 1) and&#xD;
      evaluate the potential efficacy of Cornerstone in improving caregiver (Aim 2) and care&#xD;
      recipient (Aim 3) outcomes compared to usual care (quality of life and distress&#xD;
      [anxiety/depressive symptoms]). The results will directly support an R-01 application to&#xD;
      conduct an efficacy RCT of an early, telehealth PC intervention for Southern FCGs of&#xD;
      underserved persons with advanced cancer.&#xD;
