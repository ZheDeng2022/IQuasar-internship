  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The incidence of inflammatory bowel diseases, (IBD) including Crohn's disease (CD) and&#xD;
      ulcerative colitis (UC), is increasing in the developing world. Our recent Asia-Pacific&#xD;
      population-based study in 8 Asian countries and Australia has demonstrated that Hong Kong and&#xD;
      China have amongst the highest disease incidences in Asia while Australia has the equal&#xD;
      highest incidence of these diseases in the world.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The ENIGMA project comprises three main enteric microbiome domains of central importance to&#xD;
      Crohn's disease. Two specific organisms which may play a critical role in disease&#xD;
      pathogenesis, including the candidate protective bacterium, and the novel pathogenic&#xD;
      candidate, will be characterized and studied in detail. Microbial findings will be related to&#xD;
      a detailed assessment of environmental factors that permit microbial changes or expression.&#xD;

      The incidence of inflammatory bowel diseases, (IBD) including Crohn's disease (CD) and&#xD;
      ulcerative colitis (UC), is increasing in the developing world. Our recent Asia-Pacific&#xD;
      population-based study in 8 Asian countries and Australia have demonstrated that Hong Kong&#xD;
      and China have amongst the highest disease incidences in Asia while Australia has the equal&#xD;
      highest incidence of these diseases in the world. The incidence of IBD in Hong Kong and China&#xD;
      has risen three-fold in the past decade.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Asian populations have genetic predispositions to develop IBD which are different to the&#xD;
      West, but these genetic abnormalities are not obligatory for the development of IBD, with&#xD;
      environmental factors playing a much more important pathogenic role. These factors include&#xD;
      travel with exposure to a new population in childhood, diet, antibiotic use during childhood,&#xD;
      socioeconomic status, and a rural versus urban upbringing, each of which alone, or in&#xD;
      combination, are likely to affect the microbiome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Compelling evidence suggests that gut microbes play a critical role in disease pathogenesis,&#xD;
      while geographic, dietary and ethnic factors impact the microbial composition. In addition to&#xD;
      broad changes in the microbial profile in IBD, a number of specific changes have been&#xD;
      identified, such as a decrease of the butyrate-producing species Roseburia hominis and&#xD;
      Faecalibacterium Prausnitzii. Although the commensal gut microbiota is ecologically and&#xD;
      functionally perturbed in IBD, there is unexplained heterogeneity among IBD subtypes and&#xD;
      individual patients. In new-onset treatment na√Øve patients with CD, enrichment for the&#xD;
      Enterobacteriaceae and depletion of Clades IV and XIVa Clostridia during disease-associated&#xD;
      inflammation have been reported. Metagenomic studies and microarray analyses in Western&#xD;
      populations and limited Asian data have demonstrated a reduction of Firmicutes, such as F.&#xD;
      prausnitzii in Crohn's disease (CD), and an increased in Escherichia coli and Fusobacterium.&#xD;
      It is unknown if the changes in putative pathogens and/or protective organisms identified in&#xD;
      Western populations, such as E. coli and F. prausnitzii, respectively, are present in IBD&#xD;
      patients in Asia. Information is also lacking about the degree of genetic variation between&#xD;
      the bacteria assigned to these taxonomic groups from different ethnic and geographical&#xD;
      regions. Most of the published work on these bacteria, and their potential pathogenic or&#xD;
      protective role in CD, has been undertaken with isolates recovered from European and North&#xD;
      American subjects. For these reasons, The investigators believe there is a need to firmly&#xD;
      establish whether the microbial changes outlined above are also encountered in patients from&#xD;
      other parts of the world, including Asian countries with high disease incidence and&#xD;
      increasing disease incidence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Post-Operative Crohn's Endoscopic Recurrence (POCER) study was undertaken in 17 hospitals&#xD;
      around Australia and New Zealand and recruited 174 patients who were then monitored for 18&#xD;
      months post-operatively. The microbiota analyses undertaken on a subset of the POCER study&#xD;
      patient cohort showed that F. prausnitzii, previously identified as being capable of&#xD;
      producing anti-inflammatory properties possible key organism in preventing active CD were&#xD;
      decreased in abundance in active CD, in patients at the surgery who subsequently recurred,&#xD;
      and in patients at the time of recurrence. Most of the published studies examining the&#xD;
      anti-inflammatory properties of F. prausnitzii have been undertaken with a single strain of&#xD;
      European origin. Despite the promise associated with the anti-inflammatory properties&#xD;
      produced by F. prausnitzii it remains to be determined whether this bacterium is protective&#xD;
      against inflammation, or diminishes subsequent to the onset of inflammation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In summary, it is currently unclear if the changes in putative pathogens and protective&#xD;
      organisms present in Western IBD populations are consistently observed with CD patients in&#xD;
      Asia. Nor is it known whether the functional capabilities of these bacteria differ across&#xD;
      ethnic and/or geographic regions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to the characteristics of these two bacterial families, the microbial environment&#xD;
      interfacing with these organisms is likely to play a critical role in their expression and&#xD;
      function. This will be examined in detail using broad sequencing techniques.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Microbial analyses will be undertaken in the context of a detailed examination of&#xD;
      environmental risk factors for the development of CD, in the same patients.&#xD;
