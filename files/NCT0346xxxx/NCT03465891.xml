  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the safety and effects of atezolizumab with low dose&#xD;
      radiation on people with relapsed or refractory follicular lymphoma, In this study, the&#xD;
      patient will get either atezolizumab with low dose radiation or, atezolizumab alone. To be&#xD;
      better, the atezolizumab and low dose radiation should increase life by 1 year or more&#xD;
      compared to the usual approach.&#xD;
