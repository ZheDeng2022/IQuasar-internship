  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Due to the failure of the respiratory system, many patients admitted to the Intensive Care&#xD;
      Units (ICUs) require the institution of invasive mechanical ventilation (MV), aiming at&#xD;
      maintaining gas exchange, reversing respiratory muscle fatigue, among other benefits.&#xD;
      However, an artificial airway installation may be harmful because of its deleterious capacity&#xD;
      to the mucociliary clearance mechanism, predisposing to the accumulation of secretions and&#xD;
      consequent respiratory infections. Physiotherapy in patients critical for the purpose of&#xD;
      preventing and treating these respiratory complications. In this way, they are techniques&#xD;
      that aim at a reexpansion and removal of airborne secretions. An application of manual&#xD;
      hyperinflation with the Ambú (HM), applied through compression of the resuscitator (Ambu), an&#xD;
      application of hypertension for the use of energy, pulmonary volume. Similar to the goal of&#xD;
      manual hyperinflation, a hyperinflation maneuver without mechanical ventilator (HVM) is also&#xD;
      widely used and has been shown to be effective. A maneuvering visa re-expansion of collapsed&#xD;
      lung areas and increased peak expiratory flow, resulting in the mobilization of secretions.&#xD;
      It is known that these techniques can cause deleterious effects to the lungs due to the high&#xD;
      volumes administered and the variation in airway depression, predisposing to barotrauma and&#xD;
      volutrauma, increasing the lung permeability and consequent pulmonary edema. There may also&#xD;
      be a more subtle form of injury, such as a release of lung mediators, initiating a process of&#xD;
      local inflammation. This biological response is called biotrauma, and if these mediators&#xD;
      translocate into the systemic circulation, it can lead to dysfunction and death. The aim of&#xD;
      the present study was to evaluate the biomarkers of pulmonary lesion in the hyperinflation&#xD;
      maneuver with mechanical ventilator versus manual hyperinflation with environments in sudden&#xD;
      patients under mechanical ventilation.&#xD;

      This study aims to evaluate the biomarkers of lung injury in the hyperinflation maneuver with&#xD;
      mechanical ventilator versus manual hyperinflation with ambu in septic patients under&#xD;
      mechanical ventilation through changes in the cellular levels of interleukin 8 (IL-8) and&#xD;
      receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE). As specific objectives, compare the&#xD;
      variables of ventilatory mechanics (dynamic compliance, static complacency, frequency airway&#xD;
      resistance) and hemodynamic parameters (systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure,&#xD;
      mean arterial pressure and heart rate) before and after each maneuver and between groups. It&#xD;
      is characterized as a randomized clinical trial. The binary randomization of the groups will&#xD;
      be performed using the electronic application Bracket RTSM (version 2.0.0, Bracket Global),&#xD;
      and will be performed by a blind researcher to the groups evaluated. After the eligibility&#xD;
      criteria, the selected patients will be randomized and divided into two groups :&#xD;
      Hyperinflation group with mechanical ventilator (HVM) and manual hyperinflation group (HM).&#xD;
      Triage will be carried out daily in order to detect patients eligible to apply the study&#xD;
      through communication with the local multiprofessional team. Once patients are eligible&#xD;
      according to the inclusion and exclusion criteria, randomization will be performed to&#xD;
      determine the techniques to be employed. Prior to the application of each technique, all&#xD;
      patients will be placed in the dorsal decubitus (DD) with the head elevated at 30 degrees and&#xD;
      will be aspirated by the nursing team once with probe number nº 14 and with a vacuum of&#xD;
      -40cmH2O. Five minutes later, a 4.5 mL blood sample from the study participant for analysis&#xD;
      of lung injury biomarkers (IL-8 and RAGE) will be collected in an EDTA tube. Blood samples&#xD;
      will be sent to the Molecular and Protein Analysis Unit (UAMP) of the HCPA Experimental&#xD;
      Research Center (CPE) in a box cooled by a blind collaborator who is not part of the study&#xD;
      and will be stored at -80ºC. The biomarkers will be tested in duplicates through the plasma&#xD;
      of the sample collected using the Luminex Human Magnetic Assay kit (R &amp; DSystems,&#xD;
      Minneapolis, MN). The results will be transcribed to the datasheet. A period of five minutes&#xD;
      will be waited for the start of the initial technique chosen by randomization. When drawn to&#xD;
      the HVM group, there will be an increase in initial positive inspiratory pressure until&#xD;
      reaching a peak pressure of 40 cmH2O and PEEP equal to 7 cmH2O. During the application of&#xD;
      this technique VC will increase significantly in most patients, which may cause and / or&#xD;
      increase Auto-PEEP. In order to minimize and / or extinguish this adverse effect the RF&#xD;
      should be reduced to allow exhalation. When drawn to the HM group, the manual resuscitation&#xD;
      bag will be connected to the oxygen system at five liters per minute. The participant will be&#xD;
      disconnected from the ventilator and then initiate a slow inspiration with inspiratory pause&#xD;
      followed by abrupt expiration, totaling twelve (12) cycles / minute. Data will be collected&#xD;
      on ventilatory mechanics (dynamic compliance, expiratory tidal volume, respiratory rate, peak&#xD;
      pressure, plateau pressure, airway resistance) from the ventilator used in the SERVO-s®&#xD;
      institution and hemodynamic parameters (systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure,&#xD;
      mean arterial pressure and heart rate) in the hemodynamic monitoring device MP60® before and&#xD;
      after the application of each technique, and the data will be recorded on an evaluation form.&#xD;
      After each maneuver, a period of three hours will be waiting and then a blood sample will be&#xD;
      collected again from the patient for the analysis of lung injury biomarkers.&#xD;
