    <textblock>
      Backround: No data on the adjunctive effects of hyaluronic acid (HA) in a post-surgery,&#xD;
      chlorhexidine (CHX) - based plaque control regimen are available. Also, contrasting evidence&#xD;
      is available regarding the efficacy of CHX-based formulations containing anti-discoloration&#xD;
      system (ADS). The aim of the present study was to evaluate the post-surgery gingival healing&#xD;
      as well as plaque, gingival inflammation, and staining levels following the use of a 0.2%&#xD;
      chlorhexidine (CHX) solution with or without anti-discoloration system (ADS) and 0.2%&#xD;
      hyaluronic acid (HA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: Patients undergoing flap surgery at sites with an intact or reduced but healthy&#xD;
      periodontium participated in a parallel-arm RCT. After surgery, patients used the assigned&#xD;
      mouthrinse (CHX+HA+ADS or CHX) for 21 days. At day 7 and 21, the Gingival Healing Index (GHI)&#xD;
      was used to assess the quality of flap closure at the interdental papilla. Plaque index&#xD;
      (PlI), Gingival Index (GI), Angulated bleeding score (AngBS), tooth and tongue staining were&#xD;
      also assessed.&#xD;

    <measure>Gingival Healing Index</measure>
    <time_frame>GHI was evaluated at 7 days following surgery.</time_frame>
    <description>The healing process was evaluated at experimental teeth using a composite index, namely the Gingival Healing Index (GHI), which was created specifically to assess the post-surgery conditions of the interdental papilla. Briefly, the interdental papillae of experimental teeth were visually inspected, and a score was assigned for the severity of wound dehiscence (1-3) and the profile of the buccal and oral aspects of the papilla (1-3). For each patient, GHI score was obtained as the sum of the scores of each variable. Therefore, GHI ranged from 2 (worst quality of healing) to 6 (optimal quality of healing).</description>
