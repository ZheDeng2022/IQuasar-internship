  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Regular consumption of a beverage containing β-cryptoxanthin (β-Cx) and plant sterols (PS)&#xD;
      has been shown to exert a synergic effect in reducing some markers of cardiovascular risk and&#xD;
      bone-remodeling (formation and resorption). The present project aims to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluate (by in vivo and in vitro studies) the bioavailability of added β-Cx, PS and&#xD;
           galactooligosaccharides (GOS) and its stability in the beverage employed in the proposed&#xD;
           study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Study the biological effect (bioefficacy) associated with the regular consumption of&#xD;
           modified milk-based fruit beverages containing β-Cx, PS and GOS in post-menopausal women&#xD;
           (target group) by assessing changes in inflammation, cardiovascular and bone turnover&#xD;
           biochemical markers.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Characterize genetic variability (polymorphisms), genetic expression and DNA oxidative&#xD;
           damage in the target group as determinants of bioavailability and biological effects of&#xD;
           β-Cx, PS and GOS.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluate the potential prebiotic effect associated to regular consumption of a beverage&#xD;
           supplemented with β-Cx, PS and GOS: including &quot;in vitro&quot; studies and characterization of&#xD;
           subjects' microbiota and possible microbiota changes associated to the beverage&#xD;
           consumption.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A previous Clinical Trial (AGL2012-39503-C02) evidenced the beneficial synergic effects upon&#xD;
      bone remodeling and cardiovascular risk of a beverage, based on juice and milk, and enriched&#xD;
      with PS and β-Cx. &quot;In vitro&quot; and &quot;in vivo&quot; (clinical) studies have confirmed low absorption&#xD;
      of PS and β-Cx in this beverage, with possible slight modification of the sterols and&#xD;
      metabolites by the intestinal microbiota. PS and β-Cx can reach the colon and be transformed&#xD;
      by the intestinal microbiota with resulting beneficial effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The new Clinical Trial aims to determine whether the presence of galactooligosaccharides&#xD;
      (GOS) in a beverage containing PS and β-Cx might modulate the biological effects of these&#xD;
      latter components at either intestinal level (modification of microbiota and inflammatory&#xD;
      markers) or systemically (blood cholesterol-lowering effect and bone turnover).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the present clinical interventional study we will evaluate the systemic biological effects&#xD;
      of a beverage containing GOS, PS and β-Cx, as well as its intestinal effects and its&#xD;
      influence on the microbiota in postmenopausal women. Furthermore, we will study the stability&#xD;
      and bioavailability of PS and β-Cx in the beverage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The clinical study will help to confirm whether the new GOS-containing beverage has effects&#xD;
      upon cardiovascular risk markers, bone remodeling and inflammation at least equivalent to&#xD;
      those observed with the beverage studied in the previous Clinical Trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The results obtained will generate interesting information for improving beverage formulation&#xD;
      with bioactive components that might be relevant for food industry. Furthermore, clarifying&#xD;
      the beneficial effects of the studied beverages is relevant not only for healthy subjects but&#xD;
      also for those with certain disease conditions (i.e., intestinal inflammation diseases), and&#xD;
      may contribute to improve their wellbeing and health, with the consequent social and economic&#xD;
      benefits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN OF THE CLINICAL STUDY:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Single and combined randomized, double-blind, crossover multiple-dose supplementation trial&#xD;
      will be carried out with two beverages (250 ml/day): PS-enriched skimmed milk based fruit&#xD;
      beverage rich in β-Cx (sham beverage) and a similar skimmed milk based fruit beverage rich in&#xD;
      PS and β-Cx supplemented with GOS (active beverage),as diet supplementation in healthy&#xD;
      post-menopausal women.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Clinical study will take place at the Vitamins Unit of the Clinical Biochemistry Service&#xD;
      of the Hospital Universitario Puerta de Hierro-Majadahonda (Madrid, Spain).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size assessment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sample size was calculated taking into account the results of total PS and cholesterol&#xD;
      obtained in a previous clinical trial (no. NCT01074723). From previous assumption we choose&#xD;
      the more conservative option to assure detection of a 7% reduction of cholesterol levels in a&#xD;
      mild hypercholesterolemic subjects (e.g. 15 mg/dl) with a type I error of 0.05 and a&#xD;
      statistical power of 80%. Furthermore, taking into account that 45% of western population&#xD;
      might presented some polymorphisms implicated in the cholesterol absorption process, and&#xD;
      assuming a drop-out of 10%, the final sample size should included 40 subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Standard Operating procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two periods of intervention of 6 weeks separated by a wash-out period of 4 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the first trial period, 20 subjects daily will consume the active beverage and 20&#xD;
      subjects will consume the sham beverage for 6 weeks, and after a what-out period of 4 weeks,&#xD;
      the type of beverage to be consume during other 6 weeks period will be change (two-by-two&#xD;
      cross over assignment). All participants receive sham beverage and active beverage B at some&#xD;
      point during the trial but in a different order, depending on the group to which they are&#xD;
      assigned.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample collection (serum and faeces) will be performed before and after each 6 weeks&#xD;
      treatment periods.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All subjects should give written consent to participate in the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participants will be provided with a list of foods and beverage rich in β-Cx to be&#xD;
      avoided during the trial period and will be asked not to change its usual diet and physical&#xD;
      activity, to record any side effects during the study, and to complete a semi-quantitative&#xD;
      Food Frequency Questionnaire (FFQ) at the end of each intervention period. Question on the&#xD;
      organoleptic properties of the beverages will also be included.&#xD;
