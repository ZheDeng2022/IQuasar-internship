  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the effect of allograft bone particle size on the bone quantity and&#xD;
      quality following socket grafting and lateral ridge augmentation in preparation for&#xD;
      endosseous implant placement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pre (baseline)- and post-grafting (3 months for sockets and 6 months for edentulous ridges)&#xD;
      clinical as well as 2- and 3-dimensional radiographic measurements will be used to evaluate&#xD;
      the differences between sites grafted with small vs. large particle sized bone allografts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Histological analysis will be performed at time of surgical re-entry of grafted sites to&#xD;
      place the dental implants, and assessed for differences in new bone formation between the 2&#xD;
      types of grafts.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is a prospective, two-arm, randomized trial that will evaluate and compare the&#xD;
      bone healing following ridge preservation of extraction sockets (RP, Arms 1 and 2) or lateral&#xD;
      ridge augmentation of edentulous sites (RA, Arms 3 and 4) using either small particle (SP) or&#xD;
      large particle (LP) mineralized cortico-cancellous bone allografts in a total of 48 patients&#xD;
      (12 in each arm).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study approval was obtained from the university's institutional review board. Qualifying&#xD;
      participants and defects are randomized following a computerized permutation block to receive&#xD;
      either LP or SP allografts on day of surgery. In the RP arms, tooth extraction is performed&#xD;
      with a flapless minimally invasive technique, followed by socket grafting with a randomized&#xD;
      graft covered with a collagen dressing and sutures. In the RA arms, lateral ridge&#xD;
      augmentation is conducted utilizing a randomized bone graft covered by a collagen membrane&#xD;
      fixated with tacks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The mineralized cortico-cancellous bone allografts utilized in this study were all obtained&#xD;
      from the same donor, lot and tissue bank to account for variation in age, race, gender and&#xD;
      related healing potential of different graft sources.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the RP arm, bone core biopsies will be harvested at time of implant placement 3 months&#xD;
      following socket grafting, whereas similar biopsies will be obtained at 6 months following&#xD;
      lateral ridge augmentation in the RA group. These 2x2x6 mm bone cores will then undergo&#xD;
      histological and histomorphometrical analyses to determine qualitative and quantitative&#xD;
      healing differences between LP and SP in all study arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical measurements are gathered at 2 time points (grating and implant placement) at all&#xD;
      defects and will be compared for differences.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) initial scans are conducted immediately following socket&#xD;
      grafting (RP arms) and prior to ridge augmentation (RA arms) and second scans obtained prior&#xD;
      to implant placement (all RP and RA arms). Virtual implant planning software (coDiagnostiX)&#xD;
      will be utilized to assess and compare the 2- and 3-dimensional changes for all defects.&#xD;
