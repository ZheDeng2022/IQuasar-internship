  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Infectious endocarditis (IE) is a pathology where the mortality rate of between 20 and 25%,&#xD;
      but a higher morbidity since 50% of the patients are treated by a valvular surgical&#xD;
      procedure. The diagnosis of IE is often difficult and therefore too late. In 2015, the&#xD;
      European Society of Cardiology recommendations published by the integrate Positron Emission&#xD;
      Tomography with Computed Tomography (PET/CT) with 18F-Fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG) in the&#xD;
      diagnostic management of IE.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, during conventional examinations, with 12 hours fasting and low carb dieting,&#xD;
      myocardial uptake of 18F-FDG may be intense and interfere with results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to assess a strict low carbohydrate diet as Atkins (&lt;3gram/day&#xD;
      of carbohydrate) diet to facilitate the infective endocarditis diagnosis by 18F-FDG PET/CT&#xD;
      Primary objective is to assess a strict low carbohydrate diet during 12h and 12h fasting for&#xD;
      enhancing the contrast between infect area and surrounding structures and improve the&#xD;
      detectability of infective endocarditis by PET/CT&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Comparison of the detection sensitivity of IE outbreaks between 18F-FDG PET/CT performed&#xD;
           with the low carbohydrate diet and conventional diet performed&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To assess the strict low carbohydrate diet effects on the uptake 18F-FDG distribution ,&#xD;
           particularly in the myocardium, circulating blood, skeletal muscles, brain and liver.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Characterization of metabolic changes generated by the low carbohydrate diet using&#xD;
           plasma bioassays (blood glucose, insulinemia, free fatty acid concentration,&#xD;
           ß-hydroxybutyrate).&#xD;
