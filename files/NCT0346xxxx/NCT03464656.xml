      The proposed research aims to study the effects of antioxidant therapy, commonly used in male&#xD;
      infertility treatment, on semen analysis. Patients presenting with male infertility, who are&#xD;
      found to have abnormal semen analysis shall be recruited to this study. They will be asked to&#xD;
      provide a sample of semen for routine semen analysis and advanced semen tests including sperm&#xD;
      DNA fragmentation and sORP before starting with antioxidant therapy and after 3-month&#xD;
      treatment with antioxidants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completing the data analysis, we intend to publish the study in high impact perr&#xD;
      reviewed journals and present it in international conferences.&#xD;

      The proposed research aims to study the effects of antioxidant therapy, commonly used in male&#xD;
      infertility treatment, on semen analysis. Several studies have been conducted to evaluate the&#xD;
      effect of many antioxidant regimens on male infertility. A randomized double-blind,&#xD;
      placebo-controlled trial investigated a combined antioxidant regimen, including vitamin C,&#xD;
      using Menevit (lycopene 6mg, vitamin E 400IU, vitamin C 100mg, zinc 25mg, selenium 26 mcg,&#xD;
      folate 0.5mg, garlic 1g) in couples undergoing intracytoplasmic sperm injection. The authors&#xD;
      reported a significant improvement in viable pregnancy rate in the treatment group, where&#xD;
      38.5% of transferred embryos resulted in a viable fetus compared to 16% in the placebo group&#xD;
      (Tremellen K, 2007). Suleiman et al. studied 300 mg of daily vitamin E in a&#xD;
      placebo-controlled study revealing significant improvement in sperm motility and reduction of&#xD;
      oxidative stress measures in the treatment group. Moreover, they reported a 21% spontaneous&#xD;
      pregnancy rate in the treatment group compared to 0% in the placebo group (Suleiman SA,&#xD;
      1996).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients presenting with male infertility, who are found to have abnormal semen analysis&#xD;
      shall be recruited to this study. They will be asked to provide a sample of semen for routine&#xD;
      semen analysis and advanced semen tests including sperm DNA fragmentation and sORP before&#xD;
      starting with antioxidant therapy and after 3-month treatment with antioxidants. No other&#xD;
      procedures will be done for research purposes. All other investigations or treatments will be&#xD;
      given according to the standard of care. Routinely patients presenting to the male&#xD;
      infertility unit at HMC seeking evaluation and treatment for delayed conception will be&#xD;
      assessed with a history and physical examination, investigated with semen and endocrine&#xD;
      studies and be placed on an antioxidant regimen comprised of vitamins C and E, L-Carnitine&#xD;
      and pentoxyfylline. Further management will be individualized and planned according to each&#xD;
      patient's condition.&#xD;

    <description>Full semen analysis according to WHO semen laboratory manual 5th edition will be done pre and 3 months post-treatment.&#xD;
After complete liquefaction, each sample was evaluated for both macroscopic parameters such as color, pH, ejaculate volume, age of the sample and viscosity. An aliquot of the sample was examined for sperm concentration, total sperm count, total and progressive motility and sperm morphology using the WHO fifth edition guidelines (WHO, 2010). Semen analysis was done manually using a hemocytometer. Sperm motility was assessed and categorized as progressive or non-progressive. Morphology was assessed by a single experienced technician using the Diff-Quik staining protocol. Kruger's strict criteria were used for morphology assessment with 4% normal morphology as a cut-off (WHO, 2010).</description>

    <description>Sperm DNA fragmentation was evaluated using the Halosperm kit from Halotech DNA, S.L. (Madrid, Spain) as per manufacturer instructions. The method is based on the sperm chromatin dispersion test (Fern√°ndez et al., 2003). A minimum of 500 spermatozoa were scored and reported as percentage of sperm with spermatozoa with fragmented DNA. Normal value is measure at a cut-off value of more than 30%</description>

    <intervention_name>Static Oxidation reduction potential in semen</intervention_name>
    <description>Oxidative stress was assessed by measuring the static oxidation-reduction potential (sORP) of neat liquefied semen samples using the MiOXSYSTM System (Aytu Bioscience, Inc., Englewood, USA). This is a galvanostatic measure of the electron transfer from reductants (antioxidants) to oxidants under a steady low voltage reducing current. Thus, providing an aggregate measure of all current oxidant activity and antioxidant activity in a sample. Higher sORP values (millivolts, mV) indicate a higher oxidant activity relative to the antioxidant activity and therefore greater state of oxidative stress.</description>
