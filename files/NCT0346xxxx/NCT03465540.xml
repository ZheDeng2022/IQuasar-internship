  <brief_summary>

      Evaluate the safety and tolerability of AMG 397. Estimate the maximum tolerated doses (MTDs)&#xD;
      and/or biologically active doses.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a first-in-human (FIH), multicenter, non-randomized, open-label, phase 1 study&#xD;
      evaluating AMG 397 administered orally once weekly, as part of a 28-day treatment cycle in&#xD;
      adult subjects with selected relapsed or refractory hematological malignancies&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </detailed_description>
  <overall_status>Terminated</overall_status>
  <why_stopped>
    Strategic decision given our current development of AMG 176 (a similar MCL-1 inhibitor) that is&#xD;
    in clinic, and not because of safety concerns&#xD;

There is no end date for eligibility to submit a data sharing request for this study.</ipd_time_frame>
    <ipd_access_criteria>Qualified researchers may submit a request containing the research objectives, the Amgen product(s) and Amgen study/studies in scope, endpoints/outcomes of interest, statistical analysis plan, data requirements, publication plan, and qualifications of the researcher(s). In general, Amgen does not grant external requests for individual patient data for the purpose of re-evaluating safety and efficacy issues already addressed in the product labelling. Requests are reviewed by a committee of internal advisors, and if not approved, may be further arbitrated by a Data Sharing Independent Review Panel. Upon approval, information necessary to address the research question will be provided under the terms of a data sharing agreement. This may include anonymized individual patient data and/or available supporting documents, containing fragments of analysis code where provided in analysis specifications.
