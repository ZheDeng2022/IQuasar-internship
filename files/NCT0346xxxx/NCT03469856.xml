      A multicenter, single arm, open-label trial of prasugrel monotherapy after PCI with the&#xD;
      new-generation thin-strut biodegradable polymer everolimus-eluting SYNERGY® stent in patients&#xD;
      with chronic stable angina&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Single antiplatelet therapy with prasugrel is safe in selected patients undergoing successful&#xD;
      PCI with the new generation biodegradable polymer everolimus-eluting SYNERGY® stent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To assess in a proof-of-concept study the safety of single antiplatelet therapy with&#xD;
      prasugrel after PCI with a new generation biodegradable polymer drug eluting stent in terms&#xD;
      of ischemic and bleeding outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The ASET Pilot study is a multicenter, single arm, open-label trial of single antiplatelet&#xD;
      therapy with prasugrel for patients undergoing successful and optimal PCI for chronic stable&#xD;
      angina with normal cardiac biomarkers values. The patients will be loaded with standard dual&#xD;
      antiplatelet therapy according to local practice (usually aspirin 300 mg and clopidogrel 600&#xD;
      mg, unless patient is on long-term therapy) at least 2 hours prior to the diagnostic&#xD;
      catheterization or PCI procedure. After PCI, if the results are considered to be satisfactory&#xD;
      by the operator based on clinical (e.g. clinical status, ECG, etc.), angiographic and/or&#xD;
      findings from intracoronary imaging, only then patients will be enrolled in the study and&#xD;
      loaded with prasugrel 60 mg and continued with prasugrel only (10 mg once a day) for three&#xD;
      months. Aspirin and clopidogrel will be discontinued. At the 3-months follow-up visit,&#xD;
      prasugrel (only) will be replaced by aspirin (only) or dual-antiplatelet therapy according to&#xD;
      local standard of care. Clinical follow-up with office visit will be performed at 3 months&#xD;
      and telephone contacts at 1, and 4 months (final follow-up). All events will be adjudicated&#xD;
      by an independent clinical events committee (CEC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      An independent Data Safety and Monitoring Board (DSMB) will monitor the individual and&#xD;
      collective safety of the patients in the study during enrolment phase and up to 3 months&#xD;
      follow-up (primary endpoint).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The ASET study is a proof-of-concept pilot, feasibility and safety study designed as a single&#xD;
      arm, open label trial with a stopping rule based on the occurrence of definite stent&#xD;
      thrombosis. Based on previous pilot studies, 200 patients will be enrolled. The trial will be&#xD;
      terminated if more than three (&gt;3) patients experience definite stent thrombosis following&#xD;
      index procedure till 4 months follow-up.&#xD;
