      A Dose-Rising Clinical Trial to Evaluate the Pharmacokinetics, Safety and Tolerability of&#xD;
      Treprostinil Inhalation Powder in Healthy Normal Volunteers&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Up to 48 subjects will be enrolled in 8 cohorts of 6 subjects each. The treatments are&#xD;
      intended to establish the maximum tolerated dose in healthy normal volunteers, starting at 30&#xD;
      mcg. Each subject will receive one dose of Treprostinil Inhalation Powder by oral inhalation&#xD;
      during the treatment period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 12 pharmacokinetic blood samples will be collected from each subject. Plasma&#xD;
      pharmacokinetic samples will be analyzed for treprostinil.&#xD;
