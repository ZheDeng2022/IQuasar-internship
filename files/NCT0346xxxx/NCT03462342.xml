      Investigational agent, AZD6738 will be given in combination with Olaparib to women with&#xD;
      recurrent ovarian cancer (platinum-sensitive or platinum-resistant).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will determine if using Olaparib in combination with AZD6738 is safe and tolerable&#xD;
      and also determine the objective response rate and progression free survival of combination&#xD;
      of AZD6738 and Olaparib in women with recurrent ovarian cancer in distinct platinum-sensitive&#xD;
      and platinum-resistant cohorts.&#xD;

        Inclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        For inclusion in the study, patients must fulfill the following criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Patients ≥ 18 years of age&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 or 1 and a life&#xD;
             expectancy of at least 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. For Cohorts A-C, and Cohort D, Part II, patients must have high grade serous ovarian,&#xD;
             primary peritoneal, and/or fallopian tube cancer histologically or cytologically&#xD;
             confirmed that is recurrent and for which standard curative measures do not exist or&#xD;
             are no longer effective. For Cohort D, Part I, patients may have any non-mucinous&#xD;
             epithelial ovarian cancer (including histologies such as clear cell, or endometrioid).&#xD;
             Pathology must be reviewed internally at the University of Pennsylvania, Johns Hopkins&#xD;
             University, or Harvard University prior to initiation of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. All patients under consideration for Cohorts A, B, C, and D, must be willing to&#xD;
             undergo mandatory tumor biopsies (non-target lesion). Patients should have at least&#xD;
             one lesion (non-target) for biopsy. However, for 50% of patients in Cohorts A, B, C,&#xD;
             and D, if patients are found to not have a safe lesion to biopsy by the radiology&#xD;
             team, they may still be enrolled in the study and forego the biopsy. Patients who&#xD;
             undergo attempted biopsies that are unsuccessful may still enroll and receive study&#xD;
             drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. All patients must have a measurable disease by RECIST v1.1.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Germline BRCA mutation status:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Cohorts A and B: Patients with unknown BRCA status or negative BRCA germline&#xD;
                  mutation status will be permitted to enroll in the study. Patients with known&#xD;
                  BRCA germline mutations will be permitted to enroll up to a maximum of 10&#xD;
                  subjects per cohort.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Cohort C and Cohort D Part II: All subjects must have either a germline or&#xD;
                  somatic BRCA mutation, or other HRD mutation, or tumor is HRD positive. Other HRD&#xD;
                  mutations will be reviewed for consideration for enrollment by study review&#xD;
                  committee or University of Pennsylvania principal investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Cohort D Part I: Patients will be enrolled irrespective of BRCA status.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Adequate renal function, defined as measured creatinine clearance ≥ 51 ml/min.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Adequate hepatic function, defined as AST and ALT levels ≤ 2.5 X ULN (for subjects&#xD;
             with liver metastases, AST or ALT ≤ 5 × ULN) and total bilirubin &lt; 1.5 X ULN, absent&#xD;
             Gilbert's disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Adequate bone marrow function, defined as absolute neutrophil count (ANC ≥ 1.5 X&#xD;
             109/L), platelet count ≥ 100 x 109/L, and hemoglobin ≥ 10 g/dL (in the absence of&#xD;
             transfusion within 28 days prior to dosing).&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Patients must be at least 2 weeks from previous therapy for their ovarian cancer&#xD;
             (chemotherapy, hormonal therapy, and radiation therapy, or investigational agents; 6&#xD;
             weeks for mitomycin C) to initiate screening and 3 weeks from previous therapy to&#xD;
             initiate treatment. Hormones for breast cancer management may be continued at the&#xD;
             discretion of the provider.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Platinum-sensitive is defined as recurrence &gt;6 months by RECIST 1.1 imaging from last&#xD;
             platinum. Platinum-resistant is defined as recurrence ≤ 6 months by RECIST 1.1 imaging&#xD;
             from last platinum regimen).&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  For Cohort A, there is no limit to number of prior regimens.&#xD;

               -  For Cohort B, patients may not have had more than 3 prior cytotoxic therapies&#xD;
                  since the development of platinum-resistance.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Patients for Cohort D, Part I (dose escalation), patients may be either&#xD;
                  platinum-sensitive with no limit on prior regimens. Platinum-resistant patients&#xD;
                  are eligible but they may not have received more than 3 prior cytotoxic therapies&#xD;
                  since development of platinum resistance.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Cohort C and Cohort D, Part II, patients must be platinum-sensitive BUT with no&#xD;
                  limit to number of prior cytotoxic therapies. These patients must demonstrate&#xD;
                  adequate bone marrow function as determined by the treating physician.&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Prior treatment with a PARPi is permitted but not mandatory for Cohorts A and B and&#xD;
             Cohort D Part I. Prior treatment with PARPi is mandatory for Cohort C and D Part II.&#xD;
             If a patient has received a prior PARPi, then the patient must have demonstrated a&#xD;
             clinical benefit of PARPi treatment by an initial response (by CA-125 or imaging) to&#xD;
             PARPi treatment or clinical benefit from PARPi treatment as maintenance therapy&#xD;
             followed by disease progression for enrollment onto Cohort C and D Part II. Clinical&#xD;
             benefit for maintenance is defined as:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. prior maintenance with PARPi after 1st line chemotherapy of at least 12 months or&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. prior maintenance with PARPi after &gt;1 line of chemotherapy for minimum of 6&#xD;
                  months. Subjects on Cohort A may have received treatment with PARPi, clinically&#xD;
                  benefitted, but not have progressed on a PARPi. This arm to is evaluate&#xD;
                  participants who have received prior PARPi (PARPi after PARPi). If the prior PARP&#xD;
                  inhibitor used was olaparib, then patients must have received treatment without&#xD;
                  significant toxicity or the need for a permanent dose reduction. For Cohort C and&#xD;
                  D Part II, patients may not have received cytotoxic chemotherapy in the interval&#xD;
                  between PARPi monotherapy and enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. Patients who have had major surgery (as defined by the Site PI) must be fully&#xD;
             recovered and ≥4 weeks post-operative prior to enrolling on study.&#xD;
&#xD;
         14. Patients must be able to swallow oral medications (capsules and tablets) without&#xD;
             chewing, breaking, crushing, opening, or otherwise altering the product formulation.&#xD;
             They should not have gastrointestinal illnesses that would preclude the absorption of&#xD;
             AZD6738 or olaparib, which are oral agents.&#xD;
&#xD;
         15. Postmenopausal defined as:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Amenorrhea for 1 year or more following cessation of exogenous hormonal&#xD;

&#xD;
               -  LH and FSH levels in post-menopausal range for women under 50;&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Radiation induced oophorectomy with last menses &gt;1 year ago;&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Chemotherapy-induced menopause with &gt;1 yr interval since last menses;&#xD;

&#xD;
          1. Patients with known brain metastases diagnosed within one year will be excluded from&#xD;
             this clinical trial because of their poor prognosis and because they often develop&#xD;
