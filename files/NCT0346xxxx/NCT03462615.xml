  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Malaria during pregnancy remains an important public health issue in endemic countries. Most&#xD;
      cases of malaria in pregnant women are asymptomatic, and can contribute to adverse outcomes,&#xD;
      such as maternal and neonatal anaemia as well as low birth weight. Infections that do not&#xD;
      cause symptoms (sub-clinical infections) - particularly in low transmission settings -remain&#xD;
      difficult to diagnose during pregnancy but can contribute to adverse outcomes e.g. growth&#xD;
      restriction, premature birth, miscarriage and stillbirth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation (BMGF) has supported the development of an HRP2-based&#xD;
      high sensitivity rapid diagnostic tests (HS-RDT) that has analytical sensitivity ten times&#xD;
      better than current RDTs and a sensitivity near 80% when compared to the 'gold standard' of&#xD;
      quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). In this regard, the new HS-RDT may be a&#xD;
      promising diagnostic and screening test for subclinical malaria during pregnancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The overall aim is to compare the performance of novel high sensitivity rapid detection tests&#xD;
      with conventional rapid diagnostic tests for Plasmodium falciparum malaria infection in&#xD;
      pregnant women in Papua New Guinea&#xD;
