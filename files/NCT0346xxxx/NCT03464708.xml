  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to investigate the effect of beta-hydroxy-beta-methylbutyrate (HMB) on&#xD;
      skeletal muscle wasting, physical function, strength and quality of life in survivors of&#xD;
      critical illness. In addition, protein turnover, muscle biology and muscle histology will be&#xD;
      investigated.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a double blind, placebo controlled, randomised controlled trial with the primary&#xD;
      objective of investigating the effect of HMB on skeletal muscle wasting in early critical&#xD;
      illness. Secondary objectives include determining the effect of HMB on skeletal muscle&#xD;
      quality, strength, function and quality of life in survivors of critical illness. In&#xD;
      addition, the effect of HMB on muscle protein turnover, muscle protein signalling, muscle&#xD;
      fibre size and protein:DNA ratio will be investigated in a sub-group of participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible participants will be randomised to receive either 3 g/day HMB or 3 g/day placebo&#xD;
      within 24 hours of admission to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU). This will be continued until&#xD;
      hospital discharge or 28-days, whichever comes first.&#xD;
