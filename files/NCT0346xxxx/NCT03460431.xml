      Patients The study included 30 Egyptian patients with keloid scar recruited from the Out&#xD;
      Patient Clinic, Dermatology Department, Cairo University.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Thirty patients with keloid scar(s) were included in the study&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Every patient was subjected to the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Complete history taking: History of disease onset, course and duration, family history&#xD;
           as well as history of any systemic or dermatological disease interfering with the&#xD;
           eligibility of participation in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Thirty patients were included in the study which is a clinical comparative study&#xD;
           comparing the effectiveness of fractional CO2, long pulsed Nd YAG and their combination&#xD;
           in collagen remodeling in keloid clinically in all the included patients and&#xD;
           biochemically and immunohistochemically fifteen patient&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Full clinical examination:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  General examination to determine any systemic or dermatological disease that might&#xD;
                preclude the patient from participation in the study such as collagen disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Local examination to determine Fitzpatrick skin color of the patient and the site&#xD;
                and extent of the scar to be treated.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
           - Cases with multiple keloid scars three lesions 2 to 3 cm apart from each other were&#xD;
           selected and labeled. The first one (lesion A) was treated using fractional CO2 laser&#xD;
           10,600 nm, the second (lesion B) long pulsed Nd YAG laser 1064 nm, while the last&#xD;
           (lesion C) combined fractional CO2 followed by Nd YAG lasers after half an hour were&#xD;
           used&#xD;
&#xD;
           - patients who had a large sized lesion, the lesion was divided into three equal parts 2&#xD;
           to 3 cm apart from each other, they were labeled as areas A, B and C then subjected to&#xD;
           the same treatment modalities as mentioned in case of multiple lesions.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Patients received 4 treatment sessions 4 to 8 weeks apart. Laser modalities and&#xD;
                parameters&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Topical anesthesia (lidocaine 2.5% and prilocaine 2.5%) was applied to the working&#xD;
                area 30 to 60 minutes before the sessions, washed off and properly dried before the&#xD;
                procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Ablative fractional 10,600 nm carbon dioxide laser (DEKA smartxide DOT, Italy) and&#xD;
                long pulsed Nd-YAG (DEKA synchro FT) were used in the treatment sessions with the&#xD;
                following parameters Fractional CO2 Stacking: 5, Power: 20 Watt, Dwell time: 1000&#xD;
                micro second, Spacing : 800 micro meter fluence: 40 j/cm2 Pulse duration: 0.3 milli&#xD;
                second Spot size: 5 mm Passes: 3.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Assessment Assessment was done before treatment every session and one months after the&#xD;
           final laser treatment. Clinical assessment was done for all patients while&#xD;
           histopathological and biochemical assessment were done only in 15 patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
           A. Clinical evaluation Clinical assessment was fulfilled via calculating the scores of&#xD;
           both the Vancouver Scar Scale; and the Patient and Observer Scar Assessment Scale.&#xD;
           Patients were assessed every session, any side effects were reported, e.g pain,&#xD;
           swelling, infection, hyper pigmentation or hypo pigmentation.&#xD;
&#xD;
           B. Histopathological and biochemical evaluation&#xD;
&#xD;
           Fifteen patients were randomly selected and subjected to the pre and post treatment&#xD;
           biopsies :&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Pretreatment biopsy:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Three mm punch skin biopsy was taken from the keloid (any lesion A, B, or C) before&#xD;
           starting treatment sessions ●Post treatment biopsies: Each lesion (A, B, C) was biopsied&#xD;
           separately (3 mm punch biopsy), one month after last treatment session.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Biopsies of controls ●parts of excess skin from 12 patients undergoing abdominoplasty&#xD;
           were used as controls for levels of TGFβ1 and TGFβ3.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Procedure&#xD;
&#xD;
           - Biopsies were fixed in 10 % neutral buffered formalin, and then embedded in paraffin&#xD;
           blocks. Sections were prepared for routine staining by H&amp;E. Other sections were prepared&#xD;
           for histochemical staining of collagen fibres using Masson's trichrome stain and elastic&#xD;
           fibres using orcein stain&#xD;
&#xD;
           - All sections were examined using a Zeiss, Primo star light microscope (Zeiss,&#xD;
           Germany). The microscope has an integrated camera by which photomicrographs depicting&#xD;
           the various histopathological and histochemical findings were obtained. All&#xD;
           photomicrographs presented in the thesis are according to their original magnification.&#xD;
&#xD;
           • Evaluation of elastic fibres in orcein stained sections:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Orcein stained sections were graded according to the grading criteria proved by Ozog et&#xD;
           al. in 2013 for the appearance of the dermal elastic tissue as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      0 normal&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. short fragmented elastic fibres&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. intermediate between 1 and 3&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. fibrillar elastic fibres, parallel to epidermis&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. intermediate between 3 and 5&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. absent or nearly absent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Image analyzer evaluation (morphometric study):&#xD;
&#xD;
      The area percent of collagen and elastic fibres were quantitatively evaluated in Masson's&#xD;
      trichrome and orcein stained sections respectively at magnification X100 in 5 non overlapping&#xD;
      fields for all patients. Image analysis was done using Leica Qwin 500C image analyzer&#xD;
      computer system (England) present in the Histology Department, Faculty of Medicine, Cairo&#xD;
      University .&#xD;
