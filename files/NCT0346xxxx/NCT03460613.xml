  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a disorder of gastrointestinal function characterized by&#xD;
      abdominal symptoms and pain associated with alterations in bowel habit. The condition impacts&#xD;
      on the quality of life of at least 10% of the population, impacts on activities of daily&#xD;
      living and is associated with considerable direct and indirect costs to the individual, the&#xD;
      health system and society. The etiology of IBS appears multifactorial and several mechanisms,&#xD;
      among them mucosal inflammation, abnormal intestinal motility, visceral hypersensitivity and&#xD;
      psychological factors, appear to be involved.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An underlying pathophysiology, namely Joint Hypermobility (JH) and Joint Hypermobility&#xD;
      Syndrome (JHS), that we are going to study, have recently gained increasing attention in&#xD;
      patients with functional bowel disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One factor which was shown in previous IBS-studies to reduce abdominal symptoms is a FODMAP&#xD;
      diet.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To identify FGID patients which profit most from different diagnostics and therapies (such as&#xD;
      FODMAP diet) we are going to carry out a study analyzing different subtypes of FGID (in&#xD;
      particular IBS, FD, functional abdominal pain/bloating) for demographics, clinical&#xD;
      diagnostics (e.g. nutrient challenge testing, microbiome testing, anorectal manometry and MR&#xD;
      defecography), comorbidities (in particular JH, JHS and psychological comorbidities) and&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Functional gastrointestinal disorders (FGID) are common in the general population. Symptoms&#xD;
      such as pain, nausea, bloating, diarrhea or constipation may occur. Irritable bowel syndrome&#xD;
      (IBS) is the most common FGID with a prevalence in the range of 5-25%. Medical attention is&#xD;
      sought by 20-75% of patients who meet diagnostic criteria for IBS at some time in their&#xD;
      lives. Quality of life is often impaired in IBS patients. In previous studies a diet low in&#xD;
      FODMAP was shown to reduce gastrointestinal symptoms in IBS patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      But still it is unknown which FGID patients (e.g. patients with irritable bowel syndrome,&#xD;
      functional dyspepsia (FD), functional abdominal pain/bloating) profit most from such a diet&#xD;
      which involves costs, time and significant lifestyle alteration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To test for food intolerances, standard hydrogen breath tests using fructose or lactose as&#xD;
      challenge substance are still commonly used and do present a nutritional challenge, however&#xD;
      the usefulness of information gained is questionable. Fructose intolerance is as prevalent in&#xD;
      IBS as in healthy volunteers, in fact when tested with the usual doses of 25-50g, prevalence&#xD;
      of fructose intolerance ranges between 53% and 73%. Testing (genetic) for hypolactasia, is&#xD;
      often, even in the professional setting, misunderstood as lactose intolerance testing. Most&#xD;
      patients, who do have hypolactasia, i.e. almost no activity of intestinal brush-border enzyme&#xD;
      lactase, tolerate up to 12g of lactose per day, remain asymptomatic and therefore should not&#xD;
      be considered lactose intolerant. In addition, one must realize, that the vast majority in&#xD;
      the world is hypolactasic and hypolactasia, or rather lactase persistence, constitutes a norm&#xD;
      variant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently it was shown that a standardized liquid mixed nutrient meal including 25g lactulose,&#xD;
      but not with 15g lactulose, allows differentiation of IBS patients from healthy controls.&#xD;
      This test, incorporating FODMAP lactulose, that, unlike lactose and fructose, is indigestible&#xD;
      in all humans in the small intestine, plus a caloric load, reflecting a regular meal and&#xD;
      everyday life, has therefore the potential to be a useful marker of nutrient intolerance in&#xD;
      patients with suspected functional bowel disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additionally, associations between FGID and JH/JHS have been recognized in the past decade.&#xD;
      JH/JHS constitutes a hereditary disorder of connective tissue in which patients often report&#xD;
      non-musculoskeletal symptoms, among them gastrointestinal complaints. Previous studies in&#xD;
      Europe and the U.S. have reported a JHS prevalence of 20% in the general population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A stringent approach to studying possibly JH and JHS-related changes with diagnostic and&#xD;
      interventional arms, such as a nutrient challenge testing or dietary adaptation (i.e.FODMAP&#xD;
      diet) has not yet been taken.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Differences in the intestinal microbiome have been shown in IBS patients compared to healthy&#xD;
      volunteers but not in JHS compared to non-JHS patients. Given the differences noted in&#xD;
      patients' symptomatology, the preliminary data on gut function and the underlying structural&#xD;
      abnormalities, the role of microbiome in relation to FGID and JHS is highly interesting and,&#xD;
      as yet, unstudied. In recent years with the advent of more powerful sequencing tools, a&#xD;
      number of studies have been published, that try to characterize the microbiome in IBS&#xD;
      patients. Research on IBS-related changes of the microbiome is early and incomplete. The&#xD;
      number of literature reviews regarding gut microbiome currently far exceeds the number of&#xD;
      original articles reporting on the microbiome in functional bowel disease. IBS-specific&#xD;
      interventional studies are even rarer and when performed, often lack control groups and the&#xD;
      reality of multiple or repeated intervention, that characterize treatment of FGID. Therefore,&#xD;
      and to identify patients according to their microbiome which profit most from therapeutic&#xD;
      intervention (such as FODMAP diet) we are also going to analyze microbiome changes before and&#xD;
      after FODMAP diet.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Another pathological, impairing aspect of IBS patients is the intestinal hypersensitivity.&#xD;
      Anorectal hypersensitivity measurement has been considered a hallmark for IBS for many years.&#xD;
      We are routinely performing anorectal functions tests in our specialized unit. Recently we&#xD;
      validated high-resolution anorectal manometry and rapid barostat bag measurements to assess&#xD;
      visceral sensitivity; in a further study we assessed obstructive defecation when compared to&#xD;
      magnetic resonance defecography. In an earlier study employing magnetic resonance&#xD;
      defecography (MR defecography) we were able to show that MR defecography, apart from&#xD;
      correlating well with the diagnosis of dyssynergic defecation suggested by anorectal&#xD;
      manometry, additional pelvic floor abnormalities such as pelvic floor descent, cystocele and&#xD;
      enterocele could be identified. Studying these measures in patients with suspected outlet&#xD;
      obstruction in relation to JHS status, which is considered a risk factor for pelvic floor&#xD;
      abnormalities, might lead to more focused diagnostic and therapeutic approaches in the future&#xD;
      for patients who profit most from certain procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Considering all above mentioned facts we are going to carry out a study analyzing different&#xD;
      subtypes of FGID (in particular IBS, FD, functional abdominal pain/bloating) for&#xD;
      demographics, clinical diagnostics (e.g. nutrient challenge testing, microbiome testing,&#xD;
      anorectal manometry and MR defecography), treatment (FODMAP diet) and comorbidities (in&#xD;
      particular JH, JHS and psychological comorbidities) to identify FGID patients which profit&#xD;
      most from different diagnostics and FODMAP diet.&#xD;
