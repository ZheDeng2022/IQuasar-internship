  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      AlphaMedix™ (²¹²Pb-DOTAMTATE) is a radiotherapeutic drug indicated in subjects with&#xD;
      unresectable, metastatic somatostatin receptor (SSTR) positive neuroendocrine tumors (NETs).&#xD;
      Because 212Pb is an in vivo generator of alpha particles, it is particularly suitable for&#xD;
      SSTR therapy applications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This drug addresses an unmet need in the field of peptide receptor radionuclide therapy&#xD;
      (PRRT) for NETs. Substitution of an alpha emitter (²¹²Pb) for the beta emitters currently&#xD;
      being used (i.e., 177Lu or 90Y) will provide significantly higher Linear Energy Transfer&#xD;
      (LET) and a shorter path length. Higher LET particles should cause more tumor cell death.&#xD;
      Shorter path length should result in less collateral damage of the normal tissue and&#xD;
      therefore less side effects for subjects receiving the drug.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This dose escalation study will include a maximum of 50 subjects with histologically&#xD;
      confirmed NET, a positive somatostatin analogue scan, and no prior history of PRRT therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will begin with a single ascending dose (SAD) of AlphaMedix™ administered by IV.&#xD;
      Subsequent cohorts will receive an incremental 30% increase that will continue until tumor&#xD;
      response or DLT. Once tumor response is observed, the study will convert to a Multiple&#xD;
      Ascending Dose (MAD) regimen. The MAD treatment regimen will start with the previous safe&#xD;
      cohort's dose and will consist of 3 IV administrations of AlphaMedix™ at 8-week intervals.&#xD;
      Subsequent cohorts will receive an incremental 30% increase that will continue until tumor&#xD;
      response or DLT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective is to assess the safety and dose limiting toxicity (DLT) using&#xD;
      ascending doses of AlphaMedix™. The secondary objectives are to determine the pharmacokinetic&#xD;
      properties and preliminary effectiveness of AlphaMedix™.&#xD;
