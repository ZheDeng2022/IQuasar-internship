  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Intracorporeal urinary diversion (ICD) provides superior postoperative outcomes compared to&#xD;
      extracorporeal urinary diversion (ECD). The investigators' hypothesis that ICD may provide&#xD;
      clinical benefit is based on principles of less bowel and ureteral handling, superior&#xD;
      operating room workflow, less exposure to the external environment, and optimal visualization&#xD;
      with ICD while utilizing a smaller incision compared to ECD. ICD should have less&#xD;
      bowel-related complications, lower pain scores allowing patients to be discharged from the&#xD;
      hospital sooner and regain functional independence more quickly.&#xD;

    <measure>Health-Related Quality of Life (HRQoL) as assessed by SF-8 Health Survey</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 36 months</time_frame>
    <description>HRQoL measured by patient scores on the Short Form 8 (SF-8) Health Survey. The SF-8 is a questionnaire consisting of 8-items and two component summary scores: Physical component summary (PCS) and mental component summary (MCS). They are scored by weighting each score to a norm-based scoring model. The total scores will be reported as a percentile with higher score indicating better health-related quality of life.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>HRQoL as assessed by the FACT-VCI Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 36 months</time_frame>
    <description>HRQoL measured by patient scores on the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Vanderbilt Cystectomy Index (FACT-VCI) questionnaire. The FACT-VCI is a condition-specific instrument for patients undergoing radical cystectomy (RC) and urinary diversion (UD) for bladder cancer. The questionnaire consists of 44 items scored on a range from 0 (&quot;Not at all&quot;) to 4 (&quot;Very Much&quot;), resulting in an ordinal Likert scale, with higher scores indicating a better HRQoL. The FACT-VCI measures quality of life across five domains: Physical wellbeing, social/family wellbeing, emotional wellbeing, functional wellbeing and an additional concerns subscale.</description>
