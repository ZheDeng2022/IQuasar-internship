  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The human metapneumovirus (hMPV) was first described in 2001. It belongs to the paramyxovirus&#xD;
      family and is genetically close to the Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV). hMPV has a seasonal&#xD;
      epidemic pattern, between January to April. Clinical symptoms of hMPV infection include&#xD;
      influenza-like illness (fever, asthenia and curvatures) associated with signs of respiratory&#xD;
      tract infection. The incidence of hMPV infection is higher in children than in adults. In&#xD;
      child pneumonia, hMPV is the third most frequent isolated pathogen (14 % of the subjects),&#xD;
      after rhinovirus and RSV. In hospitalized adults, hMPV was detected in 6 to 8% of the&#xD;
      subjects with lower respiratory tract and in 4 % of subjects with pneumonia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical, radiological and biological features, as well as evolution course of hMPV&#xD;
      infections have been mainly described in children. Clinical presentation of in adult seems&#xD;
      polymorph, ranging from acute bronchitis or exacerbation of COPD to pneumonia. The frequency&#xD;
      of viral-bacterial coinfection is unknown. Intensive care unit (ICU) admission may involve&#xD;
      almost 1 for 10 patients. Elderly and immunocompromised subjects are probably high-risk&#xD;
      subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently, treatment of hMPV infections is mainly symptomatic. However, several anti-RSV&#xD;
      drugs that are currently in clinical development have demonstrated an activity against other&#xD;
      paramyxoviridae in pre-clinical studies. Consequently, it seems necessary to better&#xD;
      characterize hMPV infections in adult inpatients: presentation, course profile and risk&#xD;
      factors for morbidity and mortality. These data would help clinicians to identify high risk&#xD;
      patients, and consequently to choose those who could benefit from coming treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The French hMPV Study is observational prospective multicenter clinical study. The study&#xD;
      population includes all consecutive adult inpatients with a community-acquired acute lower&#xD;
      respiratory tract infection and a mPCR positive for hMPV on any respiratory sample. The&#xD;
      primary objective is to describe the prognosis. The secondary objectives are i) to&#xD;
      characterize clinical, radiological and biological features, ii) to describe the hospital&#xD;
      course and the rate of ICU transfer; in ICU patients, to describe organ failures and&#xD;
      supports, and iii) to describe the viral and/or bacterial coinfections. The primary endpoint&#xD;
      is the number of subjects with a poor outcome (defined by the requirement for invasive&#xD;
      mechanical ventilation and/or the death during the hospital stay).&#xD;

      The human metapneumovirus (hMPV) was first described in 2001. It belongs to the paramyxovirus&#xD;
      family (paramyxoviridae subfamily). hMPV is genetically close to the Respiratory Syncytial&#xD;
      Virus (RSV). hMPV has a seasonal epidemic pattern, between January to April. Incubation&#xD;
      period varies between 4 and 6 days. Clinical symptoms of hMPV infection are close to that of&#xD;
      RSV, with influenza-like illness (fever, asthenia and curvatures) associated with signs of&#xD;
      upper and/or lower respiratory tracts infection. The incidence of hMPV infection is higher in&#xD;
      children than in adults. In a large cohort of children with respiratory illness or fever,&#xD;
      hMPV was detected in 7 % of outpatients and 6 % of hospitalized children. The annual rate of&#xD;
      hospitalization associated with hMPV infection has been estimated about 1 per 1000 children&#xD;
      less than 5 years of age. In child pneumonia, hMPV is the third most frequent isolated&#xD;
      pathogen (14 % of the subjects), after rhinovirus and RSV. In hospitalized adults, hMPV was&#xD;
      detect in 6 to 8% of the subjects with a lower respiratory tract and in 4 % of subjects with&#xD;
      a pneumonia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical, radiological and biological features, as well as evolution course of&#xD;
      hMPV-associated infections have been mainly described in children. Clinical presentation of&#xD;
      hMPV-associated infection in adult seems polymorph, ranging from acute bronchitis or&#xD;
      exacerbation of chronic pulmonary diseases (COPD and asthma) to pneumonia. Viral-viral&#xD;
      coinfections are not exceptional whereas the frequency of viral-bacterial coinfection is&#xD;
      unknown. Intensive care unit (ICU) admission involved almost 1 for 10 patients. Elderly and&#xD;
      immunocompromised subjects are probably high-risk subjects. Only one cohort of hMPV-infected&#xD;
      patients admitted to ICU has been reported. Among the 40 patients, 6 were&#xD;
      non-immunocompromised and without comorbidity. Factors associated with a poor prognosis were&#xD;
      not studied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently, treatment of hMPV-associated lower respiratory tract infections is mainly&#xD;
      symptomatic. However, several anti-RSV drugs that are currently in clinical development in&#xD;
      humans, have demonstrated an activity against other paramyxoviridae (hMPV and parainfluenza&#xD;
      virus) in pre-clinical studies. These anti-RSV drugs should be available for clinicians in&#xD;
      the next few years. Considering their activity against other paramyxoviridae, clinicians will&#xD;
      probably attempt to use these anti-RSV drugs in non-RSV paramyxoviridae-associated lower&#xD;
      respiratory tracts infections in adult inpatients. Consequently, it seems necessary to better&#xD;
      characterize hMPV-associated lower respiratory tracts infections in adult inpatients:&#xD;
      clinical, radiological and biological presentation, course profile and risk factors for&#xD;
      morbidity and mortality. These data would help clinicians to identify high risk patients, and&#xD;
      consequently to choose those who could benefit from coming treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The French hMPV Study is observational prospective multicenter clinical study. The study&#xD;
      population includes all consecutive adult inpatients with a community-acquired acute lower&#xD;
      respiratory tract infection and a mPCR positive for hMPV on any respiratory sample. The&#xD;
      primary objective is to describe the prognosis. The secondary objectives are i) to&#xD;
      characterize the clinical (time from onset to hospital admission, general symptoms,&#xD;
      respiratory symptoms and signs), radiological and biological features, ii) to describe the&#xD;
      hospital course and the rate of ICU transfer; in ICU patients, to describe organ failures and&#xD;
      supports, and iii) to describe the viral and/or bacterial coinfections.&#xD;
