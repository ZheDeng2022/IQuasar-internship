    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to address critical safety questions with concurrent&#xD;
      TDF-based PrEP and DMPA use. We hypothesize that young women using TDF-based PrEP and DMPA&#xD;
      will have lower bone acquisition and altered bone metabolism. Bone mineral metabolism is in&#xD;
      part regulated by the kidney, and we hypothesize that bone effects from concurrent PrEP and&#xD;
      DMPA use will be driven by subclinical kidney injury, a known side effect of TDF, as well as&#xD;
      DMPA-induced hypoestrogenism. To investigate our hypothesis, we will enroll a prospective&#xD;
      cohort of approximately 500 HIV-uninfected women ages 16-25 years in Kampala, Uganda who have&#xD;
      substantial HIV risk and are initiating DMPA or barrier method contraception. Over a 24-month&#xD;
      period, we will offer TDF-based PrEP. We will use state-of-the-art radiologic, biochemical,&#xD;
      and epidemiologic methods to test the hypothesis that concurrent TDF-based PrEP and DMPA use&#xD;
      results in compounding adverse effects on bone health.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The proposed research will investigate the hypothesis that TDF-based PrEP and DMPA initiated&#xD;
      concurrently by HIV-uninfected women will enhance each other's effects on bone metabolism.&#xD;
      The investigators will conduct an open-label prospective study of approximately 500&#xD;
      HIV-uninfected women at substantial risk for HIV-infection who are newly initiating DMPA or&#xD;
      using condoms as their only contraceptive in Kampala, Uganda. The investigators will offer&#xD;
      PrEP to all of these women and determine the joint effect of PrEP and DMPA on changes in bone&#xD;
      mass (Aim 1), bone turnover, subclinical kidney injury, and hypoestrogenism (Aim 2), and&#xD;
      conduct mediation analysis to assess the contribution of each pathway to overall losses in&#xD;
      bone mass (Aim 3).&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The investigators will assess whether young women using TDF-based PrEP and DMPA&#xD;
           concurrently attain lower peak bone mass over a 24-month period and have evidence of&#xD;
           disrupted microarchitecture, relative to women using either agent singly or neither&#xD;
           agent The investigators will use dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) scans to measure&#xD;
           BMD annually at 3 anatomical sites (lumbar spine, total hip, and wrist). Additionally,&#xD;
           the investigators will derive the trabecular bone score (TBS), an index of lumbar spine&#xD;
           trabecular microarchitecture.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The investigators will investigate whether young women concurrently using TDF-based PrEP&#xD;
           and DMPA experience: 1) higher rates of bone turnover, a direct precursor to bone loss&#xD;
           and 2) subclinical kidney injury and hypoestrogenism, markers of two mechanistic&#xD;
           pathways between TDF and DMPA use and bone mass&#xD;
&#xD;
      At baseline and 24 months, the investigators will measure:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Markers of bone formation and resorption (e.g. NTX, P1NP, serum intact parathyroid&#xD;
           hormone, total and bioavailable 25-OH-vitamin D)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Markers of kidney function (phosphate, glucose, creatinine, total protein, albumin) and&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Markers of estrogen (serum estradiol, sex hormone binding protein, and the occurrence of&#xD;
           amenorrhea) Hypothesis: Relative to women using DMPA only and PrEP only, women&#xD;
           concurrently using TDF-based PrEP and DMPA will have increased bone turnover markers and&#xD;
           PTH. In addition, women concurrently using TDF-based PrEP and DMPA will have more&#xD;
           frequent subclinical kidney injury (relative to women without tenofovir exposure) and&#xD;
           reduced serum estrogen (relative to women without DMPA exposure).&#xD;
&#xD;
      3. Using mediation analysis, the investigators will identify the degree to which the pathways&#xD;
      through subclinical kidney injury and hypoestrogenism account for changes in bone density&#xD;
      among women concurrently using TDF-based PrEP and DMPA The investigators will conduct&#xD;
      mediation analysis to determine the degree to which changes in the pathways through&#xD;
      subclinical kidney injury, hypoestrogenism and the combination of these pathways account for&#xD;
      changes in bone density.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Over a 24-month period, the investigators will follow women quarterly with HIV rapid testing,&#xD;
      PrEP adherence counseling and refills, DMPA injections, and provision of other contraceptives&#xD;
      as desired. At enrollment and quarterly visits, the investigators will assess physical&#xD;
      activity, sexual behavior, and menstrual cycle characteristics. Annually, the investigators&#xD;
      will conduct physical exams and anthropometric readings. Sexually transmitted infections will&#xD;
      be routinely assessed syndromically, according to national guidelines. Women will be&#xD;
      encouraged to consider their HIV risk and fertility desires at every visit and counseled&#xD;
      about contraception and PrEP accordingly. Dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) scans will&#xD;
      be performed at baseline and annually thereafter. Blood and urine samples will be obtained&#xD;
      quarterly, aliquoted, and archived at minus 80o Celsius.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DXA and TBS assessments:&#xD;
&#xD;
      DXA scans will be conducted at study enrollment (within 1 week of contraceptive initiation),&#xD;
      12, and 24 months after enrollment. DXA is the clinical standard for measuring BMD. It is&#xD;
      painless and non-invasive. Women will be exposed to a relatively low level of radiation which&#xD;
      is &lt;1/10 the dose of a standard chest x-ray, and less than a day's exposure to natural&#xD;
      radiation. BMD by DXA of the hip and spine is generally considered the most reliable way to&#xD;
      classify osteoporosis, assess changes in BMD, and predict fracture risk. The investigators&#xD;
      will measure areal BMD of the lumbar spine (L1-4), hip, and wrist, and body composition&#xD;
      (total and % fat and lean mass) using a DXA machine. For the TBS analysis, no additional&#xD;
      image acquisition is required. TBS will be performed as a re-analysis of the lumbar spine&#xD;
      taken as part of the standard DXA procedure with specialized software.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Contraceptive provision:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Women will initiate contraception at the study clinic or a family planning clinic, as they&#xD;
      are seeking services. Throughout study follow up, the study will assume responsibility for&#xD;
      contraceptive provision, including DMPA injections, and care of all other methods desired by&#xD;
      women. The staff at the IDI-Kasangati research clinic have extensive experience with the&#xD;
      provision of contraception and contraceptive counseling during previous HIV prevention&#xD;
      studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PrEP provision and adherence monitoring&#xD;
&#xD;
      Co-formulated emtricitabine FTC/TDF will be provided as PrEP by the study. PrEP counseling&#xD;
      and provision will follow WHO guidelines, or Ugandan clinical guidelines when they are&#xD;
      available. The investigators will measure adherence using three different methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Pill counts will be conducted by the pharmacist during study visits to determine the&#xD;
           percentage of expected pills that were used&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Real time monitoring will be conducted using an electronic monitoring system that&#xD;
           captures a date-time stamp each time the pill container is opened&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. The primary circulating form of TDF, tenofovir (TFV), will be quantified in blood&#xD;
           archives from 1) a random sample of up to 15% of women who initiate PrEP to characterize&#xD;
           the adherence in the cohort overall and 2) a targeted group of women who have no BMD&#xD;
           change and women who experience a fracture.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Laboratory processing to measure markers of bone turnover, subclinical kidney injury, and&#xD;
      hypoestrogenism.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Using state-of-the-art assay techniques on archival samples, the investigators will measure&#xD;
      1) established markers of bone turnover and bone health, 2) markers of subclinical kidney&#xD;
      injury, and 3) markers of hypoestrogenism. Archived samples will be batch-analyzed.&#xD;
