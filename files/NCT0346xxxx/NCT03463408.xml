      Immunotherapy + Radiation in Resectable Soft Tissue Sarcoma&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A single institution two cohort, open label, non-randomized study of neoadjuvant nivolumab&#xD;
      and ipilimumab with concurrent radiation followed by surgical resection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cohort A will comprise adult soft tissue sarcoma patents who consent to and receive&#xD;
      ipilimumab + nivolumab concurrently with standard of care radiation. Ipilimumab will be given&#xD;
      at a dose of 1 mg/kg every 6 weeks (total two doses) and nivolumab given as a flat dose of&#xD;
      240 mg every 2 weeks (total four doses).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cohort B will comprise patients eligible for the trial who do not wish to receive&#xD;
      immunotherapy but consent to the same blood draws, surveys, and specimen analysis as Cohort&#xD;
      A. Cohort B will serve as a non-randomized but pragmatic and clinically relevant control&#xD;
      group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Peripheral blood will be collected on day 1 pre-treatment, day 14, day 42, immediately prior&#xD;
      to surgery, and at 3 month follow up. Peripheral blood will be sent for multidimensional flow&#xD;
      analysis of changes in immune cell composition and markers of proliferation. Serum samples&#xD;
      will be obtained before starting treatment and after surgery. Samples from select subjects&#xD;
      whose resected tumors show significant response and whose tumors showed minimal response will&#xD;
      be sent to Serametrix for serum profiling to detect antibody response to a panel of&#xD;
      tumor-specific antigens.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Standard surgical resection will be done 2 to 4 weeks after completion of radiotherapy.&#xD;
      Accrual is expected to occur over 2 years. Follow up data will be collected for up to 3 years&#xD;
      post-treatment.&#xD;
