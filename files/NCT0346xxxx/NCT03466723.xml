  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      microRNAs (miRNAs) regulate fundamental cell processes. Dysregulation of miRNA expression and&#xD;
      function is reported in various diseases including cancer, metabolic disorders as well as&#xD;
      neurological disorders. Circulating miRNAs have been proposed to mirror physiological and&#xD;
      pathological conditions suggesting their use as biomarkers for various diseases. The study&#xD;
      will focus on a case-control study cohort (N=1000) of subjects recruited at the IRCCS&#xD;
      Neuromed for which a deep clinical characterization and genome-wide sequencing data are&#xD;
      available. This study will enable to identify novel circulating biomarkers for Parkinson's&#xD;
      disease (PD). Further, the project will give new insights on the involvement of miRNAs in the&#xD;
      etiology of PD and in the understanding of the genetics of the disease thus opening avenues&#xD;
      for novel therapeutic strategies.&#xD;

      Hypothesis and Significance:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The project intends to identify novel biomarkers for PD and clinical parameters related to&#xD;
      the PD etiology. To do that circulating miRNA profiling through a next-generation sequencing&#xD;
      will be performed using a single sample approach in the case-control study cohort and&#xD;
      identified miRNAs will be validated by qRT-PCR and functional analyses. In addition, the&#xD;
      project will contribute expanding the knowledge of the genetic architecture of PD taking&#xD;
      advantage of genetic characterization of the study sample. miRNA genes and target genes will&#xD;
      be used to prioritize genetic variants to be tested for association with PD to detect novel&#xD;
      genes and functional variants that confer disease risk.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 1:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Profile of circulating miRNAs in the serum of PD patients and controls by next-generation&#xD;
      sequencing in individual samples. Correlation between identified miRNAs and PD-related&#xD;
      parameters and validation in independent cohorts&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 2:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bioinformatics prediction of target genes and miRNA functional validation&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 3:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Identification of genes/genetic variants in miRNA pathways predisposing to PD&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expected outcomes:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will allow to discover novel circulating miRNAs as biomarkers for Parkinson's&#xD;
      disease. As the deep phenotype characterization of the study sample, the project expects to&#xD;
      find new associations of identified miRNAs with disease-related parameters and define the&#xD;
      role of miRNAs in the physiological pathways in which those parameters are involved and in&#xD;
      the etiology of PD. Also, the understanding of the genetics of the disease will open avenues&#xD;
      for novel therapeutic strategies.&#xD;

        Collection of 1000 case-control study samples with a large phenotype and genotype&#xD;
        characterization. The study includes 500 PD patients and 500 age/gender-matched controls.&#xD;
        All PD patients have been diagnosed at the IRCCS Neuromed and followed-up (at least for 5&#xD;
        years) for disease progression. Data collected from patients and unrelated controls&#xD;
        include: socio-demographic status, life style, anamnesis and family history, exposure to&#xD;
        toxic chemical and/or environmental agents. Patients have been studied with a protocol&#xD;
        comprising neurological examination (Stadio di Hoehn and Yahr, MDS-UPDRS part III, MOCA&#xD;
        test) and evaluation of no motor symptoms. Information about drugs therapy have been also&#xD;
        collected.&#xD;
