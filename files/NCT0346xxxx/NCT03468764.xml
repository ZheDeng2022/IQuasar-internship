  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Intraoperative hemodynamic management is important, since even mild variations in circulatory&#xD;
      volume can be extremely damaging for patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Minimally invasive hemodynamic monitoring are not always available or cost-effective,&#xD;
      therefore management of fluids is challenging for anesthesiologists.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aims to assess if, after performance of a lung recruitment maneuver (LRM),&#xD;
      standard parameter's variation differs between hypovolemic and normovolemic patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients' volemic state will be assessed with the Vigileo system. Standard monitoring values&#xD;
      (heart rate, invasive blood pressure and saturation) will be registered before and after&#xD;
      LRMs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A fluid challenge will be performed and the above mentioned parameters will be recorded&#xD;
      again, after a second LRM.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is a prospective observational study.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      During general anesthesia, it's important to maintain normovolemia, since hypovolemia can&#xD;
      cause inadequate tissue perfusion and hypervolemia increases the rate of complications,&#xD;
      overall mortality and morbidity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Critically ill patients commonly present with important hypotension that, in the majority of&#xD;
      cases, is promptly treated with intravenous fluids to reverse organ hypoperfusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, previous studies have demonstrated that only 50% of hemodynamically unstable&#xD;
      patients are responsive to fluid administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the last decade, attention has been focused on finding a parameter capable of assessing&#xD;
      fluid responsiveness in a hypotensive patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recent articles have demonstrated that standard monitoring parameters have no significance&#xD;
      for this purpose, while hemodynamic parameters, like stroke volume variation (SVV) or pulse&#xD;
      pressure variation (PVV) may have an important role.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An interesting field of research involves heart-lung interactions during mechanical&#xD;
      ventilation. In particular, lung recruitment maneuver (LRM) induce physiological&#xD;
      cardiovascular alterations and may have a correlation with the volemic state of the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      LRMs are commonly performed and safe procedures that consist in application of a continuous&#xD;
      positive pressure in the lungs of mechanically ventilated patient, with the aim of improving&#xD;
      pulmonary compliance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goal of our study is to verify whether the alterations induced by lung recruitment&#xD;
      maneuver on commonly registered intraoperative parameters, such as heart rate and arterial&#xD;
      blood pressure, actually differ when the maneuver is applied to hypovolemic and normovolemic&#xD;
      patients respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients undergoing scheduled laparoscopic colon surgery will be enrolled. Informed consent&#xD;
      will be obtained during the preoperative anesthesiological visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      General anaesthesia will be managed according to standard clinical practice. Invasive blood&#xD;
      pressure monitoring will be started with a peripheral arterial catheter and hemodynamic&#xD;
      parameters (SVV and CO) will be monitored through the Vigileo device.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the resection phase, the patient has to be maintained in hypovolemic conditions. When&#xD;
      SVV reaches a value of 12-15%, a LRM is performed, consisting in the application of 30 cm H2O&#xD;
      continuous positive airway pressure for 30 seconds.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Standard monitoring values (heart rate, invasive blood pressure and saturation) will be&#xD;
      registered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thereafter, a fluid challenge will be performed, consisting in intravenous administration of&#xD;
      8 ml/kg of saline solution over 20 minutes. As soon as SVV will reach a value of 10%, LRM&#xD;
      will be performed again and the abovementioned three sets of measurements will be carried out&#xD;
      once again.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As standard management of LRM, the maneuver will be stopped if the heart rate would lower&#xD;
      below 35 bpm or the systolic blood pressure would lower below 60 mmHg.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The information provided by the study is of interest in cases in which the deployment of&#xD;
      sophisticated monitoring, as the Vigileo system, is not feasible or cost-effective. In this&#xD;
      way, hemodynamic management during major surgeries would become faster and easier, relying on&#xD;
      traditional monitoring.&#xD;

    <description>Standard monitoring parameters, invasive blood pressure and hemodynamic values (SVV and CO, through Vigileo device) will be monitored. With the patient in a supine position and as SVV reaches a value of 12-15%, a LRM is performed, consisting in the application of 30 cm H2O continuous positive airway pressure for 30 seconds.&#xD;
The alterations in the above mentioned parameters will be registered before and after the maneuver.&#xD;
The same procedure will be performed after a 8 ml/kg crystalloids fluid challenge, as soon as SVV reaches the value of 10%.</description>
