    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1, single-center, open-label, three consecutive dosing periods study to&#xD;
      evaluate the drug-drug interaction, PK, safety, tolerability and PD of a single dose of&#xD;
      EYP100a combined with ETV in healthy men and women. Sixteen (16) adult male and female&#xD;
      healthy participants 18 to 60 years of age inclusive are planned to participate in the study.&#xD;
      Women of childbearing potential will be eligible to participate if she is non pregnant or non&#xD;
      lactating and willing to use adequate contraception.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants in the study will be monitored for safety after administration of the last&#xD;
      dose of investigational product and with a follow up visit. The DDI, PK, PD, safety and&#xD;
      tolerability of EYP001a and ETV will be assessed based on plasma-concentration profiles of&#xD;
      EYP001a and ETV, FXR related PD markers and the types and frequency of treatment-emergent&#xD;
      adverse events (TEAEs) reported, concomitant medication usage, and changes from baseline in&#xD;
      physical examination (PE), vital signs, electrocardiogram (ECG), and standard clinical&#xD;
      laboratory tests.&#xD;
