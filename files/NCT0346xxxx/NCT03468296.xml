  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of every 2 week intravitreal&#xD;
      aflibercept injections in a population of neovascular AMD patients that have demonstrated&#xD;
      refractory subretinal fluid with or without intraretinal fluid despite prior monthly&#xD;
      intravitreal aflibercept treatment.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Eligible patients will be scheduled to receive intravitreal aflibercept (2.0mg) injections&#xD;
      for six consecutive 2 week (13-15 days) intervals with injections administered at weeks 0, 2,&#xD;
      4, 6, 8, 10, and 12. The primary endpoint visit to assess response to sustained q2week&#xD;
      therapy will be at the week 14 visit. No treatment will be administered at this visit. All&#xD;
      patients will then return at week 16 for the randomization visit and receive a repeat&#xD;
      intravitreal aflibercept (2.0mg) injection. For purposes of randomization, patients will be&#xD;
      separated into the following groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Q2 week complete responders: absence of subretinal fluid on OCT at week 16&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Q2 week incomplete responders: persistent subretinal fluid on OCT at week 16&#xD;
&#xD;
      The &quot;q2 week complete responders&quot; will subsequently be transitioned to a treat and extend&#xD;
      regimen with a minimum inter-treatment interval of 4 weeks through week 24. The &quot;q2 week&#xD;
      incomplete responders&quot; will be randomized in a 1:1 fashion into one of two arms:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Continued q2 week treatment: intravitreal aflibercept (2.0mg) injections for an&#xD;
           additional four consecutive 2 week intervals at weeks 18, 20, 22, and 24&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Transition to treat-and-extend treatment: through week 24 with a minimum inter-treatment&#xD;
           interval of q4 weeks. This arm is identical to regimen for &quot;q2 week complete&#xD;
           responders.&quot;&#xD;
&#xD;
      Beginning in week 24, all patients (all groups) will undergo treatment delivered on a&#xD;
      treat-and-extend basis with a minimum inter-treatment interval of 4 weeks through the week&#xD;
      50. Patient visits will be treated no more frequent than q4 weeks during treat-and-extend&#xD;
      portions of the protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will have a mandatory study termination visit at week 52 (-1/+2 weeks). No study&#xD;
      treatment will be administered after week 50. Patients receiving a study treatment after week&#xD;
      48 will return 4 weeks after this final study treatment for study termination visit. Patients&#xD;
      receiving a study treatment at or before week 48 in whom the treat-and-extend protocol would&#xD;
      dictate a subsequent visit after week 52 will instead return at week 52 for a study&#xD;
      termination visit.&#xD;
