  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the safety and effectiveness of nivolumab alone or&#xD;
      in combination with ipilimumab in patients with metastatic or unresectable tumors harbouring&#xD;
      mutations in genes, POLE and POLD1. These mutations will be determined by plasma cfDNA.&#xD;
      Nivolumab and ipilimumab have been given to patients across multiple types of cancer, and&#xD;
      safe doses and schedules have been determined.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Participants in this study have been diagnosed with metastatic or unresectable solid tumors&#xD;
      that have a mutation in POLE and/or POLD1. Nivolumab alone or in conjunction with ipilimumab&#xD;
      is predicted to be effective against tumors with POLE and/or POLD1 mutations as these genetic&#xD;
      changes cause increased rates of mutations in the DNA of tumor cells. These high mutation&#xD;
      rates have been associated with response to immunotherapy agents such as nivolumab and&#xD;
      ipilimumab.&#xD;
