    <textblock>
      Emerging evidence demonstrates that animals and people can exert control over the level of&#xD;
      excitability in spinal and corticospinal neural circuits that contribute to movement. This&#xD;
      discovery has important implications, as it represents a new strategy to improve motor&#xD;
      control in people of all ability levels, including those with neurological conditions.&#xD;
      Operant conditioning is a well-studied mechanism of learning, in which the modification of a&#xD;
      behavior can be brought about by the consequence of the behavior, and reinforcement causes&#xD;
      behaviors to become more frequent. In recent years, operant conditioning has been applied to&#xD;
      spinally-mediated reflex responses in mice, rats, monkeys and people. By electrically&#xD;
      stimulating a peripheral nerve, recording the muscle response, and rewarding responses that&#xD;
      are within a desirable range, it is possible to increase or decrease the neural circuit's&#xD;
      excitability. This may alter the level of resting muscle tone and spasticity, as well the&#xD;
      muscle's contribution to planned movements and responses to unexpected events. Operant&#xD;
      conditioning of spinal reflexes has been applied to a lower limb muscle in healthy people and&#xD;
      those with spinal cord injuries. In this project, we will expand the use of operant&#xD;
      conditioning to muscles of the upper limb, demonstrating feasibility and efficacy in healthy&#xD;
      people and people post-stroke. We will determine whether operant conditioning can be used to&#xD;
      decrease excitability of spinal reflexes that activate a wrist flexor muscle. Additionally,&#xD;
      in a separate group of healthy people, we will determine whether operant conditioning can be&#xD;
      used in a similar way to increase corticospinal excitability. We will stimulate the motor&#xD;
      cortex with transcranial magnetic stimulation to elicit motor evoked potentials in the same&#xD;
      wrist flexor muscle, and will reward responses that exceed a threshold value. We will examine&#xD;
      the effects of these interventions on motor control at the wrist, using an innovative&#xD;
      custom-designed cursor-tracking task to quantify movement performance. We will determine&#xD;
      whether changes in spinal reflex excitability or corticospinal excitability alter motor&#xD;
      control. The overall goal of this research is to develop a new, evidence-based strategy for&#xD;
      rehabilitation that will improve recovery of upper limb function in people after stroke.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate neuromodulation as new approach to enhance&#xD;
      rehabilitation for people who have upper limb movement impairment after neurological injury&#xD;
      such as stroke or spinal cord injury. Emerging evidence demonstrates that animals and people&#xD;
      can exert control over the level of excitability in neural pathways that contribute to&#xD;
      movement. This discovery has important implications, as it represents a new strategy to&#xD;
      improve motor control in people of all ability levels, including those with neurological&#xD;
      conditions. Operant conditioning is a well-studied mechanism of learning, in which the&#xD;
      modification of a behavior can be brought about by the consequence of the behavior. Behaviors&#xD;
      that are rewarded with positive reinforcement are displayed more frequently. In recent years,&#xD;
      operant conditioning has been applied to spinal reflex responses in mice, rats, monkeys and&#xD;
      people. Evidence suggests that it is possible to increase or decrease a neural circuit's&#xD;
      excitability, by electrically stimulating a nerve or an area of the brain, then recording the&#xD;
      muscle response and rewarding responses that are within a desirable range. This may alter the&#xD;
      level of resting muscle tone, as well the muscle's contribution to intentional movements and&#xD;
      its readiness to respond to unexpected perturbations. To date, only one research group has&#xD;
      applied operant conditioning to improve motor performance in people. Their work has focused&#xD;
      on modifying spinal reflexes for a lower limb muscle and the effects on walking. In the&#xD;
      proposed project, we will expand the use of operant conditioning to muscles of the upper limb&#xD;
      and to people with movement impairment following stroke and spinal cord injury, and to&#xD;
      another neural pathway in addition to the spinal reflex.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will include procedures necessary to measure excitability of the nervous system at&#xD;
      the level of the spinal cord and at the level of the brain. Spinal reflex excitability will&#xD;
      be quantified by electrically stimulating a peripheral nerve and recording the muscle&#xD;
      response (ie. the H-reflex) with electromyography. Excitability of the motor pathway from&#xD;
      brain to muscle (the corticospinal tract) will be quantified by stimulating a specific area&#xD;
      of the brain (the motor cortex) with transcranial magnetic stimulation, and recording the&#xD;
      muscle response (ie. The motor evoked potential) with electromyography. In addition, upper&#xD;
      limb movement impairment will be assessed by measuring muscle tone, sensation, ability to&#xD;
      generate force, and performance on a computer-based wrist motor control task. In subjects who&#xD;
      have neurological conditions, upper limb function will be assessed using standardized tests,&#xD;
      including the Fugl-Meyer a assessment of the Upper Extremity, the Action Research Arm Test,&#xD;
      and the Box and Blocks Test. This study will test the effectiveness of operant conditioning&#xD;
      as an intervention to modify neural excitability. After baseline testing, subjects will&#xD;
      participate in up to 12 sessions of sham intervention followed by up to 24 sessions of real&#xD;
      operant conditioning intervention. Each session will include 225 trials (3 sets of 75),&#xD;
      lasting about 30 minutes. For each trial during real intervention, a stimulus will be&#xD;
      delivered while the subject maintains a low level muscle contraction, the muscle's response&#xD;
      to stimulation will be recorded, and immediate feedback will be displayed on a computer&#xD;
      screen, showing the subject whether their muscle response was within the desired range or&#xD;
      not. For example, a green bar will appear if the muscle response was 'good', otherwise a red&#xD;
      bar will appear. The subject's 'percent success' also will be displayed and updated after&#xD;
      each trial. During sham intervention, all procedures will be identical except that no&#xD;
      feedback will be provided to the subject, and there will be no instructions to either&#xD;
      increase or decrease their muscle responses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In healthy people, we will aim to shift spinal reflex excitability (H-reflexes) of an upper&#xD;
      extremity muscle either upward or downward, expanding on previous findings showing those&#xD;
      effects in a lower limb muscle, with no effect on normal movement ability (Thompson et al.,&#xD;
      2009, Makihara et al., 2014). Also in healthy people, we will aim to shift excitability of&#xD;
      the pathway from brain to muscle either upward or downward, using operant conditioning of&#xD;
      motor evoked potentials. Only one prior study (Majid et al., 2015) has demonstrated a&#xD;
      downward shift, and the first studies investigating the ability to increase motor evoked&#xD;
      potentials currently are in progress. People with neurological conditions often have&#xD;
      abnormally increased spinal reflex excitability affecting certain muscles, resulting in&#xD;
      increased tone, stiffness, and difficulty moving. Therefore, we will aim to reduce spinal&#xD;
      reflex excitability in over-active muscles, by eliciting H-reflexes and rewarding responses&#xD;
      that are below a threshold. In addition, people with neurological conditions often have&#xD;
      disrupted connections from brain to muscle, resulting in weakness (diminished ability to&#xD;
      generate force). Therefore, we will aim to increase excitability of the pathway from brain to&#xD;
      muscle, by eliciting motor evoked potentials and rewarding responses that are above a&#xD;
      threshold.&#xD;
