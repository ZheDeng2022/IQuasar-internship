  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: Breathlessness is common through a range of chronic and life limiting diseases,&#xD;
      such as chronic pulmonary disease and congestive hearth failure. There is a lack of knowledge&#xD;
      concerning the understanding of the experience of breathlessness such as the relation between&#xD;
      predicted, experienced and recalled breathlessness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Method: Questions on breathlessness intensity will be asked to participants with&#xD;
      breathlessness several times daily through a mobile application installed on the users own&#xD;
      cellphone. The mean experienced breathlessness will be related to the predicted and the&#xD;
      recalled breathlessness as well as to background factors.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Background&#xD;
&#xD;
      Breathlessness, the subjective sensation of breathing discomfort, is common and appears with&#xD;
      varying severity in daily life of people across a number of diseases such as congestive heart&#xD;
      failure, asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Breathlessness affects&#xD;
      nearly a quarter of people 60+ and about half of patients with serious illness.[1-3]&#xD;
      Breathlessness gives rise to increased anxiety and depression, increased risk of&#xD;
      hospitalization and earlier death.[4]&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical care relies on the patient's history based on his/her symptom recall. The recalled&#xD;
      level of recent breathlessness is used by the health professional in order to decide on the&#xD;
      need for further investigations and treatment. Studies have shown that the recalled intensity&#xD;
      of breathlessness during laboratory-provoked symptoms is not the same as the actually&#xD;
      experienced symptom in daily life.[5] Further, studies has shown lacking communication in&#xD;
      regards to breathlessness between doctor and patients.[7] Knowledge on how recalled intensity&#xD;
      of breathlessness differs to the actual experienced intensity during activities of daily life&#xD;
      is limited.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several factors may influence the recalled symptom intensity including the highest and the&#xD;
      final experienced intensity.[8, 9] A high intensity of breathlessness at the moment of recall&#xD;
      has been correlated with higher recalled intensity than actually experienced during the&#xD;
      period.[10] Also, even a very small decline in cognitive status was shown to influence the&#xD;
      differences between recalled and experienced symptoms.[10]&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aims The primary aim is to evaluate the relationship between experienced breathlessness and&#xD;
      1) recalled (remembered) breathlessness; and 2) predicted future breathlessness. Secondary&#xD;
      aims are to identify factors that influence the difference between experienced and recalled&#xD;
      or predicted breathlessness, estimate the influence of breathlessness on physical activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research questions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Three types of breathlessness measures evaluated: experienced (at a time point), recalled&#xD;
      (remembered) and predicted (future) breathlessness. The main research questions are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. How is the recalled breathlessness intensity for a time period (T1) related to:&#xD;
&#xD;
           1.1. Experienced breathlessness intensity during T1 measured as:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Mean experienced intensity?&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Peak experienced intensity?&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Most recent experienced intensity&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Perceived self-efficacy related to the breathlessness&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Personality trait of high symptom sensitivity at baseline&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Experienced trajectory of breathlessness (including constant; variable; increasing;&#xD;
                decreasing; quick change) 1.2. Predicted breathlessness intensity for a future time&#xD;
                period (T2)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. How is the predicted breathlessness intensity for a subsequent time period (T2) related&#xD;
           to:&#xD;
&#xD;
           2.1 Experienced breathlessness intensity during T1? 2.2 Recalled breathlessness&#xD;
           intensity during T1? 2.3 Experienced breathlessness intensity during T2?&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Which factors are associated with the difference score between:&#xD;
&#xD;
           3.1 Experienced and recalled breathlessness intensity during T1? 3.2 Predicted and&#xD;
           experienced breathlessness intensity during T2?&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Which breathlessness measures are related to physical activity prospectively measured&#xD;
           during a time period (T2): [Clinical sub study]&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Experienced intensity before T2?&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Recalled intensity before T2?&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  The participant's predicted intensity of breathlessness for T2?&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. How do people think when they recall breathlessness over a defined time period (such as&#xD;
           'now', 'last 24 hours' and 'the last week')? [Clinical sub study]&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study procedures&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment Potential participants will be identified by clinical and research staff at the&#xD;
      centers of the participating investigators including primary care and internal&#xD;
      medicine/cardiology departments in Blekinge, Örebro, and Skane University Hospital&#xD;
      (Lund/Malmö). Participants will also be recruited through advertisements in national and&#xD;
      local newspapers and magazines including those of the Swedish Respiratory Society, the&#xD;
      Swedish Heart-Lung Foundation and the Heart-Lung Association, and on web-portals/sites.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility and Consent&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility according to the inclusion and exclusion criteria, consent and study data are&#xD;
      self-entered by the participant using an application on smart phone/pad.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients at the study centers who give their informed written consent will also be included&#xD;
      in a clinical sub study, where additional data will be obtained on cognitive status, physical&#xD;
      activity (using an activity monitor worn for one week), and from medical records, interview&#xD;
      and registry follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Application based data collection&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline data will be recorded when starting the application and daily start and stop times&#xD;
      will be set. At regular intervals during each day, the application will que the participant,&#xD;
      using sound and homepage notifications, to self-rate the intensity of breathlessness during&#xD;
      the last 10-15 minutes. Each que can be ignored or filled in at a later time. Recall of&#xD;
      breathlessness during the preceding night or day and additional measurements are rated in the&#xD;
      application each morning and evening, as well as for the whole week at the end of each week&#xD;
      in the study. The participant can quit the application at any time and will be asked to&#xD;
      complete the cessation/exit assessments for the completed part of the week. All application&#xD;
      data, linked to the participant-specific study-ID, is encrypted and transferred to a central&#xD;
      database in real time via the internet connection. If no Internet connection is available at&#xD;
      the time of transfer or if for some reason the data transfer is interrupted, the data will be&#xD;
      stored locally on the device and the application will try to resend when the connection is&#xD;
      re-established and stabilized. The data will also be kept on the device until the end of the&#xD;
      study to safeguard and create a redundancy. The database is located physically at Blekinge&#xD;
      Institute of Technology and is used for several other clinical studies including Swedish&#xD;
      National Study of Aging and Care in accordance with all relevant protocols for data security&#xD;
      and integrity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical sub study&#xD;
&#xD;
      A subset of participants at the study centres will be asked to participate in a clinical sub&#xD;
      study. In addition to the information regarding the main application-based study these&#xD;
      participants will receive specific information about the sub study on paper and be asked to&#xD;
      give their written informed consent to participate. A log of the study ID, Swedish social&#xD;
      security number (for sub study patients only) is kept at each participating centre. Data&#xD;
      including demographics, diagnoses, measures of pulmonary and cardiac function, treatments,&#xD;
      and hospitalizations will be obtained from medical records and national registries with up to&#xD;
      five years follow-up of diagnoses and hospitalizations (Patient Registry), dispensed&#xD;
      medications (Prescribed Drug Registry) and survival (Causes of Death Registry). Participants&#xD;
      will be asked to fill in a daily diary of the main events causing breathlessness and its&#xD;
      impact during the day. Participants will also be invited to take part in a semi-qualitative&#xD;
      interview focusing on their experience of breathlessness and specifically how they&#xD;
      cognitively recall breathlessness over different time periods such as 'now', 'last 24 hours'&#xD;
      or 'last week' using the study questionnaires and semi-structured qualitative interviews.&#xD;
      This group of participants will also be interviewed shortly about their experiences on using&#xD;
      the mobile application.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Power and Sample Size&#xD;
&#xD;
      To obtain a power of 80% to detect a clinically and statistically significant difference of 1&#xD;
      point on a 0-10 NRS between the mean experienced and the recalled daily breathlessness score,&#xD;
      assuming a pooled standard deviation (SD) of 1.81, a minimum of 30 participants need to be&#xD;
      included. This is consistent with the sample size of Meek et al.[11] To account for loss of&#xD;
      data and ensure adequate power, at least 45 participants with data on 2 days or more will be&#xD;
      included.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethical considerations&#xD;
&#xD;
      Informed consent to participate will be obtained from all participants, including that&#xD;
      participation is entirely voluntary and does not affect care or clinical contacts and that&#xD;
      participation can be discontinued at the discretion of the participant, and that upon&#xD;
      discontinuing, no further data will be collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the application, data are de-identified using a study ID number. For patients who do not&#xD;
      participate in the clinical sub study, the Swedish social security number is not recorded.&#xD;
      For patients in the clinical sub study, clinical data will be cross-linked with data&#xD;
      collected through the application using a key between the study ID (used in the application)&#xD;
      and the participant's Swedish social security number stored securely at the clinical centre.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will be presented on the group level only so that individual participants cannot be&#xD;
      identified. The findings will be published in national and international peer-reviewed&#xD;
      scientific journals. The de-identified data will be posted in open access data repository in&#xD;
      accordance with the requirements of the scientific journal.&#xD;
