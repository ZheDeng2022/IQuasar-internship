  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Classic and endemic Kaposi's sarcoma (KS) are lymphangio-proliferations associated with human&#xD;
      herpes virus 8 (HHV8), which treatment is poorly codified. Chemotherapies give at best 30-60%&#xD;
      of transient responses. While interferon responses are frequent, this drug is often poorly&#xD;
      tolerated in elderly patients. Therefore new therapies are needed. Classic KS represents an&#xD;
      ideal model for evaluating new drugs since patients do not receive concomitant&#xD;
      immunosuppressive regimens nor antiviral therapies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pembrolizumab, an anti-PD1 monoclonal antibody has recently been shown to improve survival in&#xD;
      several solid tumors. In KS few data are available on the role of PD1-PD-L1 axis. A&#xD;
      significant PD-L1 expression on HHV8-associated pleural effusion lymphomas and on KS samples&#xD;
      have been recently reported. Our experience in classical and endemic KS supports the role of&#xD;
      this pathway with expression of PD-L1 by subpopulations of T cells but also NK cells in&#xD;
      peripheral blood cells from these patients and expression of PD-L1 by tumor cells in KS&#xD;
      lesions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study we will evaluate the benefit and safety profile of pembrolizumab in classic and&#xD;
      endemic KS.&#xD;
