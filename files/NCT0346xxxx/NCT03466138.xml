      The proposed study is designed to further demonstrate the performance of the Nociception&#xD;
      Level (NoL) Index - in surgical patient under general anesthesia, by evaluating its response&#xD;
      to controlled changes in the levels of noxious stimuli/analgesia and to correlate early&#xD;
      outcome predictors to the NoL values throughout the surgical procedure, thus provide the&#xD;
      medical caregiver general recommendations on how to interpret the NoL Index in terms of&#xD;
      magnitude and direction, and how to utilize it during the surgical procedure.&#xD;

      The proposed study is designed to further demonstrate the performance of the NoL Index in&#xD;
      surgical patient under general anesthesia, by evaluating its response to controlled changes&#xD;
      in the levels of noxious stimuli/analgesia mentioned characteristics and to correlate early&#xD;
      outcome predictors to the NoL values throughout the surgical procedure, thus provide the&#xD;
      medical caregiver general recommendations on how to interpret the NoL Index in terms of&#xD;
      magnitude and direction, and how to utilize it during the surgical procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study the investigators plan to demonstrate that the NoL Index is a continuous index.&#xD;
      It is anticipated that a higher level of nociception will correspond to a higher NoL index.&#xD;
      On the other hand, it is anticipated that higher levels of analgesic agent for the same&#xD;
      noxious stimulus will lead to a lower NoL index. This will be achieved by measuring the NoL&#xD;
      response to various types of noxious stimuli, varying in their intensities, under different&#xD;
      levels of analgesic agents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The noxious stimuli that will be used in this pivotal study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. - Intubation&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. - Incision and/or trocar insertion&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. - Internal handling during the surgical procedure&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. - Extubation&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. - Other specific pain event related to the surgical procedure (e.g. bone related&#xD;
           treatment in orthopedic, muscle tension or cut etc.).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study population includes subjects requiring a surgical procedure under general&#xD;
      anesthesia. During the surgical procedure the subject is anesthetized (by various anesthetic&#xD;
      agents) and paralyzed (by muscle relaxant agents). Thus, the response to noxious stimuli&#xD;
      under those conditions will be related to the underlying physiological response. The&#xD;
      participants will be monitored, as in a typical surgery and according to the local&#xD;
      guidelines, by various types of monitoring devices, such as: vital signs, pulse oximeter,&#xD;
      Bispectral Index (BIS), Electroencephalography (EEG) etc. Therefore, patients suffering from&#xD;
      fluctuations in their vital signs and hemodynamic parameters during the surgical procedure,&#xD;
      can be detected by the various monitors. However, assessment of the level of nociception is&#xD;
      still complex, subjective and mainly depends on the physician's experience and knowledge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Development of a nociception monitor that may present an index to assess the level of&#xD;
      nociception will allow the anesthesiologist better patient management during the surgical&#xD;
      procedure.&#xD;
