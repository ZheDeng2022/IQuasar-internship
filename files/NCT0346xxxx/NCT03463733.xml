      Background&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently, no standard treatment exists for patients with recurrent glioblastoma multiforme&#xD;
      (rGBM) and used 2nd line treatments have low (up to max. 20%) response rates and very modest&#xD;
      response duration (months). The median overall survival for GBM patients is 12-14 months from&#xD;
      the time of diagnosis; therefore the development of new therapeutic options is imperative. HU&#xD;
      has been used to treat hematological diseases and solid tumors (such as melanoma, ovarian,&#xD;
      squamous cell carcinoma, head and neck carcinoma and brain tumors) in combination with other&#xD;
      anti-cancer agents, but never with TMZ. If found safe, HU+TMZ, is easily translated to the&#xD;
      clinic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Purpose: Phase I trial to identify the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) for the combination of&#xD;
      dose intense temozolomide (TMZ) and hydroxy-urea (HU) in (maximal) thirty patients with&#xD;
      recurrent glioblastoma (rGBM).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Plan of investigation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Month 0-24 (1st and 2nd year): Inclusion and follow-up of a maximum of 30 patients with rGBM&#xD;
&#xD;
      Month 25-31 (3rd year): Follow-up of patients included in the trial, data analysis&#xD;
      (determining MTD and explorative analysis) and manuscript preparation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Possible results:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Obtaining MTD and safety profile of daily HU+TMZ in patients with rGBM;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Preliminary data on the estimation of the median progression-free (PFS) and overall&#xD;
           survival (OS), radiographic response proportion in patients with measurable disease, and&#xD;
           exploratory correlation of treatment outcomes (PFS and OS) with&#xD;
           o6-methylguanine-DNA-methyltransferase (MGMT) promoter methylation status in archival&#xD;
           tumor specimens and further elucidation of underlying mechanism of re-sensitization of&#xD;
           TMZ by HU. Exploratory analysis of biomarkers profile of platelets in patients treated&#xD;
           with HU+TMZ.&#xD;

    <description>Hydroxyurea and temozolomide will be administered every 4 weeks, with 28 consecutive days defined as a treatment cycle. Treatment will be administered on an outpatient basis. Oral hydroxyurea (dose specified by the Dose Cohort below) and oral temozolomide (50 mg/m2/day) will be administered daily in 28-day cycles for 12 cycles or until unacceptable toxicity, intolerance, progressive disease, or withdrawal of consent. Patients will be treated in dose cohorts of 3 with each cohort receiving a specific daily dose assignment of hydroxyurea.&#xD;
All patients in the study will receive temozolomide at 50 mg/m2/day (&quot;dose-intense&quot; schedule). The starting dose level for hydroxyurea will be 200 mg daily (QD) up to a maximum of 2000mg hydroxyurea a day.</description>

      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Participants must have histologically or cytologically confirmed glioblastoma&#xD;
             multiforme&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Patients may have had any number of prior therapies for glioblastoma. Patients must be&#xD;
             at least 28 days from any investigational agent, 28 days from prior cytotoxic therapy&#xD;
             (except 23 days from prior temozolomide, 14 days from vincristine, 42 days from&#xD;
             nitrosoureas, 21 days from procarbazine administration), and 7 days for patients who&#xD;
             received metronomic chemotherapy or non-cytotoxic agents, e.g., interferon, tamoxifen,&#xD;
             thalidomide, cis-retinoic acid, etc.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Age ≥18 years. Because no dosing or adverse event data are currently available on the&#xD;
             use of hydroxyurea in combination with temozolomide in participants &lt;18 years of age,&#xD;
             children are excluded from this study, but will be eligible for future pediatric&#xD;
             trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Karnofsky Performance Status (KPS) ≥60%&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Participants must have normal organ and marrow function as defined below:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  leukocytes ≥3,000/microliter (mcL)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  absolute neutrophil count ≥1,500/mcL&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  platelets ≥100,000/mcL&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  total bilirubin within normal institutional limits&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Aspartate transaminase (AST; SGOT)/alanine transaminase (ALT; SGPT) ≤2.5 ×&#xD;
                  institutional upper limit of normal&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  creatinine below upper limit of normal institutional limits OR&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  creatinine clearance ≥60 mL/min/1.73 m2 for patients with creatinine levels above&#xD;
                  institutional normal.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Progressive disease on contrast-enhanced brain CT or MRI as defined by Response&#xD;
             Assessment in Neuro-Oncology (RANO) Criteria [22], or have documented recurrent&#xD;
             glioblastoma on diagnostic biopsy. Patients who have been previously treated with&#xD;
             bevacizumab therapy that have T2-weighted or FLAIR MRI sequences considered to be&#xD;
             progressive disease by the study investigator but have no contrast-enhancing areas of&#xD;
             recurrent disease are eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Interval of at least 2 weeks from any prior neurosurgical resection (1 week for&#xD;
             intracranial biopsy) to start of study drug; and patient must have adequate wound&#xD;
             healing.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Interval of at least 12 weeks from prior radiotherapy unless there is either: a)&#xD;
             histopathologic confirmation of recurrent tumor, or b) new enhancement on MRI outside&#xD;
             of the radiation treatment (RT) field.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Because cytotoxic agents such as temozolomide and hydroxyurea are known to be&#xD;
             teratogenic, women of child-bearing potential and men must agree to use adequate&#xD;
             contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study&#xD;
             entry and for the duration of study participation. Should a woman become pregnant or&#xD;
             suspect she is pregnant while she or her partner is participating in this study, she&#xD;
             should inform her treating physician immediately. Men treated or enrolled on this&#xD;
             protocol must also agree to use adequate contraception prior to the study, for the&#xD;
             duration of study participation, and 4 months after completion of temozolomide and&#xD;
             hydroxyurea administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Patients must have archival tumor tissue available for molecular analysis and must be&#xD;
             willing to consent for this tissue to be analyzed as part of this study. However, if&#xD;
             no archival tumor tissue is available, the patient will not be excluded from the&#xD;
             study.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Participants who are receiving any other investigational agents or devices in&#xD;
             investigation for glioblastoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Patients must not have been previously treated with an anti-vascular endothelial&#xD;
             growth factor (VEGF) inhibitor.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical composition&#xD;
             to temozolomide and/or hydroxyurea.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active&#xD;
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac&#xD;
             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with&#xD;
             study requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Pregnant women are excluded from this study because hydroxyurea and temozolomide have&#xD;
             known teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Because there is an unknown but potential&#xD;
             risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with&#xD;
             hydroxyurea and temozolomide, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is&#xD;
             treated with hydroxyurea and temozolomide.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. HIV-positive participants on combination antiretroviral therapy are ineligible because&#xD;
             of the potential for pharmacokinetic interactions with hydroxyurea. In addition, these&#xD;
             participants are at increased risk of lethal infections when treated with&#xD;
             marrow-suppressive therapy. Appropriate studies will be undertaken in participants&#xD;
             receiving combination antiretroviral therapy when indicated.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Patients with a history of a different malignancy are ineligible except for the&#xD;
             following circumstances: if they have been disease-free for at least 3 years and are&#xD;
             deemed by the investigator to be at low risk for recurrence of that malignancy;&#xD;
             patients with treated cervical cancer in situ, and basal cell or squamous cell&#xD;
             carcinoma of the skin. Patients will not be eligible if they have evidence of other&#xD;
             malignancy requiring therapy other than surgery within the last 3 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Major surgery (not including minor diagnostic procedures such as lymph node biopsy)&#xD;
             within 2 weeks of start of study drug; or not fully recovered from any side effects of&#xD;
             previous procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Presence of extra-cranial metastatic disease.&#xD;
