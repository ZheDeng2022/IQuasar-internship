    <textblock>
      This is a Phase I single-center, two-arm, open-label, randomized study in healthy&#xD;
      HIV-negative women to evaluate the pharmacokinetics, safety, and bleeding patterns associated&#xD;
      with 90-day use of matrix vaginal rings containing 200 mg Dapivirine and 320 mg&#xD;
      Levonorgestrel.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This 26 week study will be conducted at one site. The site will enroll 24 subjects. Subjects&#xD;
      will be randomized to 1 of 2 treatment regimens:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Regimen A: vaginal ring used continuously for approximately 90 days Regimen B: vaginal ring&#xD;
      used cyclically for approximately 90 days: used for ~28 days, then removed,washed and stored&#xD;
      for 2 days. The same ring will be used for 2 additional cycles in a similar fashion.&#xD;
