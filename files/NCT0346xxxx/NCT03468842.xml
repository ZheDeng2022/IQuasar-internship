    <textblock>
      Exploratory, phase I study to evaluate the clinical efficacy of Streptococcus dentisani CECT&#xD;
      7746 in the risk reduction of caries. Patients who meet the inclusion and exclusion criteria&#xD;
      will be randomized and receive the corresponding treatment. The study will follow a&#xD;
      randomized design, with two groups in parallel (placebo group and probiotic group) of&#xD;
      prospective, double-blind follow-up, for a period of 45 days. The present study will be&#xD;
      conducted in a single center and will include a total of 70 patients. The present study has a&#xD;
      double main objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluate whether the administration of the probiotic S. dentisani CECT 7746 alkalizes&#xD;
           the basal pH of saliva.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Test the safety and tolerability of the probiotic&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluate other microbiological parameters associated with caries risk such as the&#xD;
           presence of microorganisms such as S. mutans.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluate the presence in the mouth and colonization capacity of S. dentisani.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluate the lactic acid and the pH of the ex vivo plate before and after the&#xD;
           administration of a sugar solution&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluate the salivary pH before and after the administration of a sugar solution&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluate the salivary pH before brushing with water.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluate the buffer capacity of saliva&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The probiotic Streptococcus dentisani is a bacterial species present in the human oral&#xD;
      microbial flora. It was isolated initially, as result of observation and hypothesis, of&#xD;
      volunteers who had never developed caries. These strains have demonstrated, through in vitro&#xD;
      studies, an enormous potential of inhibition against S. mutans, besides inhibiting the growth&#xD;
      of other pathogens commonly present in common oral pathologies (gingivitis, periodontitis or&#xD;
      halitosis). The probiotic product has been shown to be effective in in vitro experiments,&#xD;
      artificial mouth models and epidemiological data, statistically significant. However, it is&#xD;
      necessary to document the efficacy of Streptococcus dentisani in an oral application study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment visit:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a first visit, it will be assessed if the candidates meet all the inclusion criteria and&#xD;
      none of the exclusion criteria. For this, a dental revision will be carried out to assess the&#xD;
      different parameters (plaque index, gingival index and salivary flow among others), and a&#xD;
      saliva sample will be taken after brushing with water to determine its basal pH.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Those participants who meet the criteria and provide written informed consent will be&#xD;
      assigned to one of the two treatment groups (probiotic or placebo). The assignment will be&#xD;
      done randomly using a computer generated list.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this first visit, an impression of the jaw will also be made of those volunteers who meet&#xD;
      the criteria and have been randomized. This impression will be used to manufacture custom&#xD;
      splints that allow a more comfortable application of the treatment during the study by the&#xD;
      participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A detailed list of probiotic products present in the market for oral use will be provided.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Basal visit (Day 0):&#xD;
&#xD;
      After 1-2 weeks of the recruitment visit, participants will return to the center for the&#xD;
      baseline visit. During this visit, samples of saliva (2 ml) and plaque (from quadrants 1 and&#xD;
      3 on the vestibular and lingual surfaces) will be taken for the quantification and detection&#xD;
      of S. mutans and Streptococcus dentisani, and plaque samples of quadrants 2 and 4 by the&#xD;
      vestibular and lingual surfaces to quantify the lactic acid produced by the ex vivo plaque,&#xD;
      and its pH. The pH of the saliva will also be evaluated before and after brushing with only&#xD;
      water and then measured before and after a rinse with active movements with 10 ml of a 10%&#xD;
      sugar solution for 1 minute. Finally, the buffering capacity of the saliva, measured by the&#xD;
      amount of acid that the saliva is capable of buffering using reactive strips, will be&#xD;
      evaluated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participants will be treated with probiotic or placebo, depending on the group to which&#xD;
      they have been assigned, without the participant or the researcher knowing the assigned&#xD;
      treatment. For this the two products will present the same appearance. The randomization will&#xD;
      remain blind until the end of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The treatment will consist of the application of the product in the form of gel by all the&#xD;
      free surfaces of the teeth by means of a splint. The production of the splints will be done&#xD;
      by the same recruiting center. These are washable and reusable splints during the entire&#xD;
      study treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first treatment will be carried out during the baseline visit and will be applied by the&#xD;
      clinic professional, who will explain to the participant how to perform successive&#xD;
      applications at home every 48 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will receive the splint and the exact number of doses of probiotic or placebo&#xD;
      needed for the next visit, which they should return in a bag to verify that the treatment has&#xD;
      been followed correctly. Likewise, volunteers will receive a fluoride toothpaste (1000 ppm),&#xD;
      a toothbrush and instructions on how to maintain healthy hygiene habits to standardize study&#xD;
      conditions. The use of mouthwashes and oral probiotic consumption will be expressly&#xD;
      prohibited during the study, all participants will receive a copy of Annexes I and II with&#xD;
      the list of mouthwash and probiotic products not admitted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 1 (Day 15 ± 2 days, follow-up visit):&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this visit participants will be asked to deliver the unused material and they will be&#xD;
      provided with the treatments in the exact dosage number until the next visit, as well as the&#xD;
      elements for oral hygiene. The appearance of any adverse effect during the consumption of the&#xD;
      product will be reviewed with the patient, for it a dental revision will be carried out to&#xD;
      evaluate different parameters (plaque index, gingival index and salivary flow among others).&#xD;
      During this visit, samples of saliva (2 ml) and plaque (from quadrants 1 and 3 on the&#xD;
      vestibular and lingual surfaces) will be taken for the quantification and detection of S.&#xD;
      mutans and Streptococcus dentisani, and plaque samples of quadrants 2 and 4 by the vestibular&#xD;
      and lingual surfaces to quantify the lactic acid produced by the ex vivo plaque, and its pH.&#xD;
      The pH of the saliva will also be evaluated before and after brushing with only water and&#xD;
      then measured before and after a rinse with active movements with 10 ml of a 10% sugar&#xD;
      solution for 1 minute. Finally, the buffer capacity of saliva will be evaluated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During this visit, the clinic professional will once again apply the product to all&#xD;
      participants and remind them how successive applications should be made at their home every&#xD;
      48 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 2 (Day 30 ± 2 days, end of treatment):&#xD;
&#xD;
      The same procedure will be followed as in visit 1 (day 15), but new single doses will not be&#xD;
      provided.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 3 (Day 45 ± 2 days, final visit):&#xD;
&#xD;
      During this visit, samples of saliva (2 ml) and plaque (from quadrants 1 and 3 on the&#xD;
      vestibular and lingual surfaces) will be taken for the quantification and detection of S.&#xD;
      mutans and Streptococcus dentisani, and plaque samples of quadrants 2 and 4 by the vestibular&#xD;
      and lingual surfaces to quantify the lactic acid produced by the ex vivo plaque, and its pH.&#xD;
      The pH of the saliva will also be evaluated before and after brushing with only water and&#xD;
      then measured before and after a rinse with active movements with 10 ml of a 10% sugar&#xD;
      solution for 1 minute. Finally, the buffer capacity of saliva will be evaluated.&#xD;
