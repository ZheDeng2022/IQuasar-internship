      When doctors and nurses use accepted guidelines for quickly treating patients who come to the&#xD;
      emergency department (ED) with a possible heart attack, patients do better. Research shows&#xD;
      that there are racial-identity- and ethnicity-based differences in the symptoms these&#xD;
      patients have, when and why they seek care, the treatments they receive, and how well they&#xD;
      fare afterwards. There is also Canadian evidence that there may be racial-identity-based&#xD;
      disparities in the care some patients receive, and it has been suggested that health&#xD;
      professionals may unconsciously treat patients of different racial identities differently.&#xD;
      But it is not known if there is racial-identity variation in the care given to Canadian&#xD;
      patients with heart attack symptoms in the critical first hours after coming to an ED, or in&#xD;
      their experiences of this care. The investigators collected information from the health&#xD;
      records of patients who come to EDs with symptoms of heart attack. The investigators recorded&#xD;
      events and times such as what provisional diagnosis was assigned to the patient, how often&#xD;
      they received pain medication, how long until certain tests were performed and what&#xD;
      treatments were offered. The investigators also collected information about things that might&#xD;
      affect delivery of care, e.g., the number of doctors and nurses who were on duty.&#xD;
      Participants also completed a short questionnaire about their reasons for coming to the&#xD;
      hospital, how long they waited before coming and why, and what their experience in the ED was&#xD;
      like. The investigators reviewed this information to see if there are racial-identity-based&#xD;
      differences in the care received by patients with heart attack symptoms. The findings could&#xD;
      identify important disparities, which could in turn inform future projects to correct these&#xD;
      disparities, for example, education of health professionals about ethnic differences in ideas&#xD;
      of health and illness.&#xD;

      The investigators conducted a prospective, observational study in which patients presenting&#xD;
      to EDs who were subsequently diagnosed with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) or possible ACS&#xD;
      were identified. The investigators collected data related to receiving the accepted standard&#xD;
      of care for ACS patients. Information about the participants' initial symptoms, attribution&#xD;
      of their symptoms, treatment-seeking choices, and perceptions of the care received in the ED&#xD;
      was collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Setting and Sample: The investigators conducted the study at three sites: Hospital 1 is in an&#xD;
      inner-city, quaternary care, university-affiliated hospital whose ED has approximately 71,000&#xD;
      patient visits annually, about 2,800 of which are patients with symptoms that are potentially&#xD;
      due to myocardial ischemia. The medical and nursing staffing levels are staggered based on&#xD;
      expected patient volumes, ranging from 15 to 18 registered nurses (RNs) and 1 to 6 physicians&#xD;
      at a given time. There are also support staff, including licensed practical nurses, aides;&#xD;
      clerks, ECG technicians, etc. There is a designated triage area, staffed continuously by at&#xD;
      least one RN. Hospital 2's ED is in a large community hospital in a different health&#xD;
      authority. It has 100,000 patient visits annually, approximately 6,500 of which are patients&#xD;
      with potentially ischemic symptoms. The medical and nursing staffing levels are similar to&#xD;
      the first site, ranging from 19 to 22 registered nurses (RNs) and 1 to 4 physicians at a&#xD;
      given time. This site is in a community with a very high proportion of South Asian people&#xD;
      (27.5%). Hospital 3 is also a community hospital with fewer ED visits annually, but similar&#xD;
      nursing and medical staffing levels. This site is in a community with a very high proportion&#xD;
      (52.5%) of people identifying as being of Chinese ancestry.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedures: Research assistants (RAs) fluent in English, Mandarin and Cantonese for the&#xD;
      tertiary site and one fluent in English and Punjabi for the community site recruited&#xD;
      participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment. The RAs identified potential participants, seven days per week, from one of&#xD;
      three sources: (1) a list, obtained daily from the ED charge nurse, of all patients admitted&#xD;
      to the hospital since the RA's last visit who were triaged with codes related to a possible&#xD;
      ACS; (2) the current charge nurse, who identified any patient currently in the ED who met&#xD;
      study criteria as signified by the ED physician ordering one of the following: (i) cardiology&#xD;
      consult, (ii) cardiac computational tomography, or (iii) 2- or 6-hour repeat cardiac&#xD;
      biomarker and ECG, followed by outpatient provocative stress testing; (3) a list, obtained&#xD;
      from the stress-testing laboratory, of all patients who had been referred from the ED for&#xD;
      urgent (within 48 hours) outpatient stress testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment occurred in the ED, the cardiology units (CCU or telemetry unit) and in the&#xD;
      stress-testing laboratory. Potential participants were screened for general eligibility&#xD;
      through discussion with the nurse or cardiology technologist. Those believed to be eligible&#xD;
      were approached and invited to participate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection. Data regarding delivery of guideline-based care in the ED were collected&#xD;
      from the health record (e.g., time to stretcher, time to ECG, time to first MD assessment,&#xD;
      medications administered) and other processes (e.g., occurrence and timing of cardiology&#xD;
      consultation, transfer from ED to a critical care area). Data regarding several patient-,&#xD;
      environment- and system-related potential covariates were collected from the health record&#xD;
      (e.g., mode of arrival at ED; language spoken; accompanied by family/friend; language ability&#xD;
      of family/friend; symptoms reported) and ED staffing records (staffing levels). Data&#xD;
      pertaining to the entire ED stay were captured.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants were asked to respond to a questionnaire, administered by the RA, regarding&#xD;
      their decision to seek treatment and their perspectives on their ED care. Ethnicity, racial&#xD;
      identity and other sociodemographic data were obtained during the interview.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For those admitted to the hospital, additional data regarding admission unit , procedures&#xD;
      offered, refused and undergone, major adverse cardiac events, length of stay and final&#xD;
      diagnosis were collected. For participants who were discharged from the ED with referral to&#xD;
      outpatient stress testing, we tracked discharge diagnosis, attendance at, and interpretation&#xD;
      of the test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measures: The primary outcome variable, door-to-ECG time, was defined as the time from triage&#xD;
      to first ECG acquisition. The official triage time is the time entered by the triage nurse&#xD;
      when the patient is initially evaluated. The time of the first ECG is an electronic time&#xD;
      stamp appearing in the clinical information system, entered when the ECG is acquired.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The predictor variables ethnicity and racial identity were measured by self-report.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Other outcome variables and potential confounders:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Time intervals: Several time intervals were measured, based on the official triage time.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Location, nature and severity of reported symptoms: All symptoms reported by&#xD;
           participant, as well as their intensity.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Acuity at time of triage: measured using the Canadian Triage and Acuity Score. The&#xD;
           participants' presenting complaint was measured using the Canadian Emergency Department&#xD;
           Information System standardised codes, in use at the study sites.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Other data: Mode of transport to hospital, accompanied versus alone, noted difficulty&#xD;
           with English, presence of interpreter during care&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Number and frequency of physician and nurse assessments/interventions.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Measured clinical parameters: All documented observations of ECG rhythm and vital signs.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Medications: Agent, dose, route and time of administration&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. Diagnostic testing: Timing and frequency of bloodwork and ECGs.&#xD;
&#xD;
        9. Consultation: Consultation of other medical services.&#xD;
&#xD;
       10. Patient Disposition.&#xD;
&#xD;
       11. Patient perspectives: Time of onset, type of symptoms, decisions to seek treatment and&#xD;
           reasons for delaying; participants' perspectives on care in ED; other socio-demographic&#xD;
           variables&#xD;
&#xD;
       12. Emergency department contextual factors: Staffing levels for each shift.&#xD;
&#xD;
       13. Post-ED care: Diagnostic tests and interventions offered and completed after leaving ED,&#xD;
           e.g., referral for / offer of / consent to / receipt of angiogram, percutaneous coronary&#xD;
           intervention or cardiac surgery; discharge diagnosis; length of hospital stay.&#xD;
