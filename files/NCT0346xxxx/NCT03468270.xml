      The aim of the study is to describe pain coping strategies and their evolution in children&#xD;
      and adolescent with cerebral palsy.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Towards the end of the 20th century, Lazarus and Folkmann developed the concept that the&#xD;
      individual provides &quot;cognitive and behavioral efforts to control, reduce or tolerate the&#xD;
      internal or external demands that threaten or exceed his or her resources&quot;. These cognitive&#xD;
      and behavioral efforts are grouped under the term &quot;coping&quot;, which describes a process rather&#xD;
      than personality traits or abilities. Coping is not about controlling stress but about&#xD;
      diminishing, avoiding, tolerating or accepting it.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The pain, &quot;unpleasant sensory and emotional experience related to a bodily injury&quot;, aims to&#xD;
      warn the individual that the integrity of his body is threatened, and is thus a real&#xD;
      &quot;stressor&quot;. It will lead to the choice of coping strategies, which depends in part on the&#xD;
      characteristics of the individual (his beliefs, stress endurance, anxiety propensity) and&#xD;
      environmental variables (characteristics of the painful situation, social support and&#xD;
      emotional connections, information about the threatening situation). Many studies have shown&#xD;
      that the strategies used to cope with chronic pain in adults and children play a major role&#xD;
      in the adjustment of patients to their pathology, in terms of emotional distress, disability,&#xD;
      and quality of life. The different types of strategies have been widely studied in the&#xD;
      literature in so-called &quot;typical&quot; children. Active strategies classically found in pediatrics&#xD;
      are distraction, cognitive self-instruction, and problem solving. These active strategies are&#xD;
      said to be positive because they have been proven to help children manage pain more&#xD;
      effectively than passive strategies such as catastrophism, helplessness, or seeking social&#xD;
      support, which are dysfunctional because they are not focused on the problem and increase the&#xD;
      negative consequences associated with pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is about children with cerebral palsy (CP) because the great variability and&#xD;
      complexity of the manifestations of the pathology and the therapeutic treatment make it that&#xD;
      there is a big risk for the child to experience pain, with a prevalence of pain ranging from&#xD;
      60% to 73%, depending on the evaluation methods. Research has done a great deal in recent&#xD;
      years to improve the assessment and management of inborn or induced pain in children with&#xD;
      disabilities, with many validated recommendations, even though this still appears to be a&#xD;
      neglected comorbidity in PC. However, coping strategies of PC children with pain have never&#xD;
      been studied. The purpose of this work is to describe these strategies in PC children and&#xD;
      adolescents, as well as their evolution.&#xD;

        The patients were recruited in the services of 2 French Red Cross Physical Medicine and&#xD;
        Rehabilitation Centers in France. All parents and children were informed orally about the&#xD;
        procedure, and parental consent as the child's consent was obtained in writing.&#xD;
