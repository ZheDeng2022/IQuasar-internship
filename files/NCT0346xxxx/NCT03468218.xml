  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well pembrolizumab and cabozantinib in treating patients with&#xD;
      head and neck squamous cell cancer that has come back or spread to other places in the body&#xD;
      and cannot be removed by surgery. Monoclonal antibodies, such as pembrolizumab, may interfere&#xD;
      with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Cabozantinib may stop the growth of tumor&#xD;
      cells by blocking some of the pathways needed for cell growth. Giving pembrolizumab and&#xD;
      cabozantinib may improve the chances of tumor response in patients with head and neck&#xD;
      squamous cell cancer.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To estimate the overall response rate (ORR) of patients with recurrent/metastatic (RM)&#xD;
      squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN) who receive the combination of&#xD;
      pembrolizumab and cabozantinib.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To estimate the progression-free survival (PFS) of patients treated with the combination&#xD;
           of pembrolizumab and cabozantinib.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To further define the toxicities associated with these regimens in patients with SCCHN.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive pembrolizumab intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on day 1 and cabozantinib&#xD;
      orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-21. Cycles repeat every 3 weeks in the absence of&#xD;
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up to 2 years.&#xD;
