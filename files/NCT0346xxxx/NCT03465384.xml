    <textblock>
      The Comet-program is a Swedish parent training program developed to target externalizing&#xD;
      behaviors in children between 3-11 years. The program is normally delivered in group format&#xD;
      in primary and specialized care and has already been evaluated in several studies. The&#xD;
      internet-based version of the program has also been evaluated separately, but in this study&#xD;
      the two formats will be directly compared in a randomized non-inferiority study. Parent&#xD;
      ratings, child ratings as well as blinded clinical assessments will be conducted before the&#xD;
      interventions, after the interventions (2-3 month after start of intervention), and at&#xD;
      follow-up (12 mont after first assessment). The primary research question is: Will the&#xD;
      internet-based format of Comet be at least as effective as the group format in reducing&#xD;
      externalizing behaviors? Secondary research questions concern possible differential effects&#xD;
      of the two formats on cost-effectiveness, parenting behaviors, parent mental health,&#xD;
      applicability and consumer satisfaction, and the children's quality of life.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Comet-program is a Swedish parent training program developed to target externalizing&#xD;
      behaviors in children between 3-11 years. The program content is behaviorally oriented and&#xD;
      the emphasis lies on increasing parenting behaviors that reinforces pro-social behaviors in&#xD;
      children, as well as limiting the reinforcement of anti-social behaviors. The program is&#xD;
      manualized and normally delivered in group format with parents to 6-8 children in each group.&#xD;
      The group sessions (11 sessions á 2.5 hours) are led by two practitioners and include&#xD;
      information, role-playing, and home-work exercises. The group format has been evaluated in&#xD;
      two large randomized controlled studies. The effect sizes on child externalizing behaviors&#xD;
      have been medium to large (Cohen´s d). Because of the evidence supporting Comet and other&#xD;
      research supporting the effectiveness of similar behavioral parenting programs, Comet has&#xD;
      been implemented in primary and specialized care in Sweden. A challenge in primary care is&#xD;
      however the implementation costs related to the program (e.g., training of group leaders and&#xD;
      the time each group leader need to invest in each patient). Therefore, Comet (or similar&#xD;
      programs) are in practice used to a small extent in primary care, despite clear&#xD;
      recommendations to offer such treatments for externalizing behaviors. A possible solution&#xD;
      would be to offer an internet-based version of the program, which in two large randomized&#xD;
      controlled trials have shown medium effect sizes on externalizing behaviors in children. In&#xD;
      the internet-based version, the patients (parents) work online with seven modules over a&#xD;
      period of nine weeks. Every module contains information, video-clips, quizzes and homework&#xD;
      exercises. Every week the patient communicates with a therapist, that gives brief guidance&#xD;
      and feedback online.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The internet-based format of the program has however been implemented at a very small scale&#xD;
      in regular care. One reason is probably reluctance on part of practitioners as well as&#xD;
      patients in replacing face-to-face contact with online-contact. The management system used in&#xD;
      health-care in Sweden is another obstacle, since only face-to-face contacts are included.&#xD;
      Hence, the clinics are not financially compensated for any patient contacts online. To&#xD;
      overcome these obstacles, the present study will compare the regular Comet program in group&#xD;
      format to a modified version of the internet-based version. In the modified version, the&#xD;
      online contact between the patient and the therapist will be replaced with three individual&#xD;
      face-to-face sessions (45 min each). This will reduce the total amount of time invested per&#xD;
      patient to 135 mins, compared to 410-550 mins per patient in the group format.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research questions:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary research question in the study is: (1) Will the internet-based version of Comet&#xD;
      be at least as effective as the group format in reducing externalizing behaviors in children?&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary research questions will be to investigate if the two formats of Comet will&#xD;
      differ in terms of: (2) cost effectiveness, (3) consumer satisfaction/applicability for&#xD;
      patients as well as practitioners, (4) effects on parent behaviors and mental health, (5)&#xD;
      effects on the quality of the relationship between parents and children, (6) effects on the&#xD;
      quality of life experienced by the children, and (7) if the application of parenting&#xD;
      strategies included in Comet mediates change in child externalizing behaviors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Method:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To investigate these research questions, parents seeking help in primary care clinics for&#xD;
      externalizing behaviors in their child will be recruited to the study. Six clinics will be&#xD;
      involved in recruitment of participants and offering the interventions. Clinical&#xD;
      psychologists on every clinic will therefore be trained in both formats of the Comet program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Enrolled participants will be randomized at each clinic to either take part in the group&#xD;
      format or the internet-based format of Comet. The participants randomized to the latter&#xD;
      format will start their treatment as soon as they have completed the first assessment, while&#xD;
      participants in the group format will have to wait for the scheduled group to start&#xD;
      (generally within 1-3 months after enrollment and first assessment). The post assessment will&#xD;
      take place when participants have completed the intervention and the follow-up assessment&#xD;
      will be 12 months after the first assessment point. In addition, parents in each condition&#xD;
      will answer a few questions on a weekly basis during their interventions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessments at pre, post and follow-up will include parent ratings of child behaviors, parent&#xD;
      behaviors, parent mental health, and consumer satisfaction/applicability (only at post&#xD;
      assessment). At pre and post assessment blinded clinicians will also make a diagnostic&#xD;
      assessment of Oppositional Defiant Disorder (ODD) and Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity&#xD;
      Disorder (ADHD) symptoms of the participating children. When the clinician meets the child&#xD;
      for these assessments, the child will also be answering questions (structured interview)&#xD;
      regarding their experienced quality of life. Finally, the psychologist involved in the&#xD;
      treatments will continuously take notes in a log-book for each participant. The log-book will&#xD;
      contain information on parent attendance, adherence and adverse events. A selection of the&#xD;
      treating psychologists will also be interviewed to assess their experienced applicability of&#xD;
      the two formats of Comet.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The weekly questions will measure child externalizing behavior and the extent to which the&#xD;
      parents have completed homework exercises (parenting strategies).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since the primary research question is if the internet-based version of Comet is at least as&#xD;
      effective as the group format, the power calculation was based on non-inferiority design. The&#xD;
      first step is to decide the non-inferiority margin, which is the least acceptable difference&#xD;
      between the conditions in order to conclude that the internet-based version is non-inferior.&#xD;
      A conventional method for deciding this margin is to use 50% of the effect sizes found in&#xD;
      previous studies of the already established intervention. When applying this method for the&#xD;
      primary outcome measure, the calculation showed that 134 participants were necessary to&#xD;
      include in order to achieve a power of 0.80. In other words, if there is truly no difference&#xD;
      between the group format and the internet-based format, then 134 patients are required to be&#xD;
      80% sure that the lower limit of a one-sided 95% confidence interval (or equivalently a 90%&#xD;
      two-sided confidence interval) will be above the non-inferiority limit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Most research question will be analyzed using methods from non-inferiority design, i.e.,&#xD;
      analyzing the difference between adjusted means at post and follow-up with regard to the&#xD;
      non-inferiority margin. Primarily, these analyses will be performed on participants who&#xD;
      completed the interventions and assessments (per protocol), since intention-to-treat analyses&#xD;
      reduces power and increase the risk falsely concluding non-inferiority.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the second research question (cost-effectiveness), the clinical significance in each&#xD;
      condition will be calculated and compared (i.e., the proportion of participants that have&#xD;
      &quot;recovered&quot;, &quot;improved&quot;, are &quot;unchanged&quot; or have &quot;deteriorated). Thereafter, the cost per&#xD;
      patient for each treatment will be calculated and used to achieve an estimate of cost per&#xD;
      recovered/improved participant. This method has previously been applied in a&#xD;
      cost-effectiveness analysis of Comet and other parenting programs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The analyses of practitioner satisfaction and experienced applicability will mainly be&#xD;
      descriptive, due to lack of power (to few practitioners involved in treatment) and due to&#xD;
      fact that part of the data is qualitative (interviews).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Finally, the analyses of mediation (research question 7), will be analyzed using Latent&#xD;
      Growth Curve Modeling, which is suitable for data that is measured repeatedly during an&#xD;
      intervention.&#xD;
