  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a cross-section correlational study that will examine the relationships between&#xD;
      wheelchair speed, maneuverability, and endurance with community integration. By identifying&#xD;
      which of these has the biggest contribution to community participation, the information will&#xD;
      be used to justify continues therapy, to alter the focus of therapy, and to justify purchase&#xD;
      of power or power assist wheelchairs when needed. Currently, therapists make the&#xD;
      recommendation for a power or power assist chair based on their clinical judgement and the&#xD;
      patient's experience, but there has been limited justification from the literature for these&#xD;
      decisions. Finally, because the CHART measure is the gold standard in rehabilitation research&#xD;
      for community integration, but has psychometric problems, we will use this opportunity to&#xD;
      validate a new more psychometrically solid measure, the PART-O, against the CHART.&#xD;

    <measure>Life Space Assessment Scale Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 0</time_frame>
    <description>This nine question survey asks participants where they have gone in the last week, frequency of those visits, and how independently they went there. The locations vary from spaces within their home, immediately around their home, or outside of their neighborhood, city, county, state or nation. Their independent movement patterns will be classified as within the home, limited community mobility and full community mobility.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Distance (meters) covered in six-minute push test</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 0</time_frame>
    <description>This is a measure of endurance, and requires that the participant wheel themselves around two pylons that are located 15 meters apart for 6 minutes</description>
  </secondary_outcome>

    <measure>Average time to complete forward push test</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 0</time_frame>
    <description>This measure of wheelchair propulsion speed asks patients to propel themselves as fast as they can over 20 meters. This task is performed twice, and the average time is used for the score</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Time to complete Manual Wheelchair slalom Test</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 0</time_frame>
    <description>In this measure, participants propel themselves through an 18 meter slalom course at their maximum self-selected speed, wheeling around seven cones, separated by three, two, or one meter</description>

    <description>This group will participate in activity-based measures employed in routine occupational and physical therapy practice to assess participants' wheelchair speed, maneuverability, and endurance. These measures include: the Life Space Assessment Scale, 6-Minute Push Test, Forward Push Test, Wheelchair Slalom Test, Craig Handicap Assessment and Reporting Technique, and PART-O.</description>

  <arm_group>
    <arm_group_label>GPS Tracking</arm_group_label>
    <description>A GPS tracker will be placed on the wheelchairs of 25 individuals who consent to participate in this arm of the project. Using a GPS tracker will provide a direct measure of the community locations these participants go. The GPS location is collected every minute, and mapped to Google Maps, which would allow calculation of speed of movement.</description>
