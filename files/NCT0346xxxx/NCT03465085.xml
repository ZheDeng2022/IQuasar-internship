  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: Intra-alveolar clotting and alveolar collapse in ARDS is due to alveolar&#xD;
      capillaries epithelial and leakage. Subsequently, collapse induces hypoxemia that is&#xD;
      resistant to recruitment (RM). Heparin and Streptokinase may prevent or dissolve&#xD;
      intra-alveolar fibrin clot respectively helping alveolar re-expansion. We examined and&#xD;
      compared the effect of nebulizing Heparin versus Streptokinase on reversing this pathology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: Sixty severe ARDS (PaO2/FiO2&lt;100) patients and failure of RM, prone position (PP)&#xD;
      and neuromuscular block (NMB) were partially randomised into Group (I): (n=20) received&#xD;
      nebulized Heparin 10000 IU/4h. Group (II): (n=20) received nebulized Streptokinase 250,000&#xD;
      IU/4h. Group (III): (n=20) received conservative management. Randomization to either Heparin&#xD;
      or Streptokinase groups was applied to patients whom guardian accepted participation, while&#xD;
      those who declined participation were followed-up as a control. The primary outcome was the&#xD;
      change in PaO2/FiO2; the secondary outcomes included the change in compliance, plateau&#xD;
      pressure, ventilation-off days, coagulation and ICU mortality.&#xD;

      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The current study was carried out in the Intensive Care Unit of a tertiary University&#xD;
      Hospital following approval by the local Research and Ethics Committee and after obtaining of&#xD;
      a written informed consent from the first of kin of the recruited patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The guardians of the patients with severe ARDS fulfilling the inclusion criteria of our study&#xD;
      were offered to participate in the trial. Randomization to either Heparin or Streptokinase&#xD;
      groups was applied to patients whom first of kin agreed to participate in the trial, while&#xD;
      patients whom first of kin declined to participate were followed up as a control group.&#xD;
      Written informed consent to participate in the trial and to undergo randomization to either&#xD;
      Heparin or Streptokinase group was signed by the guardians who approved their patients to&#xD;
      participate. Written informed consent to use patients data was signed by the guardians who&#xD;
      declined their patients to participate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adult patients aged 21-60 years and admitted to our ICU with the diagnosis of ARDS according&#xD;
      to Berlin definition (12) were examined and followed up for the presence of the following&#xD;
      inclusion criteria;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Severe ARDS with PO2/FiO2 ratio&lt;100.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Failure of Recruitment Maneuver (RM), (13) Prone Position (PP) (14) or Neuro-Muscular&#xD;
           Block (NMB) (15) to improve hypoxemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  No contraindications to thrombolytic or anticoagulant therapy (e.g. Coagulopathy,&#xD;
           Heparin-Induced Thrombocytopenia, Previous administration of streptokinase, Known or&#xD;
           suspected allergy to heparin or streptokinase, History of intracranial hemorrhage in the&#xD;
           past 12 months, Patients with an epidural catheter in place or likely to be placed&#xD;
           within the next 48 h.).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Only patients who have all the three criteria were included in the trial following consenting&#xD;
      the first of kin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sixty severe ARDS patients with failure of RM, PP and NMB and the absence of a&#xD;
      contraindication to thrombolytic or anticoagulant therapy were recruited.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Forty patients whom guardian agreed to participate actively in the study were randomly&#xD;
      assigned to one of the two groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group (I): 20 patients received inhaled Unfractionated Heparin at a dose of 10000 IU/4h by&#xD;
      nebulizer, with the total daily dose of nebulized Unfractionated Heparin 60,000 IU&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group (II): 20 patients received inhaled Streptokinase at a dose of 250,000 IU/4h by&#xD;
      nebulizer, with the total daily dose of nebulized Streptokinase 1,500,000 IU.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A random set of numbers were generated by the computer (www.randomizer.org), and each number&#xD;
      was sealed in an opaque envelope, and the envelopes were kept in the ICU. One envelope was&#xD;
      randomly selected after a patient was selected for recruitment and his/her first of kin&#xD;
      consented. The key for assigning numbers to either group was stored on encrypted USB device&#xD;
      with one of the investigators. One of the investigators was responsible for preparing the&#xD;
      medication nebulizer while the nurse and the ICU physician attending the case and recording&#xD;
      the data were blinded to the patients group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Twenty patients whom guardian declined to participate actively in the study but accepted to&#xD;
      participate passively by consenting for using their data, were assigned as Group III, or the&#xD;
      control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients received the routine intensive care protocol for cases of ARDS including the&#xD;
      specific ventilatory protocol (16) with monitoring and recording of the following parameters:&#xD;
      PaO2 [arterial partial pressure of oxygen], FiO2 [Fraction of inspired oxygen], PaO2/FiO2&#xD;
      ratio, Lung compliance [ml/cmH2o], Peak airway pressure [cmH2o], Coagulation profile&#xD;
      [platelets count, prothrombin concentration, INR (International Normalized Ratio), bleeding&#xD;
      time] and any side effects or complications as bleeding, coagulopathy, HIT (Heparin Induced&#xD;
      Thrombocytopenia) and allergic reactions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Start and termination of therapy:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Heparin nebulizer or Streptokinase nebulizer (according to the study group) will continue&#xD;
      till the occurrence of one or more of the following: (1) Improvement of the hypoxemia as&#xD;
      determined by PaO2/FiO2 ratio &gt;300. (2) Improvement of the pulmonary compliance of the&#xD;
      patient measured by ventilator defined as dynamic compliance &gt; 50 ml/cmH2O. (3) The&#xD;
      occurrence of complications as bleeding or coagulopathy. (4) Failure of the therapy to&#xD;
      produce improvement in hypoxemia or compliance after 72 hours of initiation of therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Considering that in case of improvement in either parameter; oxygenation or pulmonary&#xD;
      compliance will mandate continuation of therapy for a maximum of 4 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nebulization&#xD;
&#xD;
      Heparin or Streptokinase were nebulized by Aeroneb Pro@ Lab mesh nebulizer (Aerogen Limited,&#xD;
      Galway, Ireland) which is incorporated within GE Healthcare's Engström Carestation ventilator&#xD;
      (General Electric Company, Finland). Aeroneb nebulizer is a palladium vibrating mesh&#xD;
      nebulizer. The central aperture plate of the nebulizer is 5mm in diameter and is perforated&#xD;
      with 1000 precision formed holes, that vibrate at 128,000 times per second, to produce the&#xD;
      particles with size 1-5 micron in diameter with average MMAD (Mean Mass Aerodynamic Diameter)&#xD;
      is 2.1 microns. The nebulized medication (either streptokinase 250,000 IU or heparin 10.000&#xD;
      IU) was prepared in 3 ml volume of distilled water and nebulized for a period of 15 minutes&#xD;
      every 4 hours. As per the manufacturer, 0.3 ml of residual volume remains in the nebulizer&#xD;
      after each nebulization. Nebulized medications were delivered to the circuit at the junction&#xD;
      between the Y-piece and the ETT (Figure 1) to allow the minimal distance between the&#xD;
      nebulization delivery port and the ETT. A filter in the expiratory limb (between the&#xD;
      ventilator end of the breathing circuit and the ventilator machine) prevented contamination&#xD;
      of the circuit. Humidification was supplied by Fisher&amp; Paykel MR 370 humidifier, with the&#xD;
      humidifier was stopped and disconnected from the breathing circuit 10 minutes before&#xD;
      nebulization and restored 10 minutes after the end of nebulization. During the nebulization,&#xD;
      to ensure adequate drug delivery, the ventilatory settings were changed to volume controlled&#xD;
      ventilation with TV 500 ml, RR 14/min., I: E ratio of 1:1.5, inspiratory pause 75% of the&#xD;
      inspiratory time, PEEP 10 cmH2O with FIO2 of 1. In case of high peak airway pressure ≥40&#xD;
      cmH2O, the tidal volume was decreased gradually to keep peak airway pressure &lt;40 cmH2O. The&#xD;
      initial ventilatory settings were restored 10 minutes after the end of nebulization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The day of start of nebulization is considered day 0 and readings for day 1 was recorded 24&#xD;
      hours after the start of nebulizers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ventilation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A pressure-regulated volume-controlled mode (auto flow) of mechanical ventilation was used.&#xD;
      The target tidal volume was set at a range from 4 to 8 ml /kg we started by 6 ml/kg then&#xD;
      increased or decreased according to Plateau pressure and CO2 level. Plateau pressure limit up&#xD;
      to 30 CmH2o, and CO2 was maintained within normal limit (35 - 45 mmHg), PEEP was maintained&#xD;
      10 mmHg; the Respiratory rate was adjusted according to CO2 level and I: E ratio was&#xD;
      maintained at 1: 2. this was routine practice at the time of the study. The trial of weaning&#xD;
      used a spontaneous pressure support mode. The level of pressure support was adjusted to&#xD;
      maintain the target tidal volume. Extubation was considered if patients meet the criteria of&#xD;
      weaning such as being hemodynamically stable and cooperative in addition to minimal&#xD;
      ventilator parameter (SpO2&gt; 95% on a pressure support mode &lt; 10 cm H2O, PEEP &lt; 5 cm H2O and&#xD;
      FiO2 &lt; 50%).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcomes&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome was the mean daily ratio of PaO2 to FiO2 (PaO2/FiO2). The Secondary&#xD;
      outcomes included; static lung compliance, plateau pressure, change in PaCO2, ventilator-off&#xD;
      days in surviving patients at ICU discharge, ICU mortality at discharge from ICU and&#xD;
      coagulation profile and occurrence of any bleeding complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size estimation and Statistical analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size calculated after obtaining preliminary data from 5 patients in control group that&#xD;
      revealed mean (SD) of PaO2/FiO2 ratio at day 8 was 82(13). Assuming 30% difference between&#xD;
      groups and by using G power software (version 3.1.3, Düsseldorf, Germany) with power 95% and&#xD;
      alpha error and with doubling SD, total sample size was 57 patients rolled up to 60 for&#xD;
      possible dropout.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The data were examined for normality of distribution by Kolmogorov-Smirnov test (P &lt;0.05).&#xD;
      Continuous variables with normal distribution were expressed as mean ± SD (range) and were&#xD;
      compared for significant differences between groups by using independent t-test. Paired&#xD;
      t-test was used for intragroup comparisons between day-1 and day-8 for each group. Comparison&#xD;
      of the means of normally distributed data was done using Two-way analysis (Two Factors (Group&#xD;
      and Time)) of variance (between within mixed design) to test Group, Time and Group*Time&#xD;
      interaction. The categorical variables were presented in numbers and were compared for&#xD;
      significance by using chi squared (χ2) test or Fisher's exact test when appropriate. For all&#xD;
      comparisons, a P value &lt; 0.05 will be considered significant. IBM SPSS Advanced Statistics&#xD;
      Version 22.0 was used for Data Analysis (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL).&#xD;
