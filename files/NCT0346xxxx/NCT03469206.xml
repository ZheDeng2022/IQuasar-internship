      Background: Intravenous thrombolysis (IVT) combined with mechanical thrombectomy (MT) has&#xD;
      been proven safe and effective in patients with acute ischemic stroke (AIS) of anterior&#xD;
      circulation large vessel occlusion (LVO). Despite recanalization, a considerable proportion&#xD;
      of patients do not recover. The incidence of symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage (sICH) was&#xD;
      similar between combined IVT plus MT and IVT, suggesting that this complication could not be&#xD;
      attributed to the MT, but rather to pre-treatment with IVT. Meanwhile, the incidence of&#xD;
      intracranial atherosclerosis stenosis (ICAS) is higher in Asians. It is not clear whether&#xD;
      patients with ICAS benefit from pretreatment with alteplase or not and how ICAS modifies&#xD;
      treatment effect.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: To assess whether direct MT is non-inferior compared to combined IVT plus MT in&#xD;
      patients with AIS due to an anterior circulation LVO, and to assess treatment effect&#xD;
      modification by presence of ICAD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design: This is a parallel group, RCT of direct MT compared to combined IVT plus MT,&#xD;
      using a non-inferiority design. The trial has observer blinded assessment of the primary&#xD;
      outcome and of neuro-imaging at baseline and follow up. The trial will be executed in&#xD;
      collaboration with MRCLEAN NO-IV investigators.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population: Patients with AIS of anterior circulation VLO confirmed by CTA. Initiation&#xD;
      of IVT must be feasible within 4.5 hours from symptom onset. Age must be 18 or over and NIHSS&#xD;
      2 or more.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main outcomes: The full distribution of the mRS at 3 months. Secondary outcomes: 1. death&#xD;
      within 90 +/- 14 days; 2. pre-interventional reperfusion assessed on first intracranial DSA;&#xD;
      3. eTICI19 score on final angiography of MT; 4. score on the NIHSS at 24 +/- 6 hours and 5-7&#xD;
      days, or at discharge; 5. recanalization rate at 24-72h by CTA; 6. Final lesion volume at 5-7&#xD;
      days on NCCT20; 7. score on the EuroQoL 5-dimensions 5-level (EQ5D-5L)21 and Barthel index22&#xD;
      at 90 +/- 14 days; 8. dichotomous clinical outcome on the mRS at 90 +/- 14 days.&#xD;

      Protocol title: Direct Intra-arterial thrombectomy in order to Revascularize AIS patients&#xD;
      with large vessel occlusion Efficiently in Chinese Tertiary hospitals: a Multicenter&#xD;
      randomized clinical Trial (DIRECT-MT) Rationale: Mechanical thrombectomy (MT) by means of&#xD;
      retrievable stents has been proven safe and effective in patients with acute ischemic stroke&#xD;
      (AIS) with confirmed large vessel occlusion of the anterior circulation and in whom the&#xD;
      procedure can be started within 6 hours from onset. Despite recanalization, a considerable&#xD;
      proportion of patients do not recover. This can be attributed to potential adverse effects of&#xD;
      the intravenous treatment (IVT) prior to MT. These effects could include neurotoxicity, blood&#xD;
      brain barrier leakage and thrombus fragmentation through softening of the thrombus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Another reason for non-recovery in MRCLEAN was the occurrence of symptomatic intracranial&#xD;
      hemorrhage (sICH) in 7% of patients, which was fatal in 65%. sICH occurred as often in the&#xD;
      intervention as in the control group, suggesting that this complication could not be&#xD;
      attributed to the MT, but rather to pre-treatment with IVT. Therefore, the investigators&#xD;
      hypothesize that direct MT may lead to a 8% absolute increase in good outcome compared to MT&#xD;
      preceded by IVT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: To assess whether direct MT is non-inferior compared to combined IVT plus MT in&#xD;
      patients with AIS due to an anterior circulation LVO, and to assess treatment effect&#xD;
      modification by presence of ICAD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design: This is a multicenter, prospective, open label parallel group trial with&#xD;
      blinded outcome assessment (PROBE design) assessing non-inferiority of direct MT compared to&#xD;
      combined IVT plus MT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population: Patients with acute ischemic stroke and a confirmed anterior circulation&#xD;
      occlusion by CTA. Initiation of IVT must be feasible within 4.5 hours from symptom onset. Age&#xD;
      must be 18 or over and NIHSS 2 or more.&#xD;
&#xD;
      INCLUSION CRITERIA&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  a clinical diagnosis of acute ischemic stroke,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  caused by a large vessel occlusion of the anterior circulation (intracranial carotid&#xD;
           artery or middle M1/proximal M2) cerebral artery confirmed by CTA,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  CT or MRI ruling out intracranial hemorrhage,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  eligible for IVT and MT (within 4.5 hours after symptom onset),&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  a score of at least 2 on the NIH Stroke Scale,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  age of 18 years or older,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  written informed consent. EXCLUSION CRITERIA&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pre-stroke disability which interferes with the assessment of functional outcome at 90&#xD;
           days, i.e. mRS &gt;2&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Any contra-indication for IVT, according to guidelines of the American Heart&#xD;
           Association, i.e.:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  arterial blood pressure exceeding 185/110 mmHg&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  blood glucose less than 2.7 or over 22.2 mmol/L&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  cerebral infarction in the previous 6 weeks with residual neurological deficit or&#xD;
                signs of recent infarction on neuro-imaging&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  serious head trauma in the previous 3 months&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  major surgery or serious trauma in the previous 2 weeks&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  gastrointestinal or urinary tract hemorrhage in the previous 3 weeks&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  previous intracerebral hemorrhage&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  use of anticoagulant with INR exceeding 1.7&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  known thrombocyte count less than 100 x 109/L&#xD;

&#xD;
             -  treatment with heparin (APTT exceeds the upper limit of normal value) in the&#xD;
                previous 48 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention: The intervention group will undergo immediate MT using a stent retriever, as&#xD;
      recommended by the steering committee. The standard care group will receive IVT 0.9 mg/kg&#xD;
      with a maximum dose of 90 mg in one hour, followed by MT using a stent retriever. the&#xD;
      investigators strive to reduce delays associated with IVT administration to a minimum to&#xD;
      adequately assess the effect of IVT itself with MT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main study parameters/outcomes: The primary outcome is the score on the modified Rankin Scale&#xD;
      assessed blindly at 90 (+/- 14) days. An common odds ratio, adjusted for the prognostic&#xD;
      factors (age, NIHSS, collateral score), representing the shift on the 6-category mRS scale&#xD;
      measured at 3 months, estimated with ordinal logistic regression, will be the primary effect&#xD;
      parameter.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcomes: 1. death within 90 +/- 14 days; 2. pre-interventional reperfusion&#xD;
      assessed on first intracranial DSA; 3. eTICI19 score on final angiography of MT; 4. score on&#xD;
      the NIHSS at 24 +/- 6 hours and 5-7 days, or at discharge; 5. recanalization rate at 24-72h&#xD;
      by CTA; 6. Final lesion volume at 5-7 days on NCCT20; 7. score on the EuroQoL 5-dimensions&#xD;
      5-level (EQ5D-5L)21 and Barthel index22 at 90 +/- 14 days; 8. dichotomous clinical outcome on&#xD;
      the mRS at 90 +/- 14 days.&#xD;
