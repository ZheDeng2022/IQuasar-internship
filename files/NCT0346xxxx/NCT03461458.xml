      This study is a prospective, phase I dose-escalation study evaluating the safety and&#xD;
      feasibility of intradiscally injected AD-MSCs in the treatment of painful degenerative disc&#xD;
      disease. The investigators propose a blended open enrollment protocol of four cohorts, each&#xD;
      comprised of 3 subjects, to allow for interim analysis following the completion of each&#xD;
      cohort to review safety data prior to commencing treatment of the next cohort. A total of 12&#xD;
      subjects will be enrolled. Subjects will be screened at outpatient clinic visit appointments&#xD;
      and interested qualified subjects will be consented and offered participation in this trial.&#xD;
      Once consent has been obtained baseline values will be established and subjects will begin&#xD;
      treatment and follow-up for the next 24 months. Baseline data will include physical&#xD;
      examination of the axial skeleton and sacroiliac region, neurologic examination, clinical&#xD;
      assessment of low back pain and function using validated Patient Reported Outcome Measures&#xD;
      (PROMs), radiographs, peripheral blood analysis, and MRI imaging.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Abdominal fat will be harvested through a small incision and processed by the Mayo Clinic&#xD;
      IMPACT laboratory using current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMPs) and previously&#xD;
      established standard operating procedures (SOPs) to produce clinical grade, autologous,&#xD;
      culture-expanded AD-MSCs for subsequent intradiscal injection. All injections will be&#xD;
      performed using fluoroscopic guidance and all patients will be clinically evaluated&#xD;
      immediately after procedure and at week 2 and 4 post-treatment to assess for acute adverse&#xD;
      events (AEs). Following completion of their respective treatment cycle, each subject will be&#xD;
      followed for study endpoints using a predetermined protocol, including clinical evaluation,&#xD;
      radiography, MRI, and peripheral blood analysis. A final visit for evaluation and imaging&#xD;
      will be conducted at the end of the study.&#xD;
