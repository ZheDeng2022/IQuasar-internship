  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The long-term study goal is to develop a more engaging, motivating gait biofeedback&#xD;
      methodologies specifically designed for post-stroke gait training. The current project aims&#xD;
      to address fundamental questions regarding the optimal methodology to deliver AGRF&#xD;
      biofeedback during gait, and the feasibility and preliminary efficacy of AGRF progression&#xD;
      protocols for improved gait patterns and gait function. The study objectives are to (1)&#xD;
      evaluate the immediate effects of biofeedback training methodology on gait biomechanics; and&#xD;
      (2) evaluate the feasibility and short-term effects on gait performance of a real-time&#xD;
      biofeedback protocol incorporating progression criteria (similar to those employed during&#xD;
      clinical rehabilitative training).&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Even after discharge from rehabilitation, residual gait deficits are prevalent in stroke&#xD;
      survivors, leading to decreased walking speed and endurance. Because gait dysfunctions limit&#xD;
      community mobility, stroke survivors and rehabilitation clinicians consider restoration of&#xD;
      walking a major goal of rehabilitation. Biomechanical impairments, such as reduced knee and&#xD;
      ankle flexion during swing phase negatively affect gait function and increase the risk for&#xD;
      falls. During the stance phase, decreased contribution of the paretic leg to forward&#xD;
      propulsion during paretic terminal stance is a critical post-stroke gait deficit shown to be&#xD;
      correlated with hemiparetic severity, walking speed, and gait asymmetry. These gait deficits&#xD;
      can lead to falls, increased energy cost of gait, and decreased endurance. Also, a slowed&#xD;
      self-selected walking speed is one of the hallmarks of post-stroke gait, and greatly limits&#xD;
      community participation in individuals post-stroke. Very few interventions provide targeted&#xD;
      practice of biomechanically appropriate movement patterns exclusively or preferentially to&#xD;
      the paretic leg. Biofeedback can enhance an individual's awareness of the impairment targeted&#xD;
      during gait training, enabling self-correction of aberrant gait patterns. Real-time&#xD;
      biofeedback gait training has been used for modulating step length asymmetry in people&#xD;
      post-stroke. A recent study developed a protocol combining treadmill training with visual and&#xD;
      auditory real-time biofeedback to increase anterior ground reaction force (AGRF). AGRF&#xD;
      biofeedback may be a beneficial strategy to target unilateral propulsion deficits in people&#xD;
      post-stroke. The goal of this study is to develop improved methodologies for AGRF gait&#xD;
      biofeedback and to evaluate the feasibility and short-term effects of gait biofeedback. To&#xD;
      achieve this goal, experiments will be performed on young able-bodied individuals as well as&#xD;
      stroke survivors.&#xD;
