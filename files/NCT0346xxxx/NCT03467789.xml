  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to study 50 patients with multiple Basal Cell Carcinoma (BCC)&#xD;
      who will be receiving Photodynamic Therapy (PDT) as treatment for their tumors. This study&#xD;
      wants to establish the optimal conditions for treating BCC tumors with PDT. Previous research&#xD;
      suggests that taking Vitamin D prior to the start of PDT could help improve the effectiveness&#xD;
      of the treatment in eliminating the BCC. Overall, this study will help establish oral Vitamin&#xD;
      D3/PDT as a new combination therapy for skin cancer (BCC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Photodynamic Therapy (PDT) is an investigational (experimental) technique that works by&#xD;
      combining a photosensitizing topical agent and an intense light source to kill tumor cells.&#xD;
      PDT is currently approved for the treatment of BCC in Europe, Canada, and Australia. However,&#xD;
      it is experimental in the United States because it is not approved by the Food and Drug&#xD;
      Administration (FDA).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The overall hypothesis is that PDT could provide exceptional benefit in patients with Basal&#xD;
      Cell Nevus Syndrome (BCNS) and multiple BCC tumors because PDT is nonmutagenic, nonscarring,&#xD;
      and can be safely repeated many times. The specific study hypothesis is that Vitamin D might&#xD;
      be useful as a neoadjuvant to improve tumor responses to PDT. In preclinical studies, the&#xD;
      investigators showed that epithelial tumors are more responsive to aminolevulinic acid&#xD;
      (ALA)-based PDT when &quot;primed&quot; by pre-exposure to the dietary form of Vitamin D&#xD;
      (cholecalciferol, D3). This study will test the hypothesis that oral D3 supplements,&#xD;
      administered over a relatively short time, can boost the effectiveness of PDT for cutaneous&#xD;
      (BCC) in this patient population. Patients with BCNS and multiple BCC, or normal patients&#xD;
      with at least 3 BCC tumors, will be enrolled. They will receive three PDT treatments, at&#xD;
      two-month intervals, over a 6 month period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objective&#xD;
&#xD;
      â€¢ To determine tumor clinical clearance rates after neoadjuvant D3/PDT, and after PDT alone.&#xD;
      To accomplish this, the first two PDT treatments in each study patient will be randomized,&#xD;
      i.e. one PDT session will be performed after D3 pretreatment, the other without any&#xD;
      pretreatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objective(s)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the level of PpIX accumulation in BCC lesions at various treatment visits, in&#xD;
           the absence or presence of neoadjuvant D3. (Fluorescence dosimetry measurements)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess tolerability of the technique. (Pain scale measurements)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess patient satisfaction with the technique. (Cosmetic result, and questionnaire)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess D3 serum levels (in serum) and VDR status (in leukocyte DNA), and correlate&#xD;
           these results to clinical outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this clinical study, each patient will serve as his or her own control with respect to BCC&#xD;
      tumor responsiveness to neoadjuvant D3 supplementation. The first two PDT treatments will be&#xD;
      randomized. Thus, patients in Group A will take D3 pills prior to the first PDT treatment,&#xD;
      and placebo pills prior to the second PDT treatment. For patients in Group B, the order is&#xD;
      reversed. Total amounts of D3 supplementation given will be adjusted, based upon serum&#xD;
      25-hydroxy-D3 levels found at baseline. Patients with VD deficiency will take 14 days of&#xD;
      neoadjuvant D3, vs. only 5 days if the initial VD level is normal.&#xD;

The statistical significance of the difference in Delta-T after D3+PDT versus the difference in Delta-T after PDT alone will be tested using ANOVA.</description>
