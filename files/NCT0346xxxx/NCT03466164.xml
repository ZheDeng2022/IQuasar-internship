    <textblock>
      This project focuses on understanding the cognitive and neural mechanisms by which&#xD;
      mindfulness training (MT) results in positive behavioral change and enhanced psychological&#xD;
      well-being. Participants will complete two sets of cognitive tasks during functional magnetic&#xD;
      resonance imaging (fMRI) and either be assigned to an MT intervention between scan sets or&#xD;
      after scan sets.&#xD;

      This project focuses on understanding the cognitive and neural mechanisms by which&#xD;
      mindfulness training (MT) results in positive behavioral change and enhanced psychological&#xD;
      well-being. Although MT is rapidly gaining in popularity as a life-style intervention, there&#xD;
      are still critical gaps in our understanding of its primary mechanism of action. Current&#xD;
      theoretical frameworks suggest that MT operates by improving attentional control, emotional&#xD;
      regulation, and self-awareness capabilities, potentially by targeting neuroplastic brain&#xD;
      mechanisms of executive control. This suggests an important role for cognitive neuroscience&#xD;
      research, but current work is still in its infancy, and subject to a number of&#xD;
      well-recognized methodological and conceptual limitations. The proposed project aims to&#xD;
      systematically remedy these limitations of prior MT research, by leveraging the unique&#xD;
      opportunities offered by the Human Connectome Project (HCP), and on-going NIH R01-funded&#xD;
      research. A key feature of the project is the use of a randomized, longitudinal discordant&#xD;
      twin design, in which monozygotic (MZ; identical) twin pairs will be recruited, with one&#xD;
      co-twin randomly assigned to the MT condition (mindfulness-based stress reduction, or MBSR;&#xD;
      the most-validated and standardized form of MT instruction) and the other serving as a&#xD;
      (wait-list) control. Each co-twin will undergo extensive behavioral and MRI neuroimaging&#xD;
      assessments in a pre/post fashion, before and after the MT (or no-contact control)&#xD;
      intervention, to test for specific MT-related effects. The discordant twin design, though&#xD;
      never previously employed in an MT context, is widely recognized as one of the strongest for&#xD;
      causal inference, since it avoids many of the challenges and confounds associated with&#xD;
      inadequately matched control groups, and enables twin-pair focused analyses, which greatly&#xD;
      increase statistical power. The investigators will use this design to investigate&#xD;
      theoretically-focused hypotheses that stem from a guiding framework regarding the neural&#xD;
      mechanisms of cognitive control. Specifically, using a newly developed cognitive control task&#xD;
      battery, the investigator will test the counter-intuitive hypothesis that MT produces an&#xD;
      enhancement in the neural mechanism and circuits associated with reactive (rather than&#xD;
      proactive) control. An additional subset of MZ twin participants will undergo retesting with&#xD;
      the original HCP protocol, in order to provide a comprehensive assessment and comparison of&#xD;
      MT effect sizes across multiple domains of cognitive and brain function. Success in this&#xD;
      project will have high relevance for public health, by providing innovative experimental&#xD;
      tools and a novel theoretical framework from which to empirically evaluate and better&#xD;
      understand the potential impact of MT programs as lifestyle interventions for enhancing&#xD;
      psychological well-being in healthy populations.&#xD;
