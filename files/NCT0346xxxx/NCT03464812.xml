  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposed study has been developed to evaluate patient, physician, and provider (educator)&#xD;
      centered barriers to and facilitators for engaging in the Diabetes Self Management Education&#xD;
      and Support (DSMES) and developing a patient-centered, physician supported DSMES program that&#xD;
      could potentially address barriers shared by the patients and their healthcare professionals&#xD;
      (Phase 1). The feasibility and efficacy of the newly developed program will be evaluated with&#xD;
      an ethnically diverse cohort of 90 patients with type 2 diabetes (30 Caucasians, Asians, and&#xD;
      Hispanics each) (Phase 2). A variety of outcomes including clinical, behavioral and&#xD;
      psycho-social measures will be used to assess program acceptability and effectiveness.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Diabetes is a chronic and a progressive metabolic disorder which necessitates active patient&#xD;
      involvement to effectively manage nutrition, physical activity, and medication for optimal&#xD;
      outcomes. Self-management is a critical aspect of diabetes care and a variety of studies have&#xD;
      established the need for people with diabetes to be knowledgeable about their condition and&#xD;
      be actively involved in its management to effectively reduce the risk of future health&#xD;
      complications and improve other outcomes. Diabetes self-management education and support&#xD;
      (DSMES) can help patients effectively engage in and perform their diabetes-related self-care&#xD;
      activities. However, only a small number of patients with diabetes participate in DSMES. A&#xD;
      few studies in this area have highlighted both physician and patient-related factors that&#xD;
      could affect the receipt of DSMES. Patients' involvement in a DSMES program continues to be&#xD;
      largely prompted by a physician referral and it has been suggested that improving physician&#xD;
      involvement in the DSMES process could enhance overall patient engagement and adherence to&#xD;
      such programs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As part of the proposed mixed methods study, in Phase 1, in-depth surveys (or interviews)&#xD;
      will be undertaken with: (a) physicians caring for people with type 2 diabetes, (b) DSMES&#xD;
      providers (e.g., certified diabetes educators, diabetes nurses, dietitians), and (b) patients&#xD;
      with type 2 diabetes regarding their perception of diabetes education programs, barriers, and&#xD;
      facilitators to engagement. Findings from Phase 1 will be shared with the education team at a&#xD;
      diabetes center in a community hospital in Orange County, California to inform changes to&#xD;
      their currently existing diabetes education curriculum to make it more patient-centered and&#xD;
      improve physician engagement and support. As part of Phase 2, the newly developed program&#xD;
      will be implemented with a diverse cohort of 90 patients with type 2 diabetes. Patient&#xD;
      participation (attendance) in the DSMES process will be documented as a primary marker of&#xD;
      patient engagement while their clinical and psycho-social outcomes will serve as secondary&#xD;
      indicators. Among other outcomes, physician, educator, and patient satisfaction with the&#xD;
      newly developed referral process will also be assessed as a measure of intervention&#xD;
      acceptability and success.&#xD;
