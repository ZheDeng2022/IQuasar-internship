  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will assess the feasibility of remotely guided US use by individuals without&#xD;
      ultrasound training to assess for normal lung parenchyma in healthy volunteers. The untrained&#xD;
      operators (operators) will perform US examinations of lung under the guidance of a medical&#xD;
      professional (professional) with experience in ultrasound technique. The professional will&#xD;
      guide the operator step by step on how to conduct an US exam of the 'patient's' lung. Images&#xD;
      will then be saved and reviewed at a later time by an ultrasound expert to determine quality&#xD;
      and clinical functionality in recognizing normal lung parenchyma. This simulation will be&#xD;
      analogous to an untrained US operator assessing a potentially ill patient with the assistance&#xD;
      of a remotely located physician. An example of this would be an astronaut with respiratory&#xD;
      distress after experiencing a rapid decompression event being evaluated by another healthy&#xD;
      astronaut by US under the guidance of the flight surgeon at Mission Control.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Volunteers will meet with study personnel in the Clinical Skills Center at Stonybrook&#xD;
      University. Informed consent will be obtained from all groups ('operators', 'patients',&#xD;
      'clinicians'). A survey will be conducted to evaluate the subjects' prior experience in&#xD;
      ultrasound. Subjects who qualify will continue to participate in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The 'patient' will initially be evaluated by US by an expert and 'ideal' images will be&#xD;
      captured and stored for later comparison against those obtained by 'operators'.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The 'operator' will be given an smart phone/table with video communication function and will&#xD;
      be connected with the US 'expert', who will be located in a different room, physically and&#xD;
      audibly out of range. For the first portion of the study, the 'expert' will instruct the&#xD;
      'operator' on how to conduct an US exam limited to the lung. Using the two-way video and&#xD;
      audio communication through the video communication application, the expert will guide to the&#xD;
      operator on how to utilize the US machine, where to place the probe, and how to capture and&#xD;
      save images. The 'patient' will be instructed not to assist the 'operator' in any way. For&#xD;
      the second portion of the study, the 'operator' will utilize the US machine to conduct a&#xD;
      similarly limited lung exam on themselves, again with the assistance of the 'expert' but no&#xD;
      other study personnel.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Finally, the 'clinicians' will carry out similarly limited lung exams on the 'patient', first&#xD;
      without instruction from the 'expert' and then again under similar guidance as the previous&#xD;
      portions of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During all portions of the study, time to image capture will be measured by observing&#xD;
      personnel. All captured images will be sent to expert reviewers at which time a quality score&#xD;
      will be generated. The score will be generated based off of the clinical utility of the&#xD;
      image, general image quality, and several technical components of the image. Please see the&#xD;
      accompanying Score Sheet for further details. Reviewers will be blinded as to the origin of&#xD;
      the images ('operator' vs. 'clinician'). Scores obtained from 'operators' will be compared&#xD;
      against those of 'clinicians'. Reviewers will be comprised of three experts in the field of&#xD;
      US, all MDs who have received formal training in US and have at least 5 years of clinical US&#xD;
      practice experience. Each captured image will be reviewed and scored by all three reviewers.&#xD;

    <description>Ultrasound experts will blindly evaluate images obtained from both untrained and trained groups. Using the 'Ultrasound Quality Scorecard', evaluators will assess the quality of the image obtained and the technique carried out to obtain the image. These quality and technique criteria include 'Discernable Lung Parenchyma', 'Presence of A-lines', 'Lack of Obstruction from Rib Shadowing', 'Correct Probe Selection', Correct Depth Setting', 'Correct Gain Selection'. For each criterion (both quality and technique), a binary 'Yes/No' score will be given. Total 'Yes' scores will be summed for each ultrasound exam (minimum 0, maximum 6), with the higher number of 'Yes' responses signifying a higher quality ultrasound exam. Each ultrasound exam will be scored by three separate experts, with the average of the three scores being reported as the 'final score'.</description>
