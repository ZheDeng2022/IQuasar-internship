  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Societal changes have resulted in reduced demands to be active and increased daily time spent&#xD;
      sitting. Sedentary behavior (SB) has been linked to many health problems such as type 2&#xD;
      diabetes and heart disease. Office-working adults are a high-risk population for excessive&#xD;
      SB. Increasing the length and frequency of breaks from sitting and increasing the time spent&#xD;
      standing and engaged in light physical activity are ways to decrease SB. The purpose of this&#xD;
      study is to determine whether combining a Health Action Process Approach-based&#xD;
      (theory-driven), specifically action and coping planning intervention, with a tailored text&#xD;
      messaging intervention can reduce workplace sitting time among adult office workers.&#xD;
      Participants in the intervention group will receive one behavioural counselling session,&#xD;
      followed by daily, tailored text messages over a 6-week period, with a focus on encouraging&#xD;
      them to reduce their occupational sitting time by increasing their frequency and duration of&#xD;
      breaks from sitting, as well as time spent standing and engaged in light-intensity physical&#xD;
      activity. It is expected that office-working adults who receive the planning intervention and&#xD;
      tailored text messages will report greater increases in non-sedentary behaviours (e.g., break&#xD;
      frequency, break duration, standing, light physical activity) than those who do not receive&#xD;
      the intervention.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Using a randomized controlled trial design, the purpose of this study will be to examine&#xD;
      whether combining a HAPA-based intervention, specifically action and coping planning, with a&#xD;
      tailored text message intervention can reduce workplace sitting time by increasing frequency&#xD;
      and length of breaks from sitting and non-exercise activity thermogenesis (NEAT) behaviours&#xD;
      (i.e., standing, light-intensity physical activity) among office-working adults. A secondary&#xD;
      purpose will be to examine the effects of the intervention on participants' action planning,&#xD;
      coping planning and action control regarding reducing their workplace sitting time, as well&#xD;
      as self-rated work performance and health-related outcomes (i.e., role limitations due to&#xD;
      physical health, role limitations due to personal or emotional problems, emotional&#xD;
      well-being, and energy/fatigue). Another secondary objective will be to determine if action&#xD;
      and coping planning and action control towards reducing workplace sitting time are related to&#xD;
      actual break behaviour, time spent standing, and time spent in light-intensity physical&#xD;
      activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If successful, participants in the intervention group (sedentary intervention group) will&#xD;
      report reduced workplace sitting time, and greater break frequency and break duration, time&#xD;
      spent standing, and time spent in light-intensity physical activity, compared to participants&#xD;
      in the control group (no treatment). In addition, it is hypothesized that participants in the&#xD;
      intervention group will report greater action and coping planning and action control towards&#xD;
      reducing workplace sitting time, as well as improved work- and health-related outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will employ a prospective, 2-group, repeated measures, randomized controlled trial&#xD;
      (RCT) design. Participants will be full-time adult, office workers primarily recruited from&#xD;
      large businesses and office spaces.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Potential participants (estimated enrolment: 112) will be recruited by Andrew Scott Rollo,&#xD;
      Principal Investigator, for this study. Relevant contacts/liaisons and/or senior executives&#xD;
      (i.e., Head of Human Resources, President, Chief Executive Officer, Office Manager) at&#xD;
      potential businesses of interest will be sought out via publically available sources (e.g.,&#xD;
      London Chamber of Commerce Business Directory, company websites, etc.) and contacted via&#xD;
      email. The email will include a letter of information (LOI) and recruitment poster and&#xD;
      request the individual's assistance with recruitment. For each business/office, if the&#xD;
      individual accepts the invitation and informs the researchers that he/she is willing to aid&#xD;
      with the recruitment process, the individual will then be asked to email all full-time&#xD;
      employees in their respective office/business and offer them the opportunity to participate.&#xD;
      In this recruitment email, the recruitment poster and Letter of Information will be provided.&#xD;
      Participants will be instructed to contact the researcher via email and/or phone if they wish&#xD;
      to participate or receive additional details prior to making a decision as to whether to&#xD;
      participate. A second recruitment approach will involve recruiting full-time adult, office&#xD;
      workers through recruitment posters distributed through social media (i.e., Facebook,&#xD;
      LinkedIn) and public advertisements (i.e., transit stations, newspapers). The study will also&#xD;
      be advertised through emails sent out to various faculties at Western University. Recruitment&#xD;
      posters and LOIs will be posted on social media and in public spaces. As stated previous,&#xD;
      office-workers interested in the study will be instructed to contact the researcher via email&#xD;
      and/or phone to sign up for study participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At this point of contact, an email response will be sent to any interested individual. Adult&#xD;
      office-workers who choose to take part in this study will receive a link via email that&#xD;
      directs them to the Letter of Information, Informed Consent, and questionnaire for assessment&#xD;
      of baseline measurements, which will be administered through a third party website called&#xD;
      SoSci (online survey service). Participants will be assured that participation in this study&#xD;
      is voluntary, that they are free to discontinue and withdraw from the study at any time, and&#xD;
      that they may choose to skip any questions that they do not wish to answer without any effect&#xD;
      on their employment status/work conditions. In other words, refusing to participate, refusing&#xD;
      to answer any questions or withdrawing from the study will not impact their employment beyond&#xD;
      potentially not receiving benefits associated with study participation. After viewing the&#xD;
      Letter of Information and indicating that they consent to participate in the study (by&#xD;
      clicking &quot;I agree&quot; on the survey), participants will be asked to complete a brief&#xD;
      demographics questionnaire, followed by a questionnaire for baseline assessment of primary&#xD;
      and secondary outcomes. In the initial email response sent to potential participants,&#xD;
      participants randomized into the intervention group will also be asked to provide a day and&#xD;
      time (within 3 days of completing the baseline assessment) that they would be available to&#xD;
      schedule the behavioural counselling session they will receive.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Upon completion of the Baseline assessment and prior to intervention delivery, all&#xD;
      participants will be randomized, using computer-generated randomized stratification, into&#xD;
      either a 6-week HAPA-treatment (SB-related planning + text messages intervention) or&#xD;
      waitlisted control (no treatment) condition. For those in the treatment group, the study&#xD;
      objective will be to reduce workplace sitting time by increasing non-sedentary or NEAT&#xD;
      behaviours (i.e., increasing break frequency to a break every 30-45 minutes, with each break&#xD;
      having a duration of 2-4 minutes, and increasing their time spent standing and engaged in&#xD;
      light-intensity PA. Participants randomly assigned to the control group will receive no&#xD;
      information or intervention of any kind and will only be asked to complete the outcome&#xD;
      questionnaires.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the agreed upon and scheduled time, the researcher will deliver the intervention (i.e.,&#xD;
      implement the appropriate HAPA-based behavioural counselling session involving action and&#xD;
      coping planning) either in person OR electronically via phone and an online presentation&#xD;
      website (www.zoho.com). The method of delivery will entirely depend on the participant's&#xD;
      availability, preference, and whether they live within driving distance of the investigator.&#xD;
      To ensure equal numbers of local and remote participants in both conditions, two&#xD;
      computer-generated random number lists will be created by the lead investigator using an&#xD;
      online research randomization program. Participants will be asked to complete a second&#xD;
      informed consent (written informed consent) at this time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The one-on-one counseling sessions will be delivered by the principal investigator to ensure&#xD;
      standardization between participants. During the counseling session, the researcher will&#xD;
      first ask if the participant has any strategies that he/she would like to try or think would&#xD;
      be effective. As much as possible, strategies will be kept as original and specific to the&#xD;
      participant's lifestyle as possible, while still fulfilling the study objectives. Upon&#xD;
      creation of each strategy, the researcher will ask the participant if they think that the&#xD;
      strategy they came up with is realistic. The number of strategies will also be personalized&#xD;
      depending on how the participant's baseline measures compare to the objectives of their&#xD;
      treatment group. This will be done in order to attenuate for any neglected/unused strategies&#xD;
      by those with larger differences between baseline and objective values. Similarly, coping&#xD;
      strategies will be created alongside each strategy in order to boost the adherence to the&#xD;
      developed strategies. When an action plan strategy is developed, the researcher will ask the&#xD;
      participant &quot;what are some challenges you foresee with executing this strategy?&quot;, followed by&#xD;
      &quot;what do you think is something we can do in order to overcome this/these challenges?&quot; This&#xD;
      will be done in order to keep the coping strategies personalized to the participant's&#xD;
      lifestyle. Overall, the behavioral counseling sessions will take between 20-30 minutes to&#xD;
      complete and both groups will receive equal contact time. Participants will be given the form&#xD;
      with their action plan and coping strategies and told to display it somewhere prominent so&#xD;
      they will be reminded of the strategies. The principal investigator will conduct the planning&#xD;
      interventions in a non-interfering manner by providing brief instructions and then remaining&#xD;
      available to answer any questions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At this point, participants in the intervention group will then be entered into a contact&#xD;
      list on the text-messaging website called &quot;Oh Don't Forget.&quot; &quot;Oh Don't Forget,&quot; is a&#xD;
      Web-based application that works through &quot;Recess Mobile&quot; to send messages from a computer to&#xD;
      mobile phone numbers that are programmed into the application. All participants will begin&#xD;
      receiving tailored text messages the day after receiving their one-on-one counseling session.&#xD;
      Every participant will receive the same daily texts as each other participant in their group,&#xD;
      with times varying slightly depending on their schedule. As planning is an ongoing process,&#xD;
      participants will be reminded (via text message) to formulate another set of action and&#xD;
      coping plans at the beginning of weeks 3 and 5. Upon completion of the intervention period at&#xD;
      6 weeks, participants will be notified that they will no longer be receiving text messages&#xD;
      and that the study is completed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the initial behavioural counseling session, participants will be told they will receive&#xD;
      a link to a questionnaire (assessment of primary and secondary outcomes) in their email every&#xD;
      2 weeks, for the next 6 weeks (i.e., weeks 2, 4, and 6), and to complete the questionnaire&#xD;
      the day they receive it. Participants will also be told that 2 weeks following the end of the&#xD;
      6-week intervention, there will be a follow-up questionnaire (week 8), which they will&#xD;
      receive and be asked to complete. All primary and secondary outcome questionnaires will be&#xD;
      completed online and administered through a third party website called SoSci (online survey&#xD;
      service). Participants will also be reminded via text to complete these. Primary outcomes&#xD;
      including frequency of breaks, length of breaks, and NEAT behaviours at work (i.e., standing,&#xD;
      light-intensity PA) will be assessed using subjective, self-report approaches. Secondary&#xD;
      analyses will be performed to examine effects of the intervention on theoretical determinants&#xD;
      of behaviour change (i.e., action planning, coping planning, action control), as well as&#xD;
      participants' perceived work-related outcomes (i.e., self-rated work performance) and&#xD;
      health-related outcomes (i.e., role limitations due to physical health, role limitations due&#xD;
      to personal or emotional problems, emotional well-being, and energy/fatigue). All primary&#xD;
      outcomes will be assessed at four time points (baseline, 2, 4, and 6 weeks), and again at a&#xD;
      two-week follow-up (8 weeks). Action and coping planning and action control towards reducing&#xD;
      workplace sitting time will be assessed at the same time points. Secondary outcome variables&#xD;
      (i.e., perceived work- and health-related outcomes) will be assessed pre- (baseline) and&#xD;
      post-intervention (6 weeks).&#xD;

Participants will be asked to form 3-4 actions/coping plans specifying when, where, how, and for how long they would reduce workplace sitting time; and anticipate potential barriers and identify ways they could be overcome. Strategies will focus on increasing break frequency to every 30-45 minutes, achieving a break duration of 2-3 minutes, and increasing standing and light-intensity PA time, during work hours. Participants will receive sedentary behaviour-related text messages twice daily, depending on their preferences and schedule, which will act as mini-booster interventions.</description>
