  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well pembrolizumab and sunitinib malate work in treating&#xD;
      participants with thymic cancer that has spread to other places in the body or cannot be&#xD;
      removed by surgery and does not respond to treatment. Monoclonal antibodies, such as&#xD;
      pembrolizumab, may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Sunitinib&#xD;
      malate may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell&#xD;
      growth. Giving pembrolizumab and sunitinib malate may work better in treating thymic cancer.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate the efficacy of pembrolizumab and sunitinib malate (sunitinib) for the&#xD;
      treatment of patients with thymic carcinoma that have progressed on prior platinum based&#xD;
      chemotherapy as measured by objective response rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate the safety profile and toxicity of combination pembrolizumab and sunitinib&#xD;
      malate as per Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version (v) 4.0.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To evaluate the progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) of patients&#xD;
      treated with combination pembrolizumab and sunitinib.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine objective response rate (ORR), PFS, and OS by PD-L1 expression &gt; 50% tumor&#xD;
      proportion score (TPS) (by 22C3 assay) II. To determine whether sunitinib treatment leads to&#xD;
      increase in PD-L1 expression and tumor infiltrating lymphocytes and decrease in&#xD;
      myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSC) in both tumor and peripheral blood.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants receive pembrolizumab intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on day 1 and sunitinib&#xD;
      malate orally (PO) daily on days 1-14. Courses repeat every 21 days for 24 months in the&#xD;
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of the study treatment, participants are followed up for 30 days, every 6&#xD;
      weeks for 1 year, and every 9 or 12 weeks thereafter.&#xD;

    <time_frame>Up to 24 months</time_frame>
    <description>Response will be defined for patients with measurable disease and who receive at least one dose of combination treatment. Exact binomial 95% confidence intervals for the true PR + CR response rate will be calculated.</description>

    <measure>Incidence of adverse events evaluated according to National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 4.0</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 30 days after the last dose of treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Frequency and severity of adverse events and tolerability of the regimen in each of the treatment arms will be collected and summarized using descriptive statistics. The maximum grade for each type of toxicity will be recorded for each patient, and frequency tables will be reviewed to determine toxicity patterns. Events will be summarized based on frequency and proportion of total subjects, by system organ class and preferred term. Separate summaries with descriptive statistics (counts, percentage, mean, standard deviation, etc.) will be given for all AEs, treatment-related AEs, AEs by toxicity grade, serious adverse events and AEs leading to discontinuation of study treatment and dose modification. The incidence of deaths and the primary cause of death will be summarized.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Overall survival (OS)</measure>
    <time_frame>From study registration up to 24 months</time_frame>
    <description>OS is defined as the duration from study registration to death due to any cause, whichever comes first. Patients last known to be alive will be censored at the date of last contact.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Progression free survival (PFS)</measure>
    <time_frame>From study registration up to 24 months</time_frame>
    <description>PFS is defined as the duration from study registration to progression, symptomatic deterioration, or death due to any cause, whichever comes first. Patients last known to be alive and progression-free will be censored at the date of [last contact or disease assessment].

    <time_frame>Up to 24 months</time_frame>
    <description>22C3 assay will be used, reported as tumor proportion score (TPS)% from 0-100%). It will be assessed how PD-L1 expression levels correspond with achievement of response to treatment. PD-L1 level will be assessed as both a continuous variable and dichotomized (less than or greater than 50% TPS expression).</description>
