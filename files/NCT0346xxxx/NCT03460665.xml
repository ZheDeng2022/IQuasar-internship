    <textblock>
      The aim of this double-blind, randomized, single-center prospective study (patient and&#xD;
      evaluator) is to evaluate the efficacy of arterial occlusion (embolization) of neovessels by&#xD;
      microparticle versus placebo on pain in disabling knee osteoarthritis at 12 months.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Rational: in the normal state, the articular cartilage is devoid of vessels and innervation.&#xD;
      In osteoarthritic cartilage, neovascularization is observed and is accompanied by a sensitive&#xD;
      neoinnervation. The development of these neovessels also contributes to the structural damage&#xD;
      of cartilage by achieving a real &quot;perforation&quot;of the cartilage. Studies designate&#xD;
      neovascularization as a target for new therapeutic. In two non-comparative open-label&#xD;
      studies, a Japanese team has shown that endovascular occlusion of these neovessels in&#xD;
      patients with knee osteoarthritis significantly reduced the patient pain without any&#xD;
      complication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this double-blind, randomized, single-center prospective study (patient and&#xD;
      evaluator) is to evaluate the efficacy of arterial occlusion (embolization) of neovessels by&#xD;
      microparticle versus placebo on pain in disabling knee osteoarthritis at 12 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective is to evaluate the effectiveness of embolization on the pain of patients&#xD;
      with disabling osteoarthritis by double-blind comparison of two groups: the first control&#xD;
      group will include patients who will benefit from arteriography and an injection of saline in&#xD;
      their neovessels, the second group called treatment will consist of patients whose neovessels&#xD;
      will be occluded by inert microparticles of 75 µm. The pain will be evaluated in both groups&#xD;
      before and 12 months after embolisation. The objective is to show that the pain is&#xD;
      significantly less important in the group of patients whose neovessels have been occluded&#xD;
      with microparticles in comparison to the control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives are to evaluate the effectiveness of neovascular embolization on pain at&#xD;
      1, 6, 24 and 36 months; knee stiffness, physical activity, quality of life, at 1, 6, 12, 24&#xD;
      and 36 months; the structural course of knee osteoarthritis at 12, 24 and 36 months; the use&#xD;
      of arthroplasty at 24 and 36 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population: Patients aged 40 to 80 years with knee osteoarthritis with a visual&#xD;
      analogue scale (VAS) score greater than or equal to 50 mm for at least 3 months optimal&#xD;
      medical treatment, whose radiological stage of osteoarthritis according to Kellgren and&#xD;
      Lawence is 2 or 3 and does not have a knee prosthesis surgical indication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary endpoint: modification of the pain item of the self-administered Knee injury and&#xD;
      Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS) collected in the 15 days preceding the procedure and at&#xD;
      12 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary evaluation criteria are KOOS, EQ-5D (Quality of Life Scale) in the 15 days&#xD;
      preceding the procedure and then at 1, 6, 24 and 36 months; knee radiographs, number of&#xD;
      patients who had 12, 24 and 36 months of joint replacement surgery; knee MRI at 12 months;&#xD;
      the use of analgesics and anti-inflammatories; adverse events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expected benefits: confirm the results of the non-randomized studies that showed a clear&#xD;
      decrease in pain related to knee osteoarthritis after occlusion of neovessels, allowing the&#xD;
      reduction of antalgic drug consumption, improving the quality of life of patients of this&#xD;
      pathology, delay the need for prosthetic surgery.&#xD;

    <description>KOOS questionnaire assess changes from month to month induced by treatment. KOOS consists of 5 subscales; Pain, other Symptoms, Function in daily living (ADL), Function in sport and recreation (Sport/Rec) and knee related Quality of life (QOL). The previous week is the time period considered when answering the questions. Standardized answer options are given (5 Likert boxes) and each question is assigned a score from 0 to 4. A normalized score (100 indicating no symptoms and 0 indicating extreme symptoms) is calculated for each subscale</description>

    <description>EQ-5D questionnaire is a standardized instrument developed by the EuroQol Group as a measure of health-related quality of life that can be used in a wide range of health conditions and treatments. The EQ-5D consists of a descriptive system and the EQ VAS.&#xD;
The descriptive system comprises five dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression. The EQ VAS records the patient's self-rated health on a vertical visual analogue scale.</description>
