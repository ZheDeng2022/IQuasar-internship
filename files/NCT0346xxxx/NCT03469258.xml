  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research study is evaluating a study drug to treat pancreatic exocrine insufficiency&#xD;
      (PEI) during the first year after the diagnosis of pancreatic cancer while the participant is&#xD;
      recovering from surgery and receiving adjuvant treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study drug involved in this study is:&#xD;
&#xD;
      -Zenpep&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has approved Zenpep as a treatment option for&#xD;
      PEI. Zenpep is a combination of three enzymes (proteins). These enzymes are normally produced&#xD;
      by the pancreas and are important in the digestion of fats, proteins, and sugars. Zenpep is&#xD;
      used to replace these enzymes when the body does not have enough of its own as a result of&#xD;
      surgery and/or pancreatic cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this research study, the investigators are studying whether Zenpep will improve the&#xD;
      ability of patients to complete adjuvant treatment for their pancreatic cancer after surgery&#xD;
      to remove their tumor. The investigators are also studying if Zenpep will have an effect on&#xD;
      nutrition status and quality of life for pancreatic cancer patients after they have had&#xD;
      surgery to remove their tumor.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants must have histologically or cytologically confirmed pancreatic ductal&#xD;
             adenocarcinoma. Variants or mixed histology will be included if the predominant&#xD;
             histology is adenocarcinoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants must have potentially resectable pancreatic cancer defined as: (1) no&#xD;
             detectable metastases (2) signed consent for attempted resection of pancreatic cancer&#xD;
             per treating surgeon.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  ECOG performance status ≤2.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age &gt;18 years. Participants &lt;18 years old are excluded from this study because&#xD;
             subsequent adjuvant therapy is based on therapy guidelines in the adult population.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Willingness to consider adjuvant therapy following surgical resection of disease,&#xD;
             signed in the consent form attestation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ability to understand and willingness to provide written informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pre-operative laboratory values adequate to undergo resection of pancreatic cancer, as&#xD;
             defined below:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Hemoglobin &gt; 7.0 g/dL;&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Platelets ≥ 40,000/mL;&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Creatinine &lt; 2.5 mg/dL or; Creatinine clearance ≥ 20 mL/min/1.73 m2 for&#xD;
                  participants with creatinine levels above institutional normal.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pancreatic resection not performed. Intraoperative findings and unforeseen medical&#xD;
             exigent circumstances may preclude pancreatic resection. Such outcomes include&#xD;
             undetected metastases or vascular involvement, which preclude resection with intent to&#xD;
             cure, as well as perioperative medical events including cardiopulmonary complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Final pathology other than pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma or primary component other&#xD;
             than adenocarcinoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any prior chemotherapy and/or radiation for pancreatic cancer at the time of study&#xD;
             enrollment, including neoadjuvant chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Second malignancy with active disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of allergic reactions or hypersensitivity attributed to compounds of similar&#xD;
             chemical or biologic composition to pancrelipase&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because subsequent adjuvant therapy needed&#xD;
             for the primary endpoint is teratogenic. Pancrelipase is category C. Animal&#xD;
             reproduction studies have not been conducted on pancrelipase and minimal data is&#xD;
             available.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants unable to self-administer pancrelipase.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, symptomatic&#xD;
             congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric&#xD;
             illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants who are receiving any other investigational agents.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participant unable to tolerate oral nutrition.&#xD;
