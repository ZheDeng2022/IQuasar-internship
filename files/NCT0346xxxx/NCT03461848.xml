      The Children and Young People's Health Partnership (CYPHP) Evelina London model is an&#xD;
      innovative, evidence-based approach to reshaping healthcare services in Southwark and&#xD;
      Lambeth. The model of care is a complex health services public health intervention aiming to&#xD;
      integrate care across organisational and professional boundaries. There is a major focus on&#xD;
      improving front line care for all children and young people, and comprehensive proactive care&#xD;
      for those with common and long-term conditions such as asthma, epilepsy, eczema, and&#xD;
      constipation&#xD;
&#xD;
      CYPHP Evelina London model of care is being adopted by the Clinical Commissioning Groups of&#xD;
      Southwark and Lambeth as part of routine care. Early roll out of the model has already&#xD;
      started. However, due to resource limitations, implementation will occur in phases. In the&#xD;
      first phase (~two years), half of GP practices in the Lambeth and Southwark area will&#xD;
      implement the full model while others will offer enhanced usual care (EUC). The evaluation&#xD;
      team will utilize this staged CCG roll out to evaluate the programme using a cluster&#xD;
      randomised controlled trial design. It is expected that all the EUC practices will also adopt&#xD;
      the CYPHP model within the next three years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The impact of the CYPHP Evelina London model will be assessed at two levels; at the&#xD;
      population level (&quot;Population evaluation&quot;) and among CYP with specific conditions (&quot;Tracer&#xD;
      condition evaluation&quot;). The tracer condition evaluation will with consent, follow up CYP with&#xD;
      tracer conditions (asthma, epilepsy, eczema, constipation) to assess the impact of the new&#xD;
      model of care on health service use, quality of care, and child health measures including&#xD;
      health-related quality of life. Cost-effectiveness will be assessed for population and tracer&#xD;
      conditions.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The UK lags behind other high-income countries in several measures of child health, including&#xD;
      mortality (Wolfe et al, 2013). The UK position relative to comparable European countries is&#xD;
      poor in many regards, including higher all-cause mortality, especially for infants and&#xD;
      adolescents, and a slower decline in non-communicable disease mortality (Viner and Wolfe 2018&#xD;
      (in press)). Approximately 20% of childhood deaths are thought to be preventable, with higher&#xD;
      proportions in specific categories such as CYP with chronic conditions (Fraser et al, 2014).&#xD;
      The current models of healthcare provision for children and young people in the UK do not&#xD;
      consistently provide optimum healthcare for CYP, for example are not adequately responsive to&#xD;
      the epidemiological transition towards long term conditions (LTCs) (Wolfe et al, 2011; Royal&#xD;
      College of Paediatrics and Child Health, 2015). Between 60 and 70% of children who died in&#xD;
      the UK between 2001 and 2010 had a chronic condition requiring frequent contact with the&#xD;
      health system (Gilbert, 2015). Chronic, non-communicable disease accounts for 79% of all&#xD;
      disability adjusted life years lost (DALYS), among young people aged 1-14 years, across&#xD;
      Europe, with respiratory diseases (mainly asthma) and neuropsychiatric disorders including&#xD;
      anxiety and depression, among the most common causes of morbidity (Wolfe et al, 2013). The&#xD;
      current UK model of hospital-centred paediatric care was developed to deliver acute inpatient&#xD;
      and high intensity specialist services rather than high quality care for CYP with long term&#xD;
      conditions (LTCs) who need multidisciplinary, coordinated and planned care to prevent illness&#xD;
      and disease complications and to maximize wellbeing and developmental potential (Mansfield,&#xD;
      2013). The current healthcare model, in the context of the wider health and social care&#xD;
      system in the UK, has resulted in suboptimal health outcomes for both acute and chronic&#xD;
      illness (Wolfe et al, 2011). Finally, the current service is not as responsive to families'&#xD;
      needs as it should be, and is often inefficient with a reliance on high-cost emergency&#xD;
      department attendance and acute admissions (Wolfe et al, 2013; Mansfield, 2013). The boroughs&#xD;
      of Lambeth and Southwark have higher than national average rates of infant and child&#xD;
      mortality, variable and sometimes poor outcomes for acute care and planned care for&#xD;
      conditions including asthma, epilepsy, and mental health disorders. There are high and rising&#xD;
      A&amp;E attendance rates for children, emergency hospital admissions, and hospital outpatient&#xD;
      use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As described in the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health's Facing the Future:&#xD;
      Together for Child Health report (Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health 2015), there&#xD;
      is an urgent need to develop new evidence based, cost effective and sustainable health care&#xD;
      services to meet the increasing demands caused by the rising prevalence of chronic illness&#xD;
      across the life course (Wolfe et al, 2013; Davies, 2012; European commission health and&#xD;
      consumers directorate-general, 2014). Countries that have developed health service models&#xD;
      with greater continuity between primary and secondary care, delivered by teams with stronger&#xD;
      incentives to work together, have better health outcomes (Wolfe et al, 2013). A systematic&#xD;
      review of international peer-reviewed published evidence conducted by the CYPHP team showed&#xD;
      that integrated primary and secondary chronic care models can be beneficial on patient&#xD;
      experience and health outcomes, and can be cost saving (Wolfe et al, in draft). However, this&#xD;
      review highlighted the lack of high quality evidence in this area to inform service delivery&#xD;
      and commissioning.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The CYPHP Evelina London model is an innovative, evidence-based approach to reshaping&#xD;
      everyday healthcare services through integrating care across four key areas: (1) vertical&#xD;
      integration of care across primary and secondary care; (2) horizontal integration of health,&#xD;
      education, and social care; (3) integration along the life course especially at transition&#xD;
      points; and (4) integration across public health, healthcare, and healthy public policy. A&#xD;
      major focus of the CYPHP Evelina London model is improving front line care for all children&#xD;
      and young people since front line care (primary care and accident and emergency) is where the&#xD;
      majority of healthcare is delivered, and also acts as the gateway to other services. Front&#xD;
      line care can therefore be an enabler or barrier for the rest of the system to function well.&#xD;
      In particular, effective and efficient urgent care is important to ensure that sufficient&#xD;
      resources are available for the planned proactive comprehensive care that children with&#xD;
      long-term conditions need.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The CYPHP Evelina London model of care was co-produced by local Clinical Commissioning Groups&#xD;
      (CCG's) and Primary and Secondary Healthcare Providers using the best available evidence and&#xD;
      extensive consultation with local children, young people, and families. The Partnership of&#xD;
      CCGs and Providers, with support of local families, wish to implement the model across the&#xD;
      London boroughs of Lambeth and Southwark. Components of the model have been piloted in the&#xD;
      area to test feasibility and acceptability. However, there is a lack of comprehensive&#xD;
      rigorous evidence about integrated models of care for CYP. This evaluation is designed to&#xD;
      help fill that evidence gap, and determine the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of the&#xD;
      new model of care. The evaluation, embedded within the cluster randomised rollout of the&#xD;
      model, aims to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the impact of the Children and Young People's Health Partnership (CYPHP)&#xD;
           Evelina London model of care on the health, healthcare, and health service use of&#xD;
           children and young people (CYP).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To understand how and why the CYPHP Evelina London model of care was effective or&#xD;
           ineffective, and to identify contextually relevant strategies for successful&#xD;
           implementation as well as practical difficulties in adoption, delivery, and maintenance&#xD;
           to inform wider implementation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the costs of delivery and cost effectiveness of the CYPHP Evelina Model of&#xD;
           care compared to enhanced usual care.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To generate rigorous evidence for local, national, and international service providers&#xD;
           and commissioners, and contribute to the evidence base in CYP health services research.&#xD;
