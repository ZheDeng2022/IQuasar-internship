  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The current project seeks to explore the use of emergent biosensor technology to detect&#xD;
      opioid use. The investigators goal is to recruit 60 opioid naïve patients presenting at the&#xD;
      College of Dentistry at UTHSC. Candidate participants must be scheduled for an upcoming&#xD;
      dental procedure that will involve subsequent pain management using oral opioid medication.&#xD;
      Participants will be consented prior to any study procedures. All participant information&#xD;
      from this study will be kept strictly confidential (e.g., no individual data will be shared&#xD;
      with the College of Dentistry).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Opioid overdose is a leading cause of accidental death in the USA, with death rates rising&#xD;
      steadily over the last 20 years (CDC, 2015). Of the over 22,000 deaths relating to&#xD;
      pharmaceutical overdose in 2011, three quarters involved opioid analgesics (Fletcher et al.,&#xD;
      2011). Increases in problematic opioid use have paralleled a corresponding increase in drug&#xD;
      treatment admissions (DOHH, 2014). Drug treatment programs currently focus on behavioral and&#xD;
      pharmacologic interventions to sustain abstinence, and success is typically measured by&#xD;
      self-reports or urine drug screening (NIDA, 2016). Both measurement methods are limited by&#xD;
      such factors as recall bias, distortion, and lack of precision (Fishman et al., 2000). A&#xD;
      detection method that accurately detects opioid use as it occurs in real time would provide&#xD;
      several distinct advantages, including the ability to obtain environmental and behavioral&#xD;
      contexts surrounding relapse as well as an opportunity for targeted interventions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The current project seeks to explore the use of emergent biosensor technology to detect&#xD;
      opioid use. The investigators goal is to recruit 60 opioid naïve patients presenting at the&#xD;
      College of Dentistry at UTHSC. Candidate participants must be scheduled for an upcoming&#xD;
      dental procedure that will involve subsequent pain management using oral opioid medication.&#xD;
      Participants will be consented prior to any study procedures. All participant information&#xD;
      from this study will be kept strictly confidential (e.g., no individual data will be shared&#xD;
      with the College of Dentistry).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants who are enrolled will complete baseline questionnaires regarding psychological&#xD;
      and behavioral risks of substance use. Next, participants will be asked to wear the wristband&#xD;
      sensor for 1 day prior to surgery, and up to 30 days post-surgery, or as long as opioid&#xD;
      medication is prescribed. Physiological measurement will be conducted via the Empatica E4&#xD;
      wristband biosensor, which measures electrodermal activity, skin temperature, and locomotion&#xD;
      data. Opioid use will detected through biosensor activity. Participants will be recruited&#xD;
      over a 6 month period, in cohorts of 10. All study procedures will be approved by the UTHSC&#xD;
      IRB.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hilbert transform analyses combined with paired t-tests will be used to compare the biosensor&#xD;
      data: (A) within subjects, before and after administration of opioids; and (B) between&#xD;
      subjects, controlling for hand dominance, gender, and length of prescription.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Results of analyses will be shared with the College of Dentistry, and will subsequently be&#xD;
      disseminated through a peer-reviewed publication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Role of the College of Dentistry:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To refer patients to Karen Derefinko's study team for possible recruitment into the&#xD;
           study prior to the scheduled surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If possible, to allow a research coordinator to consent and interview participants on&#xD;
           site in an available private room.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To provide prescription data (type, dose, and duration) to study team, with signed&#xD;
           participant consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Epigenetics:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Environmental exposures including prescription drugs and drugs of abuse can have a pronounce&#xD;
      effect on the epigenome (Nestler, 2014; Nielsen et al., 2012). There is growing evidence that&#xD;
      use of opioids results in changes in DNA methylation, an important epigenetic modification&#xD;
      that can alter gene expression. Such changes may play a mechanistic role in forming an&#xD;
      &quot;epigenetic memory&quot; of drug exposure and development of dependence (Doehring et al., 2013;&#xD;
      Tuesta &amp; Zhang, 2014). For this study, the coordinator will collect buccal swabs (cheek&#xD;
      epithelial cells) from study subjects at the start of study and at follow up visits. Buccal&#xD;
      cells will be collected non-invasively using the DNA Genotek sample collection kits&#xD;
      (http://www.dnagenotek.com). The investigator will then perform genome-wide DNA methylation&#xD;
      assay using the Illumina Infinium MethylationEPIC array (https://www.illumina.com). The&#xD;
      investigator will evaluate the longitudinal change in the methylome that may be induced by&#xD;
      short-term opioid use.&#xD;

    <description>We will be measuring physiological changes from pre- to post-opioid administration through the Empatica E4 electronic wristband. This device measures 5 physiological parameters:&#xD;
Physical activity through an accelerometer measuring movement on x,y, and z axes.&#xD;
Heart rate measured in beats per minute (BMP)&#xD;
Skin conductance measured in µs (microseconds)&#xD;
Temperature measured in Celsius (°C)&#xD;
Blood volume pulse measured in nm (nanometers)&#xD;

    <description>We will be measuring DNA methylation markers and their changes from pre- to post-opioid administration through Ilumina Infinium methylation EPIC. More specifically, we will be looking at changes in β-values, which are the ratio of (DNA methylation)/(DNA methylation + DNA unmethylation).
