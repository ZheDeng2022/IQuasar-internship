  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      ELVIS Kids is a parallel, open label, randomised controlled trial (RCT) of Hypertonic Saline&#xD;
      (HS) nose drops (~2.6% NaCl) vs. standard care in children &lt;7 years of age with symptoms of&#xD;
      an Upper Respiratory Tract Infection (URTI).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will run over ~30 months. Children are recruited prior to, or within 48 hours of&#xD;
      developing URTI symptoms by advertising in areas such as local schools, nurseries, health&#xD;
      centres and workplaces as well as social media. For the purposes of this study an URTI is&#xD;
      defined as: at least two respiratory symptoms (nasal stuffiness, runny nose, cough, sore&#xD;
      throat, or sneezing) OR one respiratory symptoms and at least one systemic symptom (lethargy,&#xD;
      muscle pain, headache, pyrexia ≥38°C).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Willing parents/guardians, of children &lt;7 years of age, will be directed by the study&#xD;
      advertising to contact the research team at the Children's Clinical Research Facility (CCRF)&#xD;
      if they are interested in participating. Children will be randomised to either a Control arm&#xD;
      of standard symptomatic care, or an Intervention arm of 3 drops each nostril of HS at least 4&#xD;
      times a day until 24 hours after asymptomatic or maximum of 28 days. All participants will be&#xD;
      requested to obtain a mid-turbinate nasal swab prior to first nasal HS drops (repeated daily&#xD;
      for 5 days), a daily symptom diary (CARIFS, a valid illness measure in the UK), and an end of&#xD;
      illness questionnaire (healthcare use, adverse events, acceptability, infection in household&#xD;
      contacts, parental time taken off usual activities). Parent/guardian of the children&#xD;
      allocated to the intervention arm will be taught how to prepare the HS. Parent/guardian of&#xD;
      children who are asymptomatic at recruitment are requested to inform CCRF when the child&#xD;
      develops an URTI (within 48 hours) and follow the instructions already provided to them when&#xD;
      given the go-ahead to start the trial. On day 28, parents/guardians will be contacted to&#xD;
      determine if their child suffered from wheeze either during the illness or at any point until&#xD;
      day 28. Participation in the study will end on day 28.&#xD;
