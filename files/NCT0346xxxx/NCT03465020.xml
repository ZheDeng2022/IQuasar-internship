  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of the study is to produce a dynamic picture of the adult ITP natural history&#xD;
      and management in Italy by collecting standardized information retrospective and prospective&#xD;
      data of patients in active management through a nation-wide registry.&#xD;

      Primary immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) is an acquired autoimmune disorder affecting both&#xD;
      children and adults, characterized by a platelet count below 100 x 109/L in the absence of&#xD;
      any underlying disease explaining the thrombocytopenia. Clinical manifestations may be absent&#xD;
      or include cutaneous mucosal or organ bleeding, resulting in an overall mortality rate of&#xD;
      less than 1-2%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Previously, 'acute ITP' was used to describe a self-limited form of the disease and 'chronic&#xD;
      ITP' to describe the disease if it lasted for more than 6 months. In 2009, a new terminology&#xD;
      for ITP was agreed upon based on the duration of the disease. The new terms for ITP are:&#xD;
      'newly diagnosed ITP (from diagnosis to 3 months), 'persistent ITP' (3-12 months) and&#xD;
      'chronic ITP' (lasting for more than 12 months) [2].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Chronic primary ITP in adults is slightly more common in women of childbearing age but the&#xD;
      sex incidence is similar in patients over 60. The incidence of ITP in adults is around 4 per&#xD;
      100.000 people per year, with a UK prevalence of up to 24 per 100.000 people [4-6]. No more&#xD;
      than 2 per 100.000 will require ITP treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bleeding is highly variable and there is great heterogeneity. Bleeding is most commonly&#xD;
      mucocutaneous, involving the skin and subcutaneous tissue (petechiae, ecchymoses,&#xD;
      subcutaneous hematomas), the external mucosae (epistaxis, gum bleeding, blood blisters in the&#xD;
      mouth), muscles (muscle hematomata) or the various organs and internal mucosae (hematuria,&#xD;
      gastrointestinal bleeding, menorrhagia, intracerebral bleeding). Major bleeding is not common&#xD;
      if the platelet count is above 30x109/L. Intracranial hemorrhage is rare and is most often&#xD;
      seen in older patients who have additional comorbidities and in patients who fail to respond&#xD;
      to therapy. The yearly risk of fatal hemorrhage is around 1.6-3.9% in unresponsive patients.&#xD;
      This risk varies with age, from 0.4% per year in patients below 40 years old to 13% per year&#xD;
      in those over 60. The natural history of ITP with currently available treatments is not well&#xD;
      known. Available data are mostly based on the era when rituximab and thrombopoietin-receptor&#xD;
      agonists (TPO-RA) were not in use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is a lack reliable data on how recent treatments have modified the course of the&#xD;
      disease. Bleeding frequency and severity, complications like infections, thrombosis,&#xD;
      ITP-related symptoms like fatigue, etc. are also largely unknown as are women's related&#xD;
      issues. Similarly, the cost of treatment for a patient with ITP is not available. Safety and&#xD;
      efficacy of specific recent treatments have been measured mostly in industry-sponsored&#xD;
      studies. Furthermore, most studies did not conform to the International Working Group (IWG)&#xD;
      on ITP recommendations concerning terminology, definitions, outcome criteria and assessment&#xD;
      of bleeding.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To the investigator's knowledge, an ITP Registry is ongoing in UK and in Australia and&#xD;
      registries are being planned in other European countries with a prospective of creating an&#xD;
      international network. The only established international registry, the ITP PARC study, is&#xD;
      operative since 2004 but covers different aspects of the disease. The few Italian registries&#xD;
      are of regional dimension and are not aligned to collect standardized information in a&#xD;
      uniform way.&#xD;
