  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Many youth with chronic disease have difficulty taking medication every day and therefore do&#xD;
      not receive full benefit from treatment. Sickle Cell Disease (SCD) is an inherited blood&#xD;
      disease that affects African Americans and other underserved communities. Hydroxyurea (HU) is&#xD;
      the sole FDA-approved drug therapy for SCD and is highly effective and improves quality of&#xD;
      life. The proposed study, a 5-site four-year randomized control trial (RCT), builds upon the&#xD;
      investigators' recent feasibility study of the same title. Overall goals are reducing&#xD;
      barriers to HU use and improving adherence for youth 10-18 years through creation of a daily&#xD;
      medication habit. The goal of the proposed multi-site study is to test the efficacy of the&#xD;
      HABIT intervention at 6 months and sustainability of the effect at 12 months.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Barriers to medication adherence are common in youth with chronic illness and are a source of&#xD;
      racial/ethnic disparities in underserved communities. An inherited blood disease, Sickle Cell&#xD;
      Disease (SCD) is characterized by chronic and acute illness and reduced quality of life&#xD;
      (QOL). It affects African Americans and other underserved communities. Hydroxyurea (HU) is&#xD;
      the sole FDA-approved drug therapy for SCD and is highly effective and improves QOL. Poor&#xD;
      adherence is common among youth and young adults with SCD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The importance of poor medication adherence, use of community-based health workers (CHWs) to&#xD;
      bridge the gap between health services and underserved parent-youth dyads affected by SCD,&#xD;
      the strength of the science, the success of the investigators' multi-ethnic feasibility&#xD;
      study, and the potential application of study findings to youth with other serious chronic&#xD;
      illnesses speak to the importance of this trial.&#xD;
