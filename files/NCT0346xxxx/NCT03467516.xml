  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 2 study in which the efficacy of a non-myeloablative lymphodepleting&#xD;
      preparative regimen followed by infusion of autologous TIL and high-dose aldesleukin in&#xD;
      patients with metastatic uveal melanoma will be evaluated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Metastatic uveal melanoma (UM) carries a poor prognosis with estimated survival of 4-6&#xD;
      months. There are no known effective systemic therapies. Metastatic UM is classified as an&#xD;
      &quot;orphan&quot; disease and there are currently few clinical trial options for these patients. Thus,&#xD;
      novel systemic approaches are desperately needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A recent pilot study has found that administration of autologous tumor infiltrating&#xD;
      lymphocytes (TIL) generated from resected metastases can induce objective tumor response and&#xD;
      durable complete response in metastatic uveal melanoma patients. These encouraging results&#xD;
      require confirmation to determine if this immunotherapy is of future benefit in treating this&#xD;
      disease.&#xD;

      STUDY DESIGN&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Phase 2 study will be conducted in conjunction with companion protocol (Cell Harvest and&#xD;
      Preparation to Support Adoptive Cell Therapy Clinical Protocols and Pre-Clinical Studies) as&#xD;
      described below:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cell Preparation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with evaluable metastatic uveal melanoma who have lesions that can be resected with&#xD;
      minimum morbidity will undergo resection of tumor. TIL will be obtained while enrolled on the&#xD;
      companion protocol (Cell Harvest and Preparation to Support Adoptive Cell Therapy Clinical&#xD;
      Protocols and Pre-Clinical Studies). Separate tumor procurements may be performed under a&#xD;
      protocol to obtain TIL if initial tumor procurements could not successfully generate TIL. The&#xD;
      TIL will be grown and expanded for this trial according to standard operating procedures&#xD;
      submitted in the IND. The TIL will be assessed for potency by interferon-gamma release.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment Phase:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once cells exceed the potency requirement and are projected to exceed the minimum number&#xD;
      specified in the COA, the patient will be registered on this study and receive the lymphocyte&#xD;
      depleting preparative regimen consisting of fludarabine and cyclophosphamide, followed by&#xD;
      infusion of up to 2x10^11 lymphocytes (minimum of 1x10^9 cells) and administration of&#xD;
      high-dose intravenous aldesleukin. It is anticipated that TIL that meet the COA will not be&#xD;
      achievable in approximately 20% of patients who undergo resection. These patients may undergo&#xD;
      a second resection to grow TIL, if another suitable lesion exists. Approximately 6 weeks (+/-&#xD;
      2 weeks) after TIL administration, patients will undergo a complete tumor evaluation and&#xD;
      evaluation of toxicity and immunologic parameters. Patients will receive one course of&#xD;
      treatment. The start date of the course will be the start date of the chemotherapy; the end&#xD;
      date will be the day of the first post-treatment evaluation. Patients may undergo a second&#xD;
      treatment. Patients will receive no other experimental agents while on this protocol.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>The Phase 2 study will follow the Simon's optimal two-stage design. Fifteen patients will be included in the first stage; if there are 1 or fewer patients responding to therapy the trial will be terminated. If at least 2 responses are observed, expansion into Stage 2 to a total of 47 patients will occur. If at least 6 patients respond to therapy, the study therapy would be considered to have met its primary study goal.</intervention_model_description>
