  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether levotofisopam is safe and effective in the&#xD;
      treatment of hyperuricemia and gout.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary objectives of this study are (1) to evaluate the safety and tolerability of&#xD;
      levotofisopam in patients with hyperuricemia and gout, and (2) to evaluate the effect of&#xD;
