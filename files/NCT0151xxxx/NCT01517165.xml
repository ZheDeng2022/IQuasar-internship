      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Opioid-withdrawal symptoms include runny nose, body aches, chills, sweating, and&#xD;
           diarrhea. Many people have these symptoms when trying to stop using opioid drugs.&#xD;
           Long-acting opioids like methadone and buprenorphine are used to help people stop using&#xD;
           other opioids, but these drugs can cause the same withdrawal symptoms. There are no&#xD;
           non-opioid drugs that are approved specifically to treat those symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pioglitazone is a drug used to treat type 2 diabetes. In a research study, the drug&#xD;
           allowed heroin users to decrease their methadone dose faster without much discomfort,&#xD;
           and stay abstinent from heroin. Researchers want to learn more about how pioglitazone&#xD;
           helps treat opioid withdrawal symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To test whether pioglitazone can reduce opioid withdrawal symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Individuals between 18 and 65 years of age who will be using buprenorphine to treat opioid&#xD;
      dependency.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  This study will last up to 17 weeks. Participants must come to the study clinic every&#xD;
           day for at least 13 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be screened with a physical exam and medical history. They will also&#xD;
           answer questions about drug use habits, and provide blood and urine samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will take buprenorphine daily for 7 weeks. For the first 3 weeks, the dose&#xD;
           will be increased to a level that should help stop the use of opioids. For the next 4&#xD;
           weeks, the dose will be decreased. Blood, urine, and breath samples will be collected at&#xD;
           different study visits. Participants will also fill out questionnaires about mood, drug&#xD;
           craving, and withdrawal symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  After 1 week on buprenorphine, participants will start the study pill (pioglitazone or a&#xD;
           placebo) every day. They will take the study pill for 13 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  During the treatment period, participants will have drug counseling once a week for 30&#xD;
           minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Some participants have other tests as part of this study. These tests include functional&#xD;
           magnetic resonance imaging scans to look for changes in brain activity and giving&#xD;
           samples of cerebrospinal fluid to study brain chemistry.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will have a final followup phone call 3 weeks after the last clinic visit.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Some individuals successfully maintained on buprenorphine or methadone are appropriate&#xD;
      candidates for dose tapering and transition to medication-free follow-up care. For such&#xD;
      individuals, the physical discomfort of the dose taper can be a barrier to a successful&#xD;
      transition. Recent data suggest a novel approach: the FDA-approved diabetes medication&#xD;
      pioglitazone (Actos), which activates the gamma (g) subtype of&#xD;
      peroxisome-proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs). Pioglitazone acts not only in peripheral&#xD;
      tissue, but also in brain regions associated with drug tolerance and withdrawal. In animal&#xD;
      models, pioglitazone prevents signs of opioid withdrawal. In a small, preliminary open-label&#xD;
      clinical study, opioid-maintained outpatients given pioglitazone were remarkably successful&#xD;
      in transitioning comfortably to a medication-free state, after prior unsuccessful attempts&#xD;
      without pioglitazone. These initial data provide proof of principle and indicate that&#xD;
      pioglitazone merits evaluation in a randomized-controlled study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Scientific goals:&#xD;
&#xD;
      (1) To determine whether, compared to placebo, pioglitazone increases successful completion&#xD;
      of an opioid agonist/antagonist taper in patients who are physically dependent on opioids.&#xD;
      (2) To determine the neural mechanisms by which such an effect may occur.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participant population:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of up to 120 opioid-dependent participants (80 evaluable) will be enrolled. Evaluable&#xD;
      participants are defined as those who are randomized to one of the two main experimental&#xD;
      groups (pioglitazone or placebo). Target enrollment will include 25% women and 70% minorities&#xD;
      (mostly African-American).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experimental design and methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be a randomized, double-blind clinical trial with two treatment groups (40 per&#xD;
      group): pioglitazone (45 mg oral daily) and placebo. The study will last up to 10 weeks. All&#xD;
      participants will receive 27 days of buprenorphine/naloxone (referred to hereinafter as&#xD;
      buprenorphine) - 14 days of stabilization and a 13-day taper. Pioglitazone/placebo will be&#xD;
      initiated in week 2 and continue for 5 weeks (3 weeks concurrently with buprenorphine and 2&#xD;
      weeks without). Participants will have two follow-up assessments: a clinic visit (week 7 or&#xD;
      one week post-pioglitazone/placebo) and a phone follow-up (week 10 or 4 weeks&#xD;
      post-pioglitazone/placebo). Participation will be conducted as a combination of outpatient&#xD;
      and inpatient portions: first two weeks (pre-buprenorphine taper) as outpatients; 18 days on&#xD;
      an inpatient unit (JHBC CRU) during and for approximately 5 days after the buprenorphine&#xD;
      taper; and 10 daily visits and two follow-up visits outpatient. Throughout the study,&#xD;
      participants will receive weekly individual counseling, including case management to prepare&#xD;
      for post-study treatment. Data on opiate-withdrawal symptoms and craving will be collected&#xD;
      daily. Data on self-reported drug use, with urine specimens for drug testing, will be&#xD;
      collected three times weekly. A subset of participants will undergo functional&#xD;
      magnetic-resonance imaging (fMRI) and magnetic-resonance spectroscopy (MRS): one training&#xD;
      session in the mock scanner and two scanning sessions that will occur at the end of the first&#xD;
      week of buprenorphine and during the second week of the buprenorphine taper. Another subset&#xD;
      of participants (largely overlapping with the subset who undergo fMRI/MRS) will undergo one&#xD;
      lumbar puncture so that we can measure levels of neurotransmitters, metabolites, and&#xD;
      proinflammatory cytokines in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). At the lumbar-puncture visit, blood&#xD;
      will also be drawn so that we can compare analyte levels in CSF and blood. At the end of the&#xD;
      study, all participants will be offered assistance to transfer to another treatment program,&#xD;
      either drug-free treatment or opioid-agonist treatment (OAT). The primary outcome measures&#xD;
      will be opioid-withdrawal severity as measured on the SOWs and COWs. Secondary outcome&#xD;
      measures will include overall proportions of opioid-negative urines, proportions of&#xD;
      participants needing adjunct medications, time to resumption of opioid use following&#xD;
      discharge from the residential unit, status at follow-up, and (in the subset of participants&#xD;
      who agree to undergo lumbar puncture) CSF levels (and corresponding blood levels) of&#xD;
      proinflammatory cytokines and other analytes, which we hypothesize will predict outcome and&#xD;
      thereby clarify pioglitazone s mechanism of action. In the subset of participants who agree&#xD;
      to undergo fMRI/MRS and lumbar puncture, we will attempt to determine the neural mediators of&#xD;
      pioglitazone s therapeutic effects, or (if pioglitazone is not effective) to determine&#xD;
      predictors of treatment outcome. Post-treatment outcome measures are expected to be affected&#xD;
      only indirectly by pioglitazone; we anticipate that pioglitazone will reduce withdrawal&#xD;
      symptoms, enhance initial abstinence during the buprenorphine taper, and address possible&#xD;
      protracted withdrawal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Benefits to participants and/or society:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will receive buprenorphine taper and drug counseling. There may be incidental&#xD;
      benefits from the buprenorphine and counseling, because they are likely to reduce&#xD;
      participants' use of opioids and risk of infectious diseases such as HIV or hepatitis B and&#xD;
      C.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Risks to participants:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants may experience side effects from pioglitazone and/or buprenorphine/naloxone and&#xD;
      are likely to experience some discomfort from opioid withdrawal. The subset of participants&#xD;
      who agree to undergo lumbar puncture and fMRI/MRS may experience side effects from those&#xD;
      procedures.&#xD;

&#xD;
          8. Body Mass Index (BMI) of 40 or higher&#xD;
&#xD;
        Additional Exclusion Criteria for the fMRI portion of the Study:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion from the MRI component of the study will be based on the criteria outlined below.&#xD;
        Participants who do not qualify or who do not agree to participate in the fMRI portion of&#xD;
        the study will not be excluded from the main study. Exclusion criteria will be assessed&#xD;
        during screening under NIDA-IRP screening protocol 06-DA-N415. Participants will be&#xD;
        excluded from the fMRI portion of the study if they:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. are left handed. Justification: Some of the neural processes assessed in this protocol&#xD;
             may be lateralized in the brain. In order to reduce potential variance, participants&#xD;
             will be required to be right-handed. Assessment tool(s): Edinburgh Handedness&#xD;
             Inventory.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. over the age of 55 years. Justification: Many cognitive processes change with age. In&#xD;
             addition, the likelihood of difficult-to-detect medical abnormalities such as silent&#xD;
             cerebral infarcts increases with age. Therefore, older individuals, defined as those&#xD;
             over 55, will be&#xD;
&#xD;
             excluded from the present study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. have certain implanted devices (cardiac pacemaker or neurostimulator, some artificial&#xD;
             joints, metal pins, surgical clips or other implanted metal parts), body morphology,&#xD;
             or claustrophobia. Justification: Implanted devices may increase the risk of MRI&#xD;
             scanning and/or adversely affect the quality of the data; body morphology may prevent&#xD;
             optimal positioning in the scanner and thus affect the quality of the data;&#xD;
             participants with claustrophobia may find the MRI scan too unpleasant and may exhibit&#xD;
             excess movement that will adversely affect the quality of the data. Assessment&#xD;
             tool(s): Prospective participants will fill out an MRI screening questionnaire and&#xD;
             undergo an interview with an MR technologist. Questions concerning suitability for&#xD;
             scanning will be referred to the MR Medical Advisory Investigator. Prospective&#xD;
             participants will be questioned about symptoms of claustrophobia and placed in the&#xD;
             mock scanner during their first visit to assess for possible difficulty tolerating the&#xD;
             confinement of the scanner and for ability to fit into the scanner.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. have conditions restricting their ability to lie flat for several hours (such as&#xD;
             coagulopathies, superficial or deep vein thrombosis, or musculoskeletal&#xD;
             abnormalities). Justification: MR scanning sessions require participants to lie flat&#xD;
             on their backs and remain perfectly still for approximately two hours. Therefore,&#xD;
             conditions that would make that difficult (e.g. chronic back pain, significant&#xD;
             scoliosis) or dangerous (e.g. familial hypercoagulability syndrome, history of&#xD;
             thrombosis) will be exclusionary. Assessment tool(s): History and physical examination&#xD;
             by a qualified IRP clinician, supplemented with a trial of lying in the mock scanner&#xD;
             to assess comfort.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. are cognitively impaired or learning disabled. Justification: Cognitive impairment and&#xD;
             learning disabilities may be associated with altered brain functioning in regions&#xD;
             recruited during laboratory task performance. Assessment tool(s): History of placement&#xD;
             in special education classes as a consequence of serious learning problems and not&#xD;
             solely as a consequence of behavioral problems, assessed during the History and&#xD;
             Physical screening assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. have HIV or Syphilis. Justification: HIV and syphilis can each have CNS sequelae,&#xD;
             introducing unnecessary variability into the data. Assessment tool(s): Oral HIV&#xD;
             followed by blood test if oral test is + and Syphilis Treponemal Test (STT) without&#xD;
             history of adequate treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. regularly use any medications that would alter CNS function, cardiovascular function,&#xD;
             or neuronal-vascular coupling. This includes prescription medications (e.g.,&#xD;
             antidepressants, benzodiazepines, antipsychotics, anticonvulsants, barbiturates),&#xD;
             over-the-counter medications (e.g., cold medicine), or herbal medications (e.g., Kava,&#xD;
             Gingko biloba, St. John s wort). The only exceptions are the study medications.&#xD;
             Justification: The use of these substances may alter the fMRI signal and/or neural&#xD;
             functions of interest. Assessment tool(s): History and comprehensive urine drug&#xD;
             screening to detect antidepressants, benzodiazepines, antipsychotics, anticonvulsants,&#xD;
             and barbiturates.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. have any current or prior neurological illnesses including, but not limited to, those&#xD;
             listed in the main exclusion criteria. Justification: Neurological diseases alter CNS&#xD;
             function and, possibly, the neuronal-vascular coupling that forms the basis of the&#xD;
             fMRI signal. Assessment tool(s): History and physical examination by a qualified IRP&#xD;
             clinician, adult ADHD Self-Report Scale, urine drug screening for anticonvulsants not&#xD;
             disclosed by history.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. have any other major medical condition that in the view of the investigators would&#xD;
             compromise the integrity of the data. Justification: Many illness not explicitly&#xD;
             covered here may alter important outcome measures. Assessment tool(s): History and&#xD;
             physical examination by a qualified IRP clinician and CBC, urinalysis, NIDA chemistry&#xD;
             panel (liver function tests, electrolytes, kidney function). Determination of&#xD;
             exclusionary status will be based on laboratory values outlined in Table I for the&#xD;
             main study, but the MAI will retain discretion to exclude participants from the&#xD;
             fMRI/MRS secondary study based on less extreme lab results. After the screening&#xD;
             process has been completed, the MAI will take into account all data collected in order&#xD;
             to decide if there is an existing medical illness that would compromise participation&#xD;
