  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Obesity causes 600 premature deaths per week in the UK and existing treatments are not&#xD;
      effective. When humans eat, the bowels naturally secrete chemicals into the bloodstream which&#xD;
      make people feel full and which stop eating. One of these chemicals is known as Peptide YY&#xD;
      (PYY). The investigators have previously shown that injections of PYY reduce appetite and&#xD;
      food intake in human volunteers. The investigators have now developed a very similar&#xD;
      chemical, Y242, as a treatment for obesity. Y242 has been tested in animals and has been&#xD;
      shown to be safe, to reduce their appetite, and to last for much longer than PYY itself. This&#xD;
      study will test Y242 to ensure that it is well tolerated in humans, and to see how long it&#xD;
      lasts in the blood stream after being injected under the skin. It will also look for any&#xD;
      effects on appetite.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Obesity causes 600 premature deaths per week in the UK and existing treatments are less than&#xD;
      ideal. Intravenous infusion of a hormone called PYY reduces food intake but its effects only&#xD;
      last for a few hours and it can cause nausea. Y242 is a longacting analogue of PYY. Given&#xD;
      subcutaneously in rodents, it has a profile of action of at least 72 hours and strongly&#xD;
      inhibits food intake. It causes weight loss without behavioural effects. With MRC funding,&#xD;
      Y242 has passed Good Laboratory Practice toxicology testing and the present proposal is a&#xD;
      first in human study to investigate its safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics in&#xD;
      overweight but otherwise healthy men.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is a combined single ascending dose (part A) and multiple ascending dose (part B)&#xD;
      Phase 1 investigation. The primary objective is to investigate safety and tolerability. The&#xD;
      secondary objective is to assess Y242's pharmacokinetic (PK) profile. Possible effects on&#xD;
      food consumption will be explored. For part A up to 48 subjects are planned, with up to 40&#xD;
      subjects for part B. In each part subjects are divided into groups, each of which is dosed&#xD;
      with the same level, starting with a single dose (part A) much lower than is expected to&#xD;
      cause an effect. Subjects are admitted to a Unit so they can be closely observed for adverse&#xD;
      effects and safety tests, blood concentrations of the drug and food and liquid intake and&#xD;
      output will be monitored. Subjects are allocated at random (like tossing a coin) to receive&#xD;
      Y242 or placebo (dummy). Safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetic data will be summarised and&#xD;
      available results considered in deciding dose escalation, with stopping rules designed to&#xD;
      enable us to explore the relationship between dose and adverse effect (eg nausea) without&#xD;
      causing unacceptable nausea or other symptoms in the volunteers.&#xD;
