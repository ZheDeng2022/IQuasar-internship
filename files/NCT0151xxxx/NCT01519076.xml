      This study is a prospective trial wherein each included subject will receive the experimental&#xD;
      magnetically enhanced diffusion therapy. It will be conducted on a maximum of ten adult male&#xD;
      or female patients who meet the inclusion and exclusion criteria and informed consent has&#xD;
      been obtained. Subjects presenting in the emergency department with acute ischemic stroke and&#xD;
      are eligible for tPA therapy may be considered for inclusion in the study.&#xD;

      This study is a prospective trial wherein each included subject will receive the experimental&#xD;
      magnetically enhanced diffusion therapy. It will be conducted on a maximum of ten adult male&#xD;

      are eligible for tPA therapy may be considered for inclusion in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects who meet the eligibility criteria will be treated with Magnetically Enhanced&#xD;
      Diffusion (MED) concurrently with tPA infusion. Perfusion will be assessed using CTA/CTP at&#xD;
      2-4 hours upon completion of tPA infusion and using MRI at 24 hours upon completion of tPA&#xD;
      infusion. Subjects are followed at 14 days, 30 days and 90 days post-treatment.&#xD;

    <measure>Safety: incidence and evaluation of any adverse effects associated with the investigational procedure compared with historical controls treated with tPA alone.</measure>
    <time_frame>90 days</time_frame>
    <description>The primary measures of safety will be mortality at 3 months and symptomatic ICH within the first 24 hours post-treatment. All intracerebral hemorrhages (ICH) will be classified radiographically using the ECASS criteria. The proportion of subjects with Type II parenchymal intracerebral hematomas within the first 24 hours post-treatment and the incidence of any asymptomatic hemorrhage within the first 24 hours will also be compared.</description>

    <measure>Brain Recanalization and perfusion</measure>
    <time_frame>24 hours</time_frame>
    <description>The degree of recanalization (partial and complete) and reperfusion will be assessed at 2-4 hours post-treatment using CT angiography, and at 24 +/- 6 hours post-treatment using MRI. TIMI Grade Flow of 2 or 3 will be considered &quot;responsive to treatment&quot;.</description>
