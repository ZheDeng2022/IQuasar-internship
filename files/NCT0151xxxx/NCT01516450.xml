    <textblock>
      This study is an open-label, randomized, 2 parallel group, single dose study in healthy&#xD;
      Japanese males to assess the pharmacokinetics and safety/tolerability of single intravenous&#xD;
      administration and single subcutaneous administration of GSK1550188. Serial blood samples for&#xD;
      the determination of GSK1550188 concentration will be collected and safety assessments will&#xD;
      be performed for each treatment group&#xD;
