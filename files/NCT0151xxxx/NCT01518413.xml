  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the safest and most effective oral dose&#xD;
      combinations of sorafenib and irinotecan in pediatric patients with solid tumors, i.e.&#xD;
      relapsed or refractory.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Sorafenib, a multi-kinase inhibitor of several targets felt to be important in tumor growth&#xD;
      and angiogenesis, has been well studied and shown promising clinical results in adult cancer&#xD;
      patients and the Maximum Tolerated Dose or MTD has been determined in pediatric patients.&#xD;
      Irinotecan is known to be effective and is widely used in pediatric malignancies. The&#xD;
      combination of sorafenib with irinotecan is of interest as these agents have different&#xD;
      mechanisms of action. In addition, the combination has been evaluated in adult patients and&#xD;
      deemed tolerable without alterations in the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile at the MTD. The&#xD;
      trial we are proposing also offers the advantage of being a completely oral regimen, adding&#xD;
      convenience and cost effectiveness. Given these considerations, if the sorafenib/irinotecan&#xD;
      combination proves tolerable in phase I studies and shows efficacy in phase II studies, it&#xD;
      would be an attractive combination to incorporate into existing chemotherapy regimens for&#xD;
      pediatric cancer.&#xD;
