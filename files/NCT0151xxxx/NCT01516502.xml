      Objective: To compare the effectiveness of application of low-level laser therapy (LLLT) to&#xD;
      trigger points and traditional acupoints for patients with cervical myofascial pain syndrome&#xD;
      (MPS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: A single-blinded, randomized, placebo-controlled trial Setting: University&#xD;
      rehabilitation hospital Participants: One hundred and twenty one patients with cervical MPS&#xD;
      Intervention: The investigators performed this experiment using low level 810-nm gallium&#xD;
      aluminum arsenide (Ga-Al-As) laser. One hundred participants were randomly assigned to four&#xD;
      treatment groups, including (1) acupoint therapy (2) acupoint control (3) trigger point&#xD;
      therapy and (4) trigger point control groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main Outcome measures: The investigators evaluated the patient's visual analogue scale (VAS)&#xD;
      pain scores, pressure pain threshold and cervical range of motion (ROM) before and after the&#xD;
      therapy.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Low level laser therapy (LLLT) has been promoted since 1960s. It was clinically applied on&#xD;
      neurological, musculoskeletal and soft tissue disorders, with the effects such as&#xD;
      acceleration of wound healing, edema reduction in human flexor tendon injuries, improvement&#xD;
      of morning stiffness, and pain relief in rheumatoid arthritis and lateral epicondylitis. As&#xD;
      for relief of musculoskeletal pain, however, the effect of LLLT is controversial. Some&#xD;
      studies reported that LLLT was a safe and effective treatment for relief of musculoskeletal&#xD;
      pain, while others considered LLLT as ineffective in treating certain musculoskeletal&#xD;
      diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      LLLT has been used to stimulate traditional acupoints, which is denoted as laser acupuncture.&#xD;
      In addition to pain relief, laser acupuncture has been reported to be effective in a variety&#xD;
      of disorders such as intractable hiccups,enuresis, as well as weight reduction. Nevertheless,&#xD;
      the underlying mechanisms and modes of application of laser acupuncture remain unclear.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There has been evidence that needle acupuncture on traditional acupoints or trigger points&#xD;
      may ease neck pain. However, needle acupuncture has some limitations because it is an&#xD;
      invasive procedure with risk of infection or pneumothorax. Besides, some patients were not&#xD;
      able to tolerate the discomfort from needle manipulation during acupuncture therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      LLLT is a type of non-invasive painless therapy and hence a good alternative to needle&#xD;
      acupuncture. LLLT has been used to treat neck pain since 1981 and demonstrated significant&#xD;
      reduction of pain intensity and improvement of cervical range of motion (ROM) in patients&#xD;
      with cervical myofascial pain syndrome (MPS). In most of the studies on LLLT and cervical&#xD;
      MPS, trigger points were chosen as the application area domain for LLLT. However, there is no&#xD;
      report yet to compare the effectiveness of LLLT on trigger points and traditional acupoints.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the present single-blinded, randomized, controlled study, the investigators aimed to&#xD;
      investigate the effectiveness of application of LLLT to the trigger points and traditional&#xD;
      acupoints in patients with cervical MPS. The outcome measurement was pain relief and the&#xD;
      improvement of cervical ROM, on which the findings could provide in-depth understanding of&#xD;
      the therapeutic mechanism of LLLT and further allow more flexible options of clinical&#xD;
      application.&#xD;
