      Strictures in the bile duct cause a blockage of flow of bile. This leads to potential&#xD;
      problems including jaundice, itch and infection in the bile duct. The usual first step in&#xD;
      this situation would be to allow flow of bile by placing a stent across the stricture. This&#xD;
      is usually done by a special type of endoscopy procedure called an endoscopic retrograde&#xD;
      cholangiopancreatography, or ERCP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The most commonly used stent are made from a plastic material called polyethylene and has a&#xD;
      central lumen in which bile drains through it. Health Canada has approved the sale and use of&#xD;
      another stent with a winged perimeter (the VIADUCT stent) for placement in bile duct&#xD;
      strictures and is used routinely in our hospitals. However, the investigators do not know&#xD;
      which stent is better at treating bile duct strictures. In order to determine which stent&#xD;
      would be more useful, the VIADUCT stent and the usual polyethylene flanged stent must be&#xD;
      studied under carefully controlled circumstances. This will be done by a randomized,&#xD;
      subject-blinded study. Other trials in the past have looked at other stents in this way, but&#xD;
      this is the first time the VIADUCT stent has been looked at in this manner. The investigators&#xD;
      suspect that the design of the VIADUCT stent will allow it to work for a longer period of&#xD;
      time compared to the traditional polyethylene stent.&#xD;

      Biliary obstruction usually presents with jaundice, pruritis, cholangitis, and steatorrhoea.&#xD;
      Strictures which are a common cause of biliary obstruction, may be secondary to benign or&#xD;
      malignant conditions. Common benign conditions include chronic pancreatitis, primary&#xD;
      sclerosing cholangitis, autoimmune pancreatitis, prior surgery and recurrent pyogenic&#xD;
      cholangitis. Cholangiocarcinomas, ampullary and pancreatic tumours are more common causes of&#xD;
      malignant biliary obstruction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The principles of managing biliary strictures are to determine the underlying cause of the&#xD;
      stricture, whilst achieving drainage of the biliary tree, initially with the placement of a&#xD;
      plastic stent via an endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP). Strictures are&#xD;
      sampled using biliary brush cytology and/or biliary biopsy to assess for underlying&#xD;
      malignancy. Malignant strictures are usually staged for resectability with computed&#xD;
      tomography (CT), magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) and/or endoscopic&#xD;
      ultrasound (EUS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Viaduct stent (GI Supply, Camp Hill, Pennsylvania, USA) is a unique stent design and has&#xD;
      a winged perimeter, which channels flow of bile around the stent, rather than through a&#xD;
      central lumen. Theoretically this may enhance flow and biliary drainage, and prevent&#xD;
      obstruction. Both polyethylene and Viaduct plastic stents are approved for use by Health&#xD;
      Canada for benign and malignant biliary conditions. It is not known whether one stent is&#xD;
      superior to the other in maintaining symptomatic relief from bile duct strictures as there&#xD;
      have been no studies to date comparing the two stents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is limited published data on the Viaduct stent. A pilot study of the winged stent&#xD;
      design was published in 2006. Five patients had winged stents inserted and followed for 2&#xD;
      weeks. The were no problems with stent insertion and symptoms of obstruction and jaundice&#xD;
      improved over this time. One study published in abstract form retrospectively compared 34&#xD;
      Viaduct stents matched with 240 &quot;conventional&quot; stents over a five year period. There was no&#xD;
      statistical difference with stent dysfunction, and a trend towards patency with the Viaduct&#xD;
      stent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary aim of this study is to compare the stent patency time in the Viaduct and&#xD;
      polyethylene stent groups in subjects with malignant bile duct strictures. The secondary aims&#xD;
      are to determine the etiology of stent failure in the two treatment groups, to identify and&#xD;
      compare device-related adverse events in the two treatment groups, to identify other patient&#xD;
      factors associated with stent failure, and to compare survival between the Viaduct and&#xD;
      polyethylene stent groups.&#xD;
