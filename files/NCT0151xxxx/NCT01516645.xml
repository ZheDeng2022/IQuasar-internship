    <textblock>
      This is a two-part, Phase 1 open label, single-center, dose escalation study of KHK2898 as&#xD;
      monotherapy in subjects with advanced solid tumors who no longer respond to standard therapy&#xD;
      or for whom no standard therapy is available.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will be conducted in two parts. In Part 1, a standard 3+3 designed dose escalation&#xD;
      phase, subjects will receive KHK2898, administered intravenously, once every 2 weeks. A&#xD;
      treatment cycle will consists of total of two doses per cycle. Part 2 of the study will&#xD;
      enroll subjects with squamous cell type tumor to receive KHK2898 at a dose to be determined&#xD;
      following completion of Part 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All subjects will receive study therapy until disease progression, the development of&#xD;
      unacceptable toxicity, noncompliance or withdrawal of consent by the subject, or Investigator&#xD;
      decision, up to a maximum of six cycles (approximately six months). After six cycles of&#xD;
      KHK2898 therapy, the subject may continue to receive the drug after discussion with the&#xD;
      Sponsor and determination that the subject is experiencing a best response of at least stable&#xD;
      disease (SD) and is not experiencing any unacceptable toxicities or dose limiting toxicities&#xD;
      (DLTs).&#xD;
