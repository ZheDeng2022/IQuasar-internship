      Aims of this study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      TNF alpha is believed to have a major role in the pathogenesis of sciatica. The efficacy and&#xD;
      safety of adalimumab versus placebo in the treatment of acute disc prolapse will be will be&#xD;
      compared up to 12 months after the start of study drug treatment. Primary objective of the&#xD;
      study is to evaluate the clinical functionality of the patients with Oswestry Disability&#xD;
      Score and VAS (leg and back pain) at the end of study drug treatment at week 6. Secondary&#xD;
      objectives are to compare the need of operative treatment, sick leave days, pain killer&#xD;
      consumption and quality of life between the two study groups up to 12 months after the start&#xD;
      of study drug treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients and study drug treatment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study population consist of 99 patients with sciatica caused by herniated disc prolapse.&#xD;
      The patients will be randomized to 3 arms: 33 patients to adalimumab 40mg every week, 33&#xD;
      patients to adalimumab 40mg every other week, and 33 patients to placebo. Study drug&#xD;
      treatment period will be six weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study population will be collected from the patient population with severe sciatica&#xD;
      symptoms sent to Spine Unit of Department of Physical and Rehabilitation Medicine in Kuopio&#xD;
      University Hospital. The patient information will be given orally by investigators at the&#xD;
      first visit and also patient information letter will be given. The informed consent will be&#xD;
      signed by the patient and the investigator before any study related procedures. Patient will&#xD;
      receive a copy of the written information and signed informed consent form. The patient has&#xD;
      the right to discontinue his participation at any time without giving any reason.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The randomisation will be made in groups taken in count the level of disc prolapse and and&#xD;
      sex. In emergency cases the randomisation will be opened with the decision of investigator.&#xD;
      Each patient require 8 site visits. At the baseline visit (visit 0) the patient history and&#xD;
      exclusion and inclusion criteria will be checked and MRI will be done. At visit 1 Visual&#xD;
      Analogue Scale, Oswestry disability index and Quality of Life Questionnaire (15-D) and&#xD;
      clinical examination of patients will be carried out. In case the MRI is already available at&#xD;
      baseline visit, the visit can be combined with visit 1. At the follow up visits (1 week, 2&#xD;
      weeks, 4 weeks, 3 months, 6 months and 12 months after the first injection) Visual Analogue&#xD;
      Scale, Oswestry disability index and Quality of Life Questionnaire (15-D), Patients and&#xD;
      Physicians Global Assessments and clinical examination of patients will be carried out and&#xD;
      the Adverse Events are recorded. If the the study medication do not help the sciatica&#xD;
      symptoms enough, disc surgery will be evaluated with decision of investigator and&#xD;
      neurosurgeon or orthopaedic surgeon at visit of 6 weeks. With very severe symptoms and signs,&#xD;
      major neurological signs or intolerable pain the surgery will be evaluated in any phase of&#xD;
      study (see rescue medication).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patient data will be collected to CRF and source data to patient records, where also sick&#xD;
      leave days and the use of pain medication will be collected during each site visit. Patient&#xD;
      medication and history will be collected at visit 1. The Adverse Events will be evaluated at&#xD;
      each visit and recorded to patient records and CRF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is investigator based study and will be carried out on spine center at the&#xD;
      Department of Physical and Rehabilitation Medicine in Kuopio University Hospital. The&#xD;
      laboratory and imaging studies will be carried out in the Departments of Clinical Chemistry&#xD;
      and Radiology. If the surgery is needed the Department of Neurosurgery and Orthopedics will&#xD;
      be asked to work. The Abbott Laboratories Ltd will provide the study medication. Adalimumab&#xD;
      is registered in Finland for Rheumatoid Arthritis. The study medication will be given at the&#xD;
      site visit by investigator. Injections for week 3 and 5 will be administered by the study&#xD;
      subject at home.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Efficacy Assessments:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To confirm the clinical diagnosis of sciatica Magnetic Resonance Imaging using Siemens Avant&#xD;
      1.5 T clinical scanner (Siemens, Erlangen, Germany) will be used. Neural compromise will be&#xD;
      assessed according to the system of Pfirrmann et al. from grade 0 (no compromise, normal) to&#xD;
      Grade 1 (contact), Grade 2 (deviation) and Grade 3 (compression).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjective disability will be measured by the Oswestry Disability Index (0-100%), where 0%&#xD;
      represents no disability and 100 % extreme difficult disability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pain experience will be measured with self-administered visual analogue scale VAS (range&#xD;
      0-100 mm). It has proved to be a valid index of experimental, clinical and chronic pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients and physicians Global Assessment will be used as the clinical evaluation of&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Quality of life will be assessed by Finnish 15-D questionnaire&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety Assessments:&#xD;
&#xD;
      At screening the patients must be evaluated for active and latent TB infections by using PPD&#xD;
      and chest x-ray (if not available from previous 3 months prior to screening) and a detailed&#xD;
      review of the subjects medical history. Also at screening T SPOT-TB test will be taken.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients who receive study drug will be included to the safety analysis. Safety follow-up&#xD;
      will continue until 70 days after the last study drug injection. Safety will be assessed by&#xD;
      AE collection, physical examination, vital signs and laboratory parameters throughout the&#xD;
      study period. Safety laboratory parameters (full blood count, ALT, AST, CRP, ESR) will be&#xD;
      evaluated at baseline and at the end of study drug treatment on week 6. Adverse Events will&#xD;
      be reported to the local Ethics Committee and National Agency of Medicine according to the&#xD;
      regulation 2/2004 Clinical Medicinal Trials on Humans.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical review:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The planned sample size of 33 in each arm is projected to provide 80% power to detect a mean&#xD;
      difference of 25 in leg pain VAS at 6 weeks at a two-sided alpha level of 0.0125, assuming&#xD;
      that the standard deviation is 20. For Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) 33 patients in each&#xD;
      arm, would provide 80% power to detect a mean difference of 16 in ODI score at a two-sided&#xD;
      alpha level of 0.0125, assuming a standard deviation of 13. Alpha-level of 0.0125 was&#xD;
      selected to correct the multiple testing caused by two primary end-point variables and two&#xD;
      comparisons for each variable, placebo versus the two different doses of active treatment.&#xD;
      The sample size calculation is based on normality assumption; however the final analysis will&#xD;
      be performed using non-parametric method. However the use of baseline value as covariate in&#xD;
      the analysis should compensate the lost power due to the use of distribution free-method.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis of the primary end-points:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the study is to demonstrate the efficacy of adalimumab versus placebo by means of&#xD;
      Oswestry Disability Index and Leg Pain VAS at week 6. To maintain the overall 5% significance&#xD;
      level of the primary end-points, Bonferroni adjustment will be applied, i.e. in the four&#xD;
      significance tests applied to the primary hypothesis; p-value should be below 0.0125 to be&#xD;
      considered as statistically significant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As a primary analysis method, non-parametric analysis of covariance with baseline value as a&#xD;
      covariate will be applied to ODI and Leg Pain VAS at week 6 separately for adalimumab 40 mg&#xD;
      every week versus placebo and adalimumab 40 mg every other week versus placebo.&#xD;
      Intent-to-treat population will be used in the primary analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patient data will be evaluated by intent-to-treat principle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the secondary end-points Bonferroni adjustment will be applied on end-point level.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rescue medication:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rescue medication will be arranged in case of lack of efficacy at the discretion of the&#xD;
      investigator. If cauda equine symptoms or signs of large neurological defects will occur&#xD;
      surgery will be performed. Also if the medication is considered a failure by the&#xD;
      investigator's clinical judgment the patients will have the opportunity to be evaluated for&#xD;
      disc surgery.&#xD;
