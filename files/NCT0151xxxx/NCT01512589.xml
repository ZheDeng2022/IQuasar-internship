  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical research study is to learn how safe and effective proton-beam&#xD;
      therapy (PBT) may be in comparison to intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) in&#xD;
      combination with chemotherapy in patients with esophageal cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PBT and IMRT are both forms of radiation therapy that are designed to treat a specific area&#xD;
      of the body while affecting as little of the surrounding normal tissue as possible. PBT is a&#xD;
      newer technology that is designed to further reduce the amount of radiation that affects the&#xD;
      surrounding normal tissue. However, this is still being studied.&#xD;

      Study Treatment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will be randomly assigned (as&#xD;
      in the flip of a coin) to 1 of 2 study groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If you are in Group 1, you will receive IMRT.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If you are in Group 2, you will receive PBT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will receive radiation therapy 1 time each day, 5 days a week (Monday through Friday) for&#xD;
      up to 28 treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Your doctor may think it is in your best interest to also receive chemotherapy while you are&#xD;
      receiving radiation therapy. If this occurs, you will sign a separate consent form for these&#xD;
      drugs with a full description of how they are given and the risks they may cause.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Visits:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before you begin receiving radiation therapy, you will have a baseline visit. The following&#xD;
      tests and procedures will be performed:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 1-2 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Your performance status will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a PET/CT or CT scan to check the status of the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have lung function tests&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will complete the symptom and quality of life questionnaires.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Your esophagus will be examined using an endoscope. If the doctor thinks it is needed,&#xD;
           you will have a biopsy to check the status of the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will then have a study visit every week while you are receiving radiation therapy. The&#xD;
      following tests and procedures will be performed:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Your medical history will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a physical exam.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Your performance status, weight, and vital signs will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 1-2 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will complete the symptom and quality of life questionnaires.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Length of Study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will receive radiation therapy for up to 28 treatments (about 5Â½ weeks). You will no&#xD;
      longer be able to receive radiation therapy if the disease gets worse, if intolerable side&#xD;
      effects occur, or if you are unable to follow study directions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Your participation on the study will be over once you have completed the follow-up visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-Up:&#xD;
&#xD;
      After you stop receiving radiation therapy, there will be a 4-6 week break. During this time,&#xD;
      you will contacted 2 times each week to complete the symptom and quality of life&#xD;
      questionnaires. You will receive a call from an automated calling service or from the study&#xD;
      staff at a scheduled time of your choosing. You will continue to be followed routinely during&#xD;
      treatment and for follow-up visits and tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      About 4-6 weeks after you stop receiving radiation therapy, the following tests and&#xD;
      procedures will be performed:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Your medical history will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a physical exam.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Your performance status, weight, and vital signs will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a PET/CT scan to check the status of the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have lung function tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 1-2 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will complete the symptom and quality of life questionnaires.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Your esophagus will be examined using an endoscope. If the doctor thinks it is needed,&#xD;
           you will have a biopsy to check the status of the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If your doctor thinks it is in your best interest after you have completed radiation therapy,&#xD;
      you will have surgery to remove the tumor. You will sign a separate consent form that&#xD;
      describes the procedure and its risks. As part of this study, the study doctor will check you&#xD;
      for side effects and discomfort after the surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Every 3-4 months for 2 years, and then every 4-6 months for the next 3 years, you will have&#xD;
      follow-up visits. The following tests and procedures will be performed:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Your medical history will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a physical exam.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Your performance status, weight, and vital signs will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have either a CT or a PET/CT scan to check the status of the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will complete the symptom and quality of life questionnaires. (If the disease gets&#xD;
           worse, these questionnaires will no longer be completed.)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additionally, the following tests and procedures will be performed at follow-up visits only&#xD;
      when the doctor thinks they are needed:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 1-2 tablespoons) may be drawn for routine tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You may have lung function tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Your esophagus will be examined using an endoscope. If the doctor thinks it is needed,&#xD;
           you will have a biopsy to check the status of the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You may be contacted by the study staff to ask about your health, even if you choose not to&#xD;
      return to MD Anderson for follow-up visits after completing treatment for esophageal cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an investigational study. IMRT and PBT are delivered using FDA-approved and&#xD;
      commercially available methods. It is investigational to compare IMRT to PBT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 180 patients will take part in this study. All will be enrolled at MD Anderson.&#xD;
