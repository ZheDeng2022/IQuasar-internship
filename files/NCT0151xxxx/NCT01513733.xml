  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The standard of care for men with metastatic CRPC in 2010 following progression on docetaxel&#xD;
      is cabazitaxel or abiraterone acetate/prednisone. Based on results from two other studies,&#xD;
      cabazitaxel and prednisone has become a standard second line chemotherapy regimen and becomes&#xD;
      the backbone upon which to improve upon. Thus, the primary objective of this study is to&#xD;
      determine the recommended dose of tasquinimod in combination with cabazitaxel and prednisone&#xD;
      based on safety and tolerability in men with chemorefractory metastatic castration-resistant&#xD;
      prostate cancer (CRPC).&#xD;
