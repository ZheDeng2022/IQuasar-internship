      This study is being performed to reduce unwanted fat, in various body areas, using a new&#xD;
      applicator and control unit for Zeltiq.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and feasibility of a new product under&#xD;
      development for non-invasive fat reduction. The new product delivers controlled cooling via a&#xD;
      conformable surface applicator, rather than the existing vacuum applicator. A range of&#xD;
      treatment parameters will be investigated. At the investigator's discretion, each treatment&#xD;
      area may receive up to 3 treatments, spaced 2 - 8 weeks apart. The subjects will return for&#xD;
      follow-up at 2 months and 4 months after final treatment. Therefore, the entire study period&#xD;
      may last up to 8 months.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Male or female subjects &gt; 18 years of age and &lt; 65 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject has clearly visible fat on intended treatment area(s), which in the&#xD;
             investigator's opinion, may benefit from the treatment(s). Treatment areas include:&#xD;
             abdomen, saddlebag (outer aspect of upper thighs), upper arms and inner thighs.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject has not had weight change exceeding 10 pounds in the preceding month.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject with body mass index (BMI) between 25 and 35. BMI is defined as weight in&#xD;
             pounds multiplied by 703 divided by the square of the height in inches.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject agrees to maintain his/her weight (i.e., within 5 pounds) by not making any&#xD;
             major changes in their diet or lifestyle during the course of the study.&#xD;

          -  Subject has had a surgical procedure(s) in the area of intended treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject has had an invasive fat reduction procedure (e.g., liposuction,&#xD;
             abdominoplasty, mesotherapy) in the area of intended treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject has had a non-invasive fat reduction and/or body contouring procedure in the&#xD;
             area of intended treatment within the past 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject needs to administer, or has a known history of subcutaneous injections into&#xD;
             the area of intended treatment (e.g., heparin, insulin) within the past month.&#xD;

          -  Subject has a known history of Raynaud's disease, or any known condition with a&#xD;
             response to cold exposure that limits blood flow to the skin.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject has a history of bleeding disorder or is taking any medication that in the&#xD;

             or evaluation (stretch marks is not an exclusion).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject has an active implanted device such as a pacemaker, defibrillator, or drug&#xD;
             delivery system&#xD;

          -  Subject is pregnant or intending to become pregnant in the next 8months.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject is lactating or has been lactating in the past 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject is unable or unwilling to comply with the study requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject is currently enrolled in a clinical study of any other unapproved&#xD;
             investigational drug or device.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any other condition or laboratory value that would, in the professional opinion of the&#xD;
             investigator, potentially affect the subject's response or the integrity of the data&#xD;
             or would pose an unacceptable risk to the subject.&#xD;
