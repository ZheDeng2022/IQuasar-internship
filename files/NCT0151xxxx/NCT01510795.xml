    <textblock>
      Chronic allograft nephropathy is one of dominant causes of long term kidney transplant&#xD;
      failure. Its main histological determinant is interstitial fibrosis and tubular atrophy.&#xD;
      Mechanisms of these changes are multifactorial and are not completely elucidated. Epithelial&#xD;
      mesenchymal transition (EMT) might be one of the mechanisms. On molecular level role of renin&#xD;
      angiotensin aldosterone system (RAAS) has been recognized. Recently, mineralocorticoid&#xD;
      hormone aldosterone has been proposed as a possible direct contributor to the progression of&#xD;
      renal injury and fibrosis, beside his well known role as a regulator of extracellular fluid&#xD;
      volume and sodium and potassium balance. In this study the investigators will determine the&#xD;
      impact of mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist use on progression of chronic scores in&#xD;
      transplanted kidney over one year. The investigators hypothesis is that spironolactone use in&#xD;
      kidney transplant patients will slow down progression of chronic histological changes-&#xD;
      interstitial fibrosis, tubular atrophy and arteriolar hyalinosis.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Chronic allograft nephropathy (CAN) is the main cause of long term kidney transplant failure.&#xD;
      Its main histological determinant is interstitial fibrosis and tubular atrophy, but&#xD;
      mechanisms of these changes are not completely elucidated and seem to be multifactorial. It&#xD;
      seems that these histological changes develop as a consequence of immunological and&#xD;
      non-immunological mechanisms. Study from Nankivell and al. defined two phases of CAN, early,&#xD;
      attributed to immunological mechanisms; acute rejection, persistent subclinical rejection and&#xD;
      ischemic- reperfusion injury, and late injury, characterized with progressive arteriolar&#xD;
      hyalinosis, glomerulosclerosis andInterstitial fibrosis and tubular atrophy (IF/TA), which&#xD;
      was attributed in part to calcineurin inhibitor use and in part to ongoing immunologic&#xD;
      injury.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In vitro studies and animal studies have shown epithelial mesenchimal transition as one of&#xD;
      possible mechanisms and early markers of subsequent IF/TA. EMT is defined as process where&#xD;
      completely differentiated epithelial cells undergo transition into fibroblast phenotype&#xD;
      cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is known that on molecular level RAAS has crucial role in development of progressive renal&#xD;
      injury and fibrosis. Role of angiotensin II in progression of chronic kidney injury is&#xD;
      established and well known. It mediates kidney injury by increasing intraglomerular capillary&#xD;
      pressure leading to ultrafiltration of plasma proteins and by promoting cell growth and&#xD;
      fibroproliferative effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is hypothesized that aldosterone as a component of RAAS may also have direct role in&#xD;
      proinflammatory and profibrotic mechanisms of initiation and progression of kidney injury.&#xD;
      Aldosterone is a mineralocorticoid hormone produced in adrenal cortex zona glomerulosa and&#xD;
      has crucial role as a regulator of extracellular fluid volume and sodium and potassium&#xD;
      balance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It has been shown in the rat models that aldosterone activates mTOR kinase, which promotes&#xD;
      cell proliferation and contributes in early phases of injury healing. However, a prolonged&#xD;
      activation of mTOR seems to promote development of interstitial fibrosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although the molecular pathways of aldosterone-mediated renal injury have not yet been fully&#xD;
      elucidated, aldosterone may directly contribute to the final common pathway of renal&#xD;
      fibrosis. In vitro studies have shown that aldosterone significantly increases TGF beta and&#xD;
      fibronectin production by mesangial cells in culture and that this event is abolished by the&#xD;
      aldosterone antagonist spironolactone. Randomized studies have shown beneficial role of&#xD;
      blockade of mineralocorticoid receptors in heart failure. Also studies have shown beneficial&#xD;
      role of mineralocorticoid receptor blockade with nonselective antagonist spironolactone in&#xD;
      reducing albuminuria in both diabetic and non diabetic chronic kidney disease (CKD) and&#xD;
      antiproteinuric effect of a selective aldosterone inhibitor, eplerenone in type 2 diabetic&#xD;
      patients with microalbuminuria. Role of mineralocorticoid receptor blockade in kidney&#xD;
      transplant recipients has not been extensively evaluated so far.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study we hypothesized that use of a mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist,&#xD;
      spironolactone, may contribute to slower progression of chronic histological changes in renal&#xD;
      allografts.&#xD;
