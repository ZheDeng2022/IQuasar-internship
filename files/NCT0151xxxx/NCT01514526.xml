      -  Design: non-randomized, open label, phase II clinical trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Study population and disease: adult patients with metastatic or locally advanced&#xD;
           non-resectable adrenocortical carcinoma, confirmed histologically.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Estimated number of patients: 15.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Study drug: dovitinib (TKI-258), dosed on a flat scale of 500mg/day on a 5 days on / 2&#xD;
           days off.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Treatment duration: study treatment period will be continued until disease progression,&#xD;
           unacceptable toxicity, death or premature withdrawal from study. An average of 6 months&#xD;
           treatment period is expected.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Study duration: expected recruitment period will be 18 months, and patients will be&#xD;
           followed for 6 additional months after last patient is included in the trial.Study total&#xD;
           expected duration is 24 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Sites: the study is planned to be conducted in 7 Spanish centers.&#xD;

             throughout the trial and 8 weeks after the end of Dovitinib treatment. Oral,&#xD;
             implantable, or injectable contraceptives may be affected by cytochrome P450&#xD;
             interactions, and are therefore not considered effective for this study. Women of&#xD;
