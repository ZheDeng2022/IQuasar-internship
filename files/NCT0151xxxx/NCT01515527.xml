  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical research study is to learn if cladribine given in combination with&#xD;
      low-dose cytarabine (LDAC) and decitabine can help control the disease in patients with AML&#xD;
      or MDS. The safety of this drug combination will also be studied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cladribine is designed to interfere with the cell's ability to process DNA (the genetic&#xD;
      material of cells). It can also insert itself into the DNA of cancer cells to stop them from&#xD;
      growing and repairing themselves.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cytarabine is designed to insert itself into DNA of cancer cells to stop them from growing&#xD;
      and repairing themselves.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Decitabine is designed to damage the DNA of cells, which may cause cancer cells to die.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an investigational study. Cladribine is FDA approved and commercially available for&#xD;
      use in patients with hairy cell leukemia. Its use in patients with AML is investigational.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cytarabine is FDA approved and commercially available for use in patients with AML.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Decitabine is FDA approved and commercially available for use in patients with MDS. Its use&#xD;
      for patients with AML is investigational.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 160 patients will take part in this study. All will be enrolled at MD Anderson.&#xD;

      Study Drug Administration:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are eligible to take part in this study, you will receive 1 or 2 cycles of induction&#xD;
      therapy followed by up to 17 cycles of consolidation therapy. Each study cycle is 4 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Induction Cycles:&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Days 1-5, you will receive cladribine by vein over 1-2 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Days 1-10, you will give yourself the cytarabine by injection twice a day about 12 hours&#xD;
      apart. You will receive instructions on how give yourself the injections.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You may receive up to 2 cycles at this dose and schedule.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Consolidation Cycles:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Consolidation cycles will begin on Cycle 2 regardless of how many cycles you received of&#xD;
      induction therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During Cycles 2, 5, 6, 9, 10, 13, 14, 17, and 18:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  On Days 1-3, you will receive cladribine by vein over 1-2 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  On Days 1-10, you will give yourself cytarabine by injection twice daily starting 3 to 6&#xD;
           hours after the start of the cladribine infusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cycles 3, 4, 7, 8, 11, 12, 15, and 16:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Â°On Days 1-5, you will receive decitabine by vein over 1-2 hours each day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Length of Treatment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      You may continue taking the study drugs for up to 18 cycles. You will no longer be able to&#xD;
      take the study drug if the disease gets worse, if intolerable side effects occur, or if you&#xD;
      are unable to follow study directions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Your participation on the study will be over when you have completed follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Visits:&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Day 1 of every cycle:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a physical exam, including measurement of your weight and vital signs.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Your performance status will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Day 21 (+/- 7days) of the induction cycle, you may have a bone marrow aspirate to check&#xD;
      the status of the disease. After that, you will have a bone marrow aspirate every 2 weeks (or&#xD;
      more often if your doctor feels it is necessary). If your routine blood tests show that there&#xD;
      is still leukemia, you may not need to have the bone marrow samples collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood (about 1-2 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests at least 1 time weekly until&#xD;
      remission, then every 2-4 weeks during treatment, the every 4-8 weeks while you are on the&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-Up Visits:&#xD;
&#xD;
      When you are off treatment, every 6 -12 months you will be contacted by a member of the study&#xD;
      staff. You will be asked about any side effects you may be having. The phone calls will take&#xD;
      about 5-10 minutes. You will continue to be called for as long as possible.&#xD;
