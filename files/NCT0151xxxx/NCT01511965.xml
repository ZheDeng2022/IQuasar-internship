    <textblock>
      Vitiligo is a depigmenting skin disease common. Vitiligo is caused by the disappearance of&#xD;
      melanocytes in the epidermis. Vitiligo is the cause of disfigurement, psychological and&#xD;
      social, that sounds a lot about the quality of life. Currently the standard treatment for&#xD;
      vitiligo is ultraviolet ray (UV), but it only allows a 50% repigmentation of lesions in half&#xD;
      of patients. The applications of autologous epidermal cells in the liquid phase is a&#xD;
      promising new therapeutic approach of vitiligo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main goal of this study is to compare prospectively the repigmentation of vitiligo&#xD;
      lesions induced by application of autologous epidermal cells in liquid phase associated with&#xD;
      light therapy and light therapy alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study's secondary goals: compare the applications of epidermal cells to phototherapy alone&#xD;
      and phototherapy, in respect of:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Obtain a repigmentation&gt; 70% (threshold considered aesthetically relevant)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The occurrence of adverse events&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patient satisfaction regarding the efficacy and safety of treatment&#xD;

      MAIN CRITERIA&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Rates of repigmentation of the vitiligo lesions to 12 months&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The lesions of the layers defined by the investigator to Month 0, Month 3, Month 6 and&#xD;
           Month 12 will be analyzed by an image analysis system managed by a computer.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Digital photos is taken in order to illustrate the quantitative results above.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY CRITERIA&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Repigmentation&gt; 70% of the vitiligo lesions at 12 months&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Rates of repigmentation of the vitiligo lesions at 12 months&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Side effects: the frequency, severity and time of occurrence will be reported for each&#xD;
           treatment. Side effects are classified into grades according to World Health&#xD;
           Organization (WHO) criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patient satisfaction of the effectiveness and tolerance will be studied using visual&#xD;
           analogue scales graded from 0 to 10.&#xD;
