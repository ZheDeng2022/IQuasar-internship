  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Complete pelvic and para-aortic lymphadenectomy performed at the time of primary surgical&#xD;
      staging for endometrial cancer increases operative time and surgical morbidity, but appears&#xD;
      to be necessary in most high grade and deeply invasive cancers. To date, the Mayo Clinic&#xD;
      approach has not been reproduced, and the investigators propose to validate their algorithm&#xD;
      at the University of Kentucky utilizing intra-operative consultation (IOC). The preliminary&#xD;
      data at the University of Kentucky for IOC and endometrial cancer outcomes suggest that the&#xD;
      investigators are well-suited to perform this investigation. A surgical approach that is&#xD;
      tailored to the patient's cancer biology is rational, supported by the recent literature, and&#xD;
      medically compelling since the co-morbidities of many obese, low-risk EC patients put them at&#xD;
      significantly increased perioperative risk for complete lymphadenectomy.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  All patients must be surgical candidates for complete hysterectomy and bilateral&#xD;
             salpingo-oophorectomy and pelvic and aortic lymphadenectomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have a histologically confirmed diagnosis of endometrial cancer and no&#xD;
             clinical evidence of extra-uterine disease on preoperative evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Preoperative evaluation to rule-out extra-uterine disease may include CT scan, MRI, or&#xD;
             ultrasound. Preoperative imaging is not mandatory for study enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients may have received prior systemic chemotherapy. Such therapy must have been&#xD;
             completed at least 5 years prior to study entry and the patient has no evidence of&#xD;
             disease subsequent to such therapy. Patients must not have received neoadjuvant&#xD;
             chemotherapy for the present disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have GOG performance status 0, 1, or 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have an estimated survival greater than or equal to 3 months&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have met the pre-entry requirements specified in Section 7.0.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have signed an approved informed consent and HIPAA authorization.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with clinical evidence of disease beyond the uterus, including presence of&#xD;
             suspicious aortic or inguinal nodes on imaging or clinical exam.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have received previous vaginal, pelvic, or abdominal irradiation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who received chemotherapy directed at the present disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have circumstances that will not permit completion of this study or the&#xD;
             required follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with renal abnormalities, such as pelvic kidney, horseshoe kidney, or renal&#xD;
             transplantation, that would require modification of surgical lymph node assessments.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with a history of other invasive malignancies, with the exception of&#xD;
             non-melanoma skin cancer within the last five years.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with GOG Performance Grade of 3 or 4.&#xD;
