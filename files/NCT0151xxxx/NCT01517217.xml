    <textblock>
      There is a considerable lack of knowledge in everyday surgical practice concerning treatment&#xD;
      with a corset after laparotomy, in surgery for incisional hernia or as conservative&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aims are to elucidate effects of corset treatment on patient experience and pain,&#xD;
      physiology and abdominal wall strength.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Effects of corset treatment after laparotomy will be studied in a randomised trial with the&#xD;
      hypothesis that postoperative corset-use improves respiratory physiology and reduce pain. The&#xD;
      primary end-point is PeakCoughFlow change, secondary end-points are vital capacity, residual&#xD;
      volumes and patient perception as measured by the ventral hernia pain questionnaire (VHPQ)&#xD;
      developed by our group. This study is powered for 50 patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Conclusions from the study are of such a nature that they can be immediately transferred to&#xD;
      clinical practice.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Presently, there is a significant lack of knowledge in everyday surgical practice concerning&#xD;
      treatment for incisional hernias and treatment with a corset before and after surgery or as a&#xD;
      means of conservative treatment. For many years, corsets have been used in surgical&#xD;
      departments without evidence to support this practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Corsets are expensive and require good patient compliance. Some arguments for the use of&#xD;
      corsets are reduced pain and tension in the abdominal wall and prevention of the development&#xD;
      and recurrence of incisional hernias, as well as their use as a truss in cases where&#xD;
      conservative treatment is decided on.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this project is thus to ameliorate the lack of knowledge surrounding corset use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      More specifically, the aims of the project are to clarify the effects of corset use on&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Physiological parameters&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Measured with spirometry, Vital capacity (VC), Forced Expiratory Volume (FEV), Peak&#xD;
                Expiratory Flow (PEF) and with coughPEF&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Patient comfort, pain and self-perceived experience&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Measured with VAS scale for pain. VHPQ (ventral hernia pain questionary) for pain.&#xD;
                Recording of medication. Grade of mobilisation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Corset treatment has been thought to affect cardiovascular and respiratory function as well&#xD;
      as intra abdominal pressure both in positive and negative directions. There are no scientific&#xD;
      publications that specifically describe and evaluate these effects. One reason for this could&#xD;
      be that the assessment of such parameters is difficult and time-consuming in clinical&#xD;
      practice, for instance spirometry. Less complicated alternatives e.g. Peak Expiratory Flow&#xD;
      rate (PEF) has been considered too imprecise. However, recently, a simpler and more efficient&#xD;
      instrument has been developed for measuring lung function, the Peak Cough Flow (PCF). It has&#xD;
      been validated for use in pulmonary function testing in patients with neuromuscular&#xD;
      disorders, where it is used to predict the risk of an inadequate coughing response and mucus&#xD;
      clearance. Moreover, portable digital spirometers have been developed that can be easily used&#xD;
      in an ambulatory setting. Postoperatively, similar problems may arise with a reduction in&#xD;
      vital capacity. It is therefore important to investigate the effects of corsets on lung&#xD;
      function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Many patients that undergo laparotomy have an indwelling urinary catheter during the first&#xD;
      postoperative days, often as a result of epidural anaesthesia but also for monitoring of&#xD;
      fluid balance. A urinary catheter also allows for the measurement of the intra abdominal&#xD;
      pressure, which, together with the measurement of systemic blood pressure, gives a good&#xD;
      estimate of physiological parameters which can be used to compare different treatment groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A randomised controlled study concerning the postoperative use of corsets after laparotomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: Postoperative corset-use improves respiratory physiology as measured using the&#xD;
      PCF without impairing other spirometric parameters. Corsets also reduce pain and discomfort&#xD;
      after surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Consecutive patients undergoing laparotomy at the Centre for Gastrointestinal surgery at the&#xD;
      Karolinska University Hospital are asked whether they would accept to participate in a&#xD;
      randomised study where one arm receives a corset for five days postoperatively and the other&#xD;
      does not receive a corset after laparotomy. The primary end-point is PCF change, secondary&#xD;
      end-points are vital capacity, residual volumes and patient perception as measured by the&#xD;
      VHPQ. A GCP-trained research nurse with extensive experience will be in charge of monitoring&#xD;
      and collection of data. PCF will be measured using a portable PCF apparatus (Peak flow meter,&#xD;
      HS Clerment Clarke International) whereas other spirometric parameters are measured using a&#xD;
      portable computer-assisted vitalograph (IM-Medico ML 2525). Pain and the functional status of&#xD;
      the patients will be measured using the VHPQ as described above and the EuroQoL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on previous measurements, a normal PCF without corset is assumed to be around&#xD;
      360ml/min. Assuming that the standard deviation is 40ml/min and that the corset improves&#xD;
      performance by 10%, 21 patients will be required in each group (42 in total) at 95%&#xD;
      significance level and power of 80%. In order to compensate for patient drop-out, we plan to&#xD;
      include 50 patients. If intra abdominal pressure rises above 28cmH2O or if there are signs of&#xD;
      wound infection, the corset will be removed. The wound will be photographed on day five in&#xD;
      all patients.&#xD;
