  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A lung condition called bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is a major cause of poor outcomes&#xD;
      and death for premature infants. Infants with BPD are also at high risk for pulmonary&#xD;
      hypertension (PH)-an important contributor to their condition. Previous research has&#xD;
      suggested that a protein in the blood, endothelin-1 (ET-1), is associated with pulmonary&#xD;
      disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aims to investigate the incidence of PH and levels of ET-1 among premature babies&#xD;
      with BPD. It will also potentially allow us to focus further research efforts and treatment&#xD;
      towards these infants, some of our sickest patients at LPCH.&#xD;

      This study aims to 1) investigate the incidence of PH among premature infants with BPD versus&#xD;
      those without BPD and 2) investigate ET-1 levels in infants with BPD-associated PH versus&#xD;
      those without BPD-associated PH. This study will allow us to help define a high-risk&#xD;
      population at LPCH-namely, premature infants with BPD-associated PH. It will also potentially&#xD;
      allow us to focus further research efforts and treatment targets towards these infants who&#xD;
      encompass some of our sickest patients at LPCH.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In 2009 the Division of Lung Diseases of the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute (NHLBI)&#xD;
      published seven priority areas for research in pediatric pulmonary diseases, one of which was&#xD;
      pulmonary vascular disease. An emphasis was made on finding 'clinical strategies that&#xD;
      anticipate the development of PH [which] may allow earlier recognition and more aggressive&#xD;
      therapy, thereby slowing the development of PH in many chronic lung parenchymal and vascular&#xD;
      diseases'. This study attempts to address this goal. Specifically we aim to evaluate ET-1&#xD;
      levels in premature infants diagnosed with BPD and with BPD-associated PH. If ET-1 levels are&#xD;
      found to correlate with disease state the possibility of prediction and possible early&#xD;
      treatment for PH in these infants is raised and merits investigation.&#xD;
