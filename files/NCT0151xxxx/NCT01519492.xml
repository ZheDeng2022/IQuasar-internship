    <textblock>
      This open-label Phase 2 study is designed as a proof-of-concept study to evaluate the&#xD;
      efficacy of a total daily dose of 400 mg of AFN-12520000 using a number of newly defined&#xD;
      early endpoints, conventional endpoints, and composite endpoints to determine clinical&#xD;
      response. Safety and tolerability will also be evaluated by conventional endpoints.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will enroll up to 100 patients with a clinically documented diagnosis of Acute&#xD;
      Bacterial Skin and Skin Structure Infections (ABSSSI) due to staphylococci. Patients meeting&#xD;
      eligibility criteria will be identified and evaluated in a hospital or specialized clinic.&#xD;
      After consent is obtained, the first dose of study medication will be administered. Daily&#xD;
      clinical assessments will be conducted at the hospital and/or outpatient clinic during the&#xD;
      first 5 days of treatment. Adverse events (AEs) and response to therapy will also be&#xD;
      assessed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will consist of a screening period, which includes the baseline visit; a treatment&#xD;
      period, and an end-of-treatment (EOT) visit; and a follow-up period, which includes a&#xD;
      short-term (Test-of-Cure [TOC]) follow-up (STFU/TOC) visit and a long-term follow-up (LTFU)&#xD;
      visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment regimens as short as 5 days (10 doses) and as long as 14 days (28 doses) will be&#xD;
      permitted depending on individual response to treatment. The anticipated time commitment for&#xD;
      patient participation in the study will be approximately 20 to 42 days from&#xD;
      screening/baseline to the LTFU visit. The total duration of the study will be &lt; 12 months.&#xD;
