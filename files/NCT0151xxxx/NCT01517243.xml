  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In the past 5 years, treatment for metastatic Renal Cell Carcinoma (mRCC) has focused on&#xD;
      agents directed at blocking tumor and vascular growth pathways. Sunitinib blocks the vascular&#xD;
      endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFr) and temsirolimus is an inhibitor of mammalian&#xD;
      target of rapamycin (mTOR). Both sunitinib and temsirolimus are FDA approved agents for mRCC.&#xD;
      When agents like these are given together, the toxicity increases but they can be given&#xD;
      safely, at full doses, sequentially. We hypothesize that alternating these agents will double&#xD;
      the progression free survival (PFS) of the agents when given sequentially.&#xD;

      SUMMARY: Alternating Targeted Therapy in Patients with Metastatic Renal Cell Carcinoma: A&#xD;
      Phase II Study of Alternating Sunitinib and Temsirolimus&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with measurable metastatic renal cell carcinoma (any histology) are eligible. All&#xD;
      patients will be treated as outlined below with sunitinib alternating with temsirolimus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be treated continuously, until evidence of progression of disease, or for up to&#xD;
      two cycles following disappearance of all disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A cycle is defined as:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sunitinib 50mg by mouth daily for 4 weeks followed by a two week rest Temsirolimus 25mg IV&#xD;
      weekly for 4 weeks followed by a two week rest&#xD;

    <description>To be assigned a status of partial response or complete response, changes in tumor measurements must be confirmed by repeat assessments that should be performed no less than 4 weeks after the criteria for response are first met. In the case of stable disease, follow-up measurements must have met the stable disease criteria at least once after study entry at a minimum interval (in general, not less than 6-8 weeks) that is defined in the study protocol.</description>
