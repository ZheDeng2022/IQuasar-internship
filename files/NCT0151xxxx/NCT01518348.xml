      To evaluate the diagnostic performance (primary) and safety (secondary) of seven T.R.U.E.&#xD;
      Test Panel 3.2 allergens: Gold sodium thiosulfate, Hydrocortisone-17-butyrate, Bacitracin,&#xD;
      Parthenolide, Methyldibromoglutaronitrile, Disperse blue 106, and Bronopol in pediatric&#xD;
      subjects 6-18 years of age with suspected contact dermatitis based on symptoms and clinical&#xD;

      The study population will include at least 100 consecutive subjects 6-17 years of age with&#xD;
      suspected contact dermatitis based on symptoms and clinical history. Study subjects must be&#xD;
      otherwise healthy and fulfill entry criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 1 (Day 0): Informed Consent, Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria Assessment, Medical and&#xD;
      Medicine History, Pregnancy Test (for female subjects of child-bearing potential), Panel&#xD;
      Placement.Visit 2 (Day 2): Panel Removal, Panel Adhesion and Irritation Assessment, AE and&#xD;
      Concomitant Medication Review.Visit 3 (Day 3- approximately 72 hours after placement): Skin&#xD;
      Reactions Assessed and Scored. Adverse Event and Concomitant Medication Review.Visit 4 (Day 4&#xD;
      approximately 96 hours after placement): Skin Reactions Assessed and Scored. Adverse Event&#xD;
      and Concomitant Medication Review.Visit 5 (Day 7±1): Skin Reaction Assessed and Scored. AE&#xD;
      and Concomitant Medication Review. Visit 6 (Day 21±2): Skin Reaction Assessed and Scored. AE&#xD;
      and Concomitant Medication Review. Visit performed via phone call, unless investigator&#xD;
      determines that subject should be seen in clinic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Endpoint: Frequency and characterization of positive reactions per allergen.&#xD;
      Secondary Endpoint: Prevalence of late or persistent reactions, irritation, adhesion,&#xD;
      subject-reported itching or burning, and adverse events.&#xD;
