      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of a combined treatment with&#xD;
      cilengitide and metronomic oral temozolomide as measured by 6 months overall survival (OS)&#xD;
      after diagnosis of relapse or tumour progression in children and adolescents with relapsed or&#xD;
      refractory high-grade malignant glioma and diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To evaluate the safety and toxicity of the study treatment by common toxicity criteria&#xD;
           (CTC; version 4.0).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To assess&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  the response rates at 6 months (continuous complete response = CCR, complete&#xD;
                response = CR, partial response = PR, stable disease = SD, progressive disease =&#xD;
                PD) and&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  progression-free survival (PFS) at 6 months, and&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  response rates, OS, and PFS at 12 months after relapse diagnosis or diagnosis of&#xD;
                tumor progression. Response will be presented including histopathological variants.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To assess the pharmacokinetics of cilengitide administered as part of the study&#xD;
           treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Indication and study population for this trial:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment of relapsed or refractory high grade gliomas and diffuse intrinsic pontine gliomas&#xD;
      in paediatric patients ≥ 3 years and &lt; 18 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients included in the study receive&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cilengitide 1800 mg/m² i.v. twice weekly&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Temozolomide 75 mg/m²/d p.o. for 6 weeks, followed by 1 week rest with a mandatory&#xD;
           platelet-count dependent dose adaptation rule: mandatory blood counts twice weekely:&#xD;
           Platelets ≥ 100 000/µl (≥ 100 Gpt/l): 75 mg/m², platelets ≥ 50 000 - &lt; 100 000/µl (≥ 50&#xD;
           - &lt;100 Gpt/l): 50 mg/m², platelets &lt; 50 000/µl (&lt;50 Gpt/l): stop temozolomide until&#xD;
           platelet recovery ≥ 100 000/µl (≥100 Gpt/l)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Study treatment in the individual patient is scheduled for 1 year unless tumor&#xD;
           progression or excessive toxicity occurs. However, study treatment may be extended&#xD;
           beyond 1 year upon individual decision.&#xD;

      Indication:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment of relapsed or refractory high grade gliomas and diffuse intrinsic pontine gliomas&#xD;
      in paediatric patients ≥ 3 years and &lt; 18 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background and rationale:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Relapsed or refractory high-grade gliomas or diffuse intrinsic pontine gliomas (in the&#xD;
      following both addressed as high grade gliomas = HGG) in children and adolescents represent a&#xD;
      very bad prognosis group for which a recommended standard salvage therapy is currently not&#xD;
      available.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The combination of cilengitide and metronomic temozolomide will be investigated in the&#xD;
      present trial as new treatment strategy for these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Metronomic temozolomide was shown to act via inhibition of tumour angiogenesis and as a&#xD;
      cytotoxic agent. Cilengitide might act via tumour angiogenesis and also inhibits tumour cell&#xD;
      migration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For both drugs, safe doses with only low toxicity had been defined in phase I trials for&#xD;
      paediatric patients with recurrent or refractory brain tumours (Cilengitide: 1800 mg/m² twice&#xD;
      weekly; metronomic Temozolomide: 75-80 mg/m²/d in a 6 week schedule followed by one week&#xD;
      rest) In a phase II trial for adult patients with relapsed glioblastoma cilengitide as single&#xD;
      agent showed a trend towards higher efficacy with 2000 mg twice weekly as compared to 500 mg&#xD;
      twice weekly. Furthermore, in a phase II trial of newly diagnosed adult glioblastoma&#xD;
      patients, signs of clinical activity of cilengitide in combination with radiotherapy and&#xD;
      conventional temozolomide was seen in the methylated MGMT gene promoter subgroup. Based on&#xD;
      these findings, a large randomized phase III trial investigating cilengitide in combination&#xD;
      with standard therapy (temozolomide and radiation) in this subgroup was started recently.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Metronomic temozolomide was also shown to be still effective in glioma patients suffering&#xD;
      from relapse after temozolomide standard therapy. Interestingly, the mode of action appears&#xD;
      to be widely independent of the MGMT status, probably due to MGMT depletion by continuous&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In conclusion, for both drugs signs of clinical activity have been shown in relapsed&#xD;
      glioblastoma patients, even after failure of temozolomide standard therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prospective, non-randomized phase II trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients 3 years and &lt; 18 years of age with high grade glioma or diffuse intrinsic pontine&#xD;
      glioma relapsed after or refractory to standard therapy recruited by approved trial sites&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size:&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is planned to include 33 patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therapy:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients included in the study receive&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cilengitide 1800 mg/m² i.v. twice weekly&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Temozolomide 75 mg/m²/d p.o. for 6 weeks, followed by 1 week rest with a mandatory&#xD;
           platelet-count dependent dose adaptation rule: mandatory blood counts twice weekely:&#xD;
           Platelets ≥ 100 000/µl (≥ 100 Gpt/l): 75 mg/m², platelets ≥ 50 000 - &lt; 100 000/µl (≥ 50&#xD;
           - &lt;100 Gpt/l): 50 mg/m², platelets &lt; 50 000/µl (&lt;50 Gpt/l): stop temozolomide until&#xD;
           platelet recovery ≥ 100 000/µl (≥100 Gpt/l)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Study treatment in the individual patient is scheduled for 1 year unless tumor&#xD;
           progression or excessive toxicity occurs. However, study treatment may be extended&#xD;
           beyond 1 year upon individual decision.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Biometry:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis and sample size calculation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The feasibility and efficacy of the HIT-HGG-CilMetro therapy will be assessed by a single&#xD;
      stage analysis. Sample size calculation is based on the 6 month overall survival rate. This&#xD;
      survival rate was found to be 44% in a historical study population from the HIT-GBM data&#xD;
      base. An overall survival rate of 59% in the present study is considered to be of clinical&#xD;
      relevance. Based on a one sided one sample χ2-test and a significance level α=5% a sample&#xD;
      size of 33 patients is planned. This sample size implies a power of 50%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Schedule:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is scheduled to start on January 1, 2012. The recruitment period for the trial will&#xD;
      last 24 months until December 31, 2013. Individual follow-up for at least 1 year after study&#xD;
      entry is required for this protocol. The study will be finished 30 days after completion of&#xD;
      study treatment of the last patient enrolled, i.e. the expected end of the trial will be&#xD;
      January 31, 2015.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Long-term follow-up is strongly recommended and will be organised via the HIT-HGG Study&#xD;
      Office.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the start of the study is delayed, given dates will change accordingly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Financial support:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany, provides a grant for the conduct of the trial, supplies&#xD;
      Cilengitide free of charge and agrees to perform the laboratory assessments for&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics.&#xD;
