      Constructing a learning curve in ultrasound guided needling&#xD;
&#xD;
      Observational study - How many attempts, with continuous training and feedback, at in-plane&#xD;
      ultrasound guided needling in a phantom model are required to attain competence?&#xD;
&#xD;
      The use of ultrasound to enable real-time needle visualisation during regional anaesthesia&#xD;
      (placing local anaesthetic, via a needle, near nerves to result in numbing of an area of the&#xD;
      body to be operated on) has gained in popularity in recent years. It has been recognised by&#xD;
      NICE (National Institute for Clinical Excellence) and guidelines on training have been&#xD;
      published, with UK equivalents pending. These call for training in the technique on models or&#xD;
      'phantoms' prior to patient contact.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is unknown how much experience is necessary to attain competence in a phantom, prior to&#xD;
      proceeding to patient contact. One study looking at experiential learning of the technique&#xD;
      found a very wide range of experience needed between individuals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to study the effect of any changes in training methods on the learning of the&#xD;
      technique it is necessary to have a baseline learning curve.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators are introducing a training package for anaesthetists new to the technique&#xD;
      to meet the recommendations on initial phantom based training. Alongside this the&#xD;
      investigators aim to gather prospective observational data allowing the investigators to&#xD;
      generate a learning curve for the technique. This involves making a video recording of the&#xD;
      ultrasound images of approximately 50 sequential attempts at performing a task in a phantom,&#xD;
      with ongoing instruction and coaching. The whole training package will take approximately 1&#xD;
      hour.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These video clips will be reviewed and sequential attempts graded for quality of needle&#xD;
      visualisation and task completion. This will allow the investigators to use a statistical&#xD;
      method, Cumulative Sum (Cusum) analysis, to determine how many attempts were required to&#xD;
      attain proficiency. The investigators hope to recruit approximately 20 participants to this&#xD;
      pilot study, and from this determine the average amount of training necessary to attain&#xD;
      proficiency. Using Cusum analysis requires the use of an acceptable failure rate, usually&#xD;
      chosen arbitrarily. To add greater meaning to our findings the investigators will also invite&#xD;
      anaesthetists experienced in the technique of in-plane ultrasound guided needling to&#xD;
      participate. By measuring the actual success rate of our local trainers the investigators&#xD;
      will be able to make a meaningful comparison of the training required to achieve a similar&#xD;
      level of success.&#xD;

      1.0 INTRODUCTION&#xD;
&#xD;
      1.1 BACKGROUND INFORMATION&#xD;
&#xD;
      The use of ultrasound as a tool for guiding regional anaesthesia has been growing in&#xD;
      popularity and use. The National Institute of Clinical Excellence (NICE) has acknowledged the&#xD;
      role of ultrasound in regional anaesthesia by issuing guidance governing incorporation in&#xD;
      clinical practice. The focus of this guidance was on the adoption of ultrasound by properly&#xD;
      trained practitioners in a setting of adequate clinical governance, consent and audit. [1]&#xD;
      Trainees in anaesthesia are expected to become familiar with regional anaesthetic techniques,&#xD;
      increasingly involving the use of ultrasound. Of paramount importance is the acquisition of&#xD;
      the skill of needle visualisation under ultrasound guidance in real time. There is growing&#xD;
      consensus that trainees should undergo a period of training on a phantom prior to performing&#xD;
      techniques on patients [2, 3].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Given the increasing use of ultrasound for regional anaesthesia within our trust, together&#xD;
      with the recognition of the requirement for adequate formal training in its use we plan to&#xD;
      introduce a program of phantom based training in ultrasound needle visualisation and control&#xD;
      for trainees prior to commencing clinical practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      1.2 RATIONALE FOR CURRENT STUDY&#xD;
&#xD;
      The amount of training required to achieve competency, both on phantom models or in clinical&#xD;
      practice is unknown. Some work has been done using the cumulative sum (CUSUM) method with&#xD;
      several different anaesthetic related practical procedures. These show that individual&#xD;
      learning curves vary greatly, however the CUSUM method has shown promise as a technique for&#xD;
      determining the acquisition of competence. [4, 7] Unsurprisingly it has also been suggested&#xD;
      that providing training, before and during phantom practice, improves the success and rate of&#xD;
      skill acquisition [4, 5, 6]. In order to conduct any future work into the effect of&#xD;
      interventions in training methods on learning curves in regional anaesthesia a baseline&#xD;
      learning curve needs to be constructed. As part of our planned training program we intend to&#xD;
      collect observational data to enable the construction of a baseline learning curve for the&#xD;
      attainment of competence in ultrasound needle visualisation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One of the weaknesses of previous attempts at incorporating CUSUM into training analysis has&#xD;
      been the need to arbitrarily select values for acceptable and unacceptable failure rates. We&#xD;
      hope to address this in our study by simultaneously determining the local failure rate of the&#xD;
      technique amongst proficient practitioners, and applying this data in CUSUM analysis of data&#xD;
      collected during novice training. In order to provide pragmatic data applicable to the&#xD;
      average anaesthetic department we will define proficient practitioners, for the purposes of&#xD;
      calculating acceptable failure rates, as those anaesthetists routinely incorporating in-plane&#xD;
      ultrasound guided needle visualisation in their practice and teaching it to others.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators suggest that providing novices with instruction during the practice&#xD;
      process, rather than allowing a 'discovery learning' approach as previously studied [4], will&#xD;
      result in a lower total and narrower spread of attempts required to attain competence. By&#xD;
      using a measured acceptable failure rate we will add validity to our data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2. STUDY OBJECTIVES&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objective - Determine the amount of training required (number of attempts) to attain&#xD;
      statistical proficiency in the average anaesthetist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcomes - Determine the effect of prior experience or demographic factors on the&#xD;
      rate of skill acquisition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Determine whether trainer assessment predicts statistical outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3. STUDY DESIGN&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed study will be a prospective observational study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We aim to recruit 20 participants in this pilot study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods -&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anaesthetists within the department will be invited to participate in a short training and&#xD;
      observational exercise.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be asked for consent in advance to have the ultrasound images of their&#xD;
      practice attempts recorded anonymously and subsequently assessed. Refusal of consent will not&#xD;
      preclude them from taking part in the training if desired.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be asked to provide some background demographic data on subjects which may&#xD;
      be expected to effect the rate of skill acquisition. This will include age, sex, grade of&#xD;
      anaesthetist, prior experience with in-plane ultrasound guided needling (regional anaesthesia&#xD;
      or vascular access), exposure to computer gaming. (See Appendix)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be asked to declare their level of experience&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. New to in-plane ultrasound guided needling. Little or no experience in technique.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Some exposure to in-plane ultrasound guided needling. Infrequent use in clinical&#xD;
           practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Regularly incorporate in-plane ultrasound guided needling in clinical practice. Teaching&#xD;
           technique to others.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Experience gained in Ultrasound Guided Regional Anaesthesia and vascular access&#xD;
           techniques will be deemed valid.&#xD;
&#xD;
           All participants, irrespective of previous experience, will then complete a training /&#xD;
           observational package as detailed below.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Training sessions will be run on a one to one basis by the local Fellow in Regional&#xD;
           Anaesthesia. Participants will spend approximately 15 minutes viewing a brief powerpoint&#xD;
           presentation introducing the principles of ultrasound followed by machine orientation&#xD;
           and instruction on needle handling and visualisation techniques. The trainer will&#xD;
           demonstrate the technique.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Participants will then spend approximately 45 minutes of hands on practice at needle&#xD;
           handling and visualisation while performing a task in a standardised gelatin based&#xD;
           phantom. Instruction and feedback will be provided throughout, with the aim being to&#xD;
           develop or demonstrate skill in maintaining needle tip visualisation at all times while&#xD;
           advancing towards and contacting a target. It is anticipated that participants will&#xD;
           undertake approximately 50 needle passes during this time.&#xD;
&#xD;
           For each attempt the participant will be asked to advance the needle under ultrasound&#xD;
           guidance toward a target, maintaining constant needle visualisation to the best of their&#xD;
           ability. A brief period of initial shallow insertion to locate the needle with&#xD;
           ultrasound will be permitted, as will partial withdrawal and re-alignment of the needle.&#xD;
           A fresh puncture of the phantom will be regarded as the next attempt. Once participants&#xD;
           feel they have optimised the needle position contacting the target the trainer will&#xD;
           ensure optimal needle visualisation to exclude tip placement within or traversing the&#xD;
           target. The needle will be withdrawn and the participant proceeds to the next attempt.&#xD;
&#xD;
           We will be using a Sonosite M-Turbo ultrasound machine with HFL38X 6-13MHz linear probe&#xD;
           and Sonoplex 80mm 20G needles. Ultrasound images will be recorded digitally using an&#xD;
           &quot;iGrabber&quot; USB video capture device onto a laptop computer. Recording will start&#xD;
           immediately prior to needle insertion. Once the participant has optimised needle&#xD;
           position for that attempt the image will be frozen to indicate the end point, unfrozen&#xD;
           and visualisation of the needle optimised by the trainer (with participant maintaining&#xD;
           static needle position) before withdrawal of the needle, after which recording will be&#xD;
           stopped. The process will be repeated for each subsequent attempt. At the end of the&#xD;
           period of training of participants rating themselves as within group 1 the trainer will&#xD;
           record whether they feel the participant has demonstrated competence, for later&#xD;
           comparison with CUSUM analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Following this period of training and observation the anonymised video recordings of the&#xD;
           participants attempts will be exported for review by two consultant anaesthetists, each&#xD;
           experienced in ultrasound guided regional anaesthesia. Each needle pass will be&#xD;
           assessed, out of sequence, and graded against previously agreed criteria based on a&#xD;
           previously published system [4](appendix). Sequential grading information for each&#xD;
           participant will be collated. Data for participants in group 3 will be used to calculate&#xD;
           the actual failure rate of anaesthetists within our department considering themselves&#xD;
           competent enough to teach the technique. This will be used as the acceptable failure&#xD;
           rate to generate a CUSUM chart for those participants in group 1 to assess the&#xD;
           attainment of competence. If desired this information will subsequently be fed back to&#xD;
           the participant, but will not play any part in determining the progress of their&#xD;
           training or practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
           3.1 STUDY OUTCOME MEASURES&#xD;
&#xD;
           The outcome will be an indication of the amount of training required to attain&#xD;
           competence in the average novice anaesthetist, validated by using the measured success&#xD;
           rate of those already deemed competent working within the department.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. PARTICIPANT ENTRY&#xD;
&#xD;
           4.1 PRE-REGISTRATION EVALUATIONS Nil&#xD;
&#xD;
           4.2 INCLUSION CRITERIA Any anaesthetist within the anaesthetic dept of Aberdeen Royal&#xD;
           Infirmary or Woodend Hospital, Aberdeen providing written, informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
           4.2 EXCLUSION CRITERIA Refusal of consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
           4.3 WITHDRAWAL CRITERIA Participants are free to withdraw from the study at any time,&#xD;
           with no detriment to training offered.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. ASSESSMENT AND FOLLOW UP&#xD;
&#xD;
           Following construction of CUSUM charts and analysis of each participants performance,&#xD;
           the individuals results will be fed-back to them if desired. No further follow-up is&#xD;
           planned beyond this. Following feedback links between data and person-identifiable&#xD;
           information will be broken.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. STATISTICS AND DATA ANALYSIS&#xD;
&#xD;
           This is a pilot project and a power calculation was not possible.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Assistance will be given by the medical statistics department of the University of&#xD;
           Aberdeen with the construction of CUSUM charts and any subsequent analysis if required.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. REGULATORY ISSUES&#xD;
&#xD;
      7.1 ETHICS APPROVAL&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Chief Investigator will obtain ethics approval from the North of Scotland Regional Ethics&#xD;
      Committee. The study will be submitted for Site Specific Assessment (SSA) at each&#xD;
      participating NHS Trust. The Chief Investigator will require a copy of the SSA approval&#xD;
      letter before accepting participants into the study. The study will be conducted in&#xD;
      accordance with the recommendations for physicians involved in research on human subjects&#xD;
      adopted by the 18th World Medical Assembly, Helsinki 1964 and later revisions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      7.2 CONSENT&#xD;
&#xD;
      All potential participants will be provided invitation and participant information letters&#xD;
      detailing the study aims, objectives and protocol. A minimum period of overnight will be&#xD;
      allowed to peruse information, after which an opportunity to discuss the study will be made&#xD;
      available prior to seeking informed, written consent. An independent point of contact will be&#xD;
      available to discuss the study if desired. Participants are free to cease participation in&#xD;
      the study at any point if desired, with no effect on training opportunity. Equally should&#xD;
      potential participants refuse consent to the study, they may complete the training session if&#xD;
      desired.&#xD;
&#xD;
      7.3 CONFIDENTIALITY&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Chief Investigator will preserve the confidentiality of the participants taking part in&#xD;
      the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All data will be collected under an individual study number only. A separate database will be&#xD;
      held linking participant contact details to study numbers. To further decrease the&#xD;
      possibility of participant identification by assessors video clips will be assessed in&#xD;
      batches of five.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following feedback of statistical performance to participants links between data and&#xD;
      person-identifiable information will be broken.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All data will be collected in paper form then transferred to a digital format. Paper copies&#xD;
      will be stored in a locked box in the acute pain team office at woodend hospital. Digital&#xD;
      information will be stored on a password protected account on the NHS Grampian computer&#xD;
      network.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It will be necessary to process the anonymised video recordings on a home computer prior to&#xD;
      assessment.&#xD;
