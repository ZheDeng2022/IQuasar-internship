  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      For effective anesthesia and interventional pain treatments, correct needle placement is&#xD;
      crucial. Currently used methods to guide needle placement and confirm the actual treatment&#xD;
      location before injection of the medication include: image-guidance, loss-of-resistance, and&#xD;
      electrical stimulation. However, accuracy of needle placement could be improved if&#xD;
      information would be available that would complement the current methods. We have developed&#xD;
      the so-called &quot;photonic needle&quot; technology based on optical spectroscopy that has the&#xD;
      potential to provide such complementary information.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is an observational study in a limited number of patients. A common&#xD;
      ultrasound-guided regional anesthesia procedure has been selected, during which data will be&#xD;
      acquired with the photonic needles at a number of points along the needle trajectory that&#xD;
      allow for confirmation by imaging.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rationale for this study is to investigate the potential of the technology to discriminate&#xD;
      tissues that are relevant to distinguish during the procedure.&#xD;

      The primary objective of the trial is to investigate if the photonic needle technology can&#xD;
      reliably identify the thoracic paravertebral space. Diffuse reflectance spectra will be&#xD;
      acquired during needle advancement, with custom-made needle stylets that contain optical&#xD;
      fibers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main study parameters are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Successfully acquired diffuse reflectance spectra obtained in the thoracic paravertebral&#xD;
           space, and spectra obtained during needle advancement.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Confirmation of sonographic thoracic paravertebral localization, defined as tissue&#xD;
           imaging in all locations of the needle where the diffuse reflectance spectra have been&#xD;
           collected .&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Recordings of reaction to a small test dose of lidocaine 2% with epinephrine 1:200.000&#xD;
           at target position for regional anesthesia (to exclude vascular localization of the&#xD;
           needle)&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. &quot;certainty score&quot; on a 3-point scale (1 = uncertain, 2 = certain, 3 = very certain)&#xD;
           provided by the physician for assignment of the type of tissue present at the needle&#xD;
           tip, based on the information available from imaging and/or aspiration and/or reaction&#xD;
           to a small injection of epinephrineOther study parameters&#xD;
&#xD;
      The endpoint of the study is a statistical analysis of the difference between diffuse&#xD;
      reflectance spectra obtained at non-paravertebral and paravertebral measurement locations.&#xD;
