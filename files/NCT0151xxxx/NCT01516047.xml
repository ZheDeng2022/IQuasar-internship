  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate systemic exposure of abiraterone acetate in adult&#xD;
      male patients with severe hepatic impairment and is being conducted to collect information&#xD;
      that will support clinical dosing recommendations for this subpopulation.&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a non-randomized (individuals will not be assigned by chance to study treatments),&#xD;
      open-label (individuals will know the identity of study treatments), single dose, 2-cohort&#xD;
      study of abiraterone acetate in approximately 16 adult men. Participants will either have&#xD;
      severe hepatic impairment (Cohort 1) or qualify for the control group with normal hepatic&#xD;
      function (Cohort 2). This study will consist of a screening period followed by a 4-day&#xD;
      open-label treatment phase and subsequently a 28-day follow up after the study dose of&#xD;
      abiraterone acetate suspension. Patients will be admitted to the study center on Day -1, a&#xD;
      single dose of study drug will be administered on the morning of Day 1, and patients will&#xD;
      remain at the study center until completion of the 72-hour pharmacokinetic (PK; study of what&#xD;
      the body does to a drug) blood sample collection in the morning of Day 4. Enrollment will&#xD;
      begin sequentially with patients in the severe hepatic impairment cohort. Enrollment for&#xD;
      Cohort 1 will be staggered in order to evaluate safety and tolerability. The study will not&#xD;
      proceed if &gt;=Grade 3 toxicity or serious adverse events considered related to abiraterone&#xD;
      acetate are observed. Additional patients may be enrolled if at least 8 patients in each&#xD;
      cohort do not complete the required assessments, including the PK blood sample collections.&#xD;
      The aim will be to treat the remaining patients in Cohort 1 at a suspension dose yielding an&#xD;
      exposure equivalent to 1000 mg tablet in healthy individuals. If the dose is adjusted after&#xD;
      Study Evaluation Team review, additional patients may be enrolled to ensure at least 8&#xD;
      patients complete the study at the final dose. Once enrollment of patients in the severe&#xD;
      hepatic impairment cohort is completed, the matched-control cohort will be dosed. Serial PK&#xD;
      samples will be collected during the open-label treatment phase as detailed in the protocol.&#xD;
      Safety will be monitored throughout the study.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Patients with hepatic impairment are required to be on medication and/or treatment&#xD;
             regimen to treat their underlying hepatic impairment or medical conditions before&#xD;
             dosing with study drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants in the control cohort who test positive for hepatitis B surface antigen&#xD;
             (HBsAg) or hepatitis C antibodies will not be permitted to enroll in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with hepatic impairment who have acute or exacerbating hepatitis, fluctuating&#xD;

             of clinical and/or laboratory signs of hepatic impairment in the judgment of either&#xD;
             the investigator or the sponsor's medical monitor will be excluded from participating&#xD;
             in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with hepatic impairment taking antiviral therapy for treatment of active&#xD;
             hepatitis infection at the time of screening, previously diagnosed with hepatocellular&#xD;
             carcinoma, or who have a history of biliary sepsis within the past 2 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with severe hepatic impairment should not have Gilbert's syndrome or &gt;= Grade&#xD;
             3 hepatic encephalopathy where the patient lacks the capacity to provide informed&#xD;
             consent as judged by the investigator. Mild or moderate hepatic encephalopathy that&#xD;
             would not impede informed consent in the investigator's judgment is permitted.&#xD;
