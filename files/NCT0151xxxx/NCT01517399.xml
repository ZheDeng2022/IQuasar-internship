  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the effects of tivantinib on the pharmacokinetics&#xD;
      of omeprazole, s-warfarin, caffein, midazolam, or digoxin in patients with cancer.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Nonclinical studies have indicated that tivantinib (parent molecule) has the potential to&#xD;
      inhibit CYP3A4 ([I]/Ki=0.15, midazolam as substrate), CYP2C19 ([I]/Ki=0.98), CYP2C9&#xD;
      ([I]/Ki=0.44), and CYP1A ([I]/Ki=0.37), and the efflux transporter P glycoprotein (P-gp)&#xD;
      (I2/IC50=82) at the clinical concentrations being studied in the Phase 3 development program.&#xD;
      In addition, tivantinib has major circulating plasma metabolite(s) which also have been shown&#xD;
      in nonclinical studies to exhibit similar CYP inhibition potential. The results of this study&#xD;
      will evaluate the potential of tivantinib to influence the pharmacokinetics of&#xD;
      CYP3A4/CYP2C19/CYP2C9/CYP1A and/or P-gp substrates, and help to provide the guidance to&#xD;
      clinicians on co-administration of tivantinib with drugs metabolized by&#xD;
      CYP3A4/CYP2C19/CYP2C9/ CYP1A and/or transported by P-gp.&#xD;
