  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this protocol is to address the feasibility for further development&#xD;
      of the VMAT2-binding compound 18F-AV-133 as a diagnostic radiopharmaceutical in the field of&#xD;
      diabetes. Specifically, this study will evaluate 18F-AV-133 imaging in patients with type 1&#xD;
      diabetes, patients with type 2 diabetes and in healthy controls in order to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Obtain information regarding the safety of 18F-AV-133 in these populations;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Determine whether uptake, distribution, or clearance of 18F-AV-133 in the pancreas&#xD;
           differs between subjects with predicted reduced beta cell mass (patients with type 1 or&#xD;
           type 2 diabetes of long duration) and normal beta cell mass (healthy volunteers);&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Evaluate the PET imaging pharmacokinetics of 18F-AV-133 in abdominal organs of healthy&#xD;
           control subjects and patients with type 1 or type 2 diabetes;&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Obtain preliminary information regarding the appropriate time window for optimal PET&#xD;
           imaging of 18F-AV-133 in the pancreas post-administration for type 1, type 2, and normal&#xD;
           healthy individuals;&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Obtain preliminary information regarding an appropriate reference tissue for evaluating&#xD;
           the PET imaging results of 18F-AV-133 in the pancreas; and&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Evaluate the imaging properties of 18F-AV-133 in the pancreas relative to the brain in a&#xD;
           subset of subjects.&#xD;
