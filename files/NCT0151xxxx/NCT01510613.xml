    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of Pomalidomide and Dexamethasone&#xD;
      in patients who did not achieve a complete response after initial treatment with both an&#xD;
      alkylating agent (Melphalan or Cyclophosphamide) and Bortezomib. Patients who received 1&#xD;
      previous treatment without achieving a complete response (CR), but who could not be treated&#xD;
      with alkylators and/or Bortezomib due to contraindications, will be included.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This will be a phase II open-label single-arm dose-escalation study. Patients with systemic&#xD;
      AL amyloidosis who did not achieve a complete response after initial treatment with both an&#xD;
      alkylating agent (Melphalan or Cyclophosphamide) and Bortezomib will be enrolled. Patients&#xD;
      who received 1 previous treatment, but who could not be treated with alkylators and/or&#xD;
      Bortezomib due to contraindications, will be eligible. Twenty-eight patients will be enrolled&#xD;
      in the study. The patients will be treated with the combination of Pomalidomide and&#xD;
      Dexamethasone given orally in 28 day cycles continuously, i.e. until hematologic or organ&#xD;
      progression or unacceptable toxicity. There will be 2 dose levels of Pomalidomide (2 and 4&#xD;
      mg/day). A standard 3+3 dose escalation design will be used. If less than 2 of 6 patient&#xD;
      experience dose limiting toxicity at dose level 1, then all other patients will be treated at&#xD;
      dose level 2. There will be 2 dose levels also for Dexamethasone (20 and 40 mg/week). The&#xD;
      dose of dexamethasone will be adjusted on an individual basis, considering fluid retention&#xD;
      and repetitive ventricular arrhythmias at baseline, as well as Dexamethasone-related adverse&#xD;
      events. The study comprises 3 periods: screening, treatment (with evaluations of response at&#xD;
      the end of every single cycle) followed by the end-of-treatment evaluation and follow-up.&#xD;
      After giving written informed consent, subjects will be evaluated for eligibility for&#xD;
      enrollment in the study and baseline evaluations will be performed. Treatment will be&#xD;
      continued until progression or unacceptable toxicity is observed. After treatment&#xD;
      discontinuation, patients will be followed for survival and any possible Second Primary&#xD;
      Malignancies signals for 2 years.&#xD;

             be performed within 24 hours prior to the start of study drug. The subject may not&#xD;
             receive study drug until the Investigator has verified that the results of these&#xD;
             pregnancy tests are negative. Will be warned that sharing study drug is prohibited and&#xD;
             will be counseled about pregnancy precautions and potential risks of fetal exposure.&#xD;

             about pregnancy precautions and potential risks of fetal exposure. Must agree to&#xD;
             abstain from donating blood, semen, or sperm during study participation and for at&#xD;

          -  All subjects: No more than a 28-day supply of study drug will be dispensed at a time.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Female: FCBP with regular cycles must agree to have pregnancy tests weekly for the&#xD;
             first 28 days of study participation and then every 28 days while on study, at study&#xD;
             discontinuation, and at day 28 following discontinuation from the study. If menstrual&#xD;
             cycles are irregular, the pregnancy testing must occur weekly for the first 28 days&#xD;
             and then every 14 days while on study, at study discontinuation, and at days 14 and 28&#xD;

             of every 28 days. During counseling, subjects must be reminded to not share study drug&#xD;
             and to not donate blood. Pregnancy testing and counseling must be performed if a&#xD;
             subject misses her period or if her pregnancy test or her menstrual bleeding is&#xD;
