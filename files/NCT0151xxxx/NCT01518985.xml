      This will be a phase 1 randomized, double-blind, 2-period, 2-sequence crossover trial&#xD;
      enrolling 6 healthy volunteers to assess the impact of IV-administered Bendavia on the&#xD;
      endothelial dysfunction induced by a single cigarette.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Analysis of variance (ANOVA) between group mean endothelial function (EndoPAT Index) following smoking a single cigarette with and without Bendavia</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, +30, +60, +90 minutes post-study-drug administration start</time_frame>
    <description>Endothelial function will be determined using EndoPAT 2000 (Itamar Medical Ltd) prior to and after smoking of one unfiltered cigarette and prior to and after initiation of study drug. Group comparison of endothelial function (EndoPAT Index) between placebo and active study drug within a subject will be performed.&#xD;
EndoPAT quantifies the endothelium-mediated changes in vascular tone. A post-occlusion to pre-occlusion ratio is calculated providing the EndoPAT index.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Anova between group mean inflammatory laboratory marker (hs-CRP; mg/L) after smoking one cigarette with and without Bendavia</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 24 hours post-study-drug administration</time_frame>
    <description>hs-CRP will be evaluated prior to and after smoking of one unfiltered cigarette and prior to and after initiation of study drug. Group comparison of hs-CRP levels between placebo and active study drug within a subject will be performed.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>ANOVA between group means of urinary 8-isoprostane (ng/mg of creatinine) after smoking one cigarette with and without Bendavia</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 48 hours post-study-drug administration</time_frame>
    <description>8-isoprostane will be measured prior to and after smoking of one unfiltered cigarette and prior to and after initiation of study drug. Group comparison of laboratory results between placebo and active study drug within a subject will be performed.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number adverse events with and without Bendavia</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Study Day 10</time_frame>
    <description>Adverse events will be tabulated by treatment group. No statistical analysis will be preformed.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Assessment of Bendavia exposure measured by area Under the Curve (AUC; ng*hr/mL)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 48 hours post-study-drug administration</time_frame>
    <description>Bendavia levels will be measured and pharmacokinetic parameters reported.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>ANOVA between group means of urinary 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine (pg/mL) after smoking one cigarette with and without Bendavia</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 48 hours post-study-drug administration</time_frame>
    <description>8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine will be measured prior to and after smoking of one unfiltered cigarette and prior to and after initiation of study drug. Group comparison of laboratory results between placebo and active study drug within a subject will be performed.</description>
