    <description>for AIM-Neutral and AIM-Meaning. This will involve development of AIM materials and assessments (based on the preliminary work conducted by Beard et al.70-73) that target fear of cancer recurrence through feedback from BCS (n=10). It will also involve training of the research staff in the assessments and AIM. This will accomplish Primary Aim 1.</description>

    <description>We will evaluate two versions of an 8-session AIM, one that includes threat and neutral stimuli (AIMNeutral; n=37), and one that includes threat and positive stimuli (AIM-Meaning; n=37), comparing them both to a computer placebo (CP) condition (n=37). Part 2 will allow us to assess the feasibility of the research procedures, the appropriateness of the psychological and physiological outcome measures, preliminary estimates of pre- and post-intervention effect sizes and reliable change estimates, and variables associated with any observed outcomes. This will accomplish Aims 2 and 3.</description>

Phase 2 - randomized, single-blind, placebo-controlled, proof-of-concept pilot trial. Phase 3 - 3 parts. Part 1 of Phase 3, clickable prototype of the iThrive app will be created. Part 2, usability testing of the app by observing timing and navigation with BCS in a laboratory setting will be completed. Part 3, acceptability of the iThrive app will be assessed by conducting a small RCT (n=30). Phase 4 - 3 parts. Part 1 of Phase 4, clickable prototype of the iThrive app will be created. In Part 2, usability testing of the app will be completed by observing timing and navigation with RCS either in person or remotely. In Part 3, acceptability of the iThrive app will be assessed by conducting a small RCT (n=90).</description>

        sites outside of MSKCC. Participants may be patients who were treated at MSKCC or breast&#xD;
        cancer survivors who were treated elsewhere and learned about the study through an&#xD;
        advertisement. The study summary and research team contact information will be&#xD;
        available/advertised in the community through MSKCC Connections,MSKCC Survivorship Program&#xD;
        and the American Cancer Society website.&#xD;
