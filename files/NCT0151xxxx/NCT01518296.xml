    <textblock>
      Pelvic organ prolapse is a common disorder that affects 3-9% of adult women. Treatment of&#xD;
      this disorder varies and includes conservative and interventional treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pelvic organs prolapse grading has an important roll in determining the appropriate&#xD;
      treatment. Developments in this field has led to the development of an agreed method to rate&#xD;
      the degree of pelvic organs prolapse (POPQ).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The roll of Urodynamic test is to assess whether there is urinary incontinence and underlying&#xD;
      cause.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Richard C. et al publication, that presented the Pelvic Organ Prolapse Quantification&#xD;
      (POPQ) method for the first time, there was no reference to the urinary bladder state (full&#xD;
      or empty) during the examination, hence the investigators are asking to conduct a prospective&#xD;
      study in order to evaluate the degree of pelvic organs prolapse according to POPQ method&#xD;
      during urodynamic examination, with a full and empty urinary bladder.&#xD;

      Pelvic organ prolapse is a common disorder that affects 3-9% of adult women. Treatment of&#xD;
      this disorder varies and includes behavioral therapy, pelvic floor muscles rehabilitation&#xD;
      exercises, medication therapy, devices that are tailored to the patient in order to improve&#xD;
      pelvic organ support and various surgical procedures. Developments in this field and the need&#xD;
      to tailor the appropriate treatment to the type and degree of pelvic organ prolapse resulted&#xD;
      in the development of an agreed method to rate the degree of pelvic organs prolapse.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pelvic organs prolapse grading has an important roll in determining the appropriate&#xD;
      treatment. A big proportion of women who suffer from pelvic organ prolapse suffer from&#xD;
      urinary system disorders as well, such as difficulty in urinating, urinary incontinence, and&#xD;
      urgency and frequency.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the pelvic floor reconstruction clinic, women who suffer from pelvic organs prolapse,&#xD;
      undergo a preliminary workup that includes a medical questionnaire, physical examination to&#xD;
      evaluate the degree of pelvic organ prolapse according to the Pelvic Organ Prolapse&#xD;
      Quantification method (POPQ), and a urodynamic test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The impression of differences in the degree of prolapse according to POPQ method, before and&#xD;
      after urination, has led to the hypothesis that the degree of pelvic organs prolapse varies&#xD;
      according to the degree of fullness of the bladder&#xD;
&#xD;
      Urodynamic test is a test performed during patient evaluation at the pelvic floor&#xD;
      reconstruction clinic. During this test the woman is asked to empty her bladder and then two&#xD;
      transducers are inserted, one into the bladder and the other into the rectum. During the test&#xD;
      the bladder is filled with physiological solution and then the patient is asked to urinate.&#xD;
      During bladder emptying urinary flow velocity is measured and the pressure in the abdomen and&#xD;
      bladder recorded for later evaluation.&#xD;
