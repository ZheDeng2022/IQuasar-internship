  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1b/2 study. In Phase 1b portion, subjects will know the treatment they are&#xD;
      receiving . Subjects will receive U3-1287 with trastuzumab plus paclitaxel . The phase 1b&#xD;
      portion will determine if adding U3-1287 to trastuzumab plus paclitaxel will be safe in&#xD;
      subjects with metastatic breast cancer. In phase 2 portion, subjects will be blinded to the&#xD;
      treatments they are receiving . Subjects will receive either trastuzumab plus paclitaxel with&#xD;
      U3-1287 or trastuzumab plus paclitaxel and placebo.The phase 2 portion will determine if&#xD;
      adding U3-1287 to trastuzumab plus paclitaxel will be safe and improve survival in subjects&#xD;
      with metastatic breast cancer.&#xD;
