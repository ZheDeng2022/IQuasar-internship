      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - The endocannabinoid system is involved in different body functions and processes. It helps&#xD;
      regulate appetite and mood, and sends signals to the nervous system. It may also be involved&#xD;
      in how the body produces insulin during digestion. Researchers want to test two drugs that&#xD;
      work on the endocannabinoid system: nabilone and CP-945,598. These drugs may be able to&#xD;
      affect insulin levels in the blood. This information may suggest possible new treatments for&#xD;
      people with diabetes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To study how the endocannabinoid system is involved in insulin production and action.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Healthy men between 21 and 55 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be screened with a physical exam and medical history. They will&#xD;
           provide blood and urine samples. They will also have imaging studies to test their brain&#xD;
           responses, especially to food-related cues. Some participants will also have a study&#xD;
           visit to test their insulin resistance levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will have four separate study visits 6 weeks apart. They will keep a food&#xD;
           diary before each visit. At each visit, they will have one of the following combinations&#xD;
           of drugs:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Double placebo&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Placebo and nabilone&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Placebo and low dose of CP-945,598&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Placebo and high dose of CP-945,598.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will have follow-up visits 1 week after each study visit. Blood samples&#xD;
           will be taken....&#xD;

      Objectives and Specific Aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
      We plan to investigate whether the endocannabinoid system is involved in the regulation of&#xD;
      insulin secretion from Beta cells and in the modulation of insulin action in peripheral&#xD;
      tissues in humans. We hypothesize that cannabinoid receptor 1 (CB1R) antagonist CP-945,598&#xD;
      will increase insulin secretion from Beta cells and improve insulin sensitivity in peripheral&#xD;
      tissues while cannabinoid receptor (CBR) agonist nabilone will decrease insulin secretion&#xD;
      from Beta cells and worsen insulin sensitivity in peripheral tissues. Moreover, we will&#xD;
      investigate the brain s control over the initial phase of insulin secretion (cephalic insulin&#xD;
      response) and the effect of central cannabinoid receptors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experimental Design and Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Twenty healthy men, age 21-55, will be recruited for this study. This is a randomized,&#xD;
      double-blind, placebo-controlled cross-over study. Each subject will serve as his own control&#xD;
      and each person will have four different intervention visits spaced at least 6 weeks apart.&#xD;
      During each visit, they will receive one of the following medications in random order:&#xD;
      placebo, nabilone 2 mg, CP-945,598 15 mg, or CP-945,598 45 mg. A sequential&#xD;
      hyperglycemic-euglycemic clamp procedure and a 3-hr oral glucose tolerance test will be used&#xD;
      to study the effect of CP-945,598 and nabilone on insulin secretion and insulin action in&#xD;
      healthy men. To identify brain areas involved in cephalic insulin response, a functional MRI&#xD;
      will be used to assess brain activation in response to food images in association with&#xD;
      frequent blood sampling.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Medical Relevance and Expected Outcome:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on our pre-clinical animal data, CB1R antagonist enhances insulin secretion and action&#xD;
      in response to glucose while CBR agonist virtually shuts off insulin secretion and worsens&#xD;
      insulin action in response to glucose. The application of novel, pre-clinical findings to an&#xD;
      understanding of human biology and pathobiology is of fundamental and critical importance.&#xD;
      This study will give us a better understanding of the regulators of insulin secretion from&#xD;
      Beta cells and insulin sensitivity in humans, and this new understanding is of importance to&#xD;
      finding new treatments for type 2 diabetes.&#xD;

&#xD;
               1. Healthy men only&#xD;
&#xD;
                  (We want to study men because the magnitude of acute insulin response for men and&#xD;
                  women is different. In addition, as women may become pregnant in the course of&#xD;
                  the study, and since this is a physiology study only, and not one related to&#xD;
                  treatments, we want to remove any confounders and lessen any chance of drop-out.)&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Age 21-55 (Age restriction is used to remove age as a confounding factor because&#xD;
                  Beta cells function tends to deteriorate and first phase secretion becomes less&#xD;
