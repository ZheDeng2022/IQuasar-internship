      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Many people who lose a limb feel pain in the missing limb. This feeling is called phantom&#xD;
      limb pain. Researchers do not fully understand what causes this pain. Differences in people's&#xD;
      genes may play a role. Comparing the genes of people with and without phantom limb pain may&#xD;
      help researchers better understand this feeling, who is likely to develop it, and how to&#xD;
      treat it.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To study whether genetic differences affect phantom limb pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Individuals at least 18 years of age who have lost an arm or leg at least 3 months ago.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be screened with a medical history and physical exam.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will answer questions about how they lost the limb, and whether they feel&#xD;
           phantom limb pain. They will also have a test to measure their sensitivity to heat and&#xD;
           cold.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will provide a blood sample for genetic testing.&#xD;

      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed clinical trial will investigate the role of the human genome including genetic&#xD;
      variations and gene expression profiles on the development of phantom limb pain (PLP).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be recruited from military personnel with major limb amputations. A total of&#xD;
      one thousand subjects with upper or lower extremity amputations of any level will be enrolled&#xD;
      in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eight hundred subjects with chronic PLP (PLP patient) and 200 patients without PLP (non-PLP&#xD;
      patient) will assess the severity of their pain symptom. Each participant will undergo a&#xD;
      routine blood draw from which DNA and RNA will be harvested.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome measures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Using Affymetrix SNP 6.0 technology, which identifies up to 1 million single nucleotide&#xD;
      polymorphisms (SNPs) and 1 million copy number variations in the human genome, the&#xD;
      differences in genomic variations between the PLP and the non-PLP patients will be analyzed.&#xD;
      An extreme subset of PLP patients will be tested for their quantitative sensory function and&#xD;
      profiled gene expression and epigenetic pattern with the Affymetrix Human Exon ST 1.0 and&#xD;
      Illumina Genome Analyzer IIx. These integrative genomic analyses using genetic variations,&#xD;
      gene expression and epigenetic profile could explain why some amputees experience chronic PLP&#xD;
      and some do not. By studying these responses in patient samples, we will evaluate the role of&#xD;
      genomic factors in PLP. SNP frequencies, gene expression and epigenetic profiles between PLP&#xD;
      and non-PLP groups will be analyzed.&#xD;
