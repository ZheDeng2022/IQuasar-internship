    <textblock>
      When considering 1st line gefitinib treatment for NSCLC, the investigators need epidermal&#xD;
      growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutational status of the tumor. But most patients do not give&#xD;
      us such information at the time of diagnosis, because it requires tumor tissue and some time&#xD;
      period for EGFR examination. So, investigators develop a protocol of 1st line gefitinib&#xD;
      treatment for NSCLC according to FDG-PET response. If a patient shows 20% or more decrease of&#xD;
      peak standard uptake value (SUV) after 1 week's gefitinib treatment, he or she will be&#xD;
      continued the treatment. If a patient shows less than 20% decrease of SUV, he or she will be&#xD;
      switched to other chemotherapy.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Gefitinib has anti-tumor activity as a result of EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibition, reducing&#xD;
      multiple downstream signaling processes that activate cell proliferation and other cell&#xD;
      responses, including cell migration angiogenesis, and reduced apoptosis. Recently, it has&#xD;
      been approved for the first line treatment of advanced NSCLC that harbors EGFR mutation. In&#xD;
      IPASS trial, tumors with EGFR mutation produced 71.2% of clinical response to first line&#xD;
      gefitinib while tumors with wild type EGFR showed only 1.1% of response. Therefore, patient&#xD;
      selection is critical for the clinical use of EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors as first line&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When considering 1st line gefitinib treatment for NSCLC, we need EGFR mutational status of&#xD;
      the tumor. But most patients do not give us such information at the time of diagnosis,&#xD;
      because it requires tumor tissue and some time period for EGFR examination. So, we need other&#xD;
      strategies such as using PET scan for early prediction of response to gefitinib.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Glucose metabolic activity closely reflects responses to gefitinib therapy. In preclinical&#xD;
      study with gefitinib sensitive cell lines, there was a dramatic decrease in FDG uptake as&#xD;
      early as 2 hours after treatment. And these metabolic alterations preceded changes in cell&#xD;
      cycle distribution, thymidine uptake and apoptosis. In contrast, gefitinib resistant cells&#xD;
      exhibited no measurable changes in FDG uptake, either in cell culture or in vivo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The strategy using FDG-PET may guide us to perform 1st line geftinib. Recently investigators&#xD;
      reported that FLT-PET or FDG-PET could predict response to EGFR tyrosine kinase (TKI) early&#xD;
      after 1 week of treatment. And % decrease more than 20% of maximum SUV of main lesion after 1&#xD;
      week of EGFR TKI treatment could predict response to that drug. More than 20% decrease of SUV&#xD;
      is a significant change during reproducibility test and also considered as a criteria for&#xD;
      response prediction of paclitaxel/cisplatin chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      So, investigators develop a protocol of 1st line gefitinib treatment for NSCLC according to&#xD;
      FDG-PET response. And if the patient showed less than 20% decrease of peak SUV, investigators&#xD;
      will stop gefitinib and treat him or her with the regimen of pemetrexed/cisplatin.&#xD;

    <description>After a baseline 18F FDG-PET, patients are treated with gefitinib 250mg/d as 1st line treatment for 7 days. And follow up 18F-FDG PET image is acquired after 1 week's treatment of gefitinib (with window period +/- 2 days).&#xD;
If % decrease of peak SUV of main lesion is 20% or more, gefitinib treatment is continued till progression, unacceptable toxicities or patient's refusal. But if % decrease of peak SUV of main lesion less than 20% or peak SUV increase, gefitinib treatment is stopped, and changed to Pemetrexed/Cisplatin chemotherapy.</description>
