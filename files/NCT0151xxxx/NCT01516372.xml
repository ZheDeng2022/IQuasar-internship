  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This will be a randomized, double-blind, placebo- controlled cross-over study to investigate&#xD;
      the effect of GEn on cardiac repolarisation parameters compared with placebo and a positive&#xD;
      control, moxifloxacin. Approximately 52 subjects will be recruited to the study and will take&#xD;
      part in four dosing sessions. Subjects will receive, in a randomized order, a single dose of&#xD;
      1200 mg GEn, 6000 mg GEn (supratherapeutic dose), 400 mg moxifloxacin (positive control) and&#xD;
      placebo. Twelve lead continuous ECG monitoring will be conducted from pre-dose to&#xD;
      approximately 24 hours after dosing on Day 1 of each study session. The primary comparison of&#xD;
      interest will be the mean change from baseline in the time-matched differences in QTcF&#xD;
      between each GEn treatment and placebo.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a 4-period, randomized, active-and placebo-controlled, double-dummy, double-blind&#xD;
      cross-over study to evaluate the effect of single doses of GEn on cardiac conduction&#xD;
      parameters in healthy subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening will occur within approximately 28 days of the first scheduled dose of study&#xD;
      medication. Each subject will participate in 4 dosing sessions at least one week apart. Prior&#xD;
      to dosing in each period, the investigator will review the scheduled assessments to confirm&#xD;
      the subject's suitability for the study including review of study entry criteria and&#xD;
      lifestyle restrictions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All subjects will receive single doses of GEn 1200 mg, GEn 6000 mg, moxifloxacin 400 mg and&#xD;
      placebo in a randomized sequence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dosing with moxifloxacin will be in the fasted state and GEn will be administered following a&#xD;
      standard meal. A double dummy approach will be used to maintain blinding. Thus, on each&#xD;
      dosing day, moxifloxacin or moxifloxacin placebo will be administered in the fasted state in&#xD;
      the morning and GEn or matched placebo will be administered 2 hours later after a standard&#xD;
      meal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During each treatment period, subjects will report to the clinical research unit the day&#xD;
      before dosing (Day 1) and will remain until completion of the last assessment on Day 2.&#xD;
      Twelve-lead ECGs including continuous Holter monitoring, clinical laboratory safety tests,&#xD;
      vital sign measurements, physical examinations, adverse event reports, and pharmacokinetic&#xD;
      samples will be collected throughout the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In each study period, cardiac conduction will be measured using a 24-hour continuous 12-lead&#xD;
      Holter monitor from the morning of Day 1 until the morning of Day 2. Extraction of the Holter&#xD;
      monitor data in triplicate for analysis will begin on Day 1 at timepoints indicated in the&#xD;
      Time and Events Table (Section 4.7). These timepoints were selected to cover the Cmax of both&#xD;
      moxifloxacin and GEn. If no clinically significant abnormalities are noted, subjects will be&#xD;
      discharged from the clinical research unit after the completion of all assessments on Day 2&#xD;
      in each period. A minimum 7-day washout period will separate each treatment period. A&#xD;
      follow-up visit will be conducted approximately 7 to 14 days after administration of the last&#xD;
      dose of study medication in treatment period 4&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Healthy as determined by a responsible physician, based on a medical evaluation&#xD;
             including medical history, physical examination, laboratory tests and ECG. A subject&#xD;
             with a clinical abnormality or laboratory parameters outside the reference range for&#xD;
             the population being studied may be included only if the Investigator and the GSK&#xD;
             Medical Monitor agree that the finding is unlikely to introduce additional risk&#xD;
             factors and will not interfere with the study procedures&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Male or female between 18 and 50 years of age inclusive, at the time of signing the&#xD;
             informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A female subject is eligible to participate if she is of: Non-childbearing potential&#xD;
             defined as pre-menopausal females with a documented tubal ligation or hysterectomy; or&#xD;
             postmenopausal defined as 12 months of spontaneous amenorrhea [in questionable cases a&#xD;
             blood sample with simultaneous follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) greater than 40&#xD;
             MlU/ml and estradiol less than 40 pg/ml (less than 147 pmol/L) is confirmatory].&#xD;
             Females on hormone replacement therapy (HRT) and whose menopausal status is in doubt&#xD;
             will be required to use one of the contraception methods in Section 8.1 if they wish&#xD;
             to continue their HRT during the study. Otherwise, they must discontinue HRT to allow&#xD;
             confirmation of post-menopausal status prior to study enrollment. For most forms of&#xD;
             HRT, at least 2-4 weeks will elapse between the cessation of therapy and the blood&#xD;
             draw; this interval depends on the type and dosage of HRT. Following confirmation of&#xD;
             their post-menopausal status, they can resume use of HRT during the study without use&#xD;
             of a contraceptive method; Child-bearing potential and agrees to use one of the&#xD;
             contraception methods listed in the protocol for an appropriate period of time (as&#xD;
             determined by the product label or investigator) prior to the start of dosing to&#xD;
             sufficiently minimize the risk of pregnancy at that point. Female subjects must agree&#xD;
             to use contraception until the follow-up visit is completed.&#xD;

             using the equation of Cockcroft and Gault. See study procedure manual for details on&#xD;
             creatinine clearance calculations.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  AST, ALT, alkaline phosphatase and bilirubin less than and equal to 1.5xULN (isolated&#xD;
             bilirubin greater than and equal to 1.5xULN is acceptable if bilirubin is fractionated&#xD;
