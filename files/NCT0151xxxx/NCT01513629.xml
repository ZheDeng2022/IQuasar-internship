  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Autism spectrum disorders (ASD) is a highly hereditary neuropsychiatric disorder. In children&#xD;
      and adolescents worldwide, the prevalence of ASD is estimated at 0.6%. Understanding the&#xD;
      biological mechanism of this disorder could potentially facilitate prompt, accurate and&#xD;
      personalized therapy. The dysfunction of fronto-temporal circuitry may explain language&#xD;
      impairment in ASD. In addition, pieces of evidence suggest that the abnormality of the&#xD;
      cortico-striato-thalamic circuitry might be related to social deficits. However, very little&#xD;
      is known how changes in these two circuitries are related to variation in genotypes. Previous&#xD;
      reports on ASD using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) have demonstrated alteration of brain&#xD;
      structure. Recent advance in neuroimaging has shown that structural connectivity of a&#xD;
      specific circuitry is superior to regional analysis in terms of higher penetrance of genetic&#xD;
      effects and better account for behavioral variance. Therefore, it is plausible that&#xD;
      connectivity imaging may serve as effective endophenotypes that link clinical manifestation&#xD;
      (phenotypes) and the biological variables (genotypes). In the past five years, our lab has&#xD;
      established world leading diffusion spectrum imaging techniques, and applied the techniques&#xD;
      to clinical studies on ASD, schizophrenia, stroke and epilepsy. The clinical experience and&#xD;
      technical strengths provide a strong basis for us to extend to imaging genetics, aiming to&#xD;
      determine effective endophenotypes of ASD. Therefore, the goal of this project is to validate&#xD;
      structural connectivity of fronto-temporal and cortico-striato-thalamic circuitries as&#xD;
      effective imaging endophenotypes of ASD. Specifically, the investigators will achieve the&#xD;
      goal through a series of validation. First, the investigators will demonstrate that&#xD;
      structural connectivities in the two targeted circuitries are indeed different among groups&#xD;
      of patients with ASD, unaffected siblings, and neurotypicals. Second, the investigators will&#xD;
      demonstrate in neurotypicals and unaffected siblings that the altered structural&#xD;
      connectivities related to social and language impairments are indeed different in carriers of&#xD;
      risk genes, i.e. CNTNAP2 and SLC25A12, respectively. Last, the investigators will demonstrate&#xD;
      in all participants that the altered structural connectivities are associated with the&#xD;
      corresponding behavioral variances in social and language function. This two-year project is&#xD;
      a cohort study consisting of three groups, namely patient, unaffected siblings, and control&#xD;
      groups matched in age, gender and handedness. The patient and sibling groups consist of 20&#xD;
      boys each, age 10-15 years old, and the control group consists of 40 boys. The examination&#xD;
      includes behavior assessment (IQ test, neuropsychological and clinical assessment), MRI study&#xD;
      (structure MRI and diffusion spectrum imaging for structural connectivity) and genome&#xD;
      scan(specifically candidate genes related to language function, i.e. SLC25A12, and to social&#xD;
      function, i.e. CNTNAP2). In conclusion, this is the first cohort project on imaging genetics&#xD;
      in Taiwan. The success of this project will facilitate the progress of translational&#xD;
      neuroscience in Taiwan. The methodology of validating endophenotype will be readily extended&#xD;
      to other psychiatric diseases.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  20 males, right handed, age 10-15 years old. Diagnosis of high-functioning autism is&#xD;
             made according to the DSM-IV and ICD-10 criteria by senior child psychiatrists&#xD;
             experienced in autism assessments and treatments. The patients should have full-scale&#xD;
             IQ â‰§ 80 and no comorbid diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  20 unaffected (discordant) male siblings of patients with high-functioning autism&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  40 healthy school boys without any psychiatric disorders in the 1st and 2nd degree&#xD;
             relatives. The patient group (N=20) and a neurotypical group (N=20) are matched in&#xD;
             age,gender and handedness. The family group (N=20) and another neurotypical group&#xD;
             (N=20) are matched in age, gender and handedness.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  full-scale IQ &lt; 80 and with comorbid diseases&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  large imaging motion artifact&#xD;
