    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, multicenter, comparative, parallel-group, observational study. There&#xD;
      will be 2 cohorts according to pre-transplant dialysis modality (hemodialysis or peritoneal&#xD;
      dialysis). In each cohort, subjects will be observed for 12 months. Approximately, 1040&#xD;
      subjects will be enrolled from 8 transplant centers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be enrolled consecutively until the number of subjects in peritoneal dialysis&#xD;
      group has been 260. It will take 2 years. In this period, the number of subject in&#xD;
      hemodialysis group enrolled in this study will be 780. After finishing the observation of all&#xD;
      subjects, to balance clinical and demographic baseline characteristics between the two&#xD;
      groups, subjects will be selected in each cohort with 1:1 matched using propensity score&#xD;
      method. And then primary and secondary endpoints will be compared between two groups.&#xD;

      1. STUDY OBJECTIVES AND ENDPOINTS 1.1. Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of this study is:&#xD;
&#xD;
      • To compare the incidence of composite outcomes (delayed graft function, functional delayed&#xD;
      graft function, primary nonfunction, biopsy-proven acute rejection) of pre-transplant&#xD;
      dialysis modality hemodialysis versus peritoneal in recipients of first renal allografts at 1&#xD;
      year posttransplant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objectives of this study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To compare the incidence of delayed graft function and functional delayed graft function&#xD;
           of pre-transplant dialysis modality hemodialysis versus peritoneal in recipients of&#xD;
           first renal allografts at 1 year posttransplant;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To compare the incidence of composite outcomes biopsy-proven acute rejection of&#xD;
           pre-transplant dialysis modality hemodialysis versus peritoneal in recipients of first&#xD;
           renal allografts at 1 year posttransplant;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To compare the incidence of primary nonfunction of pre-transplant dialysis modality&#xD;
           hemodialysis versus peritoneal in recipients of first renal allografts at 1 year&#xD;
           posttransplant;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the effect of hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis on graft function in terms&#xD;
           of longitudinal change of eGFR calculated with abbreviated MDRD equation at Weeks 8, 16,&#xD;
           24, 32, 40, and 48 after renal transplant;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To compare the incidence and the duration of hospitalization after kidney&#xD;
           transplantation of pre-transplant dialysis modality hemodialysis versus peritoneal in&#xD;
           recipients of first renal allografts at 1 year posttransplant;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To compare the graft loss and subject death rate of pre-transplant dialysis modality&#xD;
           hemodialysis versus peritoneal in recipients of first renal allografts at 1 year&#xD;
           posttransplant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      1.2. Endpoints&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary endpoint:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Composite outcome including;&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Delayed graft function (defined as the need for dialysis in the first week after&#xD;
                transplantation)&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Functional DGF (defined as the absence of a decrease in serum creatinine level by a&#xD;
                minimum of 10% per day during 3 consecutive days in the first postoperative week,&#xD;
                not including patients in whom acute rejection, calcineurin inhibitor toxicity, or&#xD;
                both, developed within the first week&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Primary nonfunction (defined as the kidney never achieving function after&#xD;
                transplantation)&#xD;
&#xD;
             4. Biopsy proven acute rejection (defined as scute rejection, confirmed by allograft&#xD;
                biopsy)&#xD;
&#xD;
                Secondary endpoints:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  eGFR (calculated with abbreviated MDRD equation at Weeks 8, 16, 24, 32, 40 and 48 after&#xD;
           renal transplant)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Hospitalization after kidney transplant (any cause, duration)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Delayed graft function, functional DGF, Primary nonfunction, biopsy proven acute&#xD;
           rejection (definition of each endpoint is described above)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Graft loss (return to long-term dialysis)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Subject death (any cause)&#xD;
