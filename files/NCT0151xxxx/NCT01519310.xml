      The purpose of this study is to see if intestinal bacteria plays a role in choline metabolism&#xD;
      (a form of choline monitored in this study is called phosphatidylcholine, also known as&#xD;
      lecithin). This study will help to determine if choline metabolism is affected by short-term&#xD;
      antibiotic therapy, and/or can be altered by probiotic therapy (e.g. in the form of eating&#xD;
      yogurt).&#xD;

      The purpose of this study is to see if intestinal bacteria plays a role in choline metabolism&#xD;
      (a form of choline monitored in this study is called phosphatidylcholine, also known as&#xD;
      lecithin). This study will help to determine if choline metabolism is affected by short-term&#xD;
      antibiotic therapy, and/or can be altered by probiotic therapy (e.g. in the form of eating&#xD;
      yogurt).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Metabolism is a process that turns foods we eat into fuel for our bodies. Choline is nutrient&#xD;
      found in a type of fat commonly found in foods. There is evidence that choline metabolism by&#xD;
      bacteria in the intestines may be linked to cardiac risk.&#xD;

      The purpose of this study is to see if intestinal bacteria plays a role in choline metabolism&#xD;
      (a form of choline monitored in this study is called phosphatidylcholine, also known as&#xD;
      lecithin). This study will help to determine if choline metabolism is affected by short-term&#xD;
      antibiotic therapy, and/or can be altered by probiotic therapy (e.g. in the form of eating&#xD;
      yogurt).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This single center study will randomize 30 normal, healthy volunteers to 1 of 3 groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 1: antibiotics for 1 week, followed by probiotics for 3 weeks; Group 2: antibiotics for&#xD;
      1 week, followed by no probiotics for 3 weeks. Group 3: no antibiotics for 1 week, followed&#xD;
      by probiotics for 3 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The antibiotics to be used will be metronidazole (500 mg twice daily) and ciprofloxacin (500&#xD;
      mg daily) for one week. The probiotics to be used will be one serving size of standard&#xD;
      flavored yogurt (approximately 170 g) twice daily for up to three weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study visits will occur at baseline, 1 week, and 4 weeks. Blood and urine samples will be&#xD;
      collected at the start of each visit. Subjects will then eat 2 hard boiled eggs and be given&#xD;
      a standard medical isotope. Additional blood samples will be obtained at 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6&#xD;
      hours, and a urine sample will be collected at 6 hours. Samples will be analyzed for choline&#xD;
      levels, its byproducts, and isotope levels.&#xD;
