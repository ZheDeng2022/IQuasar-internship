      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - People who have some kinds of cancer can benefit from donated bone marrow stem cells. These&#xD;
      stem cells help produce healthy bone marrow and slow or stop the spread of abnormal cells.&#xD;
      However, stem cells transplants do not always work. Also, they may have serious side effects&#xD;
      that can cause illness or death. The Bone Marrow Stem Cell Transplant Program is studying&#xD;
      methods to make stem cell transplant procedures safer and more effective.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To test a new procedure that may improve the success and decrease the side effects of stem&#xD;
      cell transplants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Individuals 10 to 75 years of age who have a life-threatening illness that may require a&#xD;
           stem cell transplant.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Healthy siblings who are able to provide stem cells for transplant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be screened with a medical history, physical exam, and blood and urine&#xD;
           tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Donor procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Stem cell donors will start by having apheresis to donate white blood cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Donors will receive filgrastim shots for 5 days to help move stem cells into the blood&#xD;
           for collection.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Donors will have another round of apheresis to donate the stem cells for transplant.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Recipient procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Before the transplant, recipients will have radiation twice a day for 3 days and&#xD;
           chemotherapy for 7 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  After the radiation and chemotherapy, recipients will receive the stem cells provided by&#xD;
           the donor.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  After the transplant, recipients will receive the white blood cells provided by the&#xD;
           donor.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Recipients will be monitored closely for 4 months to study the success of the&#xD;
           transplant. They will have more followup visits at least yearly thereafter.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Recipients will have a research apheresis prior to transplant and at 3 months.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Peripheral blood stem cell transplant research carried out by the NHLBI BMT Unit focus on&#xD;
      transplant techniques designed to decrease graft versus host disease (GVHD), increase the&#xD;
      graft-versus-leukemia (GVL) effect and reduce the risk of post-transplant graft rejection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Through incremental transplant clinical trials we have shown that by controlling the stem&#xD;
      cell (CD34+ cell) and T lymphocyte (CD3+ cell) dose, severe GVHD can be reduced whilst&#xD;
      beneficial GVL effects can be preserved. We found that T cell depleted transplants using the&#xD;
      Nexell/Baxter Isolex 300i system and subsequently, the Miltenyi CD34+ CliniMACs system to&#xD;
      obtain high CD34+ doses depleted of lymphocytes were safe to administer and associated with&#xD;
      less severe acute GVHD and promising response rates and overall survival. Our previous trials&#xD;
      have helped us to create the transplant environment (significant lymphodepletion and minimal&#xD;
      post transplant immunosuppression) that make for an ideal platform for adoptive cellular&#xD;
      immunotherapy&#xD;
&#xD;
      This protocol is designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of an improved ex vivo graft&#xD;
      manipulation procedure using the Miltenyi CliniMACs CD 34, 3 and 19 selection system in&#xD;
      HLA-matched sibling allogeneic peripheral blood stem cell transplant. The manipulation of the&#xD;
      graft is the primary research intervention and all other aspects of clinical management on&#xD;
      this protocol are the standard of care. The target CD34+ dose range will be 3 times 10(6)/kg&#xD;
      to 10 times 10(6)/kg and the target CD3+ dose range will be 5 x 10(4)/kg to 1 times 10(6)/kg.&#xD;
      The technique will preserve greater numbers of NK cells. Once we demonstrate adequacy of&#xD;
      engraftment in the first ten recipients, we plan an amendment to permit further use of this&#xD;
      protocol to serve as a platform for several planned adoptive cellular therapy initiatives.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The protocol will accrue up to 44 subjects aged 10-75 with a hematological malignancy and&#xD;
      their HLA-matched sibling donors, in whom allogeneic stem cell transplantation from an&#xD;
      HLA-matched sibling would be routinely indicated. Diagnostic categories will include acute&#xD;
      and chronic leukemia, myelodysplastic syndromes, lymphomas, multiple myeloma and&#xD;
      myeloproliferative syndromes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will receive a myeloablative conditioning regimen of cyclophosphamide (120 mg/kg&#xD;
      total), fludarabine (125 mg/m(2) total) and total body irradiation (1200 cGy with lung&#xD;
      shielding to 600 cGy), followed by an infusion of a stem cell product prepared using the&#xD;
      Miltenyi CliniMACS system for CD34, 3 &amp; 19 selection. Older subjects will receive a lower&#xD;
      dose of irradiation (600 cGy) without lung shielding to reduce the regimen intensity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The overall objective is to assess the feasibility of using this system as a platform for&#xD;
      cellular immunotherapy initiatives. The primary study endpoint will be overall survival at&#xD;
      day plus 200. Non-relapse mortality at day plus 200 will be monitored for safety. Secondary&#xD;
      endpoints will be standard transplant outcome variables such as non-hematologic toxicity,&#xD;
      incidence and severity of acute and chronic GVHD and relapse of disease.&#xD;
