  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      For most women, the most significant pain they will experience is the pain associated with&#xD;
      childbirth. Up to one-third of women experience &quot;back labor&quot;, this typically occurs when the&#xD;
      fetus assumes varying degrees of malposition, especially the occiput posterior position, and&#xD;
      causes additional constant pressure against the maternal spine and pelvis. &quot;Back labor&quot;&#xD;
      presents as constant pain, that occurs even between contractions. It is often difficult to&#xD;
      manage, by the patient, the obstetrician, and the anesthesiologist, and may increase the rate&#xD;
      of instrumental and caesarian delivery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Epidural anesthesia/analgesia is the most common and effective intervention used to help&#xD;
      women cope with labor pain. Dilute concentrations of local anesthetic and opioid provide&#xD;
      complete analgesia for most women. Some women, however, have breakthrough pain, often due to&#xD;
      &quot;back labor,&quot; and require more concentrated drug solutions. This increases the side effects&#xD;
      associated with these drugs (e.g., hypotension, pruritus, motor block), thus treatment of&#xD;
      this pain poses a challenge for the anesthesiologist and the obstetrician.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sterile water injections (SWI) are a simple and well-established method of managing labor&#xD;
      pain among midwives. This intervention was first used to alleviate pain associated with&#xD;
      kidney stones, and was introduced to obstetrics in the 1970s. Using a syringe, small amounts&#xD;
      of sterile water is deposited subcutaneously near the sacral area. The sterile water causes&#xD;
      osmotic and mechanical irritation resulting in a brief (15-30 second) and significant&#xD;
      stinging sensation. The onset of pain relief follows almost immediately and may last for up&#xD;
      to two hours. The procedure can be repeated a number of times.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sterile water for pain management is most often administered using four intracutaneous&#xD;
      injections: two sites lateral to the lumbosacral spine and two sites 2-3 cm below and 1-2 cm&#xD;
      medial to the original two injection sites. 0.1 mL of sterile water is injected between the&#xD;
      dermal layers to raise a small bleb on the skin surface at each of the four sites. In labor,&#xD;
      the injections are administered sequentially during a uterine contraction, with the series of&#xD;
      four injections, performed two at a time, completed within 20-30 seconds.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that the use of sterile water injections in women with&#xD;
      neuraxial analgesia with breakthrough pain will result in decreased local anesthetic&#xD;
      requirements and increase patient satisfaction.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Since it is assumed that the neuraxial anesthetic is placed prior to transition to active&#xD;
      phase of labor, the patient will receive the intervention when they report breakthrough pain.&#xD;
      Prior to administration of the intervention, the adequacy of the existing neuraxial&#xD;
      anesthetic will be verified as bilateral decreased discrimination to cold from T8 to the&#xD;
      sacrum. Four tuberculin syringes, each containing 0.1 mL of the assigned solution labeled&#xD;
      &quot;study drug&quot; will be prepared. Patients allocated to the study group will receive sterile&#xD;
      water, and those allocated to the control group will receive sterile normal saline solution.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The area to be injected will be prepared with chlorhexidine wipes to ensure sterility. In the&#xD;
      sitting position, study subjects will receive a total of 0.4 mL of &quot;study drug&quot; via four&#xD;
      injections: bilateral injections at the posterior superior iliac spine on and bilateral&#xD;
      injections at 1 cm medial and 1-2 cm inferior to the first point.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be asked to rate their overall labor pain using a 0-100 mm visual analog scale&#xD;
      (VAS) for pain prior to study drug administration and every 30 minutes until commencement of&#xD;
      pushing. They will also be asked to specifically rate low back pain with the VAS. Analgesia&#xD;
      administration data from the time of study drug injection, including maintenance epidural&#xD;
      solution volume, time of first patient controlled epidural analgesia (PCEA) bolus request,&#xD;
      number of PCEA bolus requests and delivered doses, total PCEA bupivacaine dose, time to first&#xD;
      request for manual rebolus, number of manual bolus doses, manual bolus bupivacaine dose,&#xD;
      total bupivacaine dose and total fentanyl dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additional recorded data will include maternal age, height, weight, cervical dilation at&#xD;
      initiation of neuraxial analgesia and at study drug administration, duration of labor&#xD;
      (initiation of analgesia to delivery), maximum oxytocin infusion rate during labor, and mode&#xD;
      of delivery. A &quot;total labor pain score&quot; will be assessed approximately 60 minute after&#xD;
      delivery, as well as satisfaction with labor analgesia using a 100-mm VAS.&#xD;
