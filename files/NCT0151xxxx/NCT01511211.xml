  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a double blinded randomized controlled trial on the effect on duration of action when&#xD;
      we add dexamethasone to our 3 routine peripheral nerve blocks (femoral, obturator and sciatic&#xD;
      nerve) for total knee replacement surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Technique:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A computer generated randomization will determine if dexamethasone 8mg (2 cc of 4mg/cc) will&#xD;
      be given to the patient intravenously or mixed with the ropivacaine for the lower limb&#xD;
      blocks. A sham 2 ml of normal saline will be given in the other route. For example, if the&#xD;
      patient is assigned to the Ropivacaine + Dexamethasone Combination arm, 2 ml of dexamethasone&#xD;
      will be drawn up and labeled &quot;PNB&quot; (peripheral nerve block) by a person not involved in the&#xD;
      block or anesthetic management of the patient and given to the regional anesthesiologist to&#xD;
      add to their local anesthetic solution. Another 2 ml of normal saline labeled (IV) will be&#xD;
      drawn up by the same person and the sham will be given to the anesthesia team taking care of&#xD;
      the patient during surgery for them to give it to the patient intravenously just before the&#xD;
      start of the surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Alternatively, if the patient is assigned to the Ropivacaine-Only Block arm, a person not&#xD;
      involved in the patient care will draw up 2 ml of normal saline and label it &quot;PNB&quot; and give&#xD;
      it to the regional anesthesiologist and 2ml of dexamethasone and label it &quot;IV&quot; to the&#xD;
      anesthesia team taking care of the patient during surgery for them to give it to the patient&#xD;
      intravenously just before the start of surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization:&#xD;
&#xD;
      70 patients will be randomly selected to receive either:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Combo A = 38 cc of 0.5% Ropivacaine with 2 cc of 4mg/cc Dexamethasone in the lower limb&#xD;
           blocks PLUS 2cc normal saline intravenously. 15 cc of solution will be used for the&#xD;
           femoral block, 20 cc for the popliteal block and 5 cc will be used for the obturator&#xD;
           block.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Combo B = 38 cc of 0.5% Ropivacaine with 2 cc of saline in the lower limb block PLUS 2cc&#xD;
           of 4mg/cc of Dexamethasone intravenously. 15 cc of solution will be used for the femoral&#xD;
           block, 20 cc for the popliteal block and 5 cc will be used for the obturator block.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blinding:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A sealed envelope will be given to an anesthesia provider not involved in the peripheral&#xD;
      nerve block, follow up assessment of the block or provide perioperative anesthesia care to&#xD;
      the patient. This person would draw up 2 cc of dexamethasone and 2 cc of normal saline and&#xD;
      label them for intravenous (IV) injection or addition to the ropivacaine mixture in the lower&#xD;
      limb block (PNB) depending on the instructions in the envelope.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The anesthesia provider performing the peripheral nerve block, providing perioperative&#xD;
      anesthesia care including the general anesthesia or monitored anesthesia care nor the&#xD;
      anesthesia providers assessing the patients block will not have information regarding the&#xD;
      route of dexamethasone given.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Block performance:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All blocks are to be performed by 1 of our 7 regional anesthesiologists with expertise in&#xD;
      ultrasound-guided lower limb blocks who will be blinded to the presence of dexamethasone to&#xD;
      the local anesthetic. Blinding the performer will help to eliminate performance bias. Two 20&#xD;
      cc syringes of 0.5% ropivacaine will be prepared for the block. One cc of the study drug will&#xD;
      be injected into each syringe and mixed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before nerve blockade, all patients will receive intravenous access and standard monitoring,&#xD;
      which included noninvasive blood pressure, electrocardiogram, and pulse oximetry.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sedation and anxiolysis are achieved with intravenously administered midazolam in 1- to 2-mg&#xD;
      increments up to 5 mg and fentanyl in 25 ug increments as needed up to 250 ug.&#xD;
&#xD;
      POPLITEAL NERVE BLOCK&#xD;
&#xD;
      Popliteal nerve block will be performed with the patient lying supine and the operative leg&#xD;
      propped up on an elevation pillow allowing the posterior popliteal fossa to be accessed. A&#xD;
      linear, high-frequency US probe of 5 to 12 MHz (S-nerve, sonosite) covered with a sterile&#xD;
      dressing will be placed in the popliteal fossa in a transverse plane. The tibial and common&#xD;
      peroneal nerve are identified superficial and lateral to the popliteal vessels then traced&#xD;
      cephalad until they unite. This is the point of needle placement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After sterilization and application of LA (3ml of 0.5% lidocaine) to the skin, a 22-gauge,&#xD;
      Tuohy is advanced through the skin at the lateral border thigh in alignment with the long&#xD;
      axis of the ultrasound probe in the same plane as the US beam (ie, in-plane technique). The&#xD;
      needle is to be positioned under US guidance to the tibial nerve and common peroneal nerve.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The needle is to be always visualized before LA injection. Hydrolocation or dissection beyond&#xD;
      3 cc is not to be used to avoid dilution effect. Once needle position was satisfactory and&#xD;
      after negative aspiration, 10 mL of LA is to be injected incrementally over 2 minutes with&#xD;
      direct sonographic visualization of the LA spread around the tibial nerve. The needle is to&#xD;
      be repositioned under US guidance to ensure adequate spread of LA around the tibial nerve. A&#xD;
      circumferential spread of the LA is sought. Extra care is taken never to inject within the&#xD;
      nerve. Expansion and compartmentalization of the nerve structure will result in abandonment&#xD;
      of the study. Similarly, 10 ml of LA is injected circumferentially around the common peroneal&#xD;
      nerve.&#xD;
&#xD;
      FEMORAL NERVE BLOCK&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. A femoral nerve block is placed in the usual manner of our institutional practice.&#xD;
           Femoral nerve block will be performed with the patient lying supine. A linear,&#xD;
           high-frequency US probe of 5 to 12 MHz (S-nerve, sonosite) covered with a sterile&#xD;
           dressing will be placed on the inguinal crease in a transverse plane. The femoral artery&#xD;
           is identified and traced cephalad until the profundus branch joins the femoral artery&#xD;
           proper. This is the level of needle placement.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. After sterilization and application of LA (3ml of 1% lidocaine) to the skin, a 19-gauge,&#xD;
           Tuohy is advanced through the skin at the lateral border of the upper thigh in alignment&#xD;
           with the long axis of the ultrasound probe in the same plane as the US beam (ie,&#xD;
           in-plane technique). The needle is to be positioned under US guidance to the lateral and&#xD;
           anterior portion of the femoral nerve.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. The needle is to be always visualized before LA injection. No more than 3cc of&#xD;
           hydrolocation or hydrodissection is allowed. Once needle position was satisfactory and&#xD;
           after negative aspiration, a 20 mL syringe containing 20 mL of LA where 10mL is to be&#xD;
           injected incrementally over 3 minutes with direct sonographic visualization of the LA&#xD;
           spread. The needle is to be repositioned under the femoral nerve US guidance to ensure&#xD;
           adequate spread of LA above the nerves using the remaining 5 mL of LA. A circumferential&#xD;
           spread of the LA is sought. Extra care is taken never to inject within the nerve.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OBTURATOR NERVE BLOCK The single shot obturator nerve block is performed with the patient&#xD;
      lying supine with the leg slightly abducted and flexed at the hip joint. The same ultrasound&#xD;
      probe is used and positioned more medially to locate the fascial plane between the adductor&#xD;
      brevis and adductor magnus where the posterior division of the obturator nerve lies. After&#xD;
      local infiltration of the skin with 3cc of 1% lidocaine, a 22 G Tuohy needle is advanced in&#xD;
      plane with until it lies within the fascial plane of the adductor magnus and adductor brevis.&#xD;
      No more than 3 cc of hydrolocation or hydrodissection is allowed. 5 cc of ropivacaine is&#xD;
      injected here taking care that hydrodissection of the fascial plane occurs and avoiding&#xD;
      intramuscular injection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      INTRAOP General anesthesia is performed in the usual fashion. Fentanyl is used&#xD;
      intraoperatively if the heart rate or blood pressure deviated greater than 20% from the&#xD;
      baseline if deemed appropriate. No other opioid or analgesics (such as ketorolac or ketamine)&#xD;
      will be given as per institutional practice. If there is suspicion that the blocks are not&#xD;
      working intraoperatively, the patient may be withdrawn from the study and alternative&#xD;
      analgesia may be given. The dexamethasone or sham is given at the beginning of the surgery&#xD;
      and ondansetron 4 mg is given at the end of surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      POST-ANESTHESIA CARE UNIT In PACU, the patient is evaluated for femoral, sciatic and&#xD;
      obturator block success. If any of the 3 blocks are deemed non functional, the patient is&#xD;
      withdrawn from the study and noted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patient will be given hydromorphone 0.2mg IV boluses in PACU to maintain the VAS score&#xD;
      below 4 if necessary. The standard institutional hydromorphone PCA set at 0.2mg bolus every&#xD;
      10 minutes with no basal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the time of discharge from PACU, the patients are given a diary to record their perception&#xD;
      of sensation and movement every awake hour on a scale of 0 to 2. Zero being no sensation, 1 =&#xD;
      some sensation and 2 being full sensation being recorded separately on top of the foot and on&#xD;
      the bottom of the foot. Similarly a 0 to 2 scale for strength. 0 being no movement, 1= some&#xD;
      movement, 2 = full strength in pointing the toes towards the nose and in pointing the toes&#xD;
      away from the nose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will also be given instructions to record the location of their pain when it first&#xD;
      returns and each time they require pain medications; being on top or at the bottom of the&#xD;
      knee.&#xD;
&#xD;
      FOLLOW UP All patients will be be seen the day after the surgery for their time to first&#xD;
      return of sensation and time to first return of movement. Also information regarding the full&#xD;
      return of sensation and time to full return of movement is obtained. If sensory and motor&#xD;
      function remains intact, a further interview will be conducted daily until full sensory and&#xD;
      motor function returns. All complications will be noted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will have their PCA and medication records checked for the time of their first&#xD;
      request for analgesia. Patients will be interviewed on the location of their pain for this&#xD;
      request for analgesia if the patient's pain location record is ambiguous.&#xD;
