    <measure>Percentage of Pre-Treatment Images Correctly Identified by Reviewers</measure>
    <time_frame>16 weeks post-treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Change in the treated vs. untreated areas will be assessed by observation of changes in surface contour and/or fat volume by an independent photo review of pre-treatment and post-treatment images of the treated areas. Reviewers will be practicing dermatologists or plastic surgeons. All reviewers will be blinded to post-treatment vs. baseline untreated area. The order in which images will be presented will be randomized; for each subject placement of the baseline, pre-treatment image will be randomized for each pair of subject images. Reviewers will be asked to select the baseline photos for each subject photo series and record selections on a data collection form. The expected success rate is at least 80% correct identification of pre-treatment images and the majority of physician reviewers (2 out 3) correctly identify 75% of the pre-treatment images.</description>

    <description>The number of device- or procedure related adverse events will be tabulated. Adverse event data are collected continuously throughout the study period from the time of enrollment through the 16 week follow-up visit. At the time of an AE report, each study investigator determines the relationship to the investigational device or the study procedure.</description>

    <measure>Reduction in Fat Layer Thickness in the Treated Area as Measured by Ultrasound</measure>
    <time_frame>16 week-post-treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Change in the fat layer thickness will be calculated by comparison of pre-treatment and 16 week post-treatment ultrasound measurements taken in the area treated with the device, and in the untreated lateral thigh control area. The Sponsor's standardized techniques for obtaining ultrasound imaging will be used. Overall fat layer thickness changes will be normalized for each subject by subtracting the change in the control area from the change in treated area to remove the influence of weight variations. This result is considered the treatment effect. Success is defined as, on average, at least a 1mm or greater reduction in fat layer thickness for the treated region as compared to the untreated control region. Results indicate the fat layer reduction in millimeters.</description>

&#xD;
          2. Subject has clearly visible fat on the inner thighs and in the investigator's opinion,&#xD;

&#xD;
          4. Subject with body mass index (BMI) up to 30. [BMI is defined as weight in pounds&#xD;
             multiplied by 703 divided by the square of the height in inches.]&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Subject agrees to maintain his/her weight (i.e., within 5 pounds) by not making any&#xD;
             major changes in his/her diet or lifestyle during the course of the study.&#xD;

          1. Subject has had a surgical procedure(s) in the area of intended treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Subject has had an invasive fat reduction procedure (e.g., liposuction,&#xD;
             abdominoplasty, mesotherapy) in the area of intended treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Subject has had a non-invasive fat reduction and/or body contouring procedure in the&#xD;
             area of intended treatment within the past 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Subject needs to administer, or has a known history of, subcutaneous injections (e.g.,&#xD;
             heparin, insulin) into the area of intended treatment within the past month.&#xD;

             response to cold exposure that limits blood flow to the skin.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Subject has a history of a bleeding disorder or is taking any medication that in the&#xD;

         15. Any other condition or laboratory value that would, in the professional opinion of the&#xD;
             investigator, potentially affect the subject's response or the integrity of the data,&#xD;
             or would pose an unacceptable risk to the subject.&#xD;

Reviewers will be practicing dermatologists or plastic surgeons. All reviewers will be blinded to post-treatment vs. baseline untreated area. The order in which images will be presented will be randomized; for each subject placement of the baseline, pre-treatment image will be randomized for each pair of subject images. Reviewers will be asked to select the baseline photos for each subject photo series and record selections on a data collection form. The expected success rate is at least 80% correct identification of pre-treatment images and the majority of physician reviewers (2 out 3) correctly identify 75% of the pre-treatment images.</description>

        <title>Reduction in Fat Layer Thickness in the Treated Area as Measured by Ultrasound</title>
        <description>Change in the fat layer thickness will be calculated by comparison of pre-treatment and 16 week post-treatment ultrasound measurements taken in the area treated with the device, and in the untreated lateral thigh control area. The Sponsor's standardized techniques for obtaining ultrasound imaging will be used. Overall fat layer thickness changes will be normalized for each subject by subtracting the change in the control area from the change in treated area to remove the influence of weight variations. This result is considered the treatment effect. Success is defined as, on average, at least a 1mm or greater reduction in fat layer thickness for the treated region as compared to the untreated control region. Results indicate the fat layer reduction in millimeters.</description>
