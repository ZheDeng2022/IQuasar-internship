      This study will evaluate the efficacy of IRay treatment in patients with Polypoidal Choroidal&#xD;
      Vasculopathy (PCV)secondary to AMD as determined by the change in the proportion of lesion&#xD;
      activity and lesion size at 12 months.&#xD;

      This is a single-center, interventional clinical trial in which subjects will receive 16 Gy&#xD;
      of IRay treatment and Lucentis, followed by Lucentis treatment as needed to evaluate the&#xD;
      efficacy of IRay treatment in patients with PCV as determined by the change in the proportion&#xD;

    <description>The Oraya IRay stereotactic radiotherapy device will be used to deliver a 16 Gy dose of radiation to the macula. The radiotherapy will be delivered in a single session utilizing three sequential beams, each depositing 5.3 Gy at the macula through calculated scleral entry points, crossing the pars plana region of the eye, and overlapping at the same region of the macula.</description>

&#xD;
          -  The distance from the center of the fovea to the nearest edge of the optic disc should&#xD;

             treatment.).&#xD;

             copy of the signed informed consent form.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Must have best corrected visual acuity of 75 to 25 letters (inclusive) in the study&#xD;
             eye and at least 20 letters in the fellow eye (if both eyes meet all the study&#xD;
             criteria, then the eye with the worst vision should be selected as the study eye).&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  CNV due to causes other than AMD or PCV, including ocular histoplasmosis syndrome,&#xD;

             visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Intravitreal device in the study eye.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Concomitant disease in the study eye which might interfere with the effect of&#xD;

          -  Any other condition, which in the judgment of the investigator would prevent the&#xD;
             subject from granting consent or completing the study, such as dementia, mental&#xD;
             illness (including generalized anxiety disorder, claustrophobia, etc.), or inability&#xD;

             dysfunction, any clinical finding giving reasonable suspicion of a disease or&#xD;
             condition that contraindicates the use of intravitreal ranibizumab or that might&#xD;
             affect interpretation of the results of the study or render the subject at high risk&#xD;
             for treatment complication&#xD;
