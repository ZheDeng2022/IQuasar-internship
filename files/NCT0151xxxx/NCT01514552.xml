  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In areas of the world where populations are undernourished poor oral health is prevalent.&#xD;
      Diets rich in fruit and vegetables are thought to have many health benefits including&#xD;
      reducing the risk of oral cancer or gum disease. In particular fruits such as strawberries&#xD;
      contain many different compounds which may be responsible for these proposed health benefits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      From this study, the researchers hope to gain information about how the tissues in the mouth&#xD;
      absorb strawberry gummies in a population of habitually smoking and never smoking men and&#xD;
      women. The researchers will measure inflammation hormones in your saliva and urine and the&#xD;
      genes in your mouth and blood. Two different strawberry gummies will be tested in this study.&#xD;
      The strawberry gummies were developed at OSU in the Department of Food Science and&#xD;
      Technology. One type of strawberry gummy will contain freeze-dried whole strawberries while&#xD;
      the other type will have no fruit. In total the eight pieces of strawberry gummies that you&#xD;
      will consume in one day will be at most equal to 1 cup of whole strawberries. The research&#xD;
      team believes the two strawberry gummies may be digested and absorbed differently and that&#xD;
      components in the strawberry gummies may be helpful for oral health.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Polyphenols (plant chemicals, some produce purple and red color in fruits) found in&#xD;
      strawberries have been associated with reducing the risk of gum disease. However, much of&#xD;
      these chemicals are susceptible to degradation during food processing and digestion.&#xD;
      Minimally degraded in the mouth, polyphenols when consumed as fresh fruits are retained only&#xD;
      for brief periods. Therefore, exposure of fresh fruit polyphenols to oral tissues may not be&#xD;
      adequate for a biologic effect to occur. At OSU, food scientists have developed a 6 gram&#xD;
      strawberry gummy containing 3 grams of freeze-dried strawberries designed to dissolve&#xD;
      relatively slow in the mouth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will investigate the effects of strawberry gummy consumption on oral health&#xD;
      in 36 habitually smoking and non-smoking healthy adults (men and women). At the enrollment&#xD;
      visit (Day-14), subjects will visit the OSU Clinical Research Center (CRC) for an oral&#xD;
      brushing; submit a 24-hour urine collection, and a saliva sample. Subjects will then start an&#xD;
      anthocyanin-free (avoid purple and red fruits and vegetables) diet which they will maintain&#xD;
      for 6 weeks of this study. After 2 weeks, subjects will have their first &quot;washout&quot; visit at&#xD;
      the CRC. This visit will be one of two &quot;washout visits&quot; where subjects will again submit&#xD;
      samples (fasting blood, urine, saliva, and oral brushing). At this visit, smokers will be&#xD;
      block randomized (random assignment using computer software) into one of two groups&#xD;
      (strawberry or placebo gummies) with a matching non-smoker having the same gender and age&#xD;
      group. A salivary pharmacokinetic (sPK) study will follow and involves collection of saliva&#xD;
      at these time points: 5 minutes before gummy placed in the mouth, and at 5,10,15,20,25, and&#xD;
      30 minutes after gummies have been in the mouth. Subjects will be instructed to consume 2&#xD;
      pieces of strawberry, or placebo gummy 4 times a day for 7 days. After 7 days subjects return&#xD;
      to the CRC for a &quot;treatment visit&quot; to submit fasting blood, urine, saliva and oral brushing&#xD;
      samples. Subjects will repeat the two-week anthocyanin-free diet and return to the CRC for&#xD;
      another &quot;washout visit&quot; before crossing over to the other study gummy. After 7 days of gummy&#xD;
      consumption, subjects will return for their second treatment visit and submit fasting blood,&#xD;
      oral brushing, saliva, and 24 hour urine collection.&#xD;
