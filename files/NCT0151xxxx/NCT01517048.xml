      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) and MC4R genetic mutations are two conditions that can cause&#xD;
      problems with appetite regulation. People with PWS often have behavior and thinking problems.&#xD;
      People with MC4R mutations may have problems with attention. These problems may be related to&#xD;
      Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF), a protein that is important for brain development.&#xD;
      Researchers want to study people with PWS and MC4R mutations to see how BDNF is involved in&#xD;
      these conditions. Specifically, body weight and brain function will be studied, and compared&#xD;
      with healthy volunteers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To study how BDNF affects body weight and brain function in people with PWS and MC4R&#xD;
      mutations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Individuals of any age who have Prader-Willi syndrome or MC4R genetic mutations.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Healthy volunteers of any age to act as control participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be screened with a medical history and physical exam. Height, weight,&#xD;
           and waist/hip circumferences will be measured. Blood samples will be taken for genetic&#xD;
           and other tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will fill out questionnaires about eating habits, pain perception, and&#xD;
           sleep behavior.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will keep a 3-day food diary to record all food and drinks eaten.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Tests and questionnaires will be given to study thinking, speech, movement, behavior,&#xD;
           and mood. Some tests will be done on a computer; other tests will be on paper. Tests may&#xD;
           also involve performing tasks with blocks and other objects.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants may have other tests as directed. These will include hot and cold&#xD;
           sensitivity tests, imaging studies like x-rays, and measurements of body fat and water&#xD;
           content.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Treatment will not be provided as part of this study.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is a protein that is important in nervous system&#xD;
      development and function. BDNF also appears to function downstream of the leptin-melanocortin&#xD;
      signaling pathway to control appetite. In both animals and humans, diminished BDNF function&#xD;
      is associated with hyperphagia, obesity, and neurocognitive deficits. We propose to study&#xD;
      BDNF in two hyperphagic disorders: Prader-Willi syndrome and MC4R function-altering&#xD;
      mutations. We hypothesize that patients with PWS may have increased BDNF during infancy,&#xD;
      followed by a decline in BDNF that precedes the onset of hyperphagia and persists after the&#xD;
      onset of obesity. We hypothesize that patients with MC4R mutations will have decreased BDNF,&#xD;
      the severity of which will be associated with the degree of MC4R functional loss caused by&#xD;
      the specific mutation(s) in each individual. To test these hypotheses, we wish to conduct&#xD;
      cross-sectional studies to evaluate serum BDNF concentrations, metabolism, body composition,&#xD;
      and neurocognition in: subjects with PWS, subjects with MC4R mutations and control subjects&#xD;
      matched for age, sex, race, and BMI. If alterations in BDNF are found to be associated with&#xD;
      PWS and/or MC4R mutations, these investigations could lead to future studies of BDNF receptor&#xD;
      agonists as mechanism-specific pharmacologic therapy for hyperphagia and obesity in PWS and&#xD;
      MC4R mutations, or BDNF receptor antagonists for failure-to-thrive in neonatal PWS.&#xD;

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Subject Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. For PWS subjects: We will enroll 75 subjects of all ages who have diagnosis of PWS&#xD;
             confirmed by chromosome analysis (i.e. interstitial deletion of paternally-derived&#xD;
             chromosome 15q, uniparental maternal disomy or other chromosome 15 abnormalities). Our&#xD;
             goal is to have 25 infants, 25 non-obese, and 25 obese subjects in order to assess the&#xD;
             different phases associated with PWS. Subjects receiving growth hormone therapy may&#xD;
             enroll if the dose has been stable for the preceding 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. For MC4R subjects: We will screen up to 200 subjects for mutations of MC4R and enroll&#xD;
             50 subjects of all ages who have diagnosis of homozygous or heterozygous MC4R mutation&#xD;
             confirmed by sequencing of the MC4R gene. Both functional-altering (N=25) and&#xD;
             non-pathologic (N=25) mutations will be included.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. For control subjects: We will enroll 125 subjects of all ages who match with PWS or&#xD;
             MC4R subjects by age (plus-minus 10%), sex, race, and BMI percentile (plus-minus10%).&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Subject Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. For all subjects:&#xD;

&#xD;
               2. Individuals who have, or whose parent or guardians have, current substance abuse&#xD;
                  or a psychiatric disorder or other condition which, in the opinion of the&#xD;
                  investigators, would impede competence or compliance or possibly hinder&#xD;
                  completion of the study&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. If age &gt;12 months, greater than 2% body weight loss in preceding 6 months&#xD;
&#xD;
               4. Anorexiant or weight loss medication use in preceding 6 months&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. For control subjects:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Chronic medical conditions anticipated to affect results or impede study&#xD;
                  participation&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Medication use will be reviewed on a case-by-case basis by the Principal&#xD;
                  Investigator to determine eligibility&#xD;
