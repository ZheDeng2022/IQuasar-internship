      The purpose of this study is to assess the early bacterial activity (EBA) from day 0 to day&#xD;
      14 of Astra Zeneca Drug (AZD5847) at four different doses and schedules (500 mg once daily,&#xD;
      500 mg twice daily, 1200 mg once daily, and 800 mg twice daily) in subjects with&#xD;
      newly-diagnosed sputum smear positive pulmonary TB. A total of 75 subjects will be enrolled,&#xD;
      with 15 randomized to each AZD5847 study arm or standard treatment with Rifafour. Duration of&#xD;
      drug treatment is 14 days.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a study of early bactericidal activity (EBA) in treatment-naïve patients with active&#xD;
      pulmonary tuberculosis. This prospective, randomized, open-label study that will compare the&#xD;
      effect of monotherapy with each of four dose levels of AZD5847 to that of an active control&#xD;
      (Rifafour administered orally once daily) on the concentration of Mycobacterium tuberculosis&#xD;
      (M. tb) in expectorated sputum (colony-forming units per mL of sputum). Daily quantitative&#xD;
      sputum cultures will be performed during treatment and analyzed by investigators who will be&#xD;
      blinded to the assigned treatment. The duration of therapy will be 14 days in order to&#xD;
      support an assessment of early bactericidal activity (days 0-2) and sterilizing activity&#xD;
      (days 3-14). Because of the risk of emergence of drug resistance in TB patients treated with&#xD;
      a single active drug, regulatory and ethical requirements restrict monotherapy to a maximum&#xD;
      duration of 14 days (EMEA Draft TB Guidance 2008). The study will utilize a standard design&#xD;
      and will thus support comparison with other marketed and investigational antimycobacterial&#xD;
      agents (Donald and Diacon 2008). The primary aim of the study is to assess the EBA 0-14 of&#xD;
      AZD5847 at four different doses and schedules (500 mg once daily, 500 mg twice daily, 1200 mg&#xD;
      once daily, and 800 mg twice daily) in subjects with newly-diagnosed sputum smear positive&#xD;
      pulmonary TB. The secondary aim is to assess the EBA 0-2 and EBA 2-14 of AZD5847 at the above&#xD;
      doses.&#xD;
