    <textblock>
      Heel spur is a troublesome disorder. Its formation is accompanied by pain in the area of heel&#xD;
      and it makes walking limited or even impossible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the study is to analyze analgesic efficacy of ultrasound and shock wave therapy in&#xD;
      patients with heel spur.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study included 52 patients of both sexes, aged 38-86 (average 57.39) with plantar heel&#xD;
      spur confirmed radiographically. The patients were randomly divided into two groups;in Group&#xD;
      1 the patients underwent ultrasound procedure (10 treatments)and in Group 2 - radial shock&#xD;
      wave procedure(6 treatments). The researchers assessed pain three times (prior to the&#xD;
      therapy, after the first and then the second week of treatment). In order to do this they&#xD;
      used a modified form of the Laitinen pain indicators questionnaire (results expressed in&#xD;
      points) and VAS - visual analogue scale (results given in milimeters). The results were&#xD;
      statistically analyzed. In the studied periods of time a decrease in pain was observed (both&#xD;
      in the Laitinen questionnaire and in the VAS scale). The most rapid change was noted in both&#xD;
      the groups after the first week of treatment. Ultrasound and shock wave therapies show a&#xD;
      comparably significant analgesic efficacy in patients with heel spur. Shock wave therapy has&#xD;
      an advantage over ultrasound therapy. A smaller number of procedures is required to obtain&#xD;
      comparable results, which makes the therapy less expensive. No side effects were observed&#xD;
      during and after the treatment.&#xD;

      The study was conducted on a group of 52 patients of both sexes, aged 38-86 years (mean&#xD;
      57.39; SD-11.5) with a plantar calcaneal spur confirmed by X-ray images. Patients were&#xD;
      treated in the Department of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation Day Unit of the University&#xD;
      Hospital im. WAM - Central Veterans Hospital in Lodz and Municipal Health Clinic of&#xD;
      Andrespol. In order to compare the effectiveness of the two forms of physiotherapy,&#xD;
      ultrasound and radial shock wave therapy, the patients were randomly assigned (using a simple&#xD;
      randomization) into two groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group 1 - ultrasound therapy group: 22 patients aged 38-86 years (mean 58.64; SD-12.99),&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group 2 - radial shock wave group: 30 patients aged 40-71 years (mean 56.13; SD-10.02).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ultrasound (US) was performed with a BTL 5840 S device, using labile technique, targeting the&#xD;
      calcaneal tumor and attachment of the plantar aponeurosis (pain points); the power setting&#xD;
      was 1,5 W/cm2, 80% fill factor, at a frequency of 1 MHz (head 4cm2). The duration of a single&#xD;
      treatment was four minutes, and the coupling substance used was paraffin oil. Treatment&#xD;
      sessions were performed daily Monday through Friday for a period of two weeks in a series of&#xD;
      10 treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The shock wave therapy (SWT) was performed on the affected area using a BTL-5000 SWT device&#xD;
      connected to a 15 mm diameter applicator according to the producer's recommendations; during&#xD;
      therapy, 2000 strokes were applied with a frequency of 10 Hz and a capacity of 2.5 bar.&#xD;
      Therapy took place for two weeks in a series of 6 treatments with a two-day interval between&#xD;
      treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, all patients underwent kinesitherapy - exercises to strengthen the muscles that&#xD;
      bending plantar and supinated foot to improve the mobility of the feet and to maintain the&#xD;
      normal longitudinal arch of the foot. SPR orthopedic inserts with a pit on the painful area&#xD;
      was used to support the longitudinal foot arch and relieve the medial ridge of the calcaneal&#xD;
      tumor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In all patients, pain intensity was assessed three times: before therapy, and after the first&#xD;
      and second week of treatment. A modified form of the Laitinen indicators of pain&#xD;
      question-shem was used [12]. On the basis of their subjective feelings, patients evaluated&#xD;
      pain intensity, frequency of occurrence, use of analgesics, and the impact of pain on their&#xD;
      physical activity. In addition, pain intensity was also assessed on the Huskisson visual -&#xD;
      analogue scale (VAS) [13]; patients marked a point on a 100 mm line which corresponded to the&#xD;
      current pain sensations - the results being given in millimeters.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The results were analyzed by Student's t-test for dependent and independent tests, with a&#xD;
      significance level of p &lt;0.05. The results are presented as arithmetic mean and standard&#xD;
      deviation.&#xD;
