  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This randomized controlled trial (RCT) will examine a nurse case management model for&#xD;
      patients suffering from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) in a Danish&#xD;
      municipality, and is performed in order to evaluate the use of case management as a tool in&#xD;
      achieving integrated, quality and cost-effective care for this group of patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objectives are to evaluate how case management influences on hospital admissions,&#xD;
      mortality, quality of life and self care, as well as to compare costs and cost-effectiveness&#xD;
      of case management vs. usual care.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Case management is being implemented as a health service strategy that should contribute to&#xD;
      maximize health outcomes within a cost-constrained environment. Evaluations of case&#xD;
      management in Danish settings are sparse, and so far no Danish studies have evaluated the&#xD;
      cost-effectiveness of case management.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is performed as a RCT, and the study focuses exclusively on patients with COPD.&#xD;
      The patients will be enrolled and randomized after being referred to rehabilitation at the&#xD;
      local rehabilitation center in Aalborg municipality, Denmark. 150 patients will be randomly&#xD;
      assigned to two groups of 75 patients each. Participants in the control group will receive&#xD;
      usual care, whereas patients assigned to the interventional group will receive case&#xD;
      management besides their usual care. Each patient will be followed for 12 months. Patients in&#xD;
      both groups will fill out questionnaires at baseline and 12 months. The data register system&#xD;
      &quot;Health - Planning and Quality&quot; in the Northern Region of Jutland will be used to determine&#xD;
      health care services and costs.&#xD;

    <description>The investigators will obtain 2 measurements from each patient and are therefore able to evaluate the change in Qol from baseline to end of study (1 year in total). Both generic (EQ-5D, SF-12) and disease-specific questionnaires (Sct. George Respiratory questionnaire, SG-RQ) will be used.</description>

    <description>The cost-effectiveness analysis will examine and compare the cost of health care resources and health outcomes between the two groups. The costs will include all health care utilization during the 1 year of follow-up.&#xD;
Quality adjusted life years (QALYs) is the preferred measure for cost-effectivenes analysis. QALYs will be calculated based on the EuroQol (EQ-5D).</description>

    <description>The patients who are randomized to the intervention group will be assigned to case management.

    <description>Patients, who are randomized to the intervention group, will receive case management from a trained and experienced nurse. The case manager will carry out following tasks:&#xD;
Formulation and implementation of care plans together with the patient&#xD;
Monitoring of individual status and care plan effectuation&#xD;
Overall coordination between health care providers&#xD;
Support to the patient and their caregivers during times of transition related to health status and environmental changes (e.g. hospital to home)&#xD;
Regular telephone consultations and home visits&#xD;
Promote disease-self management through coaching</description>
