  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) of the National Institute of Health&#xD;
      (NIH) has sponsored a consortium of four sites across the United States, entitled Childhood&#xD;
      Obesity Prevention and Treatment Research (COPTR). Each site has its own protocol. Case&#xD;
      Western Reserve/Cleveland's project is entitled &quot;Targeting Obesity and Blood Pressure in&#xD;
      Urban Youth&quot;. The site name is IMPACT (Ideas Moving Parents and Adolescents to Change&#xD;
      Together).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The project assesses the effects of three interventions on Body Mass Index(BMI) in overweight&#xD;
      and obese urban 5th-8th grade youth: a cognitive-behavioral intervention (HealthyChange), a&#xD;
      systems improvement intervention (SystemsChange), and an education-only intervention&#xD;
      (Tools4Change). In addition the study assesses the potential additional impact of a&#xD;
      school-community based intervention on outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The project has two phases: a formative phase (including focus groups and a pilot) and the&#xD;
      main trial. The main trial will take place over approximately four years.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The IMPACT trial will involve a 3-arm randomized controlled trial of three behavioral and&#xD;
      educational interventions: (1) HealthyCHANGE, a behavioral approach focusing on building&#xD;
      skills and increasing intrinsic motivation (based on cognitive-behavioral theory with&#xD;
      motivational interviewing components); (2) SystemCHANGE, an innovative behavioral approach&#xD;
      focusing on system re-design of the family environment and daily routines (based on&#xD;
      social-ecological and personal process improvement theories); and (3) education-only&#xD;
      (representing usual care, called Tools4CHANGE).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the main trial, approximately half of the children will also be in schools that take part&#xD;
      in the We Run This City (WRTC)Marathon program, a school-based fitness program administered&#xD;
      by the YMCA, and half will be in schools that do not take part in the WRTC program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will assess the impact of the interventions on the main trial's (1) primary&#xD;
      outcome, Change in Body Mass Index (BMI). (2) secondary outcomes including diet, physical&#xD;
      activity, sedentary behavior, sleep, blood pressure, cardiovascular risk, body composition,&#xD;
      fitness, and quality of life (3) mediators including : child's self-efficacy, social support,&#xD;
      motivation, family problem solving ability, systems thinking, and self-regulation;(4)&#xD;
      moderators including: socioeconomic status, demographic factors, environmental factors,&#xD;
      personal and psychosocial characteristics of child and parent.&#xD;

        <title>Quality of Life- Perceived Stress</title>
        <description>The annualized change in perceived stress over 3 years. Participants are asked to rate individual scale items on their perception of how often they feel specific stressors on a scale from 0 (never) to 4 (very often). Individual scale items are summed for a total score. Higher scores indicate higher perceived frequency of stressors, therefore higher perceived stress. Outcomes are reported as the mean of the slope estimates for total perceived stress score over 3 years (from baseline to 36 months).&#xD;
The perceived stress slope (trajectory over 3 years) was created for each participant with outcomes multiply imputed for children without stress scores post-baseline. An F test with two numerator degrees of freedom was used to test for between-group differences using an alpha of .05.</description>

An F test with two numerator degrees of freedom was used to test for between-group differences using an alpha of .05.&#xD;
Change in slope of waist-to-height ratio over time reported. The weight-to-heigh ratio compares the child's waist circumference (cm) to their height (cm).</description>
