    <textblock>
      The MAPT PLUS study is a two-year extension of follow-up of the patients included in the MAPT&#xD;
      preventive study, after completion of the interventions. Subjects in the four groups of the&#xD;
      MAPT study will be prospectively followed. MAPT is a multicentre, randomised,&#xD;
      placebo-controlled study, using a 4-group design with 3 treatment groups (omega 3 alone,&#xD;
      multi-domain intervention alone, omega 3 plus multi-domain intervention, n=420 each) and a&#xD;
      placebo group (n=420). The MAPT PLUS study will be an extension of the MAPT study and&#xD;
      includes an annual follow-up for two years.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>

      The MAPT PLUS study is a follow-up of subjects initially included in an interventional study.&#xD;
      The follow-up that we propose in this request for funding does not involve any intervention,&#xD;
      but aims to assess the long-term effect of the interventions previously carried out during&#xD;
      the three years of the MAPT study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      * Description of the interventions to which subjects are exposed during the first 3 years of&#xD;
      follow-up (MAPT study) :&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the MAPT study, subjects are randomized into 4 groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  V0137 CA group: 2 soft capsules of V0137 CA once a day (2 x 400 mg/day);&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Multi-domain intervention group (nutrition, physical activity, cognitive stimulation,&#xD;
           social activities) + placebo, 2 soft capsules once a day ;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Multi-domain intervention group (nutrition, physical activity, cognitive stimulation,&#xD;
           social activities) + V0137 CA, 2 soft capsules once a day ;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Placebo group: 2 soft capsules of placebo once a day. * Description of the multidomain&#xD;
           intervention : The multi-domain intervention consists of collective training sessions&#xD;
           and a yearly personalized preventive consultation which aims to detect risk factors&#xD;
           (sensory disturbances, difficulty in walking, nutritional disturbances, vascular risk&#xD;
           factors) and to set up management in collaboration with the general practitioner.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The collective sessions take place in groups of 6 to 8 subjects. In the first month, two&#xD;
      sessions a week are scheduled, and in the second month, one session a week. The first two&#xD;
      months correspond to the intensive programme. Each session comprises 1 hour of cognitive&#xD;
      training, 45 minutes of information on physical activity and 15 minutes of dietary advice.&#xD;
      From the third month, sessions are held monthly and aim to consolidate the key messages and&#xD;
      to stimulate adherence to the programme. The sessions are shorter (1 hour review of one of&#xD;
      the domains of the intensive programme). &quot; Booster &quot; sessions (2 hours) are delivered at 12&#xD;
      and 24 months after the first sessions of the intensive programme. Twenty-minute individual&#xD;
      interviews also take place every 6 months with the leader of the training sessions (6&#xD;
      interviews in the course of 3 years).&#xD;
