      The purpose of this study is to determine the effect of NanoDOX™ Hydrogel in conjunction with&#xD;
      serial wound debridement and irrigation on the healing rates of open traumatic orthopedic and&#xD;
      soft tissue wounds when compared to a serial wound debridement and irrigation alone in&#xD;
      patients receiving negative pressure wound therapy/vacuum assisted closure (NPWT/VAC) with&#xD;
      reticulated open cell foam (ROCF) dressings.&#xD;
