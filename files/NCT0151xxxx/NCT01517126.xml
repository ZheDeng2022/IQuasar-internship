      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Currently, there is no standard method to study suicide risk in youth with developmental&#xD;
      delays or intellectual disabilities (DD/ID). Youth with DD/ID are often excluded from studies&#xD;
      that are used to develop these methods. As a result, most current suicide risk assessments&#xD;
      have not been tested for use with people with DD/ID. Researchers want to develop an effective&#xD;
      suicide risk screening tool for children and adolescents with DD/ID.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To develop a suicide risk screening tool for young adults with DD/ID.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Young adults between 12 and 21 years of age who have DD/ID and are in mental health&#xD;
           counseling.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be in counseling at Surrey Place Centre, a community health center in&#xD;
           Toronto, Canada.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will fill out questionnaires during a 1-hour meeting with a therapist. The&#xD;
           questions will ask about mood and current feelings, including whether the participant&#xD;
           has been thinking about or planning to hurt or kill him or herself now or in the past.&#xD;
           Other questions will ask about participants' understanding of death in general.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Parents of participants may also fill out a questionnaire. It will ask about how the&#xD;
           participant has been feeling. It will also ask whether the parent has noticed any signs&#xD;
           that suggest suicidal thoughts or actions, now and in the past.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Treatment will not be provided as part of this protocol. However, participants can&#xD;
           receive counseling through the regular Surrey Place Centre services.&#xD;

      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently, no gold standard is available for evaluating suicidal thoughts and behaviors in&#xD;
      individuals with developmental delay or intellectual disabilities (DD/ID). Moreover, youth&#xD;
      with DD are often excluded from instrument validation studies. Therefore, there is a paucity&#xD;
      of sufficiently adapted and validated clinical suicide risk assessments for use with clients&#xD;
      with DD/ID. The main objective of this study is to develop and assess the efficacy of a&#xD;
      suicide screening tool for child and adolescent clients with DD/ID. More specifically:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1: To modify the Risk of Suicide Questionnaire (RSQ) in order to create a suicide&#xD;
      screening tool for a pediatric mental health population with DD/ID.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2: To determine the feasibility of a suicide screening tool, (developed in Aim 1) to&#xD;
      detect suicide risk in pediatric clients with DD/ID presenting to a community health center&#xD;
      for mental health reasons.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The NIMH is collaborating with Surrey Place Centre, a community health center in Toronto,&#xD;
      Canada. The study population will be Surrey Place Centre clients, ages 12 and older,&#xD;
      diagnosed with DD/ID, currently accessing individual mental health counseling. There will be&#xD;
      no exclusion based on gender or race.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This will be a prospective instrument development study. Potential participants will be&#xD;
      identified by research assistants (RAs) and therapists. Following informed consent and assent&#xD;
      procedures, therapists will administer the Risk of Suicide Questionnaire Intellectual&#xD;
      Disability Patient (RSQ-ID-Patient), and the Suicidal Ideation Questionnaire Child Version&#xD;
      (SIQ-CV) to clients, and the RA will have the parents/guardians complete the Risk of Suicide&#xD;
      Questionnaire-Intellectual Disability-Parent (RSQ-ID Parent). Three months after client&#xD;
      participation, therapists will fill out a Therapist Follow-up Questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome measures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary outcome measures include the RSQ-ID Patient, and the SIQ-CV, along with the RSQ-ID&#xD;
      Parent. Secondary outcome measure is the Research Assistant Evaluation Form and the Clinician&#xD;
      Follow- up Form.&#xD;
