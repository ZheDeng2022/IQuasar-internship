      In this study the investigators will examine the Feeding Dynamic Intervention (FDI) as a tool&#xD;
      to prevent obesity in young children. The purpose of the intervention is to improving&#xD;
      caregiver feeding practices, child eating behaviors, and child self-regulation of energy&#xD;
      intake in the short term.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Childhood obesity is a significant public health problem. In the last three decade, there has&#xD;
      been a marked increase in the prevalence of childhood obesity. Currently, 23% of preschoolers&#xD;
      (2-5 years) in the United States are overweight or obese, a critical period to target in&#xD;
      hopes of reversing this trend. The purpose of this study is to test the efficacy of a novel&#xD;
      obesity intervention program for preschool-aged children. Emerging consensus indicates that&#xD;
      excessive, intrusive, overt control in feeding or a chaotic non-structured feeding&#xD;
      environment are risk factors for childhood obesity. The 2007 Expert Committee Recommendations&#xD;
      on the Prevention, Assessment, and Treatment of Childhood Obesity specifically identified&#xD;
      maternal feeding practices as important, categorically stating there is consistent evidence&#xD;
      to support &quot;avoiding overly restrictive feeding behaviors.&quot; The guidelines emerged from a&#xD;
      growing body of literature indicating that overly controlling caregiver feeding behaviors, in&#xD;
      particular, significantly increase children's obesity risk.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite the evidence for the importance of feeding dynamics, no childhood obesity&#xD;
      interventions focused on this area have been rigorously tested. The Feeding Dynamic&#xD;
      Intervention (FDI) is a 12-week educational intervention. The intervention will be delivered&#xD;
      in a closed group setting and will consist of 6 intervention sessions lasting 90 minutes&#xD;
      each. We will recruit 84 mothers with 3- to 5-year-old obese children, randomly assigned to&#xD;
      either the FDI or a comparison to a waiting list control group (WLG). At the end of the 6&#xD;
      month study we will assess knowledge and behavioral changes between the groups on (i)&#xD;
      maternal self-reported feeding practices; (ii) improving energy compensation (COMPX),&#xD;
      decreasing Eating in the Absence of Hunger (EAH) and increasing mother-reported satiety&#xD;
      responsiveness in their child. Finally, we will investigate an exploratory hypothesis that&#xD;
      children in the FDI group, compared to children in the wait-list control group, will&#xD;
      demonstrate a lower increase in body mass index (BMI) z-score over 6 months.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The child is between ages 3-5 years (36 to 71 months). [Note if a family has more than&#xD;
             one qualifying child we will choose the child with the lower CEBQ SR score and if they&#xD;
             are equal we will randomly select the target child for the study dyad.]&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Child's body mass index &gt; 85th percentile for age and sex&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  This will be calculated based on age, weight and height using the Center for Healthy&#xD;
             Weight and Nutrition BMI calculator [if mother is unsure of the weight and height ask&#xD;
             whether she has been told her child is overweight or obese by the PCP]&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Child has significantly abnormal parent-reported impairment of energy regulation&#xD;
             (Rating of 2.8 or lower on the CEB-Q).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The mother is fluent in English (measures are limited to English at this time)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Mother (or female caregiver) has primary legal and physical custody of the child and&#xD;
             is primarily responsible for feeding the child. Specifically the child is not in a&#xD;
             non-parental home daycare more than 20 hours/week. Structured child care centers are&#xD;
             not included in this limitation because they use structure care and feeding techniques&#xD;
             similar to those taught in the FeeDIn Program.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Child has a medical condition or takes a medication that affects appetite, eating, or&#xD;
             growth;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Child has food allergies or dietary restrictions that interfere with feeding or the&#xD;
             study tests (i.e., milk, gluten and eggs?)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Child has any developmental or behavioral diagnosis that might affect his/her ability&#xD;
             to respond to a behaviorally-based intervention, e.g., cognitive impairment, language&#xD;
             delay, or autism.&#xD;
