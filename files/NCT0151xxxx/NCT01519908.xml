      power of these (bio)markers on improvement and/or deterioration of cardiac function, cardiac&#xD;
      geometry (reverse re-modeling during CRT) will be evaluated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      (Bio)markers include but are not limited to: collagen, genomic markers, molecular markers,&#xD;

      1-month, 6-month and 12 month follow-up. The total study duration will be 3 years. The 5&#xD;
      participating clinical institutions are all located in the Netherlands and member of the&#xD;
      COHFAR project which is a partnership of the Center for Translational Molecular Medicine&#xD;
      (CTMM) and Universitair Medisch Centrum Utrecht (UMCU), Universitair Medisch Centrum&#xD;
      Groningen (UMCG), Academisch Medisch Centrum (AMC), VU Medisch Centrum (VUMC), Maastricht&#xD;

      Foundation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each study subject will receive cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT-D) according to the&#xD;
      ESC/AHA guidelines and per local hospital routine. Additionally, optimal medical therapy for&#xD;
      heart failure is up to the investigator's discretion.&#xD;
