    <textblock>
      Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) is one of the most prevalent mental illnesses in North&#xD;
      America, in which 30% - 40% fail to respond to conventional treatment. Repetitive&#xD;
      Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (rTMS) has been shown to be an effective therapeutic tool&#xD;
      for the treatment of MDD. This form of treatment involves a series of magnetic pulses&#xD;
      directed to the brain for about 30 minutes. Importantly, such treatment is very safe and well&#xD;
      tolerated. However, to date, most treatment studies show modest efficacy due to limitations,&#xD;
      including: 1) treatments that are delivered to only one side of the brain; 2) treatment that&#xD;
      does not directly target a specific brain region associated with depression; 3) treatments&#xD;
      that are of short duration; 4) treatments that are of insufficient intensity; and 5)&#xD;
      insufficient understanding of the brain mechanisms responsible for therapeutic effect. This&#xD;
      study is designed to directly address all of these limitations, as well as explore brain&#xD;
      mechanisms (e.g. cortical excitability) through which treatment is optimized.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Several studies have demonstrated that rTMS is an efficacious treatment for treatment&#xD;
      resistant major depressive disorder (TRD). However, recent meta-analyses, and more recent,&#xD;
      large, multi-centre studies, have provided evidence suggesting that rTMS, at best, provides&#xD;
      modest therapeutic efficacy compared to sham stimulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several reasons may account for this modest therapeutic effect. First, the majority of these&#xD;
      studies involved left-sided treatment alone to the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC),&#xD;
      which is a significant limitation when considering that electroconvulsive therapy - another&#xD;
      form of brain stimulation used in TRD - has been shown to be less efficacious when used&#xD;
      unilaterally, compared to bilaterally.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Second, sub-optimal methods were utilized to target the DLPFC (i.e., '5-cm anterior method'),&#xD;
      limiting the treatment potential of what is inherently a targeted form of treatment. In this&#xD;
      regard, recent data from the investigators suggests that treatment directly targeting the&#xD;
      DLPFC provides enhanced therapeutic efficacy compared to the '5-cm anterior' method.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Third, treatment durations were typically short (i.e., 2-4 weeks). Fourth, stimulation&#xD;
      intensity may have been insufficient by not taking into consideration coil-to-cortex&#xD;
      distance, which is of particular importance when considering that this parameter may&#xD;
      contribute significantly to rTMS-induced antidepressant response. Fifth, there has not been a&#xD;
      study that has examined TRD across the lifespan in a way that addresses the differences&#xD;
      between older and younger adults. Therefore, the investigators propose to conduct a study&#xD;
      evaluating the efficacy of rTMS for TRD that directly addresses all 5 of these major&#xD;
      limitations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will compare bilateral rTMS to unilateral rTMS and will involve targeting the&#xD;
      DLPFC using cortical co-registration techniques, as well as treatments of optimal duration&#xD;
      (i.e., up to 6 weeks) and intensity parameters (i.e., adjusted for coil-to-cortex distance).&#xD;
      The use of distance cortical co-registration and adjustment for coil-to-cortex distance&#xD;
      addresses the major limitation (lack of stimulation intensity to compensate for age-related&#xD;
      prefrontal atrophy) in studies that have examined rTMS in an elderly sample. Preliminary data&#xD;
      from this research group provide compelling evidence that rTMS may, indeed, be effective when&#xD;
      some of these limitations are optimized in both younger and older adults. Finally, it is also&#xD;
      essential that research investigate the mechanisms of therapeutic efficacy, so that increases&#xD;
      in understanding can be translated into enhanced treatment. For several reasons, cortical&#xD;
      excitability may represent a neurophysiological process through which the therapeutic effects&#xD;
      of rTMS are mediated. Recent advances in electroencephalography (EEG) technology now permit&#xD;
      direct measurement of excitability from the DLPFC; thus, we are now able to ascertain whether&#xD;
      these are mechanisms through which the therapeutic effects of rTMS in TRD are mediated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypotheses:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 1: Treatment with bilateral and high frequency left rTMS (HFL-rTMS) will both&#xD;
      result in a greater reduction in 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D17) scores&#xD;
      compared to sham rTMS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 2: Bilateral rTMS will result in a significantly greater number of patients&#xD;
      reaching criteria for therapeutic response and remission on the HAM-D17 compared to&#xD;
      unilateral or sham rTMS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 3: An increase of excitability following HFL-rTMS to the left DLPFC (in the case&#xD;
      of bilateral rTMS or HFL-rTMS) and a decrease in excitability following low frequency&#xD;
      right-rTMS (LFR-rTMS; in the case of bilateral rTMS) to the right DLPFC will mediate the&#xD;
      relationship between rTMS and response in TRD. Finally, the induction of gamma activity&#xD;
      following rTMS will be associated with improved treatment efficacy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 4: rTMS will result in improved executive function in patients over age 60 with&#xD;
      TRD.&#xD;
