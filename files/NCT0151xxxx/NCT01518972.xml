  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether the drug prazosin is effective for the&#xD;
      treatment of alcohol dependency and symptoms of Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Background: Alcohol dependence (AD) is a biologically, genetically based disease, yet the&#xD;
      majority of clinically accepted treatments are behaviorally or psychosocially based. PTSD and&#xD;
      alcohol use disorders (AUDs) commonly co-occur. This comorbidity is associated with more&#xD;
      severe clinical impairment, shorter times to relapse, more treatment recidivism, overall&#xD;
      greater use of treatment services, and greater treatment costs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Neuropharmacology of alcohol and prazosin: Emerging pre-clinical evidence shows that&#xD;
      noradrenergic systems are involved in brain processes relevant to AD, such as arousal,&#xD;
      reinforcement, and stress responsivity. However, virtually no work to date has attempted to&#xD;
      translate this knowledge into clinically effective biological interventions. The&#xD;
      investigators have adopted the novel, promising strategy of reducing adrenergic activity by&#xD;
      blocking noradrenaline binding to post-synaptic alpha-1 receptors via the non-selective,&#xD;
      alpha-1 antagonist, prazosin. Preclinical studies have demonstrated that prazosin decreases&#xD;
      reinstatement of alcohol consumption, and preliminary clinical data suggest that prazosin&#xD;
      reduces alcohol use in humans with AD and reduces PTSD-related nightmares and other symptoms,&#xD;
      though it has not been tested in individuals with comorbid AD and PTSD. Prazosin, FDA&#xD;
      approved to treat hypertension, typically has few side effects, and is inexpensive.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: Randomized double-blind placebo-controlled clinical trial. Participants: 60&#xD;
      individuals with both AD and PTSD (25% women) with stated goal to abstain from alcohol use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention: Either prazosin titrated per study protocol or matched placebo for 6 weeks with&#xD;
      Medical Management (MM) based on the COMBINE Study procedures and a final study visit two&#xD;
      weeks after medication discontinuation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measures: The primary outcomes are alcohol use during the 12-week medication phase of the&#xD;
      study and reports of craving during the same time period. Daily, prompted Interactive Voice&#xD;
      Response (IVR) telephone monitoring will be done throughout the 8-week study to assess the&#xD;
      primary outcomes and to provide information on affect and medication adherence. Such daily&#xD;
      monitoring provides more accurate reports of alcohol use than standard retrospective outcome&#xD;
      measures. Analyses: Hierarchical linear modeling to test for main effects of prazosin+MM&#xD;
      versus placebo+MM on alcohol use and PTSD symptoms over time, and to evaluate whether&#xD;
      reductions in PTSD mediate the effect of prazosin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Findings to date: Participants randomized to prazosin had a greater reduction in percent days&#xD;
      drinking per week and percent days heavy drinking per week between baseline and week 6 than&#xD;
      did placebo participants. No significant differences were detected within or between groups&#xD;
      in change from weeks 1 to 6 in total PTSD symptoms. Participants in the prazosin condition&#xD;
      reported drowsiness on significantly more days than those in the placebo condition. Public&#xD;
      health implications: There is a paucity of safe, tolerable, inexpensive, and efficacious&#xD;
      drugs currently available for the treatment of AD and PTSD. Consistent with the extant&#xD;
      research evaluating medications for comorbid PTSD/AD, the current evaluation of prazosin also&#xD;
      found decreased alcohol consumption but no medication effect on PTSD symptomatology.&#xD;

    <measure>Percent Drinking Days Per Week</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Data for this measure came from the Form-42 and daily IVR (Interactive Voice Response) monitoring. The percentage of drinking days of each participant was calculated by summing the number of drinking days and comparing them with the number of total drinking days in the same week. The percentage of drinking days from each week was added and averaged to get the percentage of drinking days per week per participant. The percentage of drinking days of all participants in the Prazosin group was added and averaged to get the mean of the percentage of weekly drinking days of the Prazosin group. These steps were repeated for the Placebo group.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Percent Heavy Drinking Days Per Week</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Data for this measure came from the Form-42 and daily IVR (Interactive Voice Response) monitoring. Heavy drinking was defined as 5 or more drinks per day for men and 4 or more drinks per day for women. The percentage of heavy drinking days of each participant was calculated by summing the number of heavy drinking days and comparing them with the total number of drinking days in the same week. The percentage of heavy drinking days from each week was added and averaged to get the percentage of heavy drinking days per week per participant. The percentage of heavy drinking days of all participants in the Prazosin group was added and averaged to get the mean of percentage of weekly heavy drinking days of the Prazosin group. These steps were repeated for the Placebo group.</description>

    <measure>Total Drinks Per Week</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Data for this measure came from the Form-42 and daily IVR (Interactive Voice Response) monitoring. The weekly total drinks of each participant were calculated by adding the number of drinks by week. The total drinks from each week were added and averaged to get the weekly total drinks of each participant. The weekly total drinks of all participants in the Prazosin group were added and averaged to get the total drinks per week for the Prazosin group. These steps were repeated for the Placebo group.</description>

    <measure>PTSD Symptom Assessments</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>PTSD symptoms/changes in PTSD (Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder) symptomatology was calculated using data from the IVR (interactive Voice Response) monitoring. PTSD scores were derived by computing the daily average of the item totals for overall PTSD and the symptom clusters. The rating range was 0 (not at all) to 8 (extremely). The higher the score/rating, the more severe the PTSD symptoms. The lowest and highest possible average are 0 and 8, respectively.</description>

          <title>Baseline Alcohol Craving Score</title>
          <description>This measurement was calculated using the Penn Alcohol Craving Scale (PACS). This questionnaire had 5 questions asking about the frequency, intensity, length, and irresistibility of the participants' craving and their overall average alcohol craving in the week prior to their baseline visit. The rating went from 0 to 6, thus the minimum and maximum possible scores were 0 and 30, respectively. The higher the score, the higher the participants' alcohol craving. Each participant's total score was calculated and then averaged to get the mean craving score of the Placebo &amp; Prazosin groups.</description>

It had 17 questions asking about how often participants re-experienced, avoided, and aroused by their trauma. The rating went from 0 (not at all) to 3 (5 or more times per week/very much), thus the minimum and maximum possible scores were 0 and 51, respectively. The higher the score, the higher the participants' PTSD score. Each participant's total score was calculated and then averaged to get the mean PTSD score of the Placebo &amp; Prazosin groups.</description>

The percentage of drinking days of each participant was calculated by summing the number of drinking days and comparing them with the number of total drinking days in the same week. The percentage of drinking days from each week was added and averaged to get the percentage of drinking days per week per participant. The percentage of drinking days of all participants in the Prazosin group was added and averaged to get the mean of the percentage of weekly drinking days of the Prazosin group. These steps were repeated for the Placebo group.</description>

        <description>Data for this measure came from the Form-42 and daily IVR (Interactive Voice Response) monitoring. Heavy drinking was defined as 5 or more drinks per day for men and 4 or more drinks per day for women. The percentage of heavy drinking days of each participant was calculated by summing the number of heavy drinking days and comparing them with the total number of drinking days in the same week. The percentage of heavy drinking days from each week was added and averaged to get the percentage of heavy drinking days per week per participant. The percentage of heavy drinking days of all participants in the Prazosin group was added and averaged to get the mean of percentage of weekly heavy drinking days of the Prazosin group. These steps were repeated for the Placebo group.</description>
        <time_frame>6 weeks</time_frame>
        <population>Percent heavy drinking days per week was examined using multilevel mixed-effects linear regression models with random slope that included treatment group, time, &amp; treatment group x time interaction. Time was modeled as a categorical variable.</population>

        <description>PTSD symptoms/changes in PTSD (Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder) symptomatology was calculated using data from the IVR (interactive Voice Response) monitoring. PTSD scores were derived by computing the daily average of the item totals for overall PTSD and the symptom clusters. The rating range was 0 (not at all) to 8 (extremely). The higher the score/rating, the more severe the PTSD symptoms. The lowest and highest possible average are 0 and 8, respectively.</description>
        <time_frame>6 weeks</time_frame>
        <population>PTSD outcomes between weeks 1 and 6 were analyzed using multilevel mixed-effects linear regression models. Models were adjusted for baseline PTSD severity as measured by corresponding PSS-I scores &amp; sub-scores because measures comparable to the IVR PTSD measures were not available at baseline. Analyses were also adjusted for gender.</population>
