    <textblock>
      This is a phase 1, single-center, placebo-controlled, single-blind, first-in-human,&#xD;
      single-ascending dose study with additional multiple-ascending dose cohorts in healthy male&#xD;
      and female volunteers.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A maximum of 56 healthy adult (male and female) subjects will participate in this study, in&#xD;
      two stages. In Stage 1, the Single-Ascending Dose (SAD) phase of the study will have up to&#xD;
      six cohorts with 4 subjects (3 receiving TKM-100201 and 1 receiving saline placebo) in each&#xD;
      cohort. Additional cohorts may be enrolled if a maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is not&#xD;
      established after the initial six cohorts. In Stage 2, the Multiple-Ascending Dose (MAD)&#xD;
      portion of the study will have up to three cohorts with four subjects (3 receiving TKM-100201&#xD;
      and 1 receiving saline placebo) in each cohort. Additional cohorts may be enrolled if a&#xD;
      maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is not established after the initial three cohorts.&#xD;

    <description>Subjects will be monitored for treatment-emergent and dose-limiting toxicity (DLT). If there are any adverse events (changes from baseline in laboratory parameters, vitals and/or infusion reactions) during these monitoring periods, the Independent Safety Committee, will discuss the dosing of the remaining subjects.&#xD;
Before proceeding to the next dose cohort, the Independent Safety Committee will evaluate whether dose escalation will be permitted based on demonstration of adequate safety and tolerability.</description>

             assessments, 12-lead ECG, clinical laboratory assessments, and by general&#xD;
             observations. Any abnormalities or deviations outside the normal ranges for any of&#xD;
             clinical testing (laboratory tests, ECG, vital signs) can be repeated at the&#xD;
             discretion of the Investigator(s) and judged to be not clinically significant for&#xD;
             study participation.&#xD;

                  volunteers that are surgically postmenopausal must provide documentation of the&#xD;
                  bilateral oophorectomy or hysterectomy prior to Day 1 dosing to be eligible for&#xD;
                  participation in the study; or&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Women of childbearing potential (FSH â‰¤40 mIU/mL) must have negative serum hCG at&#xD;
