      Introduction: Nosocomial and/or healthcare-associated Staphylococcus aureus infections are&#xD;
      common, serious conditions. S. aureus accounts for about 20% of cases of nosocomial&#xD;
      bacteremia, and is associated with a mortality of 20-40%. This severity is due to the&#xD;
      virulence of the bacterium, and the age and comorbidity of the patients in whom the infection&#xD;
      occurs. First-line therapy is based on vancomycin, because the prevalence of methicillin&#xD;
      resistance in S. aureus (~20%) is still high in the hospital environment. However the&#xD;
      bactericidal activity of this drug is slow and it causes dose-dependent nephrotoxicity. The&#xD;
      persistence of positive blood cultures after 72 hours, a parameter which in itself is&#xD;
      predictive of the infection having a complicated clinical course, is seen in about 35% of&#xD;
      patients receiving vancomycin therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: The use of daptomycin to treat nosocomial or healthcare-associated bacteremia due&#xD;
      to methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) would increase the proportion of patients whose&#xD;
      blood cultures are sterilized after 72 hours by 15% relative to vancomycin and would improve&#xD;
      treatment safety.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objective: To study the efficacy of daptomycin compared to vancomycin on the&#xD;
      sterilization of blood cultures after 72 hours of therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives: Clinical cure at D14 and D28; relapse-free clinical and bacteriological&#xD;
      cure at D90; mortality at D14, D28 and D90; treatment duration (in days) before sterilization&#xD;
      of blood cultures; side effects occurrence during treatment, renal insufficiency; peripheral&#xD;
      vein toxicity requiring placement of a central venous catheter; side effects requiring&#xD;
      changes to the study treatment ; duration of hospitalization for bacteremia; increase of at&#xD;
      least 2 dilutions in the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) of daptomycin and/or&#xD;
      vancomycin between the first and last clinical isolates of S. aureus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology: A prospective, multicenter, randomized, open-label study to compare daptomycin&#xD;
      monotherapy to vancomycin monotherapy. Patients will be randomized if they have a nosocomial&#xD;
      or healthcare-associated infection, a blood culture positive for Gram-positive cocci in&#xD;
      clusters, and a rapid molecular diagnostic test(GENEXPERT) that confirm the presence of&#xD;
      methicillin-resistant S. aureus. Daptomycin will be given once daily in monotherapy (10 mg/kg&#xD;
      as a single infusion over 30 minutes into a peripheral vein). Standard therapy is vancomycin&#xD;
      in monotherapy given by intermittent or continuous infusion so as to obtain trough&#xD;
      concentrations of 15-20 mg/L or plateau concentrations of 20-25 mg/L, respectively. The&#xD;
      treatment duration for bacteremia in both arms is 14 days of intravenous therapy for&#xD;
      uncomplicated bacteremias and 28 days of intravenous therapy for complicated bacteremias,&#xD;
      defined by persistent fever or positive blood cultures after 72 h of the study treatment,&#xD;
      secondary septic localizations existing at enrollment, or presence of foreign material&#xD;
      without signs of infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The duration of the treatment of the study can be reduced if the patients answer the&#xD;
      following criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Uncomplicated bacteremia: 10 days of treatment instead of 14 days if:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  2 sterilization of blood cultures&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patient clinically cured&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Visit J14 realized in the center&#xD;
&#xD;
      Complicated bacteremia: 21 days of treatment instead of 28 days if:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  2 sterilization of blood cultures&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patient clinically cured&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Visit J28 realized in the center&#xD;
&#xD;
      In every case, no oral relay has to substitute itself for the possible reduction of the&#xD;
      duration of the treatment of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A blinded study design was not selected because the two treatments are administered very&#xD;
      differently, due to the invasive nature of continuous infusion pumps, and because the primary&#xD;
      objective concerns a microbiological outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient management and clinical monitoring will comply with usual good clinical practice for&#xD;
      these patients. Visits on D14, D28 and D90 will be necessary. Laboratory monitoring will&#xD;
      comprise daily blood cultures until sterile cultures are obtained on 2 consecutive days; full&#xD;
      blood count (FBC), serum creatine, CPK before treatment, on D3, D7, D10 and D14 and, for&#xD;
      patients receiving 28 days of treatment, D21 and D28. Where myalgia with elevation of&#xD;
      creatine phosphokinase (CPK) &gt; 5 N, or isolated elevation of CPK &gt; 10 N occurs, treatment&#xD;
      with daptomycin will be discontinued and clinical and laboratory-based monitoring will be&#xD;
      maintained until normalization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Number of subjects required: After 72 hours of vancomycin therapy, blood cultures are still&#xD;
      positive in about 35% of patients. The objective is to show the superiority of daptomycin in&#xD;
      the sterilization of blood cultures after 72 hours, by a margin of 15% (80% versus 65%). With&#xD;
      a power of 80% and a type I error rate of 5%, and addition of 10% to allow for unevaluable&#xD;
      outcomes and death before 72 hours, the number of subjects required in each arm is 166 (total&#xD;
      = 332 patients).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study logistics: Duration of the study: 2 years; Enrollment period: 21 months; Duration of&#xD;
      each patient's participation: 3 months; Number of participating study sites: 15. Study sites&#xD;
      were chosen on the basis of the blood culture system used, of there having been &gt; 10&#xD;
      methicillin-resistant S. aureus blood cultures in 2009 and the possibility of setting up&#xD;
      rapid diagnosis for the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A two-person team consisting of a bacteriologist and a clinician will be responsible for&#xD;
      [screening], [enrollment] [and] [randomization] at [each] study site.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mean number of patients enrolled per month per site: 1-5.&#xD;
