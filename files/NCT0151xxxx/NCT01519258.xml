  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Neurally-Adjusted Ventilatory Assist (NAVA) is a ventilatory mode that uses the electrical&#xD;
      activity of the diaphragm to control the mechanical ventilator, offering inspiratory&#xD;
      assistance in proportion to respiratory effort to patients who need artificial ventilatory&#xD;
      support. It has been shown to improve the interaction between the patient and the mechanical&#xD;
      ventilator in several clinical situations, but no previous studies have tried to use it for&#xD;
      patients with a severe type of respiratory insufficiency, called Acute Respiratory Distress&#xD;
      Syndrome (ARDS). Patients with ARDS benefit from a mechanical ventilatory strategy that&#xD;
      includes low inspiratory volumes (tidal volumes) and limited airway pressures, but the&#xD;
      application of such strategy frequently requires high levels of sedation. The investigators'&#xD;
      hypothesis is that NAVA can be used for patients with ARDS, and that it will not be&#xD;
      associated with excessive tidal volumes or elevated airway pressures.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Neurally Adjusted ventilatory-Assist(NAVA) is an assisted ventilatory mode that captures the&#xD;
      electrical activity of the diaphragm and uses it to initiate and terminate the inspiratory&#xD;
      phase, offering inspiratory assistance in proportion to patient effort, cycle by cycle.&#xD;
      Studies in animals and humans have shown that NAVA reduces the work of breathing and improves&#xD;
      patient-ventilator interaction in comparison with traditional modes. Because it is an&#xD;
      assisted mode, its use requires less sedation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The use of NAVA could contribute to the reduction of complications of prolonged mechanical&#xD;
      ventilation in patients with Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) submitted to&#xD;
      protective ventilation with low tidal volumes and limited plateau pressure. However, there&#xD;
      are no studies with NAVA in the acute phase of ARDS, in which assisted-controlled modes are&#xD;
      generally used, allowing for adjustment of tidal volume and/or plateau pressure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With this project, the investigators intend to evaluate the behavior of NAVA mode in the&#xD;
      acute phase of mechanical ventilation in ARDS patients, to assess whether this mode can be&#xD;
      used to deliver an assisted lung protective ventilation strategy.&#xD;
