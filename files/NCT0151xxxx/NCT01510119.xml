    <textblock>
      This is an open labeled phase I dose escalation study of hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) and RAD001&#xD;
      in patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma followed by a Phase II trial of RAD001 with&#xD;
      HCQ. The target population are patients with one to three prior treatments for advanced renal&#xD;
      cell carcinoma. In the phase I portion a traditional 3+3 design will be used to determine the&#xD;
      maximal tolerated dose and/or recommended phase II dose for HCQ in combination with RAD001 po&#xD;
      10 mg/day.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This protocol describes a multicenter phase I/II trial of RAD001 in combination with&#xD;
      hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) (phase I anticipated n=6-12) with a 35 patient phase II trial in&#xD;
      patients with previously treated (1-3 prior regimens) advanced renal cell carcinoma. The&#xD;
      preclinical rationale for this combination is extensive, the safety of HCQ combination&#xD;
      strategies has been established, and effective autophagy pharmacodynamics (PD), and&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics (PK) assays are available to guide development. The practical advantage of&#xD;
      combination with HCQ is that this drug is off patent, commercially available, and is&#xD;
      investigational new drug (IND) exempt. The institutions involved have combined 11 clinical&#xD;
      protocols open for accrual involving HCQ, so regulatory approval will be rapid. There are no&#xD;
      competing HCQ protocols for advanced renal cell carcinoma. As described in the sample size&#xD;
      justification we are setting a high threshold to consider RAD001 + HCQ active since there are&#xD;
      many competitors and other potential rational combinations. The 35 patient sample size is&#xD;
      designed as a 2 stage phase II trial that will guide the go/no-go decision regarding the&#xD;
      conduct of a followup randomized study to definitively prove efficacy. The primary (6 month&#xD;
      PFS) and secondary outcomes (response rate, toxicity rates, correlative endpoints) will be&#xD;
      analyzed for the entire group, and for patient populations stratified by number of prior&#xD;
      therapies. The phase I portion of this trial is anticipated to be short, based on our&#xD;
      experience from other HCQ trials. As a safety measure we have included intermediate dose&#xD;
      levels which will only be used if there are Dose Limiting Toxicities (DLTs). Since we have&#xD;
      seen responses at lower doses of HCQ in other trials, and because frequently over months HCQ&#xD;
      dose is lowered from Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) doses in many trials because of nausea and&#xD;
      anorexia, we would like to have some data on renal cell patients treated at the lower dose&#xD;
      levels. If there is activity demonstrated at lower doses, this would be informative for dose&#xD;
      modification decisions in patients treated on the dose expansion. The patient population for&#xD;
      this trial, including the phase I dose escalation portion is advanced renal cell carcinoma&#xD;
      with 1-3 prior treatments.&#xD;
