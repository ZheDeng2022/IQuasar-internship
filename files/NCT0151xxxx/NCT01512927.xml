  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The incidence and prevalence of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) in Taiwan are both the highest&#xD;
      worldwide from 2001 to 2008. In Taiwan, more than 90% of the ESRD patients are hemodialysis&#xD;
      patients. Either arteriovenous fistula (AVF) or arteriovenous graft (AV graft) is essential&#xD;
      for the vascular access of these patients. However, frequent AVF stenosis or thrombosis&#xD;
      occurs in 10-30% hemodialytic patients, and the rates are even higher, around 30-70%, in&#xD;
      those who has a past history of AVF/AV graft stenosis. Therefore, early detection of AVF&#xD;
      stenosis is essential in caring for these hemodialysis patients in terms of medical economics&#xD;
      and psychological impact. Unfortunately, angiographic study is expensive and invasive and&#xD;
      needs contrast medium injection. The diagnostic accuracy of color duplex ultrasound in AVF&#xD;
      stenosis remains satisfactory, but it is not always available when decreased AVF flow or an&#xD;
      acute thrombotic event occurs. Continuous AVF/ AV graft flow monitoring by patient himself is&#xD;
      a better option in terms of long-term care. Previous study indicated that stethoscope&#xD;
      waveform analysis could be used as an alternative to diagnosis of vascular stenosis.&#xD;
      Therefore, we aim to investigate AVF/ AV graft stenosis by using the electronic stethoscope&#xD;
      (3M Littmann) for AVF sound recording, followed by software analysis by using waveform&#xD;
      decomposition, principle component analysis (PCA) and sequential forward selection algorithm&#xD;
      [xx]. Our study results will provide a new diagnostic option, which is low cost, non-invasive&#xD;
      and self-monitoring, of AVF stenosis in ESRD patients.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Hemodialysis is a well-established method for removal of fluid and uremic toxins and&#xD;
      prolonging survival in patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD). The most common&#xD;
      permanent vascular assesses are autogenous and non-autogenous arteriovenous (AV) fistula,&#xD;
      referred as AV fistula and AV graft, respectively. In Taiwan, both incidence and prevalence&#xD;
      of ESRD remain highest worldwide. However, frequent vascular stenosis/ thrombosis events&#xD;
      occurred because of repeated needle punctures. These will exert a large economic burden to&#xD;
      our society and psychological impacts on ESRD patients [1]. Therefore, it is essential to&#xD;
      develop an easy and patient-centered method to monitor the flow status in either AV fistula&#xD;
      or AV graft.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physical examination and auscultation are simple monitoring methods to assess the vascular&#xD;
      access. There were several signs reported to be associated vascular stenosis, such as&#xD;
      prolonged bleeding, arm edema, and changes in pulse characteristics of the vascular access,&#xD;
      but they need a high level of skill and experience from the operator, such as doctors and&#xD;
      nurses [2].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Unfortunately, angiographic study is expensive and invasive and needs contrast medium&#xD;
      injection. The diagnostic accuracy of color duplex ultrasound in AVF stenosis remains&#xD;
      satisfactory, but it is not always available when decreased AVF flow or an acute thrombotic&#xD;
      event occurs. Continuous AVF/ AV graft flow monitoring by patient himself is a better option&#xD;
      in terms of long-term care. Previous study indicated that stethoscope waveform analysis could&#xD;
      be used as an alternative to diagnosis of vascular stenosis. Previous acoustic studies&#xD;
      indicated that increased sound intensity, extra sounds, and higher spectral energy&#xD;
      infrequency domain, ranging between 300 Hz and 1000 Hz. These findings are associated with&#xD;
      the change from laminar flow to turbulent flow downstream the site of vascular stenosis [3].&#xD;
      In addition, phonoangiography studies pointed out that the systolic peak of stenotic segment&#xD;
      is higher and narrower in the time domain compared to non-stenotic segment Methods: This is&#xD;
      an observational cohort study. We plan to recruit 150 eligible patients with ESRD under&#xD;
      regular hemodialysis for at least one year in national Taiwan University Hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Data gathering A. The first group of patients (study group) will be recruited from hose&#xD;
           referred to endovascular intervention, e.g. angioplasty, due to vascular access&#xD;
           dysfunction (n=30). An electronic stethoscope (3M-Littmann) will be used to record&#xD;
           digital sound signals at 5 points with 30 seconds each, including AV junction, proximal&#xD;
           and distal to both needle puncture sites, respectively. All data will be transferred to&#xD;
           a computer for further anlaysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
           B. The second group (validation cohort) will be recruited from patients with regular&#xD;
           hemodialysis (HD) and received angioplasty at National Taiwan University Hospital&#xD;
           (n=120). Those patients who received angioplasty for AVF or AV graft stenosis will also&#xD;
           received follow-up angiography 12 weeks after angioplasty. We will record digital AVF/AV&#xD;
           graft sound signals as mentioned above. In addition, blood pressure and AVF/AVG venous&#xD;
           pressure, heart rate will be recorded. Diameter stenosis of restenotic segment will also&#xD;
           be recorded and a diameter stenosis of 50% is regarded as significant.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Post-processing The proposed method is based on the analysis of the envelope of the&#xD;
           sound signals. Before, calculating the envelope, all signals will be down-sampled to 2k&#xD;
           Hz, followed by a linear-phase, finite impulse response low-pass filter. PCA will then&#xD;
           be applied to analysis as described previously [1-4]. PCA (principal components&#xD;
           analysis)&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Analysis Sensitivity, specificity and diagnostic accuracy will be calculated based on&#xD;
           each diagnostic criteria or basal function. Area under ROC curve will be calculated&#xD;
           based on each diagnostic criteria derived from PCA method.&#xD;
