      Hepatitis C virus (HCV)-related liver disease is the most common indication for liver&#xD;
      transplantation (LT). However, LT does not cure the infection, and therapeutic strategies&#xD;
      resulted in very limited efficacy and tolerability in LT recipients. In view of its&#xD;
      postulated safety profile, Silibinin seems an ideal drug to be used in the setting of HCV&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Hepatitis C virus (HCV)-related liver disease continues to be the most common indication for&#xD;
      liver transplantation (LT) in both the United States and Europe. However, LT does not cure&#xD;
      the infection, and re-infection of the liver allograft universally occurs. Recurrent HCV&#xD;
      hepatitis often follows an accelerated course after LT, and histological recurrence occurs in&#xD;
      approximately 50% of patients within 1 year after LT; 15-30% of them develop cirrhosis within&#xD;
      5 years. In this context, a peculiar feature is represented by the rapid course of liver&#xD;
      fibrosis. Therapeutic strategies for managing the primary cause of liver damage, i.e. HCV&#xD;
      infection, irrespective of application in pre-, peri-, and/or post-LT periods resulted in&#xD;
      very limited efficacy and tolerability in LT recipients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In view of its postulated safety profile, Silibinin seems an ideal drug to be used in the&#xD;
      setting of HCV recurrent patients after liver transplantation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Silibinin, a flavonolignan representing the main component (60%) of Silymarin and proposed as&#xD;
      an anti-hepatotoxic agent for the treatment of various liver diseases has been recently&#xD;
      reported to beneficially modulate the pro-fibrogenic potential of HSC, thus representing a&#xD;
      very attractive possibility in the transplanted population. Besides the anti-inflammatory&#xD;
      properties, Silibinin is able to inhibit Tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α). This is a&#xD;
      proinflammatory cytokine with a major role in both acute and chronic viral, bacterial and&#xD;
      fungal infections.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective is to determine the effect of post-transplant treatment with Legalon&#xD;
      SIL on HCV viral load 30 days after the beginning of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      44 stable liver transplanted patients with HCV recurrence will be randomized 3:1 to receive&#xD;
      Legalon-SIL or Placebo. Randomized patients will be treated for 14 consecutive days with&#xD;
      Legalon-SIL or Placebo. Patients dropping-out before the end of treatment period will be&#xD;
      replaced.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be followed up for 1 year to monitor the effect of treatment on liver fibrosis,&#xD;
      liver functional state, lymphocyte activation, and viral load.&#xD;
