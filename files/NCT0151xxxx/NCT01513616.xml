  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Dyspnea (respiratory discomfort) and activity limitation are the most common symptoms of&#xD;
      chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and contribute importantly to a perceived poor&#xD;
      quality of life. Recent international guidelines have stressed the importance of dyspnea&#xD;
      alleviation and improvement exercise tolerance as a means of enhancing quality of life and&#xD;
      other long term outcomes in this population. Modern pharmacotherapy is the first step in&#xD;
      symptom management but the overall impact of bronchodilator therapy is relatively small.&#xD;
      Exercise training remains the most effective treatment for ameliorating dyspnea and improving&#xD;
      exercise endurance and was the main focus of this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objectives of the study were:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To conduct and compare detailed studies of respiratory mechanics during cycle exercise&#xD;
           before and after exercise training (EXT) compared with an untrained control group. By&#xD;
           multiple regression analysis, the investigators will establish the main contributors to&#xD;
           dyspnea relief after EXT.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To compare the magnitude of change in endurance during constant work rate cycle exercise&#xD;
           with those measured during walk tests and the endurance shuttle walk test after EXT&#xD;
           relative to control. To evaluate which test (constant work rate cycle, six-minute walk&#xD;
           test, or endurance shuttle walk test) is the most sensitive test for measuring changes&#xD;
           in endurance after EXT versus control.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To compare the change in standardized dyspnea ratings (Borg Scale) during constant-load&#xD;
           cycling with a variety of other activity-related dyspnea questionnaires. To evaluate&#xD;
           which of these measurements is the most sensitive for examining changes in perceived&#xD;
           discomfort during exercise.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To evaluate the contribution of psychological factors (anxiety, fear, respiratory panic,&#xD;
           self-efficacy) to the perceived improvement of symptoms following EXT. The investigators&#xD;
           will use multiple regression analysis to examine associations between changes in&#xD;
           perceived dyspnea and changes in anxiety and self-efficacy measured by validated&#xD;
           questionnaires and Borg intensity ratings?&#xD;
