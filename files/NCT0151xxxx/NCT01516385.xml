      This research looks for markers in the blood of people with spinal cord injury that may be a&#xD;
      sign of injury severity, or serve as a clue to the degree of recovery. Investigators would&#xD;
      also like to compare the marker profile of these patient with that of other neurological&#xD;
      conditions such as stroke and Guillain-Barre syndrome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients participating in this trial will be those accepted to neuro-rehabilitation in Sheba&#xD;
      medical center, Israel. They will join the trial at their arrival to the ward, no less than 2&#xD;
      week after the beginning of their condition, but no later than 3 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be examined by the research staff three times:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. At arrival, the patients will be neurologically examined and their functional abilities&#xD;
           will be assessed. Blood will be drawn and sent to the lab.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. At 6 months after the beginning of the neurological condition the same will be repeated:&#xD;
           the patients will be neurologically examined and their functional abilities will be&#xD;
           assessed, and blood will be drawn and sent to the lab.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. The final examination will take place 1 year after the beginning of the neurological&#xD;
           condition. This time only the neurological and functional abilities will be assessed&#xD;
           without blood tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The blood samples will be tested in the research lab. Then investigators shall compare the&#xD;
      clinical findings with the laboratory findings, and see if any of the markers found reflect&#xD;
      the injury severity or predict the recovery.&#xD;
