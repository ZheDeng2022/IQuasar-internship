      This was an open-label, balanced, randomized, two-treatment, two-sequence, two-period, single&#xD;
      dose, crossover bioequivalence study in healthy, adult, human, male subjects under fed&#xD;
      conditions.64 healthy male adults were enrolled.A washout period of 07 days was maintained&#xD;
      between the successive dosing days.One capsule containing mycophenolate mofetil 250 mg was&#xD;
      administered orally with 240 mL water in sitting posture, after an overnight fast of at least&#xD;
      10 hours in each period. This activity was followed by a mouth check to assess compliance to&#xD;
      dosing. The subjects were not allowed to lie down for the first two hours after dosing.&#xD;
