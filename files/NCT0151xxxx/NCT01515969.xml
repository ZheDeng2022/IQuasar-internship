    <textblock>
      This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of giving erlotinib and dovitinib&#xD;
      together to treat patients with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer. Erlotinib blocks the&#xD;
      epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and has known activity in non-small cell lung cancer&#xD;
      and dovitinib blocks the fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) and other targets which may&#xD;
      be important to treat lung cancer. The combination of both drugs may work better than either&#xD;
      drug alone, but may also have increased side effects. This trial will look at the side&#xD;
      effects of combining the drugs and look for how effective the combination may be.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To characterize the safety and tolerability of the combination of erlotinib (erlotinib&#xD;
      hydrochloride) and dovitinib (dovitinib lactate), assessing for toxicity using the Common&#xD;
      Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.0.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of the combination of erlotinib and&#xD;
      dovitinib.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate overall response rate (ORR), progression free survival (PFS), and overall&#xD;
      survival (OS) of patients receiving the combination of erlotinib and dovitinib, although this&#xD;
      phase will allow for patients who received any number of prior treatments, including prior&#xD;
      treatment with erlotinib.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To evaluate the potential impact of dovitinib on erlotinib pharmacokinetics (PK).&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive erlotinib hydrochloride orally (PO) once daily (QD). Starting on day 15,&#xD;
      patients also receive dovitinib lactate PO QD on days 1-5 of each week. Treatment continues&#xD;
      in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 12 months.&#xD;
