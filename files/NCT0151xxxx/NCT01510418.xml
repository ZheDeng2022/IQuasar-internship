  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this pilot study is to understand the socialization of adult men with hemophilia&#xD;
      living in the United States and their quality of life in order to improve comprehensive care&#xD;
      for persons with congenital bleeding disorders. Studies in Europe suggest that despite&#xD;
      medical, surgical, and biotechnology advances in care for persons with the congenital&#xD;
      bleeding disorders hemophilia A and B, men with hemophilia have earlier work disability and&#xD;
      health-related lower quality of life than men of the same age who do not have hemophilia in&#xD;
      the general population. Congenital bleeding disorders are known to have medical and&#xD;
      psychosocial impact not only in school but also in other activities, e.g. participation in&#xD;
      sports beginning at a young age. The psychosocial impact of living with a congenital bleeding&#xD;
      disorder has been studied and described in childhood. The support relationships in childhood&#xD;
      include parents and primary family of origin and these supports are generally considered in&#xD;
      pediatric comprehensive care models. Support relationships in adulthood have not been well&#xD;
      described or studied. The role of spouse and significant others (SSO) of PWCBD in health care&#xD;
      is of interest for the delivery of adult comprehensive care as well as to understand their&#xD;
      contribution to the health-related quality of life of PWCBD. Additionally, this study seeks&#xD;
      to learn of the impact of congenital bleeding disorders for the SSO. The study uses&#xD;
      self-reported medical and social information questionnaires, health-related quality of life&#xD;
      surveys, and confidential interview. Results of this study may guide how comprehensive care&#xD;
      and support are provided to adult persons with congenital bleeding disorders by hemophilia&#xD;
      treatment programs. This study focuses on PWCBD with hemophilia A or B as a model for the&#xD;
      experience of persons with other congenital bleeding disorders.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There are two groups (cohorts) in this study. One group is adult men with congenital&#xD;
      hemophilia A or B who qualify for the study. The other group is their spouse or significant&#xD;
      other (SSO) who are voluntarily identified by the person with congenital bleeding disorder&#xD;
      for recruitment into the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the adult men with congenital hemophilia A or B, the study involves a minimum of 2 visits&#xD;
      and includes screening, medical history and physical exam review, completing confidential&#xD;
      questionnaires and interview.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible men with congenital hemophilia A or B (person with congenital bleeding disorder,&#xD;
      PWCBD) are given the option to permit the investigator to contact their spouse or significant&#xD;
      other (SSO) for participation in the study. If PWCBD has an SSO, the SSO is not required to&#xD;
      participate in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Spouse/significant other(SSO)of men with congenital hemophilia A or B may enter the study&#xD;
      only if they have been voluntarily identified by their partner (PWCBD) and their partner has&#xD;
      opted to allow investigator to contact them. For the SSO who chooses to participate in the&#xD;
      study, the study will involve a minimum of one visit and includes completing confidential&#xD;
      questionnaires and interview.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participation including questionnaires and interview information collected is&#xD;
      confidential and protected by health privacy information laws and records are de-identified.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is sponsored by a grant from The National Hemophilia Foundation.&#xD;
