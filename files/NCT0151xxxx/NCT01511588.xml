      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - The body produces gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) about every 2 hours. GnRH travels&#xD;
      through the bloodstream to the pituitary gland, where it stimulates the gland to produce&#xD;
      hormones called gonadotropins. These hormones stimulate the testicles or ovaries. The&#xD;
      testicles produce testosterone and develop sperm. The ovaries produce estrogen and prepare&#xD;
      for ovulation. Normal estrogen and testosterone levels are required for puberty. Some people,&#xD;
      however, have either low levels or total lack of GnRH. This can cause problems with puberty&#xD;
      and fertility. Researchers want to study people with low or no GnRH to better understand how&#xD;
      it affects puberty and fertility.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To study disorders of GnRH production.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Adult men and women at least 18 years of age with low or no gonadotropin levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Adolescents between 14 and 18 years of age with low or no gonadotropin levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be screened with a physical exam and medical history. Blood and urine&#xD;
           samples will be collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will have tests to look at their hormone levels. Blood samples may be&#xD;
           collected after taking different drugs, including insulin and cortisone. A 24-hour urine&#xD;
           sample will be collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will have imaging studies to look at bone and brain development. They will&#xD;
           also have ultrasounds of the kidneys, abdomen, and reproductive organs.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Tests of smell and hearing will be used to look for abnormalities in these senses.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The key initiating factors for reproductive development remain among the great mysteries of&#xD;
      pediatric and reproductive endocrinology. The onset of puberty is initiated by pulsatile&#xD;
      secretion of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) from the hypothalamus. GnRH secretion is&#xD;
      fully active during the neonatal period, quiescent throughout most of childhood, and is&#xD;
      reactivated at the time of puberty to induce sexual maturation and subsequent fertility. The&#xD;
      neuroendocrine events leading to increased GnRH secretion and the resultant onset of puberty&#xD;
      remain largely unknown.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Isolated deficiency of GnRH results in the rare clinical syndrome of idiopathic&#xD;
      hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (IHH), where decreased secretion of GnRH results in impaired&#xD;
      gonadotropin secretion. The resultant hypogonadism presents with delayed, incomplete, or&#xD;
      absent sexual maturation. In addition, non-reproductive phenotypes of this spectrum have been&#xD;
      identified in some individuals, including anosmia, auditory defects, skeletal and renal&#xD;
      anomalies. More severe syndromic forms of IHH have also been associated with rare congenital&#xD;
      malformations, such as the Bosma arhinia microphthalmia (BAM) syndrome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Defining the physiology of GnRH is critical to understanding the clinical heterogeneity of&#xD;
      isolated GnRH deficiency, particularly in light of emerging gene discoveries that elucidate&#xD;
      genotype-phenotype correlations. Careful human phenotyping of patients with mutations in&#xD;
      genes known to cause IHH has provided insight into developmental pathways involved in the&#xD;
      ontogeny of GnRH neurons, but the neuroendocrine regulation of this system is not well&#xD;
      understood.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will phenotypically characterize subjects with IHH, including severe syndromic forms. We&#xD;
      plan to admit males and females 14 years of age or older with clinical signs suggestive of&#xD;
      IHH for comprehensive phenotyping to include neuroendocrine profiling via an LH pulsatility&#xD;
      study, as well as identification of other non-reproductive findings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This protocol will utilize the disease model of IHH to increase our understanding of the&#xD;
      physiology of GnRH secretion, including the neuroendocrine regulation of GnRH pulsatility, as&#xD;
      well as other unknown aspects of GnRH biology, which may be illuminated through the&#xD;
      non-reproductive characteristics of these patients. Examining the baseline characteristics of&#xD;
      subjects with isolated GnRH deficiency will reveal insights into the mechanisms underlying&#xD;
      the reawakening of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis at puberty, providing&#xD;
      opportunities for new diagnostic capabilities and therapeutic interventions for disorders of&#xD;
      puberty and fertility.&#xD;

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Since hypogonadotropic hypogonadism is a rare condition, with an incidence of 1/10,000 to&#xD;
        1/86,000 for isolated GnRH deficiency (34, 35), this protocol remains open to enrollment so&#xD;
        that we may study all subjects that are both qualified and interested in participating.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Males or females who are greater than or equal to 14 years old with clinical findings of HH&#xD;
        as outlined above will be included. In certain circumstances, a patient under the age of 14&#xD;
        years may be considered for baseline evaluation if there is sufficient evidence suggestive&#xD;
        of HH, such as any two of the following: anosmia, history of cryptorchidism or&#xD;
        microphallus.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -Because HH represents a spectrum, where associated clinical findings may provide&#xD;
        phenotypic clues to the assessment of inheritability and underlying physiology, exclusion&#xD;
        criteria are very limited:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have additional pituitary deficiencies, effectively ruling out isolated&#xD;
             GnRH deficiency, whether these deficiencies are congenital or acquired (e.g. secondary&#xD;
             to malignancy, infection, or irradiation).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who are taking medications known to cause HH, such as corticosteroids or&#xD;
             continuous opiate administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnancy or lactation&#xD;
