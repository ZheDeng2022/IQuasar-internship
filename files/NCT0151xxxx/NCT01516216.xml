  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Vitamin D receptor is found in colon cancer cells. When Vitamin D binds to the receptor&#xD;
      in the cancer cells, it may stop cancer cells from growing abnormally and may cause cell&#xD;
      death. Vitamin D has been used in other research studies and information from those other&#xD;
      research studies suggests that Vitamin D may help in the treatment of colorectal cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this research study, the investigators are comparing standard and higher dose Vitamin D&#xD;
      treatment when given in combination with standard treatment for metastatic colorectal cancer.&#xD;
      Standard treatment includes the chemotherapy combination of 5-FU, Leucovorin and Oxaliplatin&#xD;
      (FOLFOX) with bevacizumab.&#xD;

      Participants will be randomized into one of the study groups-Arm A: Vitamin D (standard dose&#xD;
      of 400 IU/day), FOLFOX and Bevacizumab or Arm B: Vitamin D (higher dose of 8000 IU/day for 2&#xD;
      weeks followed by 4000 IU/day), FOLFOX and Bevacizumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Treatment (A cycle of treatment is 14 days):&#xD;
&#xD;
      Vitamin D&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cycle 1: You will take two capsules of Vitamin D orally, once a day (at the same time), every&#xD;
      day. Participants randomized to Arm A will be taking one capsule with 400 IU of Vitamin D and&#xD;
      one capsule with placebo (pills with no medicine) so that neither you nor your doctor will&#xD;
      know what group you have been assigned to. Participants randomized to Arm B will be taking&#xD;
      two capsules of 4000 IU each.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subsequent Cycles: You will take one capsule orally, once a day (at the same time), every&#xD;
      day. Participants randomized to Arm A will be taking one capsule with 400 IU of Vitamin D.&#xD;
      Participants randomized to Arm B will be taking one capsule with 4000 IU of Vitamin D.&#xD;
&#xD;
      FOLFOX and bevacizumab&#xD;
&#xD;
      FOLFOX and bevacizumab will be given intravenously (IV, through a vein in your arm) on Day 1&#xD;
      of every cycle for all participants in both Arms A and B. The infusions will take several&#xD;
      hours, in addition to your doctor's visit, so you should plan on being in clinic most of the&#xD;
      day. Note that the 5-FU is given bolus on day 1 (given as one dose), and is then given as a&#xD;
      continuous IV infusion over 2 days. You will need to have a port-a-cath placed. A port-a-cath&#xD;
      is a medical device that is placed under the skin. The continuous infusion is delivered by a&#xD;
      pump that is inserted into the port-a-cath. The pump will be carried in a pouch that you can&#xD;
      hook around your waist. Arrangements will be made for you to have the pump disconnected after&#xD;
      2 days. You may need to return to clinic to have it disconnected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While on study, the following tests and procedures will be performed:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cycle 1, Day 1&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Questions about your health, current medications and any allergies.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Physical exam, including vital signs&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Performance status&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Routine blood tests to evaluate your health&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Urine test&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subsequent Cycles, Day 1&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Questions about your health, current medications, allergies and any side effects you may&#xD;
           be having.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Physical exam, including vital signs&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Performance status&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Routine blood tests to evaluate your health&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Urine test&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Review of your study drug diary (please bring with you every visit).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Every 4 cycles (approximately every 8 weeks): An assessment of your tumor by CT scan or MRI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additional blood samples for research: Samples will be drawn (a little more than 1 teaspoon&#xD;
      of blood) after Cycle 4, Cycle 8 and then every 8 Cycles thereafter.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will continue to receive treatment as long as your disease does not get worse and you are&#xD;
      tolerating the treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      End of treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Questions about your health, current medications and any allergies.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Physical exam, including vital signs&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Performance status&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood tests (routine blood tests to evaluate your health and a blood sample for&#xD;
           research)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Urine test&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  An assessment of your tumor by CT scan or MRI&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the final dose of the study drug:&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will be followed for safety reasons for 30 days after the last dose of study drug. If you&#xD;
      are experiencing side effects, you may continue to be followed until the side effects resolve&#xD;
      or until you start another treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you discontinue study treatment for reasons other than disease progression (for example,&#xD;
      side effects), you will be asked to continue to get tumor assessments every 8 - 16 weeks&#xD;
      until your disease worsens as demonstrated by a tumor assessment or until you start another&#xD;
      therapy to treat your cancer. These assessments may coincide with your routine follow-up, in&#xD;
      which case they would not need to be repeated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We would like to keep track of your medical condition for the rest of your life. We would&#xD;
      like to do this by reviewing your medical records and/or by calling you on the telephone&#xD;
      every 3 months to see how you are doing. Keeping in touch with you and checking on your&#xD;
      condition helps us look at the long-term effects of the research study.&#xD;
