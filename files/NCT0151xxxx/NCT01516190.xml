  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to look at the changes that occur in women who take part in exercise&#xD;
      and Mind-Body programs between breast cancer diagnosis and breast surgery. The investigators&#xD;
      will look at changes in stress, anxiety, mood and quality of life, to see if these types of&#xD;
      short programs can make women feel better during this time. The investigators are also&#xD;
      interested in looking at whether a short exercise or Mind-Body program leads to any changes&#xD;
      in markers in breast cancer cells, such as their growth and death rates, or in blood hormones&#xD;
      such as insulin, which have been linked to breast cancer development.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since the investigators do not know if these blood or tumor tests have any relationship to&#xD;
      cancer recurrence, the investigators do not plan to share the results of these tests with you&#xD;
      or your physician.&#xD;
