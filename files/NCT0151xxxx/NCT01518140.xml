    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical research study is to learn if 3 breathing devices reduce feeling&#xD;
      short of breath in cancer patients. Researchers also want to learn if these devices can help&#xD;
      to control shortness of breath.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Device A is designed to get more air in and out of their lungs without using as much effort&#xD;
      as regular breathing. The air is given through a mask, and the amount of air can be set to&#xD;
      different levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Device B is designed to deliver air in and out of the lungs. The air is warmed, filtered for&#xD;
      bacteria, and then delivered through the nose using a tube under the nostrils.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Device C is designed to deliver air in and out of the lungs. The air is given through a mask,&#xD;
      and the amount of air can be set to different levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Groups and Device Use:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will be randomly assigned (as&#xD;
      in the roll of dice) to 1 of 3 groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If you are in Group 1, you will receive air through Device A for 1 hour, and then on an&#xD;
           &quot;as needed&quot; basis for up to 4 hours. Then you will receive air through Device B for up&#xD;
           to 30 minutes, followed by 30 minutes using Device C.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If you are in Group 2, you will receive air through Device B for 1 hour, and then on an&#xD;
           as needed basis for up to 4 hours. Then you will receive air through Device A for up to&#xD;
           30 minutes, followed by 30 minutes using Device C.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If you are in Group 3, you will receive air through Device C for 1 hour, and then on an&#xD;
           as needed basis for up to 4 hours. Then you will receive air through Device A for up to&#xD;
           30 minutes, followed by 30 minutes using Device B.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study staff will help you use the devices. The maximum time allowed using the 3 devices&#xD;
      is 6 hours total.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the &quot;as needed&quot; use period (4 hours), you will switch between the device you were&#xD;
      assigned to and the same air delivery device and oxygen level that you were using just before&#xD;
      you started the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Visit:&#xD;
&#xD;
      During your study visit, the following tests and procedures will be performed:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  From your medical record, the study staff will collect information about your age, sex,&#xD;
           race, disease type, how well you are able to perform the normal activities of daily&#xD;
           living, any drugs you are taking, and possible causes of shortness of breath.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will complete 2 questionnaires. The first asks about breathing symptoms, and the&#xD;
           second asks about other symptoms you may be having. It should take about 15 minutes to&#xD;
           complete these questionnaires.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Your heart rate, breathing rate, and blood pressure will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The level of air you breathe out will be recorded using a measuring device on your&#xD;
           chest.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Before and after using the devices, you will be asked how hard it is to catch your&#xD;
           breath and about any side effects you may be having.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  At the end of the visit, you will fill out a questionnaire that asks about which device&#xD;
           you prefer. It should take about 5 minutes to complete this questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Length of Study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will be on this study for up to 6 hours. You will be taken off study and the device will&#xD;
      be stopped if intolerable side effects occur while using a study device.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an investigational study. The 3 breathing devices are commercially available and FDA&#xD;
      approved for delivering oxygen when medically needed, including in cancer patients. It is&#xD;
      investigational to collect information from patients to rate how well the study devices may&#xD;
      affect shortness of breath.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 90 patients will be enrolled in this study. All will be enrolled at MD Anderson.&#xD;

    <description>Maximal inspiratory pressure measured at baseline, at end of the first hour, and after 4 hours of as-needed intervention using the NS 120-TRR negative inspiratory force monitor. Five consecutive efforts will be recorded, with a 1-minute pause between each effort (Ha-rik-Khan et al. 1998). Participants asked to rank the breathing devices based on their (1) efficacy in helping them to breathe, (2) comfort, and (3) ease of use on a numeric rating scale from 0 (best) to 10 (worst).</description>
