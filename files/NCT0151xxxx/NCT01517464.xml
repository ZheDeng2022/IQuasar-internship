  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase I study designed to evaluate the safety and maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of&#xD;
      SGT-94, a novel, tumor-targeted, systemic gene therapy agent for cancer. In addition, we will&#xD;
      look for evidence of RB94 expression within tumor tissue after systemic administration of&#xD;
      SGT-94.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      RB94, a tumor suppressor gene, is a modified form of the retinoblastoma gene, RB110. RB94 has&#xD;
      shown enhanced tumor suppressor and tumor cell killing activity compared to RB110 in all&#xD;
      tumor cell types studied to date, including bladder cancer cell lines. Moreover, RB94 has&#xD;
      shown no toxicity to any normal human cells tested.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SGT-94,the agent being tested, is a systemically administered complex composed of the RB94&#xD;
      gene (plasmid DNA)encapsulated in a liposome that is targeted to tumor cells by means of an&#xD;
      anti-transferrin receptor single chain antibody fragment (TfRscFv)attached to the outside of&#xD;
      the liposome. Pre-clinical in vivo efficacy studies have indicated that SGT-94, when&#xD;
      systemically administered, preferentially targets tumor cells and efficiently transfects&#xD;
      them. This results in cancer cell death via mechanisms that are unique for RB94 and also&#xD;
      increases the tumor's response to conventional radiation and chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This Phase I study is designed to evaluate the safety of SGT-94 and to establish a&#xD;
      practically attainable and/or tolerable dose of this anti-cancer agent for use in further&#xD;
      clinical trials. Additionally, evidence of RB94 expression within tumor tissue after systemic&#xD;
      administration of SGT-94 will be sought, and clinically observable anti-cancer effects in&#xD;
      patients will be documented. Enrollment will be targeted to individuals with &quot;RB negative&quot;&#xD;
      tumors, i.e. tumors in which there is no staining for RB protein by immunohistochemistry&#xD;
      (IHC). Preference will be given to patients with tumors in a location amenable to biopsy&#xD;
      following treatment with SGT-94. This would include the prostate, bladder, superficial lymph&#xD;
      nodes and any mass suitable for fine needle aspiration under CT or ultrasound guidance, or&#xD;
      any lesion reachable by endoscopy.&#xD;
