      The study hypothesis is that treatment with oral Testosterone according to the study regimen&#xD;
      will improve glycemic control in T2DM Chinese males in Singapore as indicated by a reduction&#xD;
      in HbA1c levels at study day 90.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single arm open label clinical study in Chinese men of 45 to 75 years of age with&#xD;
      Type 2 Diabetes. Subjects will be recruited from participating family medicine clinics with&#xD;
      the FMRN and followed for 90-days. All subjects will continue on pre-study treatment regimens&#xD;
      and medications as clinically indicated throughout the 90-day study period. Missed doses of&#xD;
      study drug can be made up within the same day. With the exceptions of study drug and diabetic&#xD;
      medications, changes in other medications will be permitted. The primary aim is to assess the&#xD;
      effects of oral Testosterone on change in HbA1c levels in the Chinese males with a diagnosis&#xD;
      of T2DM over a 90-day study period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects enrolled in the study will take two 40mg capsules of oral testosterone in the&#xD;
      morning and two 40mg capsules in the evening with meals on both occasions on each day. This&#xD;
      daily dosage is consistent with the recommended dosage for subjects being treated for&#xD;
      hypogonadism.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - The primary aim is to assess the effect of oral Testosterone on percent change in HbA1c in&#xD;
      T2DM Chinese males in Singapore over a 90-day study period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - The secondary aim is to assess the effects of site, eugonadism and hypogonadism, and the&#xD;
      prognostic relevance of baseline levels of HbA1c, total testosterone, PSA, IPSS, haemoglobin&#xD;
      and haematocrit on 90-day change and percent change from baseline in HbA1c under the study&#xD;
      Testosterone regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All subjects must satisfy ALL of the following criteria at study entry:&#xD;
&#xD;
