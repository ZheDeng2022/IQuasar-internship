    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter open label non randomized phase II clinical trial of Weekly Cabazitaxel&#xD;
      for Advanced Prostate Cancer in Hormone-Refractory Patients Previously Treated with&#xD;
      Docetaxel.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the activity of the weekly administration of&#xD;
      cabazitaxel as time to progression by PSA at week 12.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The efficacy of three-weekly cabazitaxel is accompanied by an appreciable rate of serious&#xD;
      side effects and toxic deaths. The toxicity rates observed, including grade III-IV&#xD;
      neutropenia, febrile neutropenia and diarrhea, could be an obstacle to the use and management&#xD;
      of a drug that, on the other hand, has demonstrated great activity. In the treatment of&#xD;
      patients with prostate cancer, who have a larger number of morbidities than patients with&#xD;
      breast cancer, we assume the risk that in the transition from clinical trial to clinical&#xD;
      practice the drug will not be used much because of the risk of side effects, cost, the&#xD;
      discomfort derived from the routine use of G-CSF and the lack of patient compliance with this&#xD;
      type of regimens.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rates of neuropathy, nail and conjunctive toxicity with this new taxane are not relevant,&#xD;
      which suggests that weekly administration will not produce relevant toxicity problems. Weekly&#xD;
      administration of other taxanes improved hematologic tolerance along with a better&#xD;
      therapeutic range in some cases, increasing the dose intensity and activity without&#xD;
      increasing the associated toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase I study has been reported studying weekly administration of cabazitaxel, recommended&#xD;
      dose is 10 mg/m2, administered on days 1, 8, 15 and 22 every 5 weeks in a 1-hour infusion,&#xD;
      being diarrhea the dose-limiting toxicity observed in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Given the pharmacokinetic characteristics of this taxane and its activity and toxicity&#xD;
      profile, cabazitaxel might be a good candidate for studying in a weekly administration&#xD;
      regimen in patients with prostate cancer with a greater risk of toxicity associated with&#xD;
      treatment every 3 weeks, such as patients who have received previous pelvic radiation therapy&#xD;
      that affects more than 25% of the bone marrow reserve, patients over 75 years with a worse&#xD;
      performance status (ECOG 2) or who have already experienced important hematologic toxicity in&#xD;
      the previous treatment with docetaxel.&#xD;
