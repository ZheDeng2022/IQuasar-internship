    <textblock>
      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Researchers want to collect information on diet, physical activity, and sun exposure in&#xD;
      children and young adults. The data can provide information on the effect these factors might&#xD;
      have on the development of cancer and other diseases. Information collected only from adults&#xD;
      does not accurately measure these factors. To collect more accurate information, both mothers&#xD;
      and children will provide information. Study participants will be from Hebei province in&#xD;
      northeastern China and Jiangsu province in eastern China.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To collect and study diet, activity, and sun exposure data from Chinese adolescents and&#xD;
      their mothers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Adolescents between 15 and 17 years of age from Hebei and Jiangsu provinces in China.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Mothers of the study adolescents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will answer questions about their diet, physical activity, and time in the&#xD;
           sun.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will wear a pedometer to measure activity for 7 days. They will also wear a&#xD;
           badge to measure sun exposure for 3 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will record their activities and food and drinks consumed for 3 days. Urine&#xD;
           samples will be collected for a full day.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will have a grip strength test. On the last day of the study, they will&#xD;
           provide blood, saliva, and toenail samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A smaller separate group of adolescents will provide saliva samples only and complete a&#xD;
           food questionnaire.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Emerging epidemiological evidence suggests that early-life exposures in conjunction with&#xD;
      genetic makeup and variability may be important in the etiology of many common adult cancers.&#xD;
      Prospectively collected information on adolescent and early adulthood exposures is lacking&#xD;
      and current evidence often relies on adult recall of the past with a limited array of&#xD;
      exposure variables.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Long Term Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To investigate the feasibility of assessing exposures that may be linked to early life&#xD;
           exposures and to later diseases. Exposures include diet, physical activity, UV-exposure,&#xD;
           DNAmethylation status, body size and reproductive factors. This feasibility work will&#xD;
           inform additional research in an existing large Chinese-U.S. CDC collaborative project&#xD;
           conducted in 1993 - 1995, the Community Intervention Program (CIP) (n = 247,000).&#xD;
&#xD;
           Short Term Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To determine the feasibility of collecting and assessing the quality of data on current&#xD;
           diet, nutritional status, physical activity, physical strength, UV exposure, DNA&#xD;
           methylation status and other environmental exposures as early life determinants of adult&#xD;
           cancer in adolescents 15 - 17 years of age and early adulthood in their mothers.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To assess differences in methylation status of DNA between those exposed to&#xD;
           periconceptional folic acid supplementation and those unexposed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To compare dietary and physical activity self-reporting instruments against objective&#xD;
           measures of dietary intake and physical activity, respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pairs of mothers and their children aged 15-17 years from the CIP, who completed an&#xD;
      associated pilot study in Laoting (Task 1), Hebei provincein the North, and Taicang, Jiangsu&#xD;
      provincein the South, and who agree to participate in the study. An additional subsample of&#xD;
      100 children who completed an accompanying study (Task 1), who agree to participate in a&#xD;
      sub-study will be eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This pilot study will include 100 pairs of children and their mothers recruited from 2&#xD;
      provinces. A total of 50 children (aged 16-17years) from a high school (grades 9-10) will be&#xD;
      identified in each province. To the extent possible, approximately equal numbers of children&#xD;
      aged 16 and 17 years of age will be recruited, stratified by gender and in utero exposure to&#xD;
      folic acid. An additional sub-sample of 100 children that completed an accompanying study&#xD;
      (Task 1) will be enrolled for only saliva collection and completion of a food frequency&#xD;
      questionnaire.&#xD;

        This is a pilot study of approximately 200 children and their mothers who had participated&#xD;
        in a prior study of 247,000 mother-child pairs in 1993 to 1995. The aim of the pilot is to&#xD;
        assess the feasibility of finding the subjects, assessing participation rates, and testing&#xD;
        instruments to measure diet, physical activity and ultraviolet radiation exposure.&#xD;
        Participants were identified from records documenting location of residence in the previous&#xD;
        study. They were approached by local medical staff to assess interest in participation for&#xD;
        the pilot study. The study involved 8 days of data collection as well as saliva and blood&#xD;
        collection. Results from the local hospital blood tests and the research sample were&#xD;
        provided to the participants by the local medical staff. Follow-up of the larger cohort&#xD;
        would be based on successful study protocol components or improved versions of the&#xD;
        instruments or logistics.&#xD;
