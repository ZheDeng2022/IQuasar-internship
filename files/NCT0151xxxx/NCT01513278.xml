  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The standard treatment for early-stage breast cancer is breast-conserving surgery followed by&#xD;
      adjuvant radiation therapy to the whole breast. This approach leads to low recurrence rates&#xD;
      with a good cosmesis and provides an effective alternative to mastectomy. However, in most&#xD;
      women receiving radiotherapy radiation dermatitis occur to some degree.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Radiation dermatitis generally manifests within a few weeks after the start of radiation&#xD;
      therapy. Its onset varies depending on the radiation dose intensity and the normal tissue&#xD;
      sensitivity of individuals. As the cumulative dose of radiation increases the transient&#xD;
      erythema occurring during the first weeks of radiotherapy may evolve into the more persistent&#xD;
      erythema and to dry or even moist desquamation that reflects the damage to the basal cell&#xD;
      layer and the sweat and sebaceous glands.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is currently no evidence that prophylactic treatments, beyond keeping the irradiated&#xD;
      area clean and dry, are effective in reducing the incidence or severity of radiation&#xD;
      dermatitis (Bolderston et al. 2006).&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, together with other enzymes of the peroxidase pathway, SOD scavenges the superoxide,&#xD;
      hydroxyl, and other oxygenated free radicals (Klug et al. 1972; Tainer at al. 1983). In&#xD;
      physiological conditions, the production of free radicals (Monte &amp; Sacerdote 1994) and the&#xD;
      action of antiradicals' enzymes is balanced. Following tissue injuries, either pathological&#xD;
      or caused by agents such as radiation therapy, an excess production of free radicals is&#xD;
      observed (Petkau 1986; Lorette &amp; Machet 2001). Furthermore, basal SOD is increased in breast&#xD;
      cancer patients before radiation therapy as compared to controls (Seth et al. 2003), and&#xD;
      decreases after radiotherapy (Ray at al. 2000). Hence, liposomal rhSOD applied during&#xD;
      radiotherapy could be used to prevent the effects of free radicals and thus might protect the&#xD;
      patient's skin from radiation-induced skin reactions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TREATMENT PLAN All patients receive APN201 and placebo at the same time. The irradiated&#xD;
      region is divided vertically into two symmetric areas (left and right). One area is treated&#xD;
      with APN201, the other area is treated with placebo in a double-blind fashion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study treatment (APN201 and placebo) starts on the day of initiation of radiation therapy and&#xD;
      continues until the end of radiation therapy to the whole breast (25 or 28 daily fractions to&#xD;
      a total dose of 50.0 Gy or 50.4 Gy, respectively) (see schedule of assessments, section 5.1).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study treatment is stopped if radiation dermatitis of ≥ grade 2 occurs in one or both treated&#xD;
      areas for ≥ 3 days AND a difference in the severity of radiation dermatitis of ≥ 1 grade is&#xD;
      seen between the two treated areas. From that point in time the patient only receives the&#xD;
      treatment that appeared to be beneficial and this treatment is applied to the whole&#xD;
      irradiated region until completion of the 25th, respectively 28th, fraction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment stops earlier in case of progressive disease or unacceptable toxicity or&#xD;
      intolerability.&#xD;
