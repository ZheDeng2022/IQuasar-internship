&#xD;
          4. Tumor tissue available (according to the criterion of the specimen-processing&#xD;
             laboratory) for EGFR mutation assessment: to be included in the study patients should&#xD;
             present at least one EGFR mutation (exon 19 deletion or L858R with or without T790M).&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Evidence of measurable disease per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors&#xD;

&#xD;
          8. For the Phase II part of the study, patients should not have received previous&#xD;
             treatment with chemotherapy or other agents for advanced disease: chemotherapy is&#xD;
             allowed if the initial diagnosis of the patient is limited disease and the patient has&#xD;
             received adjuvant or neoadjuvant treatment, as long as a minimum of 6 months has&#xD;
             passed since the end of the adjuvant and/or neo-adjuvant chemotherapy. This criterion&#xD;
             is not mandatory to patients to be included in the Phase I part of the study (these&#xD;
             patients are allowed to have received a prior line of treatment for advanced disease).&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Patients with the following hematologic values:&#xD;

&#xD;
         11. Patients of childbearing age of either sex must use effective contraceptive&#xD;
             methods(barrier methods plus other birth control methods) before entering the study&#xD;
             and while participating in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Patients should sign an informed consent form before inclusion in the study that&#xD;
             specifies that the clinical trial treatment entails consent for the analysis of&#xD;
             biological samples of tumor and blood.&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. Patients must be available for clinical follow-up.&#xD;

&#xD;
         17. Patients who present any contraindication or suspected allergy to the products under&#xD;
             investigation in the study. Tablets of gefitinib contain lactose: patients with rare&#xD;
             hereditary problems of galactose intolerance, the Lapp lactose deficiency or glucose&#xD;
             and galactose malabsorption, will not be included in this trial.&#xD;
