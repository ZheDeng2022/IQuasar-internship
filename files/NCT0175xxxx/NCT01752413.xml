      The purpose of this study is to determine (1) the role of ferritin testing to screen for iron&#xD;
      depletion in donors at risk of low iron levels (2) the effectiveness of oral iron replacement&#xD;
      therapy on the repletion of iron stores in donors, and (3) the feasibility of blood centers&#xD;
      to routinely distribute oral iron replacement therapy to donors.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>

      This prospective study will be conducted under IRB approval at Memorial Blood Centers.&#xD;
      Approximately 1000 donors will be enrolled over a two-year period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participant Recruitment Donors presenting to donate whole blood at MBC who have a Hb value&#xD;
      between 12.5-13.5 (males) or 12.0-13.0 (females) will be asked to participate. Written&#xD;
      informed consent will be obtained from each participant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY PROCEDURES MBC will be responsible for donor consenting, specimen collection and&#xD;
      testing, donor deferral, donor-follow-up, and record keeping. Before any study participation,&#xD;
      donors who meet the inclusion criteria will be required to sign and date an informed consent.&#xD;
      All participants will receive a study information sheet and be asked screening questions and&#xD;
      donor information.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An EDTA and red top tube will be taken from the diversion pouch of each participant during&#xD;
      their donation, or obtained from samples already drawn for donor screening. The EDTA sample&#xD;
      and red top tube will be used to determine baseline CBC and ferritin levels, respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Female participants who have a Hb of 12.0-12.4 will not be allowed to donate per FDA&#xD;
      regulations, but will be asked to have an EDTA and red top tube drawn to determine baseline&#xD;
      CBC and ferritin levels, respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants whose ferritin levels are &lt;30 (males) or &lt;20 (females) will be eligible for&#xD;
      enrollment into the low ferritin group. Those with ferritin levels &gt;30 (males) or &gt;20&#xD;
      (females) will be enrolled into the low Hb only group. Females whose Hb was in the range of&#xD;
      12.0-12.4 and with ferritin levels &gt;20 will not be followed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once ferritin levels are determined, participants in both groups will be contacted by a study&#xD;
      nurse. Those in the low Hb only group will be notified of their results and allowed to return&#xD;
      after a standard 56 day deferral. Those in the low ferritin group will be offered iron&#xD;
      replacement therapy and deferred from blood donation for 112 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Oral Iron Replacement Therapy Participants in the low ferritin group will be offered 200&#xD;
      tablets of Ferrous gluconate 325 mg (36 mg elemental iron) sent by mail. Tablets will be in&#xD;
      child proof containers. This amount and form of iron were chosen because of its ready&#xD;
      accessibility over the counter in packs of 100 at low cost to donor/donor center. Also, the&#xD;
      following anemia website suggests 60mg elemental iron daily, i.e. 2-3 iron tablets in divided&#xD;
      doses daily.Participants will be instructed to take one at lunch and one at bedtime.&#xD;
      Participants will be instructed to contact the study physician or study nurse immediately if&#xD;
      any adverse events occur.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Between 25 and 35 days, the study physician or nurse will contact all participants in the low&#xD;
      ferritin group to assess their compliance and tolerance with the iron replacement therapy&#xD;
      using a standard instrument. Those with unacceptable intolerance to the ferrous gluconate may&#xD;
      be offered carbonyl iron at this time, and re-interviewed between days 60 and 70 using the&#xD;
      same instrument.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participant Follow-Up Participants in both groups will be asked to return to donate after&#xD;
      their deferral period. During their follow-up donation, participants will be asked to&#xD;
      complete a follow-up questionnaire, and samples will again be taken to determine CBC and&#xD;
      ferritin levels. Participants will be notified of their results. Statistical analysis will be&#xD;
      performed to determine outcome measures.&#xD;
