      The objective of this study is a comparative evaluation of BuMA stent and of EXCEL stent in&#xD;
      terms of the extent of neointima formation at 3 months after implantation using OCT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a prospective, single center, randomized, open-label, non-inferiority study, which&#xD;
      will enroll a total of 70 patients in Fuwai Hospital.All patients will be randomly assigned&#xD;
      undergoing implantation of BuMA stent or EXCEL stent (in a 1:1 ratio). If non-inferiority was&#xD;
      met, superiority test will be planned.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      About 70 patients with clinical evidence of ischemic heart disease and / or a positive&#xD;
      functional study and documented stable angina pectoris (Canadian cardiovascular society&#xD;
      classification (CCS)1, 2, 3 or 4), or documented silent ischemia in de-novo, native,&#xD;
      previously unstented vessel in Fuwai Hospital,will be randomly assigned undergoing&#xD;
      implantation of BuMA stent or EXCEL stent (in a 1:1 ratio).&#xD;
&#xD;
      All of the patients will receive 6 months dual antiplatelet therapy and they will be followed&#xD;
      (at the outpatient clinic) for up to 2 years. The follow-up visits will be conducted at 3&#xD;
      months (including angiographic/OCT investigation), 6 months, 1 and 2 years post percutaneous&#xD;
      coronary intervention(PCI),in order to observe the Primary Endpoint and Secondary Endpoints.&#xD;
