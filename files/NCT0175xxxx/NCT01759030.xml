      The purpose of this study is to prove that efficacy, safety and immunogenicity of BCD-020 is&#xD;
      equivalent to MabThera when used in combination with methotrexate for the treatment of&#xD;
      patient with rheumatoid arthritis&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an international multicenter double-blind randomized clinical study of the efficacy&#xD;
      and safety (Phase III) with an active comparator; the study provides the additional&#xD;
      evaluation of the interchangeability of rituximab biosimilar and original product MabThera.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will include 308 subjects with active seropositive rheumatoid arthritis who had&#xD;
      intolerance or inadequate response to current therapy regimens including one or more TNF&#xD;
      inhibitors, or who had contraindications to TNF inhibitors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first 24-week stage includes one course of rituximab therapy. The first study stage&#xD;
      proposes central randomization into 2 large groups (1:1): patients from the first group will&#xD;
      recieve BCD-020 (rituximab manufactured by CJSC BIOCAD) at a dose 1000 mg in a drop-wise&#xD;
      manner on day 1 and day 15; patients from the second group will recieve MabThera at a same&#xD;
      regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the final visit of Stage 1 (visit 11 at week 24) all efficacy parameters must be&#xD;
      evaluated. If the disease activity remains (DAS28 score ≥2.6 or increased by 0.6 points or&#xD;
      more compared to the last measurement) the patient will recieve another course of rituximab&#xD;
      treatment. In this case a partial crossover (Stage 2) will take place (by means of the second&#xD;
      randomization): one half of patients with active RA, previously treated with BCD-020, will&#xD;
      receive MabThera at a dose 1000 mg on day 1 and day 15; and one half of patients with active&#xD;
      RA, previously treated with MabThera, will receive BCD-020 at a dose 1000 mg ion day 1 and&#xD;
      day 15. After the first rituximab infusion performed for retreatment, the patient will&#xD;
      undergo 24-week follow-up (counted starting from the date of retreatment initiation). Thus,&#xD;
      effects of the switch from BCD-020 to MabThera and vice versa will be assessed in 24 weeks&#xD;
      after the crossover (Stage 2 of the study).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients in whom remission of RA (DAS28 &lt; 2.6) is reported on week 24 counting from the&#xD;
      initial randomization will undergo the follow up for the next 24 weeks. During this period&#xD;
      they will attend 3 visits (weeks 32, 40 and 48) in order to monitor the disease. If the&#xD;
      exacerbation occurs within the time period not corresponding to week 32 or week 40, the&#xD;
      patient will be invited to the study site for an out-of-schedule visit. If disease&#xD;
      exacerbation is confirmed, he/she undergoes the second randomization, second rituximab&#xD;
      treatment course and further follow up for 6 months (as described above).&#xD;
