  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      When surgery is performed under general anesthesia, a catheter is placed in a vein to&#xD;
      administer drugs and saline. During major operations, an additional catheter is placed in an&#xD;
      artery in order to measure the blood pressure closely and withdraw blood samples at frequent&#xD;
      intervals for various laboratory tests. This arterial catheter is usually placed by feeling&#xD;
      the patient's artery at the wrist and inserting the guide-needle in a blind fashion. This&#xD;
      procedure, at times, leads to delays and failures due to an inability to feel the arterial&#xD;
      pulsation well either due to the patients' anatomy or the anesthetic effect. This study will&#xD;
      determine whether training Anesthesiology Residents in the use of ultrasound technology and&#xD;
      its application in identifying an artery can prevent the problems associated with the&#xD;
      conventional palpation technique. Our finding will lead to better and safer anesthetic&#xD;
      management of patients presenting for a major surgical procedure. Furthermore, the finding&#xD;
      will help us in introducing the education and training of ultrasound-guided arterial catheter&#xD;
      placement in our Residency Program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators propose to follow anesthesia residents over a course of 3 years assessing&#xD;
      their skill level for both palpation and ultrasound technique.&#xD;

      This is an updated study on a previous IRB-approved research (0120070296) which was&#xD;
      terminated prior to conclusion as the principal investigator terminated his employment at the&#xD;
      UNDNJ. An arterial catheter is routinely placed immediately following induction of&#xD;
      anesthesia, in major operative procedures, in order to measure blood pressure continuously,&#xD;
      perform frequent blood-gas analysis and withdraw blood for repeated laboratory testing. The&#xD;
      arterial catheter is traditionally placed blindly by palpating the radial artery of the&#xD;
      patient. This way of placing a radial artery catheter can encounter delay or failure due to&#xD;
      conditions such as obesity, arteriosclerosis, arterial spasm and anesthesia-induced&#xD;
      hypotension. Our study will compare the performance of Anesthesiology Residents in placing an&#xD;
      arterial catheter by the traditional palpation-guided technique and by the ultrasound-guided&#xD;
      technique after training in ultrasound usage. The comparison will utilize the following&#xD;
      parameters:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Time taken to successfully place a catheter&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Number of attempts needed to place a catheter&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Number of puncture site changes encountered&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Failure rate of the resident with each technique&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The need for replacement of the catheter during surgery The data collection will be done&#xD;
           by an independent observer, who is not a member of the anesthesia care team or research&#xD;
           team. The Residents performing the catheter placement will not be members of the&#xD;
           research team and will not have access to the data. If the Resident fails to place the&#xD;
           catheter, the attending anesthesiologist will rescue by placing the arterial catheter&#xD;
           himself by a method of his choice. In the previous study, there was a trend toward a&#xD;
           reduced failure rate and a decreased time for insertion with the ultrasound technique.&#xD;
           In this study, the investigators will introduce the research to the first-year Residents&#xD;
           and repeat the exercise during their second and third year of training in a longitudinal&#xD;
           fashion to assess the progress during anesthesia training. The investigators plan to&#xD;
           enroll eight residents from the first-year class. Each resident will perform eight&#xD;
           arterial catheter placements with each technique. In addition, compared to the previous&#xD;
           study, a more advanced ultrasound machine will be used which will provide better&#xD;
           visualization of the radial artery.&#xD;
