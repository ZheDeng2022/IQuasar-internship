      This clinical trial is designed to provide one kind of modalities for preventing the&#xD;
      recurrence and metastasis of PLC. If the expected therapeutic efficacy is achieved, it shall&#xD;
      contribute actively to boosting the therapeutic level of PLC, prolonging its recurrent time&#xD;
      and enhancing its overall survival. And it may also raise the clinical recognition of this&#xD;
      technology, promote its clinical applications and generate excellent social reputations and&#xD;
      economic returns.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Primary liver cancer (hereinafter abbreviated as PLC) is one of the most common types of&#xD;
      malignant tumors in clinical practices. Its global prevalence is rising year-on-year and&#xD;
      surpasses 626,000 per year. Ranking at No. 5 among all malignant tumors, its mortality rate&#xD;
      approaches 600,000 per year and becomes No.3 of tumor-related death. As one of the prevalent&#xD;
      regions of PLC in the world, China has a morbidity population of around 55%. Among the&#xD;
      tumor-related death, it stands at No. 2 second only to lung cancer. So PLC has been a major&#xD;
      hazard to health and life for Chinese citizens. Surgical resection has remained the first&#xD;
      therapeutic choice of PLC. However, the disease course of PLC is insidious. In clinical&#xD;
      practices, less than 30% of PLC patients may be treated surgically by hepatectomy. And their&#xD;
      postoperative occurrences of recurrence and metastasis stay at a high level. As demonstrated&#xD;
      by large-sample clinical trials in China, the 5-year postoperative recurrent rate of PLC was&#xD;
      as high as 61.5%. The relevant studies have indicated that the surgical therapy of PLC has&#xD;
      encountered a bottle-neck over the last decade and the control rates of postoperative&#xD;
      recurrence or metastasis remain basically the same. Therefore the recurrence and metastasis&#xD;
      of PLC are important limiting factors for its clinical therapeutic gains. Effectively&#xD;
      lowering the post-therapeutic recurrence and metastasis of PLC has become a breakthrough&#xD;
      point for improved clinical efficacies. At present, there is still no standard therapeutic&#xD;
      protocol for the prevention of recurrence and metastasis of PLC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Independently developed recently by China, licartin has been the first radioimmunological&#xD;
      targeted therapeutic agent approved for PLC in the world. Since its marketing in 2007, it has&#xD;
      achieved excellent clinical efficacies and social recognition. As demonstrated by the results&#xD;
      of relevant basic and clinical researches, licartin had definite efficacies for primary&#xD;
      hepatocellular carcinoma and it could boost the efficacies of integrated PLC therapy, prolong&#xD;
      the patient survivals and enhance the benefits of clinical therapeutics. Early studies have&#xD;
      also proved that it could prolong the survivals of PLC, improve the quality of life and&#xD;
      prevent the postoperative recurrence and metastasis. The present clinical trial is intended&#xD;
      to examine the efficacy and safety of radioimmunotherapy via intravenous infusion of licartin&#xD;
      plus sequential immunotherapy of CIK cell in the controls of disease progression, effective&#xD;
      prolonging of recurrent time and prevention of recurrence or metastasis of primary&#xD;
      hepatocellular carcinoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This clinical trial is designed to provide one kind of modalities for preventing the&#xD;
      recurrence and metastasis of PLC. If the expected therapeutic efficacy is achieved, it shall&#xD;
      contribute actively to boosting the therapeutic level of PLC, prolonging its recurrent time&#xD;
      and enhancing its overall survival. And it may also raise the clinical recognition of this&#xD;
      technology, promote its clinical applications and generate excellent social reputations and&#xD;
      economic returns.&#xD;
