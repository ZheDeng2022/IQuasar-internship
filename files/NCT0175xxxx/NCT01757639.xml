      This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of ipilimumab and how well it works&#xD;
      in treating patients with high-risk myelodysplastic syndrome or acute myeloid leukemia that&#xD;
      has come back or no longer responds to treatment. Monoclonal antibodies, such as ipilimumab,&#xD;
      may interfere with the ability of cancer cells to grow and spread.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Evaluate the safety and toxicity associated with the administration of ipilimumab in terms&#xD;
      of dose limiting toxicities (DLT), and maximally-tolerated dose (MTD) in a cohort of patients&#xD;
      with high risk myelodysplastic syndrome who failed hypomethylating therapy, and patients with&#xD;
      acute myeloid leukemia (AML) who underwent induction therapy but are not planned for further&#xD;
      intensive chemotherapy. (Dose-escalation) II. Determine the optimal dose of ipilimumab for&#xD;
      the dose-expansion phase of the trial. (Dose-escalation) III. Better define immunologic&#xD;
      profiles associated with ipilimumab use in terms of regulatory T-cells (T-regs) dynamic&#xD;
      changes in 2 separate cohorts of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and AML patients at the&#xD;
      optimal dose level. (Dose-expansion) IV. Obtain preliminary efficacy data of ipilimumab in&#xD;
      terms of complete response (CR), partial response (PR), and hematological improvement (HI) in&#xD;
      both cohorts. (Dose-expansion)&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Define immunologic profiles associated with ipilimumab use in terms of T-regs dynamic&#xD;
      changes at different dose levels. (Dose-escalation) II. Define toxicity profiles of&#xD;
      ipilimumab at the optimal dose in both patient cohorts. (Dose-expansion) III. Obtain&#xD;
      preliminary data on potential correlations between noted ipilimumab-induced immunologic&#xD;
      changes and observed toxicity and clinical responses. (Dose-expansion)&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      INDUCTION: Patients receive ipilimumab intravenously (IV) on day 1. Treatment repeats every&#xD;
      21 days for up to 4 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MAINTENANCE: Beginning 12 weeks after last dose of induction ipilimumab, patients receive&#xD;
      ipilimumab IV on day 1. Treatment repeats every 12 weeks for up to 4 courses in the absence&#xD;
      of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at least monthly for 6 months.&#xD;

    <description>Changes in T-regs percentages at designated time points will be correlated with clinical responses and toxicity after ipilimumab. The response will be modeled as the vector for each individual from multiple measures of T-regs percentages as a function of time and group (MDS vs AML). T-regs percentages will be transformed onto the log-scale, and t tests will be used to compare groups at specific time points. Regression models that use generalized estimating equations will be implemented when all time points are considered to account for within-subject correlation of repeated measures.</description>
