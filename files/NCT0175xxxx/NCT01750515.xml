      Objective: to study the effect of Acupuncture on liver cirrhosis, SVR and health related&#xD;
      quality of life in HCV patients receiving standard treatment (Peg Interferon+ Ribavirin).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: 60 HCV patients receiving standard treatment (Peg Interferon+ Ribavirin) will&#xD;
      undergo Serologic screening for hepatitis C virus (Anti-HCV EIAs and/or recombinant&#xD;
      immunoblot assay) plus Transient Ultrasound Elastography (FibroScan) to achieve baseline&#xD;
      characteristics(17,18,19). Patients will be randomized into intervention and control groups,&#xD;
      30 patients each.In the Intervention group each patient will receive an acupuncture treatment&#xD;
      once a week for 12 consecutive weeks(Max 12, Min 8 treatments). Treatment protocol will be&#xD;
      individualized for each patient according to TCM diagnosis. This treatment protocol is&#xD;
      acceptable and has been published(20,21,22).In the control group patients will receive&#xD;
      standard treatment alone, with no other intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection: after 12 weeks patients will again undergo Serologic screening for hepatitis&#xD;
      C virus (Anti-HCV EIAs and/or recombinant immunoblot assay) plus Transient Ultrasound&#xD;
      Elastography (FibroScan) in order to detect changes from baseline and group differences.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria: adult patients with a confirmed HCV infection&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Under 18 years Can not receive standard Peg interferon+ ribavirin treatment for any reason&#xD;
      Psychiatric diagnosis Anaemia of hematologic origin Diabetic patient with uncontrolled&#xD;
      diabetes Congestive heart failure, arrhythmia Hepatocellular carcinoma HIV infection&#xD;
      Hepatitis B infection Auto immune liver disease or alcoholic liver disease Study duration: 1&#xD;
      year Study Location: &quot;Ziv&quot; medical center, division of liver disease, Israel&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hepatitis C is an infectious disease affecting primarily the liver, caused by the hepatitis C&#xD;
      virus (HCV). HCV is a worldwide problem, An estimated 130-170 million people worldwide are&#xD;
      infected with HCV, in Israel there are an estimated 80,000 patients. Most patients infected&#xD;
      with HCV have chronic liver disease, which can progress to cirrhosis and Hepatocellular&#xD;
      carcinoma (HCC). Chronic infection with HCV is one of the most important causes of chronic&#xD;
      liver disease and the most common indication for orthotropic liver transplantation (OLT) in&#xD;
      the United States. Medical care costs associated with the treatment of HCV infection in the&#xD;
      United States are estimated to be more than $600 million a year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Chronic hepatitis C infection and chronic active hepatitis are slowly progressive diseases&#xD;
      and result in severe morbidity in 20-30% of infected persons. Although acute HCV infection is&#xD;
      usually mild, chronic hepatitis results in at least 75% of patients. Cirrhosis develops in&#xD;
      20-50% of patients with chronic hepatitis C infection. Liver failure and Hepatocellular&#xD;
      carcinoma can eventually result. Hepatocellular carcinoma occurs in 11-19% of patients . The&#xD;
      diagnosis of acute or chronic HCV infection generally requires testing of serum for both&#xD;
      antibody to HCV (anti-HCV) and for HCV RNA. The recombinant immunoblot assay is used to&#xD;
      confirm HCV infection. A sensitive quantitative HCV RNA assay is recommended for diagnosis&#xD;
      because it also provides information on the level of virus which is helpful in management of&#xD;
      the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Combination therapy with pegylated interferon Alfa (PEG-IFN Alfa) and the nucleoside analogue&#xD;
      ribavirin is the current standard of care in patients infected with HCV. Treatment of chronic&#xD;
      HCV infection has 2 goals. The first is to achieve sustained eradication of HCV (ie,&#xD;
      sustained virologic response [SVR]), which is defined as the persistent absence of HCV RNA in&#xD;
      serum 6 months or more after completing antiviral treatment. The second goal is to prevent&#xD;
      progression to cirrhosis, Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), and decompensated liver disease&#xD;
      requiring liver transplantation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adverse effects are common with IFN and ribavirin combination therapy. Approximately 75% of&#xD;
      patients experience one or more of adverse effects. Common adverse effects are :&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Flulike symptoms&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Hematologic complications (ie, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia)&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Depression&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Low grade fever,&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Nausea, loss of weight&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Neuropsychiatric complications (ie, memory and concentration disturbances, visual&#xD;
           disturbances, headaches, irritability)&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Metabolic complications (gout). Adverse events are a major reason that patients decline&#xD;
           or stop therapy altogether. Currently there are limited options of managing these side&#xD;
           effects, while being especially problematic are the flu like symptoms and depression .&#xD;
           Traditional Chinese medicine(TCM) has been found as an effective treatment for improving&#xD;
           quality of life in various medical conditions including hepatitis. TCM also positively&#xD;
           affects chronic inflammation and improves inflammation markers in chronic inflammatory&#xD;
           diseases such as asthma, crohn's disease, sinusitis and chronic pelvic inflammation .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Acupuncture's effect on liver cirrhosis, SVR(sustained Viral Response) and health related&#xD;
      quality of life in chronic HCV patients has yet to be studied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Aim: to study the effect of acupuncture as an adjunctive treatment for chronic HCV&#xD;
      patients receiving standard treatment (Peg Interferon+ Ribavirin).&#xD;
