  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Each 4-day period will follow the same protocol. Basically, for the entire study, we will&#xD;
      prepare all of the subject's food and will require him or her to eat all of the food that we&#xD;
      give at the times we tell them to eat. The subject will arrive at the hospital on the evening&#xD;
      of day 1, and become inpatients. On day 2, the subject will be permitted to leave the&#xD;
      hospital campus under the supervision of the research staff. On day 3, they will be required&#xD;
      to stay in a small room called a metabolic chamber for 24 hours. This room measures how many&#xD;
      calories you burn in one day. On day 4, we will measure the subject's energy expenditure in&#xD;
      response to a breakfast meal. They will be given breakfast and the number of calories that&#xD;
      they burn after that meal will be measured over a 6-hour period. Then the subject will be&#xD;
      discharged at the end of the test. The 2 study periods will differ only in bedtimes and&#xD;
      wakeup times. During one period, the subject will go to bed at 1 am and wake up at 5 am and&#xD;
      during the other period they will go to bed at 11 pm and wake up at 7 am.&#xD;

      Sleeping metabolic rate will be measured using a metabolic chamber on the night of day 2.&#xD;
      During day 3, 24-hour energy expenditure (including a second night of measurement) will be&#xD;
      measured in the metabolic chamber. On this day, the participant will perform 2 bouts of&#xD;
      physical activity on a stationary bicycle for 15 minutes each bout. This will give us a&#xD;
      measurement of physical activity energy expenditure. On day 4, at 7 am, the participant will&#xD;
      exit the metabolic chamber and will enter a different, smaller metabolic chamber for the&#xD;
      measurement of energy expenditure in response to a meal. This measurement will start at&#xD;
      approximately 8 am with assessment of the resting metabolic rate (45 minutes). The&#xD;
      participant will then be given a high-fat meal replacement to consume over 10 minutes. Energy&#xD;
      expenditure measurements continue in the metabolic chamber for a 6-hour period.&#xD;

    <description>Metabolic rate from 11 pm on day 2 until 7 am on the morning of day 4 will be measured in a metabolic chamber. The metabolic chamber is an air-tight room (22,000 l volume) equipped with a bed, chair, desk, television, VCR, telephone, treadmill, sink and toilet. All meals and snacks will be served at the scheduled time. Subjects will be asked to perform 30 min of light physical activity at 1500 h and 2030 h. Physical activity will consist of 30 min of cycling at 12 mi/h. Bedtimes will be the same as the previous night and actigraph monitoring will be used to confirm compliance with the sleep protocol. Women will exit the chamber at 0700 h the following day.</description>

    <measure>Post Prandial Energy Expenditure and Thermic Effect of Food</measure>
    <time_frame>8 hours on day 4</time_frame>
    <description>Energy expenditure will be measured from 8 am until approximately 2:30 pm on day. Resting metabolic rate over 45 minutes will be measured at 8 am, followed by breakfast and resumption of energy expenditure measurements postprandially.&#xD;
Participants will be given 15 min to consume a high-fat breakfast (50% of energy from fat) and post-prandial thermogenesis and substrate oxidation will be measured for the next 6 h.</description>
