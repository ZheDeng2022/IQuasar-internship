    <description>Avatrombopag maleate 40 mg (2 x 20 mg tablets- all doses are expressed as avatrombopag, the amount of free base) given with 240 mL water in three single oral doses, one during each of three treatment periods. Participants randomized to one of three treatment sequences:&#xD;
Fed, Fed, Fasted; or&#xD;
Fed, Fasted, Fed; or&#xD;
Fasted, Fed, Fed&#xD;
During the Fasted period, participants must have fasted for at least a 10-hour overnight fast and to refrain from eating for 4 hours.&#xD;
During the Fed period, participants were allowed approximately 30 minutes to eat a low-fat breakfast and required to take the drug within 15 minutes of completion of breakfast.&#xD;
Randomization Phase consists of three single-dose treatment periods:&#xD;
Treatment Period 1 and 2 separated by a 7-day washout interval. Treatment Period 2 and 3 separated by a 28-day washout interval. Treatment period 3 and the Follow-up/ Termination Visit will be separated by a 30-day (+1 day) washout interval.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
        Subjects must meet all of the following criteria to be included in this study:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Healthy male and female subjects (aged 18 to 55 years inclusive, at the time of&#xD;
             informed consent)&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Body mass index (BMI) ≥ 18 kg/m2 and ≤ 32 kg/m2 at Screening&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Platelet count between 120 x 109/L and 300 x 109/L inclusive at Screening, Baseline&#xD;
             Period 1, or Baseline Period 3&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Platelet count below the upper limit of normal at Baseline Period 2&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Females must not be lactating or pregnant at Screening or Baseline (as documented by a&#xD;
             negative serum beta-human chorionic gonadotropin [β-hCG] test with a minimum&#xD;
             sensitivity 25 IU/L or equivalent units of β-hCG). A separate baseline assessment is&#xD;
             required if a negative screening pregnancy test was obtained more than 72 hours before&#xD;
             the first dose of study drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. All females will be considered to be of childbearing potential unless they are&#xD;
             postmenopausal (amenorrheic for at least 12 consecutive months, in the appropriate age&#xD;
             group, and without other known or suspected cause) or have been sterilized surgically&#xD;
             (i.e., bilateral tubal ligation, total hysterectomy, or bilateral oophorectomy, all&#xD;
             with surgery at least 1 month before dosing).&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Females of childbearing potential must not have had unprotected sexual intercourse&#xD;
             within 30 days before study entry and must agree to use a highly effective method of&#xD;
             contraception (e.g., total abstinence, a nonhormonal-based intrauterine device, a&#xD;
             double barrier method [such as condom plus spermicide or diaphragm plus spermicide],&#xD;
             non-estrogen-based hormonal therapy, progesterone-only contraceptive&#xD;
             implant/injection, or have a vasectomized partner with confirmed azoospermia)&#xD;
             throughout the entire study period and for 30 days after study drug discontinuation.&#xD;
             If currently abstinent, the subject must agree to use a double barrier method as&#xD;
             described above if she becomes sexually active during the study period or for 30 days&#xD;
             after study drug discontinuation. The use of estrogen-based hormonal contraceptives is&#xD;
             not allowed because of a potential increase in the risk of venous thrombosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
             All females who are of reproductive potential and have been using estrogen-containing&#xD;
             oral contraceptives must have discontinued the contraceptive product for at least 30&#xD;
             days before dosing, throughout the entire study period, and for 30 days after study&#xD;
             drug discontinuation, and have been using use the aforementioned methods.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Male subjects must have had a successful vasectomy (confirmed azoospermia) or they and&#xD;
             their female partners must meet the criteria above (i.e., not of childbearing&#xD;
             potential or practicing highly effective contraception throughout the study period and&#xD;
             for 90 days after study drug discontinuation). No sperm donation is allowed during the&#xD;
             study period and for at least 90 days after the last dose of study drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Provide written informed consent&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Willing and able to comply with all aspects of the protocol&#xD;
