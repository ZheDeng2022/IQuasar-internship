      Specific Aim: This prospective pilot study aims to examine the association of specific&#xD;
      genetic variants (single nucleotide polymorphisms) namely rs2200733, rs6843082, rs10033464,&#xD;
      rs17042171, rs2106261 and rs13376333 on chromosome 1, 4 and 16, with presence of&#xD;
      non-pulmonary vein triggers (NPVT) as well as ablation-outcome in AF patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: Genetic variants predict prevalence of non-PV triggers as well as long-term&#xD;
      procedure-outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background: Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common clinical arrhythmia affecting nearly&#xD;
      3.0 million people in the United States. Its significant contribution to population morbidity&#xD;
      and mortality is amplified by the fact that AF is associated with 3-5 fold increase in the&#xD;
      prevalence of cerebrovascular stroke and 2-fold increase in the risk of death. Limited&#xD;
      efficacy of the available therapeutic strategies makes the matter worse; failures being&#xD;
      attributed to lack of clear-understanding of the pathophysiology of this complex arrhythmia.&#xD;
      In addition to the traditional risk factors including advancing age, obesity, metabolic&#xD;
      syndrome, ischemic/valvular heart disease and hyperthyroidism etc that predict the occurrence&#xD;
      of AF, genetic predisposition to AF has been reported in recent years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Common AF often occurs with structural heart diseases but not all individuals with the same&#xD;
      cardiac pathology develop AF, indicating that there must be genetic factors predisposing some&#xD;
      individuals to AF. In 2007, the first Genome wide association study (GWAS) for AF in subjects&#xD;
      of European descent was reported by investigators from Iceland. Two common variants on&#xD;
      chromosome 4q25 were found that were strongly associated with AF. Following this initial&#xD;
      report, several research groups provided independent replication analyses. So far, there are&#xD;
      at least three distinct genomic loci, 4q25, 16q22, and 1q21 that have a strong association&#xD;
      with AF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although an SNP is generally not sufficient to cause AF, it may act in combination with other&#xD;
      SNPs or pathological conditions (e.g., ischemia and stretch) to increase susceptibility to AF&#xD;
      or it may have some regulatory role in the expression of nearby genes that are potential&#xD;
      candidate genes for AF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recent GWAS findings have left us with promising novel molecular pathways for AF and provide&#xD;
      a starting point for the dissection of these novel pathways related to AF. However, the&#xD;
      majority of these studies have not been replicated in independent populations or in different&#xD;
      ethnic groups and none of the molecular pathways through which these SNPs lead to AF have&#xD;
      been definitively determined. A better understanding and characterization of the genetic&#xD;
      variants associated with AF in general population would facilitate new approaches to the&#xD;
      diagnosis and efficient treatment of this arrhythmia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the other hand, catheter ablation has become an established invasive procedure treating&#xD;
      patients with AF and has offered the promise to free patients of symptoms as well as&#xD;
      eliminate the need for use of chronic drug therapy with agents that sometimes have&#xD;
      significant risks, cost, and inconvenience for the patient. However, despite of the rapid&#xD;
      progress of this technique in the past decade, the success rate and outcome of AF ablation&#xD;
      remain suboptimal and largely variable depending on the case volume and ablation strategy&#xD;
      used at individual centers. Many risk factors have been associated with the procedural&#xD;
      failure and arrhythmia recurrence after AF ablation, including the type of AF, size of left&#xD;
      atrium, cycle length of AF, etc. Recently, we have demonstrated that the presence of NPVT&#xD;
      strongly predicts failure of AF ablation while elimination of NPVTs during the procedure&#xD;
      significantly improves the long term freedom from arrhythmia after ablation of AF of any&#xD;
      type. Non-PV triggers are defined as ectopic triggers originating from sites other than&#xD;
      pulmonary veins such as left atrial posterior wall, superior vena cava, left atrial&#xD;
      appendage, ligament of Marshall and coronary sinus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lately, a few published researches have shown that certain common genetic variants on&#xD;
      different chromosomes are associated not only with an increased risk of AF itself, but also&#xD;
      with the response to AF treatment or prognosis of AF patients. As we have observed a high&#xD;
      incidence of NPVTs in AF patients and their role in determining the AF ablation outcome, we&#xD;
      hypothesize that some common genetic variants at different chromosomal loci are associated&#xD;
      with the occurrence of NPVTs, by which they subsequently predispose the development of AF and&#xD;
      influence its response to management.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This prospective pilot study will enroll 400 consecutive AF patients undergoing catheter&#xD;
      ablation. Baseline blood sample will be collected from all patients for genetic analysis.&#xD;
      Quality of Life (QoL) surveys will be conducted at baseline and 1-year follow-up. All&#xD;
      patients will be followed up for recurrence for one year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be conducted in collaboration with Dr. V. Iyer, professor at University of&#xD;
      Texas at Austin. All genetic analyses will be performed at the UT core facility.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary endpoints:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Association of SNPs with non-PV triggers was considered as primary endpoints.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary endpoints:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Association of SNPs with left atrial scar&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Association of SNPs with non-PV triggers stratified by AF type; paroxysmal (PAF) and&#xD;
           non-paroxysmal AF (NPAF)&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. association of SNPs with arrhythmia recurrence&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Procedure:&#xD;
&#xD;
      1 ml of whole blood will be collected from each patient in a 4 ml Sodium-heparin tube before&#xD;
      the ablation procedure. The blood sample will be labeled with an anonymous patient identifier&#xD;
      that can only be identified by research staff. Following collection, blood sample will be&#xD;
      stored at -200 C at the clinical lab of St. David's Medical Center until it is transferred&#xD;
      (twice weekly in nitrogen bucket) to the lab of Dr. V. Iyer (Molecular Genetics and&#xD;
      Microbiology, UT at Austin) where it will be stored at -70 degree C freezer until the end of&#xD;
      the study, when all samples will be simultaneously analyzed. Genomic DNA purification and SNP&#xD;
      analysis by Taqman assay will be performed for all samples at the end of the study, at the UT&#xD;
      facility.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DNA purification protocol:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Qiagen QiaAMP 96 well blood kit will be used to lyse the white blood cells and purify genomic&#xD;
      DNA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Overview of the procedure for using TaqMan SNP Genotyping Assays:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Purified DNA samples will be used in a TaqMan qPCR assay. Briefly, a small quantity of each&#xD;
      sample of DNA will be added to six wells in a 384 well qPCR plate. Next, Taqman fluorescent&#xD;
      labeled probe will be added to the wells. Lastly, TaqMan master mix will be put in each well.&#xD;
      This qPCR plate will be run on a Life Technologies ViiA7 real-time qPCR machine. To detect&#xD;
      the presence or absence of each SNP in each patient, a plate reader will be used to detect&#xD;
      fluorescence in each well.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ablation procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Standard mapping and ablation procedures will be performed at the discretion of the&#xD;
      physician.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following ablation, patients will be discharged on their previously ineffective AADs which&#xD;
      will be continued for 90 days (blanking period). The blanking period allows time for the&#xD;
      inflammatory process to subside. AADs will be discontinued after the blanking period for all&#xD;
      patients. If a patient suffers a recurrence of an atrial arrhythmia, AAD therapy may be&#xD;
      administered at the discretion of the physician.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will be followed-up for minimum of 1 year following the PVAI. Recurrence will be&#xD;
      assessed by event recording for 5 months and Holter monitoring at 1, 3, 6 and 12 months.&#xD;
      Recurrence will be defined as freedom from atrial flutter (AFL), AF or atrial tachycardia&#xD;
      (AT) of &gt; 30 seconds duration, in the absence of anti-arrhythmic drugs (AADs) at follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Risk Analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study does not pose any additional risk to the patient. The risks are the same as those&#xD;
      for a standard AF ablation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Minor risks associated with a venous blood draw may include fainting or bruising, pain or&#xD;
      discomfort and a 1/1000 risk of infection at the site where blood is drawn.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Benefits:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The subject may not incur any benefit by participating in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Potential benefit for future patients: This information will enrich the knowledge about the&#xD;
      molecular mechanism of AF and help in developing personalized ablation strategies for future&#xD;
      patients that would be more effective in eliminating this arrhythmia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Methodology:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sampling Plan:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Consecutive eligible patients will be approached for enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis Plan:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Continuous variables will be reported as mean ± standard deviation (SD). The categorical&#xD;
      variables will be reported as frequencies and percentage. Data analysis will be performed&#xD;
      using the unpaired Student's t-test for continuous variables and chi-square test for&#xD;
      categorical variables.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For genotype-rhythm outcome correlations, 3 different models will be applied. The variant&#xD;
      alleles will be assumed to be either dominant or recessive or having additive effects in&#xD;
      these models. In the dominant model, an identical effect is expected in heterozygous and&#xD;
      homozygous variant carriers. In the recessive model, an effect is only seen in homozygous&#xD;
      variant carriers. Lastly, in the additive model, heterozygous variant carriers are assumed to&#xD;
      have an intermediate effect as compared to the homozygotes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Multivariate regression analysis will be performed using Cox proportional hazards model to&#xD;
      test the association of the SNPs with the prevalence of non-PV triggers and outcome variable.&#xD;
      SAS 9.2 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC) will be used for statistical analysis&#xD;
