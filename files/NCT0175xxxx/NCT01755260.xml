      Postoperative pancreatic fistula (POPF) is the most detrimental complication of pancreatic&#xD;
      surgery due to the potential life-threatening consequences of fluid and electrolyte&#xD;
      imbalance, nutritional depletion, sepsis, and local complications, such as abdominal abscess&#xD;
      and hemorrhage.1 Incidence rates vary considerably from 0 to 24% due to the differences in&#xD;
      definitions with an overall rate of 12.9% in a recent series.1,2 Several risk factors have&#xD;
      been identified, mostly a soft parenchyma and a small main pancreatic duct diameter; however,&#xD;
      numerous attempts to reduce fistula rates with either pharmacological prophylaxis or&#xD;
      application of some special surgical techniques failed to improve postoperative outcomes. The&#xD;
      primary therapy for POPF today includes adequate drainage of pancreatic exocrine secretions&#xD;
      and conservative treatment, consisting of nutritional support and correction of electrolyte&#xD;
      disturbances and fistula-related complications. 3-5 These recommendations are based on&#xD;
      previous observations suggesting that up to 70% of cases eventually resolve&#xD;
      spontaneously.3,5,6 However, the patient's discomfort, the need for follow-up visits and the&#xD;
      substantial costs of prolonged therapy initiated various attempts to accelerate closure&#xD;
      rates. Several measures have been proposed, including fibrin glues, endoscopic interventions,&#xD;
      or the use of somatostatin analogues to inhibit pancreatic exocrine secretion. Nevertheless,&#xD;
      these methods lack any convincing evidence that the proposed regimens may be clinically&#xD;
      effective.4,7,8 Nutritional support is the key element of conservative therapy in patients&#xD;
      with POPF, as most of them are in a catabolic state and attempts to accelerate fistula&#xD;
      closure usually involve prolonged fasting. However, the decision between total parenteral&#xD;
      nutrition (TPN) and enteral nutrition is essentially arbitrary because the effects of both&#xD;
      diets on closure rates of postoperative pancreatic fistula have not been compared in a&#xD;
      randomized clinical trial.3,9 Experiments with healthy individuals have demonstrated that&#xD;
      intravenous feeding does not stimulate pancreatic secretion, and thus is a reasonable&#xD;
      solution when prolonged nutritional support is needed without increasing the exocrine&#xD;
      pancreatic function.10 However, previous research has suggested that long-term TPN leads to&#xD;
      negative functional and morphological changes, not only within the gastrointestinal mucosa&#xD;
      but also atrophy and dysfunction of the exocrine pancreas.11 Therefore, enteral feeding&#xD;
      beyond the ligament of Treitz is commonly preferred over the intravenous route due to lower&#xD;
      costs and the potential advantage of avoiding infectious and metabolic complications related&#xD;
      to the parenteral route. This hypothesis was substantiated in several clinical trials&#xD;
      demonstrating that enteral nutrition via a nasojejunal tube can be safely used in patients&#xD;
      with various disorders, including acute pancreatitis and postoperative pancreatic fistula.&#xD;
      12-15Some of these reports suggested that the enteral route offers major advantages over TPN&#xD;
      in terms of faster recovery and lower rates of disease- and nutrition-related&#xD;
      complications.16 However, data concerning chronic pancreatic conditions are limited.17 It is&#xD;
      well established that the duodenum is the major site of pancreatic secretion stimulation.&#xD;
      Cholecystokinin (CCK) and secretin released in the duodenum and enteropancreatic reflexes&#xD;
      mediated by vago-vagal cholinergic pathways are responsible for the majority of pancreatic&#xD;
      exocrine secretion.18Without raising CCK levels, the enteropancreatic reflex can be activated&#xD;
      with a corresponding increase in pancreatic enzyme secretion, by distention or administration&#xD;
      of hyperosmolar solutions in the duodenum. Pancreatic polypeptide (PP) secretion is also&#xD;
      under cholinergic control and thus may be a modulator of pancreatic secretion stimulated by&#xD;
      the vagal cholinergic pathway.19 It has also been shown that intraileal or colonic perfusion&#xD;
      of nutrients decreases pancreatic exocrine secretion, possibly mediated through the&#xD;
      ileal-brake gut peptides, namely peptide YY (PYY) and glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1). 20-22&#xD;
      Enteral feeding via a nasojejunal feeding tube necessitates endoscopic placement which could&#xD;
      be dangerous in immediately operated patients with gastrojejunostomy and might cause&#xD;
      tube-related discomfort to patients. Anatomically, pancreaticoduodenectomy will include&#xD;
      removal of duodenum and proximal 10 ~ 15 cm jejunum (Figure 1). In addition, another 30~40&#xD;
      cm-long jejunum will be brought up for pancreatic and biliary anastomosis (figure 2).&#xD;
      Therefore, the last enteral anastomosis (gastrojejunostomy or duodenojejunostomy) will be&#xD;
      made at site of 40~50 cm distal to Treitz ligament which is far more distal than site of&#xD;
      nasojejunal tube used in patients with acute pancreatitis. Therefore, we hypothesize that&#xD;
      oral feeding in patients operated with PD will not stimulate but inhibit pancreatic secretion&#xD;
      and hasten closure of pancreatic fistula. To test this hypothesis, we propose a prospective&#xD;
      randomized trial to test the effect of various nutrition methods on healing of PF after PD.&#xD;
      Patients will be randomized into 2 groups (A and B). Eligible patients will be randomized in&#xD;
      a 1:1 ratio to receive oral feeding nutrition, or TPN as a standard therapy of POPF. The&#xD;
      primary end points will be closure rate of PF. Secondary end points will include length and&#xD;
      cost of hospital stay after operation.&#xD;

      the proposed regimens may be clinically effective.&#xD;
