      The goal of this clinical research study is to learn if treatment with standard systemic&#xD;
      therapy (androgen deprivation therapy or bilateral orchiectomy) in combination with surgery&#xD;
      or radiation therapy is more effective at controlling prostate cancer than standard systemic&#xD;
      therapy alone. The safety of this treatment combination will also be studied.&#xD;

      Study Groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will be randomly assigned (as&#xD;
      in the flip of a coin) to 1 of 2 study groups at 6 months (+/- 14 days) from starting&#xD;
      standard systemic therapy. You will have an equal chance of being assigned to each group.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If you are in Group 1, you will continue to receive standard of care systemic treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If you are in Group 2, you will receive standard of care systemic treatment in addition&#xD;
           to surgery to remove your prostate or radiation therapy to the prostate. You and your&#xD;
           treating physician will decide if surgery or radiation therapy is the best choice for&#xD;
           you. Your treating physician will explain the surgery or radiation therapy and their&#xD;
           risks to you in more detail, and you will be asked to sign a separate consent form for&#xD;
           the procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the disease gets worse within the first 6 months of receiving standard systemic therapy,&#xD;
      you will not be assigned to a study group. You may be able to continue receiving standard&#xD;
      systemic therapy if your doctor thinks it is in your best interest. You may choose to&#xD;
      participate in this study by allowing the study team to collect information about you at the&#xD;
      following study visits described below: within 60 days of screening, end-of-treatment, and&#xD;
      long-term followup.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Visits:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Within 60 days after screening:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a physical exam, including a digital rectal exam (DRE).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will be asked how well you are able to perform the normal activities of daily living&#xD;
           (performance status).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 2-3 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests, to check your&#xD;
           prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels, and testosterone levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Urine will be collected for routine tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will complete a questionnaire about how you are feeling. It should take about 15&#xD;
           minutes to complete.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a bone scan, 2 CT scans of your abdomen and pelvis, and a chest X-ray or a&#xD;
           computed tomography (CT) scan of chest to check the status of the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a endorectal Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scan of the prostate to&#xD;
           check the status of the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Every 12 weeks (+/- 14 days) while on study (starting at month 9):&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a physical exam, including a DRE and any updates to your medical history&#xD;
           will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will be asked about any side effects you may have had.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will be asked about any drugs or treatments you may be receiving, including&#xD;
           over-the-counter drugs, herbal remedies, vitamins, and/or supplements.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 2-3 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests, to check your liver&#xD;
           function, and to measure PSA and testosterone levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will complete a questionnaire about how you are feeling. It should take about 15&#xD;
           minutes to complete.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If the study doctor thinks it is needed, you will have CT/MRI imaging scans to check the&#xD;
           status of the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are not having side effects after the 12-month visit, you will be given a PSA kit so&#xD;
      you can send in a sample to test your PSA level. You will need to have your blood (about 1&#xD;
      teaspoon) drawn at your local doctor's office or lab and mail the kit in, every 3 months. The&#xD;
      package will be provided, but you will need to pay postage. You would still need to visit the&#xD;
      clinic every 6 months. The study staff will tell you more about this.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Length of Treatment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      You may continue your participation in this study for as long as the doctor thinks it is in&#xD;
      your best interest. You will be taken off the study treatment if the disease gets worse, if&#xD;
      intolerable side effects occur, or if you are unable to follow study directions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Your active participation on the study will be over after the long-term follow-up phone&#xD;
      calls/emails (described below).&#xD;
&#xD;
      End-of-Treatment Visit:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Within 14 days after your study treatment is stopped, the following tests and procedures will&#xD;
      be performed:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a physical exam, including a DRE.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will be asked about any side effects you may have had.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will be asked about any drugs or treatments you may be receiving, including&#xD;
           over-the-counter drugs, herbal remedies, vitamins, and/or supplements.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 2-3 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests, to check your liver&#xD;
           function, and to measure PSA and testosterone levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Urine will be collected for biomarker testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will complete a questionnaire about how you are feeling. It should take about 15&#xD;
           minutes to complete.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If the study doctor thinks it is needed, you will have CT/MRI imaging scans to check the&#xD;
           status of the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Long-Term Follow-Up:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Every 6 months after your end-of-treatment visit for up to 10 years, you will be contacted by&#xD;
      phone or e-mail, and you will be asked questions about how you are feeling. Each phone call&#xD;
      should last about 5 minutes. If you are not able to be contacted by phone or email, the study&#xD;
      doctor will review and record any updates to your medical record.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an investigational study. Using standard of care systemic treatment with surgery,&#xD;
      and/or radiation therapy are both FDA approved and commercially available.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 180 patients will take part in this multi-center study. Up to 180 patients will be&#xD;
      enrolled at MD Anderson.&#xD;
