      Primary objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To establish the maximum tolerated dose (MTD), and the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D)&#xD;
           of BEZ235 when administered twice daily (BID) as a single agent in patients with&#xD;
           relapsed or refractory acute leukemia&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the dose-limiting toxicity (DLT)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Assess the safety and tolerability of daily oral administration of BEZ235 with a BID&#xD;
           schedule&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To describe preliminary anti-leukemic activity of BEZ235 in patients with acute leukemia&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To correlate changes in pharmacodynamic biomarkers with basic pharmacokinetic data&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exploratory objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess pre-treatment phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) pathway-related genes in&#xD;
           blast cells and all other malignant cells derived from blood or bone marrow.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the pharmacodynamic changes in components of the PI3K-protein kinase B&#xD;
           (AKT)-mTOR pathway in bone marrow following treatment as potential predictive biomarkers&#xD;
           of pharmacodynamic (PD) activity of BEZ235 in association with clinical responses.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To identify potential resistance mechanisms and biomarkers that may correlate with&#xD;
           efficacy and response from blood and bone marrow samples pre-and post-treatment in case&#xD;
           of resistance&#xD;
