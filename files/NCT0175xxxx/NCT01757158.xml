  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary curative treatment of lung cancer patients is surgery, chemotherapy and/or&#xD;
      radiation therapy (either or all depending on the extent of disease). Surgical resection&#xD;
      usually requires removal of a lobe of the lung (lobectomy). There are, however, some patients&#xD;
      who are unable to have a lobectomy. There are several reasons why a patient should not have a&#xD;
      lobectomy including prior operations in the same area of the lung or poor lung functions.&#xD;
      Sub-lobe operations (less than a full lobectomy), are alternatives for these patients. Types&#xD;
      of sub-lobe operations include wedge resection or segmentectomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, a randomized trial in early stage lung cancer patients that compared lobectomy&#xD;
      versus wedge resection showed worse local control of cancer with wedge resection. Therefore,&#xD;
      localized disease wedge resection is considered an inadequate operation. This inadequacy can&#xD;
      be compensated if radiation seeds are added to the site of wedge resection. Iodine-125&#xD;
      (I-125) is the most commonly used radiation seed for this purpose. I-125, however,&#xD;
      unfortunately has a relatively long half life (time taken for activity to become half) of 2&#xD;
      months. Therefore, the patient is technically 'radioactive' for an average of 6 months to 1&#xD;
      year. This can seriously compromise quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cesium-131 is another radiation seed that may more effectively treat lung cancer patients.&#xD;
      Cs-131 has been previously used in prostate cancer successfully. Cs-131 has similar energy to&#xD;
      I-125 but has a much shorter half life (9days as compared to 60 days for I-125). Patients who&#xD;
      receive Cs-131 radiation seeds are expected to be radioactive for 30 days (1 month) as&#xD;
      compared to 180 days (6 months) with I-125. The objective of this study is the use Cs-131&#xD;
      radiation seeds in lung cancer patients who are planning to undergo a wedge resection for&#xD;
      localized disease and follow the patients for cancer control and toxicity. These results will&#xD;
      be compared to pre-existing data for I-125 treatment outcomes in lung cancer patients who&#xD;
      have had a wedge resection for localized disease.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A lobectomy (removal of a full lobe of the lung or removal of Â¼ - 1/5 of the entire lungs) is&#xD;
      a part of the primary curative treatment for people with lung cancer. There are, however,&#xD;
      some patients who are unable to have a lobectomy. There are several reasons why a patient&#xD;
      should not have a lobectomy including prior operations in the same area of the lung or poor&#xD;
      lung functions. Sub-lobe operations (less than a full lobectomy), are alternatives for these&#xD;
      patients. Types of sub-lobe operations include wedge resection or segmentectomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, a randomized trial in early stage lung cancer patients that compared lobectomy&#xD;
      versus wedge resection showed that cancer was not controlled as well in individuals who had&#xD;
      the wedge resection. Localized disease wedge resection alone is therefore considered an&#xD;
      inadequate operation. This inadequacy, however, can be compensated for if radiation seeds are&#xD;
      implanted (added) to the site of wedge resection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Iodine-125 radiation seeds are currently the most common radioactive material implanted in&#xD;
      the operative bed after wedge resection. However, I-125 has a half-life of 60 days. This&#xD;
      causes the patient to be &quot;radioactive&quot; for 6 months to 1 year. When an individual is&#xD;
      radioactive they must take necessary precautions that result in a significantly compromised&#xD;
      quality of life. These precautions are 1) no continuous close contact (less than 3 feet) for&#xD;
      a significant duration of time (more than 15 minutes), 2) no close contact with pregnant&#xD;
      women and children, 3) adequate precautions especially during air travel and 4) risk of&#xD;
      radioactive seed displacement several months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The local control of cancer with this treatment is &gt;95%_ %. Cesium-131 is a novel radiation&#xD;
      seed that has the same energy as I-125 but has a much shorter half life (9days). That means&#xD;
      that Cs-131 seeds give off all their radiation at a faster rate. When a radioactive seeds&#xD;
      gives off all of its radiation it is no longer radioactive and the dangers of radioactivity&#xD;
      no longer exist. With a half life of 9 days, Cs-131 gives off all of its radiation in 1&#xD;
      month. This significantly reduces the time when the patient is 'radioactive'. Therefore,&#xD;
      Cs-131 has less of a negative affect on quality of life than I-125.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, because of Cs-131's significantly faster rate of radiation dissemination, faster&#xD;
      growing cancers (especially lung cancer) cells should be killed more efficiently thereby&#xD;
      increasing cancer control rates. In addition, the lesser total radiation time may result in&#xD;
      reduced short term and long term side effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cs-131 is FDA approved and has been used mostly for prostate cancer. Our experience with&#xD;
      Cs-131 in prostate cancer has shown it to be a very well tolerated treatment with excellent&#xD;
      cure rates.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary study endpoint is to assess local control of localized lung cancers after limited&#xD;
      resection (wedge resection or segmentectomy) and Cs-131 seed placement in comparison to&#xD;
      previously assessed local control of localized lung cancers after limited resection and I-125&#xD;
      seed placement. The primary objective is to assess local control after a wedge resection and&#xD;
      Cs-131 implant. The secondary objective is to assess quality of life (as related to side&#xD;
      effects) of Cs-131 seed placement after limited surgical resection in lung cancers and&#xD;
      compare it to already existing data on I-125 tolerability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedures that are part of regular cancer care and may be done whether a patient enrolls in&#xD;
      the research study or not include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. CT scans of patient chest&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Medistinoscopy (only if the surgeon is suspicious that there is cancer in the patient's&#xD;
           lymph nodes),&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  If the cancer has spread to the lymph nodes, patients will no longer be eligible&#xD;
                for the study as the classification of their disease would no longer be NSCLC.&#xD;
                Patients would alternately receive appropriate, and standard treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
      Standard procedures being done only because the patient is part of the study;&#xD;
&#xD;
      1) Quality of life questionnaires&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up Patients will be monitored for local recurrence, regional recurrence and distant&#xD;
      recurrence and progression for three years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Local recurrence: recurrence within the same lobe or hilum (N1 nodes), or at the staple line&#xD;
      after treatment effects such as scarring have subsided.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Regional recurrence: recurrence within another lobe or pleura on the same side as the&#xD;
      resection, or the ipsilateral mediastinal (N2) nodes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Distant recurrence: recurrence within contralateral lobe, contralateral mediastinal (N3)&#xD;
      nodes or distant metastatic disease (other organs).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients also will be monitored for additional primaries and regional recurrence, with&#xD;
      histological confirmation whenever possible. Autopsy reports will be obtained whenever&#xD;
      possible. A copy of the death certificate will also be obtained.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Protocol follow-up will be performed at 3, 6, 12, 18, 24, and 36 months and yearly to 5&#xD;
      years. The yearly follow-up visits for Years 4 and 5 will consist of either a phone call or&#xD;
      clinical visit (at investigator's discretion) for vital status only. These follow-up visits&#xD;
      will occur + 60 days from the yearly anniversary date of the resection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A CT scan will be performed pre-operatively and at 3, 6, 12, 18, 24, 30 and 36 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      QoL using the SF36 and UCSD Shortness of Breath Questionnaire will be obtained&#xD;
      pre-operatively and at 3, 12 and 24 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post-operative adjuvant chemotherapy may be given at the discretion of the treating&#xD;
      physician. Postoperative adjuvant radiation therapy will never be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evaluation of Outcomes&#xD;
&#xD;
      Local Recurrence (primary endpoint)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Local recurrence is indicated when a follow-up examination shows growth of primary tumor or&#xD;
      abnormality in the resected lobe on CT scan. Since scarring may occur adjacent to the&#xD;
      brachytherapy site, a CT scan will be obtained at 3 months. This will form the baseline study&#xD;
      that local recurrence will be judged against. Increased parenchymal opacification (by 25% or&#xD;
      more) adjacent to the staple line/mesh line will be considered suspicious for local&#xD;
      recurrence. The repeated CT scans should allow any significant changes to be observed even if&#xD;
      there is a slight image artifact from the metal seeds which may interfere with interpretation&#xD;
      of the CT scan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Any suspicious areas will be confirmed by a needle biopsy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Scans for Disease Relapse Unconfirmed by Biopsy If biopsy of suspicious areas is not&#xD;
      feasible, then a PET scan is required. Copies of the PET scan, the 3- month (baseline) CT&#xD;
      scan and the most current CT scan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Quality of Life As a secondary outcome, patient-centered quality of life (QoL) data will be&#xD;
      measured using the SF36 and dyspnea will be measured using the UCSD Shortness of Breath&#xD;
      Questionnaire. [Eakin, 1998] These are ill patients with significant pulmonary morbidity. It&#xD;
      will be important to quantify any changes in overall health and pulmonary-specific symptoms&#xD;
      in this population. Each patient will act as his or her own control. These validated&#xD;
      instruments have been used in many trials of patients with severe lung disease. Measurements&#xD;
      will be undertaken before and at 3, 12 and 24 months after surgery.&#xD;
