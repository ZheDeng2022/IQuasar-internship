    <textblock>
      The long-term goal is to determine if decreased blood flow to the brain (cerebral&#xD;
      hypoperfusion) is predictive of antidepressant outcomes in late-life depression (LLD).&#xD;
      Studies in younger adult report that successful antidepressant treatment is associated with&#xD;
      increases in cerebral blood flow, with no change in blood flow being observed in&#xD;
      nonresponders. Thus cerebral hypoperfusion may be a biomarker of poor response to&#xD;
      antidepressants. In LLD, this may occur secondarily to underlying vascular disease. If LLD is&#xD;
      characterized by cerebral hypoperfusion and it does have predictive power to identify&#xD;
      individuals who will poorly respond to conventional antidepressants, this would support the&#xD;
      study of interventions that improve cerebral perfusion and may improve antidepressant&#xD;
      outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As an initial step in this research, this pilot study will utilize MRI to examine if resting&#xD;
      blood flow deficits predict and persist with antidepressant nonremission in an elderly&#xD;
      population. The rationale for this proposal is that it will guide the design and power&#xD;
      requirements of a larger, definitive trial examining the relationship between cerebral&#xD;
      perfusion and depression outcomes. Importantly, support for this mechanism being linked to&#xD;
      LLD would also support studies examining the antidepressant efficacy of drugs that may&#xD;
      improve cerebral perfusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary purpose of this pilot study is a) to demonstrate feasibility by recruiting,&#xD;
      scanning, and treating depressed elders; and b) to acquire preliminary data for competitive&#xD;
      grant submissions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SPECIFIC AIM: To use MRI to test for differences in cerebral perfusion between individuals&#xD;
      who do and do not remit to a 8-week course of sertraline.&#xD;

      After providing informed consent, participants will complete brain MRI and memory testing. If&#xD;
      they are currently taking an antidepressant and are not doing well on it, they will be taken&#xD;
      off it. Participants will then start sertraline, a commercially available antidepressants.&#xD;
      They will be monitored for response and side effects for 8 weeks and doses adjusted as&#xD;
      needed. After the study, we will examine how differences in brain blood flow may predict who&#xD;
      does and does not respond to sertraline.&#xD;
