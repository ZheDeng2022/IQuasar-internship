      1. ERCP is a commonly performed endoscopic procedure used to treat stones and blockages of&#xD;
           the bile duct as well as to manage leaks which occurs following laparoscopic gallbladder&#xD;
           removal.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Post ERCP pancreatitis (PEP) complicates 5-15% of biliary endoscopic procedures and&#xD;
           results in considerable suffering and cost.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Patients with acute pancreatitis are treated with fluids.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Our aim is to assess whether prophylactic treatment with aggressive intravenous&#xD;
           hydration prevents ERCP pancreatitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. In a blinded fashion patients will be randomized to aggressive intravenous versus&#xD;
           moderate hydration during and aftere ERCP for standard clinical indications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our hypothesis is that prophylactic treatment with aggressive intravenous hydration protects&#xD;
      against ERCP pancreatitis.&#xD;

      1.0 BACKGROUND AND HYPOTHESES&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) pancreatitis is defined as the&#xD;
      development of epigastric pain radiating to the back accompanied by either an increase in the&#xD;
      pancreatic enzymes (amylase and lipase) to greater than three times the upper limit of normal&#xD;
      or cross sectional imaging showing inflammation of the gland. Based on length of&#xD;
      hospitalization it is categorized as mild (2-3 days), moderate (4-10 days), or severe (&gt;10&#xD;
      days). Cases complicated by hemorrhage, pseudocyst, phlegmon formation or requiring&#xD;
      percutaneous intervention or surgery are also scored as severe.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post ERCP pancreatitis is the leading complication of biliary endoscopic procedures and could&#xD;
      potentially lead to considerable morbidity. The overall incidence of ERCP pancreatitis ranges&#xD;
      from 5% in the community to 15% in centers where advanced ERCP including pancreatic&#xD;
      interventions are performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Proposed mechanisms include protease and free radical mediated inflammation, abnormal&#xD;
      sphincter of oddi pressure, and elevated pancreatic exocrine activity. Measures to prevent&#xD;
      post-ERCP pancreatitis aim to curb these processes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Numerous trials studying the use of various preventive therapies including octreotide and&#xD;
      protease inhibitors have been for the most part disappointing. There have been more than&#xD;
      twenty clinical trials examining the efficacy of somatostatin and octreotide which inhibit&#xD;
      pancreatic exocrine stimulation. A meta-analysis of nine high quality trials of somatostatin&#xD;
      showed that overall the medication did not reduce post ERCP pancreatitis. Gabexylate mesylate&#xD;
      and ulnistatin which inhibit pancreatic proteases have also shown to not significantly reduce&#xD;
      post ERCP pancreatitis. Numerous studies have also shown that corticosteroids do not diminish&#xD;
      the likelihood of post-ERCP pancreatitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The mainstay of treatment for acute pancreatitis independent of origin is aggressive&#xD;
      hydration. The rationale for this is that hypovolemia and microvascular hypoperfusion are&#xD;
      critical to the development of pancreatic necrosis. In animal models it has been demonstrated&#xD;
      that pancreatic blood flow decreases in the setting of pancreatitis. Regions of hypoperfusion&#xD;
      correlate with regions of severe histologic inflammation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Studies of fluid resuscitation in patients with interstitial pancreatitis have demonstrated&#xD;
      that those treated with inadequate fluid resuscitation have an increased risk of developing&#xD;
      pancreatic necrosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several high profile studies have demonstrated that aggressive early fluid resuscitation on&#xD;
      the order of 3.4-4.6 liters in the first 24 hours, particularly using lactated ringers is&#xD;
      associated with significantly reduced mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a well done retrospective study Reddy et al demonstrated that patients at high risk for&#xD;
      post ERCP pancreatitis (and those with early signs) managed with an aggressive fluid&#xD;
      resuscitation protocol (defined as D5 ½ NS at 200cc/hour IV) had a significantly improved&#xD;
      clinical course compared to those who were not managed according to the protocol.12 Among&#xD;
      those high risk patients who were managed according to protocol only 12.5% developed moderate&#xD;
      or severe pancreatitis, compared to 61.6% who were not managed according to the protocol. The&#xD;
      respective median lengths of hospitalization were 3 days compared to 7 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the proposed study our intervention is to prophylactically treat a random group of&#xD;
      patients undergoing ERCP with the standard therapy for post ERCP pancreatitis, fluids, in an&#xD;
      effort to prevent its development. As a safeguard at 2 hours after the procedure (when the&#xD;
      anesthesia from the procedure has typically cleared) any patient who has evidence of&#xD;
      pancreatitis is crossed over into the treatment arm. The major potential adverse outcome&#xD;
      which could be associated with the therapy is clinical fluid overload as manifested as chest&#xD;
      pain, dyspnea or hypoxia as well as pleural effusion, peripheral edema, ascites, anasarca, or&#xD;
      pulmonary edema. We will assess the patients for these potential complications and treat them&#xD;
      accordingly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goal for this pilot study is to analyze the efficacy of aggressive hydration in&#xD;
      preventing post ERCP pancreatitis. Our hope is to stimulate interest in this topic and&#xD;
      clarify if it could possibly lead to a large-scale study in the near future.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.0 OBJECTIVES AND PURPOSE The primary treatment for pancreatitis regardless of the etiology&#xD;
      is aggressive fluid resuscitation. Our long-standing aim is to determine whether aggressive&#xD;
      intravenous hydration during and immediately after ERCP decreases the incidence of post ERCP&#xD;
      pancreatitis. The aim of the current study is to determine how large the effect will be to&#xD;
      appropriately power a larger randomized trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.0 STUDY DESIGN&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be a prospective single blind randomized controlled trial consisting of 60&#xD;
      patients who will undergo ERCP at the LAC+USC Medical Center for standard indications.&#xD;
      Patients will be randomly assigned using a computer generated randomization schedule, 40 will&#xD;
      be allocated to the treatment (aggressive intravenous hydration) and 20 will be allocated to&#xD;
      standard care. This will allow us to examine whether the rate of pancreatitis under usual&#xD;
      care is similar to published rates (about 15%), and also allow us greater ability to detect&#xD;
      decreases in that rate attributable to the treatment in our small pilot sample. We defined&#xD;
      aggressive intravenous hydration as lactated ringers (LR) IV at 3 mL kg-1 hr-1 during the&#xD;
      procedure, with 20cc/kg LR IV bolus immediately afterward, and LR IV at 3 mL kg-1 hr-1 x 8&#xD;
      hours. Those in the control arm will receive standard fluids which we define as LR at 1.5 mL&#xD;
      kg-1 hr-1 and for 8 hours afterwards&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once the patients begin receiving the fluids, volume status will be monitored to assess for&#xD;
      any signs of fluid overload or deficits that will require an adjustment to the fluid&#xD;
      resuscitation rates. Imbalances in volume status will be monitored clinically by assessing&#xD;
      for tachycardia, orthostatic hypotension based on blood pressure measurements, pulmonary and&#xD;
      peripheral edema. Based on the hydration status, adjustments will be made accordingly to the&#xD;
      fluid resuscitation rates to correct the underlying problem.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Numerous studies have attempted to investigate the best test available to assess for&#xD;
      post-ERCP pancreatitis, since solely relying on clinical presentation is unreliable. Amylase&#xD;
      levels have emerged as a reliable indicator of post-ERCP pancreatitis as lipase usually rises&#xD;
      later in pancreatitis and as a result may not be as useful in the early prediction of&#xD;
      post-ERCP pancreatitis.13 In our study, the patients will be assessed at 2 hours and 8 hours&#xD;
      after the procedure for epigastric pain and an amylase will be sent. Epigastric pain will be&#xD;
      assessed using a Likert scale in which 10 is the most severe pain, 0 is no pain, and a value&#xD;
      of greater than 3 signifies moderate or greater pain. A cutoff greater than 3 is used in an&#xD;
      effort not to include patients with mild transient discomfort due to retained air after&#xD;
      endoscopy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome measure for post ERCP pancreatitis will be based on if the patients have&#xD;
      significant epigastric pain and amylase greater than three times the upper limit of normal.&#xD;
      Those in the control group who develop pancreatitis will be given a 20cc/kg LR IV bolus and&#xD;
      treated with LR at 3cc/kg/hour. Patients who develop pancreatitis will be fasted and&#xD;
      otherwise the patients will be started on clears and subsequently their diet will be advanced&#xD;
      as tolerated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who develop pancreatitis will be followed twice daily until discharge in order to&#xD;
      define whether the episodes were mild (2-3 days hospitalization), moderate (4-10 days of&#xD;
      hospitalization), or severe (&gt;10 days hospitalization or complications including hemorrhagic&#xD;
      pancreatitis, pseudocyst, phlegmon, or requiring percutaneous or surgical procedure).&#xD;

&#xD;
      6.0 ASSESSMENT OF EFFICACY AND SAFETY&#xD;
&#xD;
      The major adverse outcome which could be associated with the therapy is clinical fluid&#xD;
      overload. Patients will be interviewed and examined for symptoms and signs that may suggest&#xD;
      this adverse reaction including chest pain, dyspnea or hypoxia as well as pleural effusion,&#xD;
      peripheral edema, ascites, anasarca, or pulmonary edema.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All adverse events will be reported to the principal investigator. These include event which&#xD;
      occur during the initial 24 hour of the procedure and at any time afterward. The entire study&#xD;
      team will meet to report adverse events on a biweekly basis. Reports of fluid overload will&#xD;
      be submitted to the IRB. Adverse events which occur during the trial will also be reviewed&#xD;
      with another faculty physician in the Gastroenterology Division.&#xD;

      8.0 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS&#xD;
&#xD;
      We are performing a single blind randomized study of aggressive versus standard fluids to&#xD;
      prevent post ERCP pancreatitis. While our long term goal is to assess whether&#xD;
      prophylactically treating patients undergoing ERCP with aggressive hydration will decrease&#xD;
      the incidence of post ERCP pancreatitis our current goal is to assess whether the study is&#xD;
      feasible and to assess how large the effect will be. Patients allocated to standard care will&#xD;
      be used to test this rate in our sample population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome of pancreatitis development within 8 hours of ERCP will be tested using&#xD;
      Fisher's exact chi-squared to compare the rate of pancreatitis between groups. Results from&#xD;
      this test will allow for estimation of sample size for a fully powered clinical trial. This&#xD;
      same method will be used to test the secondary aim of when pancreatitis was first detected (2&#xD;
      hours vs 8 hours), though given the small number of participants who will likely develop&#xD;
      pancreatitis (&lt; 15%) the primary aim of this comparison is to inform on monitoring and safety&#xD;
      for a fully powered trial. To test the secondary outcome of pain, a repeated measures ANOVA&#xD;
      will be used to compare pain ratings between groups at 2 and 8 hours. Because this is a pilot&#xD;
      study, the primary aim is to detect effect sizes and clinical relevance of outcomes..&#xD;
      Statistical analyses will be performed by biostatisticians at the Biostatistical and&#xD;
      Bioinformatics Resource Group within the SC CTSI.&#xD;
