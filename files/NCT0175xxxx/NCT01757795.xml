  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase I, single-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of the&#xD;
      safety, tolerability, and PK of escalating single doses and multiple doses of SP 8203 in&#xD;
      healthy adult male and female subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the SAD Part, the first cohort of 8 subjects will be randomly assigned to receive a single&#xD;
      IV dose of either SP-8203 (n=6) or placebo (n=2). Following medical review of safety, PK, and&#xD;
      biomarker data, subsequent cohorts of 8 new subjects will receive higher single doses of&#xD;
      SP-8203 (6 subjects) or placebo (2 subjects). Dose escalation will continue until a single&#xD;
      MTD of SP-8203 is identified. If a single-dose MTD is not defined within the projected dose&#xD;
      range, additional cohorts of 8 subjects may be added to receive higher doses to achieve the&#xD;
      objectives of the study. Alternate doses may be administered following medical review of the&#xD;
      results of each cohort.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the MAD Part of the study the first cohort of 8 subjects will receive a single dose of SP&#xD;
      8203 every day and 1 subject will receive a single dose of placebo every day for 7&#xD;
      consecutive days. Doses will be administered at the same time (Â± 15 minutes) every day.&#xD;
      Following medical review of all safety and biomarker data, subsequent cohorts of 7 drug-naive&#xD;
      subjects will receive higher single doses of SP-8203 (6 subjects) or placebo (2 subject)&#xD;
      every day for 7 consecutive days. Study drug dose-escalation will continue until a&#xD;
      multiple-dose MTD regimen of SP-8203 is identified. If a multiple-dose MTD is not defined&#xD;
      within this range, additional cohorts of 8 subjects may be added to achieve the objectives of&#xD;
      the study. Alternate doses and/or dosing regimens may be administered following medical&#xD;
      review of the safety, biomarker, and PK results of the SAD Part, and prior cohorts in the MAD&#xD;
      Part of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The MTD will be defined as the highest dose that does not lead to unacceptable toxicity in&#xD;
      one or more subjects based on the frequency, nature, and severity of AEs or other safety&#xD;
      parameter abnormalities. The Investigator, Sponsor, and Medical Monitor will jointly assess&#xD;
      the general safety and tolerability of each dose based on available data prior to escalating&#xD;
      to the next higher dose. Successive higher doses will be administered only if previous doses&#xD;
      are adequately tolerated. Intermediate doses may be tested, or a dose level may be repeated,&#xD;
      as appropriate, depending on the safety profile observed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each subject will complete Screening, Baseline, Treatment, and Follow-Up Phases. The&#xD;
      Screening Phase will be conducted on an outpatient basis within 30 days, but no sooner than 3&#xD;
      days, prior to the start of the Baseline Phase. The Baseline Phase will consist of admission&#xD;
      to the CRU and final qualification assessments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the SAD Part, the Treatment Phase will consist of dosing (after which subjects will be&#xD;
      considered enrolled in the study), postdose safety assessments, and blood and urine&#xD;
      collection for the next 48 hours. Subjects will be discharged approximately 48 hours after&#xD;
      study drug administration, provided all available assessments are clinically acceptable to&#xD;
      the Investigator, and will return for follow-up assessments 2-4 days later. In the MAD Part,&#xD;
      The Treatment Phase will last for 9 days following the first dose. Subjects will be dosed&#xD;
      each morning for 7 consecutive days. Safety assessments will be made, and blood and urine&#xD;
      will be collected prior to, and at prescribed intervals postdose, over the next 9 consecutive&#xD;
      days. Subjects will be discharged approximately 48 hours following the last dose, and will&#xD;
      return for follow-up assessments 2-4 days later.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety will be evaluated by physical examination, by evaluation of vital signs, 12 lead ECG,&#xD;
      Holter monitoring, clinical laboratory blood and urine test results, and AE assessments.&#xD;
      Blood samples for determining plasma concentrations of SP 8203 and its metabolites,&#xD;
      assessments of Mn-SOD mRNA, and FRAP biomarkers will be obtained immediately prior to dosing&#xD;
      and at prescribed intervals during the Treatment Phase. Urine samples will be collected&#xD;
      predose and pooled urine samples will be collected postdose for determination of SP 8203&#xD;
      renal clearance and metabolites.&#xD;
