      The purpose of this study is to investigate the effects of prolonged low-dose&#xD;
      methylprednisolone infusion on pulmonary function (LIS and ventilation-free days), extra&#xD;
      pulmonary organ function (PMODS score), inflammatory markers - RCP (Reactive C Protein), IL6&#xD;
      (Interleukine 6), TNFα (Tumor Necrosis Factor), IL8 (Interleukine 8), IL10 (Interleukine 10)&#xD;
      and length of Pediatric Intensive Care Unit (PICU) stay in early ALI/ARDS in children.&#xD;

      Scientific background. Dysregulated systemic inflammation - characterized by protracted&#xD;
      elevation of inflammatory cytokines in the circulation - is a key pathogenetic mechanism for&#xD;
      morbidity and mortality in ALI/ARDS, and is associated with tissue insensitivity and/or&#xD;
      resistance to inappropriately elevated endogenous glucocorticoids. In one study, prolonged&#xD;
      methylprednisolone treatment of ARDS patients resulted in rapid and sustained reduction in&#xD;
      circulating and pulmonary levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, chemokines, and procollagen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preliminary work. Two recent metanalysis evaluating the use of low doses of corticosteroids&#xD;
      in acute lung injury/ARDS in adults reported a significant physiological improvement, a&#xD;
      sizable reduction in duration of mechanical ventilation and ICU length of stay and reduction&#xD;
      in mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis. We hypothesized that prolonged administration of low doses of methylprednisolone&#xD;
      in pediatric ALI/ARDS is safe and downregulates systemic inflammation and leads to earlier&#xD;
      resolution of pulmonary and extra pulmonary organ dysfunction and a reduction in duration of&#xD;
      mechanical ventilation and ICU stay.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective. To investigate the effects of prolonged low-dose methylprednisolone infusion on&#xD;
      pulmonary function (LIS and ventilation-free days), extra pulmonary organ function (PMODS&#xD;
      score), inflammatory markers - RCP (Reactive C Protein), IL6 (Interleukine 6), TNFα (Tumor&#xD;
      Necrosis Factor), IL8 (Interleukine 8), IL10 (Interleukine 10) and length of Pediatric&#xD;
      Intensive Care Unit (PICU) stay in early ALI/ARDS in children.&#xD;

    <description>The patients in this arm will receive methylprednisolone, which is available in vials containing 125 mg/2mL after dilution, as it follows:&#xD;
Day 0 Loading dose 1 mg/kg IV bolus mixed in 5 mL NS (30 min) followed by continuous infusion Days 0 to 07 - 1 mg/kg/day mixed in 24cc NS and infused at 1 cc/hr Days 08 to 10 - 0.5 mg/kg/day mixed in 24cc NS and infused at 1 cc/hr Days 11 to 12 - 0.25 mg/kg/day Days 13 to 14 - 0.125 mg/kg/day</description>

    <description>Patients randomized to the control arm will receive sterile normal saline in an amount that would equal the total diluted dose of study drug (ie. if initial loading dose equals a total of 24 cc [methylprednisolone + diluting fluid], then the patient will receive 24 cc of sterile normal saline). Tapering doses will be equivalent to that of the study arm, so that investigators will remain blinded to therapy. The unblinded party will be composed of the research ARDS pharmacist. Five days after the patient is able to ingest medications, placebo is administered per os (PO) in one single daily equivalent dose. The placebo will be manipulated by the pharmacist as to resemble identical to the active drug.</description>
