      Despite maintaining adequate mean arterial pressure and central venous oxygen saturation, the&#xD;
      mortality is still high in severe sepsis and septic shock. Previous studies have demonstrated&#xD;
      that derangements in microvascular flow play a role in sepsis-induced multiple organ&#xD;
      dysfunction and death. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or endotoxin is a specific ligand for&#xD;
      Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), it can induce the following reactions including excessive immune&#xD;
      and inflammatory responses , oxidative stress , capillary leakage, endothelial damage,&#xD;
      impaired arteriolar and venular vasoregulation, and activation of the coagulation cascade 8.&#xD;
      Subsequently, these reactions can lead to microcirculatory dysfunction. Polymyxin B adsorber&#xD;
      hemoperfusion (PMX) have been proved to reduce mortality of severe sepsis and septic shock.&#xD;
      Since 1994 to 2007, more than 60,000 patients have received this treatment. In a systematic&#xD;
      review, the results show that PMX therapy was associated with significantly lower mortality&#xD;
      risk (risk ratio, 0.53; 95% CI, 0.43 to 0.65). In a prospective, multicenter, randomized&#xD;
      controlled trial (Early Use of Polymyxin B Hemoperfusion in Abdominal Sepsis [EUPHAS]), the&#xD;
      results show that SOFA scores improved in the polymyxin B group, and 28-day mortality was 32%&#xD;

      Introduction&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite maintaining adequate mean arterial pressure and central venous oxygen saturation, the&#xD;
      mortality is still high in severe sepsis and septic shock. Previous studies have demonstrated&#xD;
      that derangements in microvascular flow play a role in sepsis-induced multiple organ&#xD;
      dysfunction and death. Because of the clinical significance of microcirculatory dysfunction&#xD;
      in severe sepsis and septic shock, recent advances in image technology have been used to&#xD;
      investigate microcirculation. A sidestream dark-field (SDF) video microscope has been&#xD;
      developed to visualize the microcirculation, but its measurement of microvascular blood flow&#xD;
      classification is semi-quantitative. Previous studies have shown that a full-field laser&#xD;
      perfusion imager can quantitatively measure the change of microcirculatory blood flow&#xD;
      intensity. For clinical studies, sublingual microcirculation is most easily investigated&#xD;
      using a SDF video microscope.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Because lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or endotoxin is a specific ligand for Toll-like receptor 4&#xD;
      (TLR4), it can induce the following reactions including excessive immune and inflammatory&#xD;
      responses, oxidative stress , capillary leakage, endothelial damage, impaired arteriolar and&#xD;
      venular vasoregulation, and activation of the coagulation cascade. Subsequently, these&#xD;
      reactions can lead to microcirculatory dysfunction. Recently, a TLR4 antagonist, eritoran&#xD;
      tetrasodium (E5564), has been reported to inhibit LPS response without TLR4 agonistic&#xD;
      activity in animals as well as in humans, but it fails to reduce mortality of severe sepsis&#xD;
      and septic shock. Polymyxin B adsorber hemoperfusion (PMX) have been proved to reduce&#xD;
      mortality of severe sepsis and septic shock.Since 1994 to 2007, more than 60,000 patients&#xD;
      have received this treatment. In a systematic review, the results show that PMX therapy was&#xD;
      associated with significantly lower mortality risk (risk ratio, 0.53; 95% CI, 0.43 to&#xD;
      0.65).21 In a prospective, multicenter, randomized controlled trial (Early Use of Polymyxin B&#xD;
      Hemoperfusion in Abdominal Sepsis [EUPHAS]), the results show that SOFA scores improved in&#xD;
      the polymyxin B group but not in the conventional therapy group (change in SOFA, -3.4 vs&#xD;
      -0.1; P =0.001), and 28-day mortality was 32% in the polymyxin B group and 53% in the&#xD;
      conventional therapy group (unadjusted hazard ratio [HR], 0.43; 95% confidence interval [CI],&#xD;
      0.20-0.94; adjusted HR, 0.36; 95% CI, 0.16-0.80). Iba et al. have revealed that polymyxin B&#xD;
      hemoperfusion can maintain better microcirculation and survival in a septic rat model.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that polymyxin B hemoperfusion can decrease blood endotoxin&#xD;
      level and reduce endotoxin-related microcirculatory dysfunction. The purpose of this&#xD;
      prospective randomized controlled open study is to investigate the effect of polymyxin B&#xD;
      hemoperfusion on the sublingual microcirculation in patient with clear or suspected severe&#xD;
      sepsis and septic shock by gram-negative bacteria. The serum level of endotoxin, mean&#xD;
      arterial pressure, dose of vasopressors and inotropics, SOFA score, PaO2/FiO2 ratio, and&#xD;
      28-day mortality will be investigated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      This protocol was reviewed by the National Taiwan University Hospital Research Ethic&#xD;
      Committee(201208067RIB). Patients who meet the inclusion criteria and do not present any of&#xD;
      the exclusion criteria will be randomly assigned to one of the two groups (the control group&#xD;
      the PMX-HP group). In the control group, patients will receive standard treatment for sepsis&#xD;
      according to the practice guidelines. In the PMX-HP group, patients will receive standard&#xD;
      treatment for sepsis and polymyxin B hemoperfusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hemoperfusion will be performed in the intensive care units within 24h after diagnosis of&#xD;
      severe sepsis or septic shock. The 1st PMX-HP (day 0) will run for 2 hours. The 2nd PMX-HP&#xD;
      must be performed within 24 to 36 hours after the end of the 1st treatment, ideally 24 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The SDF video microscope (MicroScan, Microvision Medical) will be used to investigate total&#xD;
      small vessel (less than 20 Î¼m) density (TSVD), microvascular blood flow classification of&#xD;
      each small vessel, perfused small vessel density (PSVD), microvascular flow index (MFI), and&#xD;
      heterogeneity index (HI) of sublingual microcirculation. This device illuminates the tissues&#xD;
      with polarized green light and measures the reflected light from the tissue surface. Both&#xD;
      superficial capillaries and venules can be visualized because the scattered green light is&#xD;
      absorbed by haemoglobin of red blood cells which are contained in these vessels. At each time&#xD;
      point (0h, 24h, and 48h), five continuous image sequences (20 seconds) will be digitally&#xD;
      stored, and data of the best three images (at least, if possible five) will be averaged for&#xD;
      statistical calculation. The images will be analysed afterwards with automated analysis&#xD;
      software (AVA 3.0, Academic Medical Center, University of Amsterdam, Amsterdam, The&#xD;
      Netherlands). Total small vessel density is automatically calculated by the software. A&#xD;
      semi-quantitative method is used to classify the microvascular blood flow of each small&#xD;
      vessel as follows: (0) absent (no flow or filled with microthrombosis), (1) intermittent flow&#xD;
      (absence of flow for at least 50% of the time), (2) sluggish flow, and (3) continuous flow.&#xD;
      (Figure 1) Small vessels with blood flow classification of (2) and (3) are considered as&#xD;
      perfused small vessels, and the perfused small vessel density are automatically calculated.&#xD;
      To calculate MFI score, the image is divided into four quadrants, and the same ordinal scale&#xD;
      (0 to 3) is used to assess blood flow in each quadrant. The MFI score represents the averaged&#xD;
      values of the four quadrants. The heterogeneity index is calculated as the highest MFI minus&#xD;
      the lowest MFI divided by the mean MFI across the best three to five images at certain time&#xD;
      point.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety&#xD;
&#xD;
      The blood pressure, body temperature, BUN, creatinine, ALT, AST, bilirubin (total/direct),&#xD;
      lactate, sodium, potassium, and complete cell count will be monitored during the experiment.&#xD;
      Adverse effects of polymyxin B hemoperfusion (bleeding, nephrotoxicity, neurotoxicity&#xD;
      [agitation, weakness, drowsy, ataxia, numbness, blurred vision, and paresthesia],&#xD;
      thrombocytopenia, and altered coagulation.) will be monitored.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistics&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to our previous study, the total small vessel density of the patients in the&#xD;
      control group was 20.0 mm/mm2, 20 patients per group can detect a 12 % increase in total&#xD;
      small vessel density of the patients in the PMX-HP group with an Î± level of 0.05 and Î² level&#xD;
      of 0.8.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will be analysed using statistical software (SPSS 20; IBM SPSS, Chicago, IL). Means at&#xD;
      certain time point between the two groups are compared using t test. Means from serial&#xD;
      examinations between the two groups are compared using repeated measurement analysis of&#xD;
      variance (with the factors of time and group) followed by Tukey or Dunnett's T3 multiple&#xD;
      comparison tests. Data of MFI are expressed as median (interquartile range) and compared&#xD;
      using the Mann-Whitney analysis following with adjustment for multiple comparisons. A P value&#xD;
      &lt; 0.05 is considered to indicate a significant result.&#xD;
