  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cabazitaxel is already approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use in patients&#xD;
      with advanced prostrate cancer, following docetaxel therapy. The purpose of this study is to&#xD;
      better understand the response and toxicity of cabazitaxel of elderly men (age 75 years and&#xD;
      older) with advanced prostate cancer who have progressed during or after treatment with&#xD;
      docetaxel. All patients on this study will receive cabazitaxel by intravenous (through a&#xD;
      vein) infusion plus prednisone by mouth twice daily, and following the chemotherapy&#xD;
      infusions, an injection of a granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF). G-CSF will help&#xD;
      the body produce more white blood cells, which should help decrease the risk of getting an&#xD;
      infection while being treated with cabazitaxel.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single arm, open label, phase II trial of cabazitaxel every 3 weeks in patients who&#xD;
      are ≥ 75 years of age with castration-resistant, metastatic prostate cancer who have&#xD;
      progressed during or after docetaxel.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      -The primary objective is to determine the efficacy of cabazitaxel in men 75 years of age or&#xD;
      older with castration-resistant, metastatic prostate cancer who have progressed during of&#xD;
      following treatment with docetaxel.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To characterize the safety and tolerability of cabazitaxel in patients ≥ 75 years of age&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the PSA response&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the effect of cabazitaxel on functional status using geriatric assessments&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exploratory objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine the effect of therapy with cabazitaxel on the number of circulating tumor&#xD;
           cells (CTC)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To measure the effects of cabazitaxel on apoptosis in CTCs from patients ≥ 75 years of&#xD;
           age using H2AX and M30 as biomarkers.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the relationship between geriatric-focused assessment of comorbidity and&#xD;
           functional ability and toxicity and response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will receive cabazitaxel 25 mg/m2 every 3 weeks with 10 mg prednisone daily until&#xD;
      progression, intolerance of therapy, or withdrawal of consent. Patients will receive&#xD;
      granulocyte colony stimulating factor (Neulasta 6 mg sc) with each cycle, starting with the&#xD;
      first cycle, to minimize the risk of complications from neutropenia. Patients will be&#xD;
      followed for 28 days after discontinuation of therapy or death, whichever occurs first.&#xD;
      Patients with serious adverse events at the time of removal from the trial will be followed&#xD;
      until the toxicities resolve or are deemed irreversible by the treating physician.&#xD;
