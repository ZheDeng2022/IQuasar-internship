  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Current gold standard treatment for unstable (those found unstable in external rotation (ER)&#xD;
      stress testing Weber B-type, Lauge-Hansen supination-external rotation type IV) ankle&#xD;
      fractures is open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) with semitubular plates and screws.&#xD;
      However, there is some preliminary evidence to suggest that these type of fibula fractures&#xD;
      can be managed non-operatively with comparable functional outcome. The aim of this&#xD;
      randomized, non-inferiority trial is to assess whether non-operative treatment (cast&#xD;
      immobilisation) yields a non-inferior functional outcome compared to surgery with no excess&#xD;
      harms (primarily, fracture and wound healing problems and infection).&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Seventy per cent of ankle fractures are unimalleolar injuries, the Weber B -type of fibula&#xD;
      fracture being by far the most common type. The ankle mortise can either be stable or&#xD;
      unstable in this type of fracture depending on the accompanying soft tissue injury. The&#xD;
      stability of the ankle mortise has fundamental clinical relevance, as it dictates the&#xD;
      subsequent treatment strategy. If left untreated, an unstable ankle mortise may lead to&#xD;
      fracture healing complications and increased risk of post-traumatic osteoarthritis and&#xD;
      subsequently poor functional outcome. Therefore, current clinical practice guidelines&#xD;
      recommend surgical treatment for these injuries. The gold standard surgical treatment for&#xD;
      unstable ankle fractures is open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) using 1/3&#xD;
      semi-tubular plates and screws.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The most common complication following operative treatment of ankle fracture is wound&#xD;
      infection, the incidence ranging from 6.1 to10% in unselected patient materials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To date, there is only one published randomized trial comparing operative and non-operative&#xD;
      treatment in patients with an unstable unimalleolar fibula fracture. In this 1-year&#xD;
      follow-up, the authors concluded that patients managed nonoperatively had equivalent&#xD;
      functional outcomes compared with operative treatment; however, the risk of fracture&#xD;
      displacement and problems with union was substantially higher in patients managed&#xD;
      nonoperatively. In turn, 10/41 (24%) patients treated operatively were re-operated; five&#xD;
      patients had a post-operative infection and five patients required hardware removal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This prospective randomized non-inferiority trial is designed to compare surgical and&#xD;
      non-operative treatment of ER-stress positive unimalleolar ankle fractures. The primary,&#xD;
      non-inferiority, intention-to-treat outcome is the Olerud-Molander Ankle Score at 104 weeks&#xD;
      or 24 months (OMAS; range, 0-100; higher scores indicating better outcome and fewer&#xD;
      symptoms). The predefined non-inferiority margin for the primary outcome at the primary&#xD;
      assessment time point is 8 points. Secondary outcomes are ankle function, pain, quality of&#xD;
      life, ankle range of motion, and radiographic outcome. Follow-up assessments are performed at&#xD;
      2, 6, 12, and 104 weeks (primary time point). Treatment related complications and harms;&#xD;
      symptomatic non-unions, loss of congruity of the ankle joint, and wound infections are also&#xD;
      recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The ER-stress test is performed by a consultant trauma orthopedic surgeon or a trauma&#xD;
      resident who has completed trauma rotation. Medial clear space opening of 5 mm or more will&#xD;
      be considered a positive ER stress test. Patients are randomized to non-operative or surgical&#xD;
      treatment using a sealed envelope method. Surgical treatment is carried out using a standard&#xD;
      open reduction and internal fixation with 1/3 semitubular plate and screws. Post-operatively,&#xD;
      surgically treated ankles are placed in a below-the-knee cast for six weeks. They are advised&#xD;
      to carry out partial weight-bearing (15 to 20 kilograms) for the first four weeks and then&#xD;
      weight-bear as tolerated for the remaining two weeks. The non-operative treatment protocol is&#xD;
      similar to that of the surgically treated patients: six-week below-the-knee cast with partial&#xD;
      weight-bearing for the first four weeks and then weight-bearing as tolerated for the&#xD;
      remaining two weeks.&#xD;
