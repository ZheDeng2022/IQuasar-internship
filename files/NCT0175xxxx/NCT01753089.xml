    <textblock>
      This research study is a Phase I clinical trial. Phase I clinical trials test the safety of&#xD;
      investigational melanoma vaccines. Phase I studies also try to define the appropriate dose of&#xD;
      the investigational vaccine, in this case WDVAX, to use for further studies.&#xD;
      &quot;Investigational&quot; means that the vaccine is still being studied and that research doctors are&#xD;
      trying to find out more about it. It also means that the FDA has not yet approved WDVAX for&#xD;
      any use in patients, including people with Melanoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to determine if it is possible to make a vaccine against&#xD;
      melanoma by using your own melanoma tumor cells and combining them with other proteins which&#xD;
      activate the immune system. We hope that by combining the cells and the proteins in this way&#xD;
      that the vaccine will cause your own immune system to react against your melanoma tumor&#xD;
      cells. The purpose of this study is also to determine the safest way to give this vaccine&#xD;
      with the least amount of side effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each vaccine will contain your own tumor cells which have been killed by a freezing and&#xD;
      thawing process which destroys the cells but keeps the proteins from the melanoma cells. This&#xD;
      is called a &quot;tumor lysate&quot; Your tumor lysate is combined with other proteins which activate&#xD;
      the immune system. The other proteins are called GM-CSF and CpG. All of this is held together&#xD;
      to form a &quot;tablet&quot; or &quot;scaffold&quot; which is about the size of a regular aspirin tablet. The&#xD;
      material that holds the protein together is called PLGA. PLGA is the same material that&#xD;
      doctors use for &quot;dissolvable stitches&quot; If you have ever had a problem with these types of&#xD;
      stitches in the past, be sure to let your study doctor know about this.&#xD;

      After agreeing to participate you will be asked to undergo some screening tests or procedures&#xD;
      to confirm that you are eligible for the study. Many of these test and procedures are likely&#xD;
      to be part of regular cancer care and may be done even if it turns out that you do not take&#xD;
      part in the research study. If you have had some of these tests or procedures recently, they&#xD;
      may or may not have to be repeated. These procedures include: a medical history, physical&#xD;
      examination, performance status, assessment of your tumor and blood tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If these tests show that you are eligible to participate in the research study, you will be&#xD;
      referred to a study surgeon to prepare for the surgical removal of tumor tissue from which&#xD;
      your vaccine will be made. If, at the time of your surgery, the surgeons are not able to&#xD;
      obtain enough tumor cells for us to make your vaccine, then you will not be eligible to&#xD;
      participate in this research study. The surgery will be performed at Brigham and Women's&#xD;
      Hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The total number of vaccines to be administered to each participant is four. Since we are&#xD;
      looking for the shortest amount of time between doses that can be administered safely without&#xD;
      severe or unmanageable side effects in participants that have melanoma, not everyone who&#xD;
      participates in this research study will be on the same dose schedule to receive the vaccine.&#xD;
      For example, some participants will receive the vaccine once a month for 4 doses, the next&#xD;
      group will receive the vaccine every three weeks for 4 doses and the final group will receive&#xD;
      the vaccine every two weeks for four doses. The schedule for your vaccination will depend on&#xD;
      the number of participants who have been enrolled in the study before you and how well they&#xD;
      have tolerated their doses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before each vaccination and then 24 hours after each vaccination you will have a physical&#xD;
      exam and you will be asked questions about your general health and specific questions about&#xD;
      any problems that you might be having and any medications you may be taking.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will assess your tumor by CT scan and/or MRI before you start the vaccine, approximately&#xD;
      half-way through the vaccine schedule and then one month after completion of all four&#xD;
      vaccines. After that we will assess your tumor every three months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will monitor you for any side effects from the vaccine throughout all of the vaccine&#xD;
      administration and for one month following completion of vaccinations or until all side&#xD;
      effects are gone. We will assess your tumor again half-way through the vaccine&#xD;
      administrations, one month and three months after completing all four vaccinations and then&#xD;
      every three months after that. We will also continue to follow you to collect information&#xD;
      regarding any other therapies you receive after vaccination is complete to keep track of any&#xD;
      responses that you might have to other therapies in the future.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Further, we would like to keep track of your medical condition for the rest of your life. We&#xD;
      would like to do this by calling you on the telephone once a year to see how you are doing.&#xD;
      Keeping in touch with you and checking your condition every year helps us look at the long&#xD;
      term effects of the research study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Because different groups of participants will receive their vaccinations at different times&#xD;
      (depending on when you are enrolled), we will provide you with your own calendar that is&#xD;
      specific to the scheduling of your vaccine administration and all of your clinic visits and&#xD;
      tests. The over-all schedule for the research study plan is described below.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If after completion of screening you are still eligible and the tumor collection for your&#xD;
      surgery has been successful then there will be about a three week time period for you to&#xD;
      recover from the surgery and for us to make your vaccine in our laboratory at DFCI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As described above you will receive a total of four vaccinations. On the day you receive a&#xD;
      vaccination, you will first undergo blood tests, a brief physical exam and update of your&#xD;
      medical record. If you are still eligible ot proceed, one of the study surgeons will implant&#xD;
      the vaccine by first washing a small area on your arm, leg or torso with sterilizing soap.&#xD;
      Then they will make a small incision in your skin and create a small &quot;pocket&quot; between teh&#xD;
      upper layer of skin and the tissue underneath. Using sterile surgical tools they will slide&#xD;
      the vaccine &quot;tablet&quot; into this pocket and then use 2-3 stitches to close the incision. This&#xD;
      site will be covered with a sterile bandage and the surgeon will ask you to return the&#xD;
      following day so that he or she or one of the other study team members may check the vaccine&#xD;
      site.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Depending on when you are enrolled in the study, you will receive your vaccines either; every&#xD;
      4 weeks, every 3 weeks or every 2 weeks for a total of 4 vaccines. We will be able to tell&#xD;
      you the schedule at the time that you are enrolled on the study. We will be able to give you&#xD;
      a copy of your study calendar after our laboratory has processed your tumor sample.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If there are enough tumor cells left over from your vaccine preparation, we will irradiate&#xD;
      them to kill them and give them to you as an injection under the skin at the time of your&#xD;
      first vaccination and your last vaccination. This injection will be given at a site different&#xD;
      from where the vaccinations are placed. This is called a &quot;DTH test&quot; and is one way to help us&#xD;
      monitor activity of your immune system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you receive this DTH test, we will perform a small skin biopsy called a &quot;punch biopsy&quot; of&#xD;
      the DTH injection site about 3-5 days following the second DTH injection (3-5 days following&#xD;
      the last vaccination).&#xD;
&#xD;
      If we can see a vaccine injection site reaction (redness, swelling, etc.) at the vaccination&#xD;
      site then we will also perform a punch biopsy of the vaccination site about 3-5 days&#xD;
      following vaccination Number 2 and Number 4.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If at any time during the course of the vaccinations or after you complete all four&#xD;
      vaccinations you have easily accessible tumor that shows signs of an inflammatory reaction to&#xD;
      the vaccine we may also biopsy the tumor. The purpose of this is for us to learn what sort of&#xD;
      cells from the immune system may become activated against the tumor when you ar receiving&#xD;
      vaccine or following vaccination.&#xD;
