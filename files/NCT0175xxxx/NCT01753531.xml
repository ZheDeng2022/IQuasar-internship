  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The clinical performance of the Ultra Influenza A&amp;B Test will be demonstrated during a&#xD;
      clinical trial in which prospectively collected nasal swabs are used in identifying subjects&#xD;
      who are infected with the influenza virus strain type A or type B. The Ultra Influenza A&amp;B&#xD;
      Test qualitative results will be compared to &quot;Gold Standard&quot; viral culture with Direct&#xD;
      Fluorescent Antibody (DFA) confirmation techniques using nasal swabs collected from&#xD;
      symptomatic subjects. The Ultra Influenza A&amp;B Test will be performed at Clinical Laboratory&#xD;
      Improvement Amendments (CLIA) waived sites by untrained intended users (e.g. nurses,&#xD;
      physician assistants, medical assistants, etc.). For viral culture testing with DFA&#xD;
      confirmation testing, nasal swab specimen testing will be performed by a designated reference&#xD;
      laboratory.&#xD;

    <description>Demonstrate the ability of untrained intended users to effectively run and read the Ultra Influenza A&amp;B Test with insignificant risk of erroneous results. Qualitative results obtained using the Ultra Influenza A&amp;B Test will be compared to viral culture with direct fluorescent antibody (DFA) confirmation testing on specimens collected during this study. Data demonstrating ease of use will support a request to FDA for CLIA waived categorization of the assay.</description>
