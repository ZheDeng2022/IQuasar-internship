    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the benefit of immediate hormonal treatment after&#xD;
      Radical Prostatectomy in Chinese and Russian patients with high risk prostate cancer. To&#xD;
      reach this target, the trial will compare a group of patients treated with triptorelin at 8&#xD;
      weeks after the surgery and for a duration of 9 months (3 injections) versus another group&#xD;
      (called &quot;active surveillance group&quot;) who will be not receiving triptorelin. Both groups will&#xD;
      be followed every 3 months to monitor any sign of disease progression during a minimum of 36&#xD;
      months&#xD;

    <measure>Percent Change From Baseline in PSA Levels</measure>
    <time_frame>Screening (Day -14) and Months 3, 6, 9, 12, 24 and 36.</time_frame>
    <description>As per inclusion criterion, all subjects in both treatment groups had PSA levels ≤0.2 ng/mL at the screening visit. Starting from Month 3, any elevated PSA concentration &gt;0.2 ng/mL had to be confirmed by a second measurement performed 4 to 6 weeks later. No confirmation test was required after evidence of disease progression (BR and/or clinical disease progression). Subjects remained in the study until Month 36, even if they had a biochemical failure (PSA levels &gt;0.2 ng/mL); then they could enter follow-up. The percent change from baseline was defined as the percent change from the screening visit (Day -14). Percent change from baseline in PSA levels are reported as median values at Months 3, 6, 9, 12, 24 and 36. Note: the raw baseline values for PSA levels are reported in the Baseline Characteristics section.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Serum Testosterone Levels</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Day 1) and Months 3, 6 and 9.</time_frame>
    <description>Serum testosterone levels were evaluated on blood samples taken before triptorelin injection at baseline and at 3, 6 and 9 months only in subjects in the triptorelin arm. Change from baseline in testosterone levels are reported as median values at Months 3, 6 and 9. Note: the raw baseline values for testosterone levels are reported in the Baseline Characteristics section.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in FACT-P Total Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Day 1) and Months 9, 24 and 36.</time_frame>
    <description>Health-Related Quality of Life (HRQoL) was assessed using the FACT-P questionnaire (v4) at baseline and at 9, 24 and 36 months. The FACT-P score is composed of 27 general questions about physical, social, emotional, and functional well-being, as well as a 12-item questionnaire about prostate-specific concerns. The total FACT-P score was calculated as the sum of 39 item scores (range of 0-156); higher scores indicate a better quality of life. Change from baseline in FACT-P total score are reported as mean values at Months 9, 24 and 36. A negative change from baseline indicates decreased QoL. Note: the raw baseline values for FACT-P total score are reported in the Baseline Characteristics section.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in SF-36 Physical and Mental Component Summary Measures Norm-Based Scores (i.e. PCS and MCS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Day 1) and Months 9, 24 and 36.</time_frame>
    <description>HRQoL was assessed using the SF-36 health survey (v2) at baseline and at 9, 24 and 36 months. The 36 items cover 8 health domains: PF, role-physical, BP, SF, MH, RE, VT and GH. Subscale scores were normed to the 2009 US general population (mean=50; SD=10) to give norm-based scores. Two summary measures were then calculated: PCS was derived from PF, role-physical, BP and GH; MCS was derived from SF, MH, RE and VT. The PCS and MCS norm-based scores ranged 0-100; higher scores indicate a better QoL. Change from baseline in SF-36 PCS and MSC norm-based scores are reported as mean values at Months 9, 24 and 36. A negative change from baseline indicates decreased QoL. Note: the raw baseline values for PCS and MSC norm-based scores are reported in the Baseline Characteristics section.</description>

      <recruitment_details>The study was conducted in male subjects with high-risk prostate cancer who had undergone radical prostatectomy (RP) in 18 sites in China and Russia between Dec 2012 and Sep 2019. The study participation for each subject was at least 36 months. The end of study was when 61 biochemical relapse (BR) events were observed on the study global level.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>Subjects had to have undergone RP no more than 8 weeks prior to randomisation, with post-RP prostate specific antigen (PSA) levels ≤0.2 nanograms/millilitre (ng/mL). The screening visit took place 6 weeks after RP (i.e. 2 weeks prior to randomisation). No other treatment for prostate cancer was permitted.</pre_assignment_details>

          <title>36-Item Short Form Health Survey (SF-36) Score</title>
          <description>The SF-36 health survey contains 36 items covering 8 health domains: physical functioning (PF), role-physical, bodily pain (BP), social functioning (SF), mental health (MH), role-emotional (RE), vitality (VT) and general health (GH). Subscale scores were normed to the 2009 US general population (mean=50; standard deviation [SD]=10) to give norm-based scores. Two summary measures were then calculated: PCS was derived from PF, role-physical, BP and GH; MCS was derived from SF, MH, RE and VT. The PCS and MCS norm-based scores ranged 0-100; higher scores indicate a better QoL.</description>

          <title>Gleason Score Prior to RP - Total Score in Categories</title>
          <description>The Gleason score is an indication of prognosis based on prostate pathology. The total score ranges from 2 to 10 (ie, &quot;1+1&quot; to &quot;5+5&quot;) with a higher score reflecting less-differentiated tumors with worse prognosis. The total score is a sum of two numbers which are based on the microscopic appearance of cells. The first number is the score based on the dominant, cell morphology (scored 1-5) and the second number is based on the highest grade of the non-dominant cell pattern (scored 1-5).</description>

        <title>Percent Change From Baseline in PSA Levels</title>
        <description>As per inclusion criterion, all subjects in both treatment groups had PSA levels ≤0.2 ng/mL at the screening visit. Starting from Month 3, any elevated PSA concentration &gt;0.2 ng/mL had to be confirmed by a second measurement performed 4 to 6 weeks later. No confirmation test was required after evidence of disease progression (BR and/or clinical disease progression). Subjects remained in the study until Month 36, even if they had a biochemical failure (PSA levels &gt;0.2 ng/mL); then they could enter follow-up. The percent change from baseline was defined as the percent change from the screening visit (Day -14).

          <title>Percent Change From Baseline in PSA Levels</title>
          <description>As per inclusion criterion, all subjects in both treatment groups had PSA levels ≤0.2 ng/mL at the screening visit. Starting from Month 3, any elevated PSA concentration &gt;0.2 ng/mL had to be confirmed by a second measurement performed 4 to 6 weeks later. No confirmation test was required after evidence of disease progression (BR and/or clinical disease progression). Subjects remained in the study until Month 36, even if they had a biochemical failure (PSA levels &gt;0.2 ng/mL); then they could enter follow-up. The percent change from baseline was defined as the percent change from the screening visit (Day -14). Percent change from baseline in PSA levels are reported as median values at Months 3, 6, 9, 12, 24 and 36. Note: the raw baseline values for PSA levels are reported in the Baseline Characteristics section.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in FACT-P Total Score</title>
        <description>Health-Related Quality of Life (HRQoL) was assessed using the FACT-P questionnaire (v4) at baseline and at 9, 24 and 36 months. The FACT-P score is composed of 27 general questions about physical, social, emotional, and functional well-being, as well as a 12-item questionnaire about prostate-specific concerns. The total FACT-P score was calculated as the sum of 39 item scores (range of 0-156); higher scores indicate a better quality of life. Change from baseline in FACT-P total score are reported as mean values at Months 9, 24 and 36. A negative change from baseline indicates decreased QoL. Note: the raw baseline values for FACT-P total score are reported in the Baseline Characteristics section.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in SF-36 Physical and Mental Component Summary Measures Norm-Based Scores (i.e. PCS and MCS)</title>
        <description>HRQoL was assessed using the SF-36 health survey (v2) at baseline and at 9, 24 and 36 months. The 36 items cover 8 health domains: PF, role-physical, BP, SF, MH, RE, VT and GH. Subscale scores were normed to the 2009 US general population (mean=50; SD=10) to give norm-based scores. Two summary measures were then calculated: PCS was derived from PF, role-physical, BP and GH; MCS was derived from SF, MH, RE and VT. The PCS and MCS norm-based scores ranged 0-100; higher scores indicate a better QoL. Change from baseline in SF-36 PCS and MSC norm-based scores are reported as mean values at Months 9, 24 and 36. A negative change from baseline indicates decreased QoL. Note: the raw baseline values for PCS and MSC norm-based scores are reported in the Baseline Characteristics section.</description>
