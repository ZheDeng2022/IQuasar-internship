      Background: Acromegaly is a rare disease caused by GH hypersecretion from a pituitary&#xD;
      adenoma. The annual incidence is estimated to be 3-5/million with a prevalence of 100 -&#xD;
      150/million. The incidence rate is however uncertain since no nationwide surveys exist. If&#xD;
      left untreated or poorly controlled the condition is associated with progressive morbidity&#xD;
      and an excess mortality. The primary treatment is surgery, which however only provides a cure&#xD;
      rate of ≈ 50 -60% due to the size of the tumour. The second line treatment today is medical&#xD;
      treatment with slow release formulations of somatostatin analogs (SA) and, more recently, a&#xD;
      specific GH antagonist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Accurate data on incidence rates and outcome of treatment are of obvious importance in order&#xD;
      to provide optimal and evidence-based treatment for the disease. This is particularly&#xD;
      relevant in light of the availability of new and effective treatment modalities such as the&#xD;
      GH antagonist, the proper place of which in the treatment algorithm still remains&#xD;
      controversial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Denmark holds a unique position in terms of epidemiological studies due to the existence of&#xD;
      well organized databases which include all its inhabitants. A recognised problem with&#xD;
      epidemiological surveys from specialised centres is whether the figures are representative&#xD;
      for the general population. A nationwide Danish study will profit from the fact that every&#xD;
      Danish citizen holds a unique ID number that makes it easy to retrieve and combine pertinent&#xD;
      data regarding health, disease and death from different registries. The investigators have&#xD;
      previously used this for a landmark survey of another rare endocrine disease, i.e. Cushing's&#xD;
      syndrome. This publication has been cited more than 100 times.&#xD;
