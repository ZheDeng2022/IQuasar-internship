  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The cardiotoxicity of anthracyclines chemotherapy remains a major problem, despite clinical&#xD;
      and echocardiographic monitoring. In the case of treatment for breast cancer, surgery&#xD;
      requiring general anesthesia may follow chemotherapy. Although a possible interaction between&#xD;
      general anesthetics and anthracyclines on systolic function is only rarely mentioned, some&#xD;
      cases of heart failure and / or conduction disturbances peranesthésique were observed in&#xD;
      patients treated or previously treated with anthracyclines. The determination of&#xD;
      concentration of BNP is a diagnostic tool used in the detection of heart failure and acute&#xD;
      coronary syndromes. The question of a possible synergism between cardiotoxic anthracyclines&#xD;
      and anesthetic agents arises. Given its minimally invasive nature and its diagnostic value,&#xD;
      the BNP assay might thus allow to highlight a possible subclinical deficiency. To our&#xD;
      knowledge, there is very little data regarding a possible synergism between cardiotoxic&#xD;
      anthracyclines and anesthetic agents.&#xD;

      The cardiotoxicity of anthracyclines chemotherapy remains a major problem, despite clinical&#xD;

      cases of heart failure and / or conduction disturbances peranesthésique were observed in&#xD;
      patients treated or previously treated with anthracyclines. The determination of&#xD;
      concentration of BNP is a diagnostic tool used in the detection of heart failure and acute&#xD;
      coronary syndromes. In fact, it is one of the most sensitive markers of impaired myocardial&#xD;
      function, and an increase in interest rates may precede any other biological changes. In a&#xD;
      patient who received anthracycline, although it remains asymptomatic elevation of NT-proBNP&#xD;
      concentration may persist for some months after exposure, and that, whatever the doses&#xD;
      received. The question of a possible synergism between cardiotoxic anthracyclines and&#xD;
      anesthetic agents arises. Given its minimally invasive nature and its diagnostic value, the&#xD;
      BNP assay might thus allow to highlight a possible subclinical deficiency. To our knowledge,&#xD;
