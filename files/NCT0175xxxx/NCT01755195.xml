  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Cabozantinib is a cancer treatment drug that blocks the growth of new blood vessels in&#xD;
      tumors. It can also block a chemical on tumor cells that allows the cells to grow. A similar&#xD;
      drug, pazopanib, is used to treat types of cancer known as sarcomas. Researchers want to see&#xD;
      if cabozantinib can be an effective treatment for types of soft tissue sarcoma that have not&#xD;
      responded to earlier treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To test the effectiveness of cabozantinib for soft tissue sarcomas that have not responded&#xD;
      to standard treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Individuals at least 18 years of age who have soft tissue sarcomas that have not responded&#xD;
      to standard treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be screened with a physical exam and medical history. Blood samples&#xD;
           will be collected. Imaging studies and other tests will be used to study the tumor&#xD;
           before the start of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will take cabozantinib tablets daily for 28-day cycles of treatment. The&#xD;
           tablets should be taken whole on an empty stomach.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Treatment will be monitored with frequent blood tests and imaging studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will continue to take cabozantinib for as long as the tumor does not become&#xD;
           worse and the side effects are not too severe.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Soft tissue sarcomas (STS) are a relatively rare heterogeneous group of tumors that&#xD;
           constitute about 1% of adult cancers.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The mainstay of treatment for advanced disease has been palliative chemotherapy with a&#xD;
           median overall survival of approximately 12 months. This has not changed considerably in&#xD;
           the past years and there is an unmet need for newer targeted therapies.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) levels are elevated in patients with STS and&#xD;
           various sarcoma cell lines express high levels of activated c-Met receptor.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  We hypothesize that dual targeting of the VEGF and mesenchymal-epithelial transition&#xD;
           factor (c-MET) pathways with cabozantinib would result in clinical benefit in patients&#xD;
           with soft tissue sarcoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Assess the response rate (Complete Response (CR)+Partial Response (PR) of cabozantinib&#xD;
           in patients with soft tissue sarcomas.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Assess the 6 month progression free survival (PFS) of cabozantinib in soft tissue&#xD;
           sarcomas.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary:&#xD;
&#xD;
      -Determine and compare circulating levels of hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), soluble MET&#xD;
      (sMET), VEGF-A, and soluble vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (VEGFR2) (sVEGFR2)&#xD;
      prior to and following administration of cabozantinib.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients must have had disease progression following one line of standard therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Age greater than or equal to 18 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Adequate organ function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  All patients will receive cabozantinib at 60 mg by mouth (PO) daily in 4 week cycles.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Tumor response evaluations by imaging will be done every 2 cycles (less frequently for&#xD;
           patients on study more than one year).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The study will be conducted as a dual-endpoint two-stage Phase II trial to target&#xD;
           objective tumor response rate (CR+PR) of 30% against an unacceptably low rate of 10%,&#xD;
           and 6-month PFS rate of 65% against an unacceptably low rate of 45% (corresponding to&#xD;
           median PFS of 9.6 vs. 5.2 months).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The trial will accrue up to 55 patients.&#xD;

             is metastatic or unresectable and for which standard treatment that prolongs survival&#xD;
             does not exist or is no longer effective.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have measurable disease, defined as at least one lesion that can be&#xD;
             accurately measured in at least one dimension (longest diameter to be recorded for&#xD;
             non-nodal lesions and short axis for nodal lesions) as &gt;20 mm with conventional&#xD;
             techniques or as &gt;10 mm with spiral computed tomography (CT) scan, magnetic resonance&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Subjects must have blood pressure (BP) no greater than 140 mmHg (systolic) and 90 mmHg&#xD;
             (diastolic) for eligibility. Initiation or adjustment of BP medication is permitted&#xD;
             prior to study entry provided that the average of three BP readings at the time of&#xD;
             enrollment is less than or equal to 140/90 mmHg&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must be able to swallow whole tablets. Tablets must not be crushed or chewed.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The effects of cabozantinib on the developing human fetus are unknown. For this reason&#xD;
             and because receptor tyrosine kinases are known to be teratogenic, women of&#xD;
             child-bearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception. All subjects&#xD;
             of reproductive potential must agree to use both a barrier method and a second method&#xD;

&#xD;
        Sexually active subjects (men and women) must agree to use medically accepted barrier&#xD;
        methods of contraception (e.g., male or female condom) during the course of the study and&#xD;
        for 4 months after the last dose of study drug(s), even if oral contraceptives are also&#xD;
        used.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have had anticancer therapy, including kinase inhibitors or any&#xD;
             investigational agent within 4 weeks or 5 half-lives (whichever is shorter) (6 weeks&#xD;
             for nitrosoureas or mitomycin C) prior to entering the study or those who have not&#xD;
             recovered to baseline from adverse events (except alopecia and other non-clinically&#xD;
             significant adverse events (AEs). Patients who have received prior cabozantinib or&#xD;
             inhibitors of tyrosine-protein kinase mesenchymal epithelial transition factor (c-MET)&#xD;
             or hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) are ineligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The subject has received radionuclide treatment within 6 weeks of the first dose of&#xD;
             study treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The subject has received radiation therapy within 4 weeks (greater than or equal to 2&#xD;
             weeks for palliative radiation therapy)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with active brain metastases or carcinomatous meningitis or epidural disease&#xD;
             are excluded from this clinical trial. Subjects with brain metastases previously&#xD;
             treated with whole brain radiation or radiosurgery or subjects with epidural disease&#xD;
             previously treated with radiation who are asymptomatic and have remained stable for 4&#xD;
             weeks and do not require steroid treatment for at least 2 weeks before starting study&#xD;
             treatment are eligible. Neurosurgical resection of brain metastases or brain biopsy is&#xD;
             permitted if completed at least 3 months before starting study treatment. Baseline&#xD;
             brain imaging with contrast-enhanced CT or MRI scans for subjects with known brain&#xD;
             metastases is required to confirm eligibility.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Eligibility of subjects receiving any medications or substances known to affect or&#xD;
             with the potential to affect the activity of cabozantinib will be determined following&#xD;
             review of their cases by the Principal Investigator. Patients who are taking&#xD;
             enzyme-inducing anticonvulsant agents are not eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with refractory nausea and vomiting, chronic gastrointestinal diseases (e.g.,&#xD;
             inflammatory bowel disease), or significant bowel resection that could interfere with&#xD;
             absorption.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to symptomatic congestive&#xD;
             heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric&#xD;
             illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because cabozantinib has the potential for&#xD;
             teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Because there is an unknown but potential risk&#xD;
             for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with&#xD;
             cabozantinib, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated with&#xD;
             cabozantinib.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Strong inhibitors and inducers of cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) can affect levels of&#xD;
             cabozantinib and should be avoided whenever possible or switched to alternatives.&#xD;
             Subjects requiring chronic concomitant treatment of strong CYP3A4 inducers (e.g.,&#xD;
             dexamethasone, phenytoin, carbamazepine, rifampin, rifabutin, rifapentine,&#xD;
             phenobarbital, and St. John's Wort) are not eligible for this study. Because the lists&#xD;
             of these agents are constantly changing, it is important to regularly consult a&#xD;
             frequently-updated list such as http://medicine.iupui.edu/clinpharm/ddis/; medical&#xD;
             reference texts such as the Physicians Desk Reference may also provide this&#xD;
             information. As part of the enrollment/informed consent procedures, the patient will&#xD;
             be counseled on the risk of interactions with other agents, and what to do if new&#xD;
             medications need to be prescribed or if the patient is considering a new over&#xD;
             the-counter medicine or herbal product.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive patients on combination antiretroviral&#xD;
             therapy are ineligible because of the potential for pharmacokinetic interactions with&#xD;
             cabozantinib. Appropriate studies will be undertaken in patients receiving combination&#xD;
             antiretroviral therapy when indicated.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The subject requires concomitant treatment, in therapeutic doses, with anticoagulants&#xD;
             such as warfarin or warfarin-related agents, heparin, thrombin or Factor Xa&#xD;
             inhibitors, or antiplatelet agents (e.g., clopidogrel). Low dose aspirin (less than or&#xD;
             equal to 81 mg/day), low-dose warfarin (less than or equal to 1 mg/day), and&#xD;
             prophylactic low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) are permitted. (Please note that&#xD;
             there may be cases in which patients on study require anticoagulation for deep vein&#xD;
             thrombosis (DVT)/pulmonary embolism (PE) management; this does not necessitate taking&#xD;
&#xD;
        the patient off study.)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The subject has experienced any of the following&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  clinically-significant gastrointestinal bleeding within 6 months before the first&#xD;
                  dose of study treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  hemoptysis of greater than or equal to 0.5 teaspoon (2.5 mL) of red blood within&#xD;
                  3 months before the first dose of study treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  any other signs indicative of pulmonary hemorrhage within 3 months before the&#xD;
                  first dose of study treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The subject has radiographic evidence of cavitating pulmonary lesion(s).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The subject has tumor in contact with, invading, or encasing any major blood vessels&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The subject has evidence of tumor invading the gastrointestinal (GI) tract (esophagus,&#xD;
             stomach, small or large bowel, rectum or anus), or any evidence of endotracheal or&#xD;
             endobronchial tumor within 28 days before the first dose of cabozantinib&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The subject has uncontrolled, significant intercurrent or recent illness including,&#xD;
             but not limited to, the following conditions:&#xD;
&#xD;

HGF protein content (in picograms; pg) in blood plasma (in milliliters; mL) was measured for each sample with a two-site immunoassay and the difference from before to after treatment for each patient was reported. A change in this biomarker from the baseline value has not been linked to clinical outcomes; that is, it is neither a good or a bad outcome.</description>

        <description>Blood samples were collected before treatment on the first day of cycles 1 and 2 to determine circulating levels of soluble VEGFR2 (sVEGFR-2). sVEGFR-2 protein content (in nanograms; ng) in blood plasma (in milliliters; mL) was measured for each sample with a two-site immunoassay and the difference from before to after treatment for each patient was reported. A change in this biomarker from the baseline value has not been linked to clinical outcomes; that is, it is neither a good or a bad outcome..</description>

        <description>Here is the number of participants with serious and/or non-serious adverse events assessed by the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE v4.0). A non-serious adverse event is any untoward medical occurrence. A serious adverse event is an adverse event or suspected adverse reaction that results in death, a life-threatening adverse drug experience, hospitalization, disruption of the ability to conduct normal life functions, congenital anomaly/birth defect or important medical events that jeopardize the patient or subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the previous outcomes mentioned.</description>
