      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Failure of graft incorporation and tunnel widening (TW) after anterior cruciate ligament&#xD;
      (ACL) reconstruction has been frequently reported in the literature. The etiology of TW is&#xD;
      still not fully understood.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients and Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a prospective randomized study including 60 patients, conducted in a Level I trauma&#xD;
      center in Innsbruck, Austria. The study protocol was approved by the hospital ethics&#xD;
      committee. This study is planned and conducted following the Consolidated Standards on&#xD;
      Reporting Trials (CONSORT) guidelines. Aperture fixation is performed using BioComposite&#xD;
      interference screws (Arthrex, Naples, FL). Extracortical fixation is performed using the ACL&#xD;
      Tightrope (Arthrex, Naples, FL). TW is measured on CT scan postoperative, after 6 and 24&#xD;
      months. Clinical outcome is determined at 1, 2 after reconstruction, IKDC with KOOS&#xD;
      Knee-related QoL subscale, Lysholm, Tegner Activity scores, hop tests and KT-1000&#xD;
      measurements are performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this randomized controlled trail is to determine the influence of two&#xD;
      different fixation methods on TW and clinical outcome after anatomic ACL reconstruction using&#xD;
      hamstring graft in young and active patients.&#xD;

      The study is a randomized controlled clinical trial and will be conducted at the&#xD;
      Traumasurgery Innsbruck. Two different surgical methods are tested: ACL Tightrope&#xD;

           dial test and external rotation thigh foot angle test),&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Pregnancy and scope to become within next time&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. A history of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or a disorder of the coagulative system&#xD;
&#xD;
        9. Claustrophobia&#xD;
&#xD;
       10. General systemic disease affecting physical function, any other condition or treatment&#xD;

           pacemaker or motion disorders&#xD;
&#xD;
       11. Chronic systemic use of steroids&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following inclusion and exclusion criteria have to be met:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The ACL injury can be either &quot;isolated&quot; or combined with one or several of the following&#xD;
           injuries visualized on MRI and/or arthroscopy:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  A meniscus tear that is either left untreated or treated with a partial resection&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  A small, stable meniscus tear treated with fixation, but fixation not interfering&#xD;
                with the rehabilitation protocol&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Cartilage changes verified on MRI with arthroscopically determine intact surface&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. A radiographic examination with normal joint status or combined with either one of the&#xD;
           following finding:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  A small avulsed fragment located laterally, usually described as a Second fracture&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  JSN grade 1 or osteophytes grade 1 as determined by the OARSI atlas (Altman et al.&#xD;
                1995)&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Agreement to participate in the study and signed informed consent prior to inclusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion:&#xD;
&#xD;
      1.Presence of one of the following associated injuries to the index knee as visualized on MRI&#xD;
      and/or arthroscopy:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  An unstable longitudinal meniscus tear that requires repair and where the following&#xD;
           postoperative treatment (i.e. bracing and limited ROM) interferes with the&#xD;
           rehabilitation protocol&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Bi-compartmental extensive meniscus resection&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A cartilage injury representing a full thickness loss down to bone&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A total rupture of MCL/LCL as visualized on MRI&#xD;
&#xD;
      A power analysis was performed, estimating that a minimum of 34 patients (17 in each group)&#xD;
      would be required to obtain a power more than 80%.&#xD;
