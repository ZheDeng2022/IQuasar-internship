  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This randomized phase II trial studies the effects of erismodegib (LDE225) on disseminated&#xD;
      tumor cells (DTCs) in patients with stage III-III estrogen receptor (ER)-negative and human&#xD;
      epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-negative breast cancer. The presence of DTCs after&#xD;
      completing treatment for breast cancer may be linked to recurrence of the disease. LDE225 may&#xD;
      eliminate DTCs in bone marrow and reduce the risk of recurrence.&#xD;

             ductal or invasive lobular breast carcinoma. ER negative is defined as an Allred score&#xD;
             of 0-2. PR negative is defined as an Allred score of 0-4. HER2 negative is defined as&#xD;
             an IHC score of 0-1 and/or not-amplified by FISH testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  All surgery for breast cancer (as defined by surgical excision of the cancer with a&#xD;
             negative margin or mastectomy) must be complete.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Undergone axillary lymph node surgery (either sentinel lymph node biopsy or axillary&#xD;
             lymph node dissection) per institutional standard.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Completed all (neo) adjuvant chemotherapy and radiation therapy as recommended by the&#xD;
             treating physicians.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Completed the most recent cancer therapy (surgery, radiation, or chemotherapy) no less&#xD;
             than 3 and no more than 24 weeks prior to registration. Note: patients who received&#xD;
             experimental neoadjuvant or adjuvant therapy or surgical therapy (with the exception&#xD;
             of Hh inhibitors) through participation in clinical trial are NOT excluded from this&#xD;
             study as long as the other trial does not exclude patients from enrolling into an&#xD;
             additional adjuvant clinical trial and enrolling into this trial will not compromise&#xD;
             the endpoints (primary and secondary) of the primary clinical trial. In addition,&#xD;
             patients must have completed the experimental therapy no less than 4 weeks or 5 half&#xD;
             lives (whichever is longer) and no more than 24 weeks prior to registration. For those&#xD;
             patients who have enrolled into a neoadjuvant / adjuvant / surgical trial, all&#xD;
             endpoints of these trials will be reviewed prior to consenting the patient for the&#xD;
             sonidegib trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  At least 18 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  ECOG performance status â‰¤ 1&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient (or legally authorized representative if applicable) must be able to&#xD;
             understand and willing to sign an IRB approved written informed consent document.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Pre-Registration Exclusion Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Concurrent treatment with any other standard therapy (e.g. chemotherapy, targeted&#xD;
             therapy or radiotherapy) or within 3 weeks of starting sonidegib.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Treatment with investigational anti-cancer agent within 4 weeks or 5 half-lives&#xD;
             whichever is longer, of initializing treatments with sonidegib.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Previous treatment with systemic sonidegib or with other Hh pathway inhibitors.&#xD;
&#xD;

             treatment with drugs that are recognized to cause rhabdomyolysis (such as HMG CoA&#xD;
             inhibitors (statins), clofibrate and gemfibrozil) and that cannot be discontinued at&#xD;
             least 2 weeks prior to starting sonidegib treatment. If it is essential that the&#xD;
             patient stays on a statin to control hyperlipidemia, only pravastatin may be used with&#xD;
             extra caution.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Known to be HIV-positive on combination antiretroviral therapy because of the&#xD;
             potential for pharmacokinetic interactions with sonidegib. In addition, these patients&#xD;
             are at increased risk of lethal infections when treated with marrow-suppressive&#xD;
             therapy. Appropriate studies will be undertaken in patients receiving combination&#xD;
             antiretroviral therapy when indicated.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Registration Inclusion Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Presence of bone marrow DTCs after the completion of all intended breast cancer&#xD;
             therapy including surgery, (neo) adjuvant chemotherapy therapy, and radiation as&#xD;
             indicated. Note: Bone marrow aspiration will be performed in consented patients to&#xD;
             evaluate DTCs provided patients meet all eligibility criteria as described in this&#xD;
             section.&#xD;
&#xD;

             IUS, abstinence) prior to study entry duration of study participation and 20 months&#xD;
             after final dose of study treatment. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is&#xD;
             pregnant while participating in this study, she must inform her treating physician&#xD;
             immediately.&#xD;
&#xD;

             treatment. Muscular activities, such as strenuous exercise, that can result in&#xD;
             significant increases in plasma CK levels should be avoided while on sonidegib&#xD;
             treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Diagnosis of a medical condition that would lead to lack of physical integrity of the&#xD;
             upper gastrointestinal tract or known malabsorption syndrome.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Taking warfarin and Coumadin derivatives because of potential interactions with&#xD;
             sonidegib.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Receiving treatment with medications known to be moderate or strong inhibitors or&#xD;
             inducers of CYP3A4/5 or drugs metabolized by CYP2B6 or CYP2C9 that have narrow&#xD;
             therapeutic indices and that cannot be discontinued before starting treatment with&#xD;
             sonidegib. Medications that are strong CYP3A4/5 inhibitors should be discontinued at&#xD;
             least 7 days and strong CYP3A4/5 inducers at least 2 weeks prior to starting treatment&#xD;
             with sonidegib.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Concurrent uncontrolled medical conditions that may interfere with participation in&#xD;
             the study or potentially affect the interpretation of the study data.&#xD;

             of the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Angina pectoris within 3 months&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Acute myocardial infarction within 3 months&#xD;

               -  Other clinically significant heart disease (e.g., congestive heart failure,&#xD;
                  uncontrolled hypertension, history of labile hypertension, or history of poor&#xD;
                  compliance with an antihypertensive regimen)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant and/or breastfeeding. Pregnant women are excluded from this study because&#xD;
             sonidegib is an Hh inhibitor with the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient&#xD;
             effects. Because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing&#xD;
             infants secondary to treatment of the mother with sonidegib, breastfeeding should be&#xD;
             discontinued if the mother is treated with sonidegib.&#xD;
