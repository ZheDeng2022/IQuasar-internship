  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Based on the Doppler effect, Laser Doppler Imaging (LDI) uses the interaction of light with&#xD;
      moving erythrocytes to visualize perfusion in the microcirculatory system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The new device to be used in this study have been adapted specifically for the application,&#xD;
      facilitating its use in clinic. It has been designed to take a standard white light image of&#xD;
      the area under inspection simultaneously with the perfusion image to facilitate clinical&#xD;
      assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Port-wine stain (PWS) birthmarks are congenital, low-flow vascular malformations of the skin&#xD;
      found in approximately 0.3% of children. They are commonly found on the face and neck and may&#xD;
      cause serious psychological consequences.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lasers are the modality of choice for the treatment of PWS birthmarks. The use of PDL is very&#xD;
      effective in PWS in closing the blood vessels and diminishing therefore the redness of the&#xD;
      skin. Repeated laser treatment is necessary to achieve the desired clinical outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Actually, the efficacy of the treatment of PWS by the laser is obtained by clinical&#xD;
      inspection and digital photography.&#xD;
&#xD;
      By measuring the activity and intensity of the microcirculation present in and under the&#xD;
      skin, the Laser-Doppler (LDI) will be capable of measuring the effect of Pulsed dye laser&#xD;
      (PDL) treatment for port-wine stains.&#xD;
