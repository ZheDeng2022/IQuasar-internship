    <measure>Number of Investigator's Global Assessment (IGA) Responders at Day 29 Following Treatment With ASB17061 Capsules or Placebo in Adults With Atopic Dermatitis</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to 29 days after initial dose.</time_frame>
    <description>Participants with an IGA score of 0 or 1 were considered IGA responders. The investigator provided an overall assessment of disease severity using the IGA, which consists of a 6-point scale from a minimum of 0 and a maximum of 6. Higher scores indicate a worse outcome and lower scores indicate a better outcome. (0 = clear; 1 = almost clear; 2 = mild disease; 3 = moderate disease, 4 = severe disease; and 5 = very severe disease).</description>

    <measure>Number of Investigator's Global Assessment (IGA) Responders By Subgroup at Day 29 Following Treatment With ASB17061 Capsules or Placebo in Adults With Atopic Dermatitis</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to 29 days after initial dose.</time_frame>
    <description>Participants with an IGA score of 0 or 1 were considered IGA responders. The investigator provided an overall assessment of disease severity using the IGA which consists of a 6-point scale from the minimum of 0 to a maximum of 6. Higher scores indicate increasing severity.. (0 = clear; 1 = almost clear; 2 = mild disease; 3 = moderate disease, 4 = severe disease; and 5 = very severe disease) and an overall assessment of the disease severity of the entire body using the Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI). A composite index, the EASI has a minimum score of 0 (clear) and a maximum score of 72 (very severe); A value less than 15 indicates less severe, and 15 or greater indicates more severe. Lichenification was evaluated on a scale of 0 (none) as the minimum to 3 (severe) as the maximum, and the score of each body region was summed (0 to 12). A percent body surface area (BSA) involved less than 15 is less severe and 15 or greater more severe.</description>

    <measure>Mean Change From Baseline in Eczema Area and Severity Index Score (EASI) Following Treatment With ASB17061 Capsules or Placebo in Adult Participants With Atopic Dermatitis at Day 29</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to 29 days after initial dose.</time_frame>
    <description>The investigator provided an overall assessment of the disease severity of the entire body using the EASI. A composite index, the EASI has a minimum score of 0 (clear) and a maximum score of 72 (very severe); with a negative value indicating decreasing severity of eczema compared to baseline and a decreasing change in the EASI score. A negative value is an indication of a decrease in individual scores.</description>

    <measure>Mean Change From Baseline in The Percentage of Body Surface Area (BSA) Involved Following Treatment With ASB17061 Capsules or Placebo in Adult Participants With Atopic Dermatitis at Day 29</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to 29 days after initial dose.</time_frame>
    <description>Participants' body surface area affected by atopic dermatitis was assessed for the change in percentage after treatment. A negative value indicates a decrease in the percent of body surface area (BSA) involved. A negative value is an indication of a decrease in individual scores.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Mean Change From Baseline in Pruritus Score Following Treatment With ASB17061 Capsules or Placebo in Adult Participants With Atopic Dermatitis at Day 29</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to 29 days after initial dose.</time_frame>
    <description>Participants assessed the overall intensity of pruritus using a 4-point scale with 0 as the minimum and 3 as the maximum. (0 = absent; 1 = mild; 2 = moderate; and 3 = severe) A negative value indicates a decreasing change in the pruritus score. A negative value is an indication of a decrease in individual scores.</description>

    <measure>Mean Change From Baseline in Insomnia Score Following Treatment With ASB17061 Capsules or Placebo in Adult Participants With Atopic Dermatitis at Day 29</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to 29 days after initial dose.</time_frame>
    <description>Participants assessed the extent of their insomnia using an 11-point scale ranging from the minimum, 0 (no insomnia) to the maximum, 10 (severe insomnia). A negative value indicates a decreasing change in the insomnia score. A negative value is an indication of a decrease in individual scores.</description>

    <description>A treatment-emergent adverse event (TEAE) was defined as an AE that emerges during treatment, having been absent at pre-treatment; or reemerges during treatment, having been present at baseline but stopped prior to treatment; or worsens in severity during treatment after initiating the study drug.</description>

        <description>Participants with an IGA score of 0 or 1 were considered IGA responders. The investigator provided an overall assessment of disease severity using the IGA which consists of a 6-point scale from the minimum of 0 to a maximum of 6. Higher scores indicate increasing severity.. (0 = clear; 1 = almost clear; 2 = mild disease; 3 = moderate disease, 4 = severe disease; and 5 = very severe disease) and an overall assessment of the disease severity of the entire body using the Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI). A composite index, the EASI has a minimum score of 0 (clear) and a maximum score of 72 (very severe); A value less than 15 indicates less severe, and 15 or greater indicates more severe. Lichenification was evaluated on a scale of 0 (none) as the minimum to 3 (severe) as the maximum, and the score of each body region was summed (0 to 12). A percent body surface area (BSA) involved less than 15 is less severe and 15 or greater more severe.</description>

A composite index, the EASI has a minimum score of 0 (clear) and a maximum score of 72 (very severe); with a negative value indicating decreasing severity of eczema compared to baseline and a decreasing change in the EASI score.

          <title>Mean Change From Baseline in Insomnia Score Following Treatment With ASB17061 Capsules or Placebo in Adult Participants With Atopic Dermatitis at Day 29</title>
          <description>Participants assessed the extent of their insomnia using an 11-point scale ranging from the minimum, 0 (no insomnia) to the maximum, 10 (severe insomnia). A negative value indicates a decreasing change in the insomnia score. A negative value is an indication of a decrease in individual scores.</description>
