    <textblock>
      This is a non-randomized, concurrent control study, designed to confirm that the efficacy of&#xD;
      the NovoTTF-100A System in patients with recurrent GBM treated in a real life settings&#xD;
      following approval is comparable to that of BSC chemotherapy patients. The device is a&#xD;
      portable, battery operated device that was approved for the treatment of adult patients (22&#xD;
      years of age or older) with histologically-confirmed glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), following&#xD;
      histologically- or radiologically-confirmed recurrence in the supra-tentorial region of the&#xD;
      brain after receiving chemotherapy. The device is intended to be used as a monotherapy, and&#xD;
      is intended as an alternative to standard medical therapy for GBM after surgical and&#xD;
      radiation options have been exhausted.&#xD;

      PAST CLINICAL EXPERIENCE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The effect of the electric fields generated by the NovoTTF-100A device (TTFields, TTF) has&#xD;
      been tested in a large prospective, randomized trial, in 237 recurrent GBM patients. The&#xD;
      outcome of subjects treated with the NovoTTF-100A device was compared to those treated with&#xD;
      an effective best standard of care chemotherapy (including bevacizumab). NovoTTF-100A&#xD;
      subjects had comparable overall survival to subjects receiving the best available&#xD;
      chemotherapy in the US today. Similar results showing comparability of NovoTTF-100A to BSC&#xD;
      chemotherapy were seen in all secondary endpoints.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recurrent GBM patients treated with the NovoTTF-100A device in this trial experienced fewer&#xD;
      side effects in general, significantly fewer treatment related side effects, and&#xD;
      significantly lower gastrointestinal, hematological and infectious adverse events compared to&#xD;
      controls. The only device-related adverse events seen were a mild to moderate skin irritation&#xD;
      beneath the device electrodes. Finally, quality of life measures were better in NovoTTF-100A&#xD;
      subjects as a group when compared to subjects receiving effective best standard of care&#xD;
      chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESCRIPTION OF THE TRIAL:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with GBM whose disease has first recurred despite standard treatment (Surgery,&#xD;
      radiation therapy, Temozolomide treatment) and meet all of the requirements for participation&#xD;
      in the study will be recruited to one of two groups based on patient preference alone:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Treatment with the NovoTTF-100A device, or&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Treatment with the best standard of care practiced at each of the participating centers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If recruited to the best standard of care group, patients will receive a chemotherapeutic&#xD;
      agent chosen based on their prior treatments and the standard of care practiced at each&#xD;
      treating center.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If recruited to the NovoTTF-100A group, the patients will be treated continuously until tumor&#xD;
      progression. NovoTTF-100A treatment will consist of wearing four electrically insulated&#xD;
      electrodes on the head. Electrode placement will require shaving of the scalp before&#xD;
      treatment. Patients will continue treatment at home where they can maintain their regular&#xD;
      daily routine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the trial, regardless of whether assigned to the NovoTTF-100A treatment group or the&#xD;
      best standard of care group, patients will need to return once every month the hospital&#xD;
      outpatient clinics where they will be examined by a physician. These routine visits will&#xD;
      continue for as long as the patient's disease is not progressing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the visits to the clinic patients will be examined physically and neurologically, as&#xD;
      well as fill in neuro-cognitive questionnaires. Adverse events data will be collected from&#xD;
      all patients.. After this follow up plan, patients will be contacted once per month by&#xD;
      telephone to answer basic questions about their health status.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SCIENTIFIC BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
      TTFields are alternating electric fields of low intensity. This means that they change their&#xD;
      direction repetitively many times a second. Since they change direction very rapidly (200&#xD;
      thousand times a second), they do not cause muscles to twitch, nor do they have any effects&#xD;
      on other electrically activated tissues in the body (brain, nerves and heart). Since the&#xD;
      intensities of TTFields in the body are very low, they do not cause heating.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The breakthrough finding made by NovoCure was that finely tuned alternating fields of very&#xD;
      low intensity, now termed TTFields (Tumor Treating Fields), cause a significant slowing in&#xD;
      the growth of cancer cells. Due to the unique geometric shape of cancer cells when they are&#xD;
      multiplying, TTFields cause the building blocks of these cells to move and pile up in such a&#xD;
      way that the cells physically explode. In addition, cancer cells also contain miniature&#xD;
      building blocks which act as tiny motors in moving essential parts of the cells from place to&#xD;
      place. TTFields cause these tiny motors to fall apart since they have a special type of&#xD;
      electric charge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As a result of these two effects, cancer tumor growth is slowed and can even reverse after&#xD;
      continuous exposure to TTFields.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Other cells in the body (normal healthy tissues) are affected much less than cancer cells&#xD;
      since they multiply at a much slower rate if at all. In addition TTFields can be directed to&#xD;
      a certain part of the body, leaving sensitive areas out of their reach.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In conclusion, TTField hold the promise of serving as a brand new cancer treatment with very&#xD;
      few side effects and promising affectivity in slowing or reversing this disease.&#xD;
