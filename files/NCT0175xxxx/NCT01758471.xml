      This study is aimed to investigate the effect of acarbose on intestinal microbiome and&#xD;
      incretins, therefore to explore the new pathways or new targets to treat type 2 diabetes.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In recent years, Endocrinologist and Diabetologists have found that intestine might serve as&#xD;
      a novel target for treating diabetes or other metabolic diseases. Incretins are well-known&#xD;
      hormones secreted from intestine, such as CCK（Cholecystokinin), Serotonin, GIP(gastric&#xD;
      inhibitory polypeptide) and GLP-1(glucagon like peptide 1), to help control wholesome&#xD;
      metabolic status through their effects on pancreatic islet cells, hypothalamus neurons and&#xD;
      gastrointestinal movement. Gut microbiome has been recently revealed exerting major effect on&#xD;
      host's immune system and metabolic balance with its various metabolites and components.&#xD;
&#xD;
      α-glucosidase inhibitors have been used as anti-diabetes medicine for dozens of years. They&#xD;
      are known to be effective by delaying glucose absorption in small intestine. Questions then&#xD;
      have been arisen that if delaying glucose absorption changes the intestinal bacteria flora&#xD;
      component by increasing bacteria fed on glucose, or that if it influences incretin secretion,&#xD;
      since most glucose sensitive L cell (secreting GLP-1) were located in the distal part of&#xD;
      small intestine and colon, and that if the hypoglycemia effect of α-glucosidase inhibitors&#xD;
      might be mediated by either intestinal flora or incretins.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To address the questions above and to find the new targets from the intestine to treat&#xD;
      diabetes, we therefore design this study, taking advantage of clinical trial and basic&#xD;
      biomedical studies to find if α-glucosidase inhibitor- Acarbose (Bayer, Corp.) could change&#xD;
      the profile of intestinal incretins and microbiome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Multi-center, open label, randomized, positive control cohort.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. 110 cases of newly-diagnosed Type-2 Diabetes patients from five clinic centers from&#xD;
           Shanghai, China Mainland.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. All patients will sign the consent and screened by the criteria before enrolled by this&#xD;
           study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. 55 cases of Type 2 Diabetes will be assigned to glucobay treatment and another 55 will&#xD;
           take glipizide.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. 50 healthy volunteers for baseline data comparison.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. The duration of whole study will be 3 month.&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Before treatment, all the patients will be required to have OGTT(oral glucose&#xD;
                tolerant test) and IRT(insulin release test) test and give their feces. Standard&#xD;
                meals will be required one day before the feces are collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. In 3 months, all patients will take the medicine and their glucose will be&#xD;
                monitored closely by visiting outpatient office once a month.&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. In the end of the study, patients will be required to receive OGTT and IRT and give&#xD;
                their feces again.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Serum and feces will be stored at -80℃ for further biomarkers investigation and&#xD;
           microbiome sequencing.&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. After 3 months intervention, patients will be observed for another 3 month with access&#xD;
           to routine clinic visiting.&#xD;
