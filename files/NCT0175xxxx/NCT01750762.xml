    <textblock>
      This research is a Phase I clinical trial. Phase I clinical trials test the safety of an&#xD;
      investigational drug. Phase I studies also try to define the appropriate dose of the&#xD;
      investigational drug to use for further studies. &quot;Investigational&quot; means that the drug is&#xD;
      still being studied and that research doctors are trying to find out more about it. It also&#xD;
      means that the FDA has not approved lenalidomide for your type of cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lenalidomide is a drug that alters the immune system and it may also interfere with the&#xD;
      development of tiny blood vessels that help support tumor growth. Therefore, this study will&#xD;
      determine the effect of lenalidomide on the growth of cancer cells. Lenalidomide is approved&#xD;
      by the FDA for the treatment of specific types of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and in&#xD;
      combination with dexamethasone for patients with multiple myeloma (MM) who have received at&#xD;
      least 1 prior therapy. MDS and MM are cancers of the blood. It is currently being tested in a&#xD;
      variety of cancer conditions. In this case it is considered experimental.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are some participants with multiple myeloma or lymphoma who have had very long&#xD;
      remissions after a bone marrow/stem cell transplantation from another person. This is&#xD;
      believed to be the effect of the donor's immune system reaction against the recipient's&#xD;
      multiple myeloma cells. It is hoped that due to lenalidomide altering the immune system, it&#xD;
      might be able to potentiate that reaction. This study is being done to determine if the use&#xD;
      of lenalidomide is safe in transplant participants and if it can facilitate an immune&#xD;
      reaction resulting in regression of the myeloma or lymphoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During this study you will be evaluated for side effects from the treatment with lenalidomide&#xD;
      (including graft versus host disease) and for response of the myeloma to the treatment. There&#xD;
      will be two groups of participants in the study. The first group will be treated at a&#xD;
      relatively low dose of lenalidomide. If this is found to be safe then the second group will&#xD;
      be treated at a higher dose&#xD;

      If you agree to participate in this research study you will be asked to undergo some&#xD;
      screening tests or procedures to find out if you are eligible. Many of these tests and&#xD;
      procedures are likely to be part of regular cancer care and may be done even if it turns out&#xD;
      that you do not take part in the research study. If you have had some of these tests or&#xD;
      procedures recently, they may or may not have to be repeated. These tests and procedures&#xD;
      include: complete medical history, physical examination, blood collection, disease&#xD;
      assessment, bone marrow aspirate, electrocardiogram and HIV/Hepatitis blood test. If these&#xD;
      tests show that you are eligible to participate in the research study, you will begin the&#xD;
      study treatment. If you do not meet the eligibility criteria, you will not be able to&#xD;
      participate in this research study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since we are looking for the highest dose of the study drug that can be administered safely&#xD;
      without severe or unmanageable side effects in participants that have lenalidomide, not&#xD;
      everyone who participates in this research study will receive the same dose of the study&#xD;
      drug. The dose you get will depend on the number of participants who have been enrolled in&#xD;
      the study before you and how well they have tolerated their doses. The total duration of the&#xD;
      treatment on this study is 12 weeks or three cycles of 28 days each. At the beginning of each&#xD;
      cycle you will receive all the lenalidomide capsules that you will need to take for that&#xD;
      cycle. If you take more than the prescribed dose of lenalidomide you should seek emergency&#xD;
      medical care if needed and contact study staff immediately. Females of childbearing potential&#xD;
      that may be caring for you should not touch the lenalidomide capsules or bottles unless they&#xD;
      are wearing gloves.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the treatment you will be seen in the clinic every two weeks. At every visit the&#xD;
      following will be performed: Complete medical history and physical exam, blood collection and&#xD;
      research blood testing. If you have myeloma, at the beginning of each cycle you will undergo&#xD;
      a disease assessment with blood and urine tests. Any unused Revlimid (lenalidomide) should be&#xD;
      returned as instructed through the RevAssist program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After you have completed taking the drug on the study, the following procedures and tests&#xD;
      will take place: Complete medical history and physical examination, blood collection, disease&#xD;
      assessment, bone marrow aspirate/biopsy and research blood testing. You will be on the study&#xD;
      treatment for about three months and will be followed every three months after your treatment&#xD;
      ends for two years.&#xD;
