      The purpose of this study is to assess the safety of ranolazine in people with pulmonary&#xD;
      arterial hypertension (PAH) and who are receiving 1 or more background PAH therapies:&#xD;
      ambrisentan, sildenafil,tadalafil, epoprostenol, treprostinil (IV, SC, inhaled), or iloprost.&#xD;
      The primary objective is:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To estimate the effect of ranolazine administration on acute hemodynamics.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess safety of ranolazine acutely over 6 hrs in the catheterization lab and after&#xD;
           12 weeks of therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess changes in right ventricular function after 12 weeks of therapy.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Pulmonary arterial hypertension is a medical disorder in which pressure in the blood vessels&#xD;
      going from the right side of the heart to the lungs is higher than normal. The increased&#xD;
      blood pressure in the lungs places a strain on the heart. This strain causes the heart to&#xD;
      pump less blood into the lungs, causing physical symptoms of shortness of breath and&#xD;
      tiredness. The added strain to the heart can cause physical symptoms of swelling in the feet&#xD;
      and abdomen. These symptoms can get worse over time due to the decreased pumping ability of&#xD;
      the heart.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will use a drug called ranolazine. This drug has been approved by the Food and&#xD;
      Drug Administration (FDA) to treat chronic angina (chest pain). However, since it has not&#xD;
      been approved for use in PAH its use in this study is considered experimental.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  All subjects age 18-72 yrs will have a diagnosis of PAH. PAH as defined as idiopathic&#xD;
             PAH, heritable PAH or PAH associated with collagen vascular disease, congenital heart&#xD;
             disease (repaired), or anorexigen use. A history of PAH as defined by hemodynamics at&#xD;
             diagnosis by right heart catheterization defined as: mean PAP &gt;25 mmHg with a normal&#xD;
             PCWP &lt; 15 mm Hg at rest and a PVR &gt;3 Wood units.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Baseline 6MW &gt;150 meters&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients will be receiving FDA approved PAH monotherapy or dual therapy medications:&#xD;
