  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to find out more about tests used to estimate the number of eggs&#xD;
      a woman has remaining in her ovaries (her 'ovarian reserve'). It is thought that women who&#xD;
      have a greater number of eggs or ovarian reserve may have a better chance of successful in&#xD;
      vitro Fertilisation (IVF) treatment than those who have a smaller number of eggs. Accurately&#xD;
      predicting the likely outcomes of IVF would be of great benefit for counselling patients&#xD;
      before they go through expensive and demanding treatments such as IVF and IVF with&#xD;
      Intracytoplasmic sperm injection (IVFICSI).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Over the past two decades, many endocrine and ultrasound markers have been designed and are&#xD;
      now used as indicators of ovarian reserve. A number of screening tests are utilized to&#xD;
      measure these markers, either by ultrasound scanning techniques or taking blood samples.&#xD;
      However it is not yet known which, if any, best predict the outcome of IVF treatment. We&#xD;
      would like to investigate these various measures of ovarian reserve to determine which are&#xD;
      most accurate, particularly for predicting live birth rates, as up to now only poor to&#xD;
      moderate quality evidence has been available for this outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This will be a prospective cohort study of 300 women who already intend to undergo&#xD;
      IVF/IVF-ICSI treatment. Study participants will have one extra blood sample and ultrasound&#xD;
      examination, for the purposes of measuring markers of their ovarian reserve, at the start of&#xD;
      their IVF/IVFICSI treatment cycle. No other interventions will be required and their&#xD;
      treatment cycle will not be affected by their participation in the study.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participant is willing and able to give informed consent for participation in the&#xD;
             study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Female, aged 18 years or above.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  First cycle of ovarian stimulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Suitable for standard 'long protocol' IVF/IVF-ICSI cycle.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The participant does not understand the English language, or has special communication&#xD;
             needs. This is because it is impractical to provide, for this small scale study,&#xD;
             information sheets and consent forms in other languages except English.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients unsuitable for standard 'long protocol' IVF/IVFICSI cycle&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Presence of endometrioma or any other kind of ovarian cyst &gt; 20mm diameter.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Presence of Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome.&#xD;
