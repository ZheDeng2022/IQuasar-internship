    <textblock>
      The information derived from this study will be critical to establishing appropriate&#xD;
      rehabilitative interventions post-stroke. In particular, traditional use of pharmacological&#xD;
      agents to alter motor function post-stroke is directed primarily at reducing the &quot;positive&quot;&#xD;
      signs following upper motor neuron lesion, in particular spasticity, or enhanced,&#xD;
      velocity-dependent stretch reflex responses to imposed stretch. While pharmacological&#xD;
      management of spasticity certainly suppresses clinical and quantitative measures of&#xD;
      hypertonia, there is little improvement in functional performance. In contrast, preliminary&#xD;
      data on the administration of 5HT agents following neurological injury indicates an increase&#xD;
      in motor performance (Pariente 2001) and recovery (Dam 1996), despite an increase in spastic&#xD;
      motor activity (Stolp-Smith 1999; see Preliminary Data below). Understanding methods to&#xD;
      maximize function following stroke despite potential, short-term increases in spastic motor&#xD;
      activity may improve therapeutic intervention strategies. The general objective of this study&#xD;
      is therefore to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. quantify the effects of short-term SSRI administration on voluntary and spastic motor&#xD;
           behaviors in individuals with chronic spastic hemiparesis,&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. identify the changes in impairments and functional recovery of walking ability during&#xD;
           BWSTT with the presence or absence of SSRIs.&#xD;

      Walking ability post-stroke is characterized primarily by reduced walking speed and endurance&#xD;
      and impaired postural stability which limits functional and societal reintegration. Decreased&#xD;
      over ground walking speed is a result of decreased cadence, decreased stride length and&#xD;
      increased non-paretic single limb stance duration. Mechanisms underlying reduced velocity are&#xD;
      thought to include weakness in the paretic limb, particular hip flexor and plantarflexor&#xD;
      strength, but may also be linked spastic motor behaviors and loss of inter- and intra-limb&#xD;
      coordination. Rehabilitation efforts to improve strength and muscle coordination patterns&#xD;
      during hemiparetic gait may improve gait quality and velocity and therefore improve&#xD;
      performance of activities of daily living.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To improve gait performance and functional outcomes following neurological injury,&#xD;
      rehabilitation efforts have focused on re-establishing normal walking patterns . Towards this&#xD;
      end, the use of body-weight supported treadmill training (BWSTT) has demonstrated significant&#xD;
      improvement in walking capability in individuals post-stroke and spinal cord injury . By&#xD;
      supporting a portion of a subject's body weight over a treadmill and providing manual&#xD;
      facilitation from therapists, previous research has demonstrated improvements in&#xD;
      temporal-spatial gait patterns, including gait velocity , endurance (Macko 2005), balance ,&#xD;
      and symmetry. Importantly, the changes in impairments and functional limitations observed&#xD;
      with intensive BWSTT are often greater than that achieved during conventional or lower&#xD;
      intensity physical therapy. Given these benefits, particularly in those who require&#xD;
      substantial walking assistance following stroke various robotic locomotor retraining devices&#xD;
      have been developed to facilitate practice of &quot;kinematically correct&quot; stepping patterns to&#xD;
      improve the consistency and duration of treadmill training.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While the changes observed following BWSTT are statistically and functionally significant, it&#xD;
      remains unclear is the benefits of such intensive training paradigms are optimized.&#xD;
      Specifically, across many larger studies in subjects with chronic stroke (i.e., those &gt; 6 mo.&#xD;
      post-injury), mean increases in walking speed range between 0.09 m/s to 0.15 m/s following&#xD;
      1-6 mos. of training. Even in current trials investigating changes in over ground walking&#xD;
      speed in robotic- vs. therapist-assisted BWSTT, mean improvements over at least 18 subjects&#xD;
      in each group vary from 0.07 to 0.13 m/s, respectively (please see Preliminary work: Pilot&#xD;
      Study 1). While again statistically significant, such changes represent an approximate 10%&#xD;
      improvement in gait speed as compared to healthy adults (Perry 1992).&#xD;
&#xD;
      To enhance the benefits of intensive BWSTT, many investigators continue to search for&#xD;
      combined interventions to augment recovery. One potential adjunct that has received attention&#xD;
      is the use of pharmacological agents. For example, anti-spastic medications (e.g.,&#xD;
      benzodiazepine, baclofen, tizanidine) have been used for decades (to reduce the presence or&#xD;
      severity of involuntary, spastic reflexes in patients with stroke. Spasticity has&#xD;
      traditionally been thought to be a primary limitation to functional mobility post-stroke,&#xD;
      although this premise has been questioned recently . Indeed, many pharmacological agents are&#xD;
      effective in reducing spastic motor behaviors although evidence for improvements in function&#xD;
      following use of these agents post-stroke is limited. In addition, some evidence suggests&#xD;
      that these agents reduce maximal voluntary strength and can impair learning of motor tasks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      New evidence has emerged of a potentially powerful role of excitatory or facilitative&#xD;
      modulatory agents in the treatment of motor impairments post-stroke. Based primarily on&#xD;
      evidence from experimentally induced lesions in mammals, the application of monoaminergic&#xD;
      (i.e., serotonin [5HT] and norepinephrine [NE]) agents excite vs. depress spinal or cortical&#xD;
      excitability have gained momentum. In individuals post-stroke, for example, the use of&#xD;
      amphetamines (directed primarily through NE pathways) had generated substantial interest as&#xD;
      an adjunct to physical therapy interventions, although recent data may suggest no benefit&#xD;
      from this agent. Further, the use of amphetamines may enhance the risk of cerebral or&#xD;
      coronary vascular disease, which is already compromised in this patient population, and&#xD;
      therefore limit the use of these agents in clinical practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In contrast, 5HT agents have also been shown to enhance spinal and/or cortical excitability,&#xD;
      and may accelerate locomotor recovery following neurological injury when appropriate physical&#xD;
      interventions are provided . In humans post-stroke, one study has demonstrated enhanced motor&#xD;
      performance and cortical activity following a single dose of SSRIs. In another study of&#xD;
      sub-acute stroke, SSRIs and not selective NE reuptake inhibitors improved function during&#xD;
      inpatient rehabilitation. Interestingly, a small case report indicates a strong increase in&#xD;
      spasticity following use of 5HTergic anti-depressive agents, indicating that both spinal and&#xD;
      cortical excitability may contribute to altered motor function. Such findings have been&#xD;
      replicated here (please see Preliminary work: Pilot Study I, although certainly require&#xD;
      further assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While the above findings are preliminary, two important questions arise. First, if both&#xD;
      spastic and voluntary lower extremity activity are simultaneously altered following&#xD;
      administration of commonly used anti-depressive medications, how does the relation between&#xD;
      these variable alter motor function? Echoing tothers, how important is the prevalence of&#xD;
      spasticity to impaired motor function post-stroke? Secondly, can the increased excitability&#xD;
      of both spinal and cortical systems following SSRI accelerate motor recovery and the&#xD;
      effectiveness of intensive physical rehabilitation strategies, as shown in reduced&#xD;
      preparations? Such data are important for health care professionals treating individuals with&#xD;
      neurological injury to: A) understand the previously unknown modulation in reflex or&#xD;
      voluntary function following a seemingly innocuous agent; and, to B) provide the optimal&#xD;
      neural excitability to accelerate motor performance and recovery post-injury.&#xD;
