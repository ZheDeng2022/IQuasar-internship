    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies the side effects and how well giving paclitaxel and&#xD;
      cyclophosphamide with or without trastuzumab before surgery works in treating patients with&#xD;
      previously untreated breast cancer. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as paclitaxel and&#xD;
      cyclophosphamide, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing&#xD;
      the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Monoclonal antibodies, such as trastuzumab, may&#xD;
      block tumor growth in different ways by targeting certain cells. Giving combination&#xD;
      chemotherapy with or without trastuzumab before surgery may make the tumor smaller and reduce&#xD;
      the amount of normal tissue that needs to be removed.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate the toxicities and tolerability of a neoadjuvant dose-dense regimen&#xD;
      cyclophosphamide and paclitaxel with or without trastuzumab/radiation therapy (as clinically&#xD;
      indicated) in patients with newly diagnosed stage T1cN0 and II-III breast cancer; followed by&#xD;
      maintenance trastuzumab in human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) positive OR&#xD;
      adriamycin (doxorubicin hydrochloride) followed by radiation therapy (RT) in stage II-III&#xD;
      triple negative HER2 (-), estrogen receptor (ER) (-), progesterone receptor (PR) (-) stage&#xD;
      T1cN0 and II-III breast cancer patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To determine the pathological complete response rate (pCR) of this treatment regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To identify possible gene expression profile signatures from whole genome array analysis&#xD;
      that correlate with clinical response/resistance to chemotherapy as measured by pathologic&#xD;
      complete response rate (pCR).&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      NEOADJUVANT THERAPY: Patients receive paclitaxel intravenously (IV) over 3 hours and&#xD;
      cyclophosphamide IV over 1 hour on day 1. Patients with HER2-positive cancer also receive&#xD;
      trastuzumab IV over 30 minutes on day 1. Treatment repeats every 14 days for up to 6 courses&#xD;
      in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients without metastasis&#xD;
      undergo mastectomy or breast conserving surgery 4-8 weeks later.&#xD;
&#xD;
      POST-SURGERY/SYSTEMIC THERAPY:&#xD;
&#xD;
      HER2-POSITIVE PATIENTS: Patients receive standard radiation therapy. Patients also receive&#xD;
      trastuzumab IV over 30 minutes on day 1. Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 13 courses&#xD;
      in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ER/PR POSITIVE PATIENTS: Patients receive standard adjuvant hormonal or endocrine therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STAGE T1cN0 TRIPLE NEGATIVE PATIENTS: Patients receive standard radiation therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STAGE II-III TRIPLE NEGATIVE PATIENTS: Patients receive doxorubicin hydrochloride IV over 15&#xD;
      minutes on day 1. Treatment repeats every 14 days for up to 4 courses in the absence of&#xD;
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients also receive standard radiation&#xD;
      therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 2 years, and&#xD;
      then annually thereafter.&#xD;
