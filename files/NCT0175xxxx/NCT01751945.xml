  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether an integrated EmONC package (community&#xD;
      mobilization, training of community-based health care providers and a maternal and neonatal&#xD;
      health pack) reduce perinatal and neonatal mortality.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Deaths during birth are particularly critical to address as these occur because of&#xD;
      complications during childbirth and leads to emergency situation with a slim window of time&#xD;
      to intervene. Every year an estimated 3.6 million newborns and 360,000 mothers die globally.&#xD;
      Of these, maternal health complication contribute to 1.5 million of neonatal deaths in the&#xD;
      first week of life and 1.4 million stillborn neonates, suggesting a major gap of intervention&#xD;
      subsists around childbirth and in the early postnatal period, a time when mothers and babies&#xD;
      are most at risk. While many factors contribute to maternal and neonatal deaths, one of the&#xD;
      most effective means of solving this problem requires effective preventive measures or&#xD;
      treatment provided rapidly to women and newborns, often at home or in primary health care&#xD;
      settings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is often addressed that these overwhelming mortalities and morbidities are closely linked&#xD;
      with a number of interrelated delays that prevent a pregnant women from accessing the health&#xD;
      care she needs. Each delay is closely related to services, logistics, facilities and&#xD;
      conditions, which are important elements for their health. These delays are: 1) delay in&#xD;
      seeking appropriate medical help for an obstetric emergency or neonatal complication for&#xD;
      reasons of cost, lack of recognition of an emergency, poor education, lack of access to&#xD;
      information and gender inequality; 2) delay in reaching an appropriate facility for reasons&#xD;
      of distance, infrastructure and transport; 3) delay in receiving adequate care when a&#xD;
      facility is reached because there are shortages in staff, their competency, or due to&#xD;
      unavailability of required medical facilities and equipment. As a result, many preventable&#xD;
      maternal deaths occur, most often in resource poor settings, where births are home-based and&#xD;
      in the event of complications the woman is unable to access the required care in time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While many proven, cost-effective ways to save the lives of mothers, and newborns exist, they&#xD;
      are not always available to those who need them most. There is bulk of literature that has&#xD;
      identified number of interventions that can improve maternal and newborn health. The lancet&#xD;
      maternal and neonatal survival series emphasized the model of &quot;Basic essential obstetric&#xD;
      care&quot; as one of the most feasible and effective strategies to reduce maternal mortalities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the reasons above, it is essential to create demand of uptake of services and strengthen&#xD;
      primary health care infrastructure at the community level, and improve the liaison of Lady&#xD;
      Health Workers/Traditional Birth Attendants/Community Midwives with local and district health&#xD;
      system for early and timely referral of complicated cases and sick newborns. While several&#xD;
      previous studies from Pakistan have documented the beneficial impact of community-based&#xD;
      interventions in improving maternal and new-born health, further evidence is required to&#xD;
      assess the effectiveness of community-based interventions that can increase the uptake of&#xD;
      EmONC services and reduce the delays that are responsible for poor maternal and new-born&#xD;
      health. Context-specific evidence is also needed on the appropriate mix of interventions,&#xD;
      their delivery strategies, task shifting and sharing options, functional link and assessment&#xD;
      in the primary health care, and complementary health systems and community support and demand&#xD;
      mechanisms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, the main target audience and beneficiary of this project is the women which&#xD;
      usually do not have a say in the decision making and cannot have choices for her to opt for a&#xD;
      better treatment. The women usually depend upon the decisions being made by the husbands and&#xD;
      elders as the society is male dominant. We have attempted to take care of this factor to&#xD;
      maximize the uptake of intervention and services by developing the community support groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The specific objectives of this study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To conduct an in-depth analysis of maternal and neonatal health seeking patterns and&#xD;
           behaviors of the target population and care provision at health facilities for&#xD;
           understanding the context and requirements for improved EmONC service delivery.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To provide a maternal and neonatal health pack(clean delivery kit, emollient,&#xD;
           chlorhexidine, sms health messages) for safe motherhood and newborn well-being.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To mobilize community for creation of demand for improved MNH services and practices&#xD;
           through community mobilization.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To train and implement integrated EmONC package for community-level health care&#xD;
           providers (Lady Health Workers, Traditional Birth Attendants, Community Midwives to&#xD;
           provide antenatal, natal and postnatal care services, and recognize and refer&#xD;
           complicated pregnancy and childbirth cases and sick newborns to health facilities.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. To strengthen and improve the quality of care at health facilities in providing EmONC&#xD;
           services through capacity building of health care providers.&#xD;
