  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the role of endotracheal suction on the occurrence&#xD;
      of meconium aspiration syndrome in depressed meconium stained babies. Meconium aspiration&#xD;
      syndrome (MAS) is believed to result from aspiration of meconium and consequent chemical&#xD;
      pneumonitis. Meconium can be aspirated into the lungs in the womb as well. Meconium in the&#xD;
      distal airways is not accessible to endotracheal (ET) suction which clears only the windpipe.&#xD;
      Furthermore there is growing evidence in support of asphyxia-hypoxia-acidosis in the&#xD;
      causation of lung disease. Moreover, in the absence of a clear role of ET suction in&#xD;
      depressed meconium stained newborns, critical time could be lost in assessment, intubation&#xD;
      and ET suction (range: 30 seconds to 1 min) which might delay the definitive step of&#xD;
      ventilation for resuscitation of such babies that can potentially affect the outcome&#xD;
      adversely.The utility or futility of endotracheal suction in preventing MAS in depressed&#xD;
      meconium stained neonates has not been systematically studied and there is inadequate&#xD;
      information in literature in favor or against this practice.Thus this study is an attempt to&#xD;
      evaluate the effect of endotracheal suction on the occurrence of MAS in depressed full term&#xD;
      neonates born through meconium stained amniotic fluid (MSAF).&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Approximately 10-15% of deliveries are complicated by the passage of meconium around the time&#xD;
      of delivery.An adverse intrauterine environment with resultant fetal asphyxia is proposed as&#xD;
      the most common explanation for in-utero passage of meconium.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aspiration of meconium into the tracheo-bronchial tree with the onset of respiration results&#xD;
      in meconium aspiration syndrome (MAS). MAS is defined as respiratory distress in an infant&#xD;
      born through MSAF with compatible chest x-ray findings whose symptoms cannot be otherwise&#xD;
      explained.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite current interventions such as intubation and tracheal suction, it is estimated that&#xD;
      5-20 % of infants born through MSAF develop MAS. It represents a leading cause of perinatal&#xD;
      morbidity. Approximately 50% of the infants with MAS require mechanical ventilation; 15%-30%&#xD;
      develop pulmonary air leaks and 5%-12% die.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are various proposed mechanisms by which meconium causes lung injury, some of the&#xD;
      important ones being&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Mechanical obstruction of airways&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Chemical pneumonitis&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Vasoconstriction of pulmonary vessels&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Inactivation of surfactant&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Activation of compliment&#xD;
&#xD;
      Finding of meconium below cords or in the trachea has been shown to be associated with&#xD;
      development of MAS. This resulted in use of endotracheal suction along with&#xD;
      oro-nasopharyngeal suctioning in all infants born to mothers with MSAF prior to the year&#xD;
      2000.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although, a number of studies performed did not show reduction in incidence of MAS and/or&#xD;
      mortality even after performing oro-nasopharyngeal and endotracheal suction, the practice was&#xD;
      continued due to lack of robust evidence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subsequently, as a result of well performed randomized controlled trials and systematic&#xD;
      review showing no effect of oro-nasopharyngeal suctioning on occurrence of MAS, this practice&#xD;
      has been abandoned since the year 2005.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ET suction is currently performed in depressed meconium stained neonates with the idea of&#xD;
      removing meconium from the upper airways to relieve mechanical obstruction and to prevent&#xD;
      subsequent development of chemical pneumonitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since meconium aspiration can occur in-utero as well and with time the aspirated meconium&#xD;
      migrates peripherally, the effectiveness of ET suction post-delivery in clearing the airway&#xD;
      is not clear. Furthermore, accumulating evidence points to potential role of&#xD;
      hypoxia-asphyxia-acidosis with concomitant presence of meconium in the pathogenesis of lung&#xD;
      disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Current practice of Endotracheal suctioning in non-vigorous babies has not been&#xD;
      systematically evaluated, till date. No studies have compared the incidence, severity and&#xD;
      outcomes of MAS in 'suctioned versus non-suctioned' non vigorous meconium stained neonates.&#xD;
      In addition, the procedure needs expertise to be completed in the stipulated time and has&#xD;
      potential for complications like vocal cord injury, laryngeal edema, bleeding from upper&#xD;
      airway secondary to trauma during the procedure and persistent hoarseness of voice even at&#xD;
      six months of age. The rate of complications is more when performed by people with lesser&#xD;
      expertise as this is a difficult skill to learn and master.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In view of the foregoing the contribution of endotracheal suction in preventing MAS and its&#xD;
      effect on severity of lung disease is not clear. Thus this study is an attempt to evaluate&#xD;
      the role of endotracheal suction in non-vigorous meconium stained neonates.&#xD;
