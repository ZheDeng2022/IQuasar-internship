    <textblock>
      Blood pressure (BP) measurement is one of the most commonly performed screening tests in the&#xD;
      clinical setting. Its accuracy is vital to the early diagnosis and effective management of&#xD;
      hypertension, as emphasized by hypertension management guidelines. For most protocols being&#xD;
      conducted in a clinical research setting, obtaining single or serial blood pressure&#xD;
      reading(s) is often performed as a safety assessment, especially if the individual is&#xD;
      participating in a study that requires a blood draw and/or the administration of a research&#xD;
      drug, vaccine or device. It is imperative that the blood pressure data truly reflect the&#xD;
      response, if any, the study participant experiences in relation to the research procedures&#xD;
      and interventions.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Despite the clear guidelines on manual blood pressure technique, there seems to be large&#xD;
      inter-observer variations, both among nursing staff and physicians. These differences are&#xD;
      further complicated by variables such as cuff selection and application, incorrect cuff&#xD;
      positioning and rapid cuff deflation rate, inadequate rest period, and lack of repeated&#xD;
      measurements. The blood pressure measurement obtained by an automated device is not as&#xD;
      dependent on observer training and competency as the manual mercury device, yet its use&#xD;
      requires careful patient evaluation for caffeine or nicotine use, cuff position, and proper&#xD;
      wrist positioning, and instructing the individual not to move or talk if accurate blood&#xD;
      pressures are to be obtained. If one performs the automated readings and manual blood&#xD;
      pressure measurements under standardized conditions, the mean values will be quite similar;&#xD;
      however, this possibility has not yet been fully tested.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, there is a need to assess systematically if there is in fact a difference in the&#xD;
      two blood pressure monitoring approaches under controlled conditions. The goal of this study,&#xD;
      then, is to examine our current practice of obtaining manual blood pressure measurement using&#xD;
      a mercury sphygmomanometer compared to an automated wrist-mounted blood pressure device.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A possible implication of this study is if the blood pressure measurements using the&#xD;
      automated blood pressure device are comparable to the measurements obtained using the mercury&#xD;
      sphygmomanometer, than the mercury devices can be replaced by the more environmentally&#xD;
      acceptable automated devices in our clinical research setting.&#xD;
