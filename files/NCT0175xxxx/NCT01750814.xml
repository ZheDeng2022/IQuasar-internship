        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;

             requirements for the study&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects with a history of hypersensitivity, especially anaphylactic reactions to egg,&#xD;
             egg proteins, chicken or components of vaccine such as gentamicin, gelatin, and&#xD;
             arginine&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects with a history of Guillain-Barré syndrome&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects with severe chronic diseases (e.g., cardiovascular diseases without&#xD;
             controllable hypertension, hemoglobinopathy, respiratory, metabolic, and renal&#xD;
             disorders) who are considered by the investigator to be ineligible for the study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects previously treated with anti-coagulant therapy or hemophiliac patients who&#xD;
             may be at risk of severe hemorrhage after an intramuscular injection&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects who have had an acute febrile (at least 38.0°C) episode at some time during&#xD;
             the 72 hours before enrollment&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects who have received a vaccination within 7 days before enrollment or who are&#xD;
             scheduled for another vaccination (excluding the study vaccine) during the study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Immunocompromised subjects with immunodeficiency diseases or those who are receiving&#xD;
             immunosuppressive or immunomodulatory therapy, e.g., azathioprine, cyclosporin,&#xD;
             interferon, granulocyte-colony stimulating factor, tacrolimus, everolimus, sirolimus&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects who have received high-dose corticosteroids in the 3 months before&#xD;
             vaccination or who will be administered a cumulative dose of 700 mg of corticosteroids&#xD;
             during the study. Inhaled, intranasal, and local application of corticosteroids is&#xD;
             permitted, regardless of dosage, and corticosteroids such as prednisolone at a maximum&#xD;
             dose of 15 mg/day are allowed&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects who have been administered immunoglobulins or blood-derived products 3 months&#xD;
             before enrollment or who are scheduled for the administration during the study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects who have received an influenza vaccine within 6 months of enrollment&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A female subject who is pregnant or who is breast-feeding. Subjects of childbearing&#xD;
             potential without an appropriate contraceptive measure within 30 days before&#xD;
             enrollment and who do not agree to use a clinically acceptable method of birth control&#xD;
             during the study (e.g., oral contraceptives, condom, diaphragm or intrauterine device,&#xD;
             or vasectomy of male partner)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects who have participated in any other clinical trials within 30 days of the&#xD;
             administration of the study vaccine&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Individuals with other clinically significant medical or psychological condition who&#xD;
             are considered by the investigator to be ineligible for the study&#xD;
