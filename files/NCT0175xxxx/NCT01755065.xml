      The purpose of this study is to find a more accurate postoperative pain assessment for&#xD;
      teenager patients. This is important because a patient should not have a very strong pain&#xD;
      medication such as morphine if the pain is just mild.&#xD;

      Pain is a sensory and emotional experience, modified by multiple factors, including meaning,&#xD;
      context, previous pain experience, culture, gender, expectation, anxiety, depression, fear,&#xD;
      family and social factors. Hospitalized teenager patients (11-18 years) admitted to surgical&#xD;
      services experience high prevalence of moderate and severe pain.1 The VAS (Visual Analog&#xD;
      Scale, 0 mm &quot;no pain&quot;, to 100 mm,&quot; the worst pain possible &quot;) is used to assess postoperative&#xD;
      pain for teenager patients. The reliability and validity of this scale was proven but&#xD;
      clinical significance of VAS pain score is not clear. 2 There is an increased focus on very&#xD;
      good pain control and is a common practice that patients with moderate or severe pain scores&#xD;
      (numeric rating score, more than 4) to receive opioid pain medication 3, regardless of pain&#xD;
      behavior or health care providers' input , and this can result in various side effects.&#xD;
      Pediatric nurses administer more pain medications to the children who vocalize their pain. 4&#xD;
      Numerous clinical trials of postoperative pain treatment in teenager use only VAS pain scores&#xD;
      to assess the effectiveness of a studied pain medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although the treatment of pain may be a basic human right, that does not mean that all&#xD;
      teenager patients require opioids administration if they report high pain scores. It is our&#xD;
      observation that teenager's pain behavior does not always correlate with the magnitude of&#xD;
      reported pain scores by the patient and different caregivers. Concomitant parental and nurse&#xD;
      observation of teenager's pain behavior can provide additional information about pain&#xD;
      severity. Minimal correlation between VAS pain scores reported by teenager and caregivers&#xD;
      does not mean that pain severity is &quot;unreal&quot;. Perioperative teenager's pain catastrophizing&#xD;
      thoughts about pain, anxiety, and mood level can influence teenager's postoperative pain&#xD;
      scores.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The authors aim is to develop a multi-modal assessment of postoperative pain for the teenager&#xD;
      patient, using VAS pain scores reported by the teenager, nurse, and parent in association&#xD;
      with the teenager's postoperative pain behavior, pain catastrophizing thinking, anxiety, and&#xD;
      mood level. The subjects included in this study will be 206 teenager patients (11-17 years&#xD;
      old) undergoing any laparoscopic surgical procedures. On postoperative day 1, the teenager&#xD;
      will complete the following questionnaires: Visual Analog Scale from teenager (VAS teen),&#xD;
      State-Trait Anxiety Inventory for Children (STAIC S - Anxiety), Pain Catastrophizing Scale&#xD;
      for Children (PCS-C) and Brief Mood Introspection Scale (BMIS). The nurse taking care of the&#xD;
      patient and one parent, preferable the mother, will complete the following questionnaires:&#xD;
      Visual Analog Scale from parent (VAS p), Visual Analog Scale from nurse (VAS n), and&#xD;
      Adolescent Pain Behavior Questionnaire from parent (APBQ-p), Adolescent Pain Behavior&#xD;
      Questionnaire from nurse (APBQ-n). The main goal is to determine if VAS score reported by the&#xD;
      teenager correlates with VAS scores reported by the parent and nurse, and with pain behavior&#xD;
      scores reported by the nurse and family. Expected correlation is minimal (0.23-0.29) to&#xD;
      moderate (0.3-0.49). Our second goal is to determine whether postoperative pain is associated&#xD;
      with psychosocial factors such as teenager catastrophizing attention to pain, anxiety, and&#xD;
      mood level. Expected correlation between postoperative VAS teen and teenager catastrophizing&#xD;
      attention to pain, anxiety, and mood level is moderate (0.3-0.49) to high (&gt;/=0.5).&#xD;
&#xD;
      To our knowledge, this is the first study to investigate all these variables together to&#xD;
      assess postoperative pain for a teenager patient. The findings of this study may influence&#xD;
      the medical decisions regarding administration of pain medication, allow for a safer and more&#xD;
      effective use of opioids in postoperative period and would be very helpful for clinical and&#xD;
      research practice.&#xD;

        The participants will be selected based on medical records review and medical interview on&#xD;
        the day of surgery: we plan to enroll 206 teenager patients (11-17 years old) with&#xD;
        anticipated postoperative pain after any laparoscopic procedure and their parents and&#xD;
        nurses.&#xD;
