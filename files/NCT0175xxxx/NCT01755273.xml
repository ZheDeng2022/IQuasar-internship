  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pancreaticoduodenectomy (PD) includes en bloc resection of duodenum, head of pancreas,&#xD;
      proximal jejunum, distal common bile duct (CBD), gallbladder, and distal stomach, which was&#xD;
      followed by complicated reconstructions. Therefore, PD causes change of physiological&#xD;
      functions, containing insufficiency of exocrine and endocrine pancreatic function,&#xD;
      malabsorption of nutrients, impairment of gut peristalsis, and hepatic steatosis . On the&#xD;
      other hand, DM may also resolve after PD in cases with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma. From&#xD;
      the study of bariatric operation, resolution of DM may occur even before body weight loss.&#xD;
      Postulated mechanism of resolution of DM after bariatric operation included foregut and hind&#xD;
      gut theory. Actually, both hindgut and foregut effects on sugar control are achieved to some&#xD;
      extent after pancreaticoduodenectomy. First, most of the duodenum is routinely removed in PD&#xD;
      and there will be no food passage through duodenum (foregut theory) after PD. Second,&#xD;
      proximal 10 cm of jejunum will be removed in PD and another 30~ 40 cm- long jejunum will be&#xD;
      brought up for pancreatic and biliary anastomosis, which will make the last enteral&#xD;
      anastomosis (gastrojejunostomy or duodenojejunostomy) be created at site about 50-60 cm&#xD;
      distal to Treitz ligament. Therefore, food will directly pass into distal jejunum (hindgut&#xD;
      theory). In our preliminary study, 35% patients have resolution of diabetes after PD,&#xD;
      especially for ones with new-onset DM. Further, a prospective randomized clinical trial will&#xD;
      be conducted to address if modified distal gastro-/duodeno-jejunostomy results in a higher&#xD;
      proportion of diabetes remission compared with standard PD.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All new-onset DM patients undergoing PD will be considered for inclusion in this prospective&#xD;
      randomized study. Inclusion criteria will be age greater than 20 years and planned PD for a&#xD;
      lesion of either the pancreatic head or the periampullary region. The patients received&#xD;
      standard PD are defined as control group; the cases receiving more distal&#xD;
      gastro-/duodeno-jejunostomy ( 60 cm distal to gastro-/duodeno-jejunostomy on the control&#xD;
      group) are defined as study group . The trial will be conducted only after obtaining an&#xD;
      approval for the study design from the National Taiwan University institutional ethics review&#xD;
      board. The type of surgery (pylorus-preserving or standard PD) and the type of management of&#xD;
      the pancreatic stump (pancreaticojejunostomy or pancreaticogastrostomy) will be left to the&#xD;
      surgeons' discretion. This trial will be done for two years to investigate if distal enteral&#xD;
      bypass results in more remission of diabetes in new-onset DM cases after PD .After PD, FBG&#xD;
      and HbA1c were routinely checked every 3 months for two years. The definition of remission of&#xD;
      DM was that a fasting glucose level &lt; 110 mg/dL and HbA1c &lt; 6.0% without the use of oral&#xD;
      hypoglycemic agents or insulin was defined as complete remission. A fasting glucose value &lt;&#xD;
      126 mg/dL and HbA1c &lt;6.5% was defined partial remission.32 In addition, the body weight will&#xD;
      be checked regularly. The demographic, pathological, and clinical data will be recorded. The&#xD;
      preoperative and postoperative antidiabetic medication and doses were also included.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In plan (to study if more distal bypass of gastrojejunostomy may increase remission of&#xD;
      new-onset DM cases), the major concern of potential risk for patients participating the&#xD;
      clinical trial is malnutrition due to enteral bypass. Other surgical procedures are the same&#xD;
      as standard PD. For the monitoring of malnutrition, patients visited outpatient clinic every&#xD;
      month for the first six months, and every three months afterward. The complete blood count&#xD;
      and value of serum albumin will be checked very three months. The body weight loss &gt; 10%&#xD;
      during three months is considered malnutrition. The peripheral parenteral nutrition will be&#xD;
      administered to manage the malnutrition, and total parenteral nutrition should be used if&#xD;
      malnutrition persisted. However, malnutrition is also a common phenomenon for recurrent&#xD;
      cancer cases. The management of malnutrition for cancer patients will be managed according to&#xD;
      clinical guidelines at National Taiwan University Hospital.&#xD;
