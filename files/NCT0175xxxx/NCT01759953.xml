  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: Physicians´ lack of knowledge contributes to underuse of insulin and poor&#xD;
      glycemic control in adults with diabetes mellitus (DM). Traditional continuing medical&#xD;
      education have limited efficacy, so new approaches are required.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: We report the design of a trial to assess the educational efficacy of InsuOnline©,&#xD;
      a game for education of primary care physicians (PCPs) on initiation and adjustment of&#xD;
      insulin for the treatment of DM, which was designed to be: a) educationally adequate; and b)&#xD;
      self-motivating and attractive.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: A multidisciplinary team, with endocrinologists, experts in medical education, and&#xD;
      programmers, was assembled for design and development of InsuOnline©, a serious game which&#xD;
      includes game elements and a well-defined, evidence-based curriculum of topics on insulin&#xD;
      therapy. The first step of our study will be usability and playability tests, with PCPs and&#xD;
      medical students, playing the game on a desktop. After that and further adjusts, we will&#xD;
      perform an unblinded randomized controlled trial, with PCPs who work in the city of Londrina,&#xD;
      to assess the educational validity of the game. A group of 64 PCPs will play InsuOnline© on&#xD;
      the web, and the control group, of 64 PCPs, will underwent traditional teaching activities&#xD;
      (lecture and group discussion). Knowledge on how to initiate and adjust insulin will be&#xD;
      assessed by a web-based multiple-choice questionnaire, and attitudes regarding&#xD;
      diabetes/insulin will be assessed by Diabetes Attitude Scale 3, at 3 time points: before,&#xD;
      immediately after, and 6 months after the intervention. Subjects´ general impressions on the&#xD;
      interventions will also be assessed by free-text questions. Software logs will be reviewed.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Achieving and maintaining good glycemic control is the mainstay of treatment of diabetes&#xD;
      mellitus (DM). Unfortunately, only 24% to 56% of patients with DM are within the goal of A1c&#xD;
      &lt;7%, in most countries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Worldwide, according with public health trends, most diabetics are treated by primary care&#xD;
      physicians (PCPs), but these professionals lack knowledge and confidence on several aspects&#xD;
      of DM management, specially regarding insulin use. This contributes to the common problem&#xD;
      known as clinical inertia (&quot;the failure to advance therapy when indicated&quot;), underuse of&#xD;
      insulin, and poor glycemic control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Continuing medical education (CME) on DM and insulin is often advocated as a solution to&#xD;
      optimize the knowledge and the practice of PCPs; however, traditional CME activities (such as&#xD;
      lectures and group discussions) have small and short-lasting efficacy. Thus, new educational&#xD;
      methods are urgently required.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives: To describe the design of a randomized controlled trial to assess if InsuOnline©,&#xD;
      a PC serious game for teaching PCPs about initiation and adjustment of insulin in the&#xD;
      treatment of DM, can be educationally effective.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      Game Design A multidisciplinary team was assembled: clinical endocrinologists (LAD, RZE),&#xD;
      experts in medical education (PAG, MLSGJ, ICMC) and software developers/game designers (JBA,&#xD;
      RMS). The endocrinologists compiled a list of main topics (the &quot;minimum curriculum&quot; of the&#xD;
      game) on insulin initiation and adjustment, for treatment of adults with DM, in the context&#xD;
      of a primary health care setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Periodic team meetings were scheduled during the design and development phases, to review&#xD;
      each step, correct problems, and make decisions for the following stages, in an iterative&#xD;
      process. The group agreed that the game should be developed in a way to satisfy 2 basic&#xD;
      conditions: a) to be educationally adequate; and b) to be self-motivating and attractive to&#xD;
      the final users.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Level Design Sixteen diabetic patients were created, reflecting common clinical scenarios in&#xD;
      actual primary health care clinical practice, each one corresponding to at least one of the&#xD;
      topics of game´s minimum curriculum. Each patient is a game level. The patients/levels are&#xD;
      disposed in an increasing complexity order. The player´s avatar must take decisions on which&#xD;
      is the best therapeutic option to improve each patient´s glycemic control. Right decisions&#xD;
      lead to progression to the next level.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interaction Ways and Game Elements Players´ interaction with the game is made via mouse.&#xD;
      Several ways of interaction and game elements were included along the game, to make it a&#xD;
      pleasant experience and to maximize players´ intrinsic motivation. The player can read&#xD;
      patients´s clinical charts, dialogue with them (choosing among a few options of &quot;talks&quot;), see&#xD;
      their lab tests or fingertip glucose readings, review their physical exam, answer to &quot;quiz&#xD;
      challenges&quot;, solve puzzles, get &quot;tips&quot; from the mentor and from a nurse, and, finally,&#xD;
      prescribe insulin. Sound track, score, visual and sound effects, patients' &quot;mood&quot; (the&#xD;
      patient gets angry if the player makes too many errors), and between-levels animation scenes&#xD;
      (&quot;machinimas&quot;) were also included, to improve gaming experience and players´ motivation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pedagogical Elements Several pedagogical elements were included in the game, aiming for the&#xD;
      best educational effects, based on principles of Adult Learning and Problem-Based Learning:&#xD;
      motivation, goal-orientation, relevancy-orientation, self-pacing, timely and appropriate&#xD;
      feedback, reinforcement of learning, informal environment, contextualisation, and practical&#xD;
      (&quot;hands-on&quot;) approach with active participation of the learner.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The game gives immediate feedback (given by the character of the &quot;mentor&quot;), comparing&#xD;
      player's decisions with recommendations from clinical guidelines. Correct decisions lead to&#xD;
      gaining points and progression in the game. At every step, the game offers additional&#xD;
      learning resources: PDF-format help files (algorithms, summaries, clinical pearls),&#xD;
      orientation from a &quot;mentor&quot; character, and links to bibliographic references. If the player&#xD;
      fails to make the right choices, he can try the same level again.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Usability and Playability Evaluation The next step will be usability and playability&#xD;
      assessment. For this, we will enroll 4 physicians who work in the city of Londrina (2 female&#xD;
      and 2 male; 2 with gaming/computer previous experience and 2 without experience) and 4&#xD;
      undergraduate medical students from UEL (2 female and 2 male, with and without gaming&#xD;
      experience), whom will play the game on a desktop, in a controlled environment (lab for&#xD;
      usability tests), each participant alone in a single session. Usability data will be assessed&#xD;
      using web-based System Usability Scale (SUS), as previously described by Brooke, and&#xD;
      playability will be assessed by web-based Heuristic Evaluation for Playability (HEP), as&#xD;
      described by Desurvire et al. The actions of the players will be recorded by the software for&#xD;
      further analysis by the researchers (LAD, RMS). Further adjustments will be made in the game,&#xD;
      according to responses obtained in this phase of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Educational Efficacy Assessment After final adjustments in the game, guided by usability and&#xD;
      playability assessments, the efficacy of InsuOnline© as an educational tool will be assessed&#xD;
      in an unblinded randomized controlled trial. We will send a letter of invitation to all&#xD;
      primary care physicians (PCPs) who work in the city of Londrina to participate in the study;&#xD;
      if those PCPs do not fulfill our sample size, we will also invite PCPs from other cities of&#xD;
      the state of Paraná (Brazil), such as Maringá, Curitiba, or São José dos Pinhais. The PCPs&#xD;
      which are willing to participate in the study will be included and randomized at study entry,&#xD;
      using a random number generator, to one of 2 groups. We will exclude clinical&#xD;
      endocrinologists or diabetologists.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physicians enrolled in the Group A will be exposed to InsuOnline©. They will be asked to play&#xD;
      the game until its end, on the web (with an individual login), in their own time and rhythm.&#xD;
      Physicians enrolled in the Group B will undertake a traditional (in-class) learning session,&#xD;
      during one afternoon, composed by a short lecture and a group discussion of clinical cases&#xD;
      which will be identical to the ones included in InsuOnline©. This traditional learning&#xD;
      session will focus on the same teaching topics of the game, and it will be coordinated by a&#xD;
      clinical endocrinologist not linked to the research team, in order to avoid potential biases.&#xD;
      This endocrinologist will be previously trained by the researcher endocrinologists, and he&#xD;
      will use didactic material prepared by our team.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will evaluate subjects´ knowledge on insulin therapy using a web-based questionnaire,&#xD;
      containing 10 to 20 multiple-choice questions. The questions will be clinical vignettes of&#xD;
      diabetic patients who require initiation and/or adjustment of insulin; for each, the&#xD;
      participant should choose the best option for achieving a better glycemic control, according&#xD;
      to current guidelines. Questions regarding insulin therapy will be chosen from the American&#xD;
      Diabetes Association Self-Assessment Program, Module 2 (Pharmacological Treatment of&#xD;
      Hyperglycemia), translated to Portuguese, and adapted to be compatible with the game´s&#xD;
      clinical scenarios and learning objectives. Participants´ attitudes regarding diabetes will&#xD;
      also be assessed, by the application of web-based Diabetes Attitudes Scale, version 3&#xD;
      (DAS-3). The questionnaire and the DAS-3 will be answered by the participants in 3 time&#xD;
      points: before the intervention (pre-test), immediately after the intervention (after-test),&#xD;
      and 6 months after the intervention (late-test). The average of right answers will be&#xD;
      presented and compared: a) in the different time points, within each group (intragroup),&#xD;
      using analysis of variance (ANOVA); and b) between the two groups, at each time point&#xD;
      (intergroup), using Student´s t test. A bicaudal significance level of 0.05 will be adopted.&#xD;
      Data analysis will be done by intention-to-treat, with last observation carried forward,&#xD;
      which means that all randomized participants´ data will be included in the final analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A few Likert-scale and free-text questions will also be asked to the participants at the end&#xD;
      of each intervention, in order to assess their general impressions about the intervention&#xD;
      (mostly to assess if it was pleasant or enjoyable). Software-recorded data on player´s usage&#xD;
      of the game will be analyzed to assess: number of logins, time spent on the game, etc. For&#xD;
      the participants in Group A who does not finish the game, the reasons for early withdrawal&#xD;
      will be collected by an online questionnaire. We will contact (by phone or e-mail) at least&#xD;
      twice the participants who eventually do not fulfill the questionnaires.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to detect a minimum difference of 0.5 standard deviation on the average of right&#xD;
      answers, with 80% of statistical power, at 5% of significance level, we will need to include&#xD;
      128 subjects in our study (64 in each group). We will enroll 160 subjects (80 in each group),&#xD;
      in order to compensate for an expected 25% dropout rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethical Considerations Participation will be anonymous and voluntary, and all subjects will&#xD;
      previously provide written informed consent, according to Brazilian Health Ministry´s&#xD;
      regulations (see the informed consent form in the Appendix). The study protocol was approved&#xD;
      by our local Research Ethics Committee (UEL, #051/2011 and #051/2012), and registered by UEL&#xD;
      research board (Research Project #07471).&#xD;
