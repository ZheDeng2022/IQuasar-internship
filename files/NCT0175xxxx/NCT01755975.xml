  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The treatments used to treat lymphoma and multiple myeloma sometimes do not always work well&#xD;
      or they may only work for a short period of time. This is why new treatments are being&#xD;
      tested.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will test a new combination of two drugs that are already approved by the Food and&#xD;
      Drug Administration for treatment of certain kinds of blood cancers. These drugs are&#xD;
      romidepsin and lenalidomide. Both these drugs by themselves have been used to treat lymphoma&#xD;
      or multiple myeloma. However, while these drugs are routinely used alone, this is the first&#xD;
      time they will be tested together. The mechanism of action of both drugs is not well&#xD;
      understood but both have been shown to to be effective by themselves in lymphoma and multiple&#xD;
      myeloma.&#xD;
