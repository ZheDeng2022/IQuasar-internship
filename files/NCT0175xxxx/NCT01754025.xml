  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Lung cancer is a common malignancy that is associated with cigarette smoking but can also&#xD;
      affect individuals who never smoked. It is not well understood whether there are hereditary&#xD;
      risk factors that influence the risk of lung cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It has been recently found that a small number of families have an inherited (passed from&#xD;
      parent to child) change in one of their genes that may contribute to an increased tendency to&#xD;
      develop lung cancers, even in never smokers. In some lung cancer patients this gene, called&#xD;
      &quot;EGFR&quot;, contains a DNA change known as an &quot;inherited EGFR mutation&quot;. Early data indicate that&#xD;
      these inherited EGFR mutations may be associated with an increased risk of lung cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      So far, only a small number of families have been found to carry inherited EGFR mutations.&#xD;
      For this reason the risk of lung cancer associated with inherited EGFR mutations is not well&#xD;
      understood. Understanding the risk may help investigators find ways of detecting lung cancer&#xD;
      sooner or reducing the risk of developing lung cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It was recently discovered that lung cancer patients who are found to carry one rare EGFR&#xD;
      mutation in their cancer cells, called &quot;T790M&quot;, have an increased risk of carrying an&#xD;
      inherited EGFR mutation in their normal cells as well. This represents a new strategy for&#xD;
      finding individuals and families carrying inherited EGFR mutations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This research study is designed to find cancer patients whose tumors have this EGFR mutation,&#xD;
      T790M, to find out if they also have an inherited EGFR mutation. Subjects will not have to&#xD;
      undergo a biopsy to participate in this research study. Investigators will collect a saliva&#xD;
      specimen from patients with a T790M in their cancer to find out if they also have an&#xD;
      inherited EGFR mutation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study participants found or known to carry an inherited EGFR mutation will have the option of&#xD;
      offering their close relative the opportunity to also participate in this study. Close&#xD;
      relatives can consider testing to see if they also carry the inherited mutation in their&#xD;
      normal cells. Once investigators have identified individuals and relatives that carry&#xD;
      inherited EGFR mutations in their genes, investigators will then try to understand the risk&#xD;
      of lung cancer and other cancers. Individuals with inherited EGFR mutations will also have&#xD;
      the opportunity to participate in future studies related to cancer and other diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is being funded in part by the Conquer Cancer Foundation of ASCO and the Bonnie J.&#xD;
      Addario Lung Cancer Foundation.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      If a subject have lung cancer or another cancer carrying a T790M mutation in the EGFR gene,&#xD;
      he/she may be eligible to participate in this research study. To determine eligibility, a&#xD;
      subject will need to perform the following steps: provide informed consent, fill out the&#xD;
      study questionnaire and provide medical records documentation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study questionnaire should take about 30 minutes to complete. The questionnaire asks for&#xD;
      information on personal and family cancer and health history. The information provided will&#xD;
      help investigators to determine which parts of the study a subject is eligible for. A few&#xD;
      weeks after submitting the questionnaire, a member of the research study team will contact&#xD;
      the subject by telephone to clarify any questions about the response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For medical records documentation investigators will request permission to obtain and review&#xD;
      medical records pertaining to any personal history of cancer. Subjects will need to complete&#xD;
      a medical record release form to allow investigators to collect medical records regarding&#xD;
      prior cancers and cancer treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After a subject is determined to be eligible, he/she will have a conversation with a genetic&#xD;
      counselor regarding the potential risks, benefits and limitations of genetic testing. A&#xD;
      genetic counselor is an expert in the field of inherited disorders. They work as members of&#xD;
      the health care team and act as a patient advocate providing education and support to the&#xD;
      patient, family and the medical team. If a subject agrees to proceed, he/she will be provided&#xD;
      a kit (by mail or in person) to provide a saliva sample for genetic testing. This involves&#xD;
      spitting into a special container provided by the study. This sample will be sent to a&#xD;
      clinically-certified testing laboratory to determine presence of an inherited EGFR mutation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once the results have been determined, the subject will receive a letter with the phone&#xD;
      number of a genetic counselor to call in order to review results of the genetic testing.&#xD;
      Alternatively, a subject can decide not to receive the results of the genetic testing and can&#xD;
      note that on the letter received and send it back to the study team instead of calling for&#xD;
      the results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If a mutation is found in the saliva sample, a subject will receive information about how to&#xD;
      undergo confirmatory testing of a blood specimen. This can be done at a local laboratory&#xD;
      using a kit that will be mailed. When the results are available a genetic counselor will call&#xD;
      to discuss them. If the confirmatory blood test confirms an inherited mutation, subjects will&#xD;
      receive instructions on how to invite family members to be tested if appropriate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators will collect material from a prior tumor biopsy (if available), copies of&#xD;
      imaging scans, and medical records to study. The copies of imaging scans will allow study of&#xD;
      the characteristics of nodules in the lungs. This information will be used to answer&#xD;
      additional questions about cancers carrying EGFR T790M mutations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It will only take a few months to complete the main part of the study. After that, subjects&#xD;
      will be followed every 6 months for 2 years. If a subject allows a piece of a tumor specimen&#xD;
      or DNA to be stored for future investigational studies, then he/she will remain enrolled in&#xD;
      research for as long as the specimen is stored in the specimen bank.&#xD;
