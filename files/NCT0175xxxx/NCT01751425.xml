    <textblock>
      This phase I/II trial studies the side effects and best dose of ruxolitinib and to see how&#xD;
      well it works in participants with chronic myeloid leukemia with minimal residual disease&#xD;
      while on therapy with tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Ruxolitinib may stop the growth of cancer&#xD;
      cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the dose limiting toxicity (DLT) and maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of the&#xD;
      combination of ruxolitinib and a tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) in patients with chronic&#xD;
      myeloid leukemia (CML). (Phase I) II. To determine the clinical activity of the combination&#xD;
      of ruxolitinib and a TKI in patients with CML in complete cytogenetic remission (CCyR) with&#xD;
      minimal residual disease (MRD). (Phase II)&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the clinical activity of the combination of ruxolitinib and a TKI in patients&#xD;
      with CML. (Phase I) II. To determine the safety of the combination of ruxolitinib and a TKI&#xD;
      in patients with CML in CCyR with minimal residual disease. (Phase II) III. Determine the&#xD;
      overall survival, event-free survival and survival free from transformation to accelerated&#xD;
      and blast phase. (Phase I and II) IV. Determine the effect of therapy on bone marrow&#xD;
      progenitors in clonogenic assays. (Phase I and II) V. Investigate the effect of therapy on&#xD;
      molecular responses as assessed by genomic deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) polymerase chain&#xD;
      reaction (PCR). (Phase I and II) VI. Determine the effect of therapy on TKI-resistant&#xD;
      quiescent leukemic Philadelphia chromosome (Ph)+ stem cells (CFSEmax/CD34+) by flow&#xD;
      cytometric evaluation of activated Crkl and Jak2. (Phase I and II) VII. Assess the effect of&#xD;
      therapy on self-renewal and/or survival of leukemic stem cells by fluorescence in situ&#xD;
      hybridization (FISH) analysis on colonies. (Phase I and II) VIII. Assess ruxolitinib&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics (PK) in preselected time intervals during co-administration of this agent&#xD;
      with TKIs. (Phase I and II)&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose-escalation study of ruxolitinib followed by a phase II&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants receive commercially available TKIs (imatinib mesylate, nilotinib, or dasatinib)&#xD;
      as they had been receiving during the last 6 months and ruxolitinib orally (PO) twice daily&#xD;
      (BID). Courses repeat every 28 days for 2 years in the absence of disease progression or&#xD;
      unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, participants are followed up for 30 days.&#xD;

             transcript levels have shown in at least 2 consecutive measures separated by at least&#xD;
             1 month to have increased by any value; or achieved a major molecular response which&#xD;
             has been lost, with an interim increase in transcript levels by at least one-log,&#xD;
             confirmed in two consecutive analyses separated by at least 1 month; or patient has&#xD;
             received therapy for at least 2 years &amp; lacks a sustained major molecular response; or&#xD;
             patient has received therapy for at least 5 years and lacks a sustained complete&#xD;
             molecular response (CMR, defined as transcript levels still detectable in the MDACC&#xD;
             molecular diagnostic laboratory).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must not have had a known interruption of TKI therapy of greater than 21&#xD;
             consecutive days or for a total of 6 weeks in the 6 months prior to enrollment.&#xD;
