      The objectives of this study are to determine the safety, tolerability and preliminary&#xD;
      efficacy of alemtuzumab for infusion for the treatment of CIDP. Eligible subjects will be&#xD;
      treated with alemtuzumab at the beginning of the study and then followed for three years.&#xD;
      During the three year period, subjects will under go monthly safety evaluations consisting of&#xD;
      blood and urine testing, symptom surveys and examination. Detailed neurological testing&#xD;
      including nerve conduction testing, Rasch-built Overall Disability Scale (CIDP/RODS) and&#xD;
      Overall Neuropathy Limitations Scale (ONLS) assessments will be performed every six months&#xD;
      for three years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will also investigate and compare the responsiveness of the outcome measures being&#xD;
      used.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This is an open-label multi-center trial of alemtuzumab in the treatment of Chronic&#xD;
      Inflammatory Demyelinating Polyradiculoneuropathy (CIDP). The study will have 4 phases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Approximately 16 eligible participants will receive at least one cycle of alemtuzumab (5 days&#xD;
      of drug infusion). Additional cycles of alemtuzumab (3 days of drug infusion) may be provided&#xD;
      at the discretion of the participants' treating physician such as if clinical worsening&#xD;
      occurs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 1: Screening Participants meeting the inclusion and exclusion criteria and having&#xD;
      signed the informed consent document will enter the screening phase and undergo baseline&#xD;
      evaluations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 2: Drug Infusion Participants will receive alemtuzumab by infusion using a standardized&#xD;
      protocol. Participants will be maintained on their prior CIDP therapy during the drug&#xD;
      infusions and then followed at regular intervals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 3. Alteration of CIDP therapy CIDP therapy may be altered at the discretion of the&#xD;
      treating physician - either taper, discontinuation, or increase of current or additional&#xD;
      medications. For those participants on chronic corticosteroid therapy, following pulse IV&#xD;
      methylprednisolone and alemtuzumab cycle, corticosteroids will be tapered as rapidly and as&#xD;
      far as possible according to according to the investigator's discretion. While the aim will&#xD;
      be to discontinue corticosteroids, it is recognized that some participants will have a&#xD;
      suppressed pituitary-adrenal axis and complete discontinuation may not be possible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 4: Extended Follow-up Each participant will be followed per protocol for a minimum of&#xD;
      36 months. All participants will undergo safety assessments and monitoring for at least 36&#xD;
      months after the last cycle of alemtuzumab. Additional cycles of alemtuzumab may be provided&#xD;
      at the discretion of the participants' treating physician with at least a 12 month interval&#xD;
      between cycles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      NUMBER OF PARTICIPANTS: Approximately 16 participants will join this study.&#xD;

             months.&#xD;

             biological and pharmacokinetic properties of the investigational drug (prior treatment&#xD;
             with herbal medications or nutritional supplements is permitted).&#xD;
&#xD;

             catheter, dysphagia, decubitus ulcer, history of prior aspiration pneumonia or&#xD;
             recurrent urinary tract infection).&#xD;

             participant may be eligible after the condition has resolved (e.g., follow-up HPV&#xD;
             (human papilloma virus) test is negative or cervical abnormality has been effectively&#xD;
             treated).&#xD;
