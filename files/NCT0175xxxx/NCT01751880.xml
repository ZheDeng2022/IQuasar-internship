  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Gastric cancer is a major health issue and one of the most common malignance in Korea. With&#xD;
      the popularization of cancer screenings and increasing the average lifespan, the number of&#xD;
      gastric cancer patients is increased. In the past, most of the research were concerned with&#xD;
      survival and recovery after cancer surgery. However, as the medical technology had been&#xD;
      developed and recovery rate and survival rate of cancer patients had risen, the patients&#xD;
      wanted to return to a daily life and desire for participation for leisure. In other words,&#xD;
      the patients who underwent surgery wants to maintain a high quality of life(QOL) level as&#xD;
      like prior to cancer surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are many reports on the effect of the exercise program after cancer surgery. In&#xD;
      addition, exercise program was associated with improving the QOL and functional recovery,&#xD;
      decreasing a mood of depression, maintaining a muscle mass and improving the survival rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, the subject patients of previous studies were Western people. Therefore, The results&#xD;
      were not disclosed whether the exercise program suited to the body characteristics of Korean&#xD;
      people. Furthermore there was no exercise program studies for the gastric cancer patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Medical service for cancer patients care should include not only diagnosis, treatment as like&#xD;
      surgery but efforts on enhancing the quality of life. In other words, post-management&#xD;
      education and management program as like exercise program are necessary for the cancer&#xD;
      patients after surgery. So, the research about how to practice the exercise program and how&#xD;
      to evaluate the effect on the recovery is needed.&#xD;

    <description>Exercise program is scheduled to be conducted in three phases. Phase I is in-hospital exercise program. This program will be conducted in hospital during 1 week after surgery. Phase II is home-exercise program that will be performed at home during 1 week after discharge. Phase III is main-exercise program that will be conducted the fitness center nearby hospital during 8 weeks after phase II program. Main-exercise program is focused on the functional recovery.</description>
