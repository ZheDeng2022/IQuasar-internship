  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether Eltrombopag may shorten time to platelet&#xD;
      engraftment after allogeneic cord blood transplantation.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Platelet recovery is significantly hampered following umbilical cord blood (UCB)&#xD;
      transplantation. Median time to platelet engraftment (defined as the first of 7 consecutive&#xD;
      days of an unsupported platelet count of at least 20,000/microliter) in a large retrospective&#xD;
      study was more than 70 days and cumulative incidence of platelet recovery at 6 months was&#xD;
      50.5%. In the pediatric population with acute leukemia median time to platelet engraftment&#xD;
      with UCB transplantation was 59 days and cumulative incidence of platelet recovery at 6&#xD;
      months was 43%-73%, depending on human leukocyte antigen (HLA) disparity and cell dose.&#xD;
      Recently, in a cohort of adult patients given myeloablative conditioning followed by double&#xD;
      UCB transplantation, the cumulative incidence of platelet recovery (≥ 50,000/microliter)at&#xD;
      100 days was 53%. In another cohort of patients given reduced intensity conditioning regimen&#xD;
      followed by single or double UCB transplantation, the median time to platelet recovery (≥&#xD;
      50,000/microliter) and cumulative incidence of platelet recovery at 6 months were 49 days and&#xD;
      65%, respectively. Thus, after UCB transplantations, patients are platelet&#xD;
      transfusion-dependent for prolong periods of time, resulting in many drawbacks, such as&#xD;
      exposure to blood transfusions hazards, higher incidence of platelet allo-reactivity and&#xD;
      extended periods of bleeding diathesis and undesirable costly and long hospitalizations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eltrombopag is a thrombopoietin-receptor agonist that initiates thrombopoietin-receptor&#xD;
      signaling and thereby inducing proliferation and maturation of megakaryocytes.Administration&#xD;
      of eltrombopag increased platelet production in volunteers with normal platelet counts,&#xD;
      patients with thrombocytopenia secondary to hepatitis C virus infection and in patients with&#xD;
      chronic immune thrombocytopenic purpura.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will evaluate the safety and efficacy of eltrombopag treatment given early after UCB&#xD;
      transplantation. The study is an open non-comparative study. The primary outcome will be&#xD;
      cumulative incidence of partial platelet engraftment (first of 7 consecutive days of an&#xD;
      unsupported platelet count of at least 20,000/microliter)at day 50 post transplantation.&#xD;
      Secondary objectives are safety, tolerability and other transplantation related outcomes.&#xD;

    <description>Eltrombopag will be given orally as a single daily dose. From day +1 after cord blood transplantation, start eltrombopag 100 mg/d. If primary end point not reached on day +14,then from day +15 - 150 mg/d. If primary end point not reached on day +28 then from day +29 - 200 mg/d. If primary end point not reached on day +42 then from day +43 and on - 300 mg/d (maximal dose). If dose not tolerated, return to last tolerated dose.&#xD;
Eltrombopag will be discontinued after platelet count has exceeded 50,000/microliter for 14 consecutive days without administration of platelets.&#xD;
In case of decline of platelet count &lt; 30,000/microliter within 15 days from eltrombopag discontinuation, it will be resumed for additional 4 weeks.&#xD;
After 4 weeks we will re-attempt to hold the drug.</description>
