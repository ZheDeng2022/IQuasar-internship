      This study will examine dose ranging characteristics of bepotastine besilate nasal spray&#xD;
      compared to placebo nasal spray in 600 male or female subjects 12 years of age and older with&#xD;
      active seasonal allergic rhinitis (SAR) and a demonstrated history of allergic sensitivity to&#xD;
      Mountain Cedar pollen for at least 2 years prior to the study.&#xD;

    <description>Total nasal symptom score (TNSS) was the summed scores for nasal pruritus [itching], rhinorrhea [runny nose], nasal congestion, and sneezing. Individual nasal symptoms were each rated on a 4-point scale from 0-3 (0=Absent, 1=Mild, 2=Moderate, 3=Severe), with no half-unit assessments. TNSS was the sum score of 4 nasal symptoms with a minimum score of 0 units and a maximum score of 12 units, with higher score corresponding to increased nasal allergy symptoms. Morning and evening scores were averaged.</description>

        <title>Mean Change From Baseline (Pre-Dose) Twice Daily Averaged Subject-rated Reflective Total Nasal Symptom Score (TNSS)</title>
        <description>Total nasal symptom score (TNSS) was the summed scores for nasal pruritus [itching], rhinorrhea [runny nose], nasal congestion, and sneezing. Individual nasal symptoms were each rated on a 4-point scale from 0-3 (0=Absent, 1=Mild, 2=Moderate, 3=Severe), with no half-unit assessments. TNSS was the sum score of 4 nasal symptoms with a minimum score of 0 units and a maximum score of 12 units, with higher score corresponding to increased nasal allergy symptoms.
