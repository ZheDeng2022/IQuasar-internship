        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. All patients with diagnosis of aHUS who have been receiving eculizumab by personal&#xD;
             importation (specific eligibility criteria below do not apply) Or,&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Patients with current clinical manifestations of aHUS who meet the following criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Patient with diagnosis of aHUS with or without an identified complement&#xD;
                  regulatory protein genetic abnormality or anti-complement factor antibody and for&#xD;
                  whom other known etiologies of hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) have been ruled&#xD;
                  out as confirmed in the Exclusion Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Patient (and legal guardian if patient is not an adult) willing and able to give&#xD;

&#xD;
               3. Patient at least 1 month of age and body weight ≥5 kg&#xD;
&#xD;
               4. Platelet count at screening &lt; lower limit of normal (LLN)&#xD;
&#xD;
               5. Signs or symptoms of hemolysis (i.e., lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) ≥ 1.5x upper&#xD;
                  limit of normal (ULN) and Hemoglobin ≤ LLN) at start of current aHUS event&#xD;
&#xD;
               6. Serum Creatinine (SrCr) level ≥ ULN at screening (patient requiring dialysis for&#xD;
                  acute renal failure also eligible)&#xD;
&#xD;
               7. Female patient of childbearing potential practicing an effective, reliable and&#xD;
                  medically approved contraceptive regimen during the entire duration of the study,&#xD;
                  including the Follow-up Period. At the time of the last follow-up visit, patient&#xD;
                  must agree to continue to use adequate contraception methods for up to 5 months&#xD;
                  following discontinuation of eculizumab treatment&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;

        malignancy within 5 years of screening Known human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection&#xD;
        Identified drug exposure-related HUS Infection-related HUS HUS related to bone marrow&#xD;
        transplant (BMT) HUS related to vitamin B12 deficiency Known Systemic Lupus Erythematosus&#xD;
        (SLE) or antiphospholipid antibody positivity or syndrome Chronic dialysis (defined as&#xD;
        dialysis on a regular basis as renal replacement therapy for end-stage renal disease&#xD;
        (ESRD)) Patients with a confirmed diagnosis of sepsis defined as positive blood cultures&#xD;
        within 7 days of the screening visit and not treated with antibiotics to which the organism&#xD;
        is sensitive Presence or suspicion of active and untreated systemic bacterial infection&#xD;
        that, in the opinion of the Investigator confounds an accurate diagnosis of aHUS or impedes&#xD;
        the ability to manage the aHUS disease Pregnancy or lactation Unresolved systemic&#xD;
        meningococcal disease Any medical or psychological condition that, in the opinion of the&#xD;
        investigator, could increase patient's risk by participating in the study or confound the&#xD;
        outcome of the study Patients receiving chronic intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) within 8&#xD;
        weeks unless for unrelated medical condition (e.g., hypogammaglobulinemia) or chronic&#xD;
        rituximab therapy within 12 weeks of the screening visit Patients receiving other&#xD;
        immunosuppressive therapies such as steroids, calcineurin inhibitors (mTOR), (e.g.,&#xD;
        cyclosporine or tacrolimus) are excluded unless: [1] part of an established post-transplant&#xD;
        anti-rejection regimen, or [2] patient has confirmed anti-Complement Factor Antibodies&#xD;
        requiring immunosuppressive therapy or [3] steroids are used for a condition other than&#xD;
        aHUS (e.g., asthma) Prior eculizumab use, hypersensitivity to eculizumab, to murine&#xD;
        proteins or to one of the excipients Inclusion in any other investigational intervention&#xD;
        trial except this study&#xD;
