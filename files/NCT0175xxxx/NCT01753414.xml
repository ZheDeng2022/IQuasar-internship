  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Rationale: Surgery remains the standard of care for stage 1 (T1-2a N0)non-small cell lung&#xD;
      cancer. Stereotactic body radiation therapy is a newer radiation treatment that gives fewer&#xD;
      but higher and possibly more effective doses of radiation than standard radiation. This&#xD;
      technique may be able to send x-rays directly to the tumor and cause less damage to normal&#xD;
      tissue. It is not yet known whether stereotactic body radiation therapy is more effective&#xD;
      than surgery in treating non-small cell lung cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Purpose: The primary aim of this randomized phase II trial is to determine if the efficacy of&#xD;
      SBRT is comparable to that of standard surgical interventions for patients with T1N0&#xD;
      non-small cell lung cancer.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        - Pathologically (histologically or cytologically) proven diagnosis of Stage I NSCLC (AJCC,&#xD;
        7th ed.), T1N0M0; note: T1N0 disease must be confirmed by FDG-PET/CT&#xD;
&#xD;
        The following primary cancer types are eligible: squamous cell carcinoma; adenocarcinoma;&#xD;
        large cell carcinoma/ large cell neuroendocrine carcinoma; non-small cell carcinoma not&#xD;
        otherwise specified.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with hilar or mediastinal lymph nodes ≤ 1 cm and no abnormal hilar or&#xD;
             mediastinal uptake on PET and CT will be considered N0. Mediastinal lymph node biopsy&#xD;
             is required for patients with visible nodes: patients with &gt; 1 cm hilar or mediastinal&#xD;
             lymph nodes on CT or with nodes appearing as abnormal on PET (including suspicious but&#xD;
             nondiagnostic uptake). Such patients will not be eligible unless directed biopsies of&#xD;
             all abnormal lymph nodes are negative for cancer or these nodes demonstrate a lack of&#xD;
             change during the prior 6 months and thus are considered to be non-malignant.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The patient must be considered a reasonable candidate for surgical resection using a&#xD;
             lobectomy or pneumonectomy of the primary tumor within 6 weeks prior to registration,&#xD;
             according to the following criteria based on the American College of Chest Physicians&#xD;
             guidelines [165]:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  A qualified thoracic surgeon should make the determination that there would be a&#xD;
                  high likelihood of negative surgical margins;&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Baseline FEV1 &gt;60% predicted, postoperative predicted FEV1 &gt;40% predicted;&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Diffusion capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide (DLCO) &gt;60% predicted,&#xD;
                  postoperative predicted DLCO &gt; 40 % predicted;&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  No baseline hypoxemia and/or hypercapnia;&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  If the estimated postoperative FEV1 or DLCO &lt;40% predicted indicates an increased&#xD;
                  risk for perioperative complications, including death, from a standard lung&#xD;
                  cancer resection (lobectomy or greater removal of lung tissue), then&#xD;
                  cardiopulmonary exercise testing to measure maximal oxygen consumption (VO2max)&#xD;
                  must be &gt;60%;&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  No severe pulmonary hypertension;&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  No severe cerebral, acute or chronic cardiac, or peripheral vascular disease;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pleural effusion, if present, must be deemed too small to tap under CT guidance and&#xD;
             must not be evident on chest x-ray. Pleural effusion that appears on chest x-ray will&#xD;
             be permitted only if there is no evidence of malignancy after invasive cytologic&#xD;
             assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Appropriate stage for protocol entry, including no distant metastases, based upon the&#xD;
             following minimum diagnostic workup:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  History/physical examination, including documentation of weight within 6 weeks&#xD;
                  prior to registration;;&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Evaluation by an experienced thoracic surgeon within 6 weeks prior to&#xD;
                  registration;&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  FDG-PET/CT scan for staging and RT plan within 4 weeks prior to registration;&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  CT scan (preferably with intravenous contrast, unless medically contraindicated)&#xD;
                  within 4 weeks prior to registration to include the entirety of both lungs, the&#xD;
                  mediastinum, liver, and adrenal glands; primary tumor dimension will be measured&#xD;
                  on CT scan.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Zubrod Performance Status 0-1 within 6 weeks prior to registration;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age ≥ 18;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  For women of childbearing potential, a serum or urine pregnancy test must be negative&#xD;
             within 72 hours prior to registration;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Women of childbearing potential and male participants who are sexually active must&#xD;
             practice adequate contraception during treatment if assigned to treatment with SBRT.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must provide study specific informed consent prior to study entry.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Direct evidence of regional or distant metastases after PET and surgical staging&#xD;
             studies, or synchronous primary malignancy or prior invasive malignancy in the past 3&#xD;
             years, with the following exceptions:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  carcinoma in situ;&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  early stage skin cancer that has been definitively treated;&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  when an invasive malignancy has been treated definitively and the patient has&#xD;
                  remained disease free for ≥ 3 years;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Primary tumors &gt;3 cm;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prior systemic chemotherapy or thoracic surgery involving lobectomy or pneumonectomy;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prior radiotherapy to the region of the study cancer that would result in overlap of&#xD;
             radiation therapy fields;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pure bronchioloalveolar carcinoma subtype of non-small cell lung cancer;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Active systemic, pulmonary, or pleural pericardial infection;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnancy or women of childbearing potential and men who are sexually active and not&#xD;
             willing/able to use medically acceptable forms of contraception; this exclusion is&#xD;
             necessary because the treatment involved in this study may be significantly&#xD;
             teratogenic.&#xD;
