  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of an electronic&#xD;
      cognitive behavioral therapy application (eCBT Mood) compared to a control group consisting&#xD;
      of a mood monitoring handheld computer application in the treatment of patients with mild to&#xD;
      moderate major depressive disorder.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, randomized, comparator-controlled, two-arm, parallel group study to&#xD;
      examine the safety and efficacy of eCBT Mood, a handheld, computerized, electronic cognitive&#xD;
      behavioral therapy (CBT) application, in patients with major depressive disorder (MDD). The&#xD;
      study will involve 100 patients with mild to moderate MDD randomly assigned to daily use of&#xD;
      either a CBT application focused on depression ('eCBT Mood'; MindApps, llc) or a&#xD;
      comparator-controlled group using a mood monitoring application ('Mood Tracker'; GP&#xD;
      International). This study design and duration of the study is consistent with other studies&#xD;
      employing comparator-controlled designs in the study of CBT interventions, including&#xD;
      computerized CBT interventions, among patients with MDD (e.g., Andrews et al., 2010;&#xD;
      McKendree-Smith et al., 2003).&#xD;
&#xD;
      After being screened to ensure that the patients meet the required diagnostic, depression&#xD;
      severity, and other inclusion criteria, patients will be randomly assigned (1:1) to use&#xD;
      either eCBT Mood, a computer application running on the Apple® iPhone™ or iPod Touch®&#xD;
      handheld computer platforms. The application includes: (1) a psychoeducation module on the&#xD;
      relationships among thoughts, feelings, and behaviors, (2) a 6-item daily depression&#xD;
      assessment with the option to e-mail the summary score and suicidal ideation assessment&#xD;
      response to a 3rd party, (3) a negative automatic thought identification module, (4) a&#xD;
      feelings and thoughts log, (5) a module enabling the user to challenge their negative&#xD;
      automatic thoughts, (6) an assessment and challenge module regarding core beliefs which&#xD;
      underlie many automatic thoughts, (7) optional compliance reminders to use the application or&#xD;
      take medicines, and (8) links to behavioral science-based online content regarding MDD from&#xD;
      PsychCentral (see www.psychcentral.com). In contrast, the comparator control condition will&#xD;
      use Mood Tracker, which is also a a computer application running on the Apple iPhone or iPod&#xD;
      Touch handheld computer platforms. This application enables users to rate their mood using&#xD;
      expressive faces on a daily basis, log about their daily feelings, and also has an option&#xD;
      enabling an e-mail to be sent to a 3rd party regarding their daily mood ratings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Throughout the 8-week study period, patients will complete both in-person and telephone-based&#xD;
      assessments of their depression severity, mood, frequency of negative automatic thoughts, and&#xD;
      safety assessments.&#xD;
