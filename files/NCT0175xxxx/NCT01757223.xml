  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposed Phase I/II clinical trial will be used to determine the safety and toxicity of&#xD;
      direct administration of the vector AdVEGF-All6A+ to the ischemic myocardium and to generate&#xD;
      preliminary evidence regarding whether direct administration of AdVEGF-All6A+ to the ischemic&#xD;
      myocardium will induce growth of collateral blood vessels and improve cardiac function. This&#xD;
      is a three-part, multinational/multi-center, placebo controlled study.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Coronary artery disease (CAD) is the predominant cause of heart failure, a major cause of&#xD;
      death and disability throughout the world. Although prognosis of patients with CAD has been&#xD;
      greatly improved by advances in cardiovascular treatment, it is still the first cause of&#xD;
      death in the USA. Treatment options for CAD include diet, exercise, medication, balloon&#xD;
      angioplasty with or without stenting, atherectomy and bypass surgery. For many patients,&#xD;
      however, the disease is diffuse and stenting or bypass surgery is not an option. A new&#xD;
      strategy to treat these patients is to use gene therapy to induce new networks of new blood&#xD;
      vessels to bypass the arterial system that is blocked, thus providing circulation to deliver&#xD;
      oxygen needed by the tissue. By administering a gene coding for vascular endothelial growth&#xD;
      factor (VEGF) to the myocardium, new networks of blood vessels can be created using the&#xD;
      genetic material for VEGF. In experimental animal studies, VEGF is effective at treating&#xD;
      ischemia of organs and is safe. The most direct method of transferring genes to myocardium is&#xD;
      by injection under direct vision during a minimally invasive thoracic surgery. For the&#xD;
      present study, the VEGF gene will be delivered to the myocardium using a modified adenovirus&#xD;
      (Ad) as a carrier. The study is designed to test the safety and efficacy of AdVEGF-All6A+.&#xD;
