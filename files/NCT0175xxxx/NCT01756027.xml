    <textblock>
      Up to 12 subjects will be enrolled. Enrolled subjects will receive one or two Ultherapy&#xD;
      treatments on the cheeks, depending on their assigned study group. Follow-up visits will&#xD;
      occur 14, 30 and 90 days post-treatment. Study images will be obtained pre-treatment, 30-60&#xD;
      min post-treatment, and at each follow-up visit.&#xD;

      This study is a prospective, randomized, single-center clinical trial. The study will be&#xD;
      conducted in two Phases. In Phase I, subjects will be assigned to one of two treatment&#xD;
      groups. One study group will receive one dual depth Ultherapy treatment to a region on the&#xD;
      cheeks, and one study group will receive two dual depth Ultherapy treatments to a region on&#xD;
      the cheeks 14 days apart. Average pain scores will be obtained using a Numeric Rating Scale&#xD;
      following each region of treatment and for each depth of treatment. In Phase II, based on&#xD;
      observations of last follow-up visit in Phase I (at 90 days after treatment), subjects will&#xD;
      be given the option to receive treatment of the affected area(s) for the protocol specified&#xD;
      region, treated at the treatment depth showing the most efficacy in Phase I. Efficacy will be&#xD;
      determined by improvement in Erythematotelangiectatic Rosacea in the treatment area versus&#xD;
      control (an untreated area) as determined by primary investigator assessment at the last&#xD;
      follow-up visit in Phase I.&#xD;
