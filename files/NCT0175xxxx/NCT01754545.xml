  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Congenital thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP), also called Upshaw-Schulman Syndrome or&#xD;
      hereditary or familial TTP is a rare, but severe disease. The purpose of this study is to&#xD;
      determine how infusions of plasma to patients with congenital TTP correlate with symptoms and&#xD;
      signs of activity of the disease, and to determine why some patients need more frequent&#xD;
      infusions of plasma than others to prevent acute attacks of the disease.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with congenital TTP have an inherited lack of function or amount of a protein in&#xD;
      plasma called ADAMTS13, that otherwise is responsible for cleaving large von&#xD;
      Willebrand-molecules into smaller parts. The patients suffer recurrent attacks of clotting of&#xD;
      small blood vessels, that can cause damage to major organs, including the central nervous&#xD;
      system. Acute attacks can be treated successfully with infusions of human plasma, and some&#xD;
      patients also receive regular plasma therapy for prevention of acute attacks. A small group&#xD;
      of patients receive preventive plasma infusions twice or more weekly, indicating a much&#xD;
      higher need for plasma than what is otherwise recommended for preventive therapy. Do these&#xD;
      patients have an ongoing activity of their disease despite a stimulus? Or a higher turn-over&#xD;
      of transfused ADAMTS13? Have these patients developed antibodies against transfused ADAMTS13?&#xD;
      Are any symptoms correlated with signs of disease activity?&#xD;
