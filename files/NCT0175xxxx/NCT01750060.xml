    <textblock>
      &quot;This study is a single-center, randomized, open-label, 3-period, 5-treatment, 6-sequence&#xD;
      design. A total of 54 eligible subjects will receive three total treatments; one with&#xD;
      intravenous (IV) infusion and two with the Study System. Each subject will be randomly&#xD;
      assigned to receive a treatment sequence consisting of Treatment A (IV fentanyl citrate),&#xD;
      Study System Treatment B (170 mcAmp), and one of three additional Study System treatments&#xD;
      (140 mcAmp or 200 mcAmp or 230 mcAmp) &quot;&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      &quot;The Study System is a single-use system that consists of two parts: a Drug Unit containing&#xD;
      10.8 mg fentanyl hydrochloride, and a Controller that supplies the dosing current. The two&#xD;
      parts are packaged separately and assembled immediately prior to use. The Study System will&#xD;
      be applied to the upper, outer arm of each subject. Fentanyl will be delivered from the Study&#xD;
      System via transdermal iontophoresis using a current of 170 mcAmp (Treatment B), 140 mcAmp&#xD;
      (Treatment C), 200 mcAmp (Treatment D), or 230 mcAmp (Treatment E). Each subject will be&#xD;
      randomly assigned to a treatment sequence consisting of Treatment A (IV fentanyl citrate),&#xD;
      Study System Treatment B (170 mcAmp), and one of three additional Study System treatments&#xD;
      consisting of Treatment C (140 mcAmp), Treatment D (200 mcAmp), or Treatment E (230 mcAmp).&#xD;
      Each subject will therefore receive a total of three treatments (A and B and either C, D, or&#xD;
      E).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The specific treatments are outlined in detail below:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Treatment A: Fentanyl citrate (equivalent to 80 mcg fentanyl) administered over 20&#xD;
           minutes by IV infusion every hour through 23.33 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Treatment B: Two consecutive 40 mcg fentanyl doses each delivered over 10 minutes by the&#xD;
           Study System (170 mcAmp) every hour through 23.33 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Treatment C: Two consecutive 35 mcg fentanyl doses, each delivered over 10 minutes by&#xD;
           the Study System (140 mcAmp) every hour through 23.33 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Treatment D: Two consecutive 50 mcg fentanyl doses, each delivered over 10 minutes by&#xD;
           the Study System (200 mcAmp) every hour through 23.33 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Treatment E: Two consecutive 54 mcg fentanyl doses, each delivered over 10 minutes by&#xD;
           the Study System (230 mcAmp) every hour through 23.33 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Naltrexone (50 mg) will be administered orally (PO) every 12 hours, beginning 14 hours before&#xD;
      the start of each fentanyl treatment and ending approximately 11 hours after completion of&#xD;
      each treatment &quot;&#xD;
