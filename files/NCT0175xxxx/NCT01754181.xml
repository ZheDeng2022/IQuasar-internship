  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main objective is to assess if the Diabeloop algorithm provides better glycemic control&#xD;
      than a &quot;manual&quot; usual algorithm of patients with type 1 diabetes treated by insulin pump&#xD;
      during meals, and during activity qualified &quot;moderate&quot; to &quot;severe&quot; by the patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be conducted in 18 patients. The investigation centers are: CHSF (for&#xD;
      Diabeloop algorithm test during activity), CHU of Grenoble and CHU of Toulouse (for Diabeloop&#xD;
      algorithm test during meals.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      -  Grenoble and Toulouse will test the prandial algorithm with several carbohydrate intake&#xD;
           and a primer of 50% or 75% of the total bolus. Groups of patients are described as&#xD;
           follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Group I: patients have a meal with the usual carbohydrate intake. The meal bolus is&#xD;
                made according to the current treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Group II: patients have a meal with a &quot;low&quot; carbohydrate intake (50% reduction of&#xD;
                carbohydrate).&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Group III: patients have a meal with a &quot;strong&quot; carbohydrate intake (increase 50%&#xD;
                of carbohydrate).&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Group IV: patients of group IV have each meal with carbohydrate intake but their&#xD;
                usual bolus will be omitted.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Inclusion visit V1: The study will be proposed at the patients who meet the&#xD;
                inclusion criteria. After signing the consent, the investigator shall designate one&#xD;
                group for each patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Visit V2 (24 hours before the visit V3): Installation, calibration and education of&#xD;
                two glucose sensors dexcom G4 ™ will be performed by a nurse. The patient will keep&#xD;
                two sensors until the end of the study (end of V4).&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Visit V3 (algorithm test): Patient will be fitted with its insulin pump and the two&#xD;
                sensors dexcom G4 ™. These will be coupled by the engineer LETI to the computer on&#xD;
                which is installed the control algorithm to be tested. Lunch will be taken at 1 pm.&#xD;
                The algorithm will provide proposals insulin every 15 minutes until 6 pm.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Visit V4 (patient control): Patient will be fitted with two sensors dexcom G4 ™ and&#xD;
                its insulin pump programmed according to the usual algorithm. The meal will be&#xD;
                taken at 1h PM. Patient can leave the site at 6 pm after removal of sensors.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  CHSF (Centre Hospitalier Sud Francilien) will test the algorithm glycemic control during&#xD;
           physical activity of moderate (50% VO2max) or high intensity (75% VO2max) for 30 minutes&#xD;
           on a bicycle ergometer. In different situations, three patient groups will be created:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Group A: Patients practice an &quot;average&quot; physical activity(50% VO2max) with usual&#xD;
                temporary basal reduction (usually 50% of reduction during the test and 2h next).&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Group B: Patients practice an &quot;intense&quot; physical activity (75% VO2max) with usual&#xD;
                temporary basal reduction (usually 80% of reduction during the test and 2h after).&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Group C: patients practice an &quot;average&quot; physical activity (50% VO2max) but without&#xD;
                concomitant reduction of temporary basal.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Inclusion visit V1 : The study will be proposed at the patients who meet the&#xD;
                inclusion criteria. After signing the consent, the investigator shall designate one&#xD;
                group for each patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Visit V2 : Patient will be equipped with two sensors dexcom G4 ™ and a heart rate&#xD;
                monitor. Calibrated meal is expected at 11h 30 pm. The patient will be administered&#xD;
                his insulin dose according to his usual algorithm. The physical test will begin&#xD;
                three hours after the meal. It will be carried on bicycle ergometer for 30 minutes&#xD;
                at an medium or high intensity. (Average = 50% VO2max, or high level = 75% VO2max).&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Visit V3: The same test is repeated for each patient during this visit. Its insulin&#xD;
                pump will be controlled by the doses proposal of the algorithm after manual&#xD;
                validation by the investigator. These will continue until the next morning, and the&#xD;
                patient will spend overnight in the hospital.&#xD;
