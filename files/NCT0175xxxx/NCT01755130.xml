      This clinical trial studies laser optoacoustic and ultrasonic imaging system assembly in&#xD;
      finding changes in tumors in patients with breast cancer. Diagnostic procedures, such as&#xD;
      laser optoacoustic and ultrasonic imaging system assembly, may help find and diagnose breast&#xD;
      cancer and find out how far the disease has spread.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To successfully obtain images from laser optoacoustic and ultrasonic imaging system&#xD;
      assembly (LOUISA) 3-dimensional (3D) and assess pathology in order to guide image calibration&#xD;
      and gain knowledge about LOUISA 3D capabilities to detect and differentiate breast tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Estimate and compare the false positive rate of LOUISA-3D compared to standard of care&#xD;
      ultrasound for detecting breast cancer in year 5 of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Determine optimal scanning parameters by assessing certain machine parameters (e.g.&#xD;
      illumination and detection conditions, laser pulse repetition rate, laser ultrasound emission&#xD;
      characteristics, type of imaging probe, two-dimensional images vs three-dimensional images,&#xD;
      coupling medium characteristics, software and firmware, etc.), anatomical information (speed&#xD;
      of sound image, acoustic attenuation image, acoustic scattering image), and functional&#xD;
      information (total hemoglobin distribution [THb]/image of angiogenesis density, image of&#xD;
      blood oxygen saturation [SO2], and image of water distribution).&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients undergo LOUISA 3D over approximately 30 minutes on the same day or within 7 days of&#xD;
      any breast imaging procedure and within 7 days before biopsy.&#xD;

             lesion[s])&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Tumor location - the mammography or ultrasound report should not say that the tumor is&#xD;
