  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) is a hereditary vascular condition characterized&#xD;
      by the development of abnormal connections between arteries and veins throughout the body,&#xD;
      called vascular malformations. These abnormal blood vessels are referred to as arteriovenous&#xD;
      malformations (AVM) if they are large and telangiectasias if they are small. Telangiectasias&#xD;
      develop due to irregular growth of blood vessels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anti-angiogenic therapy, such as the drug Apo-Timop, curbs the growth of new blood vessels.&#xD;
      Apo-Timop is included in a class of medications called beta-blockers. Anti-angiogenic&#xD;
      therapies exert their beneficial effects in a number of ways: by disabling the agents that&#xD;
      activate and promote cell growth, or by directly blocking the growing blood vessel cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators think that anti-angiogenic therapy may lead to the shrinking of&#xD;
      telangiectasia in people with HHT. The investigators hope that this study will provide us&#xD;
      with proof of this concept and might lead to the development and study of anti-angiogenic&#xD;
      therapies to help improve the lives of individuals with vascular malformations.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a small study of 10 patients from St. Michael's Hospital who have HHT and at least 5&#xD;
      typical telangiectasias.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who anticipate a major surgery during this study or are pregnant, breast feeding or&#xD;
      on other beta blocker medication may not enroll in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study lasts 12 weeks. During this time, subjects will apply a drop of either Apo-timop&#xD;
      0.5% or a placebo solution to 4 telangiectasias twice daily.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The active study medication is called Apo-Timop and is a clear liquid solution stored in a&#xD;
      bottle. An eye dropper is used for application.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Apo-timop will be applied to 3 telangiectasias and&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  a placebo will be applied to one telangiectasia A placebo is an inactive substance, with&#xD;
           no active medication in it, and it looks the same as the real medication. There is no&#xD;
           potential harm of receiving the placebo. It is necessary to use a placebo to make sure&#xD;
           that the effect of Apo-timop can be determined without any bias.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will receive four numbered bottles for every 28 day period as well as a photo which&#xD;
      indicates which bottle is to be applied to which telangiectasia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Neither the subject nor the research staff will know which telangiectasia will receive the&#xD;
      placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Apo-timop, is not part of the standard therapeutic regimen for HHT. It is a Health Canada&#xD;
      approved medication which is applied as an eye drop, that has been shown to reduce pressure&#xD;
      in the eye and is commonly used for glaucoma.&#xD;
