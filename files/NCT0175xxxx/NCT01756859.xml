  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Death from chronic liver disease has doubled in the UK over the last decade. This is largely&#xD;
      due to the rise in liver disease from excess alcohol consumption, obesity related fatty liver&#xD;
      disease and hepatitis B &amp; C infections. The current 'liver tests' only identify liver injury&#xD;
      when the damage is at an advanced stage. They neither estimate the degree of injury&#xD;
      accurately nor help judge prognosis. The complications from chronic liver disease result&#xD;
      mainly from raised pressures within the liver. We currently measure this pressure by passing&#xD;
      a long catheter through the jugular vein in the neck into the liver. This invasive test does&#xD;
      carry a small yet significant risk of complications and is not available outside specialised&#xD;
      liver centres. Raised pressure within the liver is also associated with changes in the&#xD;
      microorganisms within the gut. This leads to increased infective complications among patients&#xD;
      with liver cirrhosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We aim to noninvasively measure the pressures within the liver using Magnetic Resonance&#xD;
      Imaging (MRI). We will recruit 49 patients with chronic liver disease who have had liver&#xD;
      pressure measurements as part of their routine clinical assessment. The participants will&#xD;
      attend the Biomedical Research Unit and the MR Centre for a single 2hour visit. We will also&#xD;
      collect blood, urine and stool samples from them.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The diagnostic accuracy of the quantitative MRI techniques will be validated against the&#xD;
      pressures obtained via the invasive test. The quantitative MRI techniques will also&#xD;
      correlated with biomarkers of liver injury obtained from blood and urine samples. The stool&#xD;
      sample obtained will be used to characterise the gut microorganisms in these patients.&#xD;

        Participants will be recruited from liver services from Nottingham University Hospitals NHS&#xD;
        Trust and Derby Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust. All the patients will have had HVPG&#xD;
        measurements performed for clinical indications.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Patients of more than 18 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Patients who have had HVPG measurements within the last 6 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Underlying portal hypertension due to chronic liver disease - alcoholic liver disease,&#xD;
             non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), chronic hepatitis B or C and&#xD;
             heamochromatosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Patients investigated with a clinical suspicion of portal hypertension, but have&#xD;
             normal portal pressures on HVPG measurements.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Ability to consent to participate in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Patients with underlying diseases which are NOT related to alcohol excess, NAFLD,&#xD;
             chronic hepatitis B, C or haemochromatosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Abdominal/waist circumference greater than 112 cm (44 inches) due to scanner bore&#xD;
             constraints&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Pregnant women.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Absolute contraindications for MRI. Any patient that indicates on the MR safety&#xD;
             questionnaire that they have or suspect they may have metal in their eye(s) will&#xD;
             require an x-ray prior to their MRI scan confirming that their eye(s) are free from&#xD;
             metal. This will be verified using previous x-ray records. Any patient whose previous&#xD;
             records indicate that they may have had metal in their eye(s) or any patients without&#xD;
             any x-ray records will be x-rayed for the purposes of this study. Any patient having&#xD;
             current metal in their eye(s), will not be given an MRI scan and therefore will not be&#xD;
             recruited into the study.&#xD;
