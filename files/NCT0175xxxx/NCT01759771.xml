      Vitamin D promotes the differentiation of prostate cancer cells and maintains the&#xD;
      differentiated phenotype of prostate epithelial cells. The results of the investigators'&#xD;
      clinical studies indicate that vitamin D3 supplementation results in a decrease of positive&#xD;
      cancer cores at repeat biopsy in subjects with low-risk prostate cancer. The investigators&#xD;
      hypothesize that Veterans who have early-stage prostate cancer and who take vitamin D3 at&#xD;
      4000 international units per day (intervention group) will show an improvement in the number&#xD;
      of positive cores and in Gleason score at repeat biopsy, and a decreased likelihood of&#xD;
      undergoing definitive treatment (prostatectomy or radiation therapy), compared to Veteran&#xD;
      subjects taking placebo (control group).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The central hypothesis of this grant application is that vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol)&#xD;
      supplementation will benefit Veteran subjects diagnosed with early-stage, low-risk prostate&#xD;
      cancer, who elect to have their disease monitored through active surveillance. Specifically,&#xD;
      the investigators hypothesize that Veterans who take vitamin D3 at a daily dose of 4000&#xD;
      international units (IU) for a minimum of one year (intervention group) will show an&#xD;
      improvement in the number of positive cores and in Gleason score at repeat biopsy, and a&#xD;
      decreased likelihood of undergoing additional treatment (hormone therapy, prostatectomy or&#xD;
      radiation therapy), compared to Veterans taking placebo (control group).&#xD;
&#xD;
      To test this hypothesis, the investigators propose the following Specific Aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To determine whether vitamin D3 (4,000 IU per day FOR AT LEAST ONE YEAR) will result in&#xD;
           a significant improvement of the pathology status at repeat biopsy in Veteran subjects&#xD;
           taking vitamin D3, compared to Veteran subjects taking placebo. This hypothesis will be&#xD;
           tested through a randomized clinical trial, which will enroll 136 Veteran subjects (68&#xD;
           participants per arm), diagnosed with early-stage prostate cancer (Gleason score 6, PSA&#xD;
           10, clinical stage T1C or T2a). The pathology status will be measured by the change in&#xD;
           Gleason score and the number of positive cores in prostate needle biopsy specimens&#xD;
           between baseline and the end of the study. Pre- and post-study biopsies will be&#xD;
           performed as part of the standard medical care for diagnosis and active surveillance.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To determine whether vitamin D3 supplementation, compared to placebo, will result in a&#xD;
           significant decrease in the number of Veteran subjects who will undergo additional&#xD;
           treatment (hormone therapy, prostatectomy or radiation therapy), following the outcome&#xD;
           of repeat biopsy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To analyze changes in the serum levels of cholecalciferol, 25(OH)D, 1,25(OH)2D, and&#xD;
           prostate-specific antigen (PSA) at baseline and at the end of the study, and to estimate&#xD;
           the associations between changes in these measures and pathology outcomes (Gleason score&#xD;
           and number of positive cores).&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To compare the expression of molecular biomarkers, which are prognostically relevant to&#xD;
           prostate cancer progression, in pre- and post- treatment biopsy tissue specimens.&#xD;
           Paraffin-embedded sections will be processed to assess by immunohistochemical techniques&#xD;
           the expression of the following biomarkers: Vitamin D Receptor (VDR), P21, Tumor Growth&#xD;
           Factor (TGF ), Cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2), and NF B. All of these protein products impact&#xD;
           growth control and chronic inflammation in prostate cancer progression and are&#xD;
           specifically affected by Vitamin D status.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Implementation of the proposed studies would demonstrate that Vitamin D3 supplementation&#xD;
      provides a welcome addition to active surveillance, since patients who respond to Vitamin D3&#xD;
      supplementation (as indicated by a decrease in score or number of positive cores at repeat&#xD;
      biopsy) can safely continue active surveillance and would not need definitive treatment. In&#xD;
      turn, this would result in a decreased likelihood of overtreatment. On the other hand,&#xD;
      subjects who progress after Vitamin D3 supplementation, as indicated by an increase in&#xD;
      Gleason score or number of positive cores at repeat biopsy, may have more aggressive disease&#xD;
      and may need to consider definitive treatment. Therefore, both groups of patients (responders&#xD;
      as well as non-responders) would benefit from Vitamin D3 supplementation, an intervention&#xD;
      strategy that is extremely cost-effective and easy to implement.&#xD;
