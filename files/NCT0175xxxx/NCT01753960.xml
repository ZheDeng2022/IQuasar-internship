    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether Noninvasive and Continuous Hemoglobin&#xD;
      Monitoring (NACHO) for Surgical Blood Management affects transfusion decision making&#xD;
      algorithm in the operating room.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Blood transfusions are associated with various risks including viral infections, delayed&#xD;
      wound healing, transfusion related acute lung injury and cardiovascular complications.&#xD;
      Despite limitations, and ongoing efforts to identify and validate other&#xD;
      more-physiologically-relevant &quot;triggers&quot; for blood transfusions, hemoglobin-based transfusion&#xD;
      triggers are still commonly used in practice, as well as in all currently available&#xD;
      transfusion guidelines, alone, or in combination with other parameters. In the operating room&#xD;
      the anesthesiologist has to withdraw blood from the patient and send it to the lab or the&#xD;
      blood gas machine to achieve hemoglobin levels. It may be suggested that the ability to&#xD;
      continuously monitor hemoglobin levels may help physicians to take more appropriate&#xD;
      transfusion decisions; i.e, the physicians will either identify critical decreases in&#xD;
      hemoglobin levels earlier and respond appropriately or avoid over-transfusing when hemoglobin&#xD;
      levels have not decreased yet. Accordingly, monitors of hemoglobin levels are used in the&#xD;
      operating theatre in many centers, although their blood-conserving effect has not been proven&#xD;
      yet.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We believe that the transfusion decision making algorithm in the operating room relies less&#xD;
      heavily on &quot;on spot&quot; measures of hemoglobin levels but rather on patient's comorbidities,&#xD;
      expected additional bleeding according to the surgery and the surgeon, the course of the&#xD;
      operation (the operating field is &quot;open&quot; and thus surgeons can tell if it is oozing or frank&#xD;
      bleeding, if they can control bleeding promptly or not etc..), hemodynamic data available&#xD;
      from the different invasive and non-invasive monitors, pressure from the surgeon, etc. It is&#xD;
      therefore suggested that continuous monitoring of hemoglobin levels may be less relevant in&#xD;
      this environment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aims/Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The primary hypothesis is that continuous noninvasive hemoglobin monitoring will not&#xD;
           reduce the number of blood transfusions in patients undergoing surgeries associated with&#xD;
           a significant risk of bleeding.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The secondary hypothesis is that in patients monitored with continuous noninvasive&#xD;
           hemoglobin, there will not be earlier warning of critical drops in hemoglobin, resulting&#xD;
           in less frequent complications compared with patients who are not being monitored with&#xD;
           continuous noninvasive hemoglobin.&#xD;
