  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the effectiveness of Autologous Bone Marrow-Derived&#xD;
      Mesenchymal Stem Cells (MSCs) in the treatment of non-healing wounds.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Sixty-six (66) subjects are planned to be enrolled into the trial. each subject's duration of&#xD;
      participation will be 24 weeks on therapy with a 4 week post-treatment visit. A run-in phase&#xD;
      of 2 weeks will be required prior to randomization/enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All subjects will receive appropriate and standard care for chronic wounds, including&#xD;
      dressings, bandages, and off-loading, if required. All subjects will receive either saline,&#xD;
      fibrin or MSCs in fibrin using an identical double-barreled syringe to keep the blind.&#xD;
      Therefore, subjects will then be randomized to one of three groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. conventional standard therapy and control saline spray&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. conventional standard therapy and fibrin spray&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. conventional standard therapy and MSCs (autologous bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem&#xD;
           cell)in fibrin spray&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening Visit:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All inclusion and exclusion information will be reviewed to make sure that the subject is&#xD;
      eligible for entry into the study. The following procedures will be performed during this two&#xD;
      week period:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Biopsy - One (3 x 6 mm) biopsy will be taken from the edge of the wound for additional&#xD;
      diagnostic tests and for culturing of cells. The second (3-4 mm) biopsy will be taken from&#xD;
      the thigh for culturing of cells in the laboratory to assess the healing process. The thigh&#xD;
      biopsy will then be excised by taking about 3/4 inch long by 1/4 inch wide margin from around&#xD;
      it, and suturing it closed. The reason for this biopsy of the normal skin is so that it can&#xD;
      be used to compare the healing process to the chronic wound.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood Sampling - Blood will be drawn for laboratory testing to assess the overall well-being,&#xD;
      HIV, Hepatitis B &amp; C and if the subject is a woman able to bear children, to test for&#xD;
      pregnancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Wound Measurements - Wound measurements will be taken to determine the size of the wound and&#xD;
      to assess for healing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization Visit:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the wound has not reduced significantly in size, and the subject is still eligible for the&#xD;
      study; he/she will be assigned to a study treatment. The decision as to which treatment&#xD;
      he/she will receive will be determined by a process called randomization. Randomization is a&#xD;
      mathematical process used to guarantee that each participant in the study has an equal chance&#xD;
      of being assigned to any of the treatment options available.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The treatment groups that the subject may be assigned to are as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group #1 - Conventional Therapy and Control Saline Spray -The subject will receive&#xD;
      conventional therapy, wound measurements, photography and observations. At the Day 1&#xD;
      treatment visit a double-barrel syringe system will be used to deliver topically normal&#xD;
      saline to the wound. Up to 2 additional treatments will be applied at Weeks 3 &amp; 6 (+ or - 2&#xD;
      or 3 days).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group #2 -Conventional Therapy and Fibrin Spray - The subject will receive conventional&#xD;
      therapy, wound measurements, photography, and observations. At the Day 1 treatment visit a&#xD;
      double-barrel syringe system will be used to deliver topically fibrin alone to the wound. Up&#xD;
      to 2 additional treatments will be applied at Weeks 3 &amp; 6 (+ or - 2 or 3 days).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group #3 - Conventional Therapy and Autologous Bone Marrow-Derived Mesenchymal Stem Cells in&#xD;
      Fibrin Spray - The subject will receive conventional therapy, wound measurements, photography&#xD;
      and observations. At the Day 1 treatment visit a double-barrel syringe system will be used to&#xD;
      deliver topically autologous bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells in fibrin. Up to 2&#xD;
      additional treatments will be applied at Weeks 3 &amp; 6 (+ or - 2 or 3 days) if your wound is&#xD;
      not healed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Conventional Therapy - The subject will receive standard of care and accepted conventional&#xD;
      therapy, regardless of which of the three groups you will be randomized in. This standard of&#xD;
      care involves the use of dressings, bandages and protective ways to increase healing of your&#xD;
      wound.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bone Marrow Aspirate - Depending on the treatment group that the subject is assigned to, they&#xD;
      will have either a bone marrow aspirate and/or sham (imitation) aspirate performed at this&#xD;
      visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Day 1 Treatment Visit:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All groups will receive the study treatment that was assigned at the randomization visit.&#xD;
      Wound measurements, clinical observations, wound dressings, adverse event reporting and&#xD;
      photography will be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Weekly Follow-up Visits (Weeks 1-24):&#xD;
&#xD;
      All groups will return weekly for conventional therapy, wound measurements, clinical&#xD;
      observations, wound dressing changes, adverse event report, and photography. Two additional&#xD;
      study treatments will be given at Weeks 3 &amp; 6 (+ or - 2 or 3 days) if the wound is not&#xD;
      healed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post-Treatment Follow-up Visit (Week 28):&#xD;
&#xD;
      All groups will return one month after 24 weeks of treatment for evaluation, wound&#xD;
      measurements, and photography.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up wound Biopsies:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants in all three study treatment groups will be asked to have an additional biopsy&#xD;
      of the wound edge at Week 6. This biopsy will only be taken if the wound has not healed.&#xD;
