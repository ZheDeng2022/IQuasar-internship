  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This was a four part, phase I/II study aimed to evaluate the safety, tolerability and&#xD;
      efficacy of combination of an anti-EGFR antibody panitumumab (P) either with a BRAF inhibitor&#xD;
      (dabrafenib (D); GSK2118436) alone or with the combination of a BRAF inhibitor and a MEK&#xD;
      inhibitor (trametinib (T); GSK1120212) in patients with BRAF-mutant V600E advanced or mCRC.&#xD;
      The goal was to: 1) Determine RP2R/MTD for doublet (D+P) and triplet (D+T+P) combinations in&#xD;
      Part 1; 2) Assess clinical activity for these combinations in Part 2; 3) Determine RP2R/MTD&#xD;
      for double (T+P) combination in Part 4A, and assess clinical activity of this combination in&#xD;
      two patient populations in Part 4B (patients with BRAF-V600E mutation-positive advanced or&#xD;
      metastatic CRC and patients with advanced or metastatic CRC with secondary resistance to&#xD;
      anti-EGFR therapy).&#xD;

      Part 1: Dose escalation This was a dose escalation part intended to evaluate safety,&#xD;
      tolerability, PK, PD, clinical activity and determine RP2R/MTD for the doublet (D+P) and the&#xD;
      triplet (D+T+P) combinations in patients with BRAF-mutation V600E positive advanced or&#xD;
      metastatic CRC. A 3+3 dose escalation procedure was followed. Dosing for dabrafenib and&#xD;
      trametinib was continuous daily dosing while panitumumab was dosed once every two weeks&#xD;
      (Q2W). Patients were evaluated for dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) during the first 28 days&#xD;
      of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 2A:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This was a cohort expansion part to assess the safety and preliminary clinical activity of&#xD;
      the optimal safe and tolerable dose combinations (D+P)/(D+T+P) defined in Part 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 2B:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this part, additional patients were enrolled into the triplet (D+T+P) combination at two&#xD;
      dose levels in to further explore safety, tolerability and clinical activity. Up to 10&#xD;
      patients each with no prior treatment (First Line Population), and up to 20 patients each&#xD;
      with at least one prior treatment (Second to Fourth Line Population) were planned to be&#xD;
      enrolled in dose Cohorts 3A and 4.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 3: Randomized Phase 2 Study The randomized phase 2 portion (Phase 3) of the study was&#xD;
      not pursued as the observed responses in any of the cohorts did not meet the predefined&#xD;
      criteria at the time of the preliminary analysis (data cut-off date: 06-May-2016).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 4 This part was designed to identify the RP2R/MTD and initial clinical activity for the&#xD;
      doublet (T+P) combination in patients BRAF-mutation V600E positive advanced or metastatic&#xD;
      CRC, and advanced or metastatic CRC with secondary resistance to prior anti-EGFR therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 4A: Dose Escalation This was a dose escalation part intended to determine RP2R/MTD for&#xD;
      the doublet (T+P) combination in patients with BRAF-mutation V600E positive advanced or&#xD;
      metastatic CRC. Approximately 18 patients (~6 each cohort) were planned to be enrolled in&#xD;
      Part 4A. A 3+3 dose escalation procedure was followed. Dosing for trametinib was continuous&#xD;
      daily dosing while panitumumab was dosed once every two weeks (Q2W). Patients were evaluated&#xD;
      for DLTs during the first 28 days of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 4B: Cohort Expansion This was a cohort expansion part intended to evaluate safety and&#xD;
      efficacy of the doublet (T+P) combination. Up to 20 patients in each of two expansion cohorts&#xD;
      were planned to be enrolled at the starting dose cohort or MTD from Part 4A.&#xD;

    <measure>Change in Levels of Proteins/Ribonucleic Acid (RNA)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Day 15</time_frame>
    <description>H-score or &quot;Histo-score&quot; measures cell membrane immunohistochemistry staining intensity in a fixed field. Membrane staining is categorized as 1+, 2+, or 3+. Minimum score is 0, maximum score is 300 (no subscale values are reported). H-score values themselves are not considered to be better or worse - measurements for levels of proteins/ribonucleic acid (RNA) are surrogate for MAPK pathway activity. Low values = low pathway activity. High values = high pathway activity. Changes in mean phosphorylated-ERK (pERK) and phosphorylated ribosomal protein S6 (pS6) H-score from baseline indicate changes in MAPK pathway activity that may be associated with treatment arms. A positive change from baseline suggests increased pathway activity. A negative change from baseline suggests decreased pathway activity. Total score is calculated as follows: [1 x (% cells 1+) + 2 x (% cells 2+) + 3 x (% cells 3+)].</description>

        <title>Part 3: Progression Free Survival (PFS)</title>
        <description>Progression Free Survival (PFS) was defined as the time from study treatment start date to the date of first radiologically documented progression or death due to any cause. If a patient did not progress or die at the time of the analysis data cut-off or start of new antineoplastic therapy, PFS was censored at the date of the last adequate tumor assessment before the earliest of the cut-off date or the start date of additional anti-neoplastic therapy. Progression was defined using Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria RECIST v1.1, as 20% increase in the sum of diameter of all measured target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum of diameter of all target lesions recorded at or after baseline and/or unequivocal progression of the non-target lesions and/or appearance of a new lesion. In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm.</description>

The original intention of the study was to include a randomized phase 2 portion of the study as a &quot;Part 3&quot;; however, a preliminary analysis did not meet predetermined criteria for efficacy.

        <description>Progression Free Survival (PFS) was defined as the time from study treatment start date to the date of first radiologically documented progression or death due to any cause. If a patient did not progress or die at the time of the analysis data cut-off or start of new antineoplastic therapy, PFS was censored at the date of the last adequate tumor assessment before the earliest of the cut-off date or the start date of additional anti-neoplastic therapy. Progression was defined using Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria RECIST v1.1, as 20% increase in the sum of diameter of all measured target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum of diameter of all target lesions recorded at or after baseline and/or unequivocal progression of the non-target lesions and/or appearance of a new lesion. In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm.</description>

        <title>Apparent Base Clearance (CL0/F) and Apparent Maximum Inducible Clearance at Steady State (CLIND,SS/F) of Dabrafenib in the Triple Combination (D+T+P) Estimated With a PopPK Model</title>
        <description>The population pharmacokinetic (PopPK) model of Dabrafenib can be described using a two-compartment model with a delayed 1st order absorption (Alag1, Ka) and an inducible elimination (CL/F) that consists of a base clearance (constant over time, CL0/F) and a dose- and time-dependent inducible clearance (CLind/F). The PopPK analysis examined the influence of demographics (i.e., weight) on the pharmacokinetics of dabrafenib. The apparent base clearance (CL0/F) and apparent maximum inducible clearance at steady state (CLIND,SS/F) of Dabrafenib estimated with the PopPK model are summarized in this record.</description>

        <title>Apparent Base Clearance (CL0/F) and Apparent Maximum Inducible Clearance at Steady State (CLIND,SS/F) of Dabrafenib in the Double Combination (T+P) Estimated With a PopPK Model</title>
        <description>The population pharmacokinetic (PopPK) model of Dabrafenib can be described using a two-compartment model with a delayed 1st order absorption (Alag1, Ka) and an inducible elimination (CL/F) that consists of a base clearance (constant over time, CL0/F) and a dose- and time-dependent inducible clearance (CLind/F). The PopPK analysis examined the influence of demographics (i.e., weight) on the pharmacokinetics of dabrafenib. The apparent base clearance (CL0/F) and apparent maximum inducible clearance at steady state (CLIND,SS/F) dabrafenib estimated with the PopPK model are summarized in this record.</description>

        <title>Time When Ka1 Transitions to Ka2 of Trametinib in the Double Combination (T+P) Estimated With a PopPK Model</title>
        <description>The population pharmacokinetic (PopPK) model of Trametinib can be described using a two-compartment model with dual sequential 1st order absorption (Ka1, Ka2) and 1st order elimination (CL/F). The PopPK analysis examined the influence of demographics (i.e., weight) on the pharmacokinetics of trametinib. The time when Ka1 transitions to Ka2 of Trametinib estimated with the PopPK model is summarized in this record.</description>

        <title>Change in Levels of Proteins/Ribonucleic Acid (RNA)</title>
        <description>H-score or &quot;Histo-score&quot; measures cell membrane immunohistochemistry staining intensity in a fixed field. Membrane staining is categorized as 1+, 2+, or 3+. Minimum score is 0, maximum score is 300 (no subscale values are reported). H-score values themselves are not considered to be better or worse - measurements for levels of proteins/ribonucleic acid (RNA) are surrogate for MAPK pathway activity. Low values = low pathway activity. High values = high pathway activity. Changes in mean phosphorylated-ERK (pERK) and phosphorylated ribosomal protein S6 (pS6) H-score from baseline indicate changes in MAPK pathway activity that may be associated with treatment arms. A positive change from baseline suggests increased pathway activity. A negative change from baseline suggests decreased pathway activity. Total score is calculated as follows: [1 x (% cells 1+) + 2 x (% cells 2+) + 3 x (% cells 3+)].</description>
