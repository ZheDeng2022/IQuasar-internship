  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The unifying objective of this project is to determine whether peanut oral immunotherapy (PN&#xD;
      OIT) induced clinical tolerance in the context of food allergy is significantly associated&#xD;
      with the expansion of a specific regulatory T cell subset (CD45RA- CD25++ FoxP3++) that is&#xD;
      thought to be inducible in the gut-associated lymphoid compartment and associated with&#xD;
      immunological tolerance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis of the study is that the induction of Treg cells will be associated with&#xD;
      clinical tolerance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will measure the change from baseline of induced Treg cells as a frequency&#xD;
      of total CD4 T cells during active treatment and compare that between participants who&#xD;
      achieve significant clinical tolerance (Tolerance and Partial Tolerance Groups as defined&#xD;
      below) and those who do not (Treatment Failure Group).&#xD;

      Clinical Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To evaluate whether PN OIT induces increased tolerance, defined as a statistically&#xD;
           significant increase in the median eliciting dose (ED) from a double-blind&#xD;
           placebo-controlled food challenge (DBPCFC) before and after treatment with PN OIT and&#xD;
           after subsequent allergen avoidance.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To evaluate whether PN OIT induces clinical desensitization, defined as 1) a median&#xD;
           10-fold or greater increase in ED at DBPCFC before and after PN OIT treatment period 2)&#xD;
           a statistically significant higher median ED at DBPCFC following treatment period&#xD;
           between active and control treatment; and 3) a significantly lower frequency of&#xD;
           accidental ingestion reactions in active versus control treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To evaluate the safety of PN OIT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mechanistic Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To determine whether PN OIT induces a statistically significant increase in the TCR&#xD;
           clonal diversity of Treg populations during active treatment among participants who&#xD;
           achieve increased clinical tolerance (Tolerance and Partial Tolerance Groups as defined&#xD;
           in clinical endpoints) versus the Treatment Failure Group.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To determine whether PN OIT suppresses mast cells by inducing a significant suppression&#xD;
           of the median ED on end-point dilution skin testing in actively treated participants by&#xD;
           the end of maintenance therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To determine whether PN OIT suppresses basophils as defined by a 10-fold suppression of&#xD;
           peanut-specific basophil ED in actively treated participants by end of a maintenance&#xD;
           period.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To determine whether either mast cell or basophil suppression at the end of maintenance&#xD;
           therapy is significantly associated with clinical outcomes following avoidance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exploratory Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To describe the gene expression profiles and clonal diversity of regulatory and effector&#xD;
           T cell subsets before and after OIT to better understand the phenotype and ontogeny of&#xD;
           these subsets and potentially discover new therapeutic pathways.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To engineer human MHC class II tetramers on common HLA backgrounds and map T cell&#xD;
           epitopes of the dominant peanut allergens for use in validating earlier findings and for&#xD;
           future studies of peanut-specific immune responses in humans.&#xD;

We conducted a nested case-control analysis of a subset of actively treated (by treatment outcome) versus placebo treated patients. Genomic DNA was used to amplify and sequence the complementarity-determining region 3 (CDR3) regions (immunoSEQ assay; Adaptive Biotechnologies).&#xD;
Enriched clonotypes in the CD154+ fraction (doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.11.088286) were analyzed for differences by Rank Abundance Curve analysis (R package alakazam; Chao A, et al. Ecology. 2015 96, 11891201) to determine differences in clonal diversity.</description>

Total RNA from CD154+ and CD154-CD69- T cells was used for cDNA synthesis and amplification. Libraries were prepared and sequenced to a read depth of approximately 30 million reads per sample (Illumina HiSeq) and aligned to the hg19 human reference genome with the ensemble version 75 annotation using STAR version 2.5.3a,(Dobin et al. Bioinformatics 2013) and gene expression was summarized using RSEM version 1.3.0 (Li et al. BMC Bioinform 2013). Differential expression analysis was performed using DESeq2 v 1.30.1 (R v 4.04). Significance level was set at an unadjusted P value less than .001.</description>

          <description>Participants will be randomly assigned by study statistician to treatment or placebo groups at a ratio of 3:1 following a double-blind placebo controlled food challenge, DBPCFC1, on 2 separate days. One challenge will consist of 5 doses of peanut in increasing amounts up to a total of 443 mg of peanut protein masked in vehicle food. The second day will consist of placebo material given similarly. Participants with an eliciting dose of 443mg or less will receive daily escalating dosages of peanut flour OIT in a blinded fashion, as described in the modified rush phase, until a daily dose of 4000 mg is reached. Following treatment, a 2nd challenge will occur DBPCFC2, identical to DBPCFC1, but with additional doses of 1000 mg and 3000 mg for a cumulative dose of 4443 mg peanut protein. After 12 weeks of complete peanut avoidance, participants will undergo a third challenge, DBPCFC3, which will follow a slightly different schedule of doses for a cumulative dose of 4430 mg peanut protein.</description>

          <description>Participants will be randomly assigned by study statistician to treatment or placebo groups at a ratio of 3:1 following a double-blind placebo controlled food challenge, DBPCFC1, on 2 separate days. One challenge will consist of 5 doses of peanut in increasing amounts up to a total of 443 mg of peanut protein masked in vehicle food. The second day will consist of placebo material given similarly. Participants with an eliciting dose of 443mg or less will receive daily escalating dosages of peanut flour OIT in a blinded fashion, as described in the modified rush phase, until a daily dose of 4000 mg is reached. Following treatment, a 2nd challenge will occur DBPCFC2, identical to DBPCFC1, but with additional doses of 1000 mg and 3000 mg for a cumulative dose of 4443 mg peanut protein. After 12 weeks of complete peanut avoidance, participants will undergo a third challenge, DBPCFC3, which will follow a slightly different schedule of doses for a cumulative dose of 4430 mg peanut protein.</description>

            <description>Participants will be randomly assigned by study statistician to treatment or placebo groups at a ratio of 3:1 following a double-blind placebo controlled food challenge, DBPCFC1, on 2 separate days. One challenge will consist of 5 doses of peanut in increasing amounts up to a total of 443 mg of peanut protein masked in vehicle food. The second day will consist of placebo material given similarly. Participants with an eliciting dose of 443mg or less will receive daily escalating dosages of peanut flour OIT in a blinded fashion, as described in the modified rush phase, until a daily dose of 4000 mg is reached. Following treatment, a 2nd challenge will occur DBPCFC2, identical to DBPCFC1, but with additional doses of 1000 mg and 3000 mg for a cumulative dose of 4443 mg peanut protein. After 12 weeks of complete peanut avoidance, participants will undergo a third challenge, DBPCFC3, which will follow a slightly different schedule of doses for a cumulative dose of 4430 mg peanut protein.</description>

Total RNA from CD154+ and CD154-CD69- T cells was used for cDNA synthesis and amplification. Libraries were prepared and sequenced to a read depth of approximately 30 million reads per sample (Illumina HiSeq) and aligned to the hg19 human reference genome with the ensemble version 75 annotation using STAR version 2.5.3a,(Dobin et al. Bioinformatics 2013) and gene expression was summarized using RSEM version 1.3.0 (Li et al. BMC Bioinform 2013). Differential expression analysis was performed using DESeq2 v 1.30.1 (R v 4.04). Significance level was set at an unadjusted P value less than .001.</description>
