  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the accuracy of two continuous glucose monitoring&#xD;
      devices (the Dexcom G4 Platinum and Medtronic Enlite systems) in patients with type 1&#xD;
      diabetes mellitus.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will use two CE marked Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) systems; Dexcom G4&#xD;
      Platinum CGM CE-marked 2012 (Dexcom, USA) and the Medtronic Paradigm Veo system with Enlite&#xD;
      Sensor CE-marked 2011 (Medtronic, USA). Both the Dexcom G4 Platinum and the Medtronic Enlite&#xD;
      sensors will be obtained through normal commercial channels rather than directly from the&#xD;
      manufacturer. The two CGM sensors will be worn concomitantly by the participant during the&#xD;
      visit to the Clinical Research Center (CRC). This visit will have a duration of 6 hours.&#xD;
      Blood will be drawn for the determination of glucose levels. The patient will receive his&#xD;
      usual breakfast and an increased insulin bolus (180% of the patient's calculated mealtime&#xD;
      dose) will be administered to correct the breakfast glucose excursion with the aim of&#xD;
      inducing a period of minor hypoglycaemia. Blood sampling will continue until the end of the&#xD;
      admission. At the end of this CRC part, the patient will continue to wear the two sensors at&#xD;
      home. In the case of sensor failure before the CRC session on the third day into the study,&#xD;
      patients will be instructed to insert a new sensor per the manufacturer's instruction for use&#xD;
      and to notify study coordinators of the event. Sensors will be worn until the end of the six&#xD;
      day study duration. Patients will be asked to perform at least 6 fingersticks per day for&#xD;
      blood glucose measurements with the study glucometer. The study will end on the 6th day after&#xD;
      initial sensor insertion. Patients will return to the CRC to have the sensor removed and&#xD;
      their CGM sensor and blood glucometer data downloaded from the devices. In case of failure of&#xD;
      both sensors after the CRC session but before the scheduled six day study duration, patients&#xD;
      will return to the CRC for sensor removal and for data download.&#xD;
