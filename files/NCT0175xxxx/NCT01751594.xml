  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposed research study aims to conduct a culturally-based secondary prevention&#xD;
      intervention targeted toward HIV-positive Black young men who have sex with men (B-YMSM) to&#xD;
      explore (1) feasibility and acceptability (Trial 1 and Trial 2) and (2) evidence of potential&#xD;
      efficacy (Trial 2). The primary outcomes will be health promotion behaviors (i.e., treatment&#xD;
      adherence, sexual risk reduction, reduction in substance use behaviors, and HIV status&#xD;
      disclosure). Psychosocial factors (i.e. self-esteem, critical consciousness, and&#xD;
      socio-political awareness) will be examined as secondary outcomes.&#xD;

      First, the protocol team will finalize the development and manualization of Health 4 Life&#xD;
      (H4L) a comparison intervention, which will serve as the basis of comparison for Mobilizing&#xD;
      Our Voices for Empowerment (MOVE), the treatment intervention. H4L will be a health promotion&#xD;
      and life skills intervention to account for time and attention. Following this the protocol&#xD;
      team will then implement Trial 1. In this trial, the intervention specialist and a &quot;peer&#xD;
      buddy&quot; (intervention co-facilitator) from one AMTU will conduct one wave of both MOVE and&#xD;
      H4L. The team will then conduct an analysis of the process data and revise the two&#xD;
      interventions (MOVE and H4L). Upon revising the interventions, the protocol team will&#xD;
      implement Trial 2. In this trial, the protocol co-chairs and the interventionist from Trial 1&#xD;
      will train interventionists and peer buddies from four new AMTUs; these interventionists and&#xD;
      peer buddies will run the revised MOVE and H4L interventions. Each site will be designated as&#xD;
      either a treatment or comparison site, and they will conduct two waves of their assigned&#xD;
      intervention. The team at that time will conduct data analyses and then modify and manualize&#xD;
      the final version of MOVE and H4L.&#xD;

    <description>To finalize and manualize Mobilizing Our Voices for Empowerment (MOVE) resulting in an intervention with evidence of potential efficacy in reducing sexual risk and substance use behaviors and promoting treatment adherence and HIV status disclosure, as well as self-esteem, critical consciousness, and socio-political awareness. At the same time a non-critical consciousness intervention Health 4 Life (H4L) which will be used as comparison will also be finalized and manualized. H4L is primarily a health promotion and life skills intervention for HIV-positive B-YMSM.</description>

    <description>MOVE involves four sessions. Sessions 1 and 2 occur over a two-day time frame and are each one day long (approximately 8 hours in length). They will: lay the groundwork for the intervention; provide HIV and other sexual health-related information; introduce critical consciousness; Sessions 1 and 2 will begin the enhancement of critical consciousness and the action-reflection-action cycle. Sessions 3 and 4 are also one-day sessions each (approximately 8 hours in length) and will be administered at one month intervals following the completion of sessions 1 and 2. These sessions will be used to provide continued enhancement of critical consciousness and guided support, feedback, and social reinforcement for behavior change and self-efficacy related to increasing health-promoting behaviors and reducing HIV-related health risk behaviors.</description>
