  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary goal of the proposed clinical trial is to investigate the combined effects of&#xD;
      walking training and monoaminergic agents (SSRIs and TIZ) on motor function of individuals in&#xD;
      sub-acute (2-7 mo) human motor incomplete Spinal Cord Injury (SCI), with a primary emphasis&#xD;
      on improvement in locomotor capability. We hypothesize that the use of these drugs applied&#xD;
      early following SCI may facilitate independent stepping ability, and its combination with&#xD;
      intensive stepping training will result in improved locomotor recovery following incomplete&#xD;
      SCI. Loss of descending control via norepinephrine inputs following spinal cord injury can&#xD;
      impair normal sensorimotor function through depressing motor excitability and impairing&#xD;
      walking capacity. Replacing these inputs with drugs can alter the excitability and assist&#xD;
      with reorganization of locomotor circuits. Assessment of single-dose administration of these&#xD;
      agents has been tested in patients with motor incomplete spinal cord injury; only limited&#xD;
      changes in walking performance have been noted. The resultant onset of weakness and increase&#xD;
      in involuntary reflexes following motor incomplete SCI may partly be a result of damage to&#xD;
      descending pathways to the spinal cord that control the release of serotonin. In models of&#xD;
      SCI, for example, application of agents that simulate serotonin has been shown to change&#xD;
      voluntary motor behaviors, including improvement of walking recovery. In humans following&#xD;
      neurological injury, the effects of 5HT agents are unclear. Few previous reports indicate&#xD;
      improved motor function following administration of agents which enhance the available&#xD;
      serotonin in the brain, although some data suggests that increased serotonin may be&#xD;
      beneficial. In this application, we propose to study the effects of clinically used agents&#xD;
      that increase or decrease intrinsic serotonin activity in the brain on strength and walking&#xD;
      ability following human motor incomplete SCI. Using detailed electrophysiological recordings,&#xD;
      and biomechanical and behavioral measures, we will determine the effects of single or chronic&#xD;
      doses of these drugs on voluntary and involuntary motor behaviors during clinical measures&#xD;
      and walking measures. The novelty of this proposed research is the expectation that agents&#xD;
      that increase serotonin activity may increase abnormal reflexes in SCI, but simultaneously&#xD;
      help to facilitate motor and walking recovery. Despite potential improvements in voluntary&#xD;
      function, the use of pharmacological agents that may enhance spastic motor behaviors&#xD;
      following SCI is in marked contrast to the way in which drugs are typically used in the&#xD;
      clinical setting.&#xD;

      This is a phase I double blinded randomized control clinical trial. The procedures for&#xD;
      participation in both Aims of the study are described below in chronological order.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1 and 2: Explanation of the consent form and study procedures/protocol will be performed&#xD;
      in the Neurolocomotion laboratory (room 1382), with subjects and their families provided&#xD;
      ample time for questions. Subjects are provided substantial time to choose to participate,&#xD;
      and are provided the laboratory phone numbers/emails to contact the PI and research personnel&#xD;
      with any potential questions. In situations where the subject is unable to be transported to&#xD;
      the laboratory, the PI will explain the consent form at a time and location convenient for&#xD;
      the subject and/or their family. Subjects will then undergo a screening procedure to&#xD;
      determine if they are eligible to participate in the study based on inclusion/exclusion&#xD;
      criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Modified Ashworth scale (mod Ash, no units) will be used to detect velocity-dependent&#xD;
      resistance to passive muscle stretch/joint rotation. The modAsh will grossly assess&#xD;
      spasticity at bilateral knee extensors and knee flexors, with scores from 0-5 (1+ scores will&#xD;
      be converted to 2 and higher scores increased accordingly).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Spinal Cord Assessment Tools for Spasticity (SCATS, no units) will be employed to assess&#xD;
      flexor and extensor spasms and clonic activity of the plantarflexors (Benz et al. , 2005).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Independence in walking ability will be assessed at each assessment period using the Walking&#xD;
      Index for SCI II (WISCI II, which is a 21 point (0-20) ordinal scale which assigns a score&#xD;
      based on amount of physical assistance, bracing, and assistive device used to ambulate.&#xD;
      Notably, subjects will not be allowed to ambulate with braces extending above the knee. Six&#xD;
      minute walk test (m) will be assess walking around a continuous hall-way at subjects'&#xD;
      self-selected velocity, with distance determined each minute and summed over the entire six&#xD;
      minute duration (van Hedel et al. , 2005). Subjects will be asked to &quot;walk at your (their)&#xD;
      normal, comfortable pace&quot; with minimal physical assistance and bracing/devices as needed This&#xD;
      measure is significantly association with measures of community walking in subjects with&#xD;
      incomplete SCI (Saraf et al. , 2009).&#xD;
&#xD;
      BERG balance test will be administered. Gait Mat testing will be performed to guage&#xD;
      spatiotemporal aspects of walking. 6 minute walk test will be performed. Lower Extremity&#xD;
      Motor Score, Peak treadmill speed (m/s)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Same as above including strength evaluations : Ankle, knee, hip flexors/extensors tested&#xD;
      bilaterally (Biodex®).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects in Aim 2 will be tested at initial evaluation, after four weeks of initial training,&#xD;
      and will be repeated after each four weeks of training on either the placebo or study&#xD;
      medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects in Aim 2 will additionally be requested to return for follow up testing after one&#xD;
      year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be offered to participate in audio, videotaping and/or photography.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Women who are of childbearing age and are contemplating becoming pregnant will be required to&#xD;
      submit a pregnancy test and must notify the principal investigator immediately.&#xD;

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        A) Subjects with motor incomplete SCI (AIS C or D) of 1-9 mo. duration will be selected,&#xD;
        with anatomical lesions between C1-T10.&#xD;
&#xD;
        B) Subjects will be between 18 and 75 years of age . Note: grant application states 16-75,&#xD;
        however, we will be only including subjects 18-75.&#xD;
&#xD;
        C) All subjects must be previously ambulatory with passive range of motion consistent with&#xD;
        normal walking, and must include: ankle dorsiflexion ankle to 10° and plantarflexion to&#xD;
        30°, knee flexion from 0 to 90°, hip flexion/extension to 90° - -10°.&#xD;
&#xD;
        D) Subjects will be medically stable with medical clearance to participate, with absence of&#xD;
        concurrent severe medical illness, including unhealed decubiti, existing infection,&#xD;
        significant cardiovascular or metabolic disease which limits exercise participation,&#xD;
        significant osteoporosis (as indicated by history of fractures following injury), active&#xD;
        heterotrophic ossification in the lower extremities, known history of peripheral nerve&#xD;
        injury in lower legs, history of known traumatic head injury, and history of pulmonary&#xD;
        complications, including significant obstructive and/or restrictive lung diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
        E) Individuals who are undergoing concurrent physical therapy will not be excluded from the&#xD;
        study population, secondary to the use of the cross-over design. Physical therapy records&#xD;
        will be obtained to ascertain the amount and types of physical therapy services being&#xD;
        provided.&#xD;
&#xD;
        F) Women of childbearing potential will not be excluded, although women who are pregnant or&#xD;
        who are considering becoming pregnant will be excluded due to the trunk and pelvis&#xD;
        restraints required for use during locomotion, and secondary to the unknown effects of the&#xD;
        pharmacological agents on the developing fetus.&#xD;
&#xD;
        G) Patients with known liver, renal, or other metabolic disease that may interfere with&#xD;
        drug action and/or clearance will be excluded from the proposed study. These complications&#xD;
        will be partially obviated by requiring all patients to undergo specific medical procedures&#xD;
        (liver function tests, urinalysis) prior to admission.&#xD;
&#xD;
        H)Men and women will be recruited for participation in the proposed clinical trial at rates&#xD;
        consistent with national and local average of gender disparities of SCI (80% male, 20%&#xD;
        women). Women of childbearing potential will not be excluded, although women who are&#xD;
        pregnant or who are considering becoming pregnant will be excluded due to the trunk and&#xD;
        pelvis restraints required for use during locomotion, and secondary to the unknown effects&#xD;
        of the test agent (SSRIs) on the developing fetus. Women who use oral contraceptives will&#xD;
        not be assessed for TIZ experiments and will be excluded from Aim 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
        I) Individuals of different ethnicities will be recruited at rates similar to the national&#xD;
        and local ethnicity rates. Current data since 2005 indicate that of the entire population&#xD;
        of SCI, 66.1% are Caucasian, 27.1% are African American, 6.6% are of Hispanic origin, and&#xD;
        2.0% are Asian. These populations closely resemble those at RIC and in our previous studies&#xD;
        in human SCI.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        A) Subjects who are ventilator-dependent will be excluded secondary to severely impaired&#xD;
        respiratory capacity.&#xD;
&#xD;
        B) Subjects with substantial orthopedic bracing to stabilize the cervical or thoracic&#xD;
        vertebral column and are unable to fit in the safety harness without increased risk of&#xD;
        injury are not eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
        C) Patients will also be excluded if they are unable to tolerate 10 minutes of standing&#xD;
        without orthostasis (decrease in blood pressure by 20 mmHg systolic and 10 mmHg diastolic);&#xD;
        previous experience in the sub-acute population suggests that 10 minutes of standing is&#xD;
        more than sufficient for tolerating 45 minutes of walking secondary to increased&#xD;
        activity/muscle pump minimizing risk for orthostasis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        D) Women who are pregnant or who are considering becoming pregnant will be excluded due to&#xD;
        the trunk and pelvis restraints required for use during locomotion, and secondary to the&#xD;
        unknown effects of the pharmacological agents on the developing fetus.&#xD;
&#xD;
        E) Subjects with height and weight limitations which restrict participation in Lokomat&#xD;
        Training(LT) will be excluded. For height, subjects who are &gt; 78 inches or &lt; 60 inches tall&#xD;
        may present with thigh/shank lengths that may limit use of the Lokomat. If subjects are not&#xD;
        able to step independently on the treadmill and require use of robotic-assistance during&#xD;
        treadmill stepping, attempts to fit all subjects in the robotic orthosis prior to&#xD;
        enrollment and randomization. For weight, the maximum weight limit for use of the safety&#xD;
        harness/counterweight system is 300 lbs.&#xD;
&#xD;
        F) Individuals with concurrent severe medical illness, including unhealed decubiti,&#xD;
        existing infection, significant cardiovascular or metabolic disease which limits exercise&#xD;
        participation, significant osteoporosis (as indicated by history of fractures following&#xD;
        injury), active heterotrophic ossification in the lower extremities, known history of&#xD;
        peripheral nerve injury in lower legs, history of known traumatic head injury, and history&#xD;
        of pulmonary complications, including significant obstructive and/or restrictive lung&#xD;
        diseases will be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
        G) Patients prescribed other anti-depressant medications, including specific monoaminergic&#xD;
        agents, their precursors or their agonists, or other medications with known interactions to&#xD;
        the SSRIs or TIZ will be excluded. With consultation and supervision of the patients'&#xD;
        physician and the attending physicians for each individual patient, subjects will be&#xD;
        required to wean of their medications on an appropriate and safe dosing schedule to&#xD;
        minimize side effects of drug cessation or withdrawal. All subjects will be excluded from&#xD;
        participation unless both attending physician and patient agree to cease all such&#xD;
        medications during the evaluation and training period. A 14-day washout period for SSRIs&#xD;
        and a 72 hour washout for TIZ will be utilized.&#xD;
&#xD;
        H) All subjects prescribed anti-spastic medications will be excluded. Specific agents to be&#xD;
        excluded include baclofen (Lioresal®) and benzodiazepines (Diazepam®). Selected agents used&#xD;
        for pain modulation will be evaluated per subject to ascertain potential interactions with&#xD;
        test agent. With consultation and supervision of the patients' physician and the attending&#xD;
        physicians for each individual patient, subjects will be required to wean of their&#xD;
        medications on an appropriate and safe dosing schedule to minimize side effects of drug&#xD;
        cessation or withdrawal. All subjects will be excluded from participation unless both&#xD;
        attending physician and patient agree to cease all such medications during the evaluation&#xD;
        and training period. A 72-hour minimum washout period for all such medications will be&#xD;
        utilized. (Note: exception to use of TIZ during training - see above).&#xD;
&#xD;
        I) Women of childbearing potential will not be excluded, although women who are pregnant or&#xD;
        who are considering becoming pregnant will be excluded due to the trunk and pelvis&#xD;
        restraints required for use during locomotion, and secondary to the unknown effects of the&#xD;
        test agent (SSRIs) on the developing fetus. Women who use oral contraceptives will not be&#xD;
        assessed for TIZ experiments and will be excluded from Aim 1.&#xD;
