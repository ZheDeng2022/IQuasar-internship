  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The laparoscopic adjustable gastric band (LAGB) is a safe and effective surgical intervention&#xD;
      for chronically obese patients who have exhausted all non-surgical weight loss treatments.&#xD;
      Numerous published studies have confirmed both the safety and efficacy of the LAGB and its&#xD;
      beneficial impact on obesity-associated conditions, such as type 2 diabetes, joint and back&#xD;
      pain and hypertension. The A.M.I. Protector Band is a modification of an existing gastric&#xD;
      band (the A.M.I. Soft Gastric Band) which has been in use since 2001 and which has been shown&#xD;
      to be both safe and effective. The specific design modification is in the form of a section&#xD;
      of mesh, which provides support to the gastric pouch and which further restricts food portion&#xD;
      sizes. The expectation is that this will deliver optimal weight loss whilst having the&#xD;
      maximum possible impact on obesity-associated conditions such as type 2 diabetes and&#xD;
      hypertension. In the longer term, there is also the possibility that the Protector Band will&#xD;
      reduce the incidence of band complications such as slippage and dilatation (or stretching) of&#xD;
      the gastric pouch. In this study we will recruit approximately 200 patients who will then&#xD;
      undergo surgical implantation of the A.M.I. Protector Band. The study participants will then&#xD;
      be followed for a period of 3-years, during which time we will record weight loss, changes in&#xD;
      co-morbid conditions such as diabetes and the incidence of band complications, including&#xD;
      slippage and pouch dilatation.&#xD;

      Where patients express an interest in the A.M.I. Protector Band, they will be given a Patient&#xD;
      Information Sheet which will form the basis of a discussion with the attending physician.&#xD;
      Patients opting for the Protector Band will be told that their anonymised clinical data will&#xD;
      be stored in a secure database and used for research purposes. They will also be required to&#xD;
      attend for regular follow-up (see below) for a period of three years after implantation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following this initial consultation, a minimum period of 2-weeks will be required before the&#xD;
      patient is listed for surgery. This will provide a suitable period during which the patient&#xD;
      can consider the options and seek clarification on any points about which they are unclear.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the case of the A.M.I. Protector Band the surgery will be performed in two locations:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Spire Hospital Parkway (Birmingham)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Spire Hospital Manchester&#xD;
&#xD;
      All band procedures will be performed by one of two surgeons; Mr. Paul Super and Prof. Franco&#xD;
      Favretti according to a standard protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In all cases, informed consent will be obtained prior to surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will remain in hospital overnight and be discharged the following day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On discharge, patients will be given comprehensive written instructions regarding optimal&#xD;
      nutritional and physical activity. They will also be provided with a 24-hour, Emergency&#xD;
      Helpline number in the event of problems.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will be followed for a period of three years, with a formal review at 5 weeks&#xD;
      and then at 3, 6, 9, 12, 18, 24 and 36 months. However, patients will be free to attend&#xD;
      additional clinics between the formal reviews should they wish. At each visit the patient's&#xD;
      weight, height, waist/hip ratio and blood pressure (BP) will be recorded. In addition, a&#xD;
      range of blood tests will be carried out at baseline, at 12, 24 and 36 months. A&#xD;
      self-administered Quality of Life questionnaire will be completed prior to surgery and then&#xD;
      at 12, 24 and 36 months of follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the completion of the 3-year study, patients will be able to transition into our usual&#xD;
      care gastric band programme for long-term follow-up.&#xD;
