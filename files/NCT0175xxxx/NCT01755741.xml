  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This trial will assess the potential impact of a vaginal ring on condom use by comparing the&#xD;
      performance (total clinical failure, clinical slippage, and clinical breakage) of a standard&#xD;
      male lubricated latex condom when the female partner is wearing the vaginal ring and when the&#xD;
      female partner is not wearing the vaginal ring.&#xD;
