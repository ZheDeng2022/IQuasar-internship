  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Recently, researchers have been interested in the use of game play, mechanics and psychology&#xD;
      for health-related engagement and behavior change. While initial studies have shown some&#xD;
      increases in health knowledge and/or behavior through gaming, there remains concern that the&#xD;
      vehicle for change is associated with a perceived sedentary behavior (6).&#xD;
&#xD;
      More recently, commercially available gaming devices are able to directly promote physical&#xD;
      activity through a new set of &quot;kinetic controllers&quot; added to the gaming experience. UHG plans&#xD;
      to evaluate the most recent of these kinetic controller technologies in the context of a&#xD;
      second iteration of JOIN (described above) to be implemented among a pilot group of&#xD;
      overweight and/or obese children whose BMI percentile is above the 85th.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will evaluate the effect of a commercial controller-free Exercise Gaming and&#xD;
      Entertainment Experience (EGEE) on physical activity levels in the context of a weight&#xD;
      management program in approximately 70 children ages 6 to12. The study will compare the&#xD;
      differences in physical activity levels over 16 weeks in two groups of children.&#xD;

      The Center for Health Reform and Modernization at UHG will compare levels of physical&#xD;
      activity, assessed by accelerometry, among children randomly assigned to WMA or WM+E groups.&#xD;
      Specific aims of this evaluation are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Compare the two groups on changes in the daily minutes of physical activity (mild,&#xD;
           moderate and vigorous) after sessions 1, 8 and 15, respectively (Sessions are typically&#xD;
           one week a part. Due to holiday schedules, there may be a lapse of two weeks between&#xD;
           sessions).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Compare the two groups on changes in the daily minutes of sedentary behavior after&#xD;
           sessions 1, 8 and 15, respectively&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Compare the two groups on changes in relative weight (weight, BMI percentile, BMI&#xD;
           z-score) at sessions 1, 8, and 16 weeks, respectively&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Compare the two groups on measures of program satisfaction at 1, 8, and 16 weeks,&#xD;
           respectively&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participation in the post session one session is required in order to be eligible for the&#xD;
      study requirements include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A signed consent/ assent from the parent and child.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The child must be able to participate in physical activity similar to exercise gaming&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The family must have a TV/monitor that supports Microsoft Kinect&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The family must have internet connection in the home&#xD;
&#xD;
      The family's decision to participate in the study does not affect the child's'/ parent's&#xD;
      overall ability to fully participate in the JOIN Program. All JOIN program materials will be&#xD;
      the same whether or not JOIN participants agree to be in the study. All aspects of the study&#xD;
      will be conducted outside of the standard class time. Interested and eligible participants&#xD;
      will be scheduled to attend a study visit immediately after their first JOIN class. During&#xD;
      that study visit, written informed consent/assent from the parent/child will be obtained.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once a participant has agreed to enroll and have been consented/assented he/she will be&#xD;
      informed of study group to which he/she has been randomly assigned. There are two options: 1)&#xD;
      weight management alone or 2) weight management plus exercise gaming and entertainment&#xD;
      experience. Randomization will occur at the group level (i.e., all consented/assented&#xD;
      children in the Wed at 5 p group). Classes will be randomized in pairs of 2 and based on&#xD;
      enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment JOIN consists of 16 weekly Core in-person group sessions followed by 8 monthly&#xD;
      mastery group sessions. While the JOIN Program continues for one year, the study will only&#xD;
      occur over the first 16 weeks. YMCA sessions last 75 minutes and include a weight assessment&#xD;
      of the child prior to each session. The groups are led by a YMCA facilitator. The topics for&#xD;
      the first 16 sessions are listed below.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Child Activity Monitor. At sessions 1, 8, and 15 an actigraph will be distributed to each&#xD;
      participating child in group 1 and 2. Each child will wear it for 1 week (7 days) during&#xD;
      waking hours, and return it at the next session. An activity monitor provides no feedback to&#xD;
      participants and provides an objective measure of physical activity (mild, moderate,&#xD;
      vigorous) as well as sedentary behavior through downloaded data. The GT3XE Triaxial Activity&#xD;
      Monitor w/Extended MemoryÂ® (produced by Actigraph) is a small, omni-directional accelerometer&#xD;
      (Actigraph), which has already been approved by the FDA for measuring subject's physical&#xD;
      activity, and energy expenditure level. The activity monitor (Actigraph) is a small, 1 inch&#xD;
      by 1 inch, device that is worn at the hip level attached to an adjustable belt (also provided&#xD;
      by the study). The belt can be worn below or above clothing.&#xD;
