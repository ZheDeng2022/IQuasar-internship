    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess scar-formation and wound healing following the use of&#xD;
      autologous fat grafting in facial reconstruction patients. Patients who have undergone facial&#xD;
      reconstruction in the last 3 months will be randomized into two groups, one receiving fat&#xD;
      grafting and one not receiving any intervention. These patients will continue to follow-up in&#xD;
      our clinic for one year, with 3-D images taken at each follow-up visit to assess scar&#xD;
      formation and wound healing. Assessment of the scar will be undertaken by both healthcare&#xD;
      personnel as well as general lay public. We hypothesize that patients undergoing fat grafting&#xD;
      to the wound site will achieve a more aesthetically appealing result, with less scarring and&#xD;
      improved wound healing as judged by both the general public and healthcare professionals.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A variety of local and regional skin flaps are used for reconstruction of skin defects on the&#xD;
      face with the intention of full wound closure, healing, and scar minimization. Scarring is an&#xD;
      unavoidable consequence of wound healing, especially after significant facial reconstruction.&#xD;
      Fibroblasts migrate to the injurious site where they proliferate and deposit collagen. The&#xD;
      collagenous proteins serve to fill in the wound defect and allow epithelial cells to&#xD;
      accumulate and repopulate the skin surface. The collagenous base is subsequently exchanged&#xD;
      for various types of collagen and is crosslinked. Although scar formation is an important&#xD;
      component of wound healing, patients develop scars differently based upon location and&#xD;
      biology of the subject. Excessive scar formation may result from excessive collagen&#xD;
      production and inadequate collagen remodeling (Gurtner).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Much effort has focused on minimizing scar formation. Such techniques have included rigorous&#xD;
      sterilization techniques, smaller, more linear incisions, and incisions that follow normal&#xD;
      tension lines in the skin to name only a few. However, these techniques have been mostly&#xD;
      limited to intraoperative or pre-operative measures. And while successful in minimizing scar&#xD;
      burden, these techniques do not address scar management post operatively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Wound healing and scar formation follow complex biological processes dependent on&#xD;
      inflammatory cells and growth factors. It has been shown in utero that fetal wounds are&#xD;
      capable of scarless healing during a phase of gestation when wounds heal with a paucity of&#xD;
      inflammatory cells (Soo, Frantz). This principle was further studied in immune deficient mice&#xD;
      lacking both macrophages and neutrophils, which are critical to the inflammatory response.&#xD;
      Within this experiment, both groups of mice (immunodeficient and normal mice) healed the&#xD;
      wounds, the immunodeficient mice did so in a scarless manner (Mori, Martin). Extrapolating&#xD;
      this information to current surgical patients, the development of an immunomodulating measure&#xD;
      is critical to inhibiting and managing scar formation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adipose derived mesenchymal stem cells (ADSCs) have been studied with regard to their role in&#xD;
      the wound healing and scar formation process and have shown great promise. In experimental&#xD;
      studies, ADSCs have shown to promote angiogenesis, granulation and reepithelialization of the&#xD;
      overlying wound (Ebrahimian). Whether directly or indirectly through these processes, the&#xD;
      ADSCs also improve the appearance of resultant scars by decreasing size, contrast of scar&#xD;
      color, and improving pliability of the scar (Blanton, Yun). However, it is not to be confused&#xD;
      that all adipose tissue is equivalent with ADSCs. Rather, ADSCs are a particular line of&#xD;
      cells found within adipose tissue that have the unique capability of differentiating into a&#xD;
      variety of types of tissues, from bone to cartilage to further adipose tissue (Zuk). These&#xD;
      cells are capable of being harvested and cultured from adipose tissue within subjects and&#xD;
      then subsequently injected into the wound site of interest.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fat grafting is a similar but less involved technique that harvests autologous adipose tissue&#xD;
      but does not use cell culture techniques to isolate ADSCs from other cell lineages. Fat&#xD;
      grafting has long been used as a technique concurrently with facial reconstruction procedures&#xD;
      and facial rejuvenation procedures as a &quot;filler&quot; of sorts for facial augmentation as early as&#xD;
      1893 (Miller). The fat injected into the face serves as a volume expander to correct defects&#xD;
      related to loss of muscle or bone, such as in micrognathia. Since those initial trials, the&#xD;
      technique has been widely expanded and honed to provide the best possible contouring. In&#xD;
      addition to the filler aspects and results of the procedure, the technique has been observed&#xD;
      to improve skin quality in injection sites, improve pigmentation irregularities, and even&#xD;
      improve appearance of long standing scars. However, a formal study of fat grafting's&#xD;
      potential of improved wound healing and minimization of scar formation has never been&#xD;
      undertaken.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although not identical to the process of injection of autologous ADSCs, the process of fat&#xD;
      grafting has the capabilities of providing some number of ADSCs that were in the adipose&#xD;
      harvest. Additionally, the process itself has been shown in the past to improve previously&#xD;
      existing scars and improve the quality of skin overlying injection sites (Coleman).&#xD;
      Therefore, it is logical to assume that injection of autologous fat will improve wound&#xD;
      healing and minimize scar formation in patients undergoing the procedure through effects of&#xD;
      ADSCs within the harvested tissue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With the advent of advanced 3-D imaging technology, we are now able to obtain high-quality,&#xD;
      high-resolution images to document and detail stages of wound healing and scar formation.&#xD;
      Therefore, we will be able to determine through observer analysis whether the process of fat&#xD;
      grafting changes the formation and quality of scars over time.&#xD;

    <description>The experimental arm of the study will be composed of 15 patients who undergo autologous fat grafting into the site of the facial reconstructive scar at 3 months post-operatively. A small amount of fat will be removed near the umbilicus through a cannula using local anesthetic and a small, 2-3mm incision just barely large enough for the cannula to pass. That fat will be injected directly under the scar site in those patients using a similar cannula, local anesthetic, and small, 2-3mm incision. No sutures will be required at either the donor or injection site. Patients will subsequently return to clinic for 3-D photographic assessment at 3, 6 and 12 months post-fat grafting. The images generated at each session will be provided to a group of assessors for evaluation. They will either use the Manchester Scar Scale or the modified Manchester Scar Scale depending on whether they are within the health care profession.</description>

They will undergo no fat-grafting but will be followed up with the same frequency as the experimental group, at 3 months, 6 months, and 12 months after their initial 3 month post-surgical follow-up. 3-D images will be taken at each appointment and will be distributed to all assessors. Assessors will use either the Manchester Scar Scale or a modified Manchester Scar Scale to evaluate the appearance of the scar at each time point.</description>
