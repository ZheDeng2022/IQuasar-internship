      Study Objectives The study is to identify prevalence, demography and clinical characteristics&#xD;
      of patients with resistant hypertension among hypertensive patients who have been treated in&#xD;
      general hospitals in Korea from Jan 2012 to Jun 2012.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Diagnosis of resistant hypertension: In case of clinic blood pressure exceeding the&#xD;
           boundary of systolic blood pressure at 140mmHg and diastolic blood pressure at 90mmHg&#xD;
           (hereinafter refer to as 140/90mmHg) (130/80mmHg for patients with diabetes mellitus or&#xD;
           chronic renal disease) despite triple antihypertensive therapy at optimal dose may be&#xD;
           diagnosed as resistant hypertension. Antihypertensive medications used include&#xD;
           diuretics. Resistant hypertension may also be diagnosed when clinic blood pressure has&#xD;
           reached the target value but quadruple or more of antihypertensives are used.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Diagnosis of controlled hypertension: Patients whose clinic blood pressure equals to&#xD;
           140/90mmHg (130/80mmHg for patients with diabetes mellitus or chronic renal disease) or&#xD;
           less with the administration of antihypertensives at optimal dose may be diagnosed as&#xD;
           controlled hypertension.&#xD;

      Primary Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prevalence in patients with resistant hypertension among hypertensive patients who have been&#xD;
      treated in Korean general hospitals&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis of correlation in patients with resistant hypertension and patients with controlled&#xD;
      hypertension who received triple antihypertensive therapy in terms of demography, clinical&#xD;
      characteristics and other factors&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Demographic data (age, sex, and body mass index)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Clinical characteristics&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Vital signs&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Lifestyles (history of drinking, smoking, and exercise)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Family history (hypertension, diabetes mellitus, dyslipidemia, cardiovascular&#xD;
                disease, renal/adrenal disease, cerebrovascular disease, and respiratory disease)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Concurrent diseases (diabetes mellitus, dyslipidemia, cardiovascular disease,&#xD;
                renal/adrenal disease, cerebrovascular disease, respiratory disease, and others)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  History of antihypertensive therapy (past and present)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Medication compliance of antihypertensives&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Concomitant medications&#xD;
