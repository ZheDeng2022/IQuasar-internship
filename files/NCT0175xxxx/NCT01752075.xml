      The REVLIMID Registry will provide safety data from a large cohort of Taiwanese patients&#xD;
      treated with REVLIMID. In addition, the registry will provide efficacy data and outcomes in a&#xD;
      real-world setting (versus a clinical trial).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>

      The REVLIMID Registry is a prospective, multi-center, observational study. The registry will&#xD;
      register 100 patients being prescribed REVLIMID in Taiwan during and patients will be&#xD;
      followed for two years after the enrollment of the last patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety and efficacy data will be recorded in the registry monthly or bi-monthly. In&#xD;
      accordance with the Risk Minimization Program for REVLIMID (RevAssure) a patient categorized&#xD;
      as a woman of childbearing potential will be prescribed REVLIMID on a monthly basis, whereas&#xD;
      women of non-childbearing potential and men will be allowed up to two months supply per&#xD;
      prescription.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After entry of baseline data, the prescribing physician should prescribe and monitor REVLIMID&#xD;
      therapy according to the guidance and recommended schedules given in the approved Taiwan&#xD;
      package insert (PI)&#xD;
