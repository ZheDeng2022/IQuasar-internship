  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Vitamin D3 supplementation reduces the incidence of multiple sclerosis.Although clinical&#xD;
      cross-sectional studies have demonstrated vitamin D3 as a positive mediator in preventing&#xD;
      relapses and disease progression, prospective randomized control trials are nevertheless&#xD;
      necessary to confirm these statements and to determine the most efficacious, safe, and the&#xD;
      minimum required doses. This hypothesis is going to be tested through a randomized triple&#xD;
      blinded controlled trial in which after randomization, one group of patients will receive&#xD;
      vitamin D and second group will receive placebo. Both groups are going to be followed in a&#xD;
      similar way over a period of one year with follow ups at 4, 8 and 12 months. Vitamin D levels&#xD;
      is going to be performed at 0,4, 12 month interval. MRI is going to be done at the beginning&#xD;
      and end of trial.The number of relapses and the physical disability will be calculated&#xD;
      through the Expanded disability status scale (EDSS).&#xD;

      Study Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To estimate the prevalence of vitamin D deficiency in Saudi Multiple Sclerosis(MS)&#xD;
           patient coming to King Khalid hospital, multiple sclerosis clinic.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To compare the difference in the relapse rate among Multiple Sclerosis patients who are&#xD;
           taking vitamin D3 (50,000 IU per week) versus those who are not taking Vitamin D3&#xD;
           supplements.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess and compare the improvement in the Expanded Disability Status scale and&#xD;
           clinical symptoms among those who are taking vitamin D3 versus those who are on placebo&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design: A single centre, triple-blinded, parallel randomized placebo controlled trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: All eligible patients with clinical definite MS will be assigned a&#xD;
      computer-generated Identification number by the statistician and through randomization&#xD;
      divided into two groups, one group receiving vitamin D3 (the intervention arm) and other&#xD;
      getting placebo (the control arm). All patients will continue with their routine&#xD;
      pre-intervention trial treatment for relapse and remission phases of multiple sclerosis. The&#xD;
      first treatment group will receive 50,000 IU units of vitamin D3 per week . The control arm&#xD;
      patients, instead of vitamin D3 will receive a placebo supplement that looks, smells and&#xD;
      tastes the same as the vitamin D3 for 52 weeks. Compliance with the study treatment will be&#xD;
      verified by asking the patients about missed doses and by counting used and unused bottles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will be asked questions related socio-demographic data, vitamin D related&#xD;
      dietary products, physical activity questions, exposure to sunlight and variation according&#xD;
      to season, use of sunscreen, body coverage when in sunlight and any previous treatment for&#xD;
      Multiple Sclerosis, including any vitamin D supplements. Every follow up visit shall include&#xD;
      documentation of complete neurologic and medical history and findings. This will be a&#xD;
      triple-blinded trial. The patient, the treating physician and the statistician will be masked&#xD;
      to the type of treatment each patient receives.Sealed envelopes containing the vitamin D3 or&#xD;
      placebo are going to be handed over to the physician with the computer assigned number of the&#xD;
      patient. At each follow-up visit all patients will be required to bring their envelopes along&#xD;
      with empty/ filled bottles to assess their compliance with the treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The treating physician will follow all the patients at set regular intervals: 0 (baseline),&#xD;
      4, 8, and 12 months to assess the relapses and the EDSS scores and also to check for any&#xD;
      adverse effects arising because of the vitamin D3 supplements. Patients who are going to miss&#xD;
      their appointment shall be contacted by the project staff to set another appointment in the&#xD;
      subsequent week. All patients are going to be emphasized about the importance of these&#xD;
      clinical visits and their compliance with the treatment. All patients will be evaluated by&#xD;
      the same treating physician.&#xD;
