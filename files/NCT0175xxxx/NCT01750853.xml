    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the safety and tolerability of LY3045697 after a&#xD;
      single dose, and to determine how long LY3045697 remains in the body. Two cohorts (groups) of&#xD;
      9 participants each will participate in 3 dosing periods. These participants will receive&#xD;
      placebo in one period only. A third cohort of 9 will participate in 2 dosing periods and&#xD;
      participants will receive either 2 dose levels of LY3045697 or 1 dose level of LY3045697 and&#xD;
      placebo by the end of both periods.&#xD;
