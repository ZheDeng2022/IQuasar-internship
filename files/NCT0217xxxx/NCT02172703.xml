      Introduction: Increased intracranial pressure (ICP) is considered to be the most important&#xD;
      intracranial mechanism causing secondary injury in patients admitted after acute traumatic&#xD;
      brain injury (TBI) and intracranial haemorrhage (ICB) including subarachnoid haemorrhage&#xD;
      (SAH). Currently, ICP can be measured and monitored only using invasive techniques. The two&#xD;
      ICP measurement methods available - intraventricular and intraparenchymal - require both a&#xD;
      neurosurgical procedure in order to implant the catheter and probes within the brain. The&#xD;
      invasiveness of current methods for ICP measurement limits the diagnoses reliability of many&#xD;
      neurological conditions in which intracranial hypertension is a treatable adverse event. A&#xD;
      reliable, accurate and precise non-invasive method to measure ICP would be of considerable&#xD;
      clinical value, enabling ICP measurement without the need of a surgical intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to validate a novel non-invasive ICP measurement device by comparing&#xD;
      its measurement with the &quot;gold standard&quot; invasive ICP-measurement by intracranial probe. The&#xD;
      device used in this study has been been developed in the Telematic Science Laboratory at the&#xD;
      Kaunas University of Technology, Lithuania.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The non-invasive ICP measurement method will be assessed prospectively using repeatable&#xD;
      simultaneous non-invasive and invasive (standard with intracranial probe) ICP measurements on&#xD;
      patients presenting with TBI and SAH. The device method is based on two-depth transcranial&#xD;
      doppler (TCD) technique for simultaneously measuring flow velocities in the intracranial and&#xD;
      extracranial segments of the ophthalmic artery (OA). The intracranial segment of the OA is&#xD;
      compressed by ICP and the extracranial segment of the OA is compressed by the pressure Pe&#xD;
      externally applied by the device. Two-depth TCD device is used as an accurate indicator of&#xD;
      the balance point (Pe = ICP) when the measured parameters of blood flow velocity waveforms in&#xD;
      the intracranial and extracranial segments of OA are identical. The device has the same&#xD;
      ultrasound transmission parameters as existing TCD devices and meets all patient safety&#xD;
      criteria.&#xD;
