    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of using ultrasound to image and&#xD;
      track pancreas/duodenum motion during radiation therapy treatment delivery. Also develop a&#xD;
      workflow and process to allow the final ultrasound system to be used routinely by radiation&#xD;
      therapists.&#xD;

      1. Acquire 2D and 3D ultrasound images for 5 pancreatic cancer patients using the existing&#xD;
           Clarity system with a hand-held probe. The visibility of pancreas, duodenum, and other&#xD;
           organs will be evaluated. Based on this image acquisition experience, design and&#xD;
           construct stands to hold the ultrasound probe. Issues to be considered in the design&#xD;
           include (i) avoiding the stand and probe blocking radiation beams, (ii) avoiding&#xD;
           ultrasound going through the ribs, (iii) minimizing the effect of respiration motion.&#xD;
           Also explore building the probe into the immobilization device (e.g., Alpha cradle) or&#xD;
           using robotic arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Acquire ultrasound images for 20 patients with pancreatic cancer treated in the&#xD;
           Department of Radiation Oncology department using the tools developed in Aim 1. As the&#xD;
           standard practice, the 4 dimensional CT (4DCT) and 4 dimensional (4D) morphological and&#xD;
           physiological MRI (T1, T2, apparent diffusion coefficient, DWI) will be acquired for&#xD;
           treatment planning, and a respiration-gated CT will be acquired immediately before the&#xD;
           delivery of each fraction using an in-room CT or cone-beam CT for patient positioning.&#xD;
           The ultrasound images may be acquired during initial simulation immediately before or&#xD;
           after the planning 4DCT and the daily gated CT, and during the treatment delivery in 2D,&#xD;
           3D and/or 4D modes. All raw ultrasound data will be stored.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Process ultrasound data acquired above to evaluate the effectiveness of using ultrasound&#xD;
           to image and to track pancreas/duodenum motion during the treatment delivery. The images&#xD;
           will be processed to visualize pancreas and/or surrogates, such as the boundary between&#xD;
           pancreas and duodenum, infusion catheter. To improve the visible appearance,&#xD;
           elastography will be explored by processing the raw data collected in Aim 2. Existing&#xD;
           software will be used, and may be modified if necessary, to segment and to register&#xD;
           ultrasound with CT. A tool the investigators previous develop for multimodality&#xD;
           registration will be used to register ultrasound with MRI. Anatomic markers, such as the&#xD;
           boundary between pancreas head and duodenum, stent, infusion catheter, may be used for&#xD;
           registration and/or motion tracking.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Develop/modify workflow and process to allow the final system to be used routinely by&#xD;
           radiation therapists. If necessary, user-friendly software tools will be&#xD;
           developed/incorporated in the final system.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Explore the use of Doppler mode for tissue characterization and the potential of using&#xD;
           it to image radiation effects.&#xD;
