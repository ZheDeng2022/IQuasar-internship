      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      â€¢ To assess the rate of conception, in female infertility, after individualized homoeopathic&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Need for the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To confirm that homeopathy is best alternative for resource limited community to receive&#xD;
           effective treatment with minimum possible expenditure.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To bring out a repertoire of effective Homoeopathic medicines in the treatment of&#xD;
           infertility.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To establish a centre for focussed treatment of infertility at Father Muller Homeopathic&#xD;
           Medical College and Hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Many cases visiting Homoeopathic OPD have improved under the treatment. In general, there is&#xD;
      a deficit of well-designed, randomized, controlled trials to evaluate the efficacy and safety&#xD;
      of complementary and alternative medicine for these indications, which makes it difficult to&#xD;
      provide evidence-based recommendations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Globally there is a need for this study to avoid the side-effects of antibiotics and hormonal&#xD;
      tablets thus improving the quality of life. In a third world country like India where&#xD;
      infertile females cannot afford surgery; Homoeopathic medicines are simple, safe and cost&#xD;
      effective. Homoeopathy can treat the underlying cause of female infertility in these cases&#xD;
      and thereby prevent the hazards of surgery. In India the female race is always targeted and&#xD;
      blamed for being infertile. This not only has an impact on the health of the woman but also&#xD;
      affects her social status. The psychological and mental agony suffered by these infertile&#xD;
      women and the fear that their husbands' may go in for a second marriage in turn causes great&#xD;
      stress and anxiety. Hence the efficacy of Homoeopathic medicines on infertile females needs&#xD;
      to be explored.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Approach: This is a prospective study with purposive sampling. Design: Total number of&#xD;
      beneficiaries is 40, including 20 PCOS cases, 10 cases of Endometriosis, and 10 cases of&#xD;
      Chronic Pelvic Inflammatory diseases. The numbers of these cases are based on the&#xD;
      availability and frequency of their visits to our OPD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection instruments: case books of the OPD Setting: OPD of Homeopathic Medical&#xD;
      College, Derlakatte, Kankanady and Thumbe Population: women visiting the OPD for infertility&#xD;
      treatment Sample: women diagnosed for any of the three causes of infertility Sampling&#xD;
      technique: purposive sampling Feasibility: the study is feasible in terms of availability of&#xD;
      patients at our OPD settings Duration of study: total of 3 years. All 40 cases are expected&#xD;
      to be registered in a span of 6 months to 1 year. Registration will be followed by treatment&#xD;
      of 18 months, 6 months for analysis and reporting by the end of 3 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis: Data from the sample is collected and subjected to chi square test, and&#xD;
      frequencies will be calculated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Null Hypothesis: No significant difference in cases of female infertility before and after&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Alternate Hypothesis: Significant difference in cases of female infertility before and after&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedure:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Forty infertile women will undergo investigations like Ultrasonography of pelvis, diagnostic&#xD;
      laparoscopy when needed and urine pregnancy test once in six months. The cases will be&#xD;
      diagnosed by the principal investigators and co-investigators. Semen analysis in male&#xD;
      partners will be done as a routine to rule out cases of male infertility. The infertile women&#xD;
      will be administered appropriate Homoeopathic Simillimum by the principal investigator for 18&#xD;
      months. The follow-up visits of these patients will be once in two weeks. Effectiveness of&#xD;
      Homoeopathic treatment and rate of conception in infertile females will be assessed after&#xD;
      administering the Simillimum. The investigations will be repeated after treatment and cases&#xD;
      will be reviewed and examined by the co-investigators.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The treatment given is individually chosen homoeopathic medicine based on the psychophysical&#xD;
      symptom syndrome each experienced. The drugs are procured from Fr Muller HPD which complies&#xD;
      with the standards of Homoeopathic Pharmacopoeia. The investigations will be repeated after&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Homoeopathic treatment includes a detailed interview in which the patient is queried&#xD;
      about her unique symptoms. The well indicated constitutional remedy will be given on the&#xD;
      basis of symptoms' similarity, that is, symptoms that were in emotional and mental realm and&#xD;
      those that affected her entire body. The symptoms will be ordered by intensity and&#xD;
      prominence. A single dose of Homoeopathic Similimum will be given to each of these patients&#xD;
      and repeated as and when needed and whenever required the potency will be increased. If there&#xD;
      is any miasmatic block, anti-miasmatic treatment will be given. Acute remedy will be given&#xD;
      when needed. All cases of infertility are told to abstain from caffeine and Allopathic&#xD;
      treatment. Hormonal treatment is to be withdrawn. The investigations will be repeated after&#xD;
      treatment after six months, twelve months and eighteen months whenever required to assess the&#xD;
      improvement of the patient.&#xD;
