  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to develop an accurate and useful way of measuring older&#xD;
      patients' moods and reactions to the combined issue of cancer treatment and aging. Also, the&#xD;
      purpose of this study is to test a new self-report measure of depressive symptoms tailored to&#xD;
      the needs of older adults with cancer. Findings from this research will help us develop&#xD;
      improved methods of diagnosis and treatment.&#xD;

    <description>This protocol aims to design, develop and pilot test a psychometric assessment for depression in older cancer patients. The study is divided in three phases. In Phase 1, approximately 15 depressed patients (as determined clinically) and approximately 15 non-depressed patients will undergo individual interviews. In Phase 2, the team will use the themes and subthemes obtained in Phase 1 to write a set of indicators into questionnaire form. In Phase 3, the newly developed questionnaire will be given to a sample of approximately 150 cancer patients who meet the eligibility criteria. Survey results obtained from this sample of 150 patients will be used to assess internal consistency, conduct item analysis, and determine the unique content of the proposed instrument.</description>

    <description>10-16 patients will review draft items and participate in a cognitive interview. 15 older patients will complete the draft measure in order to generate preliminary psychometric data. All interviews will be audio recorded and transcribed by Ubiqus Transcription Company. The audio recordings are uploaded through Ubiqus's secure server and the transcribed audio is returned to the research staff within 48 hours.</description>

    <description>The draft measure (approximately 35 items, described above) will be administered to a large sample of older cancer patients (n=150) to generate data to evaluate preliminary psychometric properties (item properties including measures of central tendency, skewness/kurtosis, internal consistency, test/re-test reliability, and construct validity (i.e, convergent and discriminant).and known group differences) to further winnow the measure to include approximately 20 items.</description>
