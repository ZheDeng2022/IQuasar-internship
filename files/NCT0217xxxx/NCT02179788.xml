  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Most new mothers in the United States will start off breastfeeding. For some mothers, despite&#xD;
      following best practices, they are not able to meet their breastfeeding goals due to&#xD;
      unexplained low milk supply. At the same time, nearly 1 in 4 new mothers are pre-diabetic&#xD;
      (elevated blood sugar, but not yet diabetic). My progression of research suggests that the&#xD;
      same metabolic factors causing pre-diabetes may also be causing low milk supply. Metformin is&#xD;
      a widely prescribed drug to treat high blood sugar. This study is a preliminary, small scale&#xD;
      randomized trial designed to test for a trend in the hypothesis that metformin is safe and&#xD;
      potentially effective in treating low milk supply in insulin resistant and pre-diabetic&#xD;
      mothers.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Through a progression of research, the PI has developed the central hypothesis that waning&#xD;
      insulin secretion in the context of insulin resistance is an important cause of low milk&#xD;
      supply. The specific aim of the research described in this protocol is to enact a small-scale&#xD;
      randomized placebo-controlled trial (RCT) that will inform a future larger double-masked RCT&#xD;
      of adjuvant metformin treatment versus placebo for early postpartum low milk supply in women&#xD;
      with evidence of insulin resistance based on the presence of at least one of the following:&#xD;
      elevated fasting glucose (FPG, defined as &gt;95 g/dL), history of polycystic ovary syndrome,&#xD;
      history of gestational diabetes, or current abdominal obesity. The pilot study is designed to&#xD;
      demonstrate feasibility, obtain variance estimates, and test for an trend in the following&#xD;
      primary hypothesis: 1) Among eligible women with low milk supply, those randomly assigned to&#xD;
      4 weeks of metformin treatment will experience a greater increase in milk output as compared&#xD;
      to the placebo group. The RCT will be preceded by a&quot;process testing phase&quot; in which&#xD;
      recruitment and data collection logistics will be confirmed by enacting the study protocol,&#xD;
      except without any drug assignment. Upon completion of the process testing phase, the&#xD;
      protocol will be amended according to insights gained. Once the revised protocol received IRB&#xD;
      approval, the RCT phase will begin. During this phase, mothers meeting Stage 1 eligibility&#xD;
      criteria will undergo baseline measurements of cardio-metabolic health and breast milk&#xD;
      output. Among mothers meeting stage 2 eligibility criteria, including FPG &gt;95 g/dL, N=30 will&#xD;
      be randomly assigned to metformin or placebo using a 2:1 allocation, with replacement of&#xD;
      non-completers. All low milk supply participants will receive the standard guidance for&#xD;
      increasing milk supply with breast pumping. We will test the following secondary hypotheses:&#xD;
      2) Mammary epithelial cell transcriptomes within the metformin group, but not placebo, will&#xD;
      exhibit significantly greater modulation of insulin-stimulated genes between baseline and&#xD;
      post treatment. Milk fat globules are a rich source of mammary epithelial cell mRNA. We will&#xD;
      isolate milk fat RNA at baseline and post treatment and randomly select a subset for&#xD;
      RNA-sequencing. 3) Fasting plasma glucose &gt;95 g/dL will correctly identify low milk supply&#xD;
      cases with &gt;75% sensitivity; and &lt;95 g/dL will correctly identify abundant milk supply&#xD;
      (comparator group) with &gt;90% specificity. Fasting plasma glucose (FPG) in women with abundant&#xD;
      milk supply will be derived from 30 consecutively consenting breastfeeding medicine patients&#xD;
      who meet all RCT eligibility criteria except low milk supply (i.e., diagnoses related to&#xD;
      infant feeding at the breast such as poor latch, but with abundant milk output). We will&#xD;
      combine all available baseline FPG data to determine the sensitivity and specificity of FPG&#xD;
      &gt;95 g/dL as biomarker of low milk supply caused by maternal metabolic impairment. 4)&#xD;
      Metformin treatment will be safe and adequately tolerated by the lactating mother and her&#xD;
      breastfeeding infant.&#xD;
