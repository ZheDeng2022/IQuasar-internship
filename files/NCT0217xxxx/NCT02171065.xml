  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The present study has two components, an overall prospective observational study using&#xD;
      multimodality imaging (PROSPECT II) that will examine the natural history of patients with&#xD;
      unstable atherosclerotic coronary artery disease with the specific goal to establish the&#xD;
      utility of low-risk intracoronary imaging modalities, IVUS and NIRS, to identify plaques&#xD;
      prone to future rupture and clinical events. The randomized PROSPECT ABSORB substudy will&#xD;
      examine whether treatment of vulnerable plaques with the Absorb Bioresorbable vascular&#xD;
      scaffold (BVS) plus GDMT safely increases the minimum lumen area (MLA) at 24 months compared&#xD;
      with GDMT alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The cutoff for inclusion in PROSPECT ABSORB will be a site-determined PB ≥65% (rather than&#xD;
      the 70% cutoff identified in the original PROSPECT analysis (Stone et al., New England&#xD;
      Journal of Medicine, 2011(5)) to account for an observed tendency for sites to underestimate&#xD;
      plaque burden during acute treatment of ACS patients. Nonetheless, in PROSPECT, a core&#xD;
      laboratory determined PB ≥65% was also associated with a high (7.0%) rate of major adverse&#xD;
      cardiac event (MACE) during 3-year follow-up, a rate which may be reduced with a&#xD;
      bioresorbable scaffold.&#xD;

      Methodology:&#xD;
&#xD;
      PROSPECT II: Multicenter, prospective, natural history study of troponin positive patients&#xD;
      with acute coronary syndromes (ACS) examined with angiography and intended for PCI for the&#xD;
      initial culprit lesion(s). Prior to PCI all target lesions (those lesions for which PCI is&#xD;
      planned) will be examined (if possible) by IVUS/NIRS. After successful PCI of all&#xD;
      flow-limiting lesions determined angiographically and/or by FFR/iFR intended to be treated&#xD;
      (termed &quot;culprit lesions,&quot; whether responsible for the original ACS or otherwise&#xD;
      flow-limiting and requiring PCI for complete revascularization), intravascular ultrasound&#xD;
      (IVUS), and intracoronary near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) will be performed over a 6-10 cm&#xD;
      length in all three coronary arteries with a combined IVUS/NIRS catheter. Clinical and&#xD;
      register follow-up will identify all new coronary events, the origin of which will be&#xD;
      determined by follow-up angiography when clinically indicated. These lesions will be&#xD;
      identified and compared to the baseline examination at a central angiographic and IVUS/NIRS&#xD;
      core laboratory, and adjudicated to have arisen from either originally treated culprit&#xD;
      lesions or untreated &quot;non-culprit lesions.&quot; This will allow determination of the baseline&#xD;
      patient-related and lesion-related variables in culprit and non-culprit lesions that increase&#xD;
      the risk for future unanticipated cardiovascular events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PROSPECT ABSORB (Randomized Trial): Patients with angiographically non-obstructive lesions&#xD;
      that are not intended to undergo PCI based on the current standard of care, and that are&#xD;
      site-assessed by IVUS to have plaque burden of ≥65% (which has previously been shown in the&#xD;
      first PROSPECT study to identify lesions at high risk of causing future coronary events&#xD;
      despite their non-obstructive angiographic appearance) will be randomized (1:1) to treatment&#xD;
      with ABSORB BVS + guideline directed medical therapy (GDMT) versus GDMT alone. All such&#xD;
      randomized patients will undergo repeat angiography and IVUS/NIRS after 25 months of&#xD;
      follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient enrollment and procedure overview:&#xD;
&#xD;
      PROSPECT II: Patients with a troponin positive ACS within the prior 4 weeks (STEMI &gt;12 hours&#xD;
      or NSTEMI) in whom coronary angiography is planned will be screened and asked to participate&#xD;
      in the study. After informed consent has been obtained and prior to PCI, all target lesions&#xD;
      (those lesions for which PCI is planned) will be examined (if possible) by IVUS/NIRS. If the&#xD;
      patient is successfully treated with PCI of all intended culprit lesions without major&#xD;
      procedural complication(s), all three coronary arteries will be examined with IVUS/NIRS. The&#xD;
      IVUS results will be visible (unblinded) to the operator, but the NIRS data will be blinded.&#xD;
      The patient will be considered formally enrolled in PROSPECT II only after PCI of all&#xD;
      intended target culprit lesions has been successfully completed with no major&#xD;
      complication(s), and after the study imaging catheter is passed out of the guide catheter&#xD;
      into a coronary artery (n = approximately 900 patients). If a staged procedure is required to&#xD;
      achieve revascularization of all intended lesions, the patient will not be enrolled until&#xD;
      after the staged procedure has been performed without major procedural complication(s). Once&#xD;
      enrolled, IVUS and NIRS will be performed over a 6-10 cm length in all three coronary&#xD;
      arteries with a combined IVUS/NIRS catheter to assess both the treated culprit lesion(s) and&#xD;
      long segments of the untreated coronary tree. Patient enrollment and 3-vessel IVUS and NIRS&#xD;
      imaging may be performed either in the same procedure during which the culprit PCI lesion(s)&#xD;
      are treated, or during a subsequent angiographic procedure as long as this occurs within 4&#xD;
      weeks of the initial ACS presentation, and after successful and uncomplicated treatment of&#xD;
      all target lesions. If the imaging catheter passed into a coronary artery for imaging a&#xD;
      non-culprit segment of the coronary tree and no non-culprit segment imaging data is obtained&#xD;
      (e.g. the catheter fails and a second catheter is not used), the patient will be disenrolled&#xD;
      (discontinued) from the study, and only be followed up for safety purposes for 30 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PROSPECT ABSORB: Patients in whom one or more lesions are identified with (a) an&#xD;
      angiographically visually estimated diameter stenosis of &lt;70%; (b) a visually estimated&#xD;
      reference vessel diameter (RVD) of 2.5 - 4.0 mm; (c) a visually estimated lesion length ≤50&#xD;
      mm; d) a site determined IVUS PB ≥65%; and (e) is located at least 10 mm from a previous&#xD;
      stent and at least 10 mm of intervening segment between the previous stent and the&#xD;
      non-culprit lesion does not have PB &gt;50% will be enrolled in the PROSPECT ABSORB trial and&#xD;
      randomized 1:1 to treatment with ABSORB BVS + GDMT versus GDMT alone (n = approximately 300&#xD;
      patients, 150 patients in each group). For patients with multiple qualifying lesions, a&#xD;
      single lesion will be selected for randomization prior to assignment to BVS + GDMT versus&#xD;
      GDMT alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study follow-up:&#xD;
&#xD;
      PROSPECT II (Natural History Study)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical follow-up:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be followed in the Scandinavian quality registers (eg, SWEDEHEART). Patients&#xD;
      will undergo follow-up through register data collection and by calls by study coordinators at&#xD;
      1 month (30 days), 6 months (180 days), 12 months, and 24 months, assessing MACE and safety&#xD;
      parameters. MACE will be followed in all patients throughout the whole study period until&#xD;
      last patient has been followed for 24 months. Patients will then undergo follow-up through&#xD;
      register data collection at yearly intervals starting at 3 years and through 15 years.&#xD;
      Additional phone follow-up to patients may also be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PROSPECT ABSORB (Randomized Trial)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical follow-up:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be followed in the Scandinavian quality registers (eg, SWEDEHEART). Patients&#xD;
      will undergo follow-up through register data collection and by calls by study coordinators at&#xD;
      1 month (30 days), 6 months (180 days), 12 months, and 24 months. MACE will be followed in&#xD;
      all patients throughout the whole study period until last patient has been followed for 24&#xD;
      months. Patients will then undergo follow-up through register data collection at yearly&#xD;
      intervals starting at 3 years and through 15 years, with additional phone follow-up subject&#xD;
      to Executive Committee approval.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Angiographic follow-up:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients randomized in PROSPECT-ABSORB will undergo routine angiographic and 3-vessel&#xD;
      IVUS/NIRS follow-up at 25 months; ie, 1 month after the 24 month telephone follow-up. The 25&#xD;
      month angiogram may be performed within a window of between 24.5 months and 28 months after&#xD;
      enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Note: 25-month angiographic follow-up will not be required in PROSPECT-ABSORB randomized&#xD;
      patients who either a) have had scaffold thrombosis or in-scaffold restenosis (DS&gt;50% as&#xD;
      determined by the angiographic core laboratory) at any time point prior to 25 months, OR b)&#xD;
      have had a repeat angiogram ≥12 months after enrollment and in whom IVUS/NIRS of the&#xD;
      randomized target lesion was performed.&#xD;

&#xD;
          4. Refractory ventricular arrhythmias (e.g. ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation)&#xD;
             requiring either intravenous pharmacologic treatment or defibrillation during the&#xD;

&#xD;
        PROSPECT ABSORB&#xD;
&#xD;
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        if one or more eligible lesions are identified which meet all of the following angiographic&#xD;
        criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. The lesion is a de novo lesion (may be located in either the target or non-target&#xD;
             vessel)&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. The lesion has an angiographic diameter stenosis &lt;70%, and is not intended for&#xD;
             revascularization based on angiographic criteria and Fractional Flow&#xD;
             Reserve/Instantaneous wave-free ratio (FFR/iFR).&#xD;
&#xD;
             Note: FFR/iFR should be performed on all noncritical lesions of greater than 40%&#xD;
             visually estimated angiographic stenosis that are candidates for the ABSORB substudy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. The lesion has a site-determined IVUS plaque burden in at least one frame ≥65%. Note:&#xD;
             Such a lesion may or may not be angiographically evident; i.e. the visually estimated&#xD;
             angiographic diameter stenosis may range between 0% - &lt;70%.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. The reference vessel diameter of an eligible lesion is ≥2.5 mm - ≤4.0 mm (visually&#xD;
             estimated) capable of being treated with a 2.5 mm, 3.0 mm, or 3.5 mm diameter BVS.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. The lesion length of an eligible lesion is ≤50 mm (visually estimated), capable of&#xD;
             being treated by no more than two BVS (maximum length of each BVS 28 mm), allowing for&#xD;
             2 mm BVS overlap and 2 mm of &quot;normal&quot; reference segment treatment at each edge.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. The lesion must be at least 10 mm from a previously implanted stent/scaffold and an&#xD;
             intervening 10 mm segment must not have plaque burden (PB) &gt;50%&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. A bifurcation lesion may be enrolled only if the side branch is a) ≤2.5 mm in&#xD;
             reference vessel diameter, AND b) has either no lesion requiring treatment, or&#xD;
             atherosclerotic disease limited to within 5 mm of its origin from the parent vessel&#xD;
             such that the operator believes that the side branch can be successfully treated with&#xD;
             balloon angioplasty only (without a stent). If a stent subsequently becomes necessary,&#xD;
             only a metallic drug-eluting stent (DES) may be used to treat the side branch with a&#xD;
             T-stent technique.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Randomization must occur immediately after the 3-vessel imaging run in the PROSPECT II&#xD;
             protocol. If the patient randomizes to BVS, BVS placement must be performed&#xD;
             immediately after randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. The randomized lesion cannot be within 10 mm of a lesion previously treated by PCI .&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. The randomized lesion may not be in the left main coronary artery.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. The randomized lesion may not be an ostial Left Anterior Descending Coronary Artery&#xD;
             (LAD) or ostial Left Circumflex Coronary Artery (LCX) lesion (defined as within 3 mm&#xD;
             of the left main coronary artery).&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. The randomized lesion may not be an ostial Right Coronary Artery (RCA) lesion (defined&#xD;
             as within 3 mm of the aorto-ostium).&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Angiographic evidence of severe calcification and/or marked tortuosity of the target&#xD;
             vessel and/or lesion intended for randomization is present that would make it unlikely&#xD;
             that the BVS could be advanced to or across the lesion or be adequately expanded.&#xD;
