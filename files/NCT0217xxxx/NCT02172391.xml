        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  All patients must have a diagnosis of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Male or female patients ≥ 40 years of age but ≤ 75 years old&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have a smoking history of more than ten pack-years. A pack-year is&#xD;
             defined as the equivalent of smoking one pack of cigarettes per day for a year&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must be able to perform all specified procedures and maintain records during&#xD;
             the study period as required in the protocol&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must be able to inhale medication from the HandiHaler®&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  All patients must sign a Patient Informed Consent Form prior to participation in the&#xD;
             trial i.e., prior to pre-study washout of their usual pulmonary medications&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must be willing to attend an outpatient clinic on a regular basis&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must be able to walk 164 feet (50 meters) during the Six Minute Walk Test&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with significant diseases other than COPD will be excluded. A significant&#xD;
             disease is defined as a disease which in the opinion of the investigator may either&#xD;
             put the patient at risk because of participation in the study or a disease which may&#xD;
             influence the results of the study or the patient's ability to participate in the&#xD;
             study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with clinically significant abnormal baseline haematology, blood chemistry or&#xD;
             urinalysis test results, if the abnormality defines a disease listed as an exclusion&#xD;
             criterion&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with a serum glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase (SGOT) ≥1.5 x Upper Limit of&#xD;
             Normal Range (ULN), serum glutamic-pyruvic transaminase (SGPT) ≥1.5 x ULN, bilirubin&#xD;
             ≥1.5 x ULN or creatinine ≥ 1.5 x ULN regardless of the clinical condition&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with a recent history (i.e., one year or less) of myocardial infarction&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with a recent history (i.e., three years or less) of heart failure, pulmonary&#xD;
             edema or patients with any cardiac arrhythmia (with or without symptoms)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with regular use of daytime oxygen therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with known active tuberculosis&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with a history of cancer within the last five years. Patients with treated&#xD;
             basal cell carcinoma are allowed&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with a history of life-threatening pulmonary obstruction, or a history of&#xD;
             cystic fibrosis or bronchiectasis&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have undergone thoracotomy with pulmonary resection. Patients with a&#xD;

             criterion no. 1&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with upper respiratory tract infection in the past six weeks prior to the&#xD;
             Screening Visit or during the baseline period&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with known hypersensitivity to anticholinergic drugs, lactose or any other&#xD;
             components of the inhalation capsule delivery system&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Patients who are being treated with cromolyn sodium or nedocromil sodium&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who are being treated with antihistamines (H1 receptor antagonists) or&#xD;
             antileukotrienes and are not able to stop these medications 1 month before visit 1&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients using oral corticosteroid medication at unstable doses (i.e., less than six&#xD;
             weeks on a stable dose) or at a dose in excess of the equivalent of 10 mg of&#xD;
             prednisone per day or 20 mg every other day&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant or nursing women or women of childbearing potential not using a medically&#xD;
             approved means of contraception&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with a history of asthma, allergic rhinitis or atopy or who have a total&#xD;
             blood eosinophil count ≥ 600/mm3&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Patients who have taken an investigational drug within one month or six half lives&#xD;
             (whichever is greater) prior to Screening Period (Visit 1)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have participated in any pulmonary rehabilitation program for COPD within&#xD;
             6 weeks prior to Visit 1 or throughout the study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Limitation of exercise performance as a result of factors other than fatigue or&#xD;
             exertional dyspnea such as arthritis in the leg, angina or claudication&#xD;
