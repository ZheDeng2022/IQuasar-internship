      The purpose of this study is to learn about reproductive health, including fertility and&#xD;
      pregnancies, in people with vasculitis.&#xD;

      All patients enrolled in the Vasculitis Clinical Research Consortium's Contact Registry were&#xD;
      invited via email to participate in this study. The Contract Registry includes people who&#xD;
      self-identify as having one of 6 vasculitities: Wegener's Granulomatosis, Microscopic&#xD;
      Polyangiitis, Churg-Strauss Syndrome, Polyarteritis Nodosum, Takayasu's Arteritis, and Giant&#xD;
      Cell Arteritis. People voluntarily enroll in this Registry with the understanding that they&#xD;
      will receive information about clinical studies for which they might be eligible. The&#xD;
      introductory email included basic information about the study and all of the required&#xD;
      elements for informed consent in a brief format. By clicking the link to the reproductive&#xD;
      health questionnaire, participants gave their consent to be included in the study.&#xD;

        All patients with vasculitis included in the VCRC Contact Registry were invited to&#xD;
        participate. Data was included for all patients who provided a vasculitis diagnosis,&#xD;
        estimated date of diagnosis, confirmed that the diagnosis was made by a rheumatologist, and&#xD;
        reported having taken at least one appropriate anti-rheumatic medication. Other&#xD;
        participants were excluded as the likelihood that they have a true vasculitis condition is&#xD;
        low.&#xD;
