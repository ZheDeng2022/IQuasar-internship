  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study will evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and antiretroviral&#xD;
      activity of a single dose of MK-8507 in antiretroviral therapy (ART)-naive, HIV-1 infected&#xD;
      participants. The hypothesis tested in the study is that at a safe and well-tolerated dose,&#xD;
      MK-8507 has superior antiretroviral activity to a historical placebo control, as measured by&#xD;
      change from baseline in plasma HIV-1 ribonucleic acid (RNA) at 168 hours postdose.&#xD;
