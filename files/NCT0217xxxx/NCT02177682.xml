  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Afuresertib, an AKT inhibitor, has shown in vitro and in vivo activity in multiple myeloma&#xD;
      models. AKT inhibitor has also demonstrated encouraging clinical activity in multiple&#xD;
      myeloma. This study is designed to determine the tolerability, safety, pharmacokinetics and&#xD;
      efficacy of afuresertib as monotherapy in Japanese relapsed multiple myeloma patients. This&#xD;
      is an open label, dose-escalating, phase I study. Afuresertib will be given daily until the&#xD;
      subjects meet any study treatment withdrawal criteria including disease progression. A total&#xD;
      of up to 24 subjects will be enrolled in the study.&#xD;

If afuresertib 150 mg is assessed to be tolerable, up to 6 subjects can be enrolled and given afuresertib 200 mg. If afuresertib 200 mg is assessed to be intolerable, up to 6 subjects will be enrolled and given afuresertib 150mg or 175 mg.
