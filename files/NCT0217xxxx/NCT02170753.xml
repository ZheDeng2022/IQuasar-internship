  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Purpose: The primary purpose of this study is to determine whether or not the addition of&#xD;
      thoracic, pelvic, and hip manual therapy to a standard physical therapy (PT) approach&#xD;
      consisting of motor control exercises and lumbar spine manual therapy is better than standard&#xD;
      PT alone at improving thoracolumbar spine range of motion (ROM), hip ROM, pain intensity,&#xD;
      disability level, and perceived change in patients with chronic low back pain (CLBP) and&#xD;
      movement coordination impairments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: In a CLBP subgroup with movement coordination impairments, participants receiving&#xD;
      thoracic, pelvic, and hip manual therapy with standard PT will be superior to participants&#xD;
      receiving standard PT alone at improving thoracolumbar spine ROM, hip ROM, pain intensity,&#xD;
      physical disability level, and perceived change at two, four, and 12 weeks after initiating&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;

      This study will use a 2x4 factorial mixed design with a between-factor independent variable&#xD;
      (IV) of group and a within-factor IV of time. The dependent variables include hip ROM,&#xD;
      segmental mobility of the thoracolumbar spine, pain, disability level, and patients'&#xD;
      perceived rating of change (GROC). Hip ROM and spinal mobility variables will be measured by&#xD;
      the researchers, while pain, disability level, and GROC score will be measured by&#xD;
      self-reported questionnaires.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The experimental group will receive a motor control exercise program and manual therapy to&#xD;
      the hips and spine corresponding to the individual's unique mobility impairments. The&#xD;
      comparison group will receive a motor control exercise program and manual therapy to the&#xD;
      lumbar spine only. Both groups will receive treatments at an outpatient clinic 2 times a week&#xD;
      for 4 weeks. All outcome measures will be collected at baseline (except the GROC), and then&#xD;
      at two weeks, four weeks, and twelve weeks after beginning treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All study participants will receive a motor control exercise program consistent with standard&#xD;
      of care. Exercises will be targeted to the abdominals, hip flexors, back extensors, hip&#xD;
      extensors, hip flexors, hip abductors, and hip adductors, but will begin with those muscles&#xD;
      that test weakest in the clinical exam. Generally, exercises for each subject begin with&#xD;
      isolated isometric contractions to ensure adequate motor control, and progress through&#xD;
      various degrees of agonist loading with co-contraction of synergists using isotonic open or&#xD;
      closed chain movements. Instructions to gradually increase time under tension to a maximum of&#xD;
      30 seconds for four repetitions will be used in order to provide an element of&#xD;
      graded-activity exposure and to reflect the tonic nature of stabilizing muscles. Participants&#xD;
      unable to complete all exercises by the end of the fourth week will be instructed on how to&#xD;
      progress to the final exercises with their independent home exercise program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to a motor control exercise program, all participants will receive manual therapy&#xD;
      to the lumbar spine. Standard PT manual therapy will be limited to non-thrust passive&#xD;
      accessory (PA) mobilizations from L1-L5 or soft tissue mobilization to the lumbar paraspinals&#xD;
      or quadratus lumborum. Only the participants in the experimental group will receive manual&#xD;
      therapy to the hips and thoracic spine according to the mobility impairments identified&#xD;
      during the initial testing session. The manual therapy interventions utilized at the hips and&#xD;
      thoracic spine are considered standard of care for treatment of those regions, but could be&#xD;
      considered experimental for treatment of low back pain. Regional manual therapy will include&#xD;
      a variety of thrust and non-thrust techniques targeting the thoracic, lumbopelvic, or hip&#xD;
      joints. Hip-based techniques including anterior-posterior hip mobilization, caudal thrust or&#xD;
      non-thrust mobilization, and posterior-to-anterior mobilization will be performed. The choice&#xD;
      of initiating or suspending a specific manual therapy technique and the grade of treatment&#xD;
      will be left to the discretion of the treating therapist (other than the PI). Prior to the&#xD;
      commencement of the study, all treating physical therapists will be trained in administration&#xD;
      of standard motor control exercises and manual therapy.&#xD;
