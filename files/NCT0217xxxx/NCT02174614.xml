  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators are conducting a randomized clinical trial of rapid abstinence initiation&#xD;
      and cognitive control training as a precursor to our new web-based version of the CBT4CBT&#xD;
      (Computer Based Training for Cognitive Behavioral Therapy) program to evaluate its&#xD;
      effectiveness relative to standard outpatient counseling at the Midwestern Connecticut&#xD;
      Council of Alcoholism (MCCA). CCT will be used to assess attention, working memory and&#xD;
      inhibitory control and the computer-based training program (CBT4CBT) focuses on teaching&#xD;
      basic coping skills, presenting examples of effective use of coping skills in a number of&#xD;
      realistic situations in video form, and providing opportunities for patients to practice and&#xD;
      review new skills while receiving cocaine abuse treatment.&#xD;

      150 cocaine dependent individuals will be randomly assigned to one of 3 conditions delivered&#xD;
      over 4 weeks in the context of intensive outpatient treatment. 1. Treatment as Usual (TAU),&#xD;
      2. rapid abstinence initiation (RAI) or 3. computerized cognitive control training with&#xD;
      escalating reinforcement for improved performance on training tasks (CCT). All participants&#xD;
      will then receive an 8 week trial of CBT4CBT in addition to TAU. Follow up evaluation thru 6&#xD;
      months posttreatment will assess durability and delayed emergence of treatment effects.&#xD;
