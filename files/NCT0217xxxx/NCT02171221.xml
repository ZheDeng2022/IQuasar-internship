  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a first-in-human, open label, single arm, sequential dose escalation and expansion&#xD;
      study of oral DFP-11207 in patients with advanced solid tumors.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The Phase I dose escalation portion of the study has been completed. The maximum tolerated&#xD;
      dose (MTD)/recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) has been determined. The study will now evaluate&#xD;
      the effect of food on the pharmacokinetics of DFP-11207.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The food effect study is a two-step, two-way crossover design to evaluate the&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics and bioavailability of oral DFP-11207 capsules. During Cycle 1, oral&#xD;
      DFP-11207 capsules are to be taken daily (as a single dose or twice-daily [approximately 12&#xD;
      hours apart]) under fed/fasted conditions. After Cycle 1, the food effect study will be&#xD;
      completed and patients will continue to take oral DFP-11207 capsules twice-daily&#xD;
      (approximately 12 hours apart) for 28 days of a 28-day treatment cycle.&#xD;
