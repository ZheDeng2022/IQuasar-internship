  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective is to test if acute supplementation with Coffee would improve&#xD;
      antioxidant status, following consumption of a pro-oxidative high carbohydrate, high fat meal&#xD;
      in over weight/ obese humans.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objective is to determine the ability of coffee to modify postprandial inflammation&#xD;
      in overweight/ obese humans.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The proposed study is a single-center, placebo-controlled, randomized, 2-arm, 2-sequence,&#xD;
      crossover study that characterize the bioavailability and kinetic profile of coffee over&#xD;
      6-hour postprandial day (PPD).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A planned sample size of 10 will be recruited into the study. This study will require one&#xD;
      initial screening visit, pre-study visit, and 2 PPDs. This study will take 3-6 weeks per&#xD;
      subject to complete.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The trial will initiate with a screening visit, which will last for about 1-1.5 hours where&#xD;
      the subjects' height, weight, waist circumference, fasting blood glucose, fasting hs-CRP&#xD;
      (high sensitivity C-reactive protein) concentration, blood pressure and heart rate will be&#xD;
      measured and a survey related to general eating, health and exercise habits will be&#xD;
      completed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If willing and eligible to participate, a 3-day food record (2 weekdays and 1 weekend) will&#xD;
      be given at the screening visit and collected on the following pre-study Visit to assess&#xD;
      subject's baseline dietary intake and pattern. Also, subjects will be instructed to follow a&#xD;
      relatively low polyphenolic-diet at least 7 days prior to the first PPD and for the duration&#xD;
      of the study. Prior to each PPD, a dinner meal will be provided the day before the PPD to&#xD;
      control the second meal effect from food and beverage intake of the night before the PPD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will arrive at the center in a fasting state for at least 10 hours, well hydrated&#xD;
      and rested. Each PPD will require blood draws throughout the visit. After evaluation of&#xD;
      subject's health status (via anthropometric, vital sign and blood glucose measurements and&#xD;
      in-person interview), a registered nurse will place a catheter in subject's arm for the&#xD;
      purpose of multiple blood sample collections and take the initial blood draw in the fasting&#xD;
      state. A standard high carbohydrate and high fat test meal with either 1 cup of coffee or 1&#xD;
      cup of hot water will be served. Thereafter, timers will be started and blood sample will be&#xD;
      collected at 20, 40, 60, 120, 180, 240, 300, and 360 minutes for assessment of changes in&#xD;
      inflammation markers and relative metabolic indices. The sequence of receiving the coffee or&#xD;
      hot water treatment at each visit will be randomly assigned based on computer generated&#xD;
      sequences: hot water- coffee or coffee-hot water.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Premenopausal female subjects will be studied during the follicular phase of their menstrual&#xD;
      cycle because food intake tends to be more stable during the follicular phase (days 1-13)&#xD;
      than during the luteal phase (days 14-28) when the rise in progesterone levels decrease&#xD;
      satiety and often resulting in increased intake. Both PPD visits will be placed at least 3&#xD;
      days apart as well.&#xD;
