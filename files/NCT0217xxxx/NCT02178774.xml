    <textblock>
      Hypotension after spinal anesthesia for cesarean section is one of the most common&#xD;
      perioperative issue, with an incidence up to 83%.Hypotension is mainly induced by the&#xD;
      associated sympathetic blockade, with a drop of peripheral vascular resistance in the lower&#xD;
      extremities and an increase in venous capacitance. Hypotension is a distress for both&#xD;
      anesthesiologists and obstetricians as it endangers parturient's hemodynamics and compromises&#xD;
      the uteroplacental blood flow. In clinical practice, there are several ways to treat&#xD;
      hypotension after spinal anesthesia such as preloading with intravenous fluids and&#xD;
      administrating ephedrine. Normotensive maternal blood pressure does neither guarantee the&#xD;
      well-being of the fetus nor ensure the tissue perfusion of the parturient. Based on the&#xD;
      anatomy and physiology basis, we hypothesize that uterine perfusion under spinal anesthesia&#xD;
      would correlate with the perfusion of the lower extremities. To measure the perfusion of the&#xD;
      lower extremities, we use a relative new tool, the non-invasive transcutaneous near infrared&#xD;
      spectroscopy.&#xD;

      This is a prospective observational study. Parturients who are going to receive an elective&#xD;
      cesarean section will be enrolled. Before entering the operating rooms, the parturient&#xD;
      enrolled receives the Doppler studies. The external iliac artery is identified and color&#xD;
      Doppler is activated to locate the uterine artery crossed the external iliac artery. The&#xD;
      probe is stabilized to obtain the maximum flow velocity waveform.The pulsatility index of&#xD;
      these three waveforms is calculated and recorded as the baseline. Three minutes after the&#xD;
      anesthetics are injected, the same procedures of color Doppler are performed again, and the&#xD;
      PI after the spinal anesthesia is recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tissue (cerebral) oximeter (INVOS Cerebral Oximeter Model 5100B; Somanetics, Troy, MI, USA)&#xD;
      is used for the NIRS technique. Two adhesive sensor patches are attached to the parturient.&#xD;
      One sensor patch is applied over the the biceps brachii of the upper limb while the other&#xD;
      adhere to the medial side of the gastrocnemius muscle. After the oximeter shows a stable&#xD;
      reading, the baseline data are recorded. The parturient then receive spinal anesthesia in the&#xD;
      right lateral decubitus position. The intrathecal injection consists of 0.5% hyperbaric&#xD;
      bupivacaine. NIBP is monitored at 2.5 minutes interval for 30 minutes. Tissue oximeter starts&#xD;
      recording every minute right after local anesthetics are injected into the intrathecal space&#xD;
      for a total of fifteen minutes.&#xD;
