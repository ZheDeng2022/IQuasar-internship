  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Ferric pyrophosphate (FePP) is a water-insoluble, food grade iron compound used to fortify&#xD;
      rice, infant cereals and chocolate-drink powders as it causes no organoleptic changes to the&#xD;
      food vehicle. However, it is only of low absorption in man. Therefore, strategies to enhance&#xD;
      the bioavailability of FePP, such as adding citrate or decreasing the particle size of FePP&#xD;
      need to be investigated. The primary objectives of the present study are: 1) to test whether&#xD;
      the presence of citrate in iron fortified rice with FePP results in higher iron&#xD;
      bioavailability, and 2) to test whether the presence of citrate in the rice grain during the&#xD;
      extrusion and cooking process results in higher iron bioavailability compared with&#xD;
      iron-fortified rice where citrate has been added shortly before consumption. As a secondary&#xD;
      objective the investigators will compare the absorption from different FePP combinations with&#xD;
      a reference meal fortified with ferrous sulphate. The investigator hypothesize that the&#xD;
      addition of citrate enhances iron absorption and that the positive effect is greater when the&#xD;
      citrate is added during the extrusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigator will conduct an iron absorption study in 20 women, 18 to 45 years old to&#xD;
      evaluate the iron bioavailability from extruded rice fortified with 1) regular FePP, 2)&#xD;
      regular FePP and citrate (both extruded into the rice kernels), 3) regular FePP and citrate&#xD;
      added at the time of consumption, and 4) from normal rice fortified with ferrous sulphate at&#xD;
      the time of consumption. Iron absorption will be measured as erythrocyte incorporation of&#xD;
      stable iron isotopes at least 14 days after the administration of the isotopically labelled&#xD;
      test meals. The iron absorption from the different meals within the same participant will be&#xD;
      compared by repeated-measures ANOVA followed by a Bonferroni corrected pairwise comparison.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The present study will provide important data where iron bioavailability from rice is&#xD;
      accurately and directly measured using stable isotopic labels as absorption tracers. This&#xD;
      direct data can be used to base decisions on the level of fortification, can potentially&#xD;
      reduce costs and optimize iron delivery to the targeted population in iron fortification&#xD;
      programs.&#xD;
