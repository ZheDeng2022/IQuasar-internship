  <brief_summary>

      The investigators goal is to improve the outcome of patients with acute stroke by inducing&#xD;
      mild cerebral hypothermia through surface cooling at the cervical and shoulder regions using&#xD;
      EMCOOLS Brain.Pads®.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For this project, the investigators can build further on their research group's experience&#xD;
      with hypothermia in animal models and invasive cooling in stroke patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The COOL program will prospectively evaluate safety, feasibility, patient acceptance and&#xD;
      efficacy of mild cerebral hypothermia using EMCOOLS Brain.Pads® in a large cohort of patients&#xD;
      presenting with acute stroke at the Emergency Department of the Universitair Ziekenhuis&#xD;
      Brussel. The application of EMCOOLS Brain.Pads® will be compared to routine clinical practice&#xD;
      in a randomized controlled trial. If proven to be safe, feasible, well-tolerated and&#xD;
      efficacious in the inhospital setting, future use in prehospital acute stroke care will be&#xD;
      incorporated with telemedicine support, as part of the Prehospital Stroke Study at the&#xD;
      Universitair ziekenhuis Brussel (PreSSUB).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Several studies have identified fever as an independent predictor of poor outcome in patients&#xD;
      with acute stroke. Experimental data and clinical studies indicate that therapeutic&#xD;
      hypothermia has neuroprotective effects associated with better clinical outcome, probably&#xD;
      through reduction of infarct volume and cerebral edema in patients with ischemic and&#xD;
      hemorrhagic stroke, respectively. It is to be expected that the beneficiary effects of&#xD;
      hypothermia will be more pronounced if initiated early after stroke onset, which underlines&#xD;
      the rational that this technique ideally should be initiated in the prehospital phase of&#xD;
      acute stroke management.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therapeutic hypothermia can be obtained by external or by endovascular cooling. Most methods&#xD;
      aim to lower the body temperature to &lt;33°C and therefore require patient sedation and&#xD;
      intubation. In contrast to patients with cardiac arrest, sedation and intubation preferably&#xD;
      are avoided and profound cooling of the entire body is not desired nor required in in stroke&#xD;
      patients. EMCOOLS pads® have originally been developed by EMCOOLS Medical Cooling Systems AG&#xD;
      (Austria) for profound external cooling of patients with cardiac arrest. The novel EMCOOLS&#xD;
      Brain.Pad® was redesigned to mildly lower the brain temperature through noninvasive surface&#xD;
      cooling of the cerebropetal arteries at the cervical level. Pilot studies in healthy&#xD;
      volunteers demonstrated that a decrease of 0.5-1°C (tympanic measurement) can be safely&#xD;
      obtained by application of EMCOOLS Brain.Pad® during 60 to 90 minutes. No relevant side&#xD;
      effects were observed in these small studies, but possible effects on cerebrovascular blood&#xD;
      flow were not evaluated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Early application of mild therapeutic hypothermia in acute stroke patients builds further on&#xD;
      their research group's experience with hypothermia in animal models and stroke patients. The&#xD;
      investigators propose a prospective clinical trial comparing current clinical practice with&#xD;
      the induction of mild hypothermia using EMCOOLS Brain.Pads® in patients presenting with acute&#xD;
      stroke. If safety, feasibility, patient acceptance and efficacy are confirmed in the&#xD;
      inhospital setting, the next step will involve evaluation of this approach in prehospital&#xD;
      acute stroke care.&#xD;
