      Our main research question is: Do infants fed with BabyNes Nutrition System grow in agreement&#xD;
      with the WHO reference?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our second question is: Do infants fed with BabyNes Nutrition System have a metabolic profile&#xD;
      closer to breastfed infants?&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to answer both questions an observational trial will be carried out for 12 months in&#xD;
      order to measure weight and to calculate the weight for age z-scores according to the WHO&#xD;
      reference.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A breastfeeding group will be used as reference for the metabolic parameters measured in&#xD;
      blood of infants from Chinese background.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The effect of the Babynes formulas will be compared to the metabolic values obtained from&#xD;
      this breast-feeding reference group.&#xD;

      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      12 months-study, with a breastfeeding group for the comparison of metabolic values obtained&#xD;
      from a Chinese Reference population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Number of subjects:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In total, 120 subjects shall be enrolled. 80 subjects will be assigned in formula fed group&#xD;
      and 40 subjects to breast feeding group. 20% dropouts are already considered for the sample&#xD;
      size of 120.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Product(s) to be tested:&#xD;
&#xD;
      For formula fed group:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  BabyNes 1 months: 0-1 month of age&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  BabyNes 2 months: 1-2 months of age&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  BabyNes 3-6 months: 3-6 months of age&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  BabyNes 7-12 months: 7-12 months of age&#xD;
&#xD;
      For breast feeding group:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Nan HA 1 once the mothers are no more breastfed from 4 months until 6 months old.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Nan HA 2 once the mothers are no more breastfed from 6 months until 1 year old.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Amount, dosage, route of administration, duration of study product:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects are included in the study for duration of upto 1 year old of the infant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For FF group:&#xD;
&#xD;
      From birth to 4 months, they are exclusively fed with the infant formula dispenser (ad&#xD;
      libitum).&#xD;
&#xD;
      From 4 months of age they can start diversification but they maintain the adapted infant&#xD;
      formula to the age until 12 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For BF group:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mothers are encouraged to exclusively breast feed the infant up to 6 months old or at least&#xD;
      until 4 months old. From 4 months of age, or later than 4 months with no more breastfeeding,&#xD;
      they can start Nan HA1 / HA 2 (commercial formula) until the age of 12 months. The amount&#xD;
      should be suitable for the age and appetite of the infants.&#xD;
