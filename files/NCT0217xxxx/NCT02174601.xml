      After written consent for participating in clinical research studies, all clinical studies&#xD;
      conducted to in the one day. The investigators will ask and record about bowel cleansing&#xD;
      state in all patients who performed colonoscopy. There is no additional cost and the expected&#xD;
      complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on answer, the investigators will develop a prediction model for inadequate bowel&#xD;
      preparation and prove validation. This model can take the additional measures to subjects&#xD;
      predicting improper cleansing. It can contribute to improve the accuracy of the test and&#xD;
      reduce the discomfort due to re-performing colonoscopy after re-preparation, as well as cost&#xD;
      savings due to reduced frequency of re-colonoscopy Ultimately, it will be able to bring a&#xD;
      improvement of the quality of management&#xD;
