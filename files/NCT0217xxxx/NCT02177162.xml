  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Physiotherapists' knee OA care is suboptimal. Exercise therapy including a combination of&#xD;
      aerobic, muscle strengthening and functional exercises is not always performed and a lot of&#xD;
      treatments are used for which there is no evidence. By a continuing education session and a&#xD;
      pop-up in the electronic patient file, this study wants to improve knee OA care by focusing&#xD;
      on combined exercise therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be performed in collaboration with Pro-Q-Kine, an independent organization&#xD;
      implementing quality improvement in Belgian physiotherapists' care. Besides Pro-Q-Kine the&#xD;
      study will be performed in collaboration with two or three software producers of&#xD;
      physiotherapists' electronic patient files that reached a national homologation for their&#xD;
      respective software packages and covering a large part of the Flemish physiotherapists.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pro-Q-Kine will organize sessions of continuing education with a focus on optimal knee OA&#xD;
      care. These sessions will be performed in LOK-groups (local peer-groups of physiotherapists&#xD;
      who meet each other for continuing education). At these sessions the physiotherapists will be&#xD;
      asked to take part to the study. A pop-up will be installed in the electronic patient file of&#xD;
      the participating physiotherapists, lightening up when physiotherapists register a patient&#xD;
      with knee OA. The pop-up includes a short message about optimal knee OA care. The&#xD;
      physiotherapists will also receive a script for a query in their electronic patient files in&#xD;
      order to extract those patients that initiated a treatment for knee OA between 1 year and 3&#xD;
      months before the therapists received education. These patients will receive a letter of&#xD;
      their respective physiotherapists in which they are addressed to take part to the study. An&#xD;
      informed consent, patient questionnaire and retour-envelope will be included. There will also&#xD;
      be the opportunity to complete the questionnaire electronically with an electronic informed&#xD;
      consent. The patient questionnaire will include some background details (such as age and&#xD;
      gender) and details about the physiotherapeutic treatments they received for knee OA. The&#xD;
      patient questionnaire will be coded with a number, referring to the physiotherapist and to&#xD;
      the individual patient (the first patient of the first physiotherapist will be coded as 1.01,&#xD;
      the 10th patient of the 14th physiotherapist will be coded as 14.10). Patients' names will&#xD;
      not be revealed to the investigators and physiotherapists will not have any access to the&#xD;
      completed patients' questionnaires. The general practitioners in the environment of the&#xD;
      physiotherapist will (probably) receive a letter from the researchers. This letter will&#xD;
      contain information about the importance of referral to a physiotherapist in knee OA care and&#xD;
      about knee OA care in general. This letter will also refer to the study that is going on in&#xD;
      physiotherapists' care, without details.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Six months after the installation of the pop-up, the physiotherapists will be asked again to&#xD;
      perform the query to extract patients out of the electronic patient file that have been&#xD;
      treated for knee OA and whose treatment sessions had been started in the period of three&#xD;
      months from the installation of the pop-up.&#xD;
