  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This project will test the proximal and distal effects of an integrated dual-generation&#xD;
      intervention approach, Power PATH, in an existing Head Start University Partnership in&#xD;
      Alabama. Dual generation approaches recognize the need to intervene with both parents and&#xD;
      children in Head Start preschools, in order to improve parents' ability to provide safe and&#xD;
      supportive caregiving environments and to prepare children for the transition to elementary&#xD;
      school academically and behaviorally. Parents of Head Start preschoolers often have high&#xD;
      levels of poverty, stress, and mental health needs (Yoshikowa, Aber, &amp; Beardslee, 2012) and&#xD;
      their children are at-risk for academic, behavioral, and social-emotional difficulties (Aber,&#xD;
      Jones, &amp; Cohen, 2000; Costello, Keeler, &amp; Angold, 2001; Morales &amp; Guerra, 2006). Thus, in&#xD;
      this project, two evidence-based and widely-utilized preventive interventions will be adapted&#xD;
      and thoughtfully integrated, in collabo-ration with Head Start personnel, to provide&#xD;
      intensive, high quality services to Head Start parents and children. First, the Power PATH&#xD;
      Parent Intervention program, adapted from Coping Power (Wells, Lochman &amp; Lenhart, 2008) for&#xD;
      this dual-generation approach, will be implemented to address parental mental health needs,&#xD;
      to increase parental employment and financial security, and to improve parents' ability to&#xD;
      model effective social-emotional skills. The parent intervention will help parents create a&#xD;
      positive and predictable home environment, and support their child's academic learning and&#xD;
      emotional and behavioral self-regulation. Second, the Promoting Alterna-tive Thinking&#xD;
      Strategies (PATHS) Preschool Social and Emotional Learning curriculum (Domitrovich et al.,&#xD;
      1999) will be implemented in the preschool classrooms. PATHS is a universal, classroom-based&#xD;
      curriculum that increases children's social-emotional competence and self-regulatory skills,&#xD;
      leading to long-term social, behavioral and academic gains. The Power PATH program will&#xD;
      incorporate both of these parent and child interventions, and will include opportuni-ties for&#xD;
      the children to teach their parents the social and emotional skills they are learning in the&#xD;
      classroom, to promote skill- generalization and transfer to the home environment. This study&#xD;
      will also identify novel intervention mediators and moderators, essential for interrupting&#xD;
      the intergen-erational transmission of chronic social stress, and will identify the best&#xD;
      interventions for families, particularly during preschool when self-regulation skills are&#xD;
      still malleable, and children's primary environments and physiological responses to stress&#xD;
      are likely to moderate intervention effects (Bierman et al., 2008; Boyce &amp; Ellis, 2005;&#xD;
      Porges, 2007). In summary, addressing sources of chronic stress in the parents of Head Start&#xD;
      preschoolers (i.e., employment and financial insecurity, mental health needs, and family&#xD;
      stressors) through the Power PATH dual generation intervention is expected to prepare parents&#xD;
      to better support, shape and model their children's self-regulation skills and to better&#xD;
      foster their children's school readiness, and to improve overall family well-being.&#xD;
