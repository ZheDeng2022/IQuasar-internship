      The purpose of our study is to determine, using a prospective, randomized-controlled trial,&#xD;
      the economic viability and clinical outcomes associated with patient-specific instrumentation&#xD;
      (PSI) for total knee arthroplasty in an obese patient population.&#xD;

      This is a randomized, blinded study. Following REB approval, eligible patients electing to&#xD;
      undergo TKA will be identified by either the PI or co-investigators, and approached in an&#xD;
      orthopaedic outpatient clinic to discuss enrolment into the study. Patients will be enrolled&#xD;
      if they meet the prerequisite inclusion criteria and have signed an informed consent.&#xD;
      Patients will then be randomized to undergo a TKA using PSI, or a conventional TKA. The&#xD;
      randomization sequence will be computer generated using blocks of five. Preoperative&#xD;
      Assessment At baseline, patients will complete a Knee Society Score (KSS), Short-Form 12&#xD;
      (SF-12) Questionnaire, and Western and McMaster University Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC)&#xD;
      questionnaire, and the European Quality of Life Scale Index (EQ-5D). The EQ-5D is a&#xD;
      validated, reliable, and feasible outcome measure that provides a utility index. This utility&#xD;
      index allows quality adjusted life years to be calculated following an intervention. The&#xD;
      questionnaire is a 5-item standardized generic measure of health related quality of life that&#xD;
      includes domains of mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain and discomfort, and anxiety&#xD;
      and depression. Each item is scored using a 3-point response scale and each combination of&#xD;
      response choices describes a health state (resulting in 243 possible health states). Each&#xD;
      health state can then be converted to a utility value ranging from 0 (worst) to 1.0 (best)&#xD;
      using existing preference valuation data[22]. It has been valuated in both Canadian and&#xD;
      American populations for use in assessing health-related quality of life [23, 24]. We will&#xD;
      then calculate each patient's quality-adjusted life year (QALY). QALYs incorporate both&#xD;
      length of life and quality of life into a single measure and are calculated by multiplying&#xD;
      the utility value by the length of time spent in that health state. Additionally, a clinical&#xD;
      assessment will be completed, including knee range of motion, ligamentous assessment, and&#xD;
      evaluating for soft tissue contractures. Finally, patients will have 3-foot coronal and&#xD;
      sagittal standing radiographs of their lower extremities at our institution. The standing&#xD;
      mechanical axis of the involved limb will then be calculated. Skyline views will also be&#xD;
      performed as part of the radiographic analysis. In order for appropriate preoperative&#xD;
      planning, patients randomized to PSI will undergo a computed tomography (CT) scan of the&#xD;
      surgical limb using the TruMatch TM scanning protocol. Following modifications made by the&#xD;
      treating surgeon, the personalized patient instruments will be manufactured in standard&#xD;
      fashion. Intraoperative Assessment On the day of surgery, patients will receive either a&#xD;
      spinal or general anesthetic based on recommendations from an anesthetist, or personal&#xD;
      preference. A non-sterile tourniquet will be applied to the operative limb. A mid-line skin&#xD;
      incision followed by a medial parapatellar arthrotomy will be used for exposure. The femoral&#xD;
      and tibial cuts will be made using conventional instrumentation in the control group, or the&#xD;
      TruMatch TM Personalized Solutions Instruments in the treatment group. Soft tissue balancing,&#xD;
      including releases and removal of osteophytes, will be performed at the discretion of the&#xD;
      surgeon. The Attune TM components will be implanted using cement fixation. At the time of&#xD;
      cementing the implants, patients will receive a parenteral weight-based dose of tranexamic&#xD;
      acid (20 mg /kg), provided that there are no contra-indications. Prior to closure, patients&#xD;
      will receive an intra-articular injection of an anesthetic cocktail. The parapatellar&#xD;
      arthrotomy and subcutaneous tissue and skin will be closed in standard fashion.&#xD;
      Post-operatively, patients will receive deep-vein thrombosis prophylaxis for 14-days&#xD;
      post-operatively. They will also receive 24 hours of post-operative parenteral antibiotics.&#xD;
      They will be assessed by physiotherapy, with weight-bearing and range of motion exercises&#xD;
      beginning on post-operative day 0. Patients will be discharged from hospital once they have&#xD;
      reached appropriate rehabilitative milestones outlined by our institution. Postoperative&#xD;
      Assessment Patients will have routine follow-up with their surgeon at 2-, 6-, and 12-weeks,&#xD;
      followed by 1-year and every other year thereafter. Three-foot coronal and full-length&#xD;
      sagittal standing radiographs, as well as skyline views of the involved knee, will be taken&#xD;
      at the 1-year postoperative visit. We will calculate the mechanical axis of the operative&#xD;
      limb based on this postoperative radiographic assessment. The patients will complete the KSS,&#xD;
      SF-12, WOMAC, and EQ-5D questionnaires at their 6-week, 12-week, and 1-year visits. These&#xD;
      outcome questionnaires will be collected prospectively at 5-years and 10-years&#xD;
      post-operatively through our institution's database. Assessors of both clinical outcomes and&#xD;
      mechanical axis will be blinded to surgical intervention (conventional instrumentation versus&#xD;
      PSI TKA). Patients will also receive a health care resource use diary to complete between&#xD;
      follow-up intervals in order to collect outpatient direct and indirect costs associated with&#xD;
      TKA. Costs Our institution's costs-accounting department will provide information regarding&#xD;
      operating room costs, implant costs, and costs associated with routine care such as nursing,&#xD;
      medications, and investigations. Physician-related costs will be acquired through Ontario&#xD;
      Health Insurance Plan billing protocols. The outpatient cost analysis diary will capture&#xD;
      direct, non-medical costs associated with TKA (see Appendix C). The data will be reported in&#xD;
      Canadian dollars for the fiscal year in which the in-hospital cost data was derived. A sample&#xD;
      database we are currently employing in an unrelated study can be provided if required.&#xD;
      Cost-Utility Analysis Incremental Cost-Utility Ratio (ICUR) The ICUR represents the ratio of&#xD;
      incremental cost to incremental utility. The incremental cost represents the additional cost&#xD;
      of the PSI group compared to the conventional group. The costs will include all direct&#xD;
      (operating room, hospital stay, rehabilitation, medications, investigations) and indirect&#xD;
      costs (informal care, time lost to productivity). Similarly, the incremental utility is the&#xD;
      mean difference in QALY between groups. Net Benefit Regression We will use the net benefit&#xD;
      regression (NBR) framework to estimate the incremental net benefit (INB) of PSI [25]. An&#xD;
      intervention is considered to be cost-effective if the INB is greater than zero. The net&#xD;
      benefit regression method also provides a means to adjust for any potentially confounding&#xD;
      factors and therefore allows greater statistical efficiency and provides a more precise&#xD;
      estimate of the INB. We will include the following covariates in our regression models:&#xD;
      baseline utility score, severity of osteoarthritis, age and number of comorbidities. To&#xD;
      characterize the statistical uncertainty around our estimate of INB we will calculate 95%&#xD;
      confidence intervals, and a cost-effectiveness acceptability curve (CEAC). Modeling To&#xD;
      determine the cost-effectiveness of a new intervention, an economic decision model is&#xD;
      appropriate when there are multiple existing sources of evidence to answer a question (e.g.&#xD;
      randomized trials, cohort studies, registries, etc.) or to forecast the costs and/or outcomes&#xD;
      beyond the follow-up period of the clinical trial. Given that PSI is a relatively new&#xD;
      technology, there is no long-term data available to accurately determine the survival of the&#xD;
      implant or the rate of revision. To accurately answer this question, we will prospectively&#xD;
      follow the cohort long-term to determine survival rates of the implant.&#xD;
