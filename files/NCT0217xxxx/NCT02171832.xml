  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main objective of this study was to investigate the influence of mild and moderate liver&#xD;
      impairment on the pharmacokinetics, safety and selected pharmacodynamic parameters of BI 1744&#xD;
      CL in comparison to a control group with normal hepatic function after single orally inhaled&#xD;
      administration of BI 1744 CL with the Respimat® Inhaler.&#xD;
