    <textblock>
      This prospective protocol will enroll patients with pathologically confirmed solid&#xD;
      malignancies who receive stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) for oligometastases, for&#xD;
      consolidation after systemic therapy, prior to systemic therapy for the purposes of&#xD;
      debulking, or in the re-irradiation setting. Increasing use of SBRT off of clinical trials in&#xD;
      patients with malignancies of all histologies is being utilized in these settings. However,&#xD;
      individualized outcomes and characteristics of treatments are not prospectively followed and&#xD;
      not well documented. By instituting a registry of patients receiving SBRT in these settings&#xD;
      it will be possible to determine trends in patterns of care and outcomes for refinement and&#xD;
      justification of this treatment.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients will be grouped into one of four treatment arms. Treatment intent must be specified&#xD;
      at the time of registration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OLIGOMETASTATIC ARM- The first treatment arm will be for patients with oligometastatic&#xD;
      disease, which will be defined as a treatment with curative intent to less than or equal to&#xD;
      six sites of disease on initial presentation of metastatic disease or within the context of&#xD;
      the initial combined modality treatment regimen (e.g., after a chemotherapy or surgical phase&#xD;
      of therapy). Patients in this treatment arm will receive a definitive, ablative dose of&#xD;
      radiation intended to eradicate all residual gross tumor of &quot;all&quot; sites of disease. A variety&#xD;
      of acceptable ablative fractionation schemes with variable ability to prevent normal tissue&#xD;
      toxicity will be allowed. Further planned systemic therapy or surgery does not eliminate&#xD;
      stratification into this group so long as the overall intent is curative.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CONSOLIDATION ARM- The second treatment arm will be for consolidation following systemic&#xD;
      therapy. This approach is akin to the experience with consolidation with radiation with&#xD;
      conventional radiation after systemic therapy for tumors like bulky lymphomas, etc. In this&#xD;
      context, treatment will be directed towards PET-avid residual disease assuming them to harbor&#xD;
      residual active disease or disease more resistant to systemic therapy. The treatment doses&#xD;
      will be sub-ablative yet will still maintain radiobiologic potency for local control with the&#xD;
      option in the future for further systemic therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      NORTON-SIMON ARM- The third treatment arm will enroll patients prior to receiving systemic&#xD;
      therapy who require initial debulking of gross disease to enhance chemotherapy efficacy per&#xD;
      the Norton-Simon hypothesis. (Patients who initially receive systemic therapy, with gross&#xD;
      residual disease in less than or equal to 6 sites of disease, who then receive SBRT with&#xD;
      planned further systemic therapy (targeted or cytotoxic) immediately following SBRT will be&#xD;
      enrolled onto this arm)&#xD;
&#xD;
      RE-IRRADIATION ARM- The fourth treatment arm will enroll patients if they have had prior&#xD;
      irradiation and suffered disease recurrence or failure within a previously irradiated volume.&#xD;
      Prior irradiation can consist of external beam irradiation- conventional treatment,&#xD;
      hypofractionated treatment, stereotactic radiation, or even brachytherapy&#xD;

             Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while participating in this&#xD;
             study, she should inform her treating physician immediately.&#xD;

             7.1 a female of child-bearing potential is any woman (regardless of sexual&#xD;
             orientation, having undergone a tubal ligation, or remaining celibate by choice) who&#xD;
             meets the following criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Has not undergone a hysterectomy or bilateral oophorectomy; or&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Has not been naturally postmenopausal for at least 12 consecutive months (i.e.,&#xD;

        lymph nodes will not be eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active&#xD;
        infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac&#xD;
        arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study&#xD;
        requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3 Subjects must not be pregnant or nursing due to the potential for congenital&#xD;
        abnormalities and the potential of this regimen to harm nursing infants.&#xD;
