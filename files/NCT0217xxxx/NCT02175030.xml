    <textblock>
      This study is a randomized trial of two IUDs for emergency contraception: the copper IUD, the&#xD;
      most effective method of emergency contraception vs. the levonorgestrel IUD, the most&#xD;
      preferred IUD which has never been tested as an emergency contraceptive. This research has&#xD;
      the potential to increase use of highly effective contraception in a high-risk population and&#xD;
      lower the persistently elevated rate of U.S. unintended pregnancy.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Unintended pregnancy has multiple adverse effects on both maternal and child health. The&#xD;
      United States continues to have one of the highest rates of unintended pregnancy among&#xD;
      developed countries. To combat this problem, we are studying initiation of the highly&#xD;
      effective intrauterine device (IUD) for women presenting for emergency contraception (EC).&#xD;
      This is an ideal population to initiate highly effective reversible contraception (HERC) as&#xD;
      they are at high risk of unintended pregnancy and are acting to reduce that risk. We have&#xD;
      recently demonstrated significantly lower pregnancy rates 12 months after presenting for EC&#xD;
      among women who selected the copper IUD versus those who selected oral Levonorgestrel (LNG).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Not only is the copper IUD the most effective method of EC, it is considered a top tier&#xD;
      anticipatory contraception method and its ability to prevent pregnancy is on par with tubal&#xD;
      sterilization (less than 1% in the first year with lower failure rates in subsequent years).&#xD;
      However, women selecting intrauterine contraception have shown a strong preference for the&#xD;
      LNG IUD. The LNG IUD, is as effective at preventing pregnancy as the Copper IUD, and has some&#xD;
      non-contraceptive effects that many women see as benefits such as the reduction or&#xD;
      elimination of menstrual bleeding and menstrual related discomfort. Of currently available&#xD;
      reversible contraceptives, the LNG IUD has the highest levels of user satisfaction and&#xD;
      continuation. However, its effectiveness as an emergency contraceptive remains unknown. A&#xD;
      randomized control trial is necessary to assess the safety and efficacy of the LNG IUD as EC.&#xD;
      Demonstrating the efficacy, safety, and acceptability of the LNG IUD for EC will improve&#xD;
      options for women seeking EC and who desire a highly effective method of contraception.&#xD;
