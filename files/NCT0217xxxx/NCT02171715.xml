  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the study was to investigate the relative bioavailability and&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics of 20 mg BIBW 2992 administered as film-coated immediate release tablet&#xD;
      (final formulation, i.e. phase III/to-be-marketed formulation) to healthy subjects in&#xD;
      comparison with the drinking solution and in comparison with the trial formulation II tablet,&#xD;
      which was administered in phase II clinical trials and also partly in phase I trials.&#xD;
