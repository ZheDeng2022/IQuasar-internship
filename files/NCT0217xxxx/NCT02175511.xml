    <textblock>
      Importance: Less than fifty percent of patients with hypertensive disease manage to maintain&#xD;
      their blood pressure (BP) within normal levels. Practical (Pragmatic) and sustainable models&#xD;
      are needed in order to improve BP management in patients with hypertension.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: To evaluate whether cloud BP system integrated with computerized physician order&#xD;
      entry (CPOE) is useful for improving BP management as compared with traditional care.&#xD;

      Design, Setting and Patients: A randomized clinical trial study of 382 adults recruited from&#xD;
      786 patients who had been diagnosed with hypertension and receiving treatment for&#xD;
      hypertension in two district hospitals in the north of Taiwan. Physicians had access to&#xD;
      cloud-based BP data from CPOE. Neither participants nor investigators were blinded to group&#xD;
      assignment. The study was conducted for a period of seven months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interventions: Patients from two hospitals were randomized into a control group which&#xD;
      received traditional care (n=212) and an intervention group (n=170) which received a&#xD;
      cloud-based home BP monitoring device. The device measured and transmitted BP data to the&#xD;
      cloud server, which was integrated with the CPOE system in the hospitals. Physicians could&#xD;
      access the BP data during the patient encounter to adjust the antihypertensive therapy&#xD;
      accordingly. Meanwhile, patients could browse their own BP data from their computers, smart&#xD;
      phones, tablets and so on.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Outcome(s) and Measure(s): The primary outcomes were control of systolic BP to less&#xD;
      than 140 mm Hg and diastolic BP to less than 90 mm Hg at two, four and six months. The&#xD;
      secondary outcomes were changes in BP and antihypertensive drug prescription at two, four and&#xD;
      six months.&#xD;
