  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of discontinuation of colchicine&#xD;
      treatment in a specific group of asymptomatic FMF patients with a single mutation in MEFV&#xD;
      gene, both from a clinical and laboratory aspects.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The diagnosis of FMF is mainly clinical and genetic tests are only used to confirm the&#xD;
      diagnosis . Even though the disease is autosomal recessive, not all FMF patients have two&#xD;
      recognizable MEFV mutations. The phenotype of FMF patients varies according to the genotype,&#xD;
      as shown by a number of studies showing that patients with one MEFV mutation have milder&#xD;
      disease or even no symptoms. Some of the previously mentioned studies have shown that ceasing&#xD;
      colchicine prophylaxis in these patients caused no recurrence. So far, no prospective&#xD;
      controlled study has tested the effect of colchicine cessation in this group of FMF patients.&#xD;
      The investigators presume that asymptomatic FMF patients with a single mutation can stop&#xD;
      regular colchicine treatment while remaining under close follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of the work:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To examine the effect of colchicine cessation in a defined group of asymptomatic FMF patients&#xD;
      with a single mutation in MEFV gene.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods and study population:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The work will be a controlled prospective comparative study including FMF patients aged 2-18&#xD;
      years. Patients included will be those who were asymptomatic for six months prior to entering&#xD;
      the study and were regularly treated with colchicine, and with a normal serum level of Serum&#xD;
      Amyloid A (SAA). The study group will include patients with a single MEFV mutation that will&#xD;
      stop colchicine therapy, and the control group will include FMF who will continue regular&#xD;
      colchicine treatment. Follow-up in both groups will include clinical and laboratory (serum&#xD;
      SAA levels) evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study end points and renewal of the colchicine:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Any patient that develops acute symptoms of FMF will be immediately invited to the&#xD;
      rheumatology clinic for medical examination. In addition, patients will be invited to the&#xD;
      clinic after 3 and 6 months from the beginning of the study. At any clinic visit (scheduled&#xD;
      or not) the patients will be assessed clinically and laboratory (serum SAA levels). The study&#xD;
      will be stopped and colchicine will be renewed if at any of the above mentioned clinic visit&#xD;
      the patient will be diagnosed as having a classic FMF attack or the SAA level will be above&#xD;
      10 mg / l.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The importance of the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the investigators conclude that colchicine prophylaxis can be safely discontinued in this&#xD;
      group of FMF patients this will save them a treatment currently defined as a treatment for&#xD;
      life.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients diagnosed with FMF based on clinical criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  FMF patients diagnosed of having at least one common MEFV mutation will be assigned to&#xD;

             study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients were included in the study only if they had normal serum level of SAA (up to&#xD;
