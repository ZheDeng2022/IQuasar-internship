    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the effectiveness of a forced exercise aerobic&#xD;
      exercise program, utilizing a cycling activity, on specific gait parameters and balance in&#xD;
      individuals with Parkinson's Disease (PD). Design: pilot, feasibility, randomized control,&#xD;
      evaluator blinded. Subjects: Twenty four patients with idiopathic PD Hoehn and Yahr (H&amp;Y)&#xD;
      stage II or III. Intervention: Participants randomly assigned to one of two exercise groups,&#xD;
      forced exercise or self selected exercise, on cycling machine three times a week for 8 weeks.&#xD;
      Both groups to exercise at same aerobic intensity level to keep heart rate at 60-80% heart&#xD;
      rate max. Outcomes: Gait parameters of step length, width, and variability as measured by the&#xD;
      GAITRite; 6 Minute Walk Test; mini-BESTest (balance testing); exercise tolerance via Patient&#xD;
      Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) scale.&#xD;
