      Regorafenib is approved in the treatment for metastatic colorectal cancer patients who have&#xD;
      been progressed after standard therapies, however, there has not been a predictive biomarker.&#xD;
      The investigators designed this study to investigate whether [18F]FLT-PET might paly a role&#xD;
      as a predictive imaging biomarker of treatment responses to regorafenib.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Recent advances have been made in the treatments for the patients with metastatic colorectal&#xD;
      cancer (mCRC) owing to the introductions of targeted agents, which included bevacizumab,&#xD;
      cetuximab, panitumumab, and aflibercept. And in addition, regorafenib, a newer tyrosine&#xD;
      kinase inhibitor (TKI), has been approved in the treatment for the mCRC patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Regorafenib (BAY 73-4506) is an orally available multikinase inhibitor with activity against&#xD;
      multiple targets, including tumor angiogenesis (VEGFR-1, -2, -3 and TIE-2), oncogenesis (KIT,&#xD;
      RET, RAF-1, BRAF, and BRAFV600E), and tumor microenvironment (PDGF and FGFR). Regorafenib has&#xD;
      shown antitumor activities in multiple solid tumors, and demonstrated significant efficacy&#xD;
      outcomes in patients with advanced gastrointestinal stromal tumors and colorectal cancers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The CORRECT study, which compared regorafenib vs placebo in mCRC patients who have been&#xD;
      treated with all standard treatment, showed survival improvements with statistical&#xD;
      significances; median OS 6.4 vs 5.0 months, HR 0.77, p=0.0052; median PFS 1.9 vs 1.7 months,&#xD;
      HR 0.49, p&lt;0.000001. Above these results, regorafenib monotherapy has been recently approved&#xD;
      for the treatment of mCRC patients who have been refractory to all of standard therapies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, there are still only a few biomarkers which have been established as predictive of&#xD;
      treatment responses in the fields of treatments for mCRC patients; KRAS or BRAF mutations for&#xD;
      the lack of responses to anti-EGFR agents, cetuximab or panitumumab. There still has not been&#xD;
      any biomarker which would be predictive of treatment responses to bevacizumab, aflibercept or&#xD;
      regorafenib. The difficulties in search for biomarkers for these agents might come from the&#xD;
      facts as following; either bevacizumab or aflibercept does not act directly against tumor&#xD;
      itself and should be combined with cytotoxic agents to show efficacy; regorafenib is a&#xD;
      multikinase inhibitor which has too many potential targets.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Above these reasons, imaging modalities can be fascinating and alternative candidates for&#xD;
      predictive biomarkers of treatment responses. Conventional anatomic imaging studies such as&#xD;
      computed tomography (CT) scans can hardly predict the treatment responses earlier, and the&#xD;
      RECIST using CT scans, which is widely used for measurement of treatment responses, might&#xD;
      have several limitations for measurement of efficacy from targeted agents such as cystic&#xD;
      necrosis without tumor shrinkage. In the CORRECT study, overall response rate by RECIST was&#xD;
      only 1%, although the rates for disease stabilization was up to 40%, which might be a good&#xD;
      example for the limitations of the RECIST using conventional anatomical imaging studies for&#xD;
      the response evaluation of regorafenib.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Among imaging studies, PET scans are useful tools for the noninvasive measurement of&#xD;
      functional changes after treatment with targeted agents, and [18F]FLT-PET is potentially&#xD;
      useful tool for earlier prediction of treatment responses because it can detect earlier&#xD;
      changes of cellular proliferation using [18F]FLT (fluorothymidine), a radiotraceable&#xD;
      substitute for thymidine which is essential for DNA synthesis. Several studies have been&#xD;
      reported that [18F]FLT-PET may allow an early assessment of the response to chemotherapy&#xD;
      including targeted agents. There also has been a report that [18F]FLT-PET could predict&#xD;
      treatment responses of BRAF inhibitors in the colorectal cancer xenograft model; regorafenib&#xD;
      also has an inhibitory effect on BRAF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, the investigators have planned this study with hypothesis that [18F]FLT-PET could&#xD;
      be useful for identifying a subgroup of mCRC patients with clinical responsiveness to&#xD;
      regorafenib.&#xD;

Regorafenib will be administered 160 mg/day given orally on day 1 to days 21 following 7 days break, which consists of 4 weeks as 1 cycle. Treatment will be repeated every 4 weeks and continued until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity or the patient's refusal. Standard anatomical response evaluation will be performed every 8 weeks (without regard to the cycles or schedules of chemotherapy). Additional [18F]FDG-PET will be performed before treatment and at 8 weeks (just once at the point of first response evaluation).</description>
