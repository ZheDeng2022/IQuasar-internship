  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective was the assessment of safety of BIBW 2992 as assessed by the maximum&#xD;
      tolerated dose (MTD). Secondary objectives were collection of overall safety data, antitumor&#xD;
      efficacy data, as well as the determination of pharmacokinetics and the pharmacodynamic&#xD;
      modulation of biomarkers by BIBW 2992.&#xD;
