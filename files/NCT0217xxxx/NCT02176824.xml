      Chronotherapy is a term that describes therapeutic alterations of sleep wake cycles.&#xD;
      Different variations of sleep deprivation, set sleep wake schedules, and types of light&#xD;
      therapy have demonstrated efficacy in rapidly treating depression, and suicidal thinking.&#xD;
      This study seeks to explore the effect of two different chronotherapuetic protocols on&#xD;
      acutely depressed and suicidal inpatients admitted to the Medical University of South&#xD;
      Carolina&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There is a consistently reported, rapid antidepressant response to a single night of total&#xD;
      sleep deprivation in both unipolar, and bipolar depression. The clinical utility of this&#xD;
      technique has been limited however, because responders have typically relapsed rapidly&#xD;
      following recovery sleep. The addition of pharmacotherapy, sleep phase advance (a shift to an&#xD;
      earlier sleep schedule with normalization over three days), and bright light therapy to sleep&#xD;
      deprivation have each demonstrated efficacy in preventing relapse into depression. Combined&#xD;
      total sleep deprivation, sleep phase advance, and bright light therapy, dubbed Triple&#xD;
      Chronotherapy along with concomitant pharmacotherapy has demonstrated a rapid improvement in&#xD;
      depressive symptoms that has remained durable for as long as 9 weeks post intervention. If&#xD;
      the early, encouraging results of Triple Chronotherapy hold up to further study, the&#xD;
      technique represents a near ideal inpatient treatment, as it is inexpensive, relatively easy&#xD;
      to carry out, and has minimal side effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite encouraging early results, only one published report has attempted to use triple&#xD;
      chronotherapy in suicidal patients, and in that trial only bipolar depressed patients were&#xD;
      included, and one single variation of chronotherapy was tested (Three nights of sleep&#xD;
      deprivation every other night with three light therapy sessions, combined with lithium). The&#xD;
      lack of data in acutely suicidal patients significantly limits the utility of this&#xD;
      intervention in the United States, where few non-suicidal patients are admitted. Published&#xD;
      trials to this point have also excluded those with comorbid illness, which also limits the&#xD;
      clinical usefulness of this intervention to a minority of patients. Furthermore there are&#xD;
      sparse randomized adequately controlled trials, and still limited durability data on the&#xD;
      technique.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We recently explored the tolerability and feasibility of the technique on acutely depressed&#xD;
      and suicidal inpatients admitted to our inpatient unit with encouraging results. We&#xD;
      subsequently propose to further explore the utility of this technique by piloting its effect&#xD;
      compared to an active sham condition to determine if further study is indicated. Should&#xD;
      further study be warranted, we hope to use the collected pilot data to determine the&#xD;
      necessary number of participants to detect an effect.&#xD;
