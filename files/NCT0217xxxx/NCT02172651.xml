  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study seeks to learn more about the vitamin D receptor and its relationship to colon&#xD;
      cancer. The Vitamin D receptor is found in colon cancer cells. When Vitamin D binds to the&#xD;
      receptor in the cancer cells, it may stop cancer cells from growing abnormally and may cause&#xD;
      cancer cell death. Vitamin D has been used in other research studies and information from&#xD;
      those other research studies suggests that Vitamin D may help in the treatment of colon&#xD;
      cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will receive either high-dose vitamin D or standard-dose vitamin D. The study&#xD;
      drug will be given 14-28 days prior to your surgery. The number of days will depend on when&#xD;
      the surgery is scheduled.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The participant will be given a study drug-dosing diary to keep track of when they take the&#xD;
      study drug. The participant will be taking the study drug once every day, for 14 - 28 days,&#xD;
      prior to their surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Run-In Phase: The first 6-12 participants will receive high-dose vitamin D prior to&#xD;
           surgery. The number of participants in this phase will be based on the results of the&#xD;
           analyzed research samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Randomized Phase: Because no one knows which of the study options is best, the&#xD;
           participant will be &quot;randomized&quot; into one of the study groups: high dose vitamin D or&#xD;
           standard dose vitamin D.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  48 Participants will be randomized to receive high-dose vitamin D or standard-dose&#xD;
                vitamin D. Randomization means that the participants are put into a group by&#xD;
                chance. Neither the participant nor the research doctor will choose what group the&#xD;
                participant will be in. The participant will have an equal chance of getting&#xD;
                assigned to each arm (like flipping a coin). The randomized phase will enroll to&#xD;
                two groups at the same time:&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  Group A: 24 participants with a recent diagnosis of stage I, II or III colon&#xD;
                     cancer will be randomized to receive high-dose vitamin D or standard-dose&#xD;
                     vitamin D.&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  Group B: 24 participants with resectable liver metastases from colon cancer&#xD;
                     will be randomized to receive high-dose vitamin D or standard-dose vitamin D.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additional research procedures to be performed on study:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood samples will be collected for research purposes (a little more than 2 teaspoons of&#xD;
           blood). The samples will be collected immediately prior to the participant's surgery and&#xD;
           used to study the vitamin D receptor and pathway, as well as its relationship to colon&#xD;
           cancer. Some of this blood will be stored to be used for future cancer research.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Tumor tissue will be collected for research purposes at the time of the participant&#xD;
           surgery. This tissue will also be used to study the vitamin D receptor and pathway, as&#xD;
           well as its relationship to colon cancer. Some of the tumor tissue collected will be&#xD;
           sent for use in a separate, but related study. In this study, the participant's tumor&#xD;
           will be used to grow cell lines. This means the participant's tumor cells will be&#xD;
           multiplied in the lab. These cell lines will be used to study the binding sites in the&#xD;
           genes of participants and learn more about vitamin D's role in preventing colon cancer.&#xD;

    <time_frame>14 to 28 days</time_frame>
    <description>Compare VDR binding sites between supplementation arms (high-dose versus standard-dose), between malignant versus adjacent benign colon or liver tissue in those receiving high-dose vitamin D, and between primary colon tumors versus liver metastases in patients exposed to high-dose vitamin D. Laboratory procedures for enriching epithelial cells from the surgical specimen, sonicating cross-linked chromatin, immunoprecipitating VDR-chromatin complexes, and preparing DNA libraries for massively parallel sequencing will be refined.</description>

    <measure>RNA transcriptome</measure>
    <time_frame>28 days</time_frame>
    <description>The goal is to infer direct transcriptional targets of VDR by determining which loci bind VDR and also alter gene expression in response to high-dose vitamin D supplementation. RNA-Seq libraries, prepared from poly(A)+ mRNA and sequenced by Illumina Hi-seq, will be analyzed using Tophat, Cufflinks60 and other new statistical packages to identify consistent differences in transcript levels between tissues exposed to high-dose versus standard-dose vitamin D3 at pre-determined FDRs on the order of 0.01. Stringent tests for statistically significant differences in RNA levels between samples are built into the algorithms for RNA-seq analysis.</description>

                  prior to study entry. Women of child-bearing potential include any female who has&#xD;
                  experienced menarche and who has not undergone surgical sterilization&#xD;
                  (hysterectomy, bilateral tubal ligation, or bilateral oophorectomy) or is not&#xD;
                  postmenopausal (defined as amenorrhea ≥12 consecutive months; or women on hormone&#xD;
                  replacement therapy with documented serum follicle stimulating hormone level &gt;35&#xD;
                  mIU/mL). Women who are using oral, implanted, or injectable contraceptive&#xD;

                  abstinence or where partner is sterile (e.g., vasectomy), should be considered to&#xD;
                  be of child-bearing potential.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  The effects of higher-dose vitamin D3 and colon or liver surgery (and associated&#xD;
                  perioperative medications and anesthesia) on the developing human fetus are&#xD;
                  unknown and may pose unacceptable risk. For this reason, women of child-bearing&#xD;
                  potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier&#xD;
                  method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry and for the duration of&#xD;
                  study participation. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant&#xD;
                  while participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician&#xD;
                  immediately.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;

        for admission into the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prior systemic therapy, radiotherapy, or investigational agent in participants&#xD;
             undergoing surgery for stage I, II, or III colon cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants who have had chemotherapy or radiotherapy within 4 weeks (6 weeks for&#xD;
             bevacizumab) of liver resection.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Concurrent use of other anti-cancer therapy, including chemotherapy agents, targeted&#xD;
             agents, biological agents, immunotherapy, or investigational agents not otherwise&#xD;
             specified in this protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Inability to swallow pills.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of malabsorption or uncontrolled vomiting or diarrhea, or any other disease&#xD;
             significantly affecting gastrointestinal function that could interfere with absorption&#xD;
             of oral medications.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic&#xD;
             composition to vitamin D.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Regular use of supplemental vitamin D totaling ≥ 2,000 IU/day in the past year.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Use of supplemental vitamin D or supplements containing vitamin D beyond the&#xD;
                  protocol-prescribed study treatment is not allowed during the treatment period of&#xD;
                  this clinical trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  In order to maintain blinding, vitamin D levels should not be routinely checked&#xD;
                  at screening or during the study by the treating investigator. Vitamin D levels&#xD;
                  will be assayed only as part of the research blood samples collected during the&#xD;
                  study. If there are concerns related to a participant's vitamin D status, the&#xD;
                  lead Principal Investigator should be contacted for further discussion.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Use of chronic oral corticosteroid therapy, lithium, phenytoin, quinidine, isoniazid,&#xD;
             and/or rifampin (all of which can cause vitamin D depletion). Short-term use of&#xD;
             corticosteroids as anti-emetic therapy for chemotherapy is permitted.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Regular use of thiazide diuretics (i.e., hydrochlorothiazide), which can lead to&#xD;
             hypercalcemia, and unwillingness or inability to discontinue or switch to an&#xD;
             alternative anti-hypertensive agent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pre-existing hypercalcemia (defined as baseline serum calcium above the institutional&#xD;
             ULN, corrected for albumin level if albumin is not within institutional limits of&#xD;
             normal).&#xD;
&#xD;
             -- The use of supplemental calcium or supplements containing calcium is prohibited&#xD;
             during the treatment period of this clinical trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Known active hyperparathyroid disease or other serious disturbance of calcium&#xD;
             metabolism in the past 5 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of symptomatic genitourinary stones within the past year.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active&#xD;
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac&#xD;
             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that, in the opinion of the&#xD;
             investigator, may increase the risks associated with study participation or study&#xD;
             treatment, limit compliance with study requirements, or interfere with the&#xD;
             interpretation of study results.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant or nursing women or men/women of child-bearing potential who are unwilling to&#xD;
             employ adequate contraception.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -- Pregnant and nursing women are excluded from this study because there is an unknown&#xD;
             but potential risk of adverse events related to higher-dose vitamin D3 and colon or&#xD;
             liver surgery (and associated perioperative medications and anesthesia) on the human&#xD;
             fetus. Consequently, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is enrolled on&#xD;
             the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of prior or synchronous malignancy except:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  A malignancy that was treated with curative intent, for which there has been no&#xD;
                  known active disease for &gt;3 years prior to randomization, and for which the risk&#xD;
                  of recurrence is low as determined by the investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Curatively treated non-melanoma skin malignancy, cervical cancer in situ, or&#xD;
                  prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia without evidence of prostate cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Known positive test for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis C virus, or&#xD;
             acute or chronic hepatitis B infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Participants with these infections are ineligible because they are at increased&#xD;
                  risk of significant complications in the perioperative period, particularly for&#xD;
                  active hepatitis B or C patients undergoing liver resection. Appropriate studies&#xD;
                  will be undertaken in participants receiving combination antiretroviral therapy&#xD;
                  when indicated.&#xD;
