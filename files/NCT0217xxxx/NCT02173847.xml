  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Laser- assisted procedures in penetrating keratoplasty (PK) are proposed to improve the&#xD;
      surgical outcomes: minimally invasive procedures, improved biomechanical stability of the&#xD;
      transplanted flap, reduction of rejection risks, reduction of inflammation, reduction of&#xD;
      infections risk, faster healing process.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to achieve these goals, two different lasers were used during PK surgery:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  a femtosecond laser to cut an anvil shaped profile&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  a diode laser to weld the surgical wound&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The femtosecond laser is used to cut an anvil-shaped laser incision used in PK. This design&#xD;
      has the purpose to create a more structurally stable and predictable wound configuration with&#xD;
      the aim of a faster recovery of vision and higher optical quality, compared with the&#xD;
      conventional blade trephination and the most common laser-cut patterns. The &quot;anvil&quot; profile&#xD;
      is designed as described in the followings. Donor and recipient corneal trephination are&#xD;
      performed using a 150 kHz FS laser (iFS150TM, IntralaseTM FS Laser, Abbott Medical Optics&#xD;
      -AMO, Santa Ana, CA, USA). As concerned iFS150 settings, we refer to the following technical&#xD;
      parameters: in the donor graft, the outer and inner diameters of the ring lamellar cut at 350&#xD;
      µm in depth were set at 8.5 mm and 6.6 mm, respectively; the anterior-side cut started with&#xD;
      an angle of 135° at a diameter of 7.7 mm, while the straight posterior side cut diameter was&#xD;
      6.7 mm. In the recipient eye, the diameters were designed to be 0.2 mm shorter (8.3 mm outer&#xD;
      diameter, 6.4 mm inner diameter, 7.5 mm anterior side cut and 6.5 mm posterior side cut).&#xD;
      After completion of the trephination, the corneal button was gently lifted from the host and&#xD;
      the donor graft was secured in place on the recipient bed by means of 10-0 nylon cardinal&#xD;
      sutures, which were removed after the final 16-running 10-0 nylon suture was completed. A&#xD;
      similar FS-laser cut procedure producing a 0.2 mm-narrower corneal bed -diameter is performed&#xD;
      on the patient's recipient eye. After completion of the trephination, the corneal button is&#xD;
      lifted gently from the host and the donor graft is secured into place with 10-0 nylon&#xD;
      cardinal sutures, that are removed as a running 10-0 nylon suture is placed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The particular &quot;anvil&quot; shape of the graft provides a larger contact surface in between donor&#xD;
      and recipient cornea, which enables an effective application of the diode laser welding&#xD;
      technique of corneal wounds we have previously set up in cataract and PK applications&#xD;
      (Menabuoni et al. 2007, Rossi et al. 2008). This laser-assisted suturing technique is based&#xD;
      on the photothermal activation of the stromal collagen, providing an immediate sealing of the&#xD;
      surgical wound and a good stabilization of the graft. Once the donor graft was sutured in its&#xD;
      final position, diode laser welding was performed. A sterile saturated water solution of 10%&#xD;
      w/v Indocyanine Green (ICG) (Pulsion Medical System AG, Munich, Germany) was prepared and&#xD;
      applied to the walls of the surgical wound at the donor-recipient interface. A mild&#xD;
      photothermal effect was induced by means of a near infrared diode laser (Mod. WELD 800,&#xD;
      El.En., Calenzano, FI, Italy) that emitted at 810 nm. The laser light was delivered through a&#xD;
      300-micron core diameter optical fiber that was mounted on a handpiece and used &quot;as a pencil&quot;&#xD;
      by the surgeon under a surgical microscope. In a slow, continuous/fluid motion, the surgeon&#xD;
      moved the fiber tip along the wound edge at a distance of 1.5 mm from the external surface of&#xD;
      the cornea. The power radiation emitted was a 60 mW continuous wave, which resulted in an 8&#xD;
      W/cm2 power density on the tissue surface. The laser welding treatment time was set at 130s.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thanks two the combine laser assisted procedures, the possible reduction of suture materials&#xD;
      allows a faster and improved the healing process, with minimal inflammation and reaction.&#xD;
      Thus the combination of FS laser trephination with the diode laser welding technique may&#xD;
      provide extremely precise, and minimally invasive surgical procedures in PK.&#xD;
