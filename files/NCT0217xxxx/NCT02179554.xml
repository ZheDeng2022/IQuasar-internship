  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The loss of the sense of smell, anosmia, can have profound effects on the lives of those who&#xD;
      suffer from it. In our clinical practice, we have encountered several patients complaining of&#xD;
      anosmia after recently undergoing surgery requiring cardiopulmonary bypass. We want to&#xD;
      investigate this peculiar observation and determine if such a link exists. Thus far, there&#xD;
      have been no similar studies published, and as such, no previous evidence on this matter.&#xD;
      This study will help formalise and clarify these observations, empowering clinicians to&#xD;
      better inform patients in the future; if cardiopulmonary bypass procedures do carry a risk of&#xD;
      anosmia. This study may also give rise to further research into the matter.&#xD;

      Objectives: To investigate the incidence of anosmia arising in patients after undergoing&#xD;
      cardiopulmonary bypass, and compare it to a control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: Patients undergoing cardiopulmonary bypass may suffer from anosmia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology: Potential participants will be identified via scheduled operating lists at&#xD;
      Manchester Royal Infirmary. Suitable patients will be informed, including informational&#xD;
      leaflets about the study, and permissions sought with an informed consent form. Once&#xD;
      recruited, when the patients come for their pre-operative assessment, olfactory assessment&#xD;
      will be carried out using the Sniffing Sticks smell kit and a validated questionnaire&#xD;
      (Dresden Questionnaire of Olfactory Disorders). The Sniffing Sticks smell kit composes of 12&#xD;
      different pen-like odour dispensers. Each stick is presented to the patient who then chooses&#xD;
      from four different answers, the one that best represents the odour. The patient then&#xD;
      receives a score of 0 to 12. A reassessment via the same questionnaire and smell kit is&#xD;
      repeated after 1 week or just before discharge (whichever is earlier) after the patient's&#xD;
      surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Management and Statistical Analyses: All participant information will be stored&#xD;
      electronically in a password protected trust computer. Participant identifiers will also be&#xD;
      kept in a separate password protected folder from the main database of individual participant&#xD;
      information. We will use MS Excel for compiling the data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Type: Prospective, single-centre, observational study&#xD;
&#xD;
      Target Sample size: 50 patients undergoing elective surgery requiring cardiopulmonary bypass&#xD;
      (study group) 50 patients total&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedures for Obtaining and Documenting Consent: All patients undergoing major surgery will&#xD;
      require to attend a preoperative planning clinic. Information leaflets will be disseminated&#xD;
      at this time, which includes contact details of involved researchers. Depending on&#xD;
      availability, the principal researcher would be present during the preoperative clinics to&#xD;
      answer any questions. Contact details will be taken for any patient considering to&#xD;
      participate at this point whilst any patient who initially refuse and choose to participate&#xD;
      later will require to contact the researchers to opt back in. Potential participants will&#xD;
      then be contacted via their mode of choice (email/telephone) to assess if they want to&#xD;
      participate. On the day of planned admission into hospital for elective surgery, or at&#xD;
      another agreed upon time, a written consent will be obtained and all questions addressed&#xD;
      immediately before the study is conducted. Patients undergoing major surgery are normally&#xD;
      admitted into hospital the day before surgery. This time period is opportunistic as from&#xD;
      experience, most patients will have ample free time from then till the day of surgery and a&#xD;
      distraction would most probably be welcome. However, if no such opportunity is foreseen, a&#xD;
      separate appointment in hospital grounds can be made at a suitable time. After the operation,&#xD;
      a repeat study will be done, ideally in conjunction with any one of their follow up visits to&#xD;
      the hospital, which normally involves a waiting time. Otherwise, an alternate suitable&#xD;
      appointment can be arranged. Any arranged appointments will restricted to working hours&#xD;
      (Mon-Fri 8am-5pm) in the ENT outpatients department at Manchester Royal Infirmary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Risks and benefits: There are no risks to patients who participate in this study. There are&#xD;
      also no direct benefits to the participant other than having a free objective measurement of&#xD;
      their sense of smell and learning about the nature of the study. Patient participation is&#xD;
      purely voluntary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Confidentiality: Each participant will be identified by an assigned code number. This will be&#xD;
      stored in a separate file from the main database, only accessible on a password protected&#xD;
      server. Thus, each participant's data is kept anonymous. Informed consent forms will be&#xD;
      locked a separate file cabinet.&#xD;
