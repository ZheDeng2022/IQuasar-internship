      Rationale:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The introduction of drug-eluting stents (DES) in the treatment of coronary artery disease has&#xD;
      led to a significant reduction in morbidity but there are further demands on DES performance.&#xD;
      Such demands are an optimized performance in very challenging coronary lesions; third&#xD;
      generation DES were developed in an effort to further improve DES performance in such&#xD;
      challenging lesions. Two CE-certified third generation DES (Resolute Integrity and Promus&#xD;
      Element stents) are currently available; there are no data that indicate an advantage of one&#xD;
      of these DES over the other.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To investigate whether the clinical outcome is similar after implantation of the Promus&#xD;
      Element versus the Resolute Integrity stent (non-inferiority hypothesis).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Multicenter, prospective, randomized single-blinded study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who require percutaneous coronary interventions (PCI) for the treatment of coronary&#xD;
      stenoses with an indication for DES use, according to current guidelines and/or the operators&#xD;
      clinical judgement. All clinical syndromes will be included.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In patients who are eligible for DES implantation, the type of DES implanted will be&#xD;
      randomized (Resolute Integrity stent versus Promus Element stent). At the start of the study,&#xD;
      both DES will also be used in routine clinical practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main study endpoints:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary endpoint is the incidence of target vessel failure at one year follow-up. Target&#xD;
      vessel failure (TVF) is a composite endpoint consisting of cardiac death, target vessel MI,&#xD;
      or clinically driven target vessel revascularization. Further secondary clinical and&#xD;
      angiographic endpoints will be investigated, defined in accordance with suggestions of the&#xD;
      Academic Research Consortium (ARC). Of note, the angiographic assessment is based on&#xD;
      clinically indicated projections only and results in no additional x-ray exposure. There is&#xD;
      no routine angiographic follow-up. If angiographic data are available in patients who undergo&#xD;
      symptom-driven re-catheterization, we will analyze these data to get insight into the&#xD;
      mechanisms of potential DES restenosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nature and extent of the burden and risks associated with participation, benefit and group&#xD;
      relatedness: Patients will receive the routine clinical treatment. As a consequence, the&#xD;
      risks of this trial do not exceed the risks of any routine PCI procedure.&#xD;

      1. OBJECTIVES&#xD;
&#xD;
           Primary research questions To investigate whether the outcome after the randomized&#xD;
           implantation of the Resolute Integrity versus Promus Element drug-eluting stent are&#xD;
           similar, as assessed in a non-inferiority setting by comparing target-vessel failure&#xD;
           (TVF) of both stents at one year follow-up post stent implantation. In brief, we want to&#xD;
           compare for both drug-eluting stents the combined endpoint of (1) cardiac death, (2)&#xD;
           myocardial infarction that can be related to the target vessel or cannot be related to&#xD;
           another vessel, and (3) clinically indicated revascularization related to the&#xD;
           target-vessel. Based on the results of the RESOLUTE all-comers trial (the study stents&#xD;
           in the RESOLUTE all comers trial used the same coatings and drugs used in the current&#xD;
           trial but on different bare metal stent platforms), non-inferiority of Resolute&#xD;
           Integrity and Promus Element is expected. This is not tested in a controlled randomized&#xD;
           trial yet.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Secondary research questions Effectivity, safety, clinical short- and long-term outcome,&#xD;
           and the acute angiographic results of the implantation of two third-generation&#xD;
           drug-eluting stents will be compared in a &quot;real world&quot;, all-comers scenario.&#xD;
           Angiographic comparison will be based on the routine coronary angiography runs recorded&#xD;
           during diagnostic coronary angiography and PCI procedures. No additional mandatory&#xD;
           angiographic studies after the index PCI are required.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. STUDY DESIGN&#xD;
&#xD;
           The DUTCH PEERS Study is a multi-center prospective single-blinded randomized study.&#xD;
           Randomization will involve the type of DES used in study population. Patients will be&#xD;
           blinded to the type DES they will receive. The general practitioner of the patient will&#xD;
           be requested not to disclose this information to the patient. Analysts who perform the&#xD;
           data analyses will be blinded to the type DES used as well.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. STUDY POPULATION 3.1 Population (base) All patients who fulfil the inclusion criteria&#xD;
           and undergo PCI with potential DES implantation will be asked to participate in the&#xD;
           DUTCH PEERS, unless they meet one or more of the exclusion criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will receive a drug-eluting stent according to the guidelines (Guidelines NVVC/ESC)&#xD;
      and/or the clinical decision of the interventional cardiologist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.2 Inclusion criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Minimum age of 18 years&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Coronary artery disease and lesion(s) eligable for treatment with drug eluting stents&#xD;
           according to clinical guidelines and/or the operators' judgement&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patient is willing and able to cooperate with study procedures and required follow-up&#xD;
           visits; and patient has been informed and agrees on the participation by signing an EC&#xD;
           approved written informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.3 Exclusion criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participation in another randomized drug or device study before reaching primary&#xD;
           endpoint&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Planned surgery within 6 months of PCI unless dual antiplatelet therapy is maintained&#xD;
           throughout the peri-surgical period&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  intolerance to a P2Y12 receptor antagonist that results in the patient's inability to&#xD;
           adhere to dual-antiplatelet therapy, or intolerance to aspirin, heparin, or components&#xD;
           of the two DES examined.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Known pregnancy&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Life expectancy of less than 1 year&#xD;
&#xD;
      4.1 Randomisation, blinding and treatment allocation Patients will be randomised by a&#xD;
      computer program (block stratified randomization V5.0 by S. Piantadosi). The randomisation&#xD;
      will be done in blocks of 8 and 4 in random order. No stratification will be employed. The&#xD;
      study will be single blinded because the physician will know which stent is implanted. The&#xD;
      patient will not know. Every attempt will be made to do all outcome assessments blinded. The&#xD;
      analyst performing QCA and IVUS analysis will be blinded to the type of DES used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Demographics and Medical Data&#xD;
&#xD;
      At baseline the data are collected by the researchers, research nurses, and/or nurse&#xD;
      practitioners. Demographic and medical data are also collected by reviewing the patient's&#xD;
      medical chart:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  demographics including: date of birth, gender, family history of cardiovascular disease,&#xD;
           smoking habits;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  medical history including: arterial hypertension, diabetes mellitus,&#xD;
           hypercholesterolemia, previous myocardial infarction, previous revascularization by&#xD;
           means of CABG / PCI, previous cerebrovascular accident (CVA) or transient ischemic&#xD;
           attack (TIA), renal failure requiring haemodialysis;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  current medication;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  body-mass index, arterial blood pressure, heart frequency;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  indication for PCI;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  symptoms prior to PCI: angina pectoris (CCS class), dyspnea (NYHA class).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood samples Laboratory tests will be performed in the local laboratories of the&#xD;
      participating centres as part of their clinical routine practice. In elective and primary PCI&#xD;
      before and the day after the PCI procedure, blood tests will be performed (assessment of Hb,&#xD;
      Kreatinine, CK, CK-MB, and Troponines). If patients suffer from persistent chest pain after&#xD;
      PCI, additional controls of the cardiac markers will be performed on the day of PCI as part&#xD;
      of the clinical routine. In case of symptoms suspicious of an acute coronary event in&#xD;
      patients scheduled for elective PCI, the assessment of cardiac markers prior to PCI is&#xD;
      considered as good clinical practice and should be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PCI procedure Routine PCI will be performed according to routine medical practice in&#xD;
      including centres with no deviation from routine protocols. No additional angiographic views&#xD;
      will be required. Patients will receive one or more DES during PCI. The type of DES used&#xD;
      during PCI will be randomized. Detailed technical information on PCI procedures are provided&#xD;
      in the current European society of cardiology guidelines of PCI. [27] If clinically&#xD;
      indicated, IVUS-guidance will be used during PCI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mixture of stents should be avoided and is only permitted if the operator is unable to insert&#xD;
      the study stent, in which case crossover to another non-study stent is possible. Treatment of&#xD;
      all coronary lesions should be aimed in one session, however staged procedures (defined as&#xD;
      procedures planned at the time of the index procedure and performed within 6 weeks with the&#xD;
      same type of study stent) will be permitted. In case of unplanned revascularization&#xD;
      procedures requiring stent implantation, it is recommended that physicians use the same study&#xD;
      stent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Medical therapy Medical therapy does not differ from current routine medical treatment. In&#xD;
      brief, patients who are not on oral aspirin therapy receive a loading dose of at least 300 mg&#xD;
      prior to PCI. In elective PCI patients, clopidogrel therapy of 75 mg daily is started one&#xD;
      week before the PCI. In urgent PCI, a loading dose of 600 mg clopidogrel is given as soon as&#xD;
      possible, either before PCI or (at least) directly after the PCI is performed. In case&#xD;
      prasugrel is used, patients will receive a loading dose of 60 mg of prasugrel followed by a&#xD;
      daily dose of 10 mg for at least 12 months. Directly prior to PCI, an adequate dose of&#xD;
      unfractionated heparin is administered i.v. or i.a. In general, an intracoronary bolus of&#xD;
      nitrates will be administered prior to PCI. The use of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors is&#xD;
      left at the operators' discretion. Following the index PCI procedure, patients are generally&#xD;
      maintained on aspirin &gt;=80 mg daily during the entire trial (and preferably lifelong). In&#xD;
      general, clopidogrel 75 mg daily is recommended and prescribed for a period of 12 months in&#xD;
      addition to aspirin. If patients require oral anticoagulation therapy (e.g. for atrial&#xD;
      fibrillation), aspirin &gt;=80 mg daily is prescribed for one month after PCI and clopidogrel&#xD;
      for 12 months. Further medical treatment is performed according to current medical&#xD;
      guidelines, clinical standards, and the judgment of the referring physicians.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up data collection Follow-up data will be collected during routine visits to&#xD;
      outpatient clinic and/or phone calls. If no data are available from outpatient clinic visits,&#xD;
      the required data will be collected through a phone call. The phone call follow-up will be&#xD;
      conducted through blinded members of the research team (nurse practicioners, cardioresearch&#xD;
      personnel or research fellows). Through an outpatient clinic visit or a telephone call&#xD;
      patients will be asked about recurrence of symptoms or new symptoms which can indicate the&#xD;
      presence of restenosis. Patients will be also asked about possible revascularization or&#xD;
      myocardial infarction during the follow-up period. In case of death, information will be&#xD;
      obtained from the patient's medical chart, GP or cardiologist. Patients will be called after&#xD;
      1 month, 12 months and 24 months. The mode of data acquisition of the follow up (telephone or&#xD;
      outpatient visit) will be registered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to determine whether a myocardial infarction is related or unrelated to the target&#xD;
      vessel, a Critical Events Committee consisting of two independent cardiologists will be asked&#xD;
      to provide an independent conclusion about the location of an infarction on the&#xD;
      electrocardiogram.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adverse events, comprised by the primary endpoint, will be monitored by an independent&#xD;
      external contract research organisation. In addition, we intend that secondary clinical&#xD;
      endpoints of at least 10% of patients will be monitored, too.&#xD;
