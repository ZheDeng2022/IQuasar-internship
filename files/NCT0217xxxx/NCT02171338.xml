  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate weather or not the use of a&#xD;
      procalcitonin(PCT)-based treatment in the daily clinical work could lower the consumption of&#xD;
      antibiotics in patients with lower respiratory tract infections.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      An increasing amount of antibiotics are being consumed and along with the increased&#xD;
      resistance they carry along, they pose an increasing problem for the health sector. A method&#xD;
      to decrease the use of antibiotics is highly desirable and of great importance in order to&#xD;
      halt the spread of multi-resistant bacteria that is becoming an increasing problem in&#xD;
      Denmark.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lower respiratory tract infections such as pneumonia and acute exacerbations of chronic&#xD;
      obstructive pulmonary disease (AECOPD) are frequent reasons for patient contact in both the&#xD;
      primary and secondary sectors. Identifying which patients that could benefit from treatment&#xD;
      with antibiotics is a great challenge to the health sector. This is why patients often are&#xD;
      treated with antibiotics if there is a mere suspicion of the above-mentioned disorders, even&#xD;
      if they are not proved for certain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An increasing amount of data suggests that procalcitonin (PCT) could serve as a possible&#xD;
      marker of respiratory tract infections caused by bacteria. Alongside the conventional&#xD;
      clinical parameters, the level of PCT is regarded as a promising means to decide whether to&#xD;
      treat with antibiotics and how long such a treatment should endure. When an infection is&#xD;
      under control by the immune system of the individual or by treatment with antibiotics, the&#xD;
      level of PCT will diminish by 50% on a daily basis. Accordingly, a decline in the PCT levels&#xD;
      should indicate a favorable response to antibiotic treatment. Therefore there is a need to&#xD;
      further investigate if the PCT levels can be used, in the everyday clinic, to diagnose&#xD;
      patients with pneumonia or AECOPD caused by bacteria and if this could have an effect on the&#xD;
      use of antibiotics, thus optimizing the treatment of the patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this research project is to compare the amount of antibiotics consumed using&#xD;
      standard treatment and treatment based on the PCT levels of patients with lower respiratory&#xD;
      tract infections, respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With the research at hand, a clarification of whether a measurement of PCT can serve as a&#xD;
      diagnostic tool to distinguish between bacterial and non-bacterial infections in patients&#xD;
      that are suspected of having pneumonia or AECOPD is desirable. In extension, this study wants&#xD;
      to clarify if the PCT levels can indicate when a potential antibiotic treatment should be&#xD;
      initiated and if the use of a PCT-based treatment in the daily clinical work could lower the&#xD;
      consumption of antibiotics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis is that PCT will be increased (≥0.25 µg/l and ≥0.10 µg/l for pneumonia and&#xD;
      AECOPD respectively) in lower respiratory tract infections caused by bacteria, whereas PCT&#xD;
      should only be slightly increased in non-bacterial lower respiratory tract infections if at&#xD;
      all. It is expected that using a PCT-based treatment in lower respiratory tract infections&#xD;
      could lower the consumption of antibiotics, while at the same time it should not prove a&#xD;
      greater health risk to patients than by using a standard treatment.&#xD;
