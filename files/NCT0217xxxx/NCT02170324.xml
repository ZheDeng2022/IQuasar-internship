  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Adipose tissues, which include white adipose tissue (WAT) and brown adipose tissue (BAT),&#xD;
      play an essential role in regulating whole-body energy homeostasis. Excess expansion of WAT&#xD;
      due to positive energy balance and defects in thermogenic gene expression in BAT are&#xD;
      associated with obesity and various metabolic diseases. Until 2009 the question of whether&#xD;
      adult humans had BAT and whether it could conceivably contribute to whole body energy usage&#xD;
      in a meaningful way was a matter of vigorous debate. The publication of three apppers in the&#xD;
      New England Journal of Medicine that demonstrated adult humans do have BAT, that it can be&#xD;
      activated, and that this activation appears to be defective in obesity reframed the debate,&#xD;
      and revived interest in BAT physiology. Recent studies also reveal the presence of a subset&#xD;
      of cells in WAT that could be induced by environmental or hormonal factors to become&#xD;
      ''brown-like'' cells, and this ''beigeing'' process has been suggested to have strong&#xD;
      antiobesity and antidiabetic benefits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The extrapancreatic actions of glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) on endothelial cells and the&#xD;
      liver have been reported. Additionally, effects of GLP-1 on adipose tissue have been&#xD;
      described. Studies performed in isolated adipocytes have demonstrated that GLP-1 has the&#xD;
      ability to induce both lipogenic and lipolytic mechanisms in white adipose tissue (WAT) .&#xD;
      More recent study showed that GLP-1 agonism stimulates brown adipose tissue thermogenesis and&#xD;
      browning through hypothalamic AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) in animal. However, there&#xD;
      is no data clearly show that GLP-1 agonism stimulates browning of subcutaneous white adipose&#xD;
      tissue (SWAT) in human obesity.&#xD;

      Individuals were treated for 10 days. Biopsy for subcutaneous white adipose (1.5X1.5X1.5cm)&#xD;
      was performed before and after 10 days treatment programme under local anesthesia. Measure&#xD;
      the brown fat characteristics of biopsy samples.The sample was immediately processed in 3&#xD;
      sections.One part was stored for immunohistology and western blot, the second was snap-frozen&#xD;
      for estimation of biochemical markers, and the remainder was used to harvest small&#xD;
      subcutaneous arteries with micro-dissection. Also, the perivascular adipose tissue (PVAT) was&#xD;
      studied on the changes of morphology and possible signal pathways before and after GLP-1&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;

    <description>Brown fat characteristics of biopsy samples will be assessed by determining the expression levels of uncoupling protein-1 (UCP-1), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)-r, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor r coactivator 1 a (PGC1a) , growth factor receptor binding protein-10 (Grb10), PR domain containing 16 (PRDM16); In addition, a combination of PET and computed tomography (CT) - with the glucose analogue 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG) as a tracer will be performed for brown adipose tissue before and after GLP-1 agonism treatment programme.</description>
