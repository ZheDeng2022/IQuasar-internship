    <textblock>
      This research study because is looking at woman with symptoms of chronic pelvic pain caused&#xD;
      by short, tight, and tender pelvic floor muscles (Myofascial Pelvic Pain syndrome). The&#xD;
      purpose of this study is to determine whether or not injections with onabotulinumtoxinA&#xD;
      (Botox) improve symptoms of pain and tenderness. The drug being studied, Botox is FDA&#xD;
      approved for other uses. However, Botox is not FDA approved for the use in myofascial pelvic&#xD;
      pain (MPP). Therefore, Botox is considered experimental or research in this study.&#xD;

      BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE: Chronic pelvic pain affects 15-20% of the female population aged&#xD;
      18-50 years and accounts for up to 10% of gynecologic visits each year resulting in a cost of&#xD;
      2.8 billion dollars annually to the health care system. It is defined as non-menstrual&#xD;
      (non-cyclic) pain that occurs on an average of two weeks per month for at least six months'&#xD;
      duration; localized to the anatomic pelvis, anterior abdominal wall below the umbilicus,&#xD;
      buttocks, or lumbosacral back. Many affected patients are noted to have severely short and&#xD;
      tight pelvic floor muscles on examination (termed MPP), resulting in pelvic floor trigger&#xD;
      points which may cause associated pelvic symptoms, including: dyspareunia, urinary urgency&#xD;
      and frequency, symptoms of a urinary tract infection, and pelvic discomfort or heaviness.As a&#xD;
      result of the constant, severe pain and associated symptoms, women with chronic pelvic pain&#xD;
      are more likely to experience a decrease in their quality of life, depression, and anxiety&#xD;
      towards their condition. The difficulty in treating chronic pelvic pain is that the etiology&#xD;
      can be varied and multifactorial. Frequently associated with an abnormal response to an acute&#xD;
      injury such as a pelvic infection, traumatic birth, and endometriosis or repetitive insult&#xD;
      like chronic constipation, chronic pelvic pain can also result from prolonged pelvic floor&#xD;
      muscle spasm and muscular hypertonicity. Specialized examination of the pelvic floor&#xD;
      musculature in patients with chronic pelvic pain will often reveal MPP as well as 'trigger&#xD;
      points'.11 This pain is perpetuated as a result of modifications in the neuronal pathways&#xD;
      which maintain a set pattern of pain sensations including increased pain sensitivity&#xD;
      (hyperalgesia), referred pain, and even changes in tissue make-up. The treatment of MPP must&#xD;
      therefore treat the inciting injury and modify the tissue response. The effects of&#xD;
      onabotulinumtoxinA on painful muscle were first suggested by the effects of toxin injection&#xD;
      in patients with migraine headache. While undergoing onabotulinumtoxinA injection for&#xD;
      cosmetic purposes, patients also suffering from migraine headaches found symptom improvement.&#xD;
      Further follow-up studies demonstrated a 51% complete resolution and 38% a partial response&#xD;
      noted of migraine symptoms within in 1 to 2 hours of treatment among true migraine patients.&#xD;
      Although the mechanism of action remains unclear, onabotulinumtoxinA is believed to act by&#xD;
      denervating autonomic nerves, thereby altering peripheral sensory nerve function and&#xD;
      interrupting the migraine cycle of pain. The trigeminal neurovascular theory of migraine pain&#xD;
      suggests that onabotulinumtoxinA acts not only causing muscle paralysis, but also inhibiting&#xD;
      the transmission of any vesicles from the synaptic junction, including vasoactive intestinal&#xD;
      peptide. This blockage of any neuromuscular junction transmission inhibits any muscle&#xD;
      activity or efferent pain signals. Interestingly, though muscle paralysis takes about one&#xD;
      week to manifest, pain relief occurs in 1 to 2 hours and although flaccid paralysis last for&#xD;
      approximately 3 months, benefits for migraine pain last much longer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY RATIONALE: In MPP syndrome, prolonged muscle contraction, spasm, and inappropriately&#xD;
      high muscle tone are thought to diminish blood supply and increase oxygen demand of the&#xD;
      muscles of the pelvic floor. Ischemic muscle may secrete pain-producing substances, which&#xD;
      further sensitize muscle nociceptors, alter receptor field properties, and convert wide-band&#xD;
      mechanoreceptors to nociceptors. OnabotulinumtoxinA can directly block cholinergic&#xD;
      neuromuscular transmission and interrupt the cascade of events that lead to hyperalgesia and&#xD;
      allodynia. onabotulinumtoxinA plays a direct role by blocking the alpha- and gamma-motor&#xD;
      neurons, thereby preventing the abnormal pattern of muscle contraction (eg, spasm, dystonia)&#xD;
      that activates muscle nociceptors and sensitizes the muscle pain system through mediators.The&#xD;
      investigators division has been utilizing pelvic floor injections of onabotulinumtoxinA as an&#xD;
      off-label treatment for MPP in conjunction with pelvic floor physical therapy for more than 6&#xD;
      years. In patients with severe MPP, who often unable to tolerate any vaginal exam, or those&#xD;
      receiving no further reduction in pelvic pain with extensive physical therapy, the&#xD;
      investigators have been utilizing the injection of 100 U of onabotulinumtoxinA into pelvic&#xD;
      floor trigger points with significant success. Anecdotally, treated patients report a 30-40%&#xD;
      reduction in their pain complaints 7-10 days post-treatment which lasts for approximately 3&#xD;
      months. Even when the pain recurs, it is not as severe as it was pre-treatment and patients&#xD;
      take the opportunity of the window of reduced pain to maximize further progress with pelvic&#xD;
      floor physical therapy. Two to four weeks after pelvic floor injection, patients with severe&#xD;
      MPP reported statistically significant changes in VAS scores before and after&#xD;
      onabotulinumtoxinA treatment with a median reduction in VAS of -3.9 (CI for changed score&#xD;
      -2.2, -5.6, p&lt;0.001). Eighty percent of patients reported significant subjective improvement&#xD;
      in their pelvic pain lasting more than 4 weeks and anecdotally lasting up to 3 to 4 months in&#xD;
      duration. Adverse events were reported by 22% of patients and were mild, limited to: pelvic&#xD;
      heaviness, increased pain, urinary irritation, and nausea/vomiting. However, despite these&#xD;
      encouraging results, there is no definitive evidence that onabotulinumtoxinA is an effective&#xD;
      treatment modality in patients with severe MPP. In their evidence-based review of the&#xD;
      literature regarding the treatment of refractory pain with onabotulinumtoxinA, Jabbari and&#xD;
      Machado found only level C evidence (possibly effective, may be used at discretion of&#xD;
      clinician) when investigated the role of onabotulinumtoxinAs in the treatment of MPP.&#xD;
      Moreover, less is known regarding the potential side effects of onabotulinumtoxinA injected&#xD;
      into the pelvic floor muscles. Therefore, stronger randomized controlled studies are&#xD;
      necessary to investigate the efficacy and possible side effects of pelvic floor injections of&#xD;
      onabotulinumtoxinA in the treatment of MPP syndrome and this is actually our research&#xD;
      proposal. It is our hope that our study will significantly change current clinical treatment&#xD;
      protocols for MPP syndrome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY DESIGN: This is a phase I study in which participants will be randomized 1:1&#xD;
      (onabotulinumtoxinA:placebo), double-blinded, placebo-controlled clinical trial. Potential&#xD;
      participants are women seeking treatment for MPP as diagnosed by the participating clinical&#xD;
      investigators based on the following criteria: MPP is defined by at least 4 to 5 palpable&#xD;
      trigger points on transvaginal and/or transrectal examination of the pelvic floor, which&#xD;
      reproduces the pain for which they are seeking medical care. A trigger point is defined as an&#xD;
      extremely tender focus of muscle causing pain radiating to other areas specific for each&#xD;
      trigger point. A trigger point is termed 'active' if pain occurs spontaneously, and 'latent'&#xD;
      if palpation and pressure are required to elicit pain, which may replicate symptoms or&#xD;
      radiate to surrounding lower extremity, pelvic and abdominal sites. This study will have two&#xD;
      arms:* Treatment group: 20 patients randomly assigned to receive 100 U onabotulinumtoxinA&#xD;
      reconstituted in 20 ml saline sequentially injected bilaterally into the pubococcygeus,&#xD;
      iliococcygeus, coccygeus, obturator internus, and piriformis muscles. * Placebo group: 20&#xD;
      patients randomly assigned to receive 20 ml of saline bilaterally into the same pelvic floor&#xD;
      muscles. All injections will be performed using a pudendal injection tray in the clinical&#xD;
      treatment area after obtaining consent. The patients will be randomized using a&#xD;
      computer-generated randomization sequences in balanced blocks of four. Both the patients and&#xD;
      physicians will be blinded to the first injection assignment. All participants with&#xD;
      inadequate symptom control (VAS score 7 or more) at 1 months after the injection will have&#xD;
      their treatment unblinded. Those who received placebo (saline) will be offered injection with&#xD;
      open label onabotlulinumA. Those who previously received onabotlulinumA will not be eligible&#xD;
      for reinjection. All patients will be followed for 6 months after the initial injection or&#xD;
      for 6 months following the second injection. All patients who opt for a second injection will&#xD;
      once again begin the outlined injection follow-up visit schedule.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY PROCEDURES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening - A detailed medical and surgical history, demographic information and review of&#xD;
      medications will be taken from all patients suspected of having MPP. Then, a physical exam&#xD;
      and a pelvic floor examination for myofascial trigger points will be performed. It will&#xD;
      include an assessment of VAS at the bilateral pubococcygeus, iliococcygeus, coccygeus,&#xD;
      obturator internus, and piriformis muscles. All VAS scores will be recorded. Post residual&#xD;
      Void (PVR) will be recorded. Patients will have an assessment of their post residual void&#xD;
      (PVR) and the volume will be recorded. Patients who meet inclusion criteria will be offered&#xD;
      study participation. Patients who agree to participate will be formally consented and&#xD;
      complete all pertinent questionnaires: * Short Form 12 (SF-12) for quality of life assessment&#xD;
      * Patient Global Impression Index (PGI-I) for degree of bother from pelvic pain * Pelvic&#xD;
      Floor Distress Inventory (PFDI) and Pelvic Floor Impact Questionnaire (PFIQ - short form 7)&#xD;
      to assess the bladder and bowel functions * Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI) for sexual&#xD;
      function assessment. Currently no validated questionnaire for symptoms of MPP exists.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedure - A pudendal block type needle is gently advanced along the outstretched fingers.&#xD;
      Holding the needle in a near horizontal plane, the pelvic floor muscles are injected in a&#xD;
      systematic fashion starting on the levator ani and then marching backward all the way down&#xD;
      back to the piriformis muscle including the obturator internus muscle. The following muscles&#xD;
      are sequentially injected with 2 cc of diluted onabotulinumtoxinA: pubococcygeus (this muscle&#xD;
      is felt as a sling around the vagina, just proximal to the hymenal ring), iliococcygeus&#xD;
      (palpated superiorly and laterally to pubococcygeus muscle), obturator internus (on the&#xD;
      sidewalls of the pelvis just superior to the arcus tendineus levator ani), coccygeus (half&#xD;
      distance between the ischial spine and sacrum), and piriformis (these muscles are palpated&#xD;
      filling the posterolateral pelvic walls and are injected lateral to the sacrum). Careful&#xD;
      attention is made to withdraw prior to injection to ensure no intravascular injection of the&#xD;
      diluted onabotulinumtoxinA. Once the injection had been performed on one side of the pelvis,&#xD;
      pressure is held for good hemostasis. The same procedure is then performed on the other side.&#xD;
      Peri-procedural adverse events are recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post Procedure Instructions - Post treatment, all patients will be monitored for 15 minutes.&#xD;
      Standardized post-injection instructions are given to the participant verbally and in written&#xD;
      form. Patients will be contacted by telephone within 24-48 hours after the procedure for&#xD;
      safety assessment. The first follow-up evaluation will be scheduled 1 month after pelvic&#xD;
      floor injection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-Up Visits 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 &amp; Visit 8 (Visit 8, only if Patient Received 2nd Injection) -&#xD;
      Follow-up clinic evaluations will occur 1, 2, 3, 4 and 6 months after injection,&#xD;
      respectively. A history will be taken and a physical examination that includes PVR assessment&#xD;
      will be performed at each follow-up visit. VAS scores of pelvic floor muscles will be&#xD;
      recorded. PGI-I, PFDI, PFIQ, and FSFI forms will be collected at each follow-up visit.&#xD;
      Adverse events will be carefully monitored and recorded.&#xD;
