      The prevailing view in telomere epidemiology is that leukocyte telomere length (LTL) is&#xD;
      associated with atherosclerosis and accelerated aging since it serves as a biomarker of the&#xD;
      cumulative burden of inflammation and oxidative stress during adult life. Our recent results&#xD;
      however, indicate that telomere length (TL) is mainly determined at birth and childhood.&#xD;
      Since short telomeres ante cede atherosclerosis, the investigators hypothesize that TL is not&#xD;
      just a simple marker, but a real determinant of arterial aging. That is because TL reflects&#xD;
      cellular repair capacity and a short LTL denotes diminished repair reserves. This hypothesis&#xD;
      cannot be tested by measurements of LTL alone, since this parameter reflects TL at birth and&#xD;
      its age-dependent attrition thereafter. The investigators propose, therefore, a model that&#xD;
      makes it possible to examine different elements of TL dynamics in different tissues:&#xD;
      leukocytes, skeletal muscle, endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs), skin or subcutaneous fat in&#xD;
      patients with or without atherosclerosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our model is based on the following premises, which are derived from observations that TL is&#xD;
      synchronized (equivalent) across somatic tissues/cells of the newborn:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  TL in skeletal muscle mainly reflects TL at birth&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The difference in TL between muscle and leukocytes in adults (approximately 1.5 Kbp)&#xD;
           mainly reflects LTL attrition during the growth period, i.e., childhood/adolescence&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  TL in EPCs determines the cell proliferative ability and therefore capacity for vessels&#xD;
           repair during aging.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The general aim of the present project is to examine the links of arterial aging with TL, as&#xD;
      expressed in different tissues, and LTL dynamics, as expressed in the difference between TLs&#xD;
      of muscle and leukocytes.&#xD;

      Specific objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To determine whether TL during early development, which is primarily reflected in muscle&#xD;
           TL, and LTL attrition during development, which is primarily expressed in the difference&#xD;
           between muscle TL and LTL, are associated with indices of arterial aging.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To examine the relation between EPC-TL to endothelial regenerative capacity and&#xD;
           endothelial function. In order to attain this objective the investigators will perform&#xD;
           two types of experiments:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Measure TL in progenitor cells and relate it to clinical phenotypes of arterial&#xD;
                aging and atherosclerosis, as well as markers of endothelial dysfunction&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Generate in vitro progenitor cells with different TL induced by the environmental&#xD;
                factors (oxidative stress) and assess their phenotypes concerning inflammation and&#xD;
                microvesiculation, in order to show a possible mechanistic relationship between TL&#xD;
                in PC and the atherogenic and the regenerative capacities of these cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The project is composed of 6 tasks:&#xD;
&#xD;
      T1: Recruitment and sample collection (skeletal muscle, total blood) of 170 patients with&#xD;
      atherosclerosis and 170 controls. Performed by surgeons and cardiologists of Marseille and&#xD;
      Nancy University hospitals T2: Characterization of arterial aging in all patients (Geriatric&#xD;
      Dpt, Univ. hospital Nancy, Pr Benetos and AP-HM, Internal Medicine, Marseille, Dr Rossi) T3:&#xD;
      Characterization of early and late endothelial progenitor cells (EPC): laboratory of&#xD;
      hematology and vascular biology and in UMR_S1076 in Marseille (Prs Dignat-George and&#xD;
      Sabatier) T4: Measurements of TL in all samples (skeletal muscle, leukocytes and EPC):&#xD;
      UMR_S1116 Nancy (Dr Lacolley) in collaboration with Pr Aviv (University of Medicine of New&#xD;
      Jersey) T5: Characterization of inflammation markers in blood samples: UMR_S1116 and the&#xD;
      UMR_S1122 (Dr Siest-Visvikis, Nancy) T6: Database construction and statistical analyses&#xD;
      (UMR_S1116)&#xD;
&#xD;
      The results of this program could completely modify the present concept on the association&#xD;
      between TL and cardiovascular risk: Actually, if our concept of early determination of TL is&#xD;
      valid, therefore TL could be a true determinant of the arterial aging pace, through&#xD;
      limitation of repair capacity of cells.&#xD;
