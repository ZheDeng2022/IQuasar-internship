      The prevalence of cardiovascular disease is rising; new methods must be created to assess the&#xD;
      cardiovascular status of patients. If cardiovascular disease can be predicted, it may&#xD;
      facilitate prevention. An association between periodontal disease and cardiovascular has been&#xD;
      established, but a definitive mechanism is not understood. A good first step in finding that&#xD;
      mechanism is to look at the correlation between periodontal disease and cardiovascular&#xD;
      disease, both of which have an inflammatory component. This study observes the level of&#xD;
      cardiovascular disease in patients and correlates it with the presence and degree of&#xD;
      periodontal pathogens.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A possible association between periodontal disease and cardiovascular disease was first&#xD;
      hypothesized in the 1980s. Epidemiological studies performed over the last 20 years have&#xD;
      shown a strong correlation between periodontal disease and cardiovascular disease. However,&#xD;
      the literature is somewhat divided, as some studies have shown moderate correlation while&#xD;
      others have shown independent (insignificant) correlations between the two. This leaves a gap&#xD;
      in the investigators knowledge that must be brought together through specific studies. There&#xD;
      have been reports made to suggest that 52% of atherosclerotic plaques studied have been found&#xD;
      to contain the same pathogens that cause periodontitis. This is the reason that these are the&#xD;
      bacteria that will be focused on during the course of this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Periodontal disease, known as either gingivitis or periodontitis, is caused by the presence&#xD;
      of bacteria in the gingival pockets in the mouth which over time can cause systemic&#xD;
      inflammation through endotoxin production. Some examples of the bacteria that cause&#xD;
      periodontal disease include Porphyromonas gingivalis and Aggregatibacter&#xD;
      actinomycetemcomitans. These are gram-negative, anaerobic bacteria that are able to thrive in&#xD;
      the sub-gingival space after they are able to successfully become established. These two&#xD;
      bacteria have been known to invade oral epithelial cells, creating the possibility that they&#xD;
      could invade epithelial cells elsewhere such as in coronary vessels. These bacteria will be&#xD;
      cultured from the patient and the relative amounts of them as determined by culture&#xD;
      techniques will be used to assess the prevalence of periodontal disease in the patient. P.&#xD;
      gingivalis is of special importance because it is known to be found in patients with active&#xD;
      periodontal disease and not commonly found in patients without periodontal disease. It can be&#xD;
      identified by the black pigment produced upon culture. Tryptic&#xD;
      Soy-Serum-Bacitracin-Vancomycin (TSBV) Agar is a selective medium that is able to isolate A.&#xD;
      actinomycetemcomitans. The identity of A. actinomycetemcomitans can be confirmed based on the&#xD;
      growth of &quot;star-like&quot; colonies on the TSBV Agar that are catalase positive. The relative&#xD;
      amount of these bacteria as determined by culture will be used to correlate with the level of&#xD;
      coronary artery disease based on the groups that each subject is assigned to. This is how the&#xD;
      basis for an association between the two conditions can be determined.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Systemic inflammation occurs as a result of the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines in&#xD;
      response to an infection. Some of the cytokines released, include high sensitivity C-reactive&#xD;
      protein (hs-CRP), interleukin-1 (IL-1), and interleukin-6 (IL-6). Hs-CRP is a protein that is&#xD;
      active during the acute phase response to inflammation. Its level in the blood has been shown&#xD;
      to be markedly raised in chronic inflammation and has consistently been found to be elevated&#xD;
      in patients with acute coronary syndromes. IL-1 is a pro-inflammatory cytokine that is also&#xD;
      released as a result of systemic inflammation. Specifically, it has been found to be secreted&#xD;
      in response to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) from gram-negative bacteria and has been found to be&#xD;
      elevated in patients with increased periodontal disease. IL-6, like IL-1, is a&#xD;
      pro-inflammatory cytokine that is part of the acute phase response to infection. It has been&#xD;
      strongly correlated with increasing levels of coronary artery disease and has even been&#xD;
      demonstrated as a predictive marker of mortality in Coronary Artery Disease (CAD). In&#xD;
      addition to its role in CAD, IL-6 has also been found to be elevated in periodontal disease,&#xD;
      creating the possibility for the basis of the link between these two diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to achieve a better understanding of the relationship between&#xD;
      periodontal disease and coronary artery disease by correlating the severity of coronary&#xD;
      artery disease with the presence and amount of the periodontal pathogens P. gingivalis and A.&#xD;
      actinomycetemcomitans. The level of systemic inflammation caused by these pathogens and and&#xD;
      coronary artery disease will also be assessed. This will determine if coronary artery disease&#xD;
      can be associated with one of these specific pathogens more than the other and what levels of&#xD;
      systemic inflammation can be associated with both of these conditions together.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Samples will be obtained from periodontal tissue, cultured, and the amount of the specified&#xD;
      pathogens present will be correlated with the type and extent of the patient's cardiovascular&#xD;
      disease. Blood tests will also be taken to assess the level of systemic inflammation&#xD;
      occurring as a result of periodontal disease and cardiovascular disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be assigned to one of 3 groups based on their cardiovascular status:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group 1 will include patients with no known history of CAD.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group 2 will include patients with a known history of CAD without previous Myocardial&#xD;
           Infarction (MI).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group 3 will include patients with a known history of CAD and previous MI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Charts for patients to be seen in the Cardiology clinic will be pre-screened by a member of&#xD;
      the study team to determine if the patient is eligible for the study. Patients will be&#xD;
      consented in a private setting and a cardiovascular disease history pertinent to the study&#xD;
      will be taken for each patient who consents to participating in the study. Clean floss that&#xD;
      has been will be used to collect a sample of gingival fluid from between the lower teeth of&#xD;
      the patient. No measures have been taken to sterilize the floss, so appropriate aseptic&#xD;
      techniques including the use of sterile gloves to prevent cross contamination. Three samples&#xD;
      will be collected: in the midline of the teeth, behind the right or left lateral incisor, and&#xD;
      in front of the right or left first molar. The decision to sample the right or left of the&#xD;
      patient's mouth will be randomized (coin flip) unless the patient is missing teeth on one&#xD;
      side and the sample must be taken from the side that will yield a proper sample. At least 2&#xD;
      out of the 3 samples must be obtained. These samples will be placed in 3 labeled (by study&#xD;
      identification number and site of sample) sealed vials of thioglycollate broth and cultured&#xD;
      for 48 hours. A sample will then be removed from the bottom of thioglycollate medium using a&#xD;
      pipette (to extract anaerobic bacteria) and cultured on specific media for the presence of P.&#xD;
      gingivalis, and A. actinomycetemcomitans using anaerobic precautions in the University&#xD;
      Medical Center (UMC) microbiology laboratory. P. gingivalis will be cultured on a specialized&#xD;
      Columbia agar supplemented with sheep's blood, bacitracin, colistin, and nalidixic acid to&#xD;
      select for the isolation of P. gingivalis. A. actinomycetemcomitans can be isolated using a&#xD;
      specialized tryptic soy-serum-bacitracin-vancomycin (TSBV) agar, a specialized agar that&#xD;
      inhibits gram-positive and gram-negative aerobes and anaerobes. Each sample will be streaked&#xD;
      onto an agar plate that has been labeled with the study ID and tooth location. The bacteria&#xD;
      will be cultured using the quad-streak method and cultured for 24-48 hours and the pathogenic&#xD;
      bacteria will be identified. P. gingivalis will be identified based on the growth of black&#xD;
      pigmented colonies on the selective agar and A. actinomycetemcomitans will be identified&#xD;
      based on the growth of star-like colonies on the TSBV agar. The level of periodontal disease&#xD;
      in the patient will be assessed by the amount of growth on the plates, with a number assigned&#xD;
      to each quadrant that the bacteria grow in. if they only grow in the first quadrant, they&#xD;
      will be given a number designation of 1, and growth in the second through fourth quadrants&#xD;
      will be designated by 2 through 4 respectively. Using this method, the level of the bacteria&#xD;
      can be quantified, with 4 being the designation for highest relative amount of bacteria. The&#xD;
      level of each pathogen found in the patients' mouths will be correlated with the severity of&#xD;
      coronary artery disease in order to determine if there is a significant correlation. It will&#xD;
      also be determined if one of the pathogens can be correlated with the severity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to the gingival sampling, a small portion (3 mL or 0.6 tsp) of the patient's&#xD;
      blood will be used to test for hs-CRP, IL-6, and IL-1 as systemic markers of inflammation.&#xD;
      The sample used will be taken during the initial clinic visit when the patient has given&#xD;
      consent and the gingival sample is taken. The sample will be drawn by a nurse in order to&#xD;
      obtain the necessary tests. 1 mL (0.2 tsp) of serum will be drawn for each test (0.6 tsp&#xD;
      total) and sent to the UMC pathology lab for analysis. These levels will be compared to the&#xD;
      normal values of IL-1 (0-5 pg/mL) and IL-6 (5-15 pg/mL) while hs-CRP will be correlated based&#xD;
      on increasing levels. This will allow determination of the level of systemic infection caused&#xD;
      by periodontitis (based on IL-1 level), coronary artery disease (based on hs-CRP level), or&#xD;
      both (based on IL-6 level). Individual results will be recorded for statistical analysis.&#xD;
