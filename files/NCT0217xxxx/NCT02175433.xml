  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of&#xD;
      AGS67E both without and with myeloid growth factor (GF) in subjects with refractory or&#xD;
      relapsed lymphoid malignancies. Immunogenicity and anticancer activity of AGS67E will also be&#xD;
      assessed.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The dose escalation study will have two parts:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Dose Escalation of AGS67E without myeloid growth factor (GF)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Dose Escalation of AGS67E with myeloid growth factor (GF)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be enrolled sequentially into dose cohorts starting with AGS67E without GF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All subjects will receive a single 30 minute intravenous (IV) infusion of AGS67E once every&#xD;
      three weeks. Subjects will continue treatment until disease progression, intolerability of&#xD;
      AGS67E, investigator decision or consent withdrawal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This dose escalation will first determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of AGS67E without&#xD;
      GF and then determine the MTD of AGS67E with GF. Once an MTD has been established, the study&#xD;
      may enroll subjects into respective expansion cohorts of 12 subjects each at doses&#xD;
      recommended by the data review team (DRT) (expansion cohort without GF and/or expansion&#xD;
      cohort with GF).&#xD;
&#xD;
      During dose escalation, the Data Review Team will review cumulative unaudited data on an&#xD;
      interim basis to review subject safety, recommend exploring additional doses and/or&#xD;
      schedules, or the expansion of existing cohorts.&#xD;
