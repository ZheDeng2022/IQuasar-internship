  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the study is to investigate the effect of the combined therapy 18 μg&#xD;
      tiotropium q.d. plus pulmonary rehabilitation versus placebo plus pulmonary rehabilitation on&#xD;
      6-minute walking distance (6MWD) after 7 weeks of treatment in patients with moderate to&#xD;
      severe COPD. The secondary objective of the study includes assessments of the effects of the&#xD;
      combined therapy 18 μg Tiotropium q.d. plus rehabilitation versus placebo plus rehabilitation&#xD;
      on dyspnoea, constant work rate exercise endurance, daily activity and lung volumes. The&#xD;
      third objective of the study is to investigate the correlation between the results of the&#xD;
      6-minute walking test (6MWT), the constant work rate exercise test (CWR) and daily activity.&#xD;

             Patients must have relatively stable airway obstruction with an FEV1 ≤ 65% of&#xD;
             predicted normal and FEV1 ≤ 70% of FVC on visit 1 and 3.&#xD;

             disease is defined as a disease which, in the opinion of the investigator, may either&#xD;
             put the patient at risk because of participation in the study or a disease which may&#xD;
             influence the results of the study or the patient's ability to participate in the&#xD;
             study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Patients with clinically relevant abnormal baseline hematology, blood chemistry or&#xD;
             urinanalysis, if the abnormality defines a disease listed as an exclusion criterion.&#xD;
