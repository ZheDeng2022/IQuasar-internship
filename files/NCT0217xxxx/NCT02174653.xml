    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to evaluate the safety of the intake of EPs® 7630 during a long-term&#xD;
      (4 months) medication. The protective effects of EPs®7630 and its effects during a cold&#xD;
      episode will also be studied.&#xD;

      The main objective of this clinical trial is to evaluate the safety of EPs® 7630 intake -&#xD;
      used as continuous protection and at the onset of cold symptoms - in adult participants&#xD;
      during a long-term (4 months) medication. Due to the sparseness of empirical data in the&#xD;
      population and this setting, no confirmatory hypotheses are formulated and the data will be&#xD;
      analysed descriptively.&#xD;
