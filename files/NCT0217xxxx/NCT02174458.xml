      Body contouring (BC) surgery after major weight loss (MWL) requires extensive and multiple&#xD;
      procedures. Yet, there are inconsistent data regarding the outcome after BC procedures. The&#xD;
      aim of this study is to investigate the outcome from patients who elect to have BC procedures&#xD;
      after MWL treated at a single metropolitan tertiary referral center.&#xD;

      Background The obesity epidemic worldwide continues to worsen, with rates in Europe and North&#xD;
      America estimated at about 20-30% of the adult population.(Vico et al., 2010) It is defined&#xD;
      as a body mass index (BMI) above 30, and morbid obesity as a BMI above 40kgm-2.(Strauch et&#xD;
      al., 2006; Vico et al., 2010) As a consequence, there is an explosive growth of&#xD;
      obesity-associated comorbidities, associated with high healthcare costs.(Reiffel et al.,&#xD;
      2013) One of the few consistent means of achieving a significant weight-loss in morbidly&#xD;
      obese patients is bariatric surgery (BS).(Buchwald et al., 2004; Maggard et al., 2005)&#xD;
      Shermak et al. defined massive weight loss (MWL) as 50% or greater loss of excess&#xD;
      weight.(Shermak et al., 2006) Next to the amelioration of the medical comorbidities&#xD;
      associated with obesity, patients also benefit from improvement in their psychosocial&#xD;
      functioning, personal health perceptions and health-related quality of life.(Karlsson et al.,&#xD;
      1998; Karlsson et al., 2007; Sarwer et al., 2008) A major drawback after BS is the&#xD;
      persistence of large quantities of excess and inelastic skin and subcutaneous tissue. Thus,&#xD;
      patients often experience skin irritations, mycotic infections and secondary self-imaging&#xD;
      problems.(Reiffel et al., 2013; Vico et al., 2010) Body contouring (BC) surgery, usually&#xD;
      excisional, includes (circumferential) abdominoplasty, breast reduction, panniculectomy,&#xD;
      brachioplasty, and thigh lift. It removes the excess tissue which remains after massive&#xD;
      weight loss and consecutively leads to a significant improvement in self-image and&#xD;
      self-esteem, as well as mobility, overall daily functioning and hygiene.(Larsen et al., 2007;&#xD;
      Song et al., 2006) These procedures are usually multiple and extensive. Thus, combining and&#xD;
      reducing the number of such procedures while obtaining optimal results would be most&#xD;
      beneficial to both the surgeon and the patient.(Ellabban and Hart, 2004; Hallock and&#xD;
      Altobelli, 1985) For patients who seek BS, quality of life is an important issue. In a recent&#xD;
      study by Modarressi et al. it has been shown that Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGBP) improves&#xD;
      the health-related quality of life (HRQoL). Furthermore, it was shown that HRQoL is directly&#xD;
      related to weight loss and BC procedures further improves HRQoL in comparison to RYGBP alone,&#xD;
      as evidenced by the Moorehead-Ardelt questionnaire.(Modarressi et al., 2013; Oria and&#xD;
      Moorehead, 1998) Nevertheless, there is an urgent need to develop specific and&#xD;
      well-constructed patient reported outcome (PRO) instruments in order to obtain reliable&#xD;
      information regarding QoL and patient satisfaction following BC surgery in MWL&#xD;
      patients.(Jabir, 2013)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical Data In the literature there are some inconsistent data regarding QoL scales after&#xD;
      BC procedures.(Singh et al., 2012) Problems after MWL with excessive skin folds compromises&#xD;
      body image and may negatively impact the physical and mental components of QoL.(Mitchell et&#xD;
      al., 2008) Thus, theoretically, after removal of skin excess, the QoL scales should improve&#xD;
      after BC procedures. Indeed, several studies have demonstrated improvements in QoL associated&#xD;
      with BC surgery.(Coriddi et al., 2011; Pecori et al., 2007; Song et al., 2006; van der Beek&#xD;
      et al., 2010) However, in a recent study by Singh et al., scales comprising the mental&#xD;
      component were lower in the group of patients who received BC procedures, indicating impaired&#xD;
      QoL.(Singh et al., 2012) Of those, role-emotional and social functioning were significantly&#xD;
      lower than both the control and the post-bariatric surgery group, showing that those patients&#xD;
      who elected to have BC procedures suffer from worsening inhibited social interactions.(Singh&#xD;
      et al., 2012) It might be arguable that patients in the post-bariatric surgery group who&#xD;
      elected not to undergo BC chose so because their QoL was already high.(Singh et al., 2012)&#xD;
      Thus, counseling and education prior to plastic surgery is extremely important to ensure&#xD;
      appropriate expectations for the patient in regard to scarring and the realistic scope that&#xD;
      can be accomplished by surgery.(Singh et al., 2012) QoL, especially in women aged between 35&#xD;
      to 64 years old, is the most affected domain in patients with BMI &gt; 40kg/m2.(Larsson et al.,&#xD;
      2002) This dissatisfaction motivates different behaviours, including exercise, weight loss&#xD;
      and cosmetic surgery.(Sarwer et al., 2008) Thus, despite obesity is more prevalent in men, it&#xD;
      might explain partially why women more frequently seek bariatric surgery.(Modarressi et al.,&#xD;
      2013) Following BS, patients are initially enthusiastic to see cure of their diabetes,&#xD;
      decreased pain in their joints and weight loss.(Colwell, 2010) Nevertheless, the skin does&#xD;
      not contract with the volume loss.(Colwell, 2010) As soon as the weight has been stable for&#xD;
      at least 6 months, plastic surgical evaluation seems to be appropriate.(Colwell, 2010) In&#xD;
      general, the lower the BMI at the time of BC surgery, the better the result.(Langer et al.,&#xD;
      2011) Usually, condouting procedures are preserved for those patients who attain a BMI less&#xD;
      than or equal to 35.(Arthurs et al., 2007) To date, little is known about the frequency and&#xD;
      proportions of patients who undergo BS and consequently receive BC surgery. Reasons for not&#xD;
      undergoing body contouring procedures can be the lack of awareness regarding options and&#xD;
      expense.(Reiffel et al., 2013) Documentation of functional problems, such as rashes, sexual&#xD;
      dysfunction and difficulty with exercise are important in attempting to obtain insurance&#xD;
      coverage for at least part of their surgery.(Arthurs et al., 2007) Panniculectomy, defined as&#xD;
      removal of excess skin and fat in the abdomen without umbilical transpostion, is the surgical&#xD;
      procedure most likely to be covered by insurance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Usually, truncal deformity is the most common presenting complaint of MWL patients, and the&#xD;
      procedure of choice is a lower body lift.(Colwell, 2010) It is crucial to focus&#xD;
      postoperatively on patient safety prioritizing in seroma prevention and deep vein thrombosis&#xD;
      (DVT) prophylaxis. Reported complication rates postoperative range between 17-50% including&#xD;
      wound-healing problems, haematoma, infection, necrosis or pulmonary embolism.(Vico et al.,&#xD;
      2010) Furthermore, many of these patients have psychiatric problems, and thus counseling,&#xD;
      especially in the perioperative period is extremely important.(Langer et al., 2011) The&#xD;
      number of procedures that can safely be performed in one sitting depends on the patient's&#xD;
      anatomy, the surgeon, the surgical facility and overall medical health.(Arthurs et al., 2007)&#xD;
      The patient's BMI should be normal or slightly overweight. Otherwise, staging the procedures&#xD;
      into two or more surgeries separated by 3-6 months is suggested.(Arthurs et al., 2007)&#xD;
      Ideally, the operative time should be kept under six hours or below to minimize&#xD;
      complications.(Langer et al., 2011) Obviously, if vectors of pull at surgery are in opposite&#xD;
      directions, such as in an upper body lift and a belt lipectomy/lower body lift, these&#xD;
      procedures should be performed separately.(Langer et al., 2011) In a study by Ellabban et&#xD;
      al., 14 patients were evaluated who underwent BC operations using combined abdominoplasty and&#xD;
      medial thigh reduction. The authors concluded that combined abdominoplasty with vertical&#xD;
      medial thigh reduction is effective in correcting aesthetic and physical problems after&#xD;
      massive weight reduction with an excellent predictable outcome.(Ellabban and Hart, 2004)&#xD;
      Also, combined brachioplasty, thoracoplasty, and mammoplasty has proven to be safe,&#xD;
      effective, and beneficial for both the surgeon and patient.(Hallock and Altobelli, 1985) In&#xD;
      order to establish an evidence base to support the idea that BC is as much (or even more) a&#xD;
      functional procedure as it is cosmetic, a flurry of studies assessing QoL and patient&#xD;
      satisfaction following BC surgery has been resulted.(Jabir, 2013) The method of choice to&#xD;
      assess QoL and patient satisfaction is to use patient specific psychometrically validated PRO&#xD;
      measures.(Jabir, 2013) To date, none of the measures have been specifically developed for BC&#xD;
      surgery patients. Instead, there is an urgent need to develop specific and well- constructed&#xD;
      PRO instruments in order to obtain reliable information regarding QoL and patient&#xD;
      satisfaction after BC surgery in MWL patients.(Jabir, 2013)&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY OBJECTIVES The main objective of this research is to analyse QoL and patient&#xD;
      satisfaction after BC surgery in MWL male and female patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We hypothesize that &gt;80% of the patients have a total score of +2.25 to +3 (&quot;much better&quot;) or&#xD;
      +0.75 to +2 (&quot;better&quot;) in the Moorehead-Ardelt questionnaire. 66 patients of equal&#xD;
      distribution and demographic characteristics after bariatric surgery but no secondary&#xD;
      reconstructive procedure will serve as a control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The associated research questions are as follows:&#xD;

&#xD;
      Primary outcome:&#xD;
&#xD;
      After a mean follow-up of 8.9±3.5 years after BC surgery we hypothesize that &gt;90% of the 66&#xD;
      patients will answer the survey. Based on the literature(Modarressi et al., 2013), we expect&#xD;
      that &gt;80% of the patients have a total score of +2.25 to +3 (&quot;much better&quot;) or +0.75 to +2&#xD;
      (&quot;better&quot;) in the Moorehead-Ardelt questionnaire.&#xD;

    <description>The Moorehead-Ardelt(Oria and Moorehead, 1998) questionnaire is the HRQoL part of the &quot;Bariatric Analysis and Reporting Outcome System&quot;. This questionnaire was created to specifically evaluate the outcome of bariatric surgery, and it is widely used by national and international bariatric surgery associations. It evaluates five domains of HRQoL: self-esteem, physical activity, social life, work ability and sexual activity. For each domain, patient evaluates &quot;much better&quot;, &quot;better&quot;, &quot;same&quot;, &quot;worse&quot; or &quot;much worse&quot; his status on the time that he answers to the questionnaire in comparison to his status before bariatric surgery. Results are summarized in a total score (-3.0 to +3.0) which is the sum of the self-esteem score (-1 to +1) and the four other domains (-0.5 to +0.5 for each). Total score is estimated as &quot;much better&quot; (scores +2.25 to +3), &quot;better&quot; (+0.75 to +2), &quot;same&quot; (+0.5 to -0.5), &quot;worse&quot; (-0.75 to -2 points) and &quot;much worse&quot; (-2.25 to -3).(Modarressi et al., 2013)</description>
