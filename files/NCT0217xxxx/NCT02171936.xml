  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In the care of the chronic pain in pain's department, pain consultation or Evaluation and&#xD;
      Treatment of the Pain Center (CETD), the patients are often in a situation of physical and&#xD;
      psychic suffering which requires a multidisciplinary follow-up. So, 19 percent of the chronic&#xD;
      painful patients lost their employment, are &quot;disintegrated&quot; because of their pain, this being&#xD;
      able to provocate a loss of their financial autonomy. A large number of painful patients thus&#xD;
      find themselves in situations of social vulnerability even of precariousness often denied and&#xD;
      difficult to detect by the caring team. Precarity is define as &quot; the lack of one or several&#xD;
      securities, in particular the employment, allowing the people and the families to assume&#xD;
      their professional, family or social obligations, and to enjoy their fundamental rights.&quot; To&#xD;
      allow a earlier identification of the populations in deprivation situation, the questionnaire&#xD;
      EPICES (Evaluation of the Precariousness and the Disparities of health for the Centers of&#xD;
      Examination of Health (CES)) was administered to more than 7000 people. The individual score,&#xD;
      indicator of the precariousness and the disparities of health, is calculated after answer to&#xD;
      11 questions and was calculated on about 200 000 French people. Among numerous indicators, it&#xD;
      appears that the consumption of psychotropics or a negative perception of the health are&#xD;
      socioeconomic indicators, mode of life and health which are prevailing according to the&#xD;
      quintiles of the score EPICES.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This national study, on the French CETD aims is: 1 - to study prevalence of the social&#xD;
      vulnerability even of the precariousness thanks to adapted questionnaires of which the&#xD;
      questionnaire EPICES, 2 - to identify predictive social-economic factors which generate and&#xD;
      amplify this circumstance, 3 - to identify the patients for whom a situation of&#xD;
      precariousness and social vulnerability is proved true, justifying the earlier orientation&#xD;
      towards the social worker of the Center so allowing a &quot;global&quot; care of the patient during the&#xD;
      second visit&#xD;

      This national study is the first study on the chronic pain and the social vulnerability, as&#xD;
      well at the level national as international because at this day there is no international&#xD;
      publication dealing with this problem which begins to emerge in the structures setting in&#xD;
      charge of the patients suffering of chronic pain. A recent article (Denk and al, on 2014)&#xD;
      underlines the importance to look for the predictive factors of the chronic pain. This&#xD;
      epidemiological study of prevalence of the social vulnerability even of the precariousness as&#xD;
      well as predictive factors of this circumstance will allow to identify the patients with risk&#xD;
      in a earlier way and to refer them as soon as possible for a support in the social domain. In&#xD;
      a completely empirical way we notice important obstacles of psychosocial and societal order&#xD;
      during the therapeutic care of the patients. This study will allow to bring important&#xD;
      information on a troop about one thousand patients distributed on the French CETD.&#xD;

Patient which have a score EPICES ≥ 30, 2. will be considered as &quot; vulnerable socially or precarious&quot; and will came for a second consultation in the center of Evaluation and Treatment of the Pain, to benefit an earlier orientation and better adapted with a social worker.</description>
