  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The major goal of this project is to characterize the structural and functional development&#xD;
      of cortical plate and white matter of the human neonatal brain from the equivalent 30&#xD;
      gestational weeks to 45 gestational weeks. The project is sponsored by niH R01MH092535.&#xD;
      Furthermore, it is related to the blue print project of transcriptome atlas (niH RC2MH089921)&#xD;
      with at least 36 million funding also sponsored by niH.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Revealing detailed anatomy at different equivalent gestational ages of human neonatal brain&#xD;
      not only aids in understanding this highly ordered process, but also provides clues to detect&#xD;
      abnormalities caused by genetic or environmental factors. Cerebral vascular measurements&#xD;
      offer important information on cerebral metabolism. However, either anatomical or functional&#xD;
      studies of human brain development during this period are surprisingly scarce. Diffusion&#xD;
      tensor imaging (DTi), a recently developed technology of magnetic resonance imaging (MRi), is&#xD;
      capable of noninvasively delineating macroscopic anatomical components with high contrast and&#xD;
      revealing structures at the microscopic level. Cerebral vascular quantification including&#xD;
      cerebral blood flow (CBF) and cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen (CMRo2) can also be obtained&#xD;
      through noninvasive MRi, specifically arterial spin labeling (aSL) and T2-relaxation under&#xD;
      spin tagging (TRuST) MRi. in this proposed study, the structure and function of neonatal&#xD;
      brain will be explored using noninvasive MRi technologies. 102 infants will be recruited and&#xD;
      no sedation will be applied during MRi. The resultant database will provide reference&#xD;
      standards for diagnostic radiology of premature newborns and reveal the vascular activities&#xD;
      of these newborn brains. Specifically, three aims will be achieved:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To delineate the anatomical development of complex structure in the cerebral wall and&#xD;
           white matter tracts of neonatal brains at different equivalent gestational ages.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To quantify the cerebral blood flow and metabolic rate of oxygen of neonatal brain.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To correlate the structural and functional measurements with the gene transcriptome&#xD;
           results.&#xD;

      102 normal infants with age of 30 gestational weeks to 45 gestational weeks will be recruited&#xD;
      in partnership with Division of Perinatal-neonatal Medicine which consists of neonatologists&#xD;
      and pediatricians providing services in Parkland Health and Hospital System (PHHS) and&#xD;
      Children's Medical Center (CMC) at Dallas. among 102 normal infants, there are 17 subjects at&#xD;
      each following subgroup, 30-31 gestational weeks, 32-33 gestational weeks, 34-35 gestational&#xD;
      weeks, 36-38 gestational weeks, 39-42 gestational week and 43-45 gestational weeks. once&#xD;
      these infants are identified, structural and functional MRi data will be acquired with&#xD;
      Philips 3T located at Radiology of CMC. The sequence details are as follows: DTi: a&#xD;
      single-shot echo-planar imaging (ePi) sequence with SenSe parallel imaging scheme&#xD;
      (SenSitivity encoding, reduction factor [?]2.5) will be used. The imaging matrix will be&#xD;
      112x112 with a field of view of 168x168mm (nominal resolution of 1.5mm), which will be zero&#xD;
      filled to 256x256. axial slices of 1.5mm thickness will be acquired parallel to the&#xD;
      anterior-posterior commissure line (aC-PC). a total of 65 slices will cover the entire&#xD;
      hemisphere and brainstem without gap. The diffusion weighting will be encoded along 30&#xD;
      independent orientations and b value will be 1000s/mm2. imaging time for each sequence will&#xD;
      be 5 minutes and 30 seconds. To increase signal noise ratio (SnR), two repetitions will be&#xD;
      performed, resulting in DTi imaging time 11 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      T1/T2-weighted imaging: Co-registered T2 weighted image, using a spin echo sequence, will be&#xD;
      acquired with the echo time 120ms. Repetition time (TR) will be 4,500ms. The imaging&#xD;
      resolution will be same as that of DTi. Co-registered FLaiR (Fluid attenuated inversion&#xD;
      Recovery) T1 weighted image will also be acquired with the same field of view as that in&#xD;
      diffusion tensor imaging. The T1/T2 weighted imaging time will be 5 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Resting state fMRi: Time series of 240 volumes of BoLD (Blood-oxygenation-Level-Dependent)&#xD;
      images will be acquired with a single-shot gradient-recalled T2* weighted ePi pulse sequence.&#xD;
      The details of the sequence are as follows: TR [?] 1500 ms; flip angle [?] 90o; slice&#xD;
      thickness[?]2.5mm; matrix [?] 68 x 68; FoV [?] 168 mm x 168 mm; voxel size[?]2.5x2.5x2.5mm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      aSL and TRuST: Pseudo-Continuous aSL (PCaSL) sequence combined with a phase-contrast sequence&#xD;
      will be used to obtain voxel level CBF estimation in units of ml blood per 100 g of tissue&#xD;
      per min (ml/100g/min). The PCaSL sequence will be: field of view [?] 168x168mm,&#xD;
      matrix[?]84x84, slice thickness[?]2mm, 50 axial slices acquired with zero gap, voxel&#xD;
      size[?]2x2x2mm, SenSe factor[?]2.5. The phase contrast MRi will be performed with the slice&#xD;
      location perpendicular to the four major feeding arteries (left/right internal carotid and&#xD;
      vertebral arteries) at the level of cervical spine 3 (C3). Baseline venous oxygenation (Yv)&#xD;
      will be determined in the sagittal sinus using a recently developed&#xD;
      T2-Relaxation-under-Spin-Tagging (TRuST) MRi technique. The imaging parameters will be: voxel&#xD;
      size 3.44x3.44x5mm3, four different T2-weightings with Tes of 0ms, 40ms, 80ms and 160ms,&#xD;
      duration 1 minutes and 12 seconds. The imaging slice will be positioned axially to intersect&#xD;
      the superior sagittal sinus at the level of approximately 10mm above the sinus congruence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Single voxel MRS: Single voxel proton MRS with short Te will be acquired. PReSS (Point&#xD;
      ReSolved Spectroscopy) will be used.&#xD;
