    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study was to investigate patients acceptability / preference of&#xD;
      Berodual® Respimat® inhaler as compared to the conventional Berodual® Metered Aerosol (MA)&#xD;
      inhaler. Ease of handling and assembling the Respimat® inhaler at home under real life&#xD;
      conditions was also evaluated.&#xD;

             least 4 weeks prior to study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients should be able to perform all study related tests including using a peak flow&#xD;
             meter, to perform acceptable PEFR measurements, and should be able to maintain records&#xD;
             (Patient Daily Diary Cards) during the study period as required in the protocol&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  All patients must sign and Informed Consent Form prior to participation in the trial,&#xD;

             or a disease which may influence the results of the study or the patient's ability to&#xD;
             participate in the study&#xD;
