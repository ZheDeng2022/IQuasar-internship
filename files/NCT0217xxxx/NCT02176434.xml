    <textblock>
      This pilot study of combined kidney and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation attempts to&#xD;
      establish a protocol to induce immunological tolerance as a new strategy to prevent renal&#xD;
      graft rejection. If successful, this strategy would restore renal function, while avoiding&#xD;
      the risks associated with long-term standard anti-rejection therapy, and would represent the&#xD;
      first option to cure end-stage renal disease.&#xD;

      Trial design This is an open-label feasibility study of combined Human Leukocyte Antigen&#xD;
      (HLA)-matched sibling hematopoietic stem cell and kidney transplantation. The study will be&#xD;
      performed at the University Hospital of Zurich. The pilot study will include 5 to 8 donors&#xD;
      and 5 to 8 recipients. We expect that 4 out of 5 recipients should be off immunosuppressive&#xD;
      therapy at 6-12 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study protocol&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Non-study-specific interventions before transplantation Donor and recipients will be&#xD;
           screened according to the established internal guidelines for living donor kidney and&#xD;
           hematopoietic stem cell transplantation of the Transplantation Center of the University&#xD;
           Hospital Zurich.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Study-specific interventions before transplantation&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Potential candidates will be informed about this study by the treating physician.&#xD;
                Interested patients will be informed in details about the study protocol, the&#xD;
                potential benefits and risks. The patient will have sufficient time to decide to&#xD;
                participate to this study or to undergo standard transplantation, to read and sing&#xD;
                the informed consent form.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Total lymphoid irradiation: for the optimal planning of the total lymphoid&#xD;
                irradiation, a mapping CT will be performed 2-4 weeks before therapy and repeated&#xD;
                on day 1 after kidney transplantation.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Blood draw for establishment of chimerism determination.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  The recipient will undergo one leukapheresis procedure before starting the&#xD;
                conditioning regimen in order to bank cells for future scientific studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Stem cell mobilization and isolation in the donor by leukapheresis will be&#xD;
                performed according to the standard protocols of the Stem cell transplantation&#xD;
                center of the University Hospital Zurich&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Donor-derived hematopoietic progenitor cells will be isolated from peripheral&#xD;
                leukocytes by positive selection (CD34+ cells) using the Magnetic-Activated Cell&#xD;
                Sorting (MACS) technology according to SOPs of the certified hematology laboratory&#xD;
                of the University Children's Hospital Zurich. CD34 negative cells will be analyzed&#xD;
                by Fluorescence-Activated Cell Sorting (FACS) to determine the amount of CD3&#xD;
                positive cells. Stem cells and flow through will be frozen until the transplant&#xD;
                according to standard operating procedure (SOP) at the stem cell transplantation&#xD;
                center at the University Hospital Zurich.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Since irradiation might reduce fertility the possibility of sperm conservation&#xD;
                before transplantation will be offered to male recipients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Induction protocol&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Kidney transplantation (day 0)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  A CT scan will be performed at day 1 after transplantation for a correct definitive&#xD;
                plan of the irradiation protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Immunosuppression: in the first weeks after kidney transplantation the recipients&#xD;
                will be treated with standard immunosuppression, including methylprednisolone,&#xD;
                prednisone, mycophenolate mofetil and cyclosporine A.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Additionally the patient will be treated with:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Rabbit anti-thymocyte globulin (ATG): Thymoglobuline® 1.5 mg per kg; 5 daily injections&#xD;
           from day 0 to day 4.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Total lymphoid irradiation: 10 doses of 120 centigray (cGy) (total dose 12 Gy) each to&#xD;
           the supradiaphragmatic lymph nodes, thymus, subdiaphragmatic lymph nodes and spleen; 10&#xD;
           daily doses from day 1 to day 11.&#xD;
&#xD;
           • Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (day 11 after kidney transplantation):&#xD;
           Infusion of isolated CD34+ hematopoietic progenitor cells (≥10x10^6 cells/kg)&#xD;
           Additionally the patients will receive 1x10^6 CD3+ T cells / kg body weight from the&#xD;
           CD34- fraction to promote the engraftment of hematopoietic progenitor cells (T cell&#xD;
           add-back)&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Immunosuppression and anti-microbial prophylaxis&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Methylprednisolone: steroids will be rapidly tapered during the first days after&#xD;
                transplantation. All patients will be off of steroids at day 14.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Mycophenolate mofetil: 2 g per day, started at day 11 (4 to 6 hours after stem cell&#xD;
                transplantation) and discontinued 1 month after stem cell transplantation.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Cyclosporine A:&#xD;
&#xD;
      First 3 months: whole blood through level (C0) 250-300 µg/ml&#xD;
&#xD;
      Month 3-6: cyclosporine will be tapered and discontinued at about 6 months if following&#xD;
      criteria will be fulfilled:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Sustained chimerism for at least 180 days&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  No clinical signs of rejection&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Protocol biopsy showing no evidence of acute or chronic rejection&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  No clinical signs of graft versus host disease&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Anti-microbial prophylaxis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Amoxicillin/clavulanic acid 2.2 g preoperatively Sulfamethoxazole/Trimethoprim for 6 months&#xD;
      Valganciclovir: a) low risk (D-R-) - no prophylaxis; b) intermediate risk (R+) - prophylaxis&#xD;
      with valganciclovir 450mg once daily, starting after 1 month post transplant; c) high risk&#xD;
      (D+R-) - prophylaxis with valganciclovir 450mg once daily, starting immediately after&#xD;
      transplantation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      5 Post-operative monitoring&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Donor and recipient will be followed life-long in the outpatient clinic of the&#xD;
           nephrology division according to local practice. During immunosuppression tapering and&#xD;
           in the first months off of immunosuppression renal function will be closely monitored&#xD;
           for an early detection of rejection episodes. Therefore, to participate to the study the&#xD;
           patient has to agree with a weekly creatinine testing, which might also be performed by&#xD;
           the patient's family doctor.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Graft versus host disease will be monitored clinically at each regular visit as well as&#xD;
           by measurement of liver function tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The donor will be included in the control program of stem cells donors and living kidney&#xD;
           donors as for regular transplant procedures (national registries for living kidney and&#xD;
           stem cell donors)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Chimerism level in peripheral blood will be regularly assessed&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Kidney allograft biopsies will be performed 6 months (before withdrawing of cyclosporine&#xD;
           A) and 1 year after transplantation&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Immune reconstitution will be analyzed by FACS of peripheral blood leukocytes and&#xD;
           additional functional assays in vitro.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Functional immunological tolerance will be measured in in vitro assays after 1, 2, 6,&#xD;
           12, 18 and 24 months. These additional tests are of scientific interest, but will not&#xD;
           influence clinical patient management.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Quality of life will be assessed as routinely performed in the context of the Swiss&#xD;
           transplant cohort study (www.stcs.ch)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Regular monitoring for cancer development as done after conventional transplantation&#xD;
           (skin cancer, breast cancer, prostate cancer).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Duration of subject participation and follow-up The active portion of this trial will begin&#xD;
      approximately 2 months prior to the transplantation and continue until 2 years&#xD;
      post-transplant. Study-related data will be collected for a minimum of 2 years&#xD;
      post-transplant. All subjects will be followed indefinitely for graft and patient survival in&#xD;
      routine clinical follow-ups.&#xD;
