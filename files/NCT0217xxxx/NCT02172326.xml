        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  All patients were required to have a diagnosis of COPD and to meet the following&#xD;
             spirometric criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Relatively stable, moderate to severe airway obstruction with an FEV1 ≤ 65% of&#xD;
                  predicted normal and FEV1/FVC ≤ 70%&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients were required to have normal renal clearance. Renal clearance will be&#xD;
             evaluated by the determination of creatinine clearance. To qualify for this trial, the&#xD;
             patient's measured creatinine clearance was required to be within 20% of the&#xD;
             calculated creatinine clearance, as given by the following equations:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Males: Calculated Creatinine Clearance (ml/min) = [140 - Age (yrs)] x weight(kg)&#xD;
                  / 72 x serum creatinine (mg/dL)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Females: Calculated Creatinine Clearance (ml/min) = [140 - Age (yrs)] x weight&#xD;
                  (kg) / 85 x serum creatinine (mg/dL)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Both male or female patients were eligible. Twelve patients ≥ 70 years old and twelve&#xD;
             patients ≤ 50 years&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients were required to have a smoking history of more than ten pack-years, where a&#xD;
             pack-year was defined as the equivalent of smoking one pack of cigarettes per day for&#xD;
             a year&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must be able to perform all specified procedures and maintain records during&#xD;
             the study period as required in the protocol&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients were required to be able to inhale medication from the HandiHaler®&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients were required to sign an Informed Consent Form prior to participation in the&#xD;
             trial, including any necessary prior to pre-study washout of their usual pulmonary&#xD;
             medications&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with significant diseases other than COPD were excluded from participation in&#xD;
             the trial. A significant disease was defined as a disease which in the opinion of the&#xD;
             investigator may either have put the patient at risk because of participation in the&#xD;
             trial or a disease which may have influenced the results of the trial or the patient's&#xD;
             ability to participate in the trial;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with clinically significant abnormal baseline haematology, blood chemistry or&#xD;
             urinalysis, if the abnormality defined a disease listed as an exclusion criterion;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with alanine transaminase (ALT/SGOT) &gt; 80 IU/L or aspartate transaminase&#xD;
             (AST/SGPT) &gt; 80 IU/L, or bilirubin &gt; 2.0 mg/dL or creatinine &gt; 2.0 mg/dL were excluded&#xD;
             from participation in the trial, regardless of the patient's clinical condition.&#xD;
             Repeat laboratory evaluations were not conducted in these patients;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with a recent history (i.e., one year or less) of myocardial infarction (MI);&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with a recent history (i.e., three years or less) of heart failure or&#xD;
             patients with any cardiac arrhythmia requiring drug therapy;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with regular use of daytime oxygen therapy;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with known active tuberculosis;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with a history of cancer within the last five years. However, patients with&#xD;
             treated basal cell carcinoma are allowed to participate;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with a history of life-threatening pulmonary obstruction, or a history of&#xD;
             cystic fibrosis or bronchiectasis;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who had undergone thoracotomy with pulmonary resection. Patients with a&#xD;
             history of a thoracotomy for other reasons were evaluated as per exclusion criterion #&#xD;
             1;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who had developed an upper respiratory tract infection in six weeks prior to&#xD;
             the Screening Visit (Visit 1) or during the baseline period;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with known hypersensitivity to anticholinergic drugs, lactose or any other&#xD;
             components of the inhalation capsule delivery system;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with known symptomatic prostatic hypertrophy or bladder neck obstruction;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with known narrow-angle glaucoma;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients treated with cromolyn sodium or nedocromil sodium;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients treated with antihistamines (H1 receptor antagonists);&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients using oral corticosteroid medication at unstable doses (i.e. less than six&#xD;
             weeks on a stable dose) or at a dose in excess of the equivalent of 10 mg of&#xD;
             prednisone per day (or 20 mg every other day);&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant or nursing women or women of childbearing potential not using a medically&#xD;
             approved means of contraception (i.e. oral contraceptives, intrauterine devices,&#xD;
             diaphragm or Norplant®);&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with a history of asthma, allergic rhinitis or atopy or patients with a total&#xD;
             blood eosinophil count ≥ 600/mm3. A repeat eosinophil count was not conducted in these&#xD;
             patients;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with history and/or active alcohol or drug abuse.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who had taken an investigational drug within one month or six half lives&#xD;
             (whichever was greater) prior to Screening Visit (Visit 1).&#xD;
