    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate cost-utility analysis in order to provide&#xD;
      recommendations to French decision-makers between vertebroplasty and radiation therapy in&#xD;
      Bone spine metastases. Indeed, radiation therapy is often advocated a systematic way. The&#xD;
      object of this study would be to expand the use of vertebroplasty.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Moreover, this study assess to the strategy impact on the pain control reduction and&#xD;
      functional preservation. In fact, analgesic effect is achieved differently depending on the&#xD;
      procedure used.Eligible patients will be recruited and registered consecutively. Patients&#xD;
      will be randomly,&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a health-economic multicenter, prospective, randomized with stratification according&#xD;
      to number of vertebrae to treat (1-3 vertebrae vs 4-6 vertebrae) and center :&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Arm A: Percutaneous vertebroplasty&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Arm B: External radiotherapy&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an open-label study. The expected total study period is 2.5 years (enrolment: 2&#xD;
      years, patient follow-up: 6 months). A total number of 304 patients with spine metastases&#xD;
      will be recruited (152 patients/arm).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Bone is the most common site for metastasis. In breast and prostate cancers, 70% of patients&#xD;
      dying of their cancer have evidence of metastatic bone disease [Coleman, 2006]. Depending on&#xD;
      their localization, bone metastases can have debilitating consequences resulting in&#xD;
      considerable morbidity and complex demands on health care resources. Bone spine metastases&#xD;
      are the most frequent site observed in patients with cancer of the lung, prostate, breast and&#xD;
      hemopoetic organs. The occurrence of spinal metastases in patients with advanced cancer can&#xD;
      cause significant morbidity, with pain and/or neurological deficit adversely affecting the&#xD;
      patients' quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interventional radiology takes a large place in the treatment of bone metastases. Currently,&#xD;
      vertebroplasty appears as the most satisfactory technique for stabilization of spine&#xD;
      metastases offering a significant improvement of the quality of life. The analgesic effect is&#xD;
      achieved very rapidly, i.e. usually within 24 hours post-procedure. Based on several&#xD;
      publications, around 90% of patients reported rapid pain relief following vertebroplasty with&#xD;
      60 to 70% of complete pain relief [Mendel, 2009].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Radiotherapy also plays a very important role in the palliative treatment of the metastatic&#xD;
      bone. Radiotherapy is effective and well tolerated. A reduction of the pain is noticed for 70&#xD;
      to 80 % of the patients and begins one or two weeks after the treatment. In all, the&#xD;
      radiotherapy increases the quality of life of the patients and can reduce the intake of&#xD;
      analgesics [Lutz, 2011].&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a lot of cases, vertebroplasty or radiotherapy can both be performed for a same painful&#xD;
      patient (the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) approved the use of&#xD;
      vertebroplasty for patients with spinal metastases in November 2008). Radiotherapy remains&#xD;
      the gold-standard treatment. However, vertebroplasty could be less costly and more effective&#xD;
      compare to radiotherapy. In fact, the superiority of vertebroplasty has been demonstrated at&#xD;
      least in the acute post-therapeutic period with (i) more rapid autonomy recovery, (ii)&#xD;
      reduction of antalgic intakes, and potentially less side-effects.&#xD;
