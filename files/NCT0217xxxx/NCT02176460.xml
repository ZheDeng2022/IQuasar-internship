  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Uric acid may be involved in the activation of the innate immune response in osteoarthritis&#xD;
      (OA) pathology and progression. This suggests that traditional gout therapy may be beneficial&#xD;
      for OA. Our goal therefore is to assess colchicine, an existing commercially available agent&#xD;
      for gout, for a new therapeutic indication-knee OA. The investigators propose a randomized&#xD;
      clinical trial (RCT) of 16 weeks' therapy with standard daily dose oral colchicine or placebo&#xD;
      for knee OA. The investigators hypothesize that colchicine will block inflammasome mediated&#xD;
      inflammation, thereby improve the signs and symptoms of OA, and reduce synovial fluid, serum&#xD;
      and urine inflammatory and biochemical joint degradation biomarkers. This trial will&#xD;
      potentially provide data to support a new treatment option for knee OA.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In a knee OA cohort with no clinical evidence or self-report of gout, The investigators&#xD;
      recently found a significant correlation of synovial fluid uric acid with radiographic and&#xD;
      scintigraphic measures of OA severity [1]. The investigators also observed strong&#xD;
      correlations of OA severity (radiographically and scintigraphically determined) and synovial&#xD;
      fluid uric acid with synovial fluid Interleukin (IL)-18 and IL-1β; these two cytokines are&#xD;
      classically produced during gout attacks by innate immune system activation mediated by uric&#xD;
      acid crystal-induced inflammasome assembly in macrophages. These results strongly support the&#xD;
      involvement of uric acid and the innate immune system in OA pathology and progression.&#xD;
      Whereas in gout flares, uric acid in a crystal form is what triggers the innate immune&#xD;
      response, we suspect that in OA, uric acid in a microcrystalline or particulate form is the&#xD;
      pathogenic agent -- able to trigger an innate immune response; this leads to release of&#xD;
      inflammatory cytokines like IL-18, IL-1β and subsequently tumor necrosis factor - α which&#xD;
      perpetuates further cartilage degradation. This new conception of the pathogenesis of OA has&#xD;
      very important treatment implications; it suggests that existing therapies for gout may be of&#xD;
      benefit in OA. Colchicine may be an effective treatment for OA due to its capacity in&#xD;
      suppressing the innate immune response at various levels. At micromolar concentrations&#xD;
      colchicine suppresses activation of the crystal-induced (NACHT), (LRR) and (PYD) domains&#xD;
      containing protein-3 (NALP3) inflammasome; IL-1β processing and release; and L-selectin&#xD;
      expression on neutrophils [2]. At nanomolar concentrations colchicine has blocks the release&#xD;
      of a crystal-derived chemotactic factor from neutrophil lysosomes; it blocks neutrophil&#xD;
      adhesion to endothelium by modulating the distribution of adhesion molecules on the&#xD;
      endothelial cells; and it inhibits urate crystal-induced production of superoxide anions from&#xD;
      neutrophils and macrophages. The pain and symptom relieving effects of colchicine for knee OA&#xD;
      have been demonstrated in three small but well-performed human randomized controlled trials&#xD;
      [3-5]; however, the mechanism of action of colchicine in OA has never been evaluated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators therefore propose a RCT of colchicine to examine the effects on signs and&#xD;
      symptoms of knee OA and to evaluate the mechanism of action through analysis of synovial&#xD;
      fluid and systemic biomarker profiles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: The investigators hypothesize that colchicine will block inflammasome mediated&#xD;
      inflammation, thereby improve the signs and symptoms of OA, and reduce synovial fluid serum&#xD;
      and urine inflammatory and biochemical joint degradation biomarkers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1. To determine whether daily oral colchicine at standard clinical doses (0.5 mg two&#xD;
      times daily), compared to placebo, can decrease the pain of symptomatic OA knee and improve&#xD;
      function when used as adjunctive daily therapy in addition to background therapy with the&#xD;
      patient's current stable analgesic regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2. To evaluate the mechanism of action of colchicine for reducing knee OA signs and&#xD;
      symptoms through analyses of synovial fluid, serum, and urine biomarker profiles - these will&#xD;
      interrogate and characterize the state of activation of joint metabolism (joint degradation&#xD;
      and synthesis markers), inflammatory mediators, the innate immune system and the NALP3&#xD;
      inflammasome components specifically both before (at baseline) and after 16 weeks therapy (at&#xD;
      study end) with oral colchicine versus placebo treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This pilot phase II study uses a double-blinded, randomized, placebo, controlled design.&#xD;
      Patients with symptomatic and radiographic knee OA (n=120) will be randomized to colchicine&#xD;
      (SIN 12490P) 0.5 mg bid (n=60) or placebo (n=60) daily for 16 weeks. Patients will be&#xD;
      permitted to remain on their baseline adjunctive therapy, including non-steroidal&#xD;
      anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) without changes for the duration of the study. They will&#xD;
      also be allowed the use of paracetamol not more than 2 g/day as rescue analgesia and pill&#xD;
      counting at the end of the study will be conducted to determine the amount of rescue medicine&#xD;
      utilized over the course of the 16-week study.&#xD;
