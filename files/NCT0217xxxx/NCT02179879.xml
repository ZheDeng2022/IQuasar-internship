      Procedural skills play an important role in anaesthetic expertise. More focused training and&#xD;
      assessment of procedural skills will be needed in the future as training moves from an&#xD;
      apprenticeship based training system to competency based assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently various techniques exists to assess procedural skills of anaesthetist. For epidural&#xD;
      catheter placement, task specific check list, global rating scales and cumulative sum&#xD;
      techniques have been developed and validated. These techniques aim either for better&#xD;
      qualitative outcome sacrificing objectivity or rely on self-reporting. A decrease in&#xD;
      objectivity in turn hampers inter-rater reliability which is an essential component of a&#xD;
      valid assessment model. Checklists type assessments force the developer to comprehensively&#xD;
      characterize the procedure of interest and then validate the completed procedure&#xD;
      characterization. This approach has been quantitatively shown to have higher assessment&#xD;
      reliability levels compared to Likert-scale assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of the project is to develop and validate a comprehensive procedure&#xD;
      characterization for labor epidural catheter placement. Another objective is to compare this&#xD;
      new assessment tool with existing checklist and global rating scale for labor epidural to&#xD;
      establish concurrent validity.5 A well-developed objective, validated procedure&#xD;
      characterization serves as a master tool which has multiple applications. It helps to build a&#xD;
      training programme for the procedure, allows providing metrics based feedback to trainees&#xD;
      using simulator, helps to assess the performance of trainees and in future might be used as&#xD;
      benchmark to allow competency based progression in the training.&#xD;

      Study part 1 After ethics committee approval a group of experts (n = 3 ) in conventional&#xD;
      lumbar epidural catheter placement will be selected (an expert is defined as one who has&#xD;
      performed more than 500 labor epidurals in preceding 5 year period). During a number of&#xD;
      face-to-face meetings experts will identify, characterize and define the procedure. They will&#xD;
      analyze task and identify units of behavior to be measured which constitute in a step-wise&#xD;
      fashion how the procedure is optimally performed and deviations from optimal procedure&#xD;
      performance as described previously. After informed consent from the patient and the&#xD;
      anaesthetist performing the procedure, 2 video recordings of experts performing epidural and&#xD;
      2 video recordings of novices (defined as one who has done less than 50 epidurals) performing&#xD;
      epidural will be recorded for detailed review during metric development meetings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study part 2 The developed metrics will be subjected to assessments of construct validity (a&#xD;
      set of procedures for evaluating a testing instrument based on a degree to which the test&#xD;
      terms identify the quality, ability or trait it was designed to measure) and concurrent&#xD;
      validity (the evaluation in which the relationship between the test scores and the scores on&#xD;
      the another instrument purporting to measure the same construct are related). We will also&#xD;
      evaluated the inter-rater reliability of the metrics using i) proportion of agreement between&#xD;
      raters, ii) correlation strength (using Pearson's Correlation Coefficient) and iii)&#xD;
      Coefficient Alpha. After informed consent,10 experts (who are not a part of committee&#xD;
      developing the metrics) each performing one or more lumbar epidural catheter placements for&#xD;
      labor and 10 novices each performing one or more lumbar epidural catheter placements for&#xD;
      labor will be video recorded. Two experts will review the video recording and score the&#xD;
      performance based on checklist based system developed and compare with likert-scale&#xD;
      checklists/global rating scale system.&#xD;
