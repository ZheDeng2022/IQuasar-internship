      -  To determine the therapeutic window of BIBR 1048 in order to select doses for further&#xD;
           studies in the development plan.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Twice daily regimen will be tested for most dose levels and once daily administration&#xD;
           will also be evaluated when appropriate.&#xD;
