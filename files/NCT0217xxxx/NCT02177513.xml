      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Marijuana (cannabis) is an illegal drug. Researchers want to study people s reactions,&#xD;
      attention, and behavior after they take marijuana in different ways. They want to learn&#xD;
      better ways to detect drugs in a person s body They also want to know how long marijuana can&#xD;
      be found in blood, urine, saliva, and breath.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To learn how people respond to delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC, a marijuana component)&#xD;
      and how their bodies handle it after it is given in different ways.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Adults age 18 50 who use marijuana.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants are screened under another NIDA protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  This study involves up to 6 visits to NIDA.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  At the first visit, participants will practice the tasks and tests they will do at their&#xD;
           dosing sessions. They will learn how to give breath and saliva samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Dosing sessions 1 4 will last 3 5 days each. All participants will be admitted to a&#xD;
           research clinic the night before these sessions. Some participants can stay at the&#xD;
           clinic and some must go home between sessions.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  At each session, participants will eat a brownie with placebo or marijuana. Then they&#xD;
           will smoke a placebo or marijuana cigarette. Some will inhale placebo or marijuana after&#xD;
           it is vaporized.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Throughout the sessions:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will give urine, saliva, and breath samples. Their blood will be taken with&#xD;
           a tube in a vein and finger pricks. Their vital signs will be checked.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will answer questionnaires and take thinking tests. They will also take&#xD;
           tests that assess eye movement, balance, and time estimation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants may have a 5th dosing session. They will eat a marijuana brownie and have&#xD;
           the above tests and samples.&#xD;

      Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cannabinoids are most commonly administered via smoking. Oral consumption in medications,&#xD;
      teas, oils, or food also is widely utilized. Additionally, cannabis vaporization followed by&#xD;
      inhalation for medical and illicit administration is common. Differences in cannabis&#xD;
      pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics between these three administration routes and in&#xD;
      occasional and frequent cannabis smokers are not thoroughly characterized. This study&#xD;
      evaluates cannabis pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics in occasional and frequent smokers&#xD;
      after smoked, vaporized, and oral cannabis administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      &lt;TAB&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 80 healthy cannabis smokers, aged 18-50, without a history of adverse reactions to&#xD;
      cannabis will be recruited. For dosing sessions 1-4, ten occasional smokers (smoking&#xD;
      frequency greater than or equal to 2 times/month but &lt;3 times/week) and ten frequent smokers&#xD;
      (smoking frequency generally greater than or equal to 5times/week) are required. For the&#xD;
      optional 5th session, 8-20 participants (regardless of smoking history) are required.&#xD;
&#xD;
      &lt;TAB&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design&#xD;
&#xD;
      Occasional and frequent cannabis smokers are recruited to participate. Prior to dosing&#xD;
      sessions, there is a training visit for all study procedures. Sessions 1-4 are 3 and 4 days&#xD;
      each for occasional and frequent cannabis smokers, respectively, and the study design is&#xD;
      double blind, double dummy, randomized, crossover, and placebo-controlled. In each session,&#xD;
      participants will consume a placebo or active oral (baked in a brownie) cannabis (6.9%&#xD;
      9-tetrahydrocannabinol [THC]) dose followed by either placebo or active smoked or vaporized&#xD;
      cannabis. Only one active dose will be administered in each dosing session. Whole blood, oral&#xD;
      fluid, urine, dried blood spots, and breath are collected throughout all sessions. Due to the&#xD;
      large THC body burden stored in the tissues, we will collect biological specimens for a&#xD;
      longer period in frequent cannabis smokers than for occasional cannabis smokers. An optional&#xD;
      5th dosing session will be offered in which participants receive a single oral cannabis dose&#xD;
      for pharmacokinetic monitoring. The placebo cannabis plant material has a low THC&#xD;
      concentration. As we are expecting that the active brownie dose might result in low THC oral&#xD;
      fluid contamination, it is necessary to have an active brownie THC dose that is not followed&#xD;
      by placebo vaporizer or smoked cannabis. Occasional smokers may stay or be discharged between&#xD;
      sessions, including between the 4th and optional 5th dosing session, but dosing must not&#xD;
      exceed self-reported intake frequency. Frequent smokers must be discharged for at least 72 h&#xD;
      between dosing sessions 1-4, and must stay on the unit at the end of session 4 for session 5&#xD;
      if they choose to participate. The difference between requirements for occasional and&#xD;
      frequent smokers to participate in the optional 5th dose is due to the potential confound of&#xD;
      low THC concentrations in frequent smokers that might not permit the detection of low THC&#xD;
      concentrations after consumption of a low oral THC dose. Occasional cannabis smokers will&#xD;
      reside on the closed research unit for approximately 72 h for dosing sessions 1-4, and for&#xD;
      approximately 66 h for dosing session 5. Frequent cannabis smokers will reside on the closed&#xD;
      research unit for approximately 90 h for dosing sessions 1-3 (and 4 if not participating in&#xD;
      optional session 5). If a frequent smoker chooses to participate in dosing session 5, they&#xD;
      will remain on the unit for approximately 162 h for sessions 4 and 5. Participants will&#xD;
      complete a battery of subjective, objective, and neurocognitive tests before and after&#xD;
      dosing. Subjective effects are assessed with visual analog scales. Objective measurements&#xD;
      include physiological measurements, expired carbon monoxide, reddening of the conjunctivae&#xD;
      and tests measuring psychomotor skills and cognitive functions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      &lt;TAB&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome Parameters&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary outcome measures include subjective and objective assessments, performance on&#xD;
      neurocognitive tasks, and cannabinoid concentrations in whole blood, oral fluid, urine, dried&#xD;
      blood spots, and breath. Correlations between cannabinoid concentrations in whole blood,&#xD;
      dried blood spots, oral fluid, and breath will be investigated, the Oral Fluid Working Group&#xD;
      for the Partnership for Clean Competition oral fluid screening algorithm will be evaluated,&#xD;
      and the pharmacokinetic profiles of alternative cannabinoids will be characterized. Secondary&#xD;
      investigations include comparing cannabinoid stability in dried blood spots and whole blood,&#xD;
      evaluating the World Anti-Doping Agency urine 11-nor-9-carboxy-THC decision limit,&#xD;
      characterizing the performance of the Alere DDS2 on-site oral fluid screening device, and&#xD;
      evaluating effects of acute cannabis administration on leptin and other appetitive&#xD;
      peptides.&lt;TAB&gt;&#xD;
