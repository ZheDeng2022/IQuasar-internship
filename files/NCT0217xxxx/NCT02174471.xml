  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Aortic stenosis (AS) is the most common valvular heart condition in the United Kingdom and&#xD;
      the Western world. Surgery for severe AS prior to symptom onset is controversial.&#xD;
      Conventionally changes in valve area and gradient are used to time intervention but&#xD;
      myocardial changes may be more predictive of surgical need.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aims to elucidate the role of diffuse myocardial fibrosis as a prognostic marker,&#xD;
      implementing a novel, non-invasive MRI technique to measure it.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: The investigators will measure diffuse myocardial fibrosis in 150 patients with&#xD;
      severe narrowing of the aortic valve before and one year after valve replacement. Expected&#xD;
      outcomes: Diffuse myocardial fibrosis measured by MRI scanning will predict outcome after&#xD;
      surgery in aortic stenosis. Anticipated Health Benefits: Identify patients with higher post&#xD;
      operative morbidity and mortality, who may benefit from earlier valve replacement.&#xD;

      Surgery for severe aortic stenosis (AS) prior to symptom onset is controversial.&#xD;
      Conventionally changes in valve area and gradient are used to time intervention but&#xD;
      myocardial changes may be more predictive of surgical need. This study aims to elucidate the&#xD;
      role of diffuse myocardial fibrosis as a prognostic marker, implementing a novel,&#xD;
      non-invasive technique to measure it.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AS is the most common valvular heart condition in the United Kingdom and the Western world.&#xD;
      Its prevalence rises with age - about 3% aged over 75 have severe AS. During a period of&#xD;
      progressive valve narrowing, the left ventricle (LV) adapts to the increased pressure with&#xD;
      increasing concentric muscle hypertrophy. However, eventually this remodelling becomes&#xD;
      maladaptive and the LV less compliant, leading to symptoms (breathlessness, chest pain, and&#xD;
      loss of consciousness). This heralds a significant increase in morbidity and mortality.&#xD;
      Consequently aortic valve replacement (AVR) in symptomatic patients is a Class I indication.&#xD;
      In most asymptomatic patients however, prophylactic surgery is controversial: the risk of&#xD;
      surgery is thought to be greater than watchful waiting, although there is no randomised data&#xD;
      to support this approach. Conversely, diffuse myocardial fibrosis is thought to play a key&#xD;
      role in functional deterioration, symptom development and possibly outcome in AS.&#xD;
      Unfortunately, assessment of AS severity, including hemodynamic parameters such as peak&#xD;
      velocity and mean gradient, poorly predict symptom development and/or optimal timing of&#xD;
      surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A non-invasive technique to quantify diffuse myocardial fibrosis against the gold standard of&#xD;
      myocardial biopsy has been developed and validated in patients with AS: Cardiovascular&#xD;
      magnetic resonance (CMR) with T1 mapping uses the extracellular tracer gadolinium to measure&#xD;
      the extracellular volume (ECV), which closely reflects the degree of diffuse fibrosis. An&#xD;
      important observation in a previous cohort (Flett et al European Heart Journal Cardiovascular&#xD;
      Imaging 2012) was the fate of patients with severe fibrosis: they were more symptomatic at&#xD;
      baseline, improved the most post-operatively and yet carried a trend towards increased&#xD;
      mortality at six months. To unravel this, this study aims to track diffuse fibrosis in the&#xD;
      RELIEF-AS study with a larger cohort (n=150) and for longer (12 months) to understand how to&#xD;
      use diffuse fibrosis as a prognostic marker.&#xD;
