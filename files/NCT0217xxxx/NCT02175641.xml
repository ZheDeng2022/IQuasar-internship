    <textblock>
      This goal of this randomized controlled effectiveness trial is to compare the effectiveness&#xD;
      of a peer-led health lifestyle intervention (Peer GLB) versus usual care services in&#xD;
      supportive housing agencies in New York City and Philadelphia serving diverse clients with&#xD;
      serious mental illness who are overweight or obese. The intervention follows the Group&#xD;
      Lifestyle Balance curriculum derived from the Diabetes Prevention Program and that has been&#xD;
      shown to help people achieve clinically significant weight loss (equal to or greater than 5%&#xD;
      weight loss of initial weight). The intervention will be delivered by trained&#xD;
      peer-specialists employed at the supportive housing agencies and supervised by the study&#xD;
      team. Peer GLB is a 12-month group intervention that focuses helping people lose weight by&#xD;
      improving people's diet and increasing their physical activity and consists of weekly core&#xD;
      group sessions (3 mo.), bi-monthly transitional group sessions (3 mo.), and maintenance&#xD;
      monthly sessions (6 mo.).&#xD;
&#xD;
      We plan to enroll 300 clients with serious mental illness who are overweight/obese (BMI equal&#xD;
      to or greater than 25) from our two supportive housing agencies. Clients will be randomized&#xD;
      to either the Peer-led healthy lifestyle intervention or usual care conditions. The primary&#xD;
      outcome for this study is achieving clinically significant weight loss (equal to or greater&#xD;
      than 5% weight loss from baseline weight) at 12 and 18 months post randomization. The&#xD;
      secondary outcomes for this study include overall reductions in weight, waist circumference,&#xD;
      blood pressure, and improvements in physical activity, self-efficacy, recovery and&#xD;
      health-related quality of life. Repeated assessments will be at baseline, 6, 12 and 18 month&#xD;
      post randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Hypothesis: Peer GLB participants will have a higher proportion of persons achieving&#xD;
      clinically significant weight loss (equal to or greater than 5% weight loss) at 12 and 18&#xD;
      months than UC participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Hypothesis: At 6, 12, and 18 months post-randomization, there will be significant&#xD;
      reductions in average weight, waist circumference, blood pressure, and significant&#xD;
      improvements in physical activity, self-efficacy, recovery, and health-related quality of&#xD;
      life in Peer GLB compared to UC.&#xD;
