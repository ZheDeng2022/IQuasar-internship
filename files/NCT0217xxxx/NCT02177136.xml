  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This was a phase 2, double-blind (DB), placebo-controlled trial in participants with primary&#xD;
      sclerosing cholangitis to evaluate the effect of obeticholic acid on liver biochemistry, in&#xD;
      particular, serum alkaline phosphatase; and, safety. The long-term safety extension (LTSE)&#xD;
      phase was conducted to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of long-term,&#xD;
      open-label use of OCA in participants with PSC who had completed the DB phase of the study.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This was a phase 2, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-finding evaluation of&#xD;
      the efficacy and safety of OCA in participants with PSC. Approximately 75 participants who&#xD;
      provided written informed consent and met all of the inclusion and none of the exclusion&#xD;
      criteria were randomized to 1 of 3 treatment groups as follows: 1.5 milligrams (mg) titrating&#xD;
      to 3 mg OCA, 5 mg titrating to 10 mg OCA, or placebo, in a 1:1:1 ratio. Participants&#xD;
      self-administered investigational product (IP) orally, once daily for 2 consecutive 12-week&#xD;
      periods.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the first 12 weeks, the participant's dose was 1.5 mg OCA, 5 mg OCA, or placebo. After 12&#xD;
      weeks, the participant's dose was titrated as follows, providing there were no limiting&#xD;
      safety or tolerability concerns in the opinion of the Investigator, while maintaining the&#xD;
      trial blind: the 1.5 mg OCA treatment group titrated to 3 mg, the 5 mg OCA treatment group&#xD;
      titrated to 10 mg OCA, and the placebo group remained on placebo. Double-blind treatment&#xD;
      continued for a further 12 weeks at that dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Any participant whose dose was not titrated, due to safety or tolerability concerns, remained&#xD;
      on their starting treatment (1.5 mg OCA, 5 mg OCA, or placebo) for the remainder of the DB&#xD;
      phase to Week 24.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization was stratified by the presence or absence of concomitant ursodeoxycholic acid&#xD;
      (UDCA) use and total bilirubin level (≤1.5x upper limit of normal [ULN] or &gt;1.5x ULN but&#xD;
      &lt;2.5x ULN).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following completion of the DB phase, participants were asked to reconfirm their consent for&#xD;
      participation in the open-label LTSE phase (planned as a further 24 months).&#xD;

    <description>The primary efficacy analysis compared the Week 24 change from Baseline in ALP between OCA treatment group and placebo using an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model with fixed effects for treatment group and randomization strata, and Baseline as a covariate.

    <measure>LTSE Phase: Incidence Of Adverse Events Of Special Interest (AESIs)</measure>
    <time_frame>LTSE Baseline (DB Week 24) to Month 26</time_frame>
    <description>The primary safety analysis evaluated the effects of OCA treatment on AESIs of pruritus, hepatic disorders, and dyslipidemia. All adverse event (AE) summaries were restricted to treatment emergent AEs (TEAEs), which were defined as any AEs that newly appeared, increased in frequency, or worsened in severity following initiation of investigational product. Treatment-emergent pruritus was defined as any preferred term (PT) including &quot;Prur-&quot;. Hepatic disorder AESIs were defined using specific Hepatic Disorders Standardized Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) Query (SMQ) terms. AE lipid profile changes, defined in the Dyslipidemia SMQ, were reported. Verbatim terms were mapped to PTs and system organ classes (SOCs) using MedDRA version 17.1 for all AE summaries except those for hepatic disorder AESIs, which used MedDRA version 18.1. A summary of serious and all other non-serious AEs, regardless of causality, is located in the Reported Adverse Events module.</description>

      <recruitment_details>Recruitment started December 2014 and completed September 2016. All participants were required to undergo thorough screening procedures, to confirm they met the eligibility criteria, during the 30-day period preceding the first dose.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>Double-blind (DB) Phase: 77 participants were randomly allocated to treatment with placebo, 1.5 milligrams (mg) obeticholic acid (OCA) titrated to 3 mg OCA, or 5 mg OCA titrated to 10 mg OCA; however, 1 participant did not receive treatment. Long-term Safety Extension (LTSE): Open-label OCA doses up to 10 mg daily were evaluated.</pre_assignment_details>

        <title>LTSE Phase: Incidence Of Adverse Events Of Special Interest (AESIs)</title>
        <description>The primary safety analysis evaluated the effects of OCA treatment on AESIs of pruritus, hepatic disorders, and dyslipidemia. All adverse event (AE) summaries were restricted to treatment emergent AEs (TEAEs), which were defined as any AEs that newly appeared, increased in frequency, or worsened in severity following initiation of investigational product. Treatment-emergent pruritus was defined as any preferred term (PT) including &quot;Prur-&quot;. Hepatic disorder AESIs were defined using specific Hepatic Disorders Standardized Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) Query (SMQ) terms. AE lipid profile changes, defined in the Dyslipidemia SMQ, were reported. Verbatim terms were mapped to PTs and system organ classes (SOCs) using MedDRA version 17.1 for all AE summaries except those for hepatic disorder AESIs, which used MedDRA version 18.1. A summary of serious and all other non-serious AEs, regardless of causality, is located in the Reported Adverse Events module.</description>

The ELF score and its components (hyaluronic acid [HA]; procollagen-3 N-terminal peptide [P3NP]; tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase 1 [TIMP-1]) was calculated as follows: 2.278 + 0.851 x ln(HA (ng/mL)) + 0.751 x ln(P3NP (ng/mL)) + 0.394 x ln(TIMP-1 (ng/mL). The DB value at Week 24 was used as the Baseline. An increase in score indicates an improvement/worsening of symptoms.</description>

        <title>LTSE Phase: Change From Baseline In Pruritus Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) At Month 12</title>
        <description>To assess the effects on disease-specific symptoms, the median change in the pruritus VAS score from Baseline at Month 12 is reported. The score is derived from the VAS participant questionnaire, which has the participant draw a line anywhere on a scale that best represents the severity of the itch; the scale ranges from 0 (no itching) to 10 (worst possible itching), in increments of 2. An increase in score represents an increase in severity of symptoms. The DB value at Week 24 was used as the Baseline.</description>

      <desc>Adverse events reporting is based on the safety population, where the treatment group was defined by the treatment actually received. One (1) placebo participant actually received 5 mg OCA titrating to 10 mg OCA. All adverse event summaries are based on treatment-emergent adverse events. Verbatim terms were mapped to PTs and SOCs using MedDRA version 17.1 for all AE summaries except those for hepatic disorder AESIs, which used MedDRA version 18.1.</desc>
