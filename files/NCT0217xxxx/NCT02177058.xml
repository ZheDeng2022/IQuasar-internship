      This project directly addresses the national imperative for innovative strategies to improve&#xD;
      care for Medicare beneficiaries and reduce health care costs. The overall objective of the&#xD;
      proposed project is to improve the care of older individuals who reside in nursing homes&#xD;
      (NHs), and at the same time reduce unnecessary Medicare expenditures. This goal will be&#xD;
      accomplished by testing a quality improvement program designed to reduce the number of&#xD;
      avoidable hospitalizations of NH residents in a randomized controlled trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary hypotheses to be tested are:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis1: Interventions to Reduce Acute Care Transfers (INTERACT) implementation NHs will&#xD;
      have a greater reduction in hospitalization rate than the control and monitoring only NHs&#xD;
      during the 12-month implementation compared to a 12-month baseline period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 2: Reductions in Medicare expenditures for hospitalizations in the INTERACT&#xD;
      implementation NHs will be greater than the estimated costs of implementing the intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 3: The effects of INTERACT on hospitalization rates will be greater among patients&#xD;
      on the Medicare skilled benefit for post-acute care, than for long-stay patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 4: The effects of INTERACT on hospitalization rates will be greatest among those&#xD;
      NHs with higher vs. lower intensity (fidelity) of implementing the program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 5: There will be a greater reduction in measures of hospitalizations for&#xD;
      conditions defined as &quot;potentially preventable&quot; than for other transfers and&#xD;
      hospitalizations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 6: Implementation of INTERACT will not be associated with worsening of relevant&#xD;
      quality measures in the participating NHs.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hospitalizations of Nursing Home (NH) residents are frequent and associated with numerous&#xD;
      complications and increased health care costs. Previous research suggests that as many as&#xD;
      two-thirds of such hospitalizations may be avoidable. Anticipated changes in Medicare&#xD;
      reimbursement will reduce financial incentives that favor hospitalization, but could result&#xD;
      in reduced care quality if NH staff does not have the training and clinical tools to manage&#xD;
      residents in the NH when acute changes occur. INTERACT (Interventions to Reduce Acute Care&#xD;
      Transfers) is a quality improvement program that utilizes tools based on established clinical&#xD;
      guidelines. The tools target three key strategies to reduce potentially avoidable&#xD;
      hospitalizations: 1) preventing conditions from becoming severe enough to require acute&#xD;
      hospital care; 2) managing selected acute conditions in the NH; and 3) improving advance care&#xD;
      planning for residents among whom a palliative or comfort care plan, rather than acute&#xD;
      hospitalization, may be appropriate. Preliminary research involving 30 NHs demonstrated a 17%&#xD;
      reduction in hospitalizations compared to the same six-month period in the previous year. The&#xD;
      cost of the intervention was $7,700; projected savings to Medicare of reduced hospital&#xD;
      admissions from a 100-bed NH were $125,000/year. While these results are promising, the&#xD;
      effectiveness of INTERACT in reducing hospitalizations remains to be tested in a controlled&#xD;
      trial. The proposed project will therefore involve an interdisciplinary team of experienced&#xD;
      NH researchers in conducting a randomized controlled trial to test the implementation of the&#xD;
      INTERACT program. NHs randomized to the INTERACT intervention will participate in 3-months of&#xD;
      training, and receive support during the 12-month implementation period by an experienced&#xD;
      nurse practitioner through regular multi-NH conference calls, monthly individual calls, and&#xD;
      as-needed telephonic or email communication. The effects of implementing the INTERACT&#xD;
      intervention on hospitalization rates will be compared to a randomly assigned group of usual&#xD;
      care control NHs and a group that will self-monitor hospitalization rates only. The&#xD;
      hypotheses to be tested are:&#xD;
&#xD;
      1) INTERACT implementation NHs will have a greater reduction in hospitalization rates than&#xD;
      the control and monitoring only NHs during the 12-month implementation compared to a 12-month&#xD;
      baseline period; and 2) reductions in Medicare expenditures for hospitalizations in the&#xD;
      INTERACT intervention NHs will exceed the estimated costs of implementing the intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The specific aims of this project are to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Determine the effectiveness of implementing the INTERACT quality improvement program in&#xD;
           reducing hospitalization rates.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Calculate the differences in Medicare expenditures for hospitalizations between NHs&#xD;
           implementing INTERACT, the usual care control group, and NHs in the monitoring&#xD;
           hospitalization rates only group.&#xD;
