  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study was to compare the long-term (12-week) bronchodilator&#xD;
      efficacy and safety of ipratropium bromide / salbutamol combination administered by the&#xD;
      Respimat® 40 mcg / 200 mcg (one inhalation q.i.d.) to COMBIVENT Inhalation Aerosol (two&#xD;
      inhalations q.i.d.), ipratropium bromide Respimat® (one inhalation q.i.d.) and Placebo&#xD;
      formulations of each in patients with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD). An&#xD;
      additional objective was to show the superiority of Combivent Respimat as compared to&#xD;
      ipratropium bromide (40 mcg) Respimat. Steady state pharmacokinetics over one dosing interval&#xD;
      following four weeks of therapy were also characterized.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  All patients must have a diagnosis of COPD and the following spirometric criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Visit 1 (Screening) and Visit 2: Patients must have relatively stable, moderate&#xD;
                  to severe airway obstruction with an FEV1 ≤65% of predicted normal and FEV1 ≤70%&#xD;
                  of FVC&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Male or female patients 40 years of age or older&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have a smoking history of more than ten pack-years. A pack-year is&#xD;
             defined as the equivalent of smoking one pack of 20 cigarettes per day for a year&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must be able to perform pulmonary function tests and maintain records during&#xD;
             the study period as required in the protocol&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with significant diseases other than COPD will be excluded. A significant&#xD;
             disease is defined as a disease which in the opinion of the investigator may either&#xD;
             put the patient at risk because of participation in the study or a disease which may&#xD;
             influence the results of the study or the patient's ability to participate in the&#xD;
             study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with clinically relevant abnormal baseline hematology, blood chemistry or&#xD;
             urinalysis. If the abnormality defines a disease listed as an exclusion criterion, the&#xD;
             patient is excluded&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  All patients with a SGOT (serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase) &gt;80 IU/L, SGPT&#xD;
             (serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase) &gt;80 IU/L, bilirubin &gt;2.0 mg/dL or creatinine&#xD;
             &gt;2.0 mg/dL will be excluded regardless of the clinical condition&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have a total blood eosinophil count ≥600/mm3&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with a recent history (i.e., one year or less) of myocardial infarction&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Patients with a history of cancer, other than treated basal cell carcinoma, within the&#xD;
             last 5 years&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with a history of life-threatening pulmonary obstruction, or a history of&#xD;
             cystic fibrosis or clinically evident bronchiectasis&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have undergone thoracotomy with pulmonary resection. Patients with a&#xD;
             history of a thoracotomy for other reasons should be evaluated as per exclusion&#xD;
             criterion No. 1&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with a history of asthma or allergic rhinitis&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with a history of and/or active alcohol or drug abuse&#xD;

             in the investigator's opinion will be unable to abstain from the use of oxygen therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who are being treated with cromolyn sodium or nedocromil sodium&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who are being treated with antihistamines for any excluded allergic&#xD;

          -  Patients using oral corticosteroid medication at unstable doses (i.e., less than 6&#xD;
             weeks on a stable dose) or at a dose in excess of the equivalent of 10 mg of&#xD;
             prednisone per day or 20 mg every other day&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who initiated use of an inhaled steroid or changed doses less than 6 weeks&#xD;

             ipratropium bromide/salbutamol Respimat® solution (including BAC (Benzalkonium&#xD;
             chloride) and EDTA (Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid)) or the ipratropium&#xD;
