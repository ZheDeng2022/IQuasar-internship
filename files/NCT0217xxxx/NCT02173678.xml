             intrauterine devices; sterilised) and must have a negative urine pregnancy test&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  All subjects must have a negative hepatitis B, C and HIV tests as well as a negative&#xD;
             drug screening&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prior to admission to the treatment after giving his/her informed consent (in&#xD;

             examination (incl. blood pressure and pulse rate measurements) as well as 12-lead ECG&#xD;
             within 14 days before the first administration of the test drug. Haematopoietic,&#xD;
             hepatic and renal function tests will be carried out in the laboratory. The subject&#xD;
