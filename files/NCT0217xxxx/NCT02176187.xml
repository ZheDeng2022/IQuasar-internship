    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  All patients must have a diagnosis of COPD and must meet the following spirometric&#xD;
             criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Patients must have relatively stable, mild to severe airway obstruction with an&#xD;
                  forced expiratory volulme in one second (FEV1) ≤70% of predicted normal and FEV1&#xD;
                  ≤70% of forced vital capacity (FVC). Predicted normal values calculated according&#xD;
                  to evolutionary conserved chromosome segments (ECCS)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Patients who have frequent exacerbations which could be expected to interfere&#xD;
                  with the patient's ability to participate in the study should be excluded&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Male or non-pregnant/non-lactating female patients aged ≥18 years&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must demonstrate poor MDI technique prior to the start of the study. Presence&#xD;
             of any of the following will be considered poor technique:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Failure to co-ordinate &quot;firing&quot; of an MDI with inhalation&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Too fast an inhalation rate (&gt; 30 litres/minute (L/min))&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Presence of &quot;Cold Freon&quot; effect (MDI spray hitting the back of the throat that&#xD;
                  caused the patient to stop inhaling)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  All patients must sign an informed consent form prior to participation in the study,&#xD;
             i.e. prior to pre-study washout of their usual pulmonary medications&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Current or ex-smokers with a smoking history of &gt;10 pack years&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with significant diseases other than COPD will be excluded. A significant&#xD;
             disease is defined as a disease which in the opinion of the investigator may either&#xD;
             put the patient at risk because of participation in the study or a disease which may&#xD;
             influence the results of the study or the patient's ability to participate in the&#xD;
             study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with clinically relevant abnormal baseline haematology, blood chemistry or&#xD;
             urinalysis, if the abnormality defines a disease listed as an exclusion criterion will&#xD;
             be excluded&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with a recent history (i.e. six months or less) of myocardial infarction&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with any unstable or life-threatening cardiac arrhythmia or who have been&#xD;
             hospitalised for heart failure within the past year&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who regularly use daytime oxygen therapy for more than 1 hour per day and in&#xD;
             the investigator's opinion will be unable to abstain from the use of oxygen&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with known active tuberculosis&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with a history of cancer within the last five years. Patients with treated&#xD;
             basal cell carcinoma are allowed&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with a history of life-threatening pulmonary obstruction, or a history of&#xD;
             cystic fibrosis or bronchiectasis&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have undergone thoracotomy with pulmonary resection. Patients with a&#xD;
             history of thoracotomy for other reasons should be evaluated as per exclusion 1&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with any upper respiratory infection in the past 14 days prior to the&#xD;
             screening visit or during the baseline period&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who are currently in a pulmonary rehabilitation programme or who have&#xD;
             completed a pulmonary rehabilitation programme in the six weeks prior to the screening&#xD;
             visit&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with known hypersensitivity to β2-agonists, anticholinergic drugs or any&#xD;
             excipients of the active or placebo Berodual®&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with known narrow-angle glaucoma&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who are being treated with antihistamines (H1 receptor antagonists)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients using oral corticosteroid medication at unstable doses (i.e. less than six&#xD;
             weeks on a stable dose) or at doses in excess of the equivalent of 10 mg of&#xD;
             prednisolone per day or 20 mg every other day&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who are being treated with monamine oxidase inhibitors or tricyclic&#xD;
             antidepressants&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant or nursing women or women of childbearing potential not using a medically&#xD;
             approved means of contraception (i.e. oral or injectable eg Depo-Provera or Noristerat&#xD;
             contraceptives, intrauterine devices, diaphragm (plus spermicide) or subdermal&#xD;
             implants eg: Norplant®)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with, in the opinion of the investigator, a history of and/or active&#xD;
             significant alcohol or drug abuse&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have taken an investigational drug within four months or six half lives&#xD;
             (whichever is the greater) prior to screening visit and/or the administration of&#xD;
             radiolabelled dosage forms within the three months prior to the screening visit&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Radiation exposure from clinical studies, including that from the present study and&#xD;
             diagnostic X-rays but excluding background radiation, exceeding 5 millisievert (mSv)&#xD;
             in the last 12 months or 10 mSv in the last five years. No patient whose occupational&#xD;
             exposure is monitored will participate in the study&#xD;
&#xD;
        Precautions: As with other anticholinergic drugs, Berodual® should be used with caution in&#xD;
        patients with prostatic hyperplasia or bladder neck obstruction.&#xD;
