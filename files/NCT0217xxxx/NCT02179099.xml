  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single arm pilot study evaluating the feasibility and preliminary safety of a&#xD;
      single intravesical instillation of TC-3 gel mixed with botulinum toxin (BTX) for symptomatic&#xD;
      improvement in overactive bladder patients.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      BTX is considered as therapeutic option for overactive bladder (OAB). Randomized&#xD;
      placebo-controlled studies have shown that BTX administered by intramural injection into the&#xD;
      bladder wall in patients with OAB leads to significant improvement in urodynamic parameters&#xD;
      and quality of life. (Schurch 2008). On the other hand, the animal study suggests that&#xD;
      intravesically applied BTX acts to decrease frequency of bladder contraction by inhibiting&#xD;
      sensory mechanism in the urothelium rather than directly through inhibition of the smooth&#xD;
      muscle contraction. (Khera 2005). The efficacy of intravesical BTX instillation was only&#xD;
      tested in a few open label trials for overactive bladder patients whereby the clinical&#xD;
      improvement observed was short-lasting with a mean duration of 6.8 weeks (Petrou 2009, Krhut&#xD;
      2011). The short exposure duration of the urothelium to BTX could be one of the factors&#xD;
      responsible for the lack of a sustained effect. TC-3 is a hydrogel with reverse thermal&#xD;
      gelation properties that when mixed with BTX and instilled intravesically serves as the drug&#xD;
      reservoir allowing for gradual release of BTX and thereby for its extended contact with&#xD;
      bladder urothelium.&#xD;

          -  Female 18 to 85 years old with symptoms of idiopathic OAB for ≥ 3 months prior to&#xD;
             screening.&#xD;
