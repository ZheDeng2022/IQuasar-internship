    <textblock>
      As there are no validated tools for assessing patient reported outcomes or health related&#xD;
      quality of life in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), different studies have utilised&#xD;
      different methods. This means that comparison of the outcomes of studies is difficult or&#xD;
      inaccurate. By collecting different quality of life tools and patient reported outcome at the&#xD;
      same time, it will be possible to map or model the results of one tool or groups of tools&#xD;
      onto another. 250 patients with IPF will be asked to complete the EuroQoL 5D, Kings Brief&#xD;
      Interstitial Lung Disease questionnaire, St George's Respiratory Questionnaire, MRC dyspnoea&#xD;
      scale, University of California, San Diego shortness of breath questionnaire and the Hospital&#xD;
      Anxiety and Depression Scale, along with spirometry every 3 months, and undergo a 6 minute&#xD;
      walk test every 6 months, over a 12 month period. Prognostic models will be constructed from&#xD;
      all the clinical (questionnaire and function) measures a linear regression model.&#xD;

      There are no validated or accepted tools for assessing health related quality of life (HRQOL)&#xD;
      or dyspnoea in patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) and there are no accepted or&#xD;
      recommended tools for assessing patient reported outcomes in clinical trials of patients with&#xD;
      IPF. Assessment of these outcomes is important to patients and may be considered the most&#xD;
      crucial outcome measures of an intervention in IPF. With this in mind, the majority of the&#xD;
      recently reported randomised clinical studies in IPF have evaluated HRQOL and dyspnoea, most&#xD;
      commonly as secondary outcomes, but this has been achieved by different tools. For example&#xD;
      the Capacity studies(1) utilised the St George's Respiratory Questionnaire whereas the ASCEND&#xD;
      (Efficacy and Safety of Pirfenidone in Patients With Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis)&#xD;
      (http://clinicaltrial.gov/ct2/show/NCT01366209) study is currently assessing dyspnoea using&#xD;
      the University of California, San Diego shortness of breath questionnaire. As there is no&#xD;
      method of directly comparing HRQOL between different clinical evaluations in IPF, there is a&#xD;
      desperate need to produce algorithms for relating the different outcome measures in IPF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The St George's Respiratory Questionnaire(2) is the most commonly utilised tool in trials of&#xD;
      IPF(3-5). Although it relates to physiological impairment in IPF(6), it was developed in&#xD;
      patients with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) and therefore lacks content&#xD;
      validity. An abbreviated version (SGRQ-I) containing the questions most relevant to IPF has&#xD;
      therefore been developed and validated(7). The Kings Brief Interstitial Lung disease (K-BILD)&#xD;
      questionnaire is a recently validated tool for patients with interstitial lung disease not&#xD;
      specifically idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis(8) but has not been utilised in multicentre&#xD;
      studies to measure treatment interventions in IPF. The EuroQol 5D (EQ5D) is a well-validated&#xD;
      global health status instrument designed for use in clinical and health-economic trials(9).&#xD;
      This has been validated in chronic respiratory disease and has been used in several&#xD;
      studies(4, 5, 10). In terms of assessing dyspnoea, studies have utilised the University of&#xD;
      California, San Diego (UCSD) shortness of breath questionnaire (SOBQ)(4, 11), the medicine&#xD;
      research council (MRC) dyspnoea score(5), and the transition dyspnoea index(12).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators have conducted a brief mapping exercise based on the data from patients&#xD;
      randomised to the placebo arm of the Treating idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis with the addition&#xD;
      of co-trimoxazole (TIPAC) study(5). The SGRQ data were mapped onto the EQ5D data using pairs&#xD;
      of data from individuals at the same time point with the addition demographic and lung&#xD;
      function data(unpublished). This mapping exercise produced an equation with greater&#xD;
      predictive strength than using data from COPD patients showing that modelling algorithms are&#xD;
      disease specific information cannot be shared between different respiratory conditions. The&#xD;
      investigators now wish to undertake a larger study to generate more accurate models to&#xD;
      approximate the EQ5D and also to explore the relationship between other patient reported&#xD;
      outcome measures. It is only by undertaking this work, that the results of individual studies&#xD;
      can be compared.&#xD;
