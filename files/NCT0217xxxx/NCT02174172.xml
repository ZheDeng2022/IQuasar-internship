  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This global, multicenter, open-label study will evaluate the safety and tolerability of&#xD;
      atezolizumab in combination with other immune-modulating therapies in the treatment of&#xD;
      selected advanced or metastatic malignancies. The atezolizumab plus ipilimumab arm (Arm A)&#xD;
      will focus primarily on participants with advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer&#xD;
      (NSCLC). The atezolizumab plus interferon alfa-2b arm (Arm B), plus pegylated interferon&#xD;
      alfa-2a (PEG-interferon alfa-2a, Arm C), and atezolizumab plus PEG-interferon Alfa-2a plus&#xD;
      bevacizumab (Arm D) will enroll participants with advanced or metastatic renal cell carcinoma&#xD;
      (RCC), metastatic NSCLC and melanoma. The atezolizumab plus obinutuzumab) (Arm E) will enroll&#xD;
      participants with recurrent and/or metastatic (R/M) head and neck squamous cell carcinoma&#xD;
      (HNSCC). Atezolizumab will be administered as intravenous (IV) infusion every 3 weeks (q3w).&#xD;
