  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Previous research has demonstrated that investigators can coat (arm) T cells with a special&#xD;
      molecule called GD2 bispecific antibody that will help T cells recognize neuroblastoma and&#xD;
      osteosarcoma cells and kill them. This bispecific antibody recognizes GD2, a protein found on&#xD;
      almost all neuroblastoma and osteosarcoma cells. The investigators put the GD2 bispecific&#xD;
      antibody on T cells and give large numbers of these T cells back to patients. The&#xD;
      investigators think that these T cells may have a better chance of killing GD2 expressing&#xD;
      tumor cells when they are armed with GD2 bispecific antibody. This trial studies the side&#xD;
      effects and best dose of activated T cells armed with GD2 bispecific antibody and how well&#xD;
      they work in treating patients with neuroblastoma, osteosarcoma, and other GD2-positive solid&#xD;
      tumors.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To perform a phase I dose-escalation study in patients with recurrent or refractory&#xD;
      neuroblastoma (NB) and other GD2-positive tumors to evaluate the safety and tolerability and&#xD;
      to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) for anti-CD3 x hu3F8 bispecific antibody&#xD;
      (GD2Bi)-armed activated T cells (aATC) infused twice a week for a total of eight infusions in&#xD;
      combination with daily IL-2 (300,000 IU/m^2/day) and GM-CSF (250 ug/m^2 twice per week) in a&#xD;
      standard 3 + 3 dose escalation schema with 40, 80, and 160 x 10^6 cells/kg/infusion dose&#xD;
      levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To conduct a phase II clinical trial to explore efficacy and confirm the toxicity profile&#xD;
      of GD2Bi-aATC combined with IL-2 and GM-CSF in a phase II expansion cohort of 22 patients&#xD;
      with neuroblastoma (NB) using MTD determined in the phase I.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Evaluate immune responses in the phase I/II trial by sequential monitoring of anti-NB&#xD;
      cytotoxicity of peripheral blood lymphocytes and IFN-gamma EliSpots directed at NB lines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To evaluate persistence of aATC in the blood and tumor biopsies by staining for murine&#xD;
      IgG2a to confirm trafficking of armed T cells to tumor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To conduct exploratory study of (18F FDG) positron emission tomography (PET)/computed&#xD;
      tomography (CT) after armed ATC infusions in selected patients with PET/CT measurable soft&#xD;
      tissue and skeletal lesions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose-escalation study of OKT3/humanized 3F8 bispecific&#xD;
      antibody-aATC followed by a phase II study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive IL-2 subcutaneously (SC) daily on days -2 to 35, sargramostim SC twice&#xD;
      weekly for 4 weeks, and OKT3/humanized 3F8 bispecific antibody-aATC intravenously (IV) over&#xD;
      30 minutes twice weekly for 4 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months.&#xD;
