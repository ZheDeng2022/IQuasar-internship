        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. All patients had to sign an informed consent consistent with ICH-GCP guidelines prior&#xD;
             to participation in the trial, which includes medication washout and restrictions.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Male or female patients 40 years of age or older.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. All patients had to have a diagnosis of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and must&#xD;
             meet the following spirometric criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
             Patients had to have moderate to severe airway obstruction with a postbronchodilator&#xD;
             FEV1/FVC ≤ 70% and FEV1 ≤ 60% predicted (Visit 1).&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. FEV1 % predicted and/or forced vital capacity (FVC) increases &gt;5% after inhalation&#xD;
             with 480 μg salbutamol and 80 μg ipratropium&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Patients had to be current or ex-smokers with a smoking history of more than 10&#xD;
             pack-years.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Patients had to be able to perform technically acceptable pulmonary function tests and&#xD;
             had to be able to maintain records (Patient Daily Record) during the study period as&#xD;
             required in the protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Patients had to be able to inhale medication from the HandiHaler, and from an&#xD;
             inhalation aerosol.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Patients should have had a ventilatory limitation of maximal exercise capacity:&#xD;
&#xD;
             Increase in arterial carvon dioxide tension (PaCO2) during incremental bicycle test&#xD;
             and/or increase in minute ventilation (VE) max &gt; 80% (FEV1 x 37.5)&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Patients should have had a Wmax ≥ 40 Watt during maximal incremental bicycle test.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Increase of blood lactate &gt; 10 mmol/L at peak exercise&#xD;
&#xD;

          3. Decrease of oxygen saturation below 90% at ≥ 50% of Wmax&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Patients with significant diseases other than COPD had to be excluded. A significant&#xD;
             disease was defined as a disease which in the opinion of the investigator may either&#xD;
             put the patient at risk because of participation in the study or a disease which may&#xD;
             influence the results of the study or the patient's ability to participate in the&#xD;
             study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Patients with clinically relevant abnormal haemoglobulin, leukocytes, thrombocytes,&#xD;
             glucose, sodium, potassium.&#xD;

&#xD;
          7. Patients with any cardiac arrhythmia requiring drug therapy or who have been&#xD;
             hospitalised for heart failure within the past three years.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Patients with known active tuberculosis.&#xD;

&#xD;
         12. Patients with any respiratory infection in the six weeks prior to the Screening Visit&#xD;
             (Visit 1) or during the baseline period. The enrolment of these patients was to be&#xD;
             postponed for at least six weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. Patients who have frequent exacerbations (at least three in the preceding year) which&#xD;
             could be expected to interfere with the patient's ability to participate in the trial&#xD;

&#xD;
         20. Patients who were being treated with theophyllines&#xD;
&#xD;
         21. Patients who were currently on β-blocker therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;

             weeks on a stable dose) or at doses in excess of the equivalent of 10 mg of prednisone&#xD;
             per day or 20 mg every other day.&#xD;
&#xD;
         23. Pregnant or nursing women or women of childbearing potential not using a medically&#xD;
             approved means of contraception for the previous 3 months (i.e. oral contraceptives,&#xD;

&#xD;
         24. Patients with a history of asthma or allergic rhinitis or who have a total blood&#xD;
             eosinophil count ≥600 /mm3. A repeat eosinophil count was not conducted in these&#xD;
             patients (Criterion modified by Protocol Amendment 2).&#xD;
&#xD;
         25. Patients with significant alcohol or drug abuse within the past two years.&#xD;
