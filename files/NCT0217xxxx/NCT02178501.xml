  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The major source of mortality and morbidity of diabetic patients is cardiovascular disease&#xD;
      (CVD). Moreover, in CVD patients the presence of diabetes is associated with the increased&#xD;
      risk of major adverse cardiac events as compared to patients without diabetes. The&#xD;
      pathophysiology of macrovascular complications in T2D is not fully understood and involves:&#xD;
      1/ induction of oxidative stress, 2/ the formation of advanced glycation end products, 3/&#xD;
      activation of blood coagulation and platelet aggregation, 4/ increased inflammation, 5/&#xD;
      altered secretion of adipokines in obese subjects and 6/ endothelial dysfunction. All those&#xD;
      mechanisms in T2D patients could potentially be a subject of new therapeutic interventions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A therapy that continues to show promise in T2D patients with CVD is supplementation with&#xD;
      omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA). Clinical studies have indicated that omega-3 PUFA&#xD;
      decrease the risk of major cardiovascular events, although the mechanism of action is not&#xD;
      completely understood. Moreover, there were no trials exploring the mechanisms and outcomes&#xD;
      of omega-3 treatment in T2D patients with CVD. Despite that fact, Polish Diabetes Association&#xD;
      guidelines recommend the use of omega-3 PUFA in patients with diabetes in the prevention of&#xD;
      macrovascular complications. Moreover, it is unclear whether the benefits of modifying the&#xD;
      pathophysiological processes during supplementation with omega-3 PUFA occur only in patients&#xD;
      with their deficiency or in all patients with type 2 diabetes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Potential benefits of omega-3 PUFA in such patients are: 1/ decreased oxidative stress, 2/&#xD;
      decreased platelet aggregation and reduction of hypercoagulable state, 3/ anti-inflammatory&#xD;
      effects, 4/ improvement in endothelial function. All those effects were explored previously&#xD;
      with inconsistent findings. There is very limited information from clinical studies on the&#xD;
      mechanisms and benefits of omega-3 PUFA in T2D patients with CVD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of the current study is to evaluate the effects of omega-3 PUFA administered on&#xD;
      top of optimal therapy of atherosclerotic vascular disease and T2D on endothelial function,&#xD;
      platelet aggregation and thrombotic, inflammatory and oxidative stress biomarkers.&#xD;

      The study will provide insight into:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The influence of the baseline level of omega-3 PUFA in patients with type 2 diabetes&#xD;
           mellitus (T2D) and CVD on endothelial function, platelet aggregation and thrombotic,&#xD;
           inflammatory, oxidative stress biomarkers.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The potential to improve the endothelial function, reduce the oxidative stress and to&#xD;
           decrease the atherothrombotic and inflammatory biomarkers with the supplementation with&#xD;
           a moderate dose of omega-3 PUFA&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. The mechanisms of the clinically observed effects of omega-3 PUFA in T2D patients with&#xD;
           CVD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SCIENTIFIC BACKGROUND The incidence of diabetes is growing in the world and the number of&#xD;
      patients already exceeded 360 million and by 2030 this will rise to 552 million. The major&#xD;
      source of mortality and morbidity of diabetic patients is cardiovascular disease (CVD). On&#xD;
      average, it is estimated that people with type 2 diabetes (T2D) will die 5-10 years before&#xD;
      people without T2D, mostly due to CVD. The treatment of CVD accounts for a large part of the&#xD;
      huge healthcare costs attributable to T2D (10-12% of European health care expenditure).&#xD;
      Despite significant improvements in the treatment of CVD with antiplatelet agents, statin,&#xD;
      angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) and newer antidiabetic drugs the mortality of&#xD;
      diabetic patients with CVD is continuously significantly higher than in people without T2D.&#xD;
      This pattern of elevated cardiovascular risk in diabetes has been attributed to several&#xD;
      possible mediating factors, including the development of more extensive, multi-vessel&#xD;
      coronary artery disease, the presence of impaired myocardial systolic contractility, diffuse&#xD;
      small vessel endothelial dysfunction and the presence of a hypercoagulable or pro-thrombotic&#xD;
      state attributable to diabetes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The increased cardiovascular risk in T2D patients is generated by the metabolic disturbances&#xD;
      related to diabetes (both hyperglycaemia and hypoglycaemia) and that includes:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  irreversible glycation of intra- and extracellular proteins leading to changes in gene&#xD;
           expression and induction of oxidative stress leading to endothelial dysfunction,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  activation of protein kinase C resulting in activation of blood coagulation,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  increase in the levels of various pro-atherothrombotic and inflammatory biomarkers e.g.&#xD;
           markers of platelet activation, thrombin generation, endothelin, von Willebrand factor,&#xD;
           adhesion molecules (eg.VCAM-1, vascular endothelial cell adhesion molecule), growth&#xD;
           factors (VEGF), factor VII, CRP, IL-6 (interleukin-6). Moreover it was recently&#xD;
           described that hyperglycemia in T2D leads to nonenzymatic glycation of fibrinogen.&#xD;
           Glycated fibrinogen leads to denser fibrin clots that are stiffer and more resistant to&#xD;
           fibrinolysis, thus leading to an increased thrombotic burden,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  altered secretion of adipokines by adipose tissue in obese subjects with T2D. It was&#xD;
           demonstrated that greater adiposity e.g. down-regulates secretion of adiponectin, an&#xD;
           adipokine with anti-inflammatory and insulin-sensitizing properties.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All those pro-atherothrombotic mechanisms in T2D patients could potentially be a subject of&#xD;
      new developments in the treatment, especially in patients with CVD. A therapy that continues&#xD;
      to show great promise in this indication is supplementation with omega-3 polyunsaturated&#xD;
      fatty acids (PUFA) although the underlying mechanism of their beneficial action is not&#xD;
      precisely known. Numerous prospective and retrospective trials have shown that omega-3 PUFA&#xD;
      supplementation decreases the risk of major cardiovascular events, such as myocardial&#xD;
      infarction, sudden cardiac death, coronary heart disease, atrial fibrillation, and most&#xD;
      recently, death in patients with heart failure. However, none of those trials was performed&#xD;
      in T2D patients with CVD who are at the highest risk of events and where benefits could have&#xD;
      considerable clinical importance. Moreover to our knowledge, there are very few randomized,&#xD;
      double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials exploring the mechanisms of omega-3&#xD;
      treatment in T2D patients with documented cardiovascular disease. Despite that fact, Polish&#xD;
      Diabetes Association guidelines recommend the use of omega-3 PUFA in patients with diabetes&#xD;
      in the prevention of macrovascular complications. Moreover, it is unclear whether the&#xD;
      benefits of modifying the pathophysiological processes during supplementation with omega-3&#xD;
      PUFA occur only in patients with their deficiency or in all patients with type 2 diabetes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although there are several potential benefits considering therapy with omega-3 PUFA in T2D&#xD;
      patients with atherosclerotic vascular disease, some of those effects require a detailed&#xD;
      appraisal in a clinical study. They are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Platelet activation and resistance to antiplatelet agents. Platelet dysfunction in&#xD;
           diabetes mellitus is related to several mechanisms - including metabolic derangements,&#xD;
           oxidative stress, and endothelial dysfunction. They lead to high platelet reactivity&#xD;
           which has been associated with atherothrombotic complications in patients with T2DM.&#xD;
           Therefore antiplatelet therapy is one of the cornerstones of secondary prevention of&#xD;
           atherothrombotic events in patients with T2DM.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Recent evidence suggests that the clinical efficacy of both aspirin and clopidogrel is&#xD;
           compromised in subjects in diabetes by mechanisms that are not entirely clear. This is&#xD;
           one of the reasons why diabetic patients continue to have a higher risk of adverse&#xD;
           cardiovascular events compared with that in non-diabetic patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The antiplatelet effect of n-3 PUFA has been explored with inconsistent findings.&#xD;
           Recently, the investigators have demonstrated that the addition of n-3 PUFA to the&#xD;
           combination of aspirin and clopidogrel significantly potentiates platelet response to&#xD;
           clopidogrel after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI).&#xD;
&#xD;
           So far, there are no studies evaluating the effects of n-3 PUFA on platelet reactivity&#xD;
           and response to antiplatelet agents in patients with T2D and CVD.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Coagulation and fibrinolysis. In patients with T2D there is a general increase in plasma&#xD;
           levels of procoagulant factors accompanied by a decreased fibrinolytic capacity.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The mechanisms for these alterations are complex, with insulin resistance and&#xD;
           hyperglycaemia being clear culprits. The net result of the above changes is an increased&#xD;
           tendency to clot formation, with the fibrin network displaying a compact structure and&#xD;
           resistance to fibrinolysis. Moreover, increased fibrinogen levels observed in diabetes&#xD;
           correlate with the degree of hyperglycemia and with fibrinogen glycation affecting&#xD;
           fibrin polymerization and factor XIII-mediated crosslinking. Of note, impaired metabolic&#xD;
           control and marked fluctuations in plasma glucose levels have been shown to be related&#xD;
           to hypofibrinolysis associated with the formation of dense fibrin clots. The differences&#xD;
           in fibrin clot structure and its susceptibility to lysis found to occur in type 2&#xD;
           diabetes may contribute to the increase in CVD risk in diabetic patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
           A number of measures can reduce the hypercoagulable environment in diabetes including&#xD;
           glycaemic control, with avoidance of hypoglycaemia and improvement in insulin&#xD;
           sensitivity. Of the pharmacological agents used in patients with T2D and CVD, metformin,&#xD;
           aspirin, statins and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors have a favourable effect&#xD;
           on the coagulation system and all have been shown to reduce cardiovascular events in&#xD;
           diabetes.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Although it is unclear whether n-3 PUFA has clinically relevant effects on insulin&#xD;
           resistance in humans, they may affect coagulation system directly via several&#xD;
           mechanisms. It has been shown that in apparently healthy subjects, omega-3 PUFA can&#xD;
           increase or decrease plasma fibrinogen and clotting factors, in particular factor VII&#xD;
           activity, factor VIII and von Willebrand factor concentrations. There are studies&#xD;
           indicating that fish oil supplementation may reduce thrombin generation. Conversely,&#xD;
           other studies failed to demonstrate significant changes in circulating markers of&#xD;
           thrombosis following administration of omega-3 PUFA. Of note, these studies have been&#xD;
           conducted in patients without diabetes, so the knowledge on the effects of omega-3 in&#xD;
           T2D patients with CVD treated on optimal pharmacotherapy (including drugs affecting the&#xD;
           coagulation) is limited.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Regarding the effects of omega-3 PUFAs on fibrinolytic activity the findings are&#xD;
           controversial. In a single study performed 20 years ago intake of omega-3 PUFAs has been&#xD;
           associated with increased plasma plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI-1) activity in&#xD;
           non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus patients. Interestingly, in a recent study,&#xD;
           PAI-1 concentration and activity increased more following high omega-3 PUFAs beverage&#xD;
           compared with low omega-3 PUFAs beverage in men with metabolic syndrome. It was also&#xD;
           demonstrated that with respect to fibrinolytic measurements, acute and chronic intake of&#xD;
           fish oil may show opposite effects, although the underlying mechanistic basis for this&#xD;
           is not understood. Further research is needed on this potentially adverse effect on the&#xD;
           coagulation in patients with glycometabolic disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Endothelial dysfunction and oxidative stress A large body of evidence links endothelial&#xD;
           dysfunction to human diabetes mellitus. Endothelial dysfunction in T2D contributes to&#xD;
           the pathogenesis and clinical expression of atherosclerosis by promoting inflammation,&#xD;
           thrombosis, arterial stiffness, and impaired regulation of arterial tone and flow.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Increased oxidative stress in the vasculature is an important mechanism of endothelial&#xD;
           dysfunction and insulin resistance in diabetes mellitus. For example, circulating&#xD;
           markers of oxidative stress, including F2 isoprostanes and antibodies against oxidized&#xD;
           low density lipoprotein, are increased in humans with T2D.&#xD;
&#xD;
           In recent years, growing evidence links the intake of omega-3 PUFA with an improvement&#xD;
           in endothelial function. The mechanisms by which omega-3 PUFAs might influence&#xD;
           endothelial function are likely to be multiple and complex. They could include the&#xD;
           suppression of thromboxane A2 or cyclic endoperoxides, a reduced production of&#xD;
           cytokines, the augmented endothelial synthesis of nitric oxide, an improvement of&#xD;
           vascular smooth muscle cell sensitivity to nitric oxide, and a reduced expression of&#xD;
           endothelial adhesion molecules. The reduction of oxidative stress with omega-3 PUFA in&#xD;
           patients with T2D may be an important factor responsible for the improvement of&#xD;
           endothelial function. However, there is not enough data on the improvement of&#xD;
           endothelial function and the reduction of oxidative stress in patients with T2D and&#xD;
           established CVD.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Inflammation Chronic inflammation may participate in the pathogenesis of insulin&#xD;
           resistance, type 2 diabetes, and cardiovascular disease and may be a common denominator&#xD;
           that links obesity to these disease states. A variety of circulating proinflammatory&#xD;
           cytokines and acute-phase reactants are increased in obesity, type 2 diabetes, and&#xD;
           cardiovascular disease. Moreover, chronic low-grade inflammation occurring in the&#xD;
           adipose tissue of obese individuals is linked to increased insulin resistance and leads&#xD;
           to disturbances in the adipokines secretion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although there are divergent data whether omega-3 PUFA reduce inflammation they may modulate&#xD;
      adipokine secretion from adipose tissue. It was demonstrated that they increase plasma&#xD;
      adiponectin levels, which could be a potential mechanism by which EPA and DHA improve insulin&#xD;
      sensitivity. They also induce leptin and visfatin secretion and reduce the expression of&#xD;
      several proinflammatory cytokines from the adipose tissue, including tumor necrosis factor&#xD;
      TNFα, IL-6, monocyte chemotactic protein MCP-1, and PAI-1. However, there are no clinical&#xD;
      studies whether omega-3 PUFA supplementation can modulate adipose tissue inflammation in T2D&#xD;
      patients with CVD.&#xD;
