    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well tocilizumab works in treating chronic graft-versus-host&#xD;
      disease (GVHD) in patients that have not responded to treatment after at least two prior&#xD;
      therapies. Tocilizumab blocks a protein that stimulates the body's immune system. By blocking&#xD;
      this protein, the investigators may reduce the symptoms of chronic GVHD.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Efficacy will be determined by the proportion of patients with failure free survival (FFS)&#xD;
      at 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Patients achieving a complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) at 6 months based on&#xD;
      clinician judged response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Patients achieving a CR or PR by objective response measures at 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. Failure-free survival (FFS) at 1 year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. Change in steroid dose from enrollment to 6 months (mo).&#xD;
&#xD;
      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Biologic studies will be done to determine possible mechanisms of response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive tocilizumab intravenously (IV) over 1 hour every 2 weeks for 12 weeks (weeks&#xD;
      1, 3, 5, 7, 9, and 11) and then every 4 weeks for 12 weeks (weeks 13, 17, and 21).&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 3 and 6 months.&#xD;
