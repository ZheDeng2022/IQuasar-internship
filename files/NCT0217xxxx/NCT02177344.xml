  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to confirm that chronic dosing of 20 mcg and 40 mcg of&#xD;
      ipratropium bromide, administered via the RESPIMAT device, demonstrates clinical&#xD;
      comparability and similar safety profiles to the 36 mcg dose of ATROVENT® Inhalation Aerosol&#xD;
      (containing chlorinated fluorocarbons (CFC)) in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary&#xD;
      disease (COPD). The efficacy and safety profiles of the two doses administered via the&#xD;
      RESPIMAT device will also be compared to their respective placebo groups&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. All patients must have a diagnosis of COPD and must meet the following spirometric&#xD;
             criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Patients must have relatively stable, moderate to severe airway obstruction with&#xD;
                  a FEV1 =&lt; 65% of predicted normal and FEV1 =&lt; 70% of FVC&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Male or female patients 40 years of age or older&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Patients must have a smoking history of more than ten packs-years. A pack-year is&#xD;
             defined as the equivalent of smoking one pack of 20 cigarettes per day for a year&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Patients must be able to perform pulmonary function tests and maintain records during&#xD;
             the study period, as required in the protocol&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Patients must be able to be trained in the proper use of an inhalation aerosol and the&#xD;
             Respimat device&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. All patients must sign an Informed Consent Form prior to participation in the trial&#xD;
             i.e., at least 24 hours prior to screening (Visit 1)&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Patients with significant diseases other than COPD will be excluded. A significant&#xD;
             disease is defined as a disease, which in the opinion of the investigator, may either&#xD;
             put the patient at risk because of participation in the study or a disease which may&#xD;
             influence the results of the study or the patient's ability to participate in the&#xD;
             study&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Patients with clinically relevant abnormal baseline haematology, blood chemistry or&#xD;
             urinalysis. If the abnormality defines a disease listed as an exclusion criterion, the&#xD;
             patient is excluded&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. All patients with a serum glutamate oxaloacetate transaminase &gt; 80 U/L, serum&#xD;
             glutamate pyruvate transaminase &gt; 80 U/L, bilirubin &gt; 34.2 µmol/L or creatinine &gt;&#xD;
             176.8 µmol/L will be excluded regardless of the clinical condition. Repeat laboratory&#xD;
             evaluation will not be conducted in these subjects&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Patients who have a blood eosinophil count &gt;= 0.6 GI/L. A repeat eosinophil count will&#xD;
             not be conducted in these patients&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Patients with a recent history (i.e., one year or less) of myocardial infarction&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Patients with a recent history (i.e., three years or less) of heart failure or&#xD;
             patients with any cardiac arrhythmia requiring drug therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Patients with a history of cancer, other than treated basal cell carcinoma, within the&#xD;
             last five years&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Patients with a history of life-threatening pulmonary obstruction, or a history of&#xD;
             cystic fibrosis or bronchiectasis&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Patients who have undergone thoracotomy with pulmonary resection. Patients with a&#xD;
             history of a thoracotomy for other reasons should be evaluated as per exclusion&#xD;
             criterion #1&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Patients with a history of asthma, allergic rhinitis or atopy&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Patients with a history of and/or active alcohol or drug abuse&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Patients with known active tuberculosis&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. Patients with an upper respiratory tract infection or COPD exacerbation in the past&#xD;
             six weeks prior to the Screening Visit (Visit 1) or during the baseline period&#xD;
&#xD;
         14. Patients with known symptomatic prostatic hypertrophy, bladder neck obstruction, or&#xD;
             urinary retention&#xD;
&#xD;
         15. Patients with known narrow-angle glaucoma, or raised intra-ocular pressure&#xD;
&#xD;
         16. Patients with current significant psychiatric disorders&#xD;
&#xD;
         17. Patients with regular use of daytime oxygen therapy&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
         19. Patients who are being treated with antihistamines&#xD;
&#xD;
         20. Patients using oral corticosteroid medication at unstable doses (i.e., less than six&#xD;
             weeks on a stable dose) or at a dose in excess of the equivalent of 10 mg of&#xD;
             prednisone per day or 20 mg every other day&#xD;
&#xD;
         21. Patients who are being treated with beta-blocker medication&#xD;
&#xD;
         22. Patients who have had changes in their therapeutic plan within the last six weeks&#xD;
             prior to the Screening Visit (Visit 1)&#xD;
&#xD;
         23. Pregnant or nursing women or women of childbearing potential not using a medically&#xD;
             approved means of contraception (i.e., oral contraceptives, intrauterine devices or&#xD;
             diaphragm with spermicide, or Norplant®)&#xD;
&#xD;
         24. Patients with known hypersensitivity to anticholinergic drugs or any other components&#xD;
             of the ATROVENT® Solution including Benzalkonium chloride and Edetic acid&#xD;
&#xD;
         25. Patients who have taken an investigational drug within one month or six half lives&#xD;
             (whichever is greater) prior to Screening Visit (Visit 1)&#xD;
