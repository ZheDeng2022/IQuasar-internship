  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Occlusion training, resistance exercise performed with a specialized venous tourniquet, leads&#xD;
      to beneficial changes in muscle at low resistance and minimal stress on the nearby joint.&#xD;
      This novel resistance training has the potential to greatly improve extremity muscle strength&#xD;
      gains for rehabilitation patients who are unable for medical reasons to perform high&#xD;
      resistance exercise. Our study will explore this with specific rehabilitation populations:&#xD;
      post-operative knee scopes, post-operative anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction&#xD;
      patients who have acute post-operative changes in thigh muscle function and chronic thigh&#xD;
      weakness. The primary outcome is to achieve accelerated functional thigh recovery with&#xD;
      outcome measures including thigh strength, validated questionnaires, and validated functional&#xD;
      testing. Occlusion training can enhance rehab patients outcomes, reduce the cost of care, and&#xD;
      improve the skills and efficiency of care providers.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Occlusion training is the restriction of venous outflow from an extremity with the use of a&#xD;
      tourniquet during weight-training or resistance exercises. The technique is a safe and&#xD;
      effective method of improving strength through muscle hypertrophy in healthy, active&#xD;
      individuals (1-7). The technique has also been shown to be safe and effective in patient&#xD;
      populations with various comorbidities (8).These strength gains can be achieved while&#xD;
      training with loads as low as 20% of an individual's one repetition maximum (1RM). This is&#xD;
      contrary to the American College of Sports Medicine (ACSM) weight-training guidelines that&#xD;
      state muscle hypertrophy can only be achieved when an individual lifts loads close to 80% of&#xD;
      the 1RM (9).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this project is to compare occlusion resistance training to traditional&#xD;
      resistance training methods for rehabilitation patients. This will include both an acute&#xD;
      post-operative ACL reconstruction cohort and a chronic thigh weakness cohort. Post-operative&#xD;
      lower extremity weakness as well as chronic muscle weakness after trauma correlate with lower&#xD;
      functional performance.(10,11) We will treat the patients and follow these two cohorts&#xD;
      simultaneously.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 1: To determine if occlusion training will accelerate the recovery of thigh&#xD;
      muscle function and strength in post-operative anterior cruciate ligament (ACL)&#xD;
      reconstruction as compared to a standard post-operative rehabilitation protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 2: To determine if occlusion training will increase quadricep and hamstring&#xD;
      muscle function for battlefield wounded warriors with severe thigh weakness as a result of&#xD;
      trauma or volumetric muscle loss as compared to standard ACSM resistance training guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 3: To determine if occlusion training will accelerate the recovery of thigh&#xD;
      muscle function and strength in post-operative soft tissue knee arthroscopy as compared to a&#xD;
      standard post-operative rehabilitation protocol.&#xD;
