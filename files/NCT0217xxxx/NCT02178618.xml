  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Endoscopic retrograde biliary drainage with a self-expandable metal stent (SEMS) has been&#xD;
      used as a principle palliative method of distal biliary obstruction in patients with&#xD;
      pancreaticobiliary cancers. With potentially curative surgical resection being impossible,&#xD;
      the maintenance of successful biliary drainage through patent stent has been regarded as the&#xD;
      key to improve the quality of life and survival of patient, because it could prevent biliary&#xD;
      infection or liver failure, and give patients opportunities for anti-cancer chemotherapy&#xD;
      and/or radiotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although SEMSs have been reported to be superior to large bore plastic stents in terms of&#xD;
      stent patency, they still have some controversial issues to resolve in relation to stent&#xD;
      dysfunction and adverse event. It has been widely accepted that covered SEMSs designed to&#xD;
      overcome the stent failure of uncovered SEMSs related to tumor ingrowth, have significant&#xD;
      higher rate of stent migration as well as tumor overgrowth. Therefore covered SEMSs did not&#xD;
      show the clear clinical excellence in the cumulative stent patency over uncovered SEMSs,&#xD;
      despite some clinical results of randomized trials favor to covered SEMSs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      From the perspective of adverse events such as pancreatitis and cholecystitis, conflicting&#xD;
      results have been produced. It was initially assumed that covered SEMSs could cause the&#xD;
      higher incidence of pancreatitis and cholecystitis attributed to occlusion of pancreatic duct&#xD;
      and cystic duct by covering materials. However, no significant difference was found with&#xD;
      regard to the incidence of pancreatitis and cholecystitis between covered and uncovered SEMSs&#xD;
      in several randomized trials and meta-analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the current study is to compare the cumulative stent patency of partially covered&#xD;
      and uncovered SEMS as a primary objective, and investigate overall patient survival, stent&#xD;
      dysfunction-free patient survival, and incidence of adverse events including stent&#xD;
      dysfunction as secondary objectives.&#xD;
