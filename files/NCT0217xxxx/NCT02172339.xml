        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Subjects:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Subject with normal renal function ( creatinine clearance of 80% of predicted&#xD;
                  creatinine clearance in healthy volunteers), as confirmed by normal physical&#xD;
                  examination including vital signs, ECG and laboratory values&#xD;
&#xD;
                  Calculated creatinine clearance (male);&#xD;
&#xD;
                  = ((140 - age(yr)) x (Wt (kg))) / (72 x predicted serum creatinine (mg/dL))&#xD;
&#xD;
                  Calculated creatinine clearance (female);&#xD;
&#xD;
                  = ((140 - age(yr)) x (Wt(kg))) / (85 x predicted serum creatinine (mg/dL))&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Subject with impaired renal function must be of age related good health and&#xD;
                  without clinically significant abnormalities as assessed during the physical&#xD;
                  examination. Mildly impaired renal patients were defined as those with creatinine&#xD;
                  clearance of 40 - 80% of predicted creatinine clearance; moderately impaired&#xD;
                  renal patients were defined as those with creatinine clearance of 10 - 40% of&#xD;
                  predicted creatinine clearance. Laboratory values of subjects with renal&#xD;
                  impairment could have been outside the normal range if the deviations were due to&#xD;
                  the underlying renal disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Male or female, age between 40 and 70 years with normal body - weight index (+/- 25%,&#xD;
             Broca-index)&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Subjects with normal 12 - lead ECG recording&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Subjects with normal physical examination&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Subjects with normal clinical and laboratory tests (except for indicators of renal&#xD;
             impairment)&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Female of child bearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. All subjects must have a negative HIV-Ab test and negative Hepatitis B test&#xD;

        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Subjects with a history of more then moderate alcohol consumption (more than 1 litre&#xD;
             of beer per day or the equivalent amount of alcohol in any other alcoholic beverage,&#xD;
             approximately 50 g of alcohol per day). 24 hours before dosing and 24 hours post&#xD;
             dosing, alcohol was not permitted&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Present or past participation in a drug detoxification program&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Smokers&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Subjects requiring any concomitant medication not compatible with this study&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Subjects with hypotension (systolic blood pressure less than 100 mmHg, diastolic less&#xD;
             than 60 mmHg) or hypertension (systolic blood pressure more than 165 mmHg or diastolic&#xD;
             more than 100 mmHg) under adequate medication&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Subjects who participated in a clinical trial of any other investigational drug within&#xD;
             two months prior to the start of this study&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Pregnant or lactating women or women of child bearing potential not using a medically&#xD;
             approved means contraception. (i.e., oral contraceptives, intrauterine devices,&#xD;
             diaphragm)&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Subjects who donated blood within three months prior to the start of the study&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Subjects with a history of chronic or recurrent convulsive disorders or ongoing&#xD;
             hepatic dysfunction&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Subjects with ongoing acute systemic illness or recovery from acute systemic illness&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Subjects with a history of cancer within the last five years&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Subjects with known hypersensitivity to anticholinergic drugs&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. Subjects with known symptomatic prostatic hypertrophy or bladder neck obstruction&#xD;
&#xD;
         14. Subjects with known narrow-angle glaucoma&#xD;
