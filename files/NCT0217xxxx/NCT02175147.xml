    <textblock>
      Rationale: Palliative care integration in treatment pathways, palliative care networks and&#xD;
      institutional collaborations in health services delivery seems a promising approach reducing&#xD;
      fragmentation and discontinuity. Integrated Palliative Care (IPC) approaches in Europe are&#xD;
      largely unknown and under-investigated. The investigators aim is to explore experiences of&#xD;
      patients with advanced cancer, Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) and Chronic Heart&#xD;
      Failure (CHF), family and professional caregivers within with IPC. This includes perceived&#xD;
      quality of life, quality of care, burden/rewards of care giving, symptoms and collaboration&#xD;
      between caregivers in the patient's care network.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives: To investigate how patients with advanced cancer, COPD and CHF, their family and&#xD;
      professional caregivers within a selection of IPC initiatives in Belgium, Germany, Hungary,&#xD;
      The Netherlands and United Kingdom experience care delivery in the last phase of disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To investigate what opinions patients and family caregivers have on the (continuity and)&#xD;
           quality of care delivered&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To investigate how patients rate their symptoms and quality of life&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To investigate how family caregivers rate their burden / rewards of care giving&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To investigate how the care network of the patient is organised with respect to the&#xD;
           type, properties and quality of relationships between patients and family / professional&#xD;
           caregivers&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design: Longitudinal multiple embedded case study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population: Adult patients with advanced cancer, COPD, and CHF under the care of IPC&#xD;
      initiatives in five participating countries, their family and professional caregivers. The&#xD;
      investigators aim to enroll up to 288 patients, 288 family caregivers and 192 professional&#xD;
      caregivers in total.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study parameters: Experiences with IPC initiatives, quality of care, quality of life,&#xD;
      perceived symptoms, perceived collaboration between professional caregivers, burden and&#xD;
      rewards of care giving.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: Semi-structured interviews, patient diary, Social Network Analysis and the following&#xD;
      questionnaires: Palliative care Outcome Scale; Canhelp Lite, Caregiver Reaction Assessment.&#xD;
      Patients and family caregivers will be followed over 3 months at 4 consecutive contact&#xD;
      points. The diary (containing two questions) will be kept weekly by patients. There will be&#xD;
      group or individual interviews with professional caregivers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis: The overall analysis will involve a synthesis of the qualitative and quantitative&#xD;
      data. For more information see Detailed Description.&#xD;

      Monitoring and Quality Assurance:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Training for researchers:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to ensure the best quality of the study, researchers will take part in at least two&#xD;
      compulsory training sessions. During the training ethical and professional issues will also&#xD;
      be discussed, such as:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  ethical issues (e.g. handling vulnerable groups in interview situations)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  data management (protection of privacy of medical and research records)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  interview training in order to standardise interview techniques&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  how to analyse qualitative and quantitative data, and how to synthesize them in this&#xD;
           research (to the analysing researchers in the partner countries).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Qualitative data:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interviews will be tape recorded and transcribed verbatim, and will be evaluated with content&#xD;
      analysis using qualitative software package NVivo 10. After two pilot interviews responsible&#xD;
      researchers from each partner country will discuss a preliminary code book. These codes and&#xD;
      themes will form the basis of the coding strategy throughout data collection and the data&#xD;
      analysis. Analysis will be ongoing throughout the fieldwork in order to allow emergent themes&#xD;
      to be fed back into the data collection. During data collection new relevant codes will be&#xD;
      included in the code book.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The interviews will be coded in the national languages of the five countries under&#xD;
      examination. This will result in five country reports about the experiences of patients with&#xD;
      advanced cancer, COPD and CHF, their family and professional caregivers within a selection of&#xD;
      IPC initiatives in the particular country with the care delivery in the last phase of&#xD;
      disease. These country reports will be translated into English and will be analysed and&#xD;
      result in one overall report.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Quantitative data:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis will be performed using SPSS Statistics 20. The investigators will use&#xD;
      descriptive statistics such as frequencies, crosstabs, means, standard deviation. The&#xD;
      quantitative data will be used as a background description of the population. The overall&#xD;
      analysis will involve a synthesis of the qualitative and quantitative data. During the&#xD;
      analysis phase the investigators will integrate the quantitative variables, qualitative&#xD;
      findings and evaluations in order to get complete insight in the topic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatments for missing data:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will use the following approach to missing data: to omit questions with&#xD;
      missing data and to perform analyses of questions on what remains. Missing data will be&#xD;
      accounted for in the analysis and the implications will be made clear.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Handling and storage of data and documents:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The confidentiality of data collected within the patient study will be secured according to&#xD;
      national and European regulation. Data from patients will be anonymised and disclosure of&#xD;
      information from the study to third parties will be limited to those undertaking legitimate&#xD;
      peer review of the scientific and ethical aspects of the study, co-workers and patients, so&#xD;
      that consent can be obtained and customary medical care can be provided.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient confidentiality and welfare will always be maintained as the highest priority. All&#xD;
      data gathered and documents will be stored anonymously. Each patient, family caregiver and&#xD;
      professional caregiver will be allocated a unique identification number. No identifying&#xD;
      information linking the person and identification number will be kept on the data base. The&#xD;
      investigators will analyze data by identification number only. Patient data will be stored in&#xD;
      a protected database with log function. The master database will be kept at the centre of the&#xD;
      research coordinator of the Radboud University Medical Centre.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessment of progress and quality:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Researchers (who will do fieldwork at IPC initiatives involved) will report fieldwork&#xD;
      progress (patient recruitment and data collection) and the quality of data collected every&#xD;
      other week to their lead researcher (who is responsible for the research in the particular&#xD;
      country). Contents of the progress and quality report:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Number of persons (patients and family caregivers) involved&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Number of completed questionnaires and interviews&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Quality of completed questionnaires and interviews&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Attrition (death of patients, early terminated interviews)&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Other research-related events (e.g. delays)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lead researchers will summarize researches' reports and send a progress and quality report to&#xD;
      the study principal investigator every month (The study principal investigator is responsible&#xD;
      for the research in the framework of InSup-C project.)&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study principal investigator organizes a 3-monthly structure of (tele)conference to&#xD;
      monitor progress and quality and to report this to the Project Management Office (PMO). The&#xD;
      PMO works under supervision of the Executive Board of the project. The PMO will provide the&#xD;
      Executive Board with project process reports at least every six months or more frequently if&#xD;
      necessary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Annual progress report:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Principal Investigator will submit a summary of the progress of the study to the&#xD;
      accredited ethical committee once a year. Information will be provided on the date of&#xD;
      inclusion of the first subject, numbers of subjects included and numbers of subjects that&#xD;
      have completed the trial, (serious) adverse events, other problems, and amendments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      End of study report:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Principal Investigator will notify the accredited ethical committee of the end of the&#xD;
      study within a period of eight weeks. The end of the study is defined as the last study&#xD;
      participant's last interview. In case the study is ended prematurely, the responsible&#xD;
      researcher will notify the accredited ethical committee within 15 days, including the reasons&#xD;
      for the premature termination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Within one year after the end of the study, the responsible researcher will submit a final&#xD;
      study report with the results of the study, including any publications/abstracts of the&#xD;
      study, to the accredited ethical committee.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Public disclosure and publication policy:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Public disclosure and publication policy is regulated by InSup-C. Dissemination Strategy&#xD;
      (October 2013), available at request. An outline publication timeline with suggested topics,&#xD;
      lead work package author and scientific target journals is detailed in the Dissemination&#xD;
      Strategy. An interactive website has been developed. The website will signpost study results&#xD;
      as these become available.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Monitoring level related to risk classification:&#xD;
&#xD;
      As in the previous section it was estimated that this study has a negligible risk, minimal&#xD;
      monitoring will take place. Table 4 displays the activities the monitor will perform.&#xD;
      Monitoring will be conducted by a qualified monitor who has knowledge of current legislation&#xD;
      and regulation and who is independent from this study. Findings will be reported to the&#xD;
      coordinating investigator of the Radboud umc in a fixed format. If the monitor identifies&#xD;
      substantial and/or frequent faults, this will be reported to the head of the department&#xD;
      and/or the company board.&#xD;

        In Belgium, Germany, Hungary, The Netherlands and United Kingdom 3-5 'model initiatives' of&#xD;
        palliative care were selected. From each initiative, patients with advanced cancer, COPD&#xD;
        and CHF, their family and professional caregivers are recruited. Patients (and if presented&#xD;
        the family caregiver) are recruited by their main responsible doctor or (research) nurse&#xD;
        involved in the initiative under examination. Participants need to meet the inclusion and&#xD;
        exclusion criteria in order to be eligible for the study. A family caregiver is defined as&#xD;
        the person who takes care and supports the patient for most of the time. Family caregivers&#xD;
        are not necessarily a family member. Professional caregivers involved in the IPC&#xD;
        initiatives under examination are invited for the group interviews.&#xD;
