    <textblock>
      Bulimia nervosa is a severe psychiatric disorder characterized by recurrent binge eating&#xD;
      episodes followed by inappropriate compensatory behavior to prevent weight gain such as&#xD;
      self-induced vomiting. With this project, the investigators want to investigate the role of&#xD;
      the neurotransmitter dopamine in bulimia nervosa. Dopamine is reported to have an important&#xD;
      influence on the neural reward system and is involved in the processing of gains and losses.&#xD;
      The reward system is functionally connected to the individual perception of rewards in the&#xD;
      environment. A previous study revealed that under catecholamine depletion including dopamine&#xD;
      depletion women suffering from bulimia nervosa in their past reported mild bulimic symptoms&#xD;
      and their reward processing became dysfunctional: their ability to use rewarding stimuli for&#xD;
      task solving was diminished.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to investigate the role of reduced dopamine availability in the&#xD;
      development or maintaining of bulimia nervosa and in the dysfunctional processing of&#xD;
      rewarding stimuli and negative visual information. Therefore, the investigators hypothesize&#xD;
      that catecholamine depletion achieved by oral administration of alpha-methyl-paratyrosine&#xD;
      (AMPT) will induce mild bulimic symptoms in females suffering from bulimia nervosa in their&#xD;
      past. In addition, they will reveal dysfunctions in reward and emotional processing under&#xD;
      catecholamine depletion. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging, the investigators&#xD;
      propose that a reduced activation of the nucleus accumbens, a neural structure of the reward&#xD;
      system, will be the neural correlate of this dysfunctional reward processing. Furthermore,&#xD;
      the amygdala, a neural structure that is involved in emotional processing, will show a higher&#xD;
      activation under catecholamine depletion. Genetic factors additionally have an influence on&#xD;
      the dopaminergic system. Therefore, the investigators hypothesize that genetic factors, for&#xD;
      example the COMT val-158-met polymorphism may have an effect on the behavioral and neural&#xD;
      response to catecholamine depletion. In sum, this investigation may help to understand which&#xD;
      changes in reward and emotional processing may lead to a reoccurrence of bulimic symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In future, the findings of this study may help to develop individual pharmacological and&#xD;
      psychotherapeutical interventions to enhance the outcome of treatment.&#xD;

      Background&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Monoamine Deficiency Hypothesis is one of the most solid theories of the neurobiology of&#xD;
      mood, anxiety disorder, and addiction. There is increasing evidence that monoamine deficiency&#xD;
      also plays an important role in bulimia nervosa. Many indications revealed a disturbance of&#xD;
      the catecholamine system in bulimia nervosa. In symptomatic bulimic patients, the&#xD;
      concentration of norepinephrine and dopamine in cerebrospinal fluid and peripheral blood was&#xD;
      lower than in healthy controls. The neurotransmitter dopamine is thought to be importantly&#xD;
      involved in the processing of rewarding stimuli.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One instructive paradigm for investigating the relationship between catecholaminergic&#xD;
      function and psychiatric disorders has involved the behavioral response to catecholamine&#xD;
      depletion achieved by oral administration of alpha-methyl-paratyrosine (AMPT). This&#xD;
      medication is a tyrosine hydroxylase inhibitor and, therefore, it reduces availability of&#xD;
      catecholamines in the brain by depleting central norepinephrine and dopamine stores. A&#xD;
      relatively large interindividual variation in the response to catecholamine depletion has&#xD;
      been consistently observed. Genetic factors may conceivably contribute to this variation. The&#xD;
      COMT val-158-met polymorphism was found to play a critical role for the activity of the&#xD;
      enzyme catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) that metabolizes catecholamines after they have&#xD;
      been released into the synaptic cleft. The enzyme activity in individuals homozygous for the&#xD;
      val-158 allele is about 40% higher than in homozygotes of the met-158 allele. A high activity&#xD;
      of this enzyme is thought to be associated with a higher reduction of catecholamines,&#xD;
      particularly of dopamine in the prefrontal cortex.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a previous study Gregor Hasler and colleagues were the first to use catecholamine&#xD;
      depletion to evaluate the roles played by norepinephrine and dopamine in the pathophysiology&#xD;
      of bulimia nervosa. The results of this study revealed that under catecholamine depletion&#xD;
      remitted bulimic participants showed dysfunctions in motivated behavior in a reward task. In&#xD;
      addition this study provided preliminary evidence that COMT val-158-met polymorphism explains&#xD;
      some of the variance in the behavioral response to catecholamine depletion. However, in&#xD;
      eating disorders, the pathway leading from genetic polymorphism to neural activity to&#xD;
      neuropsychological abnormalities to risk of eating disorders remains to be determined.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With this new study the investigators want to investigate the neural substrate of the induced&#xD;
      bulimia-associated neuropsychological abnormalities with functional magnetic resonance&#xD;
      imaging (fMRI). An additional goal is to examine the effect of the COMT val-158-met&#xD;
      polymorphism on neural activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the following the investigators will present their central hypotheses:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Remitted bulimic participants will reveal impairments in motivated behavior and abnormal&#xD;
           neural activation in a reward task following catecholamine depletion.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Remitted bulimic participants will show increased amygdala activation during encoding of&#xD;
           negative pictures under catecholamine depletion.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Participants with homozygous val-158 alleles of the COMT val-158-met polymorphism will&#xD;
           show an increased activation in the ventral striatum during a reward task.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Participants with at least one met-158 allele of the COMT val-158-met polymorphism will&#xD;
           show higher amygdala activation during the encoding of negative emotional visual&#xD;
           information.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will further elucidate the etiology and pathophysiology of bulimia nervosa at&#xD;
      various levels, ranging from the role of a specific genetic factor to the activity of&#xD;
      specific neural networks to neuropsychological abnormalities and clinical symptoms. It may&#xD;
      provide important insights into a specific pathogenetic pathway of bulimia nervosa related to&#xD;
      the catecholaminergic in particular to the dopaminergic neurotransmitter system. Since a&#xD;
      range of drugs targeting this neurotransmitter system are available, this study may directly&#xD;
      inform the development of novel therapeutic strategies tailored to individual patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      Remitted bulimic and healthy control participants will be enrolled into a double-blind,&#xD;
      placebo-controlled cross-over catecholamine/sham depletion study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The initial assessment comprises physical examinations, a structured psychiatric interview,&#xD;
      clinical ratings and neuropsychological testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Catecholamine depletion will be induced by administration of AMPT over 24 hours. Sham&#xD;
      depletion includes diphenhydramine at the first medication intake time point because AMPT&#xD;
      mostly induce mild sedation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on previous reports, the investigators expect maximal depletion 30 hours after the&#xD;
      first dose AMPT. Blood samples will be taken at that time to measure serum prolactin levels&#xD;
      as a proxy of catecholamine synthesis. Behavioral experiments (tasks assessing reward and&#xD;
      emotional processing) will be conducted in a MR-scanner. The participants will complete&#xD;
      various self-report ratings before the first, during and after medication intake.&#xD;
