  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a cluster randomised controlled trial covering all general practitioners working in&#xD;
      the National Health System (SNS) and all pharmacists working in community pharmacies in the&#xD;
      area covered by the Health Region Administration of Center (ARS-C) . A specific educative&#xD;
      intervention, designed from gaps detected in knowledge and attitudes with respect to&#xD;
      antibiotics and resistance, will be carried out on the intervention group. The control group&#xD;
      will not receive any specific intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypotheses:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The attitudes and knowledge towards antibiotics generate habits of prescription by&#xD;
           physicians&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The attitudes and knowledge towards to antibiotics generate propensity to dispense&#xD;
           antibiotics without prescription by pharmacists&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. The identification of the attitudes, knowledge and factors that generate habits of&#xD;
           inadequate prescription will allow the design of specific educative interventions to&#xD;
           improve the use of antibiotics&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. The identification of the attitudes, knowledge and factors that generate propensity to&#xD;
           dispense antibiotics without prescription will allow the design of specific educative&#xD;
           interventions to antibiotic use&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. The interventions designed from gaps detected in knowledge and attitudes with respect to&#xD;
           antibiotics and resistance will improve the prescription and dispensation of antibiotics&#xD;
           by physicians and pharmacists, respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. The intervention will collaborate in the control of the bacterial resistance.&#xD;

      The intervention will consist of group outreach visits (40 minutes), and will be targeted at&#xD;
      changing the knowledge-attitudes previously found to be associated with poor prescribing of&#xD;
      antibiotics in the case of physicians and propensity to dispense antibiotics without medical&#xD;
      prescription in the case of pharmacists.. An observational cohort study of a sample of 1100&#xD;
      primary care physicians and 1200 community pharmacists will be carried out to identify&#xD;
      knowledge-attitudes associated with inappropriate prescribing of antibiotics. The independent&#xD;
      variables (knowledge-attitudes) will be assessed by a self-administered postal questionnaire&#xD;
      and dependent variables are some quantity and quality indicators of the prescribing&#xD;
      antibiotics, and consumption data.&#xD;
