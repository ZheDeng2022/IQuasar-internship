  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to identify the effects of lisdexamfetamine (LDX) on the neural&#xD;
      and behavioral subcomponents of self-control, that is cognitive control and reward&#xD;
      functioning, in adolescents and young adults with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that LDX is associated with 1a) decreased task-independent&#xD;
      locus coeruleus (LC) activity; 1b) increased task-related activity in LC and the cognitive&#xD;
      control network; 2) increased LC connectivity with the cognitive control network and 3)&#xD;
      improved task performance and self-control. The investigators will test their hypotheses on&#xD;
      fMRI data with linear contrasts of voxel-wise maps of parameter estimates (in both univariate&#xD;
      and connectivity analyses).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will also assess change in brain activity with the LDX in the LC and&#xD;
      ventral tegmental areas (VTA) as we hypothesize that they are altered in ADHD and related to&#xD;
      cognitive control and self-control dysfunction in ADHD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will use a repeated-measures, between-subject design to compare the effects&#xD;
      of oral once daily LDX in a double-blind placebo-controlled randomized trial (RCT) on neural&#xD;
      (fMRI) and behavioral correlates of cognitive control via a working memory and a reward -&#xD;
      delay discounting task in adolescents and young adults.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A new condition has been added which will use a within-subject comparison, cross-over design&#xD;
      between a single dose of LDX versus a single dose of placebo.&#xD;

&#xD;
          3. This includes a history of childhood symptoms of ADHD for the adult subjects&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. The subject, a caregiver, and the investigator must all agree that the present ADHD&#xD;
             symptoms cause impairment in the subject's normal routines, which include academic&#xD;
             achievement, occupational functioning, social activities, and/or relationships&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Females of childbearing potential (defined by menarche and not having undergone&#xD;
             surgical sterilization/hysterectomy) must have a negative pregnancy test, must be&#xD;
             practicing acceptable methods of contraception (or can confirm abstinence at each&#xD;

             participating in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Written informed consent must be obtained from a legally acceptable representative&#xD;
             (e.g. guardian or caregiver for minors), in accordance with requirements of the&#xD;
             Institutional Review Board (IRB), prior to the initiation of any protocol-required&#xD;
             procedures. In addition, the subject, as required by the IRB, must provide informed&#xD;
             assent at screening and as such must be able to understand that he or she can withdraw&#xD;
             from the time at any time.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. The subject and the designated guardian(s) or caregiver(s)[If minors] are able to&#xD;

                  investigator's judgment, preclude further exposure to LDX&#xD;
&#xD;
               5. The subject had protocol violations during the trial considered major in the&#xD;
                  judgment of the investigator (significant noncompliance, use of prohibited&#xD;
                  concomitant medications, concern with use of drugs of abuse, etc.), which would&#xD;
                  deem them poor candidates for this trial&#xD;
&#xD;
               6. Sexually active males who will not commit to utilizing an approved birth control&#xD;
                  methods or who will not remain abstinent during the trial and for 90 days&#xD;
                  following the last dose of study drug. Sexually active females of childbearing&#xD;
                  potential who will not commit to utilizing 1 of the approved birth control&#xD;

                  the following precautions must be used: vasectomy, tubal ligation, vaginal&#xD;
                  diaphragm, intrauterine device, birth control pill, birth control depot&#xD;

                  to continue&#xD;
&#xD;
               9. Contraindication for MRI scanning (e.g., metal implants, pacemakers, metal&#xD;
                  foreign bodies, pregnancy)&#xD;

               3. Dextroamphetamine is known to inhibit monoamine oxidase, as well as a metabolite&#xD;
                  of furazolidone. Concurrent administration of monoamine oxidase (MAOI) inhibitors&#xD;
                  is contraindicated because MAOIs potentially can result in hypertensive crisis.&#xD;
                  Vyvanse should not be given for at least 14 days after discontinuation of an MAO&#xD;
                  inhibitor.&#xD;

                  antidepressants, meperidine, Norepinephrine, Phenobarbital, Phenytoin.&#xD;
&#xD;

             their formulation&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Previous negative history with LDX&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Active drug or alcohol use or dependence that, in the opinion of the site&#xD;
             investigator, would interfere with adherence to study requirements&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. A positive drug screen for cocaine or other drugs of abuse (excluding caffeine,&#xD;
                  nicotine or prescribed psychostimulants for ADD/ADHD)&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. History of substance dependence or abuse disorder currently or within past 5&#xD;
