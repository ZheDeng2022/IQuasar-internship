  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective is to determine the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics (PK) of 2 single&#xD;
      doses of ZTI-01 (1g and 8g infused over 1-hr) and a single dose of the Reference Label Drug,&#xD;
      Monurol® (oral sachet, 3g). Subjects will be randomized to a treatment sequence prior to&#xD;
      dosing on Day 1 of Period 1 prior to study screening.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1 single-dose, randomized, 3-Period, crossover study conducted at a single&#xD;
      center. A total of 30 healthy subjects, aged 18-45years, will be randomized to receive one of&#xD;
      3 treatment sequences. The duration of study will be approximately 18-26 days and subject&#xD;
      participation will be the duration of study. Each treatment sequence will be enrolled in&#xD;
      parallel and each subject will receive all 3 treatments in crossover fashion. Each subject&#xD;
      will complete Screening, Baseline, and Treatment Phases. The Screening Phase will be&#xD;
      conducted on an outpatient basis within 35 days of admission (Day -1 of Period 1). All&#xD;
      subjects admitted to the study center the day before dosing in each treatment period (Day -1;&#xD;
      check-in) for pre-dosing assessments and will remain in the study center through 48 hours&#xD;
      post-dose for each Period. Final baseline qualification will only be evaluated prior to&#xD;
      randomization for Treatment Period 1. Each one of the periods will be separated by a 3&#xD;
      (minimum) to 7 days (maximum) washout period. The Treatment Phase will be comprised of 3&#xD;
      crossover periods (duration Day-1 to 48 hours post dose). Each crossover period will include&#xD;
      a single dose of study drug under fasting conditions followed by post-dose safety assessments&#xD;
      and blood and urine collection for PK measures through 48 hours post-dose; each period will&#xD;
      be separated by a 3 to 7 days washout. Subjects will remain in the study center for all 3-&#xD;
      study treatment periods (Day -1 to 48 hours post dosing) and will be discharged after the&#xD;
      48-hour sampling timepoint (if safety parameters are acceptable to the Investigator on Day&#xD;
      3).&#xD;
