  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Diabetes Distress (DD) refers to the emotional and behavioral challenges and burdens that&#xD;
      arise through living with and managing diabetes. High DD is characterized by feeling&#xD;
      frustrated, overwhelmed and discouraged by the demands of diabetes, and high DD may have a&#xD;
      negative impact on disease management and glycemic control; poor glycemic control can also&#xD;
      have a negative effect on DD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Few interventions have been assessed that directly target DD or mood in adults with Type 1&#xD;
      diabetes. In this study the investigators will compare two active, evidence-based behavioral&#xD;
      interventions to reduce high DD and improve glycemic control and disease management:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. A Type 1 diabetes education protocol ('KnowIt') that brings together new advances in&#xD;
           diabetes education and behavioral management.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. A DD-reduction protocol ('OnTrack') that helps identify and address the personal&#xD;
           stresses and strains of having diabetes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants in both arms will attend a single, day-long workshop, four hour-long web group&#xD;
      meetings and four personal phone calls with the group facilitator during the intervention&#xD;
      period. Assessments will be carried out at baseline and at three and nine months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 1: OnTrack will be superior to KnowIt in the primary and secondary outcomes at&#xD;
      follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 2: Changes in self-efficacy and fear of hypoglycemia over time will mediate the&#xD;
      difference between the two study arms and primary outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 3: The differences between the two study arms and changes in the primary outcomes&#xD;
      will be qualified by patient characteristics such as age, length of diagnosis, higher&#xD;
      baseline distress or HbA1c.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A behavioral randomized control trial (RCT) for high diabetes distress. In Phase 2 we propose&#xD;
      a practical two-arm, nine month RCT to reduce high DD and improve glycemic control and&#xD;
      disease management. We will compare two active interventions: (1) a Type 1 diabetes education&#xD;
      protocol ('KnowIt') that brings together new advances in diabetes education and behavioral&#xD;
      management, and (2) A DD-reduction protocol ('OnTrack') that helps identify and address the&#xD;
      personal stresses and strains of having diabetes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients in both study arms will receive three months of intervention and six months of&#xD;
      follow-up. Each arm includes a one-day in-person group workshop for 8-10 participants; four&#xD;
      real-time, 65-minute web-based group meetings; and six individual telephone calls from the&#xD;
      group leader. The web-based meetings will occur at two, four, eight and 12 weeks after the&#xD;
      workshop. Four of the personal phone calls will occur one week prior to each web-based group&#xD;
      meeting to provide support and encourage participation in the group meetings; two personal&#xD;
      phone calls will occur at weeks 20 and 28 (between months thee and nine) to maintain support&#xD;
      and participation. Assessment will take place at baseline, 12 and 36 weeks from the initial&#xD;
      workshop.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypotheses:&#xD;
&#xD;
      H1. The OnTrack arm will be superior to KnowIt on the primary outcomes (HbA1c and DD) and the&#xD;
      secondary outcomes (diabetes management) at 12 and 36 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      H2. (mediator hypothesis). Differential between-group change in primary outcomes will be&#xD;
      mediated by changes in self-efficacy and fear of hypoglycemia across time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      H3. (moderator hypothesis). The differences between the two study arms and changes in the&#xD;
      primary outcomes will be qualified by: (a) patient characteristics, with stronger positive&#xD;
      effects for patients with younger age, shorter diabetes duration, higher baseline distress or&#xD;
      HbA1c, BMI, and more frequent hypoglycemic episodes; and (b) intervention engagement, with&#xD;
      stronger positive effects for patients who attend more calls or have higher use of&#xD;
      intervention media. We will test our findings against the null hypothesis of no difference&#xD;
      between the two groups. All statistical tests will be two tailed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analyses:&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will perform analyses to determine whether differential attrition occurred by patient&#xD;
      characteristics. Likelihood based approaches (e.g. GLMMs) and multiple imputation will be&#xD;
      used to handle missing data. Background demographics will be examined to describe the sample&#xD;
      and will be included in multivariate analysis if they are related to the outcome at p&lt;.2,&#xD;
      differ between treatment arms, or associated with dropout. Correlations among variables will&#xD;
      be examined and redundant measures will be combined or eliminated to avoid multicollinearity.&#xD;
      We will select potential moderators by retaining those at p&lt;.2 and then reassessing models to&#xD;
      assess for significant interactions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessment of Primary &amp; Secondary Outcomes: We will fit regression models for cross-sectional&#xD;
      and longitudinal outcomes. Demographics will be compared for the two arms at baseline.&#xD;
      Comparisons of OnTrack and KnowIt on changes in DD and HbA1c will be estimated with linear&#xD;
      mixed models and generalized linear models with generalized estimating equations (e.g., SAS&#xD;
      PROC MIXED ROC GENMOD, SAS Institute Inc., 1999). Generally, we seek to model longitudinally&#xD;
      the trajectory of these outcomes as a function of time, intervention group assignment, and&#xD;
      group-by-time interaction. We begin by fitting base models, those with minimum covariates&#xD;
      and, for longitudinal models, the most restricted residual covariance structures. Additional&#xD;
      covariates then will be considered. Similar models will be used to examine the secondary&#xD;
      outcomes of diet, physical activity, and self-management, e.g., BG variability). We will&#xD;
      examine change from baseline for each outcome as the dependent variable. In addition to&#xD;
      testing the groups-by-time interaction term, custom contrasts will assess group differences&#xD;
      at each time point.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mediating &amp; Moderating Analyses. These analyses will further elaborate any observed treatment&#xD;
      effects. A first set will determine whether demographic strata, use of media, and dose&#xD;
      effects moderate any intervention effects. Each outcome will be regressed onto measures of&#xD;
      intervention, baseline covariates and their interactions with intervention group assignment.&#xD;
      A second set of analyses will test specific mediation hypotheses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cost Estimates. To calculate the per-participant costs of each intervention, we will first&#xD;
      adjust all of the costs obtained from project records for inflation to constant US dollars&#xD;
      for the final year of the study using the Bureau of Labor Statistics' Consumer Price Index.&#xD;
      Capital costs will be annualized and discounted at the investment interest rate in the final&#xD;
      year of the program. Fixed costs will be allocated among all participants in each arm, and we&#xD;
      will divide group leader costs by the number of respective participants. After these&#xD;
      adjustments and allocations are completed, the newly calculated per-participant costs will be&#xD;
      combined with any additional costs to compute the total per-participant cost for each&#xD;
      intervention. These cost estimates can be used to project the cost of future dissemination&#xD;
      and implementation efforts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Power Analysis. Sample size and power estimates for comparison of OnTrack and KnowIt in Phase&#xD;
      2 are based on alpha = 0.05 and 2-sided t-tests on change from baseline to 12, 24 and 36&#xD;
      weeks. Estimates of means (SDs) at follow-up from similar studies in type 1 adults (48,&#xD;
      51)and previous experience with REDEEM suggest effect sizes that are small to moderate, with&#xD;
      0.35 to .40 SD unit differences. A sample of 116 participants assigned to OnTrack and to&#xD;
      KnowIt will provide power to exceed 0.80 for tests on the primary outcomes of DD and HbA1c.&#xD;
      This allows detectable mean differences of changes from baseline of magnitude 0.48 for HbA1c.&#xD;
      At the projected sample size for each group, power to discriminate between OnTrack and KnowIt&#xD;
      will be at least 80%. This sample size also will allow us to determine a medium effect size&#xD;
      for the mediation effect (H2) of fear of hypoglycemia with a difference of 15%, and of&#xD;
      self-care behavior with a difference of 17% between the arms. Sample size estimates for&#xD;
      moderator effects (H3) are based upon a group-by-moderator strata interaction test in a&#xD;
      regression model. Findings (48)showed between-group differences on age ranging from of -1.2&#xD;
      to 0.55. Based upon these estimates, the proposed study will be powered to detect the&#xD;
      moderator effect, conditional on the main effects, equal to 0.93. Our preliminary findings&#xD;
      for group by baseline HbA1c interactions and those from the literature suggest power of at&#xD;
      least 0.80.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following screening to assess initial eligibility and interest, a research assistant will&#xD;
      email a baseline survey using Qualtrics with a unique study ID number assigned by the&#xD;
      researcher. The survey begins with the consent form that will be completed electronically.&#xD;
      The research assistant will also email the patient a PDF copy of the consent form and&#xD;
      brochure to assist the patient in fully considering participation, and to retain a copy of&#xD;
      the study consent form to keep for reference.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline assessment (assessment 1): Following informed consent in Qualtrics, participants&#xD;
      will navigate to complete the baseline survey. The survey includes the Type 1 Diabetes&#xD;
      Distress Scale (T1-DDS), plus scales to assess self-management, eating and weight patterns,&#xD;
      medication adherence, mindfulness, problem solving, depression and quality of life. Once&#xD;
      participants complete the survey, their T1-DDS score will be calculated. If this meets our&#xD;
      inclusion threshold (mean score 2.0 and above) participants will be sent a slip for a&#xD;
      baseline blood draw to measure HbA1c and cholesterol levels at a community laboratory (Quest)&#xD;
      of their choosing. Participants whose mean diabetes distress score (measured using the T1-DDS&#xD;
      scale) is below 2.0 will be informed by letter and phone call that they are no longer&#xD;
      eligible. Participants who meet the threshold for severe symptoms of depression (PHQ score 15&#xD;
      and above) will also be informed by letter and phone call from a research assistant, who will&#xD;
      administer a script to encourage the participant to seek help for their symptoms and to&#xD;
      screen for suicide risk.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Laboratory results will be reviewed to determine whether the HbA1c results meet inclusion&#xD;
      criteria (7.5% and above). Participants who meet the HbA1c criteria will be randomized by the&#xD;
      research assistants. Upon completion of baseline assessment participants will be compensated&#xD;
      via gift card (pro-rated for partial baseline completion) for survey completion and for blood&#xD;
      draw.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group workshop (week 0): Participants will be randomly allocated to either OnTrack or KnowIT.&#xD;
      Both programs are the same length and contain the same frequency and types of events, however&#xD;
      the content of each differs and each will be delivered by separate, trained interventionists.&#xD;
      We plan to deliver the workshop to 8-10 participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each workshop will be delivered by a trained interventionist for that workshop. Participants&#xD;
      will have the opportunity to participate in group discussions and share experiences&#xD;
      throughout the workshop to reflect on the material being delivered. During the workshops the&#xD;
      heights, weights and blood pressures of participants (required for baseline characteristic&#xD;
      assessment and the outcome analyses) will be recorded in a private location by one of the&#xD;
      attending members of the study team. Participants in both groups will receive a copy of their&#xD;
      baseline HbA1c result, cholesterol results and blood pressure results. In addition,&#xD;
      participants in the OnTrack group will receive a copy of their diabetes distress score&#xD;
      profile (since diabetes distress is specifically targeted in this intervention arm). At the&#xD;
      end of the workshops, participants in both groups will write a brief Action Plan that allows&#xD;
      participants to develop a series of personal goals to enhance their diabetes management.&#xD;
      Participants in both groups will be given a copy of the workshop content at the end of the&#xD;
      workshops for reference.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group web meetings and individual phone calls (weeks 1- 12): Following the workshop,&#xD;
      participants will receive four 10-15 minute individual phone call from their group&#xD;
      facilitator at one, three, seven and 11 weeks following the initial workshop, at mutually&#xD;
      agreed times. The purpose of the call is to review participant progress with their Action&#xD;
      Plans and to enable participants to discuss any challenges one-on-one with the facilitator.&#xD;
      Participants will also take part in four 65 minute online web group meetings using WebEx, at&#xD;
      two, four, eight and 12 weeks after the workshop. WebEx allows individuals to connect in an&#xD;
      online meeting using video and audio. The purpose of the meetings is to reinforce and build&#xD;
      upon workshop content, and to allow participants to support each other and to raise any&#xD;
      challenges they are experiencing with reaching their Action Plan goals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessment 2 (week 12 / 3 months): Participants will be asked to complete the same survey and&#xD;
      blood draws as they completed at baseline. A research assistant will email a personalized and&#xD;
      confidential link to the survey via Qualtrics, and will mail a lab slip for a blood draw from&#xD;
      a local community laboratory of the participants' preference.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MAINTENTANCE PHASE (WEEKS 13 - 39): Following the workshop, participants will receive two&#xD;
      10-15 minute individual phone call from their group facilitator at 20 and 28 weeks following&#xD;
      the workshop to review their progress with their Action Plans.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessment 3 (week 39 / 9 months): Participants will be asked to complete the same survey and&#xD;
      blood draws as they completed at baseline and assessment 2.&#xD;
