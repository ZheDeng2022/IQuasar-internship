  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main purpose of the study is to evaluate the safety of oral auranofin, a gold compound,&#xD;
      in patients with HIV infection whose viral load has been suppressed by antiretroviral therapy&#xD;
      for no less than 3 years and have a CD4+ cell count over 500 cells/uL&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators proposed a novel approach in order to reduce the HIV viral reservoir. This&#xD;
      approach exploits the effects of auranofin, a gold based compound which has been used in the&#xD;
      treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. Auranofin induces partially selective apoptosis and&#xD;
      differentiation towards short-lived phenotypes of the T lymphocyte memory subsets that&#xD;
      encompass the main viral reservoir in patients. The hypothesis is that the targeted memory&#xD;
      cells would either die or decrease their persistence in the body, with the associated latent&#xD;
      viral reservoir being reduced.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be conducted in two phases: A sequential dose-escalation phase to evaluate two&#xD;
      doses of auranofin, followed by an expansion at the maximum tolerated dose (MTD). A total of&#xD;
      20 patients are to be treated at the MTD. Auranofin treatment is administered for 12 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety and tolerability will be evaluated by repeated laboratory panel and physcial&#xD;
      examination during the 12 weeks of auranofin therapy and 8 for weeks thereafter. The latent&#xD;
      reservoir will be measured by assessment of the inegrated viral DNA in CD4+ cells in the&#xD;
      circulating blood and in gut biopsies.&#xD;
