    <criteria>

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  COPD patients with an forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) &lt;= 65% of&#xD;
             predicted normal and FEV1 &lt;= 70% of forced vital capacity (FVC)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Male or female patients 40 years of age or older.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient must have a smoking history of more than 10 pack-years. A pack-year is defined&#xD;
             as the equivalent of smoking on pack of cigarettes per day for a year.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient must be able to perform pulmonary function test as required in the protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient must be able to inhale medication from the handihaler device and should have a&#xD;
             good technique of inhaling aerosol administered from MDI.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  All patients must sign an informed consent from prior to participation in the trail,&#xD;
             prior to pre-study washout of their usual pulmonary medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient with significant disease other than COPD will be excluded. A significant&#xD;
             disease is defined as a disease which in the opinion of the investigator may either&#xD;
             put the patient at risk because of participation in the study or a disease which may&#xD;
             influence the result of the study or the patient's ability to participate in the&#xD;
             study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with clinically significant abnormal baseline hematology, blood chemistry or&#xD;
             urinalysis, if the abnormality defines a disease listed as an exclusion criterion will&#xD;
             be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  All patients with a serum glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase (SGOT) and serum&#xD;
             glutamic-pyruvic transaminase (SGPT) twice the upper normal limit, bilirubin 150% or&#xD;
             creatinine 125% of the upper normal limit will be excluded regardless of the clinical&#xD;
             condition. Repeat laboratory evaluation will be not be conducted in these subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with a recent history ( i.e. one year or less) of myocardial infarction.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with a recent history ( i.e. one year or less) of heart failure or patients&#xD;
             with any cardiac arrhythmia requiring drug therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with regular use of daytime oxygen therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with known active tuberculosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with a history of cancer within the last five years. Patients with treated&#xD;
             basal cell carcinoma are allowed.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with a history of life-threatening pulmonary, or history of cystic fibrosis&#xD;
             or bronchiectasis.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have undergone pulmonary resection or a thoracotomy for any reason.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with an upper respiratory tract infection in the past 2 weeks prior to the&#xD;
             screening visit (= Visit 1) or during the baseline period of 2-weeks (run-in period).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with known hypersensitivity to anticholinergic drugs, lactose or any other&#xD;
             component of the inhalation capsule delivery system.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with known symptomatic prostatic hypertrophy or bladder neck obstruction.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with known narrow-angle glaucoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who are being treated with cromolyn sodium or nedocromil sodium.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who are being treated with antihistamines.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients using oral corticosteroid medication at unstable dosage (i.e. less than 6&#xD;
             weeks on a stable dose) or at a dose excess of the equivalent 10 mg of prednisone per&#xD;
             day or 20 mg every day.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant or nursing women or women of childbearing potential not using medically&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Patients with a history of asthma, allergic rhinitis or atopy or who have a blood&#xD;
             total eosinophil count &gt;= 400 per microliter (males) or &gt;= 320 per microliter&#xD;
             (females). A repeat eosinophil count will not be conducted in these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with a history and/or active alcohol or drug abuse.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have taken an investigational drug on month or six half-lives (whichever&#xD;
