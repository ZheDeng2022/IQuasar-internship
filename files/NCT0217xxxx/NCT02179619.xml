  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is to verify that Dermalax (Deep) is not inferior to the reference device,&#xD;
      Restylane®, in terms of efficacy and safety in the correction of nasolabial folds. Subjects&#xD;
      who voluntarily signed the informed consent and are judged to be eligible for this study will&#xD;
      be intradermally injected both of study device and comparator device. Subjects will be&#xD;
      randomized to receive injection of study device and comparator device on their each&#xD;
      nasolabial fold. Efficacy is evaluated based on the change in Wrinkle Severity Rating Scale&#xD;
      (WSRS) from baseline. Safety will be assessed based on 24 weeks follow up visits and subject&#xD;
      diary which will be given to subjects during the first 2 weeks after the injection. Any&#xD;
      uncomfortable things and adverse events will be investigated from subject diary and follow up&#xD;
      visits.&#xD;

             the same score on both sides.*)&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
          4. Subjects who have used a local ointment on their faces (medication such as steroid or&#xD;

             prior to screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Subjects who have a permanent skin expander such as soft form or silicon implanted in&#xD;
             the face.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Subjects who have scars on the face requiring a medical treatment but who have not&#xD;
