  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare surgery plus bracing versus bracing alone. Both&#xD;
      groups are considered standard of care treatments. The goal of this study is to determine&#xD;
      which group is a better treatment.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patient must be between 18 and 65 years old and had an acute trauma with an AO type A3 burst&#xD;
      fracture (a spinal injury where one of the bony parts of the spine [vertebra] breaks due to&#xD;
      immediate and severe compression).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to compare surgery plus bracing versus bracing alone. Patients&#xD;
      will be followed for 10 years. The investigators will compare patients' x-ray outcomes and&#xD;
      clinical outcomes (i.e. how a patient is feeling and how a patient is able to do usual daily&#xD;
      activities) as well as patients' immediate and delayed medical and surgical side effects&#xD;
      between the 2 study arms. The goal of this study is to determine if treating patients with&#xD;
      surgery plus bracing is better than just bracing alone.&#xD;
