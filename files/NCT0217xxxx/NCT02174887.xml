  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The prognostic of metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma is dismal and the treatment gold&#xD;
      standard since the end of the 90s' is gemcitabine; unfortunately all trials testing&#xD;
      combinations of gemcitabine with chemotherapeutic agents or targeted agents had failed to&#xD;
      demonstrate any superiority over gemcitabine monotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a recently published phase I/II study of combination of gemcitabine plus nab-paclitaxel in&#xD;
      patients with metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PAC), the combination gave an impressive&#xD;
      response rate of 48% (Gemcitabine 1g/m² and nab-paclitaxel 125 mg/m² once a week for 3 weeks,&#xD;
      every 4 weeks). The safety profile was correct (fatigue, sensory neuropathy, nausea,&#xD;
      haematological side effects). This efficacy can be related to an improvement of gemcitabine&#xD;
      delivery to the tumor bed, as shown on preclinical studies: the response rate in xenografts&#xD;
      was better with the combination; this improvement was associated with an increase of&#xD;
      intratumoral gemcitabine concentration in mice receiving the combination when compared to&#xD;
      mice receiving gemcitabine alone. This might be associated to modifications of peritumoral&#xD;
      stroma with reduction of stromal content and increase in dilated vessels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to evaluate if the combination of nab-paclitaxel plus gemcitabine&#xD;
      induces a modification in vascularization of pancreatic adenocarcinoma on the primary tumor&#xD;
      and of liver metastases after 2 cycles of treatment by comparison to baseline.&#xD;
