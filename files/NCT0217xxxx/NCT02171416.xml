  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cold contact urticaria (CCU) is a frequent form of physical urticaria that is characterized&#xD;
      by the development of wheal and flare type skin reactions due to the release of histamine and&#xD;
      other proinflammatory mast cell mediators following exposure of the skin to cold. Typically,&#xD;
      symptoms occur within minutes after cold contact, including exposure to cold air, liquids or&#xD;
      objects and are limited to cold exposed skin areas.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators postulate that there is an overlap between acquired cold urticaria and&#xD;
      cold-induced autoinflammatory syndromes, and that cold urticaria patients unresponsive to&#xD;
      antihistamines will benefit from IL-1 targeting treatment strategies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will evaluate the efficacy and safety of the IL-1 transfusion protein rilonacept&#xD;
      in patients with cold contact urticaria who could not be successfully treated with first-line&#xD;
      medication such as antihistamines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a double-blind placebo-controlled parallel group phase II study of the efficacy and&#xD;
      safety of rilonacept in subjects with CCU. A total of 20 patients will be included by the&#xD;
      Urticaria specialty clinics of ACC. The total duration of the study course for each patient&#xD;
      is 14 weeks and is divided in:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Screening period (2 weeks, days -14-0)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Placebo-controlled double-blind phase (Part A, 6 weeks, days 0-42)&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Open label phase (Part B, 6 weeks, days 42-84) All eligible patients will be randomized&#xD;
           (1:1 randomization) to one of two groups: 1) Rilonacept 160mg/week or 2) Placebo, and&#xD;
           will receive the respective dose subcutaneously. Following the placebo-controlled&#xD;
           double-blind phase patients will enter the open-label phase and receive rilonacept&#xD;
           open-label treatment (160mg or 320mg depending on treatment response during part A).&#xD;
