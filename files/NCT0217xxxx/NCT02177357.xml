             bradykinesia, resting tremor, postural instability) and without any other known or&#xD;
             Suspected cause for their Parkinsonism&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients on levodopa therapy who show a good response to levodopa and be on a stable&#xD;
             dosage of levodopa for least 1 month prior to study entry&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients able to take oral medication&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must give voluntary written consent for study participation and must sign a&#xD;
             Patient Informed Consent Form at the screening visit, prior to initiation of any&#xD;
             study-related procedures&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Atypical parkinsonian syndromes secondary to drugs (e.g., metoclopramide,&#xD;
             flunarizine), metabolic disorders (e.g., Wilson disease), encephalitis, or&#xD;
             degenerative diseases (e.g., progressive supranuclear palsy, multiple-system atrophy)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Dementia that could impair compliance with medication and/or preclude giving informed&#xD;
             consent (i.e., Mini-Mental Status Examination score ≤22)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of psychosis&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of active epilepsy (e.g., occurrence of a seizure) within 1 year prior to&#xD;
             screening&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Second or third degree atrioventricular block or sick sinus syndrome, resting heart&#xD;
             rate below 50 beats per minute, congestive heart failure (New York Heart Association&#xD;
             functional Class III or IV), myocardial infarction within 6 months of randomization,&#xD;
             or other clinically significant heart conditions (e.g., coronary artery disease) that&#xD;
             might negatively affect the possibility of the patient completing the study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Clinically significant liver disease that may prevent the patient from completing the&#xD;
             study and/or elevation in total bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, lactate dehydrogenase&#xD;
             (LDH), serum glutamate pyruvate transaminase (SGPT), or serum glutamate oxaloacetate&#xD;
             transaminase (SGOT) of &gt;1.5 times the upper limit of the normal values&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Clinically significant renal disease that may prevent the patient from completing the&#xD;
             study and/or elevation in serum creatinine of &gt;1.5 times the upper limit of the normal&#xD;
             values&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Presence of active neoplastic disease&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Surgery within 6 months of the baseline/randomization visit which, in the opinion of&#xD;
             the investigator, might negatively impact the patient's participation in the study, or&#xD;
             any history of stereotaxic brain surgery (e.g., thalamotomy, pallidotomy, or any other&#xD;
             deep brain stimulation for reduction of parkinsonian symptoms)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Supine systolic blood pressure less than 100 mm Hg or evidence of a ≥20-mm Hg decline&#xD;
             in systolic blood pressure at 2 minutes after standing, compared with the previous&#xD;
             supine systolic blood pressure obtained after 5 minutes of quiet rest, if the decline&#xD;
             in blood pressure upon standing is associated with symptoms (i.e., symptomatic&#xD;
             orthostatic hypotension)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Use of dopamine agonist medications (e.g., bromocriptine, pergolide) in the 2 months&#xD;
             prior to study entry (allowed medications: selegiline, anticholinergics, and&#xD;
             amantadine therapy at a stable dosage for 60 days prior to study entry and remaining&#xD;
             stable throughout the study)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Use of neuroleptics, alpha-methyldopa, or flunarizine within the past 6 months&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Use of any of the following drugs within 3 months of study entry: methylphenidate,&#xD;
             cinnarizine, reserpine, amphetamine, and monoamine oxidase-A inhibitors (e.g.,&#xD;
             pargyline, phenelzine, or tranylcypromine)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Use of pramipexole within the past 3 months or a history of adverse reaction or&#xD;
             allergy to pramipexole&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Unstable dosage of centrally active therapies (e.g., hypnotics, antidepressants,&#xD;
             anxiolytics) within the past 60 days&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Electroconvulsive therapy within 90 days of the baseline/randomization visit&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participation in other investigational drug studies or receipt of other&#xD;
             investigational drugs within 30 days prior to baseline/randomization. Investigational&#xD;
             drugs for Parkinson disease must have been discontinued for 90 days prior to&#xD;
             baseline/randomization. Additionally, patients previously randomized into this study&#xD;
             and who then discontinued study participation are not to be re-entered into the study&#xD;
