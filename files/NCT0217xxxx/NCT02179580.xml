      Ministry of Health and Welfare Department of Chinese Medicine and pharmacy specially&#xD;
      subsidizes domestic teaching hospitals to install clinical study centers for Chinese&#xD;
      pharmacies, in order to establish the clinical study environment for Chinese pharmacies&#xD;
      meeting the international regulations, to assist promoting and performing clinical studies in&#xD;
      Chinese pharmacies, and then to improve the nation's health and benefits. This will render&#xD;
      Chinese pharmacies competitive in the international market by employing scientific tests and&#xD;
      verifications. The new project applications are respectively as follows: A randomized double&#xD;
      blind placebo control study of Xiang-Sha-Liu-Jun-Zi-Tang (XSLJZT) in patients with irritable&#xD;
      bowel syndrome The main clinical manifestations of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) are&#xD;
      chronic, recurrent abdominal pain or abdominal dyscomfortable associated with the changes of&#xD;
      defecation habit, such as constipation and/or diarrhea. Clinical treatment of IBS includes&#xD;
      behavioral, and drug treatment, such as anti-diarrheal agent, 5-HT3 receptor antagonist and&#xD;
      5-HT4 receptor agonist, but these treatments relieve partial symptoms only.&#xD;
      Xiang-Sha-Liu-Jun-Zi-Tang (XSLJZT) origins from Yizongjinjion, and that uses XSLJZT to treat&#xD;
      the patients who has qi deficiency, phlegm-retained fluid, nausea and vomiting,&#xD;
      gastrointestinal dysharmony and producing many symptoms. These symptoms of mentioned-above&#xD;
      are similar to IBS. Therefore, the purpose of the present study was to investigate the&#xD;
      therapeutic effect of XSLJZT on IBS, the investigators designed a randomized double blind&#xD;
      placebo control study to assess the effect of XSLJZT on IBS.&#xD;

      therapeutic effect of XSLJZT on IBS, we designed a randomized double blind placebo control&#xD;
      study to assess the effect of XSLJZT on IBS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to the performance of the clinical study projects for Chinese pharmacies, our&#xD;
      center will still maintain cooperation with domestic or foreign biotechnology industries, the&#xD;
      industries of Chinese herbal medicine and academic research institutes, such as the material&#xD;
      research institute in Industrial Technology Research Institute, Feng Chia University, and&#xD;
      Yuanpei University, make efforts in expanding the study in the development of novel Chinese&#xD;
      medicinal drugs and novel medical techniques, and cooperate with famous international&#xD;
      Contract Research Organizations (CRO). We want to build a clinical study service platform, in&#xD;
      which the internal part is to integrate various R&amp;D units on campuses and hospitals, such as&#xD;
      the teams in the department of medical care, department of medical technology, all&#xD;
      laboratories, the incubation center, the biostatistics center, the administrative department&#xD;
      and improve the internal procedures for performing clinical studies. The external part is to&#xD;
      make efforts to win over domestic and foreign clinical study cases to be performed in our&#xD;
      center. The performing methods are illustrated as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Setting up the environment and related equipment that enable the performance of clinical&#xD;
           studies in Chinese pharmacies and establishing the operation manuals and standard&#xD;
           operation procedures for performing the R&amp;D stage for drugs of Chinese pharmacies.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Employing professionals required in the clinical study in Chinese pharmacies and&#xD;
           encouraging doctors, pharmacists and nurses to attend advanced study and receive&#xD;
           training while enhancing the incubation for the required professionals of clinical&#xD;
           studies, such that the experience can be passed to others.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Practically performing one or more proposals of developing new drugs of Chinese&#xD;
           pharmacies or the clinical study proposal of reassessing therapeutic efficacies of drugs&#xD;
           in the drug permission certificates issued by the Committee on Chinese Medicine and&#xD;
           Pharmacy on record.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Promoting and building an intact and strong audit system in accordance with Good&#xD;
           Clinical Practice (GCP), elevating the clinical study level in our country, and putting&#xD;
           the regulations of GLP into practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Promoting the cooperation with industries, academics, and governments and international&#xD;
           cooperation.&#xD;
