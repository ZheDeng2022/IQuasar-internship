      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Vitamin A is of utmost importance for health and survival of children. A recent series in The&#xD;
      Lancet on maternal and child health put vitamin A deficiency at the top of most important&#xD;
      micronutrient deficiencies, responsible for more than 600.000 child deaths/year worldwide.&#xD;
      Vitamin A status of mothers and infants is closely linked. Hence, a mother with vitamin A&#xD;
      deficiency cannot give enough vitamin A to her fetus to build stores during the last months&#xD;
      of pregnancy, and will also have insufficient amounts of vitamin A in her breast milk,&#xD;
      resulting in a high risk for vitamin A deficiency in her newborn infant. The World Health&#xD;
      Organization (WHO) has implemented several strategies to fight vitamin A deficiency in&#xD;
      mothers and children. One of these is to give women after delivery a high dose vitamin A&#xD;
      supplement, to improve vitamin A status of mother and, via breast milk, her infant.&#xD;
      Surprisingly however, several recent studies investigating the effect of a high dose vitamin&#xD;
      A supplement for mothers directly after birth found no effect on vitamin A status in infants&#xD;
      6 months of age. In contrast, earlier studies in Bangladesh and Indonesia, in which women&#xD;
      received a high dose vitamin A supplement somewhere in the first 6 weeks after delivery,&#xD;
      reported a large impact on vitamin A status in the infants at 6 mo of age. The WHO&#xD;
      recommendation on post-partum vitamin A supplementation was based on these earlier studies&#xD;
      from Bangladesh and Indonesia. The more recent studies suggest however that this intervention&#xD;
      is not effective, and that millions of women currently receive a high dose vitamin A&#xD;
      supplement without clear benefits for vitamin A status in either the women or their children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The human body reacts to infection or injury with an inflammatory response, which kicks off&#xD;
      with the acute phase response. The acute phase response helps the body to fight the&#xD;
      infection. It is characterized by many altered physiological processes, including changed&#xD;
      availability of vitamins and minerals. Recently, we found that delivery in itself causes a&#xD;
      major acute phase response. We have formed the hypothesis that the acute phase response&#xD;
      initiated by delivery prevents the high dose vitamin A supplement given to the mother&#xD;
      directly after delivery from being absorbed and from being available for breast milk. If this&#xD;
      is true, the current WHO recommendation to give the vitamin A within the first 6 weeks&#xD;
      post-partum should be changed to giving the vitamin A 4 - 6 weeks post-partum instead, to&#xD;
      allow the acute phase response induced by delivery to fade.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective(s) and Hypothesis(es):&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective is to improve the effectiveness of the current WHO policy of vitamin A&#xD;
      supplementation after delivery to improve vitamin A status and health of mothers and their&#xD;
      infants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial, 400 women will receive a high dose&#xD;
      of vitamin A (200.000 IU) within 6 weeks of delivery, as recommended by WHO. Half of the&#xD;
      women will receive the vitamin A directly after delivery (within 3 days, current practice),&#xD;
      whereas the other women will receive the vitamin A 6 weeks after delivery. To guarantee&#xD;
      blinding, women will receive a placebo capsule if they are not receiving a vitamin A capsule.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main outcomes will be maternal and infant vitamin A status 6 months post-partum and the&#xD;
      time-course of the acute phase response, to establish the optimal time after delivery for the&#xD;
      initiation of the vitamin A supplementation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcomes will be the morbidity of the infants during the first 6 months of life and&#xD;
      growth performance of the infants at 6 mo of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Potential Impact:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The results of this study will enable WHO to improve the effectiveness of the current WHO&#xD;
      recommendations concerning post-partum vitamin A supplementation. If our hypothesis is true,&#xD;
      postponing the timing of the post-partum vitamin A supplement from directly after delivery to&#xD;
      6 week post-partum, will significantly increased the availability of the supplement for the&#xD;
      mother. This will increase the vitamin A status of both mother and infant. Moreover, there&#xD;
      are several significant implications for global health policies, with important consequences&#xD;
      for infant survival worldwide by reducing morbidity and mortality from infectious diseases&#xD;
      during the first 6 months of life. Results of the study will also have important consequences&#xD;
      for other micronutrient health programs, such as vitamin A supplementation for children above&#xD;
      6 months of age and iron supplementation in areas with endemic malaria, as these are also&#xD;
      subject to the effects of the acute phase response&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Background. Undernutrition causes over 3.5 million child deaths a year, with vitamin A&#xD;
      deficiency alone responsible for almost 0.6 million child deaths per year1. Vitamin A&#xD;
      supplementation of children above 6 months of age has been shown to reduce overall mortality&#xD;
      by 23%. The effect of vitamin A supplementation in newborns on morbidity and mortality is&#xD;
      less clear, with three studies in India, Indonesia and Nepal showing reductions in neonatal&#xD;
      mortality of 22%, 64% and 15% respectively, but with 2 other trials in Africa reporting no&#xD;
      effect. In view of the expected health benefits of improved vitamin A status of infants, WHO&#xD;
      currently recommends that women should receive a high dose (200.000 IU ) of vitamin A within&#xD;
      the first 6 weeks postpartum, in order to improve maternal vitamin A status, the vitamin A&#xD;
      content of breast milk, and thereby the vitamin A status of their infants. However, several&#xD;
      recent trials in which women received 200.000 IU vitamin A directly post-partum, reported no&#xD;
      improvement in vitamin A status of either mother or her infant at 6 mo of age, not even after&#xD;
      doubling the dose to 400.000 IU. In these studies vitamin A was given within a week of&#xD;
      delivery, the current typical practice even though WHO actually states a window of 6 weeks&#xD;
      after delivery. In contrast, 2 earlier studies in Bangladesh and Indonesia reported a large&#xD;
      impact of post-partum maternal supplementation on vitamin A status in infants at 6 mo of age.&#xD;
      In these studies, women received a high dose vitamin A supplement not directly post-partum,&#xD;
      but somewhere in the first 6 weeks after delivery. The WHO recommendation on maternal&#xD;
      post-partum vitamin A supplementation was based on the effects observed in these earlier&#xD;
      studies, but the more recent studies suggest now that this intervention is not effective, and&#xD;
      that millions of women are receiving a high dose vitamin A supplement without clear benefits&#xD;
      for vitamin A status of either the women or their children. The difference in timing between&#xD;
      the earlier studies and the recent studies of giving the vitamin A may hold the key, and we&#xD;
      believe we have identified the biological reason why timing of the supplementation could be&#xD;
      of the utmost importance: the inflammatory response to delivery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Delivery induces a considerable physiological inflammatory response, with a distinct acute&#xD;
      phase response, of the same magnitude as seen for instance in pulmonary tuberculosis&#xD;
      patients. We believe that the lack of effect of the current practice of giving a high dose&#xD;
      vitamin A supplement directly post-partum is due to the acute phase response induced by the&#xD;
      delivery, and that the intervention would be successful if the supplementation was given&#xD;
      after the acute phase response has faded away after 3 - 6 weeks. There is currently no data&#xD;
      available on the vitamin A bioavailability in lactating women, but a study in Zambian&#xD;
      pre-school children investigated the effectiveness of a high dose vitamin A supplementation&#xD;
      campaign in children, and showed that this was only successful in children without&#xD;
      inflammation. Children who had signs of inflammation had no increase in vitamin A status.&#xD;
      Inflammation and the accompanying acute phase response are also known to affect the&#xD;
      availability of other micronutrients besides vitamin A, such as iron and zinc.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective(s) and Hypothesis(es):&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis The acute phase response (APR) induced by delivery reduces vitamin A&#xD;
      bioavailability, and interferes with current maternal post-partum high dose vitamin A&#xD;
      supplementation programs worldwide.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective 1 To determine the effects of the acute phase response on vitamin A&#xD;
      bioavailability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective 2 To determine the time course of the acute phase response after delivery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Overall goal To improve the effectiveness of the current WHO recommendation of post-partum&#xD;
      maternal high dose vitamin A supplementation by determining the optimal timing for&#xD;
      supplementation in relation to the post-partum APR.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design and Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A randomised, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial in 400 women, comparing the effects of&#xD;
      the recommended dose of 200.000 IU of vitamin A given within the first week post-partum&#xD;
      (current practice, 200 women) with the effect when given at 6 weeks post-partum, which is&#xD;
      still within the WHO recommended intervention window (200 women). Main outcomes will be&#xD;
      maternal and infant vitamin A status 6 months post-partum, breast milk vitamin A&#xD;
      concentrations and the time-course of acute phase response, to establish the optimal time&#xD;
      after delivery for vitamin A supplementation. Secondary outcomes will be morbidity of the&#xD;
      infants during the first 6 months of life and anthropometrical indices of the infants at 6 mo&#xD;
      of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Potential Impact:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If our hypothesis is true, the current global health strategy of postpartum vitamin A&#xD;
      supplementation to improve vitamin A status of mothers and infants can be made effective just&#xD;
      by changing the timing. This will have significant implications for global health policies,&#xD;
      with important consequences for infant survival worldwide by improving vitamin A status and&#xD;
      reducing morbidity and mortality from infectious diseases during the first 6 months of life.&#xD;
      Moreover, results of the study will have important consequences for other micronutrient&#xD;
      health programs, such as vitamin A supplementation for children above 6 months of age and&#xD;
      iron or zinc supplementation programs, as these are also affected by the acute phase&#xD;
      response. Overall, the results of this research will contribute to improving child survival&#xD;
      worldwide.&#xD;
