      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as gemcitabine hydrochloride and carboplatin,&#xD;
      work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by&#xD;
      stopping them from dividing. Monoclonal antibodies, such as MK-0646, can block tumor growth&#xD;
      in different ways. Some block the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Others find&#xD;
      tumor cells and help kill them or carry tumor-killing substances to them. It is not yet known&#xD;
      whether gemcitabine hydrochloride and carboplatin are more effective when given together with&#xD;
      or without MK-0646 in treating patients with non-small cell lung cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE: This randomized phase II trial is studying how well gemcitabine hydrochloride and&#xD;
      carboplatin work when given together with or without MK-0646 as first-line therapy in&#xD;
      treating patients with stage IIIB or stage IV non-small cell lung cancer.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess and compare the progression-free survival of patients with stage IIIB or IV&#xD;
           squamous cell non-small cell lung cancer treated with gemcitabine hydrochloride and&#xD;
           carboplatin with vs without MK-0646 as first-line therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess and compare the objective tumor response rate in patients treated with these&#xD;
           regimens.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess and compare the duration of response in patients with objective tumor response&#xD;
           treated with these regimens.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess and compare the time to progression and time to treatment failure in patients&#xD;
           treated with these regimens.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess and compare the 1-year overall survival of patients treated with these&#xD;
           regimens.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess and compare the clinical toxicities of these regimens in these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To compare the quality of life of patients treated with these regimens.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tertiary&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To collect blood and tumor specimens for future evaluation of pharmacogenetic and&#xD;
           proteomic markers of tumor response and toxicity to therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the relationship between ht-SNPs in genes that mediate&#xD;
           chemosensitivity/resistance to gemcitabine hydrochloride (e.g. ribonucleotide reductase)&#xD;
           and IGF1R pathway genes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To bank paraffin-embedded tissue blocks/slides for future histochemistry evaluation and&#xD;
           DNA extraction as part of ongoing research for NCCTG lung studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to prior adjuvant&#xD;
      therapy, neoadjuvant therapy, or chemoradiotherapy (yes vs no), and ECOG performance status&#xD;
      (0 vs 1 vs 2). Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Arm I: Patients receive gemcitabine hydrochloride IV over 30 minutes on days 1 and 8,&#xD;
           carboplatin IV over 30 minutes on day 1, and MK-0646 IV over 60 minutes on days 1, 8,&#xD;
           and 15. Treatment repeats every 21 days for 4 courses in the absence of disease&#xD;
           progression or unacceptable toxicity. After 4 courses, patients with stable disease or&#xD;
           partial or complete response may then receive MK-0646 alone on days 1 and 15. Treatment&#xD;
           with MK-0646 repeats every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable&#xD;
           toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Arm II: Patients receive gemcitabine hydrochloride and carboplatin as in arm I.&#xD;
           Treatment repeats every 21 days for 4 courses in the absence of disease progression or&#xD;
           unacceptable toxicity. Patients may crossover to arm I upon disease progression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood and tissue samples may be collected for pharmacogenetics and further laboratory&#xD;
      analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Quality of life is assessed at baseline and periodically during study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up periodically for up to 5 years.&#xD;
