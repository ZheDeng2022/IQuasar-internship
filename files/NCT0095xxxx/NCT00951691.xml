  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will develop and test a new program of enhanced medical rehabilitation for elderly&#xD;
      people who have had an acute disabling medical event and are admitted to a skilled nursing&#xD;
      facility for post-acute rehabilitation.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Disabling medical events are common for elderly people, causing immobilization, requiring&#xD;
      extensive rehabilitation, and generating fears of loss of function and need for&#xD;
      institutionalization. Existing acute medical rehabilitation settings-skilled nursing&#xD;
      facilities (SNFs) and inpatient rehabilitation facilities (IRFs)-often do not adequately meet&#xD;
      the needs of depressed elders, resulting in a missed opportunity for effective and functional&#xD;
      recovery. This study will test a new program that will enhance acute rehabilitation in SNFs&#xD;
      to target mood, motivation, and functional recovery in the 2 to 4 weeks after&#xD;
      hospitalization. This program, developed by the research team, increases the intensity and&#xD;
      engagement of physical therapy (PT) and occupational therapy (OT).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participation in this study will last until discharge from the SNF, with follow-up&#xD;
      assessments lasting until 3 months after entry. Participants will be randomly assigned to&#xD;
      receive either the enhanced acute medical rehabilitation or treatment as usual. Participants&#xD;
      receiving the enhanced care will complete up to 3 hours of enhanced PT and OT per day from&#xD;
      study entry until discharge, excluding weekends. Participants receiving treatment as usual&#xD;
      will receive standard PT and OT. Study assessments will take place at baseline, after 8 and&#xD;
      15 days, and after discharge. Follow-up assessments will occur after 30, 60, and 90 days.&#xD;
      Assessments will include questionnaires and interviews measuring positive and negative&#xD;
      affect, and functional impairment and disability.&#xD;
