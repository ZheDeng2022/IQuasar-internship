      An enteral diet supplemented with ginger extract in acute respiratory distress syndrome&#xD;
      (ARDS) patients may be beneficial for gas exchange and could decrease duration of mechanical&#xD;
      ventilation and length of stay in intensive care unit (ICU).&#xD;

      Rationale: Clinical ARDS occurs primarily as the result of inflammatory injury to the alveoli&#xD;
      producing diffuse alveolar damage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: To evaluate the effects of an enteral diet enriched with ginger extract on&#xD;
      inflammatory factors, respiratory profile and outcome of patients with ARDS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: In this single center, randomized, controlled double blind study, 32 patients with&#xD;
      ARDS were randomized to receive a high protein enteral diet enriched with ginger extract or&#xD;
      placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measurements and Main Results: Serum levels of IL-1, IL-6, TNF-α and LTB-4, oxygenation,&#xD;
      measured as PaO2/FiO2, static compliance measured on days 0, 5 and 10.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients fed enteral diet enriched with ginger extract had significantly lower serum levels&#xD;
      of IL-1, IL-6, TNF-α and LTB-4 on days 5 and 10 compared to control group (P&lt;0.05).&#xD;
      Significant improvement in oxygenation was observed on day 5 (P=0.02) and 10 (P=0.003) in&#xD;
      ginger extract group compared to control group. Static compliance was also increased&#xD;
      significantly on day 5 (P=0.01) in ginger extract group compared to control group. A&#xD;
      significant difference was found in duration of mechanical ventilation (P0.02) and length of&#xD;
      ICU stay (P=0.04) in favor of ginger extract group. We did not find any difference in&#xD;
      barotraumas, organ failure and mortality between the study groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Conclusions: An enteral diet supplemented with ginger extract in ARDS patients may be&#xD;
      beneficial for gas exchange and could decrease duration of mechanical ventilation and length&#xD;
      of stay in ICU.&#xD;
