  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients have a type of cancer called nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) that has either come&#xD;
      back or not gone away after the best known standard treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Most patients that respond to chemotherapy once their NPC tumors have come back have been&#xD;
      treated with a platinum-based medication like cisplatin. However, since many patients are&#xD;
      given cisplatin during their initial treatment for NPC, in this study, they will be treated&#xD;
      with another platinum-based chemotherapy medicine that has been used in patients with NPC&#xD;
      called carboplatin. In this study, carboplatin will be used in combination with another drug&#xD;
      called docetaxel. Other studies in patients with advanced head and neck cancer have shown&#xD;
      that docetaxel can cause tumors to respond better and allow patients to survive longer when&#xD;
      added to the standard treatments for those diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Some patients with NPC show evidence of infection with the virus that causes infectious&#xD;
      mononucleosis, known as the Epstein Barr virus (EBV), before or at the time of their cancer&#xD;
      diagnosis. EBV is found in the cancer cells of almost all patients with advanced stage&#xD;
      disease, suggesting that it may play a role in causing NPC. Previously, patients have been&#xD;
      treated with high-risk NPC using EBV-specific cytotoxic T cells. These cells are grown in the&#xD;
      laboratory and taught to recognize and attack EBV infected cells. In the past, patients were&#xD;
      either given the cells alone or just after they had received a medication to briefly lower&#xD;
      their white blood cell count. In both cases, many patients had their tumors shrink and in&#xD;
      some cases completely disappear after being treated with these EBV-specific cytotoxic T&#xD;
      cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators have now decided to look at how patients with NPC and their tumors respond to&#xD;
      the treatment combination of chemotherapy and EBV-CTL. Patients are being asked to&#xD;
      participate in this study since the NPC tumor is associated with EBV and has either come back&#xD;
      or not responded to standard treatment. This combination of chemotherapy and EBV-CTLs is an&#xD;
      investigational treatment not approved by the Food and Drug Administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to see how relapsed or refractory, EBV-associated NPC tumors&#xD;
      respond when treated with carboplatin and docetaxel followed by EBV-CTL.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A blood sample will be obtained to start making the CTLs before the patient begins&#xD;
      chemotherapy. The patients EBV-specific T cells will be grown while the patient is being&#xD;
      treated with chemotherapy and given back to the patient after their chemotherapy is&#xD;
      completed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To prepare the CTLs, 60-70 cc of blood will be taken from the patient. The amount of blood&#xD;
      collected depends on their size and weight, no more than 3 cc of blood per kg of body weight&#xD;
      will be collected at any one time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This blood will be used to grow an EBV-infected B-cell line and then a T-cell line. B cells&#xD;
      and T cells are types of white blood cells that help fight infections in the body. After&#xD;
      growing T cells in the laboratory, these cells will be stimulated with EBV infected B cells.&#xD;
      The B cells have been treated with radiation so they cannot grow; however, they can provide&#xD;
      the stimulation that will train the T cells to recognize and kill EBV infected cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The generation of EBV-CTL requires the use of a special cell line, called lymphoblastoid cell&#xD;
      line, which will be made from the blood by infecting cells with EBV. Once the LCLs are made,&#xD;
      the T cells will be repeatedly stimulate with the LCLs to make EBV-CTL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The CTLs will then be tested to make sure they kill the EBV infected cells before they are&#xD;
      given back to the patient. If the number of CTLs produced is low, investigators may need to&#xD;
      obtain additional blood samples to make these cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Because the patients cells are being grown in the laboratory, blood will have to be taken to&#xD;
      test for infectious viruses such as hepatitis and HIV and patients will also have to fill in&#xD;
      a questionnaire that is given to standard blood donors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPECTED LENGTH OF STUDY The chemotherapy treatment portion is planned as 4 cycles of&#xD;
      chemotherapy given every 3 weeks. Up to an additional 2 cycles of chemotherapy may be given&#xD;
      if the EBV-CTL product is not available after the initial 4 cycles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the patient has been able to complete at least 4 cycles of chemotherapy and the EBV-CTL&#xD;
      are ready for infusion,then the cells will be given back to the patient. The infusion of the&#xD;
      T cells will last about 1 to 5 minutes after the patient has been pretreated with one dose of&#xD;
      Tylenol and Benadryl.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patient will have another disease re-evaluation 8 weeks after the first EBV-CTL&#xD;
      injection. Based upon the patient's response to the first infusion, the patient may receive&#xD;
      extra doses of cells if they are available. These would be given every 1.5-3 months. If the&#xD;
      patient has additional injections of cells, this will require an additional disease&#xD;
      re-evaluation 8 weeks after each infusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To learn more about the way the EBV-CTLS are working and how long they last in the body,&#xD;
      10-60 mls of blood will be taken before and after each infusion. Up to 60 ml of blood will&#xD;
      also be drawn before each cycle of chemotherapy that occurs at Week 1, Week 4, Week 7, Week&#xD;
      10 before the T cell infusion and then at Weeks 1, 2, 4, 6 and 8 weeks after infusion, and&#xD;
      then again at the follow-up visits 5, 8, and 11-12 months after infusion. This blood will be&#xD;
      used to look at the immune response to the patient's cancer. If the patient only has one&#xD;
      EBV-CTL infusion, up to 108 teaspoons of blood will be drawn to allow for evaluation of his&#xD;
      or her response to treatment; however, the total amount of blood collected on this study will&#xD;
      depend on the total number of EBV-CTL infusions that the patient has.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patient and his/her response to therapy will be followed for at least 1 year after&#xD;
      treatment on this study ends.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY TREATMENT While the cells are being grown, the patient will be started on chemotherapy&#xD;
      in order to shrink the size and/or amount of his/her tumor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patient will be treated with a combination of docetaxel and carboplatin chemotherapy. The&#xD;
      chemotherapy will be given outpatient over several hours. Docetaxel can cause the body to&#xD;
      hold on to extra fluid (fluid retention). This side effect can be prevented in most people if&#xD;
      they take a small steroid dose before and after docetaxel is given. Therefore, the night&#xD;
      before and on the morning chemotherapy is to start, the patient will take a steroid called&#xD;
      dexamethasone by mouth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once the patient gets to clinic, he/she will be given a dose of docetaxel and then a dose of&#xD;
      carboplatin. Each of these medications will be given into the vein after an IV is placed or&#xD;
      into the central line. The patient will then take the last dose of dexamethasone before going&#xD;
      to bed that night. The patient will receive chemotherapy treatment once every 21 days as long&#xD;
      as the patient's blood counts and laboratory tests have returned to an acceptable level. The&#xD;
      patient will have a re-evaluation of his/her disease with imaging scans and laboratory tests&#xD;
      after the second round of chemotherapy. If the patient's tumor has not gotten worse and/or&#xD;
      has not had severe side effects from the chemotherapy, the patient will be treated with 2 to&#xD;
      4 additional rounds of chemotherapy while we are waiting for the EBV-CTLs to be finished.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The combination of chemotherapy agents used in this study might cause the patient's white&#xD;
      blood cells to be low. If they are low for a long period of time or the patient develop a&#xD;
      serious infection while they are low, her/she may be given an extra medication called&#xD;
      Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (GCSF). GCSF helps to stimulate the production of white&#xD;
      blood cells. However, it is anticipated that most people on the study will not require GCSF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once the EBV-CTLs are ready and the patient has recovered from the last round of&#xD;
      chemotherapy, the EBV-CTL infusion will be scheduled. The CTL infusion will take place at&#xD;
      either Houston Methodist Hospital or Texas Children's Hospital. The CTL infusion takes about&#xD;
      1 to 5 minutes, but patients are typically monitored for up to 4 hours after the infusion to&#xD;
      make sure that he/she does not have a reaction to the cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      END OF TREATMENT AND FOLLOW-UP&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patient will have a number of tests and procedures as part of follow up to treatment.&#xD;
      These tests will be used to watch for improvements in tumor size, monitor for side effects&#xD;
      from the treatment, evaluate how the T cells are working, and look for any signs that the&#xD;
      cancer has come back. The patient's will have a physical exam and standard lab tests,&#xD;
      including blood tests, and imaging studies about every 3 months during the first year after&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;

    <description>The overall response rate for patients with advanced-stage, relapsed/refractory, EBV positive nasopharyngeal carcinoma after re-induction chemotherapy (treatment with docetaxel and carboplatin) followed by immunotherapy with EBV-specific Cytotoxic T lymphocytes will be measured. Response rates will be estimated as the percent of patients whose best response is a CR or PR, and a 95% confidence interval will be calculated for the fraction of responses obtained.To measure the overall response rate, disease will be determined by imaging (MRI, CT, and/or PET imaging) 8 weeks after immunotherapy. In addition, per standard of care, disease re-evaluation will continue 3 months during the first year after participation and then as clinically indicated per the patient's primary oncologist.</description>
