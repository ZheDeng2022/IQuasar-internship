      The goal of this study is to find a safe dose of sirolimus that can be used with a standard&#xD;
      dose of L-asparaginase. To find the safe dose, the investigators will give the first patient&#xD;
      a very small dose of sirolimus (smaller than the dose used in organ transplant children) and&#xD;
      the standard dose of L-asparaginase. The investigators will then look for side effects. If&#xD;
      side effects develop, the investigators will decrease the dose of sirolimus. If they do not,&#xD;
      the investigators will increase the dose of sirolimus in the next patient on the study. The&#xD;
      investigators will continue this method until fewer than one-third of patients have a side&#xD;
      effect that would require stopping the drug or changing the dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators plan to enroll up to 15 children with relapsed ALL. The enrolled patients&#xD;
      must have recovered from other treatment before starting this study. Also, they cannot have&#xD;
      severe side effects from their earlier therapy that will possibly make these drugs less safe.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will collect information on whether these drugs help to cure the ALL, but&#xD;
      the purpose will be to find a dose of sirolimus that does not cause too many side effects&#xD;
      when combined with L-asparaginase. This will be explained to the families and they will sign&#xD;
      a written consent. The patients will provide either verbal or written assent when&#xD;
      appropriate.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Multiple relapsed acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) has a very poor cure rate, and there is&#xD;
      no standard of care for treatment of these patients. Therefore, we want to combine two&#xD;
      chemotherapy drugs to see if they are safe and will help treat these patients. The first&#xD;
      agent, L-asparaginase, is used in most patients during their initial treatment for ALL. The&#xD;
      second agent, sirolimus, causes death in human leukemia cells in the laboratory. Sirolimus is&#xD;
      also used in children who have received kidney or heart transplants to prevent organ&#xD;
      rejection. Therefore, the safety and side effects are well known in children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are many steps that allow cancer cells to grow in humans. L-asparaginase and sirolimus&#xD;
      block two different steps in cell growth. Because of this, we anticipate that these two drugs&#xD;
      will work together to lead to more cancer cell death.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first part of the study will last 1 month for each patient. If the patients have a good&#xD;
      response to these two drugs, they will be allowed to continue these drugs for up to 12&#xD;
      months. They will continue on the dose of sirolimus that they received during the first month&#xD;
      for the remaining time on the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will also look at the way leukemia cells are responding to these medications in the&#xD;
      laboratory. We will not draw any blood or bone marrow samples from the patient unless they&#xD;
      already need the procedure done for other tests. The amount of extra blood or bone marrow&#xD;
      drawn will not cause the patients any harm. As we do not know what these laboratory tests&#xD;
      mean, we will not tell the patients the results during the study.&#xD;
