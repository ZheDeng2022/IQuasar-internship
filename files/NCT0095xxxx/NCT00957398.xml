  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The hypothesis of the study is that the motility of the small intestine and the colon will&#xD;
      alter according to the subtype of the irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IBS is currently classified into following subtypes:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Diarrhoea-IBS (IBS-D)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Constipation-IBS (IBS-C)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Mixed-IBS (IBS-M)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Unsubtyped-IBS (IBS-U)&#xD;
&#xD;
      according to the Bristol scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Magnetic Tracking System (MTS) is a new minimal invasive technic that allows motility studies&#xD;
      of the whole human gastrointestinal tract.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The magnetic cylindrical pill (6x15mm) is swallowed at 9 AM on day one. The recording is made&#xD;
      until 4 PM and again from 8 AM until 2 PM on day two. The patient is placed in a bed and will&#xD;
      be supplied with standardized food and fluid.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Magnetic Tracking System consists of a 4 x 4 matrix of sensors positioned with respect to&#xD;
      the anatomical reference points. Before measurements, the matrix is calibrated by offsetting&#xD;
      the earth's and environmental magnetic fields. During the experiment, the magnet coordinates&#xD;
      are continuously monitored and transmitted to a computer for processing and storage.&#xD;
      Respiratory artifacts will be filtered out. Digestive movements will then be classified as 1)&#xD;
      non-propulsive or 2) propulsive and transformed into either trajectory or dynamic graphs of&#xD;
      the digestive motility.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Magnetic Tracking System has the advantage from both radiographic and scintigraphic&#xD;
      methods of conducting the tests without any radiation exposure to the patient. Preliminary&#xD;
      studies have shown good concordance between the transit measured with the magnet and&#xD;
      radiographic transit times.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators wish to use this method, MTS, to compare the motility of the small&#xD;
      intestine and the colon in patients with IBS-D and IBS-C as well as to compare these to&#xD;
      groups to MTS done on healthy volunteers under the same conditions as the IBS patients.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      A MTS study on healthy volunteers is all ready done under the same conditions as described&#xD;
      abow in Denmark. This study has projectID 20080037 and is approved by the Danish&#xD;
      Dataprotection Agency as well as The Regional Committee on Biomedical Research Ethics.&#xD;
