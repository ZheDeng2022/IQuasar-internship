  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study aimed to investigate the short-term efficacy and long-term prognosis of liver&#xD;
      failure patients caused by hepatitis B after single transplantation with autologous marrow&#xD;
      mesenchymal stem cells (MMSCs). Liver failure inpatients caused by hepatitis B were recruited&#xD;
      and received the same medical treatments, among whom some patients underwent single&#xD;
      transplantation with autologous MMSCs and other patients with matched age, gender and&#xD;
      biochemical indexes [alanine aminotransferase (ALT), albumin (ALB), total bilirubin (TBIL),&#xD;
      prothrombin time (PT) and Model for End-stage Liver Disease (MELD) ] were in control group. A&#xD;
      total of 120 ml bone marrow were obtained from patients, diluted and separated. Then MMSCs&#xD;
      suspension were slowly transfused into the liver through the proper hepatic artery by&#xD;
      interventional procedures. The levels of ALB, TBIL, PT and MELD score of patients in&#xD;
      translation group were compared with those in control group. In 3 ~ 48 months of follow-up,&#xD;
      differences in long-term outcomes such as incidence of HCC (hepatocellular carcinoma) and&#xD;
      mortality between two groups were compared.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A total of 527 patients with chronic hepatitis B induced liver failure were recruited from&#xD;
      May 2005 to June 2009 from our department. The diagnoses of chronic hepatitis B and liver&#xD;
      failure were based on previously described criteria. All patients received the same medical&#xD;
      treatments (reducibility glutathione, glycyrrhizin, ademetionine, polyene&#xD;
      phosphatidylcholine, alprostadil, and human serum albumin). Informed consent was obtained&#xD;
      before study. Among these patients, 53 received transplantation with autologous MMSCs. The&#xD;
      day of surgery served as the first day of observation. And 105 patients with matched age,&#xD;
      gender and some biochemical indexes (ALT, ALB, TBIL, PT and MELD ) were served as controls.&#xD;
