&#xD;
          5. Subjects who have been receiving ICS 400mcg/day of FP equivalent for at least 8 weeks&#xD;
             prior to Visit 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  For entry into the treatment period (Visit 2)&#xD;
&#xD;
        A subject will be considered eligible for entering the treatment period only if he/she&#xD;
        completes the run-in period and meets all of the following criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Subjects who meet both of the following criteria in terms of pulmonary function.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Has a mean morning PEF during the last 7 days (at least 4 days) prior to Visit 2&#xD;
                  is &gt;= 40% of the predicted value.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Has at least 2 days with a diurnal variation in PEF of &gt;= 15% during the run-in&#xD;
                  period, or had been confirmed and recorded reversibility of &gt;= 15% using&#xD;
                  rapid-acting inhaled beta2 agonists within 3 months prior to Visit 1 (including&#xD;
                  Visit 1).&#xD;
&#xD;
