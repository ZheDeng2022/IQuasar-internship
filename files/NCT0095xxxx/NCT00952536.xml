  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There are 3 hypotheses to be tested:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. That daily supplementation with Juice Plus+ will significantly improve treatment&#xD;
           outcomes over placebo supplementation, at 3-months post-therapy, when used as an adjunct&#xD;
           to conventional non-surgical periodontal therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Triple therapy with Juice Plus+ (fruit, vegetable &amp; berry) will produce additional&#xD;
           treatment benefit over dual therapy (fruit &amp; vegetable) and over placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Improved treatment outcomes with Juice Plus+ will be maintained at 9-months&#xD;
           post-therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Brief Summary:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Periodontal diseases are highly prevalent chronic inflammatory diseases and a major cause of&#xD;
      tooth loss. Data supports an association between periodontitis prevalence and reduced serum&#xD;
      levels of antioxidants. Anecdotal reports from periodontal specialists indicate significant&#xD;
      improvements in clinical outcomes from periodontal therapy where adjunctive Juice Plus+ is&#xD;
      used, in agreement with research data from other systemic diseases where hyper-inflammation&#xD;
      is implicated in disease pathogenesis. There is however, a lack of scientific evidence from&#xD;
      clinical trials of periodontitis. Given the demonstrable antioxidant deficiency in&#xD;
      periodontitis patients (both locally and peripherally), the excess oxidative stress in&#xD;
      periodontitis patients, and the anecdotal evidence of clinical benefit from the adjunctive&#xD;
      use of Juice Plus+, this study proposes to investigate the impact of daily supplementation&#xD;
      with Juice Plus+ as an adjunct to traditional non-surgical periodontal therapy, in improving&#xD;
      therapeutic outcomes.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This will be a longitudinal, randomised, stratified (for age), double-blind, 3-arm study of&#xD;
      non-surgical periodontal therapy. The 3 arms will be:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Daily Juice Plus+ with 2 vegetable &amp; 2 fruit &amp; 2 berry capsule (test group 1)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Daily Juice Plus+ with 2 vegetable &amp; 2 fruit &amp; 2 placebo capsule (test group 2)&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Daily Placebo in the form of 6 capsules (control group)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Volunteers will receive standard non-surgical periodontal therapy by a single operator (study&#xD;
      hygienist) and outcome measures will be assessed at baseline, 3, 6 and 9-months post-therapy.&#xD;
      Capsules will be taken with food twice daily (3 capsules am &amp; 3 capsules pm).&#xD;
&#xD;
      60 non-smoking patients with chronic moderate/severe periodontitis will be recruited from&#xD;
      outpatient periodontal clinics at Birmingham's Dental Hospital. Subjects will be 30-60 years&#xD;
      of age, male or female. Chronic periodontitis (CP) will be defined as the presence of 2 or&#xD;
      more sites per quadrant with pocketing or interproximal attachment loss of &gt; 6mm and 1/3rd&#xD;
      radiographic bone loss.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following exclusion criteria will apply:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients with aggressive disease&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients with physical or mental disability&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pregnant women&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients whose medical history may place them at risk of complications from periodontal&#xD;
           therapy (e.g. need for antibiotic cover, warfarinised subjects)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients taking long term anti-microbial or anti-inflammatory drugs&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients unable to swallow Juice Plus+ capsules&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients unable to provide informed consent&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Current smokers&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients taking regular vitamin supplementation&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome measures Primary outcome measures of healing will be increases in attachment level&#xD;
      and reductions in probing pocket depths at 3-months. In addition reduction in percentage&#xD;
      sites bleeding on probing (BOP - measured dichotomously at 4 sites per tooth) from the&#xD;
      marginal tissues and gingival redness assessed visually (Modified Gingival Index-MGI) will be&#xD;
      used as a primary outcome measure of tissue inflammation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcome measures will be reduction in % sites with disclosed plaque (PS - measured&#xD;
      dichotomously at 4 sites per tooth), reductions in gingival crevicular fluid (GCF) volume,&#xD;
      increases in GCF and plasma TAOC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Probing measures will be performed in duplicate with a constant force (UNC PC15) probe and&#xD;
      where differences between duplicate measures of greater than 1mm arise, a 3rd measure will be&#xD;
      taken. The mean of the two closest measures will be recorded. Mean probing attachment and&#xD;
      pocket depth measures per subject will be calculated at each examination point (baseline, 3,&#xD;
      6 &amp; 9-months post-therapy).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The bleeding and plaque scores will be expressed as means per subject at each examination&#xD;
      point and MGI scores as % sites with codes 0, 1, 2 and 3 per subject.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Samples GCF samples will be collected (30s) using Periopaper strips from the mesio-buccal&#xD;
      aspects of 3 deep (&gt;6mm) and 3 shallow (&lt;3mm) molar sites per subject as described in&#xD;
      appendix 1. Volumes will be read on a pre-calibrated Periotron 8000 according to standard&#xD;
      methodologies 19. Each trio of sample strips will be collected into 400ul PBS/BSA buffer and&#xD;
      snap frozen under liquid nitrogen until assay 13.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood samples (2 x 7 mls) will be collected into Vacutainer™ tubes for plasma. Platelet&#xD;
      depleted plasma will be prepared by centrifugation at 1000g for 30 mins (4C). Plasma will be&#xD;
      aliquoted into cryogenic vials and half will be snap frozen under liquid nitrogen until TOAC&#xD;
      assay. The remaining half will be aliquoted into two 1.5ml cryogenic vials and stored at -80C&#xD;
      for future use (e.g. assay for carotenoid activity). All samples will be stored in the dark&#xD;
      and kept free from direct sunlight at all stages of handling.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Enhanced chemiluminescent assay (ECL) for total antioxidant capacity (TAOC) The ECL assay for&#xD;
      total AO capacity (TAOC) was developed by our group 12 and is based upon the horse radish&#xD;
      peroxidase catalysed oxidation of luminol by hydrogen peroxide. A BioOrbit 1250 luminometer&#xD;
      (Labtech International, Sussex, UK), interfaced with a PC running software which allows&#xD;
      simultaneous recording / display of up to 5000 data points over a period up to 1 hour is used&#xD;
      to quantify light output. The enhancer, p-iodophenol, is no longer commercially available but&#xD;
      is synthesised &quot;in house&quot;. Antioxidant capacities of test samples will be derived from&#xD;
      standard curves produced using the water-soluble vitamin E analogue, 6-hydroxy-2,5,7,8,&#xD;
      tetramethylchroman-2-carboxylic acid (Trolox; assay range: 0.0625-1.6 nanomole) which will be&#xD;
      run before and after test samples and results expressed as a concentration (µM Trolox&#xD;
      equivalents/L; Teq/L).&#xD;
&#xD;
      All samples from each subject throughout the study (n=12: 8 GCF's - comprising 1 pooled from&#xD;
      deep sites &amp; 1 pooled from shallow sites @ each of 4 visits &amp; 4 plasma samples) will be&#xD;
      assayed on the same day and under the same laboratory conditions, in duplicate (total = 24&#xD;
      per subject). Each day samples from a test group 1 subject, a test group 2 subject and a&#xD;
      control subject will be run. All assays will be completed in 10-12 hours of laboratory time&#xD;
      per day and over 20 laboratory days (72 assays per day &amp; 36 standards = 108 assays per day).&#xD;
&#xD;
      GCF samples will be defrosted, eluted in running buffer for 30 minutes prior to assay, when&#xD;
      100ul aliquots will be assayed in duplicate. Plasma samples will be diluted 1:10 in PBS/BSA&#xD;
      running buffer and assayed as 20ul aliquots in duplicate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Calibrations will be run at the beginning, mid-point and end of each day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis This will be performed by an independent statistician appointed by&#xD;
      National Safety Associates Inc. All three study hypotheses presume that two subjects with the&#xD;
      same initial attachment level and pocket depth would have the same expected final attachment&#xD;
      level and pocket depth, except for the effect of their respective treatments. Therefore, the&#xD;
      first two hypotheses will be investigated by using Analysis of Covariance, with the 3 month&#xD;
      value of attachment level or pocket depth as a response, initial value as a covariate, and&#xD;
      treatment as a study factor. Hypothesis 3 will be investigated in a similar fashion, except&#xD;
      that the response will be the 9-month measurement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to test hypotheses 1 and 3, the Placebo group will be compared to the two active&#xD;
      treatment groups combined. In order to test hypothesis 2, the two active treatment groups&#xD;
      will be compared.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Graphical displays and regression models will be used to investigate whether response to the&#xD;
      active treatments is related to a subject's fruit and vegetable intake as measured by the&#xD;
      Visual Analogue Scale data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcomes will be analyzed in a similar fashion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both Intention-To-Treat (ITT) analyses and Per Protocol (PP) analyses will be performed. In&#xD;
      the ITT analyses, the data from all subjects will be used, regardless of adherence to&#xD;
      treatment. In the PP analyses, the statistical models will include measures of adherence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All statistical tests will be two-sided and performed at the 0.05 level of significance. The&#xD;
      analyses will be performed by using SAS for Windows, version 8.2 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary,&#xD;
      NC, USA), and SYSTAT, version 10.2.01 (SYSTAT Software Inc., Point Richmond, CA, USA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Missing data: The primary outcome measures are taken as part of standard care during the&#xD;
      subjects' 9-month review. There is no reason for missing data to be related to treatment or&#xD;
      outcome. We will check whether having missing data is related to treatment assignment, but&#xD;
      otherwise expect to be able to ignore missing values in the analyses because they will be&#xD;
      &quot;missing completely at random&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Code Breaking The codes will be kept sealed and locked in the office of the PI and will not&#xD;
      be broken until after the statistical analysis is complete.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Power Calculation As this is a pilot study it is not possible to perform a power calculation&#xD;
      based upon antioxidant outcomes. However, using the primary outcome measure of reduction in&#xD;
      probing pocket depth and assuming we can obtain additional PPD reductions of 0.5 mm (or&#xD;
      0.4mm) over non-surgical therapy alone through supplementation with Juice Plus+ capsules,&#xD;
      then to have an 80% chance of finding a significant difference at the p&lt;0.05 level we would&#xD;
      need to exit 12 (or 17) patients per treatment. This is based on accepted mean PPD reductions&#xD;
      for mild to moderate periodontal disease of 1-2mm with non-surgical therapy and data from a&#xD;
      study we performed that demonstrated mean PPD reductions of 1.08 + 0.4mm (SD). Recruiting 20&#xD;
      per treatment and allowing for a drop out rate of 20% would still provide sufficient power.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient Adherence Adherence with taking supplementation will be checked at each visit during&#xD;
      active therapy and again at the 3, 6, and 9-month visits. Subjects will be provided with a&#xD;
      data sheet to log days when they have missed taking supplements. In addition, one cryogenic&#xD;
      vial containing a minimum of 500ul plasma will be archived at baseline, 3, 6 and 9-months&#xD;
      post-therapy for each subject and may be used for carotenoid assay for biochemical&#xD;
      verification of adherence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      GCP Statement This study will be conducted in accordance with International Good Clinical&#xD;
      Practice (GCP) standards.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Documentation and Record-keeping The investigator will retain and archive all documents and&#xD;
      source (raw) data pertaining to the study for a minimum period of 10 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical Study Report The interpretation of the data will be the joint responsibility of the&#xD;
      Investigator and the study team. A final report will be made in writing and is the&#xD;
      responsibility of the same group and will include:-&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  appropriate statistical procedures,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  any deviation from the protocol;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  conclusions as to efficacy of the treatments and the significance of any differences&#xD;
           between them.&#xD;
