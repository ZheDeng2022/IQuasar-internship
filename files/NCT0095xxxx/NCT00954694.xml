  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to determine if participation in a fifteen week&#xD;
      introductory exercise regimen using the NuStep by sedentary adults diagnosed with Type 1 or&#xD;
      Type 2 diabetes will affect exercise adherence and lifestyle adjustment. This study will&#xD;
      examine if using the NuStep encourages participants to seek other modes and facilitates&#xD;
      interest in exercise. Age, gender, weight, height, waist-to-hip ratio, heart rate, blood&#xD;
      pressure, 6-minute walk test, and A1C will be recorded pre, mid-point, and post-test. During&#xD;
      each NuStep exercise session heart rate, blood pressure, blood glucose level, oxygen&#xD;
      saturation, METs, and the Borg rate of perceived exertion will be monitored.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Associations between NuStep use and exercise adherence are investigated through the following&#xD;
      hypothesis and null hypothesis. There is an association between using the NuStep as an&#xD;
      introductory exercise regimen by sedentary adults diagnosed with Type 1 or Type 2 diabetes&#xD;
      and exercise adherence. The null hypothesis states there is no association between using the&#xD;
      NuStep as an introductory exercise regimen by sedentary adults diagnosed with Type 1 or Type&#xD;
      2 diabetes and exercise adherence. The primary endpoint of the study is the qualitative&#xD;
      measurement, by use of a questionnaire, of attitude and interest toward exercise in&#xD;
      participants by assessing if they choose to seek and perform other modes of exercise.&#xD;
      Secondary endpoints are the quantitative measurement of the change in weight, waist-to-hip&#xD;
      ratio, heart rate, blood pressure, 6-minute walk test, and A1C levels.&#xD;

    <description>The NuStep is a mode of exercise that has recently been used in clinical settings to determine appropriate intensity recommendations and energy expenditures. The NuStep exercise implement provides simultaneous upper and lower body movement while in a seated position. The machine stimulates all major muscle groups while putting minimal strain on joints. Ten resistance settings are offered and the device is fully adjustable to accommodate users of varying sizes (NuStep, 2009).</description>
