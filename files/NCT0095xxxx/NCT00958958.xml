      Phase 1: An observational study (registry) will be conducted which will objectively document&#xD;
      the ACS clinical practice in Brazilian public hospitals, and identify the important barriers&#xD;
      for the evidence usage incorporation in the clinical practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 2: A Cluster randomized clinical trial in which public hospital will be randomized to&#xD;
      receive or not a multifaceted strategy in order to increase evidence based therapy in&#xD;
      clinical practice.&#xD;
