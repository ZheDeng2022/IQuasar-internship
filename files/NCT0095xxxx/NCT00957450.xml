  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with cervix cancer having radiotherapy experience side-effects because the&#xD;
      radiotherapy fields have to be quite large to account for tumour movement in the pelvis&#xD;
      during treatment, this irradiates a lot of normal tissues. This study aims to characterize&#xD;
      and model the tumour motion, as well as the motion of surrounding normal tissues, during&#xD;
      treatment. By doing this, the investigators can look at ways to minimise tumour motion and&#xD;
      spare more normal tissues. By tailoring the radiotherapy dose more accurately, the&#xD;
      investigators will reduce the side-effects of treatment and improve local control of the&#xD;
      tumour. By doing multiple magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans of the patients during&#xD;
      treatment, the investigators can identify where the tumour and surrounding normal tissues are&#xD;
      at that point in time. Collecting all the information from these scans, will allow the&#xD;
      investigators to model the motion of the tumour and these pelvic organs, and investigate the&#xD;
      best way to target the tumour while still sparing normal tissues.&#xD;

      At simulation: patients will have two MRI scans in addition to the standard planning CT scan.&#xD;
      One MRI scan will be with bladder full, the other will be with bladder empty. During&#xD;
      treatment: patients will have two or three MRI scans per week at their convenience. MRI scans&#xD;
      will be scheduled close to radiotherapy treatment times to minimise inconvenience for the&#xD;
      patient. On the same day they have an MRI scan, they will also have a CBCT at the time of&#xD;
      treatment. None of the images will be used to alter or influence the treatment the patient is&#xD;
      receiving. If the patient feels that the imaging schedule is too inconvenient, they will be&#xD;
      given the option to reduce the frequency of the scanning or to withdraw from the study.All&#xD;
      the images will be loaded onto a password secure server. The MRI scans will be fused to the&#xD;
      planning CT scan using bone-to-bone matching. Tumour and intra-pelvic organs will be&#xD;
      contoured on the MRI scans. The contours will be used to create surface meshes of each organ&#xD;
      and with research software, we will be able to model the motion and deformation of these&#xD;
      organs over the course of radiotherapy. Using this data, we will be able to simulate the dose&#xD;
      impact of the organ motion on different intensity-modulated radiotherapy plans. We will also&#xD;
      explore the impact of bladder &amp; rectal filling on tumour motion.&#xD;
