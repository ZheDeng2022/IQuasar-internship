  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) is a chronic inflammatory condition of the bile ducts of&#xD;
      unknown etiology. It is characterized by diffuse inflammation and stricturing of the entire&#xD;
      biliary tree, eventually resulting in cirrhosis of the liver. Patients with PSC are at&#xD;
      increased risk for the development of cholangiocarcinoma (CCA), a cancer arising from bile&#xD;
      duct epithelium. This risk is estimated to be approximately 1 to 1.5% per year. It is&#xD;
      postulated that chronic inflammatory changes in the biliary epithelium promote CCA formation.&#xD;
      The prognosis of CCA is fatal. The only potentially curative therapy is surgical; however,&#xD;
      only a minority of patients qualify for surgical treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several studies have demonstrated overexpression of the epidermal growth factor receptor&#xD;
      (EGFR) in CCA cells. EGFR is a type 1 tyrosine kinase promoting cell proliferation, migration&#xD;
      and altered cell adhesion - typical characteristics of malignant neoplasias. In CCA cells,&#xD;
      EGFR-activation is sustained resulting in cancer progression. In human CCA samples,&#xD;
      EGFR-expression correlates with higher histologic grade, poor prognosis, and risk of&#xD;
      recurrence. The EGFR gene is located on the short arm of chromosome 7 (7p12). Chromosomal&#xD;
      abnormalities of the bile duct epithelium, particularly trisomy 7 (i.e. three copies of&#xD;
      chromosome 7) can be detected in biliary epithelial samples obtained by endoscopic retrograde&#xD;
      cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) in PSC patients. The finding of cells with trisomy 7 has&#xD;
      preceded the development of aneuploidy and multiple chromosomal abnormalities in a number of&#xD;
      patients, the latter chromosomal abnormalities are characteristic of CCA. Trisomy 7 amplifies&#xD;
      the gene for EGFR thereby presumably promoting overexpression of this growth factor receptor.&#xD;
      In a cohort of patients with Trisomy 7 and Primary Sclerosing Cholangitis patients followed&#xD;
      for 1 year, the rate of development of Cholangiocarcinoma was 35% (n=37, Dr. Gores,&#xD;
      unpublished observation). Patients without cytologic abnormalities were at minimal risk for&#xD;
      the development of CCA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Erlotinib (Tarceva) is a human EGFR type 1 tyrosine kinase inhibitor. Tarceva received FDA&#xD;
      approval as single agent treatment for patients with locally advanced or metastatic non-small&#xD;
      cell lung cancer. In a randomized, double blind, placebo controlled trial of 731 patients,&#xD;
      receiving 150 mg of Tarceva or placebo once daily, median survival was prolonged to 6.7&#xD;
      months from 4.7 months (p&lt;0.001). Analysis of epidermal growth factor receptor expression&#xD;
      (45% of total study patients) demonstrated greater survival benefit in EGFR positive&#xD;
      patients. Tarceva in combination with Gemcitabine is also FDA approved as first line therapy&#xD;
      in patients with locally advanced, unresectable or metastatic pancreatic cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our central hypothesis is that patients with trisomy 7 will have carcinogenic changes&#xD;
      including EGFR overexpression. EGFR blockade will inhibit a growth/survival advantage for&#xD;
      these premalignant clones eliminating them from the biliary epithelium. As an initial step&#xD;
      towards testing this hypothesis, the tolerability of Tarceva in this patient population needs&#xD;
      to be established. This study will assist in determining the safety and tolerability of&#xD;
      Tarceva in patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis. This study will be followed by a&#xD;
      Phase 2 randomized controlled trial of Tarceva in patients with Primary Sclerosing&#xD;
      Cholangitis with Trisomy 7.&#xD;
