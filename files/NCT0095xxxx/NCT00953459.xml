      RATIONALE: Sunitinib malate may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the&#xD;
      enzymes needed for cell growth and by blocking blood flow to the tumor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well sunitinib malate works in treating patients&#xD;
      with small cell lung cancer.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the therapeutic activity of sunitinib malate in patients with either&#xD;
           chemonaïve extensive stage or sensitive relapsed small cell lung cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To characterize the safety of sunitinib malate in these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tertiary&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the potential of FDG-PET-scan to serve as a surrogate marker of response&#xD;
           for the antiangiogenic activity of the compound.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to disease stage&#xD;
      (chemonaïve extensive stage vs sensitive relapse at least 3 months after stopping&#xD;
      chemotherapy).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive oral sunitinib malate once daily for up to 1 year in the absence of disease&#xD;
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients undergo fludeoxyglucose F 18 positron emission tomography of the chest at week 4.&#xD;
      Blood samples and bronchial washings and brushings may be collected at baseline and at 4 and&#xD;
      8 weeks after start of therapy for further analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months.&#xD;
