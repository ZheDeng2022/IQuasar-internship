      Randomized, open, single ascending dose, parallel study to evaluate the pharmacokinetics,&#xD;

      Eligibility for participation of this study was determined from demographic information,&#xD;
      medical history, physical examination, electrocardiogram (ECG) and clinical laboratory tests&#xD;
      within 3 weeks before study drug administration. Subjects suitable for this study were&#xD;
      admitted to the Clinical Trials Center, Seoul National University Hospital on the day before&#xD;
      dosing, and they were overnight-fasted from 10 p.m. of Day -1. Subjects were dosed study drug&#xD;
      orally with 240 ml water around at 9 a.m. of Day 1 and they were fasted until 4 hours&#xD;
      post-dose. Subjects performed scheduled procedures including clinical laboratory tests,&#xD;
      electrocardiograms and pharmacokinetic samplings. During admission, subjects were served low&#xD;
      calcium diets. Subjects were discharged on Day 2, and visited Clinical Trials Center on Day&#xD;
      3, Day 4 and Day 5. Study participation was terminated on post-study visit (Day 7 - 10).&#xD;
