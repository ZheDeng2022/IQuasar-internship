      Randomized, double-blind placebo controlled trial of fish oil to decrease inflammation in&#xD;
      pregnancy.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In addition to the increase in obesity in adult and children, there has been a significant&#xD;
      increase in birth weights over the last 2 decades. Based on our preliminary data, maternal&#xD;
      pre-gravid obesity is the strongest risk factor for neonatal as well as adolescent obesity.&#xD;
      The long-term goals of our research are to examine therapeutic strategies to decrease fetal&#xD;
      adiposity. Obesity and pregnancy are both insulin resistant conditions associated with&#xD;
      chronic low-grade inflammation. Therefore, we hypothesize that n-3 PUFA dietary supplements&#xD;
      during pregnancy will act as insulin sensitizers decreasing peripheral insulin resistance and&#xD;
      inflammation. If correct this mechanism should decrease availability of maternal nutrients to&#xD;
      the fetus and subsequently reduce adiposity at birth. We plan a prospective randomized double&#xD;
      blind control trial of n-3 PUFA supplementation and placebo in overweight/obese women, with a&#xD;
      previous cesarean delivery, initiated in early pregnancy and maintained throughout pregnancy.&#xD;
      This proposal has two specific aims. Specific aim 1 is to evaluate the effect of n-3 PUFA&#xD;
      supplementation on maternal insulin sensitivity. Measures of maternal insulin sensitivity and&#xD;
      lipid metabolism will be made using the ISogtt, indirect calorimetry body composition&#xD;
      (BODPOD) and plasma lipid profile at baseline and after dietary intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific aim 2 will assess the effect of n-3 PUFA on the inflammatory status in&#xD;
      overweight/obese pregnant women. We hypothesize that n-3 PUFA supplementation decreases&#xD;
      chronic inflammation during pregnancy by preventing monocyte activation and accumulation of&#xD;
      macrophages in WAT thus lowering systemic concentration of pro-inflammatory cytokines. We&#xD;
      plan to characterize the longitudinal changes in circulating monocytes and plasma adipokines&#xD;
      in order to define the inflammatory patterns in both groups over time. We will also determine&#xD;
      the abundance and phenotype of macrophages infiltrating WAT using flow cytometry,&#xD;
      immunohistochemistry and gene expression profiling. Furthermore, the role of PPARγ as a&#xD;
      central target of n-3 PUFA action to regulate insulin sensitivity will be examined by&#xD;
      characterizing the expression of PPARγ in WAT of both supplemented and control groups.&#xD;
      Additionally, we will investigate the direct affect of n-3 PUFA on the expression of&#xD;
      adiponectin and PPARγ regulated genes in primary cultured adipocytes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In summary, this proposal combines both clinical and molecular methodologies in an&#xD;
      overweight/obese subject population in order to assess the effect of n-3 PUFA on inflammation&#xD;
      and insulin resistance. Preliminary data will also be obtained on fetal body composition in&#xD;
      order to later address the prevention of the long term adverse effects (developmental&#xD;
      programming) of maternal obesity in the developing fetus.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Daily use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents&#xD;
&#xD;

             diuretics), due to increased risk of adverse pregnancy outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregestational diabetes due to increased risks of affecting fetal growth. We will not&#xD;
             exclude women who develop GDM during pregnancy but consider a sub-analyses of these&#xD;
             women depending on the number of subjects. Known maternal medical complications:&#xD;

             liver enzymes).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Platelet or red blood cell disorder (including idiopathic thrombocytopenia purpura, a&#xD;
             history of alloimmune thrombocytopenia in a previous offspring, significant anemia due&#xD;
             to hemoglobinopathy but not sickle cell trait. Iron deficiency anemia will NOT be an&#xD;
             exclusion as long as the hemoglobin is &gt; 8 gm/dl).&#xD;
