      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cocaine addiction continues to be an important public health problem with over 1.7 million&#xD;
      users in the US alone. Cocaine addiction is characterized by compulsive drug use despite&#xD;
      adverse consequences and high rates of relapse during periods of abstinence. Cocaine&#xD;
      addiction may be mediated by neuroadaptations in reward-related learning and memory processes&#xD;
      in the mesocorticolimbic dopamine system and glutamatergic corticolimbic circuitry.&#xD;
      Metabotropic glutamate subtype 5 receptors (mGluR5) likely play essential roles in mediating&#xD;
      some of the actions of drugs of abuse. Animal studies have shown that mGluR5 knock-out or&#xD;
      blockade reduces self-administration of cocaine and cocaine-induced hyper-locomotion.&#xD;
      However, to what extent mGluR5 are involved in the pathophysiology of cocaine addiction in&#xD;
      humans is currently unknown, partly due to the lack of suitable methods to reliably quantify&#xD;
      mGluR5 in the living human brain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This protocol aims to determine whether the density of mGluR5 in brain is altered in&#xD;
      participants with cocaine addiction compared to healthy controls using positron emission&#xD;
      tomography (PET) and the recently developed radiotracer for mGluR5, [18F]SP203. We also aim&#xD;
      to determine whether this density is related to genotype, history of cocaine use, and/or&#xD;
      craving for cocaine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study populations will consist of healthy adults with no history of substance abuse and a&#xD;
      matched group of healthy current primary cocaine dependent male and female participants&#xD;
      (20-50 years old.; N=40/group).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Density of mGluR5 will be measured in cocaine dependent participants and healthy adults&#xD;
      volunteers with PET and (18F)SP203, a radioligand with specificity for mGluR5. All&#xD;
      participants will undergo genotyping to identify normal or variant mGluR5 gene associated&#xD;
      with drug abuse. The intensity of craving for cocaine will be assessed while watching a video&#xD;
      about cocaine use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome measures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Density of mGluR5 will be compared between cocaine dependent participants and healthy&#xD;
      controls. In addition, correlation among the genetic polymorphism, the craving response, and&#xD;
      the density of mGluR5 will be determined.&#xD;

      <textblock>
        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Cocaine dependent participants must meet DSM-IV criteria for cocaine dependence at the time&#xD;
        of participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Control participants who provide appropriate matches for cocaine-dependent participants&#xD;
        will be recruited on the following characteristics: age, and when possible, parental&#xD;
        socio-economic status and/or years of parental education.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Control Participants:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Psychiatric disease: DSM-IV criteria will be used (American Psychiatric Association,&#xD;
             1994). No subject with a current axis I diagnosis (except for nicotine dependence)&#xD;
             will be allowed. Claustrophobia is also exclusionary.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. History of Drug Abuse: Volunteers reporting current or having a significant history of&#xD;
             illicit drug abuse will be excluded from the study. Subjects may use moderate amounts&#xD;
             of alcohol and caffeine and smoke an occasional marijuana cigarette, but must not be&#xD;
             dependent on alcohol, caffeine or marijuana. No alcohol or marijuana for at least 24&#xD;
             hours prior to scanning. No smoking after midnight on the night before a scan.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Current or Past Medication Use: Volunteers may not currently use chronic (daily for&#xD;
             more than 10 to 14 days in the last month) prescription or over the counter&#xD;
             medications, (including, but not limited to, anti-hypertensive, anti-allergy, pain).&#xD;
             Over the counter or prescription medications may be used on an occasional basis (for&#xD;
             treatment of self-limited conditions, such as occasional headache, musculoskeletal&#xD;
             discomfort, allergic symptoms or pain). All medications will be discontinued at least&#xD;
             5 days before the experimental session.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. CNS disease: History of known structural brain abnormalities (e.g., neoplasm,&#xD;
             subarachnoid cysts), cerebrovascular disease, infectious disease (e.g., abscess),&#xD;
             history of head trauma (defined as documented loss of consciousness &gt; 5 min), history&#xD;
             of seizures as an adult, sleep apnea, tic disorder.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Cardiovascular, pulmonary, or systemic disease: Repeated (measured on three separate&#xD;
             occasions) diastolic blood pressure &gt;90 mm Hg, or systolic blood pressure &gt;135 mm Hg,&#xD;
             known arrhythmia, symptomatic or known coronary artery disease; history of&#xD;
             endocarditis, cerebral embolism, obstructive pulmonary disease, Factive tuberculosis,&#xD;
             known endocrine disease (derangements in adrenal, thyroid, bone or reproductive&#xD;
             function), known chronic renal or hepatic dysfunction, HIV seropositive, known current&#xD;
             autoimmune disease involving the CNS.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Miscellaneous exclusionary criteria: Body weight greater than 300 lbs. Hematocrit &lt;&#xD;
             39.0 for males or &lt; 36.0 for females. Participants are also excluded if veins are&#xD;
             inaccessible.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Radiation exposure: Any subject who has participated in any research studies in which&#xD;
             he/she received a radiation exposure that would result in combination with the present&#xD;
             study, in a total effective radiation exposure (from research studies) exceeding 5.0&#xD;
             rem in a year.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Novocain allergy or lack of bilateral ulner and radial arterial patency in subjects&#xD;
             receiving arterial catheter as assessed by an Allen s test or Dopler test artery&#xD;
             patency for all subjects to be catheterized.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Presence in body of metallic implants or materials that could be moved by the magnet&#xD;
             of the MRI scanner: pacemakers, surgical implants, aneurism clips, dental braces,&#xD;
             bullet(s) or other metallic materials. A history of working with metal with consequent&#xD;
             possible metal fragments in the body.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Inability to lie flat for a few hours for the PET scans&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Women who are pregnant or lactating and children under the age of 18 will be excluded&#xD;
             to avoid unnecessary exposure to radiation to these populations.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Cocaine Dependent Subjects:&#xD;
&#xD;
        In addition to the exclusion criteria listed above with the exception of item i. b),&#xD;
        subjects in this group will be excluded if:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. They are actively seeking or engaged in substance abuse treatment. Justification:&#xD;
             Videos viewed during this study may produce drug craving, producing a significant risk&#xD;
             of relapse in a dependent individual attempting to remain abstinent. Any participant&#xD;
             seeking treatment will be referred to treatment, since delaying entry into treatment&#xD;
             to participate in a study unnecessarily increases exposure to the risks associated&#xD;
             with active cocaine dependence. Assessment tool(s): Clinical interview at screening&#xD;
             and repeat questioning at time of consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. They are dependent on other substances except nicotine or cocaine at the time of&#xD;
             participation. Use of other abused substances will be allowed as long as they are not&#xD;
             currently dependent on any drug except nicotine and cocaine. Justification: Dependence&#xD;
             on other substances may result in unique CNS deficits that would increase the noise in&#xD;
             our data. Further, other dependence may contaminate neural processes examined.&#xD;
             Nicotine dependence will be allowed since nicotine use is not associated with a drug&#xD;
             high in normal usage and the prevalence of nicotine dependence in cocaine using&#xD;
             individuals may make it impractical to exclude them. Assessment tool(s): Substance Use&#xD;
             Disorders module of the SCID with confirmation by clinical interview and negative&#xD;
             urine drug screen. Positive screens for cocaine are allowed.&#xD;
