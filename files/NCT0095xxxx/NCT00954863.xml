    <textblock>
      Based on the investigators previous study, seventy-four of 786 HIV-1 isolates (9.4%),&#xD;
      collected between 1999 to 2006, harbored one or more primary mutations associated with&#xD;
      antiretroviral resistance to reverse-transcriptase inhibitors (RTIs) or protease inhibitors&#xD;
      (PIs) in naïve patients. However, the drug resistance profiles for the HIV-1 integrase gene&#xD;
      is unclear. Three objectives are proposed:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To investigate and compare the drug resistance profiles for the HIV-1 integrase gene&#xD;
           between experienced and naive patients, who has not being exposed to Raltegravir.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To investigate and compare the drug resistance profiles for the HIV-1 integrase gene&#xD;
           between different subtypes (subtype B, CRF01_AE and CRF07_BC).&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To identify potential amino acid mutations in the integrase gene, which might affect the&#xD;
           efficacy of Raltegravir.&#xD;

      From 2008 to 2009, blood samples will be collected from consecutive HIV-1-infected patients&#xD;
      who received HIV care at the National Taiwan University Hospital. We expect to collect 100&#xD;
      cases who are antiretroviral naïve and 100 cases who are treatment-experienced patients. A&#xD;
      standardized case collection form will be used to record data of demographics and clinical&#xD;
      characteristics and laboratory results, such as plasma HIV RNA load (PVL) and CD4 cell&#xD;
      counts. PVL will be quantified by the Cobas Amplicor HIV-1 MonitorTM Test, version 1.5,&#xD;
      (Roche Diagnostics Corporation, Indianapolis, USA) according to manufacturer's protocol. The&#xD;
      CD4 cell count will be determined using FACSFlow (Becton Dickinson). This study was approved&#xD;
      by the Institutional Review Board of the hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The in-house genotypic drug resistance test will be performed to determine the drug&#xD;
      resistance profiles for the HIV-1 pol gene, focusing on protease, reverse transcriptase, and&#xD;
      integrase. Drug resistance mutations will be identified with the use of the HIVdb program of&#xD;
      the Stanford University HIV Drug Resistance Database (http://hivdb.stanford.edu), in&#xD;
      accordance with the drug-resistance mutation list of the International AIDS Society-USA&#xD;
      Consensus Guidelines [24]. Strains with genetic mixtures of wild-type and mutant sequences at&#xD;
      amino acid residues that code for major drug resistance will be considered to be drug&#xD;
      resistant. Based on the interpretation given by the HIVdb program, sequences will be divided&#xD;
      into the drug-resistant sequences, interpreted as having high, intermediate, and low levels&#xD;
      of resistance, and the sensitive sequences, interpreted as the sensitive and potentially&#xD;
      resistant. Multi-drug resistance (MDR) will be defined as having genotypic resistance to more&#xD;
      than one class of antiretroviral drugs. Reference sequences of various subtypes and&#xD;
      recombinants will be retrieved from the Los Alamos database&#xD;
      (http://hiv-web.lanl.gov/seq-db.html). Sequences will be aligned with the Clustal W listed in&#xD;
      the MEGA (molecular evolutionary genetics analysis) analytical package (version 3.0) [25]&#xD;
      with minor manual adjustments. The phylogenetic trees will be constructed by the&#xD;
      neighbor-joining method based on the Kimura 2-parameter distance matrix listed in the MEGA&#xD;
      software. Bootstrap values greater than 750 of 1,000 replicates are considered significant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The phenotype of those with specific or unique amino acid mutation at integrase gene will be&#xD;
      determined using in-house phenotypic assay. Briefly, the p7 to vif fragment, about 3.6kb,&#xD;
      will be amplified from patients' plasma viral RNA and cloned into our backbone viral clone&#xD;
      (Figure 1). The resultant clones will be transfected into 293 cells to produce infectious&#xD;
      viruses, whose titers will be determined by p24 assay and equal amounts of viruses will be&#xD;
      subsequently used to infect PBMC from healthy donors. Virus titers in the supernatants from&#xD;
      infected cells after 3, 5, and 7 days post infection in the presence or absence of tested&#xD;
      compounds will be determined by real-time PCR or p24 assay. The minimal concentration of&#xD;
      compounds required to reduce 50% of supernatant viral copies (EC50) will be calculated by&#xD;
      regression analysis of the dose-response curves generated from real-time PCR or p24 assay.&#xD;
