      RATIONALE: Studying samples of blood and urine from patients with cancer in the laboratory&#xD;
      may help doctors learn more about changes that occur in DNA and identify biomarkers related&#xD;
      to cancer. It may also help doctors predict how patients will respond to treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE: This clinical trial is studying blood and urine samples in patients with newly&#xD;
      diagnosed localized prostate cancer treated with hormone therapy and radiation therapy.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Detect changes in serum and urine proteomic profiles that predict outcome in patients&#xD;
           with newly diagnosed localized prostate cancer treated with hormonal therapy and&#xD;
           radiotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Identify prognostic and biochemical markers of early disease progression in patients&#xD;
           treated with this regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Identify unique protein expression and temporal alterations, in these profiles, that&#xD;
           facilitate understanding of the factors predicting relapse or toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Identify molecular signatures that allow identification of targets for therapeutic&#xD;
           intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive induction hormones* (bicalutimide and releasing-hormone agonist) for&#xD;
      approximately 4 months prior to starting radiotherapy (per standard treatment). Patients then&#xD;
      receive radiotherapy consisting of 74 Gy up to a maximum of 81 Gy to the prostate gland per&#xD;
      standard treatment.NOTE: * Patients receiving short-term hormonal treatment for 4-8 months&#xD;
      are eligible to participate in the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood and urine samples are collected at baseline, and periodically during and after&#xD;
      induction therapy for proteomic analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed up periodically for 5 years and&#xD;
      yearly thereafter for the duration of the trial.&#xD;

        Patients diagnosed with localised prostate cancer who will receive radiation therapy plus&#xD;
        hormonal therapy, for 4 - 8 months, are eligible for the trial. Patients will be eligible&#xD;
        to participate in the trial provided they have not received prior therapy for their&#xD;
        prostate cancer. It is planned that 60 patients will participate in the research study. All&#xD;
        patients will receive approx 4 months of induction hormone therapy (LHRH agonist and&#xD;
        Bicalutamide) prior to starting radiotherapy treatment.&#xD;
