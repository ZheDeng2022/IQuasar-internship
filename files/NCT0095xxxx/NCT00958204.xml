  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will investigate the additional benefits of light and ion therapy as added&#xD;
      treatments to an antidepressant (fluoxetine) in subjects with major depressive disorder&#xD;
      (MDD), versus treatment with fluoxetine alone. Outcomes will include depressive symptom&#xD;
      rating scales and measures of quality of life, work absence and productivity, and use of&#xD;
      health care services. The primary hypotheses are that, in patients with nonseasonal major&#xD;
      depressive disorder (MDD) of at least moderate severity: 1) bright light therapy or negative&#xD;
      ion therapy will be superior to a placebo condition in reducing symptoms of depression, and&#xD;
      2) the combination of fluoxetine and either bright light or negative ion therapy is more&#xD;
      effective than either monotherapy condition.&#xD;

      Rationale&#xD;
&#xD;
      Many effective treatments exist for depression, including psychotherapies and antidepressant&#xD;
      medications. However, antidepressants are not always effective, and they can produce&#xD;
      significant side effects and pose a risk of overdose. Medication can also be expensive,&#xD;
      thereby limiting accessibility. Furthermore, many people with MDD prefer to use&#xD;
      non-pharmacological treatments. Some studies have found that combination antidepressant and&#xD;
      psychotherapy is more effective than either monotherapy in people with chronic forms of MDD.&#xD;
      However, evidence-based psychotherapies such as cognitive-behavioural therapy are not widely&#xD;
      available within the Canadian health care system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For these reasons, there is great interest in finding alternative treatments to&#xD;
      antidepressants and psychotherapy. Bright light therapy, which is well established as an&#xD;
      effective treatment for seasonal affective disorder (SAD), has many attributes that make it&#xD;
      highly attractive to use for nonseasonal MDD: it is a safe, well-tolerated, inexpensive, easy&#xD;
      to use, non-pharmacological treatment that can be used as monotherapy or combined with&#xD;
      medications without the worry of drug-drug interactions. The &quot;gold standard&quot; method for&#xD;
      applying light therapy is via a 10,000 lux white fluorescent light box for 30 minutes a day,&#xD;
      usually in the early morning upon arising from bed. The mechanism of action of light therapy&#xD;
      is still unknown, but major hypotheses involve resynchronizing circadian rhythms and/or&#xD;
      restoring neurotransmitter dysfunction. Bright light has predictable phase-shifting effects&#xD;
      on circadian rhythms in humans, but studies of light therapy have not consistently&#xD;
      demonstrated correlations of phase shift with antidepressant response. Although most of these&#xD;
      studies have been done in patients with SAD, there is considerable evidence that nonseasonal&#xD;
      MDD is also associated with disturbances in circadian rhythms. Other studies have shown that&#xD;
      rapidly depleting serotonin and catecholamines can reverse the antidepressant effects of&#xD;
      light therapy in SAD, thereby demonstrating monoaminergic effects of bright light similar to&#xD;
      those seen with antidepressants. These chronobiologic and monoaminergic effects of bright&#xD;
      light provide a rationale for the use of light therapy in nonseasonal MDD. As well, initial&#xD;
      studies have shown that negative ion generators may be an effective treatment for&#xD;
      neurovegetative symptoms of SAD, specifically oversleeping, overeating, and fatigability.&#xD;
      However, relatively few studies have been conducted of light and ion therapy in nonseasonal&#xD;
      MDD. Several systematic reviews of light and ion therapy for nonseasonal MDD have shown some&#xD;
      support for efficacy, but these are based on a limited number of small-sample, poorly&#xD;
      controlled RCTs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Method&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is an 8-week, multi-centre, double-blind (subject and rater), randomized,&#xD;
      parallel-design trial to assess the efficacy of light and ion therapy when combined with&#xD;
      fluoxetine in the treatment of subjects with MDD, compared to treatment with fluoxetine&#xD;
      alone. A total of 216 depressed patients meeting entry criteria will be enrolled over a&#xD;
      three-year period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible patients will be randomized to one of four treatment conditions for the entire&#xD;
      treatment period (8 weeks):&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. light treatment using a fluorescent light box (30 minutes daily) plus a placebo pill&#xD;
           every day; or&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. negative ion generator (30 minutes daily) plus 20 mg of fluoxetine per day; or&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. negative ion generator (30 minutes daily) plus placebo pill every day; or&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. light treatment using a fluorescent light box (30 minutes daily) plus 20 mg of&#xD;
           fluoxetine per day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Half of all devices (light boxes and negative ions) will be deactivated to test placebo&#xD;
      conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcomes (HAM-D) will be primarily assessed over the telephone by raters blind to treatment&#xD;
      assignment. Other outcome measures will be assessed by patient-rated questionnaires&#xD;
      administered over the Internet using a secure web site, and by ratings from the treating&#xD;
      physician (CGI and Health Economics Assessment).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis All randomized subjects who have at least one follow-up visit will be&#xD;
      included in the analysis based on intent-to-treat. Ineligible subjects who are&#xD;
      inappropriately randomized will be excluded from the analysis. Missing data will be imputed&#xD;
      using last observation carried forward (LOCF). For the analyses the treatment variables will&#xD;
      remain coded and the analysts and investigators will remain blinded to variable identity&#xD;
      during analysis and interpretation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The pre-specified primary efficacy endpoint is the adjusted mean change from baseline to&#xD;
      endpoint (8 weeks) in the HAM-D score using LOCF. All comparisons will be analyzed using&#xD;
      ANCOVA adjusting for baseline value and centre. The secondary outcomes will also be analyzed&#xD;
      using a similar analysis, when appropriate. Post-hoc analyses will also examine observed case&#xD;
      data. Categorical data (such as proportions of the sample with adverse events) will be&#xD;
      analyzed using chi-square tests or Fisher's test where cell sizes warrant.&#xD;
