  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) are affected by an inflammatory condition&#xD;
      of the bile ducts. Unfortunately, patients with PSC have a 10 to 15 percent lifetime risk of&#xD;
      developing gallbladder and bile duct cancers. Gallbladder and bile duct cancers have a&#xD;
      five-year survival of only 5 to 10 percent. Surgery to provide a cure must remove all cancer&#xD;
      confined to one area.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to increase survival rates there is a need to identify cancer and pre-cancer early.&#xD;
      This has been difficult to do.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who have lab tests, positive imaging tests or obstructions will usually have a test&#xD;
      called ERCP (Endoscopic Retrograde Cholangiopancreatogram) to take biopsies and enlarge bile&#xD;
      ducts or opening bile ducts with stents. Patients usually have cells in the bile ducts&#xD;
      removed and analyzed, but there are not studies to show how sensitive this may be to&#xD;
      determine if the cells are cancer or pre-cancerous. A new scope with a system using light&#xD;
      filters called Narrow Band Imaging (NBI) may help detect cancer and pre-cancer more often and&#xD;
      at an earlier stage.&#xD;
