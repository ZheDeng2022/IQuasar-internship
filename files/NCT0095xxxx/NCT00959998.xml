  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Persistent cancer related fatigue (PCRF) is a common symptom experienced by many cancer&#xD;
      survivors, which may last for as long as 10 years following treatment. PCRF is currently&#xD;
      under diagnosed, with between 20% to &gt;60% of survivors experiencing this symptom. Currently&#xD;
      there are few effective treatment options for these patients. Acupressure offers a potential&#xD;
      low-toxicity self-administered treatment option to treat PCRF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators performed a pilot randomized single-blinded controlled trial of acupressure&#xD;
      in cancer survivors experiencing moderate to severe PCRF. Potential participants were&#xD;
      excluded if they had other causes of fatigue such as anemia, malnutrition, or chronic fatigue&#xD;
      syndrome. Participants were randomized to one of three treatment groups: 1. relaxation&#xD;
      acupressure (RA), 2. high intensity stimulatory acupressure (HIS), and 3. low intensity&#xD;
      stimulatory acupressure (LIS). Participants performed acupressure for 12 weeks between 3 to&#xD;
      14 times per week depending on group. Fatigue was measured with the Brief Fatigue Inventory&#xD;
      (BFI). Secondary outcomes included beliefs and expectations, assessment of blinding,&#xD;
      compliance to treatment, demographics, and clinical parameters. The effect of group on BFI&#xD;
      was assessed with ANOVA and linear regression. Correlations were also made between compliance&#xD;
      and change in BFI.&#xD;
