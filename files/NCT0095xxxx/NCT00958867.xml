  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a major health issue in Canada; it affects over 8% of the&#xD;
      population aged over 65 years. Persons with AD have a reduced quality of life as they become&#xD;
      dependent on others for activities of daily living (ADLs). This problem of loss of&#xD;
      independence - functional dependence - is one focus of this grant application. It is&#xD;
      projected that by 2020, Canada will have well over 10 million seniors with moderate to severe&#xD;
      functional dependence. Functional dependence was the most significant contributor to an&#xD;
      annual cost of dementia that had already reached $4 billion in the 1990s.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is a well-recognized risk factor for both AD and functional&#xD;
      dependence. Within the broader assessment of cognitive function, the literature suggests that&#xD;
      executive functioning - the ability to concentrate, to attend selectively, to plan and&#xD;
      strategize - is a robust cognitive predictor of functional status in seniors. Specifically,&#xD;
      Royall and colleagues demonstrated executive functioning independently explained 43% of the&#xD;
      functional status in community-dwelling seniors dementia. The researchers will investigate&#xD;
      executive functioning in seniors with MCI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomized trials of various exercise interventions have proven that exercise has many&#xD;
      systemic benefits. Data are emerging that physical activity may improve cognition -&#xD;
      specifically executive function - in healthy adults. The researchers' own pilot data suggest&#xD;
      that resistance training in seniors may improve executive functioning as assessed by&#xD;
      neuropsychological tests and neuro-imaging. However, at present the Cochrane Database of&#xD;
      Systematic Reviews indicates there are insufficient published data to guide exercise&#xD;
      prescription to prevent AD. In persons with MCI, no published studies have reported on&#xD;
      whether physical activity can improve executive function, or delay its decline and thus,&#xD;
      prevent or delay the onset of functional dependence (and later, dementia).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, among seniors with MCI, the researchers will investigate whether or not specific&#xD;
      exercise prescription can: 1) provide absolute or relative improvement in cognitive function,&#xD;
      particularly executive function; and 2) help maintain functional independence. This will&#xD;
      facilitate the development of effective exercise-based strategies for the prevention of both&#xD;
      cognitive and functional decline in the large population of seniors with MCI - people at&#xD;
      greatly increased risk for AD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The researchers' proposed research aims to ascertain whether a six-month, twice-weekly&#xD;
      aerobic training (AT) program and a six-month, twice-weekly resistance training (RT) program,&#xD;
      compared with a six-month, twice-weekly stretch &amp; relax (S &amp; R; control) program, will&#xD;
      significantly improve cognition and functional status in community-dwelling women with MCI&#xD;
      aged 70 years and older.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of six-month randomized trial, compared with the S &amp; R program, both the AT and RT&#xD;
      programs will significantly improve cognitive performance, as assessed by neuropsychological&#xD;
      testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Hypotheses:&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of the six-month randomized trial, compared with the S &amp; R program, participants&#xD;
      of the AT and RT programs will:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Demonstrate evidence of cortical plasticity by fMRI, such as increased activation in&#xD;
           cortical regions responsible for item and relational memory; and&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Will significantly improve their everyday problem solving ability.&#xD;

      STUDY DESIGN, TRIAL PROFILE, AND TIMELINE To achieve our research objectives, we will conduct&#xD;
      a six-month, single-blinded (assessors), randomized trial. 75 community-dwelling older women&#xD;
      with MCI will be randomly assigned to one of three experimental groups: 1) RT; 2) AT; or 3) S&#xD;
      &amp; R (Control). The study sample is restricted to women as the magnitude of response in&#xD;
      cognition to exercise differs between sexes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODS Recruitment We will recruit seniors who are interested in a study of exercise and&#xD;
      cognition through media such as newspaper ads, flyers, and posters in community and senior&#xD;
      centres. Interested individuals be screened. The screening session will include the&#xD;
      following: 1) MMSE ; 2) Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) ; and 4) Lawton and Brody&#xD;
      Instrumental Activities of Daily Living Scale. Individual who meet the inclusion criteria&#xD;
      will be invited to join the research study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Community-dwelling senior women as the female to male ratio for dementia is 2:1;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Aged 70 years and older;&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Subjective memory complaints as determined by interview;&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. MMSE score &gt; 24;&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Scored &lt; 26 on the MoCA;&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Visual acuity of at least 20/40, with or without corrective lenses; and&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Physician approval for participation in an exercise program. Exclusion Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
      1) Diagnosed neurodegenerative disease (e.g., AD) and stroke; 2) Have clinically significant&#xD;
      peripheral neuropathy or severe musculoskeletal or joint disease; 3) Diagnosed with a&#xD;
      psychiatric condition; 4) Previously diagnosed with dementia of any type; Measurements We&#xD;
      have extensive experience in using each of the following methods and instruments. All&#xD;
      measures, unless otherwise indicated, will be assessed at each measurement session.&#xD;
&#xD;
      General Screen and Descriptors (90 mins)&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. General Health and Socioeconomic Status: General health and socioeconomic status will be&#xD;
           ascertained by a questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Global Cognitive Function and Depression: Global cognitive function will be assessed&#xD;
           using the MMSE. The Beck's Depression Inventory (BDI) will be administered. MCI Screen:&#xD;
           There are no consensus criteria for the clinical classification of MCI. The MoCA will be&#xD;
           used to screen participants for MCI. The MoCA is a brief screening tool for MCI with&#xD;
           high sensitivity and specificity. It is a 30-point test covering eight cognitive domains&#xD;
           and scores below 26 are considered to be abnormal. A bonus point is given to those with&#xD;
           less than 12 years of education.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Physical Activity Level: Physical activity, not including the study-assigned exercise&#xD;
           classes, will be determined at baseline and throughout the six-month study period. We&#xD;
           will administer the valid and reliable Physical Activities Scale for the Elderly (PASE)&#xD;
           questionnaire monthly. Designed for those aged 65 years and older, participants use a&#xD;
           12-item scale to self-report the average number of hours per day spent participating in&#xD;
           leisure, household, and occupational physical activities over the previous seven-day&#xD;
           period.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. IADLs: Participants will complete the Lawton and Brody Instrumental Activities of Daily&#xD;
           Living Scale to screen for impaired IADLs. This scale subjectively assesses ability to&#xD;
           telephone, shopping, food preparation, housekeeping, laundry, mode of transportation,&#xD;
           responsibility for own medication, and ability to handle finances.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cognitive Performance Measures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Memory:&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will assess item and relational memory using a computerized paradigm. We will also assess&#xD;
      spatial memory and working memory (i.e., N-1 back) using computer paradigms. In all computer&#xD;
      paradigms, we will record reaction time and accuracy. We will use the RAVLT to assess verbal&#xD;
      memory.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Executive Functions:&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will assess three executive functions: 1) set shifting using the Trail Making Test (Part&#xD;
      B) and a computerized paradigm of dual-task; 2) updating (i.e., working memory) using the&#xD;
      verbal digits backward test and a computerized paradigm of N-back; and 3) response inhibition&#xD;
      using the Stroop Colour-Word Test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cortical Activation (60 mins): To accurately assess the effect of both AT and RT on cortical&#xD;
      plasticity, we will collect pre- and post-intervention fMRI data from all participants (i.e.,&#xD;
      AT, RT, and S &amp; R).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Muscular Strength: We will assess dominant quadriceps (isometric) strength by strain gauge to&#xD;
      the nearest 0.5 kilogram.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Six-Minute Walk (6 MWT): This is a walking test of physical status to assess general&#xD;
      cardiovascular capacity in seniors 19. The total distance walked in meters in six minutes is&#xD;
      recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Balance and Mobility: General balance and mobility will be assessed with the National&#xD;
      Institute on Aging (NIA) Balance Scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Everyday Problem Solving Ability will be assessed using Everyday Problems Test (EPT). The EPT&#xD;
      is a research and assessment tool for measuring adults' ability to solve tasks of daily&#xD;
      living that involve printed material. The focus of the measure is on assessing the adults'&#xD;
      cognitive competence to reason and solve problems associated with daily living.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization After baseline measurement, participants will be randomized by computer&#xD;
      generated random draw to one of the three experimental groups (AT, RT, and S &amp; R) using&#xD;
      www.randomization.com.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exercise Programs Resistance Training: The protocol for the RT program will be progressive&#xD;
      and high-intensity with the aim of increasing muscle strength in the extremities and the&#xD;
      trunk. Both a Keiser® Pressurized Air system (Keiser Corp.CA, US) and free weights will be&#xD;
      used to provide the training stimulus. Participants will undergo a two-week familiarisation&#xD;
      period with the equipment and the exercises. The exercises will consist of biceps curls,&#xD;
      triceps extension, seated row, latissimus dorsi pull downs, mini-squats, mini-lunges,&#xD;
      hamstring curls, and calf raises. The intensity of the training stimulus will initially be at&#xD;
      50% to 60% of 1 repetition maximum (RM) as determined at week two, with a work range of two&#xD;
      sets of 10-15 repetitions and progress to 75% to 85% of 1RM at a work range of six to eight&#xD;
      repetitions (two sets) by week four. The training stimulus will be increased using the 7RM&#xD;
      method, when two sets of 6-8 repetitions are completed with proper form and without&#xD;
      discomfort. Squats and lunges will be performed initially with body weight; loading will be&#xD;
      increased only when proper form is maintained for two sets of 10 repetitions. The number of&#xD;
      sets completed and the load lifted for each exercise will be recorded for each participant at&#xD;
      every class.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cardiovascular Training: The AT program will be an outdoor walking program. We will use three&#xD;
      techniques to monitor exercise intensity. Each participant will: 1) wear a heart rate monitor&#xD;
      and will be asked to work at 65% to 80% of her age specific target heart rate; 2)&#xD;
      subjectively monitor the intensity of each workout using the Rating of Perceived Exertion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stretch and Relax (Control): The S &amp;R program will consist of stretching exercises, deep&#xD;
      breathing, and relaxation techniques. There is no evidence that these exercises improve&#xD;
      cognitive function. This group will serve to control for confounding variables such as&#xD;
      physical training received by traveling to the community centre for twice-weekly classes,&#xD;
      social interaction, and changes in lifestyle secondary to study participation.&#xD;
