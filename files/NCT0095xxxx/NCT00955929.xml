  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      When a bilateral nerve-sparing radical prostatectomy (RP) is performed, recovery of erectile&#xD;
      function (rigid erections) is reported for up to 80% of patients, who are less than 60 years&#xD;
      old. Erectile function recovery is also impacted by patient age, erectile function before&#xD;
      surgery, and the length of time after surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Current evidence from studies suggests that developing erections is important, however, these&#xD;
      studies have been small, and the evidence is not definite. Animal studies suggest that&#xD;
      erection medication (Viagra, Levitra, Cialis) may protect erection tissue, even in the&#xD;
      absence of erections. However, the correct treatment plan is unknown. For example, how often&#xD;
      does a man need to take sildenafil (Viagra®) to protect his erectile function or to maximize&#xD;
      his erectile function recovery? Is only using erection medication enough for erectile&#xD;
      function recovery? Would penile injections, which almost ensure production of an erection, be&#xD;
      better than using sildenafil (Viagra®), or might a combination be even better at helping&#xD;
      recovery of erections? These are types of questions this study might answer.&#xD;
