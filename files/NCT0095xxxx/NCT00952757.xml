  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hyperprolactinaemia is a common side effect of some antipsychotics (APS), including some&#xD;
      atypicals. Clinical consequences of hyperprolactinaemia are broad including amenorrhea,&#xD;
      galactorrhea, tender breasts, gynecomastia and sexual dysfunction. Less known but also&#xD;
      present is the increased cardiovascular risk, specially in women, disorders of osteoporotic&#xD;
      type and a potential increased risk of breast and prostate cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite this growing evidence, there are no consistent published data in order to adopt&#xD;
      evidence-based decisions that may be beneficial for the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This naturalistic observational 6 months follow-up study on patients with APS-induced&#xD;
      hyperprolactinemia aims to obtain more information about the switching approach in cases of&#xD;
      hyperprolactinemia secondary to APS and to better establish the role of switching to&#xD;
      quetiapine (APS not related with the increase prolactin levels) in this problem.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hyperprolactinaemia is a common side effect of some antipsychotics (APS), including some&#xD;
      atypicals. Clinical consequences of hyperprolactinaemia include most remarkably the&#xD;
      appearance of amenorrhea, galactorrhea, tender breasts, and gynecomastia - associated with&#xD;
      dysmorphophobia and psychological disorders in some cases, particularly in men-. Another&#xD;
      common side effect is sexual dysfunction, with decreased libido, anorgasmia, and in men,&#xD;
      impotence, reduced volume ejaculated and even backward ejaculation. Less known but also&#xD;
      present is the increased cardiovascular risk, specially in women, disorders of osteoporotic&#xD;
      type. Furthermore, several authors have related hyperprolactinemic states with the&#xD;
      development of breast cancer including a potential worse prognosis of it (Mandala, 1999;&#xD;
      Clevenger 2003; Mujagic, 2004), and with the development of metastatic prostate cancer and&#xD;
      resistance to hormone therapy in men (Lisonni, 2005)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite this growing evidence and the fact that APS with no apparent increase of prolactin&#xD;
      levels exist, such as quetiapine or aripiprazole, many clinicians don't even monitor&#xD;
      prolactin levels in patients following APS treatment. And when they do, they find there are&#xD;
      no consistent published data in order to adopt evidence-based decisions that may be&#xD;
      beneficial for the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This naturalistic observational 6 months follow-up study on patients with APS-induced&#xD;
      hyperprolactinemia aims to obtain more information about the switching approach in cases of&#xD;
      hyperprolactinemia secondary to APS and to better establish the role of switching to&#xD;
      quetiapine in this problem.&#xD;
