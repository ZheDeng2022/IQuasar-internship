  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In spite of the fact that the post-myocardial infarction survival rate has improved with&#xD;
      recent medical advances, reduced heart function attributed to irreversible loss of viable&#xD;
      cardiomyocytes is still a major clinical problem.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the current study is to determine whether intramyocardial injection of autologous&#xD;
      CD133+ bone marrow stem cells yields a functional benefit in addition to coronary artery&#xD;
      bypass graft (CABG) surgery in patients with chronic ischemic coronary artery disease.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Beginning in 2001, a phase-1 equivalent feasibility and safety evaluation of intramyocardial&#xD;
      injection of autologous CD133+ bone marrow cells during elective CABG surgery was conducted&#xD;
      at Rostock University. No procedure-related adverse events were observed and there was some&#xD;
      improvement of myocardial contractility and perfusion. It was decided to proceed with a&#xD;
      controlled efficacy testing, comparing the outcome of standard CABG surgery with that after&#xD;
      CABG and CD133+ cell injection. The results of that study indicate that the additional cell&#xD;
      injection yields a better left ventricular contractility than CABG alone (LVEF = 47.1±8% vs.&#xD;
      41.3±9% at 6 months). Although this result is encouraging, the trial had several limitations&#xD;
      that hamper interpretation of the data. Most notably, no sham-injection of placebo material&#xD;
      was performed in the control group, and standard 2D echocardiography served as the only&#xD;
      measurement of global LV contractility.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, there were no procedure-related complications up to 18 months postoperatively,&#xD;
      especially no new ventricular arrhythmia or neoplasia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, a prospective, double blinded, randomized, and placebo-controlled multi-center&#xD;
      trial will be conducted in Germany, employing current state-of-the art measurement of global&#xD;
      and regional LV contractility by cardiac MRI. The following hypothesis will be tested:&#xD;
      &quot;Patients who undergo CABG &amp; CD133+ cell injection do not have a higher LV ejection fraction&#xD;
      than patient who undergo CABG alone, measured 6 months after the operation&quot;. A power analysis&#xD;
      based on the previous trial results indicated that 71 patients per group need to be enrolled&#xD;
      so as to reject the null-hypothesis with sufficient statistical power. A total of 142&#xD;
      patients will therefore be enrolled in the study. Patients will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio&#xD;
      to undergo CABG surgery in conjunction with either intramyocardial injection of autologous&#xD;
      CD133-enriched bone marrow cells or placebo. Bone marrow will be harvested one or two days&#xD;
      prior to surgery and a CD133-enriched cell product (or placebo) will be prepared at a central&#xD;
      cell processing GMP unit. Bypass surgery will be performed and the investigational product&#xD;
      will be injected in the border zone of the infarcted myocardium. Random allocation will be&#xD;
      performed in the cell production facility, so that neither the patient nor the surgeon nor&#xD;
      any of the personnel involved in follow-up examinations will know whether the cell product or&#xD;
      placebo was administered. The primary outcome parameter (LVEF at 6 months) will be measured&#xD;
      by cardiac MRI, and secondary outcome parameters include physical exercise capacity, cardiac&#xD;
      function, safety and Quality of Life (QoL).&#xD;
