  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this project is to test an intervention program for caregivers and their young&#xD;
      children with autism that is focused on improving social communication. This study&#xD;
      specifically targets underserved populations, specifically children from low SES and&#xD;
      racial/ethnic minority families. Participants will include 40 children (aged 24 months to 60&#xD;
      months) and their caregivers who will be randomized (as if by flipping a coin) to one of the&#xD;
      two treatments: Parent education sessions for two hours a week for 12 weeks or parent-child&#xD;
      intervention sessions with the child for one hour, twice a week for 12 weeks. Young children&#xD;
      with autism have difficulty with engaging in joint attention with others (e.g. pointing,&#xD;
      showing. Joint attention skills are important to later development of language. Therefore,&#xD;
      targeting this problem in young children may result in better language outcomes for these&#xD;
      children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to examine the effects of the interventions, all participants will be complete&#xD;
      cognitive, language, communication and play-based assessments prior to treatment, at the end&#xD;
      of the first 12 weeks of the intervention, and post-treatment immediately following the&#xD;
      intervention (approximately 2.5 to 3 hours each).&#xD;

      Child/parent dyads will be randomized to one of two intervention conditions: (1) Parent-child&#xD;
      model, also known as the Caregiver Education Model (CMM):focuses on joint&#xD;
      attention/engagement intervention using an established evidence based treatment (Kasari et&#xD;
      al., 2006). It involves individual interventionist meetings with the parents and their&#xD;
      children in their homes for one hour, twice a week for 12 weeks. In this intervention, the&#xD;
      parent-child pair meet with the interventionist (as opposed to the group training in the CEM&#xD;
      condition). Parents will be specifically taught techniques for altering the home environment&#xD;
      and ways to enhance children's language, social, and play development. Parents will given&#xD;
      guided practice (input and coaching from the interventionist) as they implement these&#xD;
      techniques with their child. (2)Parent-education intervention, also known as the Caregiver&#xD;
      Education Model (CEM): focuses on teaching parents information about autism, behavior&#xD;
      modification, and community services using a manualized approach (Brereton &amp; Tonge, 2005).&#xD;
      Parents will receive information on child development each week, and will be able to ask&#xD;
      questions and discuss the information vis-à-vis their own child. This intervention is&#xD;
      manualized (Brereton &amp; Tonge 2005). In the CEM condition, parents meet in a group, without&#xD;
      their children, in a community-based setting to receive the intervention. Intervention in&#xD;
      both conditions occurs for 2 hours for 12 weeks.&#xD;
