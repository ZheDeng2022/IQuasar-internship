    <textblock>
      The molecular mechanisms involved in squamous cell carcinoma of the anus (SCCA) are poorly&#xD;
      elucidated. HIV-positive and renal transplant patients are at high risk for developing SCCA,&#xD;
      indicating that immune suppression plays a facilitating role. The investigators previously&#xD;
      demonstrated that chromosomal instability (CIN) was more prevalent in SCCA of HIV-negative&#xD;
      than HIV-positive patients. Hence, the investigators postulate that microsatellite&#xD;
      instability (MSI), another molecular pathway, might be a feature of SCCA progression in the&#xD;
      HIV-positive population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. to determine the prevalence of MSI in paraffin-embedded tumor specimen of 15 patients&#xD;
           from the Swiss HIV cohort who underwent surgical excision for SCCA; and&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. eventually, to test our hypothesis by assessing the MSI status of SCCA in 15 recently&#xD;
           operated HIV-negative patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is designed in two steps:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Firstly, the investigators will retrieve tumor specimen from 15 HIV-positive patients,&#xD;
           with a biopsy-confirmed diagnosis of SCCA, in three institutions. DNA from tumor and&#xD;
           normal tissues will be extracted, and then amplified by PCR. Presence of MSI in tumors&#xD;
           will be determined by assessing the microsatellite markers BAT25, BAT26, and CAT25.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Secondly, the results of molecular analysis will be compared with a population of&#xD;
           HIV-negative patients, with the same tumors, using the same detection technique for MSI.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) era, the incidence of many cancers&#xD;
      remains higher in the HIV-positive than in the general population. This is not only true for&#xD;
      AIDS-defining malignancies, such as Kaposi's sarcoma or lymphoma, but also for other cancers,&#xD;
      which comprise 58% of all neoplasms in a recently described US cohort [1]. This trend has&#xD;
      generated renewed interest in understanding the molecular mechanisms of carcinogenesis in the&#xD;
      immune suppressed patient. Potential explanations include prolonged survival of patients with&#xD;
      HIV on HAART, high incidence of co-infection with oncogenic viruses, and exposure to risks&#xD;
      such as smoking and alcohol [2].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Squamous cell carcinoma of the anus (SCCA) requires integration of human papillomavirus (HPV)&#xD;
      DNA into anal canal cell chromosomes. HIV-positive men are at increased risk for developing&#xD;
      anal cancer. A Swiss study linking the Swiss HIV cohort study and Swiss cantonal cancer&#xD;
      registries has shown greatly elevated SIRs for anal cancer (SIR = 33.4, 95% CI = 10.5-78.6)&#xD;
      [3]. Clearly, HPV-HIV coinfection plays a major role in SCCA development, but whether this&#xD;
      contribution is associated with distinct molecular pathway of carcinogenesis, remains&#xD;
      hypothetical [4].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anal cancer occurs earlier in HIV-positive individuals (mean age 37 years) compared with&#xD;
      HIV-negative men (58 years) and HIV-negative women (65 years). This difference of two decades&#xD;
      in age of onset supports the hypothesis that the biology of SCCA differs between HIV-positive&#xD;
      and HIV-negative patients [5]. The effect of HIV infection on the natural history of anal HPV&#xD;
      infection is poorly understood, but most experts agree on two points: 1) 95% of HIV-positive&#xD;
      homosexual men are co-infected with HPV; and 2) HIV infection favors persistence of HPV&#xD;
      infection within the ano-genital tract (uterine cervix, vagina, and anal canal).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two major and mutually exclusive types of genomic instability are involved in cancer&#xD;
      progression. The first, known as chromosomal instability (CIN), results from a series of&#xD;
      genetic changes, including activation of oncogenes and inactivation of tumor-suppressor genes&#xD;
      such as p53 and APC. The second, known as microsatellite instability (MSI), results from&#xD;
      somatic (acquired) inactivation of DNA mismatch repair genes (MMR), such as MLH1 (by&#xD;
      hypermethylation of its promoter), typically leading to mutation of genes with coding&#xD;
      microsatellites, such as BAT 25, BAT26 and CAT25, transforming growth factor receptor II&#xD;
      (TGF-RII) and BAX [6].&#xD;
&#xD;
      MSI reflects genomewide instability (resulting from a deficient MMR system), and occurs at&#xD;
      increased frequency in HIV-associated cervical intraepithelial and lung neoplasia. In both&#xD;
      cases, the frequency of MSI was six fold greater in the HIV-associated tumors, compared with&#xD;
      tumors of HIV-indeterminate patients [7]. Others authors have also reported a high rate of&#xD;
      MSI in Kaposi's sarcomas and aggressive lymphomas obtained from HIV-infected patients,&#xD;
      whereas there is no evidence of similar instability in lesions from HIV-negative patients&#xD;
      [8]. The recent observation that the MSI phenotype is restricted to HIV-related lymphomas&#xD;
      suggests that a cardinal feature of cancer, such as genetic instability, can be highly&#xD;
      influenced by host immunity [9].&#xD;
&#xD;
      MSI status of SCCA in HIV-positive patients has never been investigated, but we have&#xD;
      performed a CIN analysis of tumor specimens from 18 HIV- and 10 HIV+ patients diagnosed with&#xD;
      SCCA in two US institutions [10]. Tumors in HIV-negative patients were more likely to present&#xD;
      CIN than were tumors in HIV-positive patients (24.1% versus 6.6%, P&lt;0.001). Consistent loss&#xD;
      of heterozygosity (LOH) on chromosomes 17p, 18q, 5q, and 11q was observed in HIV-negative&#xD;
      patients with SCCA. By contrast, allelic loss at 17p, 5q, and 18q was virtually absent in&#xD;
      tumors of HIV-positive individuals, indicating that immune suppression promote SCCA&#xD;
      progression through an alternate pathway to CIN.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Own Research in the Field:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The applicant is a colorectal surgeon, directly involved in the treatment of patients with&#xD;
      anorectal malignancies since 2001. He has collected preliminary data showing specific&#xD;
      patterns of molecular aberrations in HIV-related SCCA. These findings have been published in&#xD;
      peer-reviewed journals, with the consequence that the applicant is regularly solicited by&#xD;
      Editors to write expert opinions and state of the art reviews in the field.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Swiss cohort of HIV-positive patients will provide a unique opportunity to conduct this&#xD;
      research, because of the large number of individuals already enrolled in the existing&#xD;
      database, and the existing expertise in the field developed by Professor Hirschel and his&#xD;
      team. A large population of patients is indeed a sine qua none condition to start this&#xD;
      project due to the relative rarity of these tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Last but not least, the molecular aspect of this research will be conducted in the laboratory&#xD;
      of Dr Pierre Hutter, PhD, who is a leader in our country for the detection of hereditary&#xD;
      non-polyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC). Thus, Dr Hutter laboratory will provide an excellent&#xD;
      environment to perform the molecular analyses described herein.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Hypotheses:&#xD;
&#xD;
      We hypothesize that, in the HIV population, microsatellite instability, rather than&#xD;
      chromosomal instability, is the favoured pathway for rapid progression of anal&#xD;
      intra-epithelial neoplasia towards invasive SCCA. The second hypothesis is that, by&#xD;
      comparison, MSI is either absent or at least very rare in SCCA of HIV-negative individuals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Aims and Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of this study is to assess microsatellite instability status in tumor&#xD;
      specimens of 15 HIV-positive patients from the Swiss Cohort who were diagnosed with SCCA; an&#xD;
      interim analysis will then be performed to determine the incidence of MSI in SCCA of&#xD;
      HIV-positive patients. If a majority of tumours exhibit MSI in this population, we will&#xD;
      proceed with the second part of the study, which objective is to perform the same analyses in&#xD;
      similar tumors of 15 HIV-negative patients, and thus to compare the molecular profiles of&#xD;
      SCCA in both populations. By doing so, the potential role of immune suppression in&#xD;
      carcinogenesis progression might be established.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design and Plan&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients from the Swiss HIV cohort with a biopsy-proven diagnosis of squamous cell carcinoma&#xD;
      of the anus will be identified using the existing database. We choose to analyse at least 15&#xD;
      samples, depending on availability, between 3 SHCS centers. Tumors from HIV-negative patients&#xD;
      who underwent surgery for SCCA will be retrieved from the Department of Pathology of&#xD;
      University Hospital Geneva, pending review of the protocol by the local Ethics Committee.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All tumor samples will be reassessed for confirmation of diagnosis by a pathologist. For each&#xD;
      patient, paraffin blocks with both tumor tissue and normal mucosa will be selected for DNA&#xD;
      extraction and polymerase chain reaction at microsatellite targets. The tissues were&#xD;
      routinely collected from the operating room, fixed in buffered formalin, embedded in&#xD;
      paraffin, and stored for a variable number of months prior to selection for analysis.&#xD;
      Paraffin-embedded blocks will be cut with a microtome into 20-µm thick sections. Using a&#xD;
      sterile scalpel blade, areas of normal (non-tumor) and cancer tissue will be microdissected&#xD;
      under a dissecting microscope utilizing a haematoxylin and eosin-stained section as a guide.&#xD;
      The specimens will be deparaffinised in toluol, purified with absolute ethanol, and&#xD;
      centrifuged at 14,000 rpm. Previous experience in Dr Hutter's laboratory has demonstrated&#xD;
      that it is indeed technically possible to perform this type of molecular analysis in&#xD;
      paraffin-embedded tumour specimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will use the reference panel of microsatellite primers recommended for colorectal cancer&#xD;
      specimens to determine the presence of microsatellite instability in SCCA. These include the&#xD;
      microsatellite markers BAT25, BAT26, as well as CAT25.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Evaluations:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Initial evaluation of data will be performed after analysis of the first 15 tumours specimen.&#xD;
      If MSI is detected in the HIV-positive population, further investigation will be conducted in&#xD;
      tumors of HIV-negative patients. Data analysis will be subject to progress reports conducted&#xD;
      with all investigators at regular intervals. We chose to restrict, at least initially, our&#xD;
      analysis to 15 tumours for three reasons:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. This is a relatively rare cancer, and it is unlikely that we will be able to retrieve&#xD;
           more than 25 SCCA patients from the Swiss HIV cohort.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Our previous study was conducted with 18 tumours specimen in each group, and the&#xD;
           differences between groups were statistically significant.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. This is a pilot exploratory study, and the working hypothesis may prove wrong; it is&#xD;
           therefore critical to limit the initial costs in accordance with the study budget and&#xD;
           availability of Dr Hutter's expertise. If our hypothesis is supported by the initial&#xD;
           results, we may proceed with additional investigations and a more elaborated research&#xD;
           project with adequate funding resources.¨ For these reasons, we will restrict our&#xD;
           research to three SHCS centers. Zurich, Geneva and Lausanne were chosen essentially&#xD;
           based on existing relationship between the visceral surgery units.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      MSI status of tumors will be assessed by Pierre Hutter. The results will then be correlated&#xD;
      with the epidemiological data from the Swiss cohort, and correlated with the patients'&#xD;
      clinical characteristics, including viral load, CD4+ count, as well as clinical outcome. The&#xD;
      results will also be correlated with treatment outcome and cancer survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Time Frame:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tumor specimen will be retrieved from the Departments of Pathology in Lausanne, Geneva and&#xD;
      Zurich in the beginning of 2009. The MSI analysis is a straightforward procedure, which takes&#xD;
      about 24 hours in the laboratory of Dr Hutter. Thus, the analysis of the 15 specimen in the&#xD;
      HIV-positive population will be completed by the end of March 2009. Further decision&#xD;
      regarding subsequent analyses in the HIV-negative population will then be subjected to&#xD;
      decision, according to the results obtained in these initial tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Status of Ethical Approval:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients enrolled in the Swiss HIV cohort study initially gave their consent for&#xD;
      participating in this type of study. Almost all patients at the HIV centres consented to take&#xD;
      part in genetic research in order to identify specific factors that might result in&#xD;
      differences in the course of the disease. Obviously, all analyses will be performed on tumor&#xD;
      specimen, and these will not be traceable to the patients' identities. Thus, all genetic&#xD;
      testing will be totally anonymous. By contrast, further approval by the local Ethics&#xD;
      Committee in Geneva will be sought, should the analysis be performed on tumor specimen from&#xD;
      HIV-negative patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study budget:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The initial analysis of 15 HIV-positive patients will be performed free of charge by Pierre&#xD;
      Hutter. The cost for molecular study is estimated at 250.-CHF per case. Thus, in case the&#xD;
      analysis of MSI in this group leads to promising results, it is estimated that the cost of&#xD;
      analysis in 12-15 HIV-negative patients will cost around 3,000.-CHF. Funding for this type of&#xD;
      research will be available through the Fonds de Service of Department of Surgery at&#xD;
      University Hospital Geneva.&#xD;
