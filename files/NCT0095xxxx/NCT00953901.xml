    <textblock>
      Blood clotting abnormalities or problems that happen during surgery ? even minor surgery ?&#xD;
      are serious because of the possibility of serious bleeding that cannot be stopped. The&#xD;
      current standard practice for people with clotting abnormalities is to transfuse additional&#xD;
      blood before the surgery, in an effort to decrease bleeding problems. However, transfusing&#xD;
      blood before the surgery is not very effective in decreasing bleeding complications. In&#xD;
      addition, it may be associated with other complications, including fluid buildup and swelling&#xD;
      in the lungs. For this study, a person with a mild clotting problem is defined as one with an&#xD;
      INR (International Normalized Ratio) between 1.5 and 3. Severe clotting is defined as an INR&#xD;
      greater than 3. This study will aim to test if limiting or restricting transfusion for those&#xD;
      patients with severe clotting problems (an INR greater than 3) will result in fewer&#xD;
      transfusion problems and fewer unnecessary transfusions in comparison with the current, more&#xD;
      liberal, transfusion use for all patients with both mild and severe clotting problems (an INR&#xD;
      greater than 1.5).The investigators will also determine if liberal blood transfusion&#xD;
      decreases the risk of bleeding after surgical procedures.&#xD;

      While the restrictive red cell transfusion practice has become a standard of care in the&#xD;
      acutely ill, data on the use of fresh frozen plasma (FFP) are limited. FFP transfusion may&#xD;
      not only be poorly effective in prevention of bleeding complications but is associated with&#xD;
      significant complications. In a retrospective cohort of critically ill non-surgical patients&#xD;
      with abnormal international normalized ratio (INR), we have observed significant variability&#xD;
      in the practice of FFP transfusion. Rather than a benefit with liberal use, more adverse&#xD;
      effects were observed, in particular pulmonary edema and acute lung injury. Our overall goal&#xD;
      is to improve the safety of blood product transfusion and prevent pulmonary complications.&#xD;
      Here we propose a randomized clinical trial of restrictive (INR 1.6-3) versus liberal (FFP&#xD;
      transfusion to keep INR &lt; 1.6) FFP transfusion prior to commonly performed invasive&#xD;
      procedures (thoracocentesis, abdominal paracentesis and central venous cannulation). We will&#xD;
      use the following outcome measures to compare the differences between the two groups: 1. New&#xD;
      onset pulmonary edema; 2. Postprocedural bleeding complications; 3. Number of blood product&#xD;
      transfusions; 4. Hospital mortality and 5. Length of intensive care unit and hospital stay.&#xD;
      The results of this study will form the basis for future multicenter clinical trials with&#xD;
      implications for worldwide transfusion practice.&#xD;
