  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cardiovascular disease is a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. It is the&#xD;
      second leading cause of death in Hong Kong. The disease burden is huge and effective control&#xD;
      measures should target at prevention level. As the disease pathophysiology is linked to&#xD;
      chronic low grade systemic inflammation, any therapeutics having the potential to reduce&#xD;
      systemic inflammation should be vigorously explored.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The use of long-term inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) treatment in recent 2 decades has become&#xD;
      the cornerstone in the treatment of most patients with persistent asthma with reduction in&#xD;
      its mortality and hospital utilization. The long term safety of ICS in adults is generally&#xD;
      very high.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recent epidemiological studies utilizing large numbers of patients with asthma have shown&#xD;
      that long term use of ICS is independently associated with a protective effect towards the&#xD;
      development of myocardial infarction and cardiovascular mortality, with protective risk at&#xD;
      0.35 (95%CI 0.13-0.93). This effect is possibly mediated through the reduction of low grade&#xD;
      systemic inflammation as reflected by plasma hs-CRP, from systemic absorption of the ICS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to explore the potential protective effect of ICS on&#xD;
      cardiovascular morbidities and its underlying link with systemic inflammation in Chinese&#xD;
      adults with asthma compared with matched controls from the general population.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Globally, cardiovascular disease is a major cause of mortality and morbidity. In the past 2&#xD;
      decades in Hong Kong, it has been the second leading cause of death, with death rate reaching&#xD;
      50/100,000 population in 2006, and the third leading cause of hospitalizations in Hospital&#xD;
      Authority Hospitals between 2001-2005. The disease burden is huge and effective control&#xD;
      measures should target at prevention level.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There has been substantial evidence from landmark epidemiological studies in the past 10&#xD;
      years that chronic low grade systemic inflammation, predominantly based on plasma hs-CRP, is&#xD;
      an independent predictor for the development of hypertension, myocardial infarction, stroke,&#xD;
      cardiovascular death and peripheral vascular disease. A dose-dependent risk association&#xD;
      between hs-CRP and these cardiovascular morbidities has also been consistently demonstrated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Asthma is a chronic inflammatory airway disorder associated with airflow obstruction and&#xD;
      bronchial hyper-responsiveness, which affects about 10% of population in Hong Kong. It is a&#xD;
      major respiratory disease in Hong Kong that carries significant morbidity and high&#xD;
      hospitalization burden in all ages. The use of long-term inhaled corticosteroid (ICS)&#xD;
      treatment in recent decades has become the cornerstone in the treatment of most patients with&#xD;
      persistent asthma with reduction in its mortality and hospital utilization. The ultimate goal&#xD;
      of treatment is to achieve optimal control of airway inflammation and to reduce mortality and&#xD;
      morbidity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although the pathogenesis of asthma is incompletely understood, studies have shown that it is&#xD;
      associated airway inflammation and a state of increased free radical formation, because cells&#xD;
      derived from airways and peripheral blood of patients with asthma generate increased amount&#xD;
      of reactive oxygen species, the level of which is related to severity of asthma. Recent&#xD;
      preliminary studies have indicated that, apart from the presence of chronic airway&#xD;
      inflammation, asthma may also be associated with chronic low grade systemic inflammation and&#xD;
      increased oxidative stress. Intuitively, this asthma-related systemic inflammation may&#xD;
      increase the risk for development of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite the propensity of asthma towards cardiovascular morbidity, recently, several&#xD;
      epidemiological studies utilizing large numbers of patients with asthma have shown that long&#xD;
      term use of ICS is independently associated with a protective effect towards the development&#xD;
      of myocardial infarction and cardiovascular mortality, with protective risk at 0.35 (95%CI&#xD;
      0.13-0.93). This effect is possibly mediated through the reduction of low grade systemic&#xD;
      inflammation as reflected by plasma hs-CRP from systemic absorption of the ICS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This potential effect of ICS on reduction of chronic low grade systemic inflammation has an&#xD;
      invaluable implication for its future application as a preventive medicine against the&#xD;
      development of cardiovascular morbidities and mortality, especially in high risk patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ICS have been launched for more than 20 years, and is currently the first-line treatment for&#xD;
      asthma. Their systemic side effects are much less than that of oral corticosteroids. Long&#xD;
      term safety of ICS in adults is generally very high, but mild increases in risk of&#xD;
      osteoporosis, cataracts and glaucoma have been reported in patients with high dose ICS use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to explore the potential protective effect of ICS on&#xD;
      cardiovascular morbidities and its underlying link with systemic inflammation in Chinese&#xD;
      adults with asthma compared with matched controls from the general population.&#xD;
