      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of the night procedure in regards to&#xD;
      colon cleansing level and capsule excretion rate.&#xD;

      The evaluation of subjects with suspected colonic disease includes endoscopic imaging by&#xD;
      colonoscopy and radiologic imaging such as air-contrast barium enema, or CT colonography. The&#xD;
      Given® Diagnostic System offers an alternative approach for endoscopic visualization of the&#xD;
      colon using capsule endoscopy, an ingestible device which contains imagers, light sources, a&#xD;
      power source and a RF transmitter. Advantages of the Given® Diagnostic System include the&#xD;
      elimination of the need for sedation, the minimally invasive, painless nature of the exam,&#xD;
      and the ability to pursue normal daily activities immediately following the procedure .&#xD;
      Furthermore, compared to standard colonoscopy, the Given® Diagnostic System may be more&#xD;
      readily accepted by the subjects, thereby improving subjects' willingness to undergo a&#xD;
      diagnostic evaluation of the colon and comply with colorectal cancer screening&#xD;
      recommendations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The PillCam™ SB capsule (formerly M2A® Capsule) that was FDA-approved in August 2001 for&#xD;
      small bowel evaluation has been ingested to date by more than 500,000 people worldwide and is&#xD;
      well accepted by patients and physicians as well as the processional societies. However,&#xD;
      adequate visualization of the colon cannot be achieved with the standard PillCam™ SB capsule&#xD;
      because of the anatomical and physiological properties of the colon which are significantly&#xD;
      different than the small bowel. Moreover, other issues that limit the evaluation of the&#xD;
      colonic mucosa by the standard PillCam™ SB procedure include an unsatisfactory level of colon&#xD;
      cleanliness and slow progression of the PillCam™ SB capsule through the colon during the&#xD;
      desired examination time. Therefore, the development and introduction of a specially&#xD;
      designed, customized colon capsule combined with a dedicated capsule colonoscopy procedure&#xD;
      protocol will allow for more efficient evaluation of the colonic mucosa. This is expected to&#xD;
      improve the capability of the Given® Diagnostic System to detect colonic pathologies and to&#xD;
      serve as a diagnostic and screening tool for colonic disease. Further details of the PillCam™&#xD;
      Colon Capsule Endoscope (PCCE) can be found in the device description section.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a pilot study that is designed to evaluate the level of cleanliness and visualization&#xD;
      of colon achieved by colon capsule endoscopy when using Night procedure regimens for&#xD;
      preparation of the colon.&#xD;
