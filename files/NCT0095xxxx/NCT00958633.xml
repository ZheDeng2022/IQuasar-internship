  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with bipolar I disorder (BD) experience depression 3 times more frequently than&#xD;
      mania, and antidepressants are prescribed as adjuncts to mood stabilizers in up to 70% of&#xD;
      patients. However, no placebo-controlled trials have assessed the efficacy or safety of&#xD;
      modern antidepressants in combination with mood stabilizers in the maintenance treatment of&#xD;
      BD. The investigators propose a multicentre, randomized, double-blind clinical trial&#xD;
      comparing mood stabilizer plus antidepressant (escitalopram or bupropion XL) to mood&#xD;
      stabilizer plus placebo in the maintenance treatment of BD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that in clinically representative patients with bipolar&#xD;
      disorder, who respond to acute treatment with a newer antidepressant medication in&#xD;
      conjunction with a mood stabilizing medication, continuing the antidepressant for 12 months&#xD;
      will reduce the risk of relapse into any mood episode, including depression, mania, and&#xD;
      hypomania, compared to stopping the antidepressant after 8 weeks.&#xD;

      Study Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators propose a multicentre, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial&#xD;
      in patients with BD who are currently experiencing a depressive episode. The trial will&#xD;
      consist of two phases: an open-label acute treatment phase, and a double-blind maintenance&#xD;
      treatment phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OPEN-LABEL ACUTE TREATMENT PHASE&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experimental Design Patients with BD depression who are receiving treatment with antimanic&#xD;
      medication(s), defined as: 1) a mood stabilizer (lithium or divalproex ), 2) a&#xD;
      second-generation antipsychotic (SGA) (risperidone, olanzapine, quetiapine, aripiprazole, or&#xD;
      ziprasidone), or 3) combination anti-manic therapy (two mood stabilizers; or a mood&#xD;
      stabilizer plus an SGA (the SGA asenapine will also be permitted if prescribed with a mood&#xD;
      stabilizer); or a mood stabilizer or SGA plus lamotrigine), will have open-label escitalopram&#xD;
      10-30 mg/day or bupropion XL 150-450 mg/day added to their medication(s) for up to 16&#xD;
      weeks.Patients who complete at least 4 weeks of treatment and achieve remission from their&#xD;
      index depression which is maintained for ≥ 2 weeks will be eligible to enter the double-blind&#xD;
      study phase. The duration of treatment in the open-label phase will be 4-16 weeks, depending&#xD;
      on the time required to achieve remission.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DOUBLE-BLIND MAINTENANCE TREATMENT PHASE&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who are in remission from their index depression for ≥ 2 weeks and ≤ 8 weeks are&#xD;
      eligible to take part in the double-blind maintenance phase. There are two routes to enter&#xD;
      the double-blind phase:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  following completion of the open-label phase, or&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  following a period of clinical treatment, not exceeding 16 weeks, with the same&#xD;
           medications used in the open-label phase. Patients who respond to clinical treatment&#xD;
           with carbamazepine plus an antidepressant may also enter the double-blind phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experimental Design&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the double-blind phase, all patients will continue treatment with their anti-manic&#xD;
      medication(s) and will be randomized to one of two treatment arms for up to 52 weeks:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients randomized to the &quot;8 week arm&quot; will discontinue antidepressant treatment after&#xD;
           8 weeks, as recommended in current clinical practice guidelines..&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients randomized to the &quot;52 week arm&quot; will continue treatment with their&#xD;
           antidepressant medication for 52 weeks, or until withdrawal from the study.&#xD;
