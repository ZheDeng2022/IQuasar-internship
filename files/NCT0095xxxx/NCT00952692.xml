  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase I/II study to determine the safety and gain insight into the immune response&#xD;
      of the immunologic agent dHER2+AS15 ASCI when administered in combination with lapatinib.&#xD;
      This study is for patients with metastatic breast cancer (invasive breast cancer with stage&#xD;
      IV disease) that overexpresses HER2 and is resistant to trastuzumab (Herceptin).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The dHER2 + AS15 candidate Antigen-Specific Cancer Immunotherapeutic (ASCI) contains a&#xD;
      recombinant protein termed dHER2, which is a truncated version of the HER2 protein. HER2 is a&#xD;
      protein that is commonly overexpressed in breast cancer. This protein is combined with the&#xD;
      immunological adjuvant AS15 Adjuvant System from GSK (GlaxoSmithKline), which is a liposomal&#xD;
      formulation containing three immunostimulatory components.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lapatinib is FDA approved for use in combination with capecitabine for the treatment of&#xD;
      subjects with advanced or metastatic breast cancer whose tumors overexpress HER2.&#xD;

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        The following criteria are to be checked at the time of study entry. The patients may only&#xD;
        be included in the study if ALL of the following statements are FULLFILLED:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. The patient (male or female) is at least 18 years old at the time of signature of the&#xD;
             informed consent form.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Written informed consent has been obtained from the patient prior to the performance&#xD;
             of any protocol-specific procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. The patient is diagnosed with confirmed invasive breast cancer with stage IV disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
             Note: If the metastatic disease is restricted to a solitary lesion, its neoplastic&#xD;
             nature should be confirmed by cytology or histology.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. The patient has documented disease progression or relapse following at least one prior&#xD;
             standard therapy with trastuzumab (alone or in combination with chemotherapy).&#xD;
&#xD;
             Patients with prior lapatinib use are eligible. Furthermore,&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  The administration of the chemotherapeutic agent(s) should have been stopped for&#xD;
                  at least 28 days by the time of the first ASCI administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  The administration of trastuzumab alone could be maintained after chemotherapy,&#xD;
                  but the last dose of trastuzumab should not have been given less than three weeks&#xD;
                  before the first ASCI administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  The patient will not be given trastuzumab during the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. For metastatic patients whose disease is ER+ and/or PR+ the following criteria should&#xD;
             be met:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Patients with visceral disease that requires chemotherapy (eg., patients with&#xD;
                  liver or lung metastases).&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Rapidly progressing or life threatening disease, as determined by the&#xD;
                  investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Patients who received hormonal therapy and are no longer benefiting from this&#xD;
                  therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. A tumor lesion from the patient biopsied before or during screening shows either:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Overexpression of the HER2 protein, as determined by immunohistochemistry (IHC,&#xD;
                  with result IHC 3+) or&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Amplification of the HER2 gene as determined by FISH (at least 4 fold i.e. at&#xD;
                  least 8 copies).&#xD;
&#xD;
             Note: Overexpression/amplification measurements must be performed on a metastatic&#xD;
             lesion in all cases where such a lesion is sufficiently easily accessible. If however&#xD;
             such a biopsy is not possible, then these measurements can be performed on the primary&#xD;
             tumor. Use of the primary tumor is to be documented and justified.&#xD;
&#xD;
             Ten FFPE tissue sections of the tumor on which the HER2 overexpression/amplification&#xD;
             has been done -if available-may be requested. These may be used to retrospectively&#xD;
             carry out part of the translational research (i.e. analysis of EGF receptor activity&#xD;
             and of the presence of immune effector cells, refer to Section 7).&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. The patient has at least one measurable lesion according to RECIST criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. The patient has ECOG status of 0 or 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. The patient has adequate bone marrow reserve as indicated by:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  White blood cell count &gt;/= 3,000/mm3.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Neutrophil count &gt;/= 1,500/mm3.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Platelet count &gt;/= 100,000/mm3.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Hemoglobin levels &gt;/= 10.0 g/dl.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. The patient has adequate renal function as shown by the creatinine levels (i.e. within&#xD;
             the normal range).&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. The patient has adequate hepatic function as shown by serum bilirubin levels i.e:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Serum bilirubin levels within the normal limits.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Both AST and ALT levels &lt;1.5 times the ULN. Note: However, for patients with&#xD;
                  liver metastasis, a serum bilirubin level &lt;1.5 times the ULN and both AST and ALT&#xD;
                  levels &lt;3 times the ULN will be accepted.&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. The patient has a baseline Left Ventricular Ejection Fraction (LVEF) measured by MUGA&#xD;
             scan equal to or greater than the LLN for the radiology facility.&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. If the patient is female, she must be of non-childbearing potential, i.e. have a&#xD;
             current tubal ligation, hysterectomy, ovariectomy or be post-menopausal, or if she is&#xD;
             of childbearing potential, she must practice adequate contraception for 30 days prior&#xD;
             to treatment, have a negative pregnancy test and continue such precautions for two&#xD;
             months after completion of the study treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
             Adequate contraception is defined as a contraceptive method with failure rate of less&#xD;
             than 1% per year when used consistently and correctly (when applicable, as mentioned&#xD;
             in the product label) for example abstinence, combined or progestogen oral&#xD;
             contraceptives, injectable progestogen, implants of levonorgestrel, oestrogenic&#xD;
             vaginal ring, percutaneous contraceptive patches or intrauterine device (IUD) or&#xD;
             intrauterine system (IUS), vasectomy with documented azoospermia of the sole male&#xD;
             partner or double barrier method (condom or occlusive cap plus spermicidal agent).&#xD;
&#xD;
             For azoospermia, &quot;documented&quot; refers to the outcome of the investigator's/ designee's&#xD;
             medical examination of the subject or review of the subject's medical history for&#xD;
             study eligibility, as obtained via a verbal interview with the subject or from the&#xD;
             subject's medical records.&#xD;
&#xD;
             Post-menopause: Menopause is the age associated with complete cessation of menstrual&#xD;
             cycles, menses, and implies the loss of reproductive potential by ovarian failure. A&#xD;
             practical definition accepts menopause after 1 year without menses with an appropriate&#xD;
             clinical profile at the appropriate age e.g. &gt; 45 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
         14. Able to swallow and retain oral medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
         15. In the view of the investigator, the patient can and will comply with the requirements&#xD;
             of the protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
