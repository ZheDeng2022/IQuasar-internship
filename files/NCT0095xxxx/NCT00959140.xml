  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Stem cells collected from sibling donors for allogenic transplants contain various types of&#xD;
      cells. The predominant immune cells are called CD3+ T cells. The amount of these T cells vary&#xD;
      vastly from donor to donor. This study is to determine if standardizing the CD3+ T cell dose&#xD;
      will benefit the recipient (patient). As well as to help discover if dose standardization&#xD;
      causes less variation in outcomes between patients and to make transplantation more&#xD;
      predictable and complications easier to manage.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The optimal CD3+ cell dose to be used for allo HSCT is unknown. In addition, there are&#xD;
      multiple variables in addition to CD3+ cell dose which affect engraftment, immune&#xD;
      reconstitution, GVH and GVL in these patients including recipient age, diagnosis, disease&#xD;
      status at transplantation, donor/recipient tissue type match, preparative regimen, and GVHD&#xD;
      prophylaxis. Thus the ability to produce products with a fixed CD3+ content is critical to&#xD;
      further research and ultimately to the definition of the &quot;right dose&quot; of CD3+ cells for&#xD;
      various clinical situations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who meet eligibility criteria will receive a peripheral blood stem cell product from&#xD;
      their original matched sibling donor engineered to deliver a dose of 3.0+/-0.5 x107 CD3+&#xD;
      cells/kg recipient body weight. Other components of the graft will not be manipulated and the&#xD;
      recipient will receive the total number of cells collected with the exception of minimal&#xD;
      losses that occur during the process of CD3+ T cell isolation.&#xD;

    <description>The peripheral blood stem cell product is engineered to deliver a dose of 15 to 20 x10^7 CD3+ cells/kg recipient body weight. Other components of the graft will not be manipulated and the recipient will receive the total number of cells collected with the exception of minimal losses that occur during the process of CD3+ T cell isolation. Following collection, CD3+ T cells will be enumerated and a portion of the product containing 15 to 20 x10^7 CD 3+ cells/kg will be set aside. The remainder of the product will be depleted of CD3+ T cells.&#xD;
Following CD3+ T cell depletion, the CD3+ T cell depleted product will then be combined with the unmanipulated product to provide the specified levels of CD3+ T cells/kg recipient body-weight. The graft is infused into the patient on the same day as selected and within 24 hours of donor aphaeresis.</description>
