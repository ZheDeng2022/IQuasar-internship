      High Blood Pressure or Hypertension is one of the main causes of stroke, heart disease, heart&#xD;
      attack and kidney disease. Traditionally physicians use diet and lifestyles change and&#xD;
      medications to control patient's blood pressure. There are however, some patients whose blood&#xD;
      pressures are difficult to control and their blood pressure remains elevated despite multiple&#xD;
      medications. When blood pressure remains above goal (greater then 140/90 or greater then&#xD;
      130/80 mmHg in patients with diabetes or kidney disease) despite 3 or more blood pressure&#xD;
      medications, the investigators call it &quot;Resistant Hypertension&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Enhanced External Counterpulsation (EECP) is a new method of treatment currently used in&#xD;
      people with heart disease and chest pain. EECP therapy uses three sets of balloon like cuffs&#xD;
      that are wrapped to the calves, lower thighs, and upper thighs. These cuffs inflate and&#xD;
      deflate with every heart beat, causing increased blood return to the heart and better blood&#xD;
      flow. It has also been found to improve the function of endothelial cells, a type of cells&#xD;
      that lines the wall of blood vessel through out the body which helps to regulate and maintain&#xD;
      blood pressure. This leads us to believe that EECP therapy, although not used at present for&#xD;
      treating patients with Resistant Hypertension, may be useful in decreasing blood pressure.&#xD;

      Hypertension is a major cause and contributor to stroke, heart and kidney disease and could&#xD;
      worsen the progression as well. Despite major reductions in age-adjusted death rates from&#xD;
      coronary heart disease and stroke, these continue to be the leading and third most common&#xD;
      causes of death, respectively, in the United States. In particular, for every 20 mm Hg&#xD;
      increase in systolic blood pressure or 10 mm Hg in diastolic blood pressure, there is a&#xD;
      doubling of stroke and coronary artery disease death rates. Kidney Failure related to&#xD;
      hypertension continues to grow, especially among the African-American population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Traditional approaches have mostly included pharmaceuticals targeting different mechanisms&#xD;
      that contribute to HTN. However, adequate control of Blood pressure continues to remain a&#xD;
      major problem.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Resistant hypertension is defined as blood pressure that remains above goal in spite of the&#xD;
      concurrent use of three antihypertensive agents of different classes. Ideally, one of the&#xD;
      three agents should be a diuretic and all agents should be prescribed at optimal dose&#xD;
      amounts. Patients whose blood pressure is controlled but require four or more medications to&#xD;
      do so should be considered resistant to treatment. The prevalence of resistant hypertension&#xD;
      is unknown. Cross- sectional studies and hypertension outcome studies suggest, however, that&#xD;
      it is not uncommon. In a recent analysis of National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey&#xD;
      (NHANES) participants being treated for hypertension, only 53% were controlled to &lt;140/90 mm&#xD;
      Hg. In a cross-sectional analysis of Framingham Heart Study participants, only 48% of treated&#xD;
      participants were controlled to &lt;140/90 mm Hg and less than 40% of elderly participants (&gt;75&#xD;
      years of age) were at a goal blood pressure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The benefits of successful treatment, however, are likely substantial as suggested by&#xD;
      hypertension outcome studies in general and by the early Veterans Administration cooperative&#xD;
      studies, which demonstrated a 96% reduction in cardiovascular events over 18 months with use&#xD;
      of triple antihypertensive regimens compared with placebo in patients with severe&#xD;
      hypertension (diastolic blood pressure 115 to 129 mm Hg).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Furthermore, as age and obesity are the two most common risk factors for hypertension the&#xD;
      prevalence will likely increase as the patient population gets older and heavier. This&#xD;
      necessitates development of novel therapeutic approaches to blood pressure control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Enhanced External Counterpulsation (EECP) is a non-invasive method currently used for the&#xD;
      treatment of ischemic coronary disease. During EECP therapy three compressive pneumatic cuffs&#xD;
      are wrapped to the calves, lower thighs, and upper thighs. The cuffs inflated sequentially&#xD;
      during diastole cause retrograde aortic flow, and increased venous return. During end&#xD;
      diastole, the cuffs rapidly deflate, resulting in unloading of the left ventricle and a&#xD;
      decrease in systolic blood pressure. In addition there is also evidence that EECP improves&#xD;
      endothelial function. Endothelial dysfunction with imbalance of vasodilatory and vasoactive&#xD;
      substance is thought to contribute to elevated blood pressure. This leads us believe that&#xD;
      EECP, although not used at present for patients with Resistant HTN, may represent a novel,&#xD;
      valuable and untapped therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We propose to study the effect of EECP therapy on mean ambulatory blood pressure and&#xD;
      noninvasive hemodynamics in subjects with Resistant HTN. We will measure subjects' ambulatory&#xD;
      blood pressure and noninvasive hemodynamics parameters at baseline, 4 weeks and 7 weeks.&#xD;
      Subjects will undergo a 7 week course (35 sessions) of EECP therapy. Follow up ambulatory BP&#xD;
      and non invasive hemodynamic parameters will be measured to evaluate any change in BP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our hypothesis is that in patients with Resistant HTN will demonstrate improved Blood&#xD;
      pressure after completion of 35 sessions of EECP therapy.&#xD;
