      The purpose of this study is to determine whether NK012 is safe and effective in the&#xD;
      treatment of relapsed small cell lung cancer.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase II, open label, single arm, multicenter study of NK012 in patients with&#xD;
      sensitive relapsed SCLC (at least 90 days since first line therapy) or refractory relapsed&#xD;
      SCLC (&lt; 90 days since first line therapy). NK012 will be administered by intravenous infusion&#xD;
      over 30 minutes once every 28 days (on Day 1 of each cycle). Patients will be screened for&#xD;
      UGT1A1 polymorphism prior to enrollment.&#xD;

    <description>30 minute IV infusion once every 28 days. NK012 dose is 28 mg/m^2 (or 18 mg/m^2 depending on UGT1A1 polymorphism, with potential to dose escalate). Dose escalation cannot exceed 28 mg/m^2. Dosing will proceed until progression or unacceptable toxicity develops, or decision by patient or investigator to stop.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Histologically or cytologically confirmed diagnosis of SCLC, which has relapsed after&#xD;
             first line chemotherapy for extensive-stage SCLC or first-line chemoradiotherapy for&#xD;
             limited-stage SCLC.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Have received one, and only one, prior chemotherapy or chemoradiotherapy regimen for&#xD;
             either newly diagnosed extensive-stage disease or limited-stage disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Prior therapies must be completed at least 4 weeks prior to enrollment and patients&#xD;
             must have recovered from all acute toxicities.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Measurable disease by RECIST.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. ECOG performance status of 0-2.&#xD;

             or equal to 60 mL/min (Cockcroft-Gault formula) for patients with serum creatinine&#xD;
             levels &gt; 1.5 x ULN.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Able to understand and show willingness to sign a written informed consent document.&#xD;
