      RATIONALE: Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to kill tumor cells. Drugs used in&#xD;
      chemotherapy, such as cisplatin, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells,&#xD;
      either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Monoclonal antibodies, such as&#xD;
      cetuximab, can block tumor growth in different ways. Some block the ability of tumor cells to&#xD;
      grow and spread. Others find tumor cells and help kill them or carry tumor-killing substances&#xD;
      to them. It is not yet known whether radiation therapy given together with cisplatin is more&#xD;
      effective with or without cetuximab in treating patients with cervical cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE: This randomized phase II trial is studying giving radiation therapy together with&#xD;
      cisplatin to see how well it works compared with radiation therapy and cisplatin given&#xD;
      together with cetuximab in treating patients with stage IB, stage II, or stage IIIB cervical&#xD;
      cancer.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluate the efficacy of treatment with cetuximab and a standard radiochemotherapy&#xD;
           regimen (pelvic radiotherapy and cisplatin) in patients with stage IB2, II, and IIIB&#xD;
           cervical cancer by evaluating the number of patients without recurrence at 2 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Analyze the tumor response by MRI after external radiotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Assess the tolerance of cetuximab and standard radiochemotherapy in patients not&#xD;
           previously treated and in generally good condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Study the correlation between treatment response and analysis of EGFR mutations (exons&#xD;
           18-21 of the tyrosine kinase domain including the two hot spots L858R and E746-A750).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Study the correlation between treatment response and evaluation of number of copies of&#xD;
           the EGFR gene.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Study the correlation between treatment response and analysis of mutations of codons 12&#xD;
           and 13 of KRAS2 by direct sequencing.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Study the correlation between treatment response and research of DNA sequences of human&#xD;
           papillomavirus.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Study the correlation between treatment response and overexpression of EGFR and COX2&#xD;
           (centralized) by IHC.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Study the correlation between treatment response and characterization of a genomic&#xD;
           signature (genome, transcriptome, and Affymetrix chips from samples frozen in liquid&#xD;
           nitrogen).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Collect tumor samples for molecular analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to planned surgery&#xD;
      (yes vs no) and are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Arm I: Patients receive cisplatin IV over 1 hour once weekly during weeks 1-6. Patients&#xD;
           also undergo pelvic radiotherapy 5 days a week during weeks 2-5 or 2-6.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Arm II: Patients receive cisplatin and undergo radiotherapy as in arm I. Patients also&#xD;
           receive cetuximab IV over 1 hour once weekly during weeks 1-6.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After 6-8 weeks of study treatment, patients continue treatment as recommended by their&#xD;
      center (i.e., utero-vaginal brachytherapy, additional radiotherapy, or surgery).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tumor tissue and blood samples are collected for further analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed at 3-4 weeks and then every 4&#xD;
      months for 2 years.&#xD;
