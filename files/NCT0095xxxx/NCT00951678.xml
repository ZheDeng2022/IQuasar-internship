  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Central venous catheterization is a common and important procedure done in the emergency&#xD;
      department. The internal jugular vein (IJV), subclavian vein (SV) and femoral vein (FV) are&#xD;
      commonly used for central venous access. Unfortunately, this procedure has high-risk&#xD;
      complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Traditionally, physicians have relied on the use of anatomic landmarks and physical&#xD;
      manipulation such as moving the head or rotating the leg in order to place central catheters;&#xD;
      however, studies have demonstrated that significant anatomic variations exist within large&#xD;
      percentages of study populations. In addition, although studies have demonstrated that the&#xD;
      use of ultrasonography for placement of femoral catheters leads to lower rates of&#xD;
      complications, no previous studies have specifically determined anatomic variations in the&#xD;
      femoral triangle. Therefore, this study will examine the anatomic variation of the IJV vs.&#xD;
      carotid artery and the femoral vein vs. femoral artery in the emergency room setting. The&#xD;
      investigators will study the variation as a function of sex, age, race, body habitus and&#xD;
      degree of head rotation (measured using a goniometer) and in doing so, the investigators will&#xD;
      demonstrate the utility of using ultrasound to place central lines in order to decrease&#xD;
      morbidity.&#xD;
