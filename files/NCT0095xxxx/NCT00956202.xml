  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to generate data on immunogenicity and safety of the monovalent&#xD;
      H1N1 vaccine in support of the development and registration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To describe the immune response to vaccines 21 days after each vaccination in all&#xD;
           participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To describe the antibody persistence eight months after the first vaccine administration&#xD;
           using HAI method, in a subset of participants who received two injections.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To describe the immune response against the A/H1N1 strain using HAI method 21 days after&#xD;
           a vaccination with the 2010-2011 NH seasonal TIV administered approximately 13 months&#xD;
           after the first vaccination in the subset of participants who received two injections.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To describe the safety profile of each vaccine in all participants.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All participants will receive two injections of their randomized vaccine on Day 0 and Day 21,&#xD;
      respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A subset of children and adolescents participants eligible for the antibody persistence&#xD;
      evaluation were sampled 8 months after the first vaccination, they will also be proposed to&#xD;
      receive the 2010-2011 Northern Hemisphere (NH) seasonal Trivalent Influenza Vaccine (TIV) 13&#xD;
      months after the first vaccination. Immunogenicity response will be evaluated before&#xD;
      vaccination and 21 days after vaccination with TIV, respectively.&#xD;
