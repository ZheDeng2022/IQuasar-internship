      The trial aims to test a novel rehabilitation device for subacute stroke hemiplegic upper&#xD;
      limbs based on state-of-the-art non invasive Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) robotic&#xD;
      rehabilitation in a clinical setting. The investigators aim to prove the clinical efficacy&#xD;
      and safety of BCI therapy over traditional rehabilitation methods.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The proposed rehabilitation device is the first neuro-rehabilitation system which combines&#xD;
      non-invasive BCI and robotic rehabilitation for the paralysed stroke upper extremity within 6&#xD;
      months of stroke.Spontaneous recovery after stroke takes place over the first 6-12 months&#xD;
      after stroke. The first 3-6 months are the most crucial periods as this is the period of&#xD;
      maximal neurological recovery and neuroplasticity. Differential rates of recovery occur for&#xD;
      various types of impairments post-stroke. In general, motor functions (mobility, walking,&#xD;
      upper limb function, activities of daily living (ADL)) recover faster than cognitive or&#xD;
      language impairments which may recover over 12 months. A number of approaches to stroke&#xD;
      injury rehabilitation have been introduced to facilitate intrinsic recovery or aid adaptive&#xD;
      compensation for stroke-related impairments. Generally for rehabilitative training to be&#xD;
      effective, it must be commenced as early as possible after stroke. Current research proves&#xD;
      that rehabilitation using traditional neuro-facilitation approaches is effective in improving&#xD;
      neurological and functional recovery and is superior to no treatment or nursing care alone.&#xD;
      Rehabilitated patients have shorter total hospitalization stays, lower complication rates,&#xD;
      earlier and higher rates of discharge home than patients who do not receive rehabilitation.&#xD;
      In addition, rehabilitation involving a multidisciplinary team approach led by rehabilitation&#xD;
      physician or specialist result in better functional outcomes compared to acute general&#xD;
      ward-based therapies. In order for rehabilitation to be effective in modifying cortical&#xD;
      neuroplasticity, it must be targeted at the specific stroke impairment, task specific,&#xD;
      exercise must be repetitive and intensive, goal directed and command the attention of the&#xD;
      stroke patient. Some of the components of rehabilitation include physical therapy, gait and&#xD;
      balance training, aerobic conditioning, functional Activities of Daily Living (ADL) training,&#xD;
      physical modalities to treat pain, Functional Electrical Stimulation (FES) or Neuro-Muscular&#xD;
      Electrical Stimulation (NMES). Other methods include specific treatments to address&#xD;
      complications of rehabilitation such as spasticity, ataxia, contractures and bladder or bowel&#xD;
      incontinence. Often, one-to-one and highly labour-intensive and expensive therapies with&#xD;
      close hand-over-hand treatments are required. Limitations of current physiotherapy and&#xD;
      occupational therapy techniques include the following:(1) Difficulties in rehabilitation for&#xD;
      the severely paralysed arm and hand which are often treated with passive modalities such as&#xD;
      NMES, passive ROMs and other modalities. (2) Difficulties in achieving intensive&#xD;
      rehabilitation and high repetitions in those with moderate to severe upper extremity&#xD;
      paralysis either due to non participation or pain which is commoner in those with severe&#xD;
      paralysis. (3)Problems in motivating and sustaining patient interest in repetitive&#xD;
      exercises.(4)Therapy is often perceived to be boring and due to lack of immediate&#xD;
      biofeedback. (I) Robot Aided Rehabilitation: MIT (USA) has developed a robot, named the&#xD;
      MIT-MANUS, to aid therapy of stroke victims. Small clinical trials have reported that the&#xD;
      robot significantly improved patients' recovery of arm motor movement and function with&#xD;
      sustained gains several months after cessation of treatment. This system is being clinically&#xD;
      used as a rehabilitation training tool in over 20 centres world-wide. Advantages of robot&#xD;
      aided rehabilitation include the ability to document and store motion and force parameters,&#xD;
      the ability to achieve thousands of repetitions per treatment session (100 times more than&#xD;
      conventional treatment or FES) without causing tissue injury or pain, high intensity with low&#xD;
      friction, attention training and increased biofeedback through the incorporation of&#xD;
      interactive video games, which can simulate trajectories, mazes, ADL tasks such as preparing&#xD;
      a meal and spatial task simulation such as going shopping. In addition, after the initial&#xD;
      training period, supervision of the patient by the therapist can be reduced due to the&#xD;
      sustainability of participation of the patient from the robot or BCI based Robotic&#xD;
      Rehabilitation. Hence, productivity of the human therapist is increased by the robot. The&#xD;
      robot thus acts as a high technology aid to the clinician and therapist. The system is also&#xD;
      portable, giving rise to the possibility of tele-rehabilitation options with the performance&#xD;
      and progress of the patient being monitored by the institution remotely. (II)BCI-based BCI&#xD;
      based Robotic Rehabilitation:This non invasive device aims to use a novel approach in robotic&#xD;
      training, which has not been employed in the therapeutic realm before.In the MIT-MANUS and&#xD;
      related commercially available systems, there is no direct communication between the&#xD;
      patient's mind or thinking processes or motor volitional thinking and the robotic system.&#xD;
      Although some sensors are used to detect the patient's weak movement, it never knows when and&#xD;
      how the patient wants to move. The robot arm to which the patient is tethered or constrained&#xD;
      plans the trajectory of movement for the patient and reduces its active role as the patient&#xD;
      recovers voluntary motion. In most times, the patient can only passively follow the&#xD;
      predefined program, which may not fully explore the patient's motor initiatives and potential&#xD;
      or attention processes.&#xD;
