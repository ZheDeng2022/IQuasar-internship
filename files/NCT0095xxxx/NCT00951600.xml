    <textblock>
      The study was conducted as an open label, balanced, randomized, two-treatment, two-period,&#xD;
      two-sequence, single- dose, crossover bioavailability study comparing oxcarbazepine 300&#xD;
      mg/5mL oral suspension of OHM Laboratories (a subsidiary of Ranbaxy Pharmaceuticals Inc.)&#xD;
      with Trileptal® 300 mg/5mL oral suspension (containing oxcarbazepine 300 mg/5mL) of Novartis&#xD;
      Pharmaceutical Corporation in healthy, adult, male, human subjects under fasting conditions.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Following an overnight fast of at least 10 hours, a single dose of 10 mL of oxcarbazepine 300&#xD;
      mg/5 mL oral suspension (containing oxcarbazepine 300 mg/5rnL) was administered using a 10 mL&#xD;
      graduated syringe, during each period of the study under the supervision of trained study&#xD;
      personnel, along with 240 mL of drinking water at ambient temperature.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the course of the study safety parameters assessed were vital signs, clinical&#xD;
      examination, medical history and clinical laboratory safety tests (hematology, biochemical&#xD;
      parameters, serology and urine analysis) at baseline. Laboratory parameters of hematology and&#xD;
      biochemistry were repeated at the end of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of forty (40) subjects were administered a single oral dose of the test or reference&#xD;
      formulation of 10 mL of oxcarbazepine 300 mg/5 mL oral suspension (containing oxcarbazepine&#xD;
      300 mg/5mL) according to a randomization schedule. Thirty-five (35) subjects completed both&#xD;
      the periods of the study.&#xD;
