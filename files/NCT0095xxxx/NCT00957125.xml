  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with localized primary breast cancer including inflammatory breast cancer suitable&#xD;
      for primary medical treatment and/or regional lymph node metastases receive six cycles of&#xD;
      chemotherapy with epirubicin and docetaxel. Treatment evaluations are performed after the&#xD;
      second, fourth and sixth cycle. In case of SD/PR after the second course, bevacizumab is&#xD;
      added to the combination for the remaining four courses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Besides standard response evaluation clinically and by mammography and ultrasound, several&#xD;
      functional imaging techniques including MR, CT-PET and contrast-enhanced ultrasound are&#xD;
      investigated. Fresh tumor tissue samples from the primary tumor are collected before start,&#xD;
      after two courses and in connection with surgery. The aim of the trial is to detect&#xD;
      biological factors and functional imaging techniques with the ability to predict response at&#xD;
      an early stage of treatment.&#xD;

      Primary endpoints: Objective response (OR) characterized by conventional radiological and&#xD;
      functional imaging procedures and biological tumour markers at an early point of treatment&#xD;
      with epirubicin + docetaxel and effects of addition of bevacizumab as reflected by these&#xD;
      procedures. Early functional and biological changes signalling pathological complete response&#xD;
      (pCR). Secondary endpoints: Secondary endpoints: Morphological and biological changes of&#xD;
      tumours exposed for cytotoxic and targeted treatment. Disease-free survival. Safety.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evaluations:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before start of treatment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tumour staging: Bone scan, chest X-ray and liver ultrasound or CT scan of chest and abdomen&#xD;
      within four weeks before start of treatment. Physical examination, conventional radiology&#xD;
      (ultrasound and mammography including pre-treatment localization with carbon suspension) and&#xD;
      functional imaging procedure (MRI or PET-CT or Contrast-Enhanced Ultrasound (CEUS) or&#xD;
      Scintigraphy with 99m-Tc-HMPAO (Ceretec)) within two weeks before start of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood samples (SNP, metabolomics, M-30 assay, TK/XPA-210 assay, angiogenesis markers, TIMP-1,&#xD;
      tissue factor) and tumour biopsies (transcriptomics, proteomics, IHC-stroma, AMOT) are&#xD;
      collected within two weeks before start of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During treatment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physical examination before start of each treatment. Imaging procedures: Mammography,&#xD;
      ultrasound (compulsory) one week (5-9 days) after cycles 2, 4 and 6. MRI, PET-CT,&#xD;
      Contrast-Enhanced Ultrasound (CEUS) applied according to availability at the participating&#xD;
      sites, one week (5-9 days) after cycles 2 and 4.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tumour markers: Blood samples (proteomics, metabolomics, M-30 assay, TK/XPA-210 assay,&#xD;
      angiogenesis markers, TIMP-1, tissue factor) are collected 48 hours after cycles 1 thru 4.&#xD;
      Tumour tissue (transcriptomics, proteomics, IHC-stroma, AMOT) is taken charge of by biopsy&#xD;
      one week (5-9 days) after cycle 2 and from the tumour specimen in connection with surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Totally, 150-200 patients with measurable/evaluable primary breast cancer are planned for&#xD;
      inclusion within a period of two years time. For each imaging method, approximately 40-50&#xD;
      patients will be included. The study is designed to find early predictors of response by&#xD;
      testing a set-up of several different molecular and imaging tools. In addition, for each&#xD;
      method changes of patterns occurring during treatment will be compared to baseline findings&#xD;
      and, in the case of functional imaging, standard imaging procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will be followed for five years after operation with regard to outcome and&#xD;
      toxicity.&#xD;
