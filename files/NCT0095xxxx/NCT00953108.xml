  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In former studies of the investigators research group the investigators could also&#xD;
      demonstrate acute inhibitory effects of the antidepressant mirtazapine on ACTH and cortisol&#xD;
      release in normal controls (Schüle et al. 2002), most likely mediated via antagonism at&#xD;
      central 5-HT2- and H1-receptors. In contrast to mirtazapine, serotonin or norepinephrine&#xD;
      reuptake inhibiting antidepressants acutely stimulate ACTH and cortisol secretion (Schüle&#xD;
      2007). The investigators also performed a study in depressed patients who were treated either&#xD;
      with mirtazapine or with reboxetine using serial dexamethasone/CRH tests (week 0, 1, and 5)&#xD;
      as a parameter for HPA axis activity. Mirtazapine, but not the norepinephrine reuptake&#xD;
      inhibitor reboxetine was able to significantly reduce HPA axis activity already within one&#xD;
      week (Schüle et al. 2006). Mirtazapine is known to have an earlier onset of antidepressant&#xD;
      action than do SSRIs such as sertraline (Behnke et al. 2003) or antidepressants with dual&#xD;
      mechanism of action such as venlafaxine (Benkert et al. 2006), possibly due to its rapid&#xD;
      inhibition of HPA axis activity in unipolar depressed patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since mirtazapine and quetiapine have similar effects on the HPA system in healthy male&#xD;
      volunteers (i.e. inhibition of ACTH and cortisol secretion), a rapid attenuation of HPA axis&#xD;
      activity is also expected during quetiapine XR treatment in depressed patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, in the present study the investigators goal is to investigate whether quetiapine&#xD;
      fumarate XR at a dosage of 300 mg per day has an impact on HPA axis activity in unipolar&#xD;
      depressed patients, as measured by serial dexamethasone/CRH tests (week 0, 1, and 5) and&#xD;
      salivary cortisol profiles and whether putative effects of quetiapine XR on the HPA system&#xD;
      are related to its antidepressant efficacy.&#xD;
