      The investigators' goal is to identify the mutation in the gene that is responsible for the&#xD;
      development of segmental dysplastic nevi. To identify the gene the investigators may use a&#xD;
      candidate gene approach (i.e. sequence specific genes that are thought to be involved: NRAS,&#xD;
      BRAF, etc) or a genome-wide approach trying to implicate regions in the genome&#xD;
      (Loss-of-heterozygosity or copy number changes on comparative genomic hybridization).&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Dysplastic (atypical) melanocytic (DMN) nevi have been identified as being potential&#xD;
      precursors of melanoma and markers for patients at risk of developing primary melanoma1. In&#xD;
      addition, having an increased number of nevi is associated with increased risk1. DMN are&#xD;
      present in 2-5% of white adults in the U.S. population and international studies have&#xD;
      documented up to 18% prevalence2. These lesions may be present in at least 17% of white&#xD;
      adults with melanoma and 20-50% of melanomas may arise in nevi and atypical nevi2. The exact&#xD;
      gene(s) involved in the development of nevi have yet to be elucidated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Segmental dysplastic nevi are nevi that are restricted to one area of the body3. This&#xD;
      condition is much rarer than the occurrence of dysplastic nevi, but nonetheless, may involve&#xD;
      the same genetic mutation. The pattern of distribution in SDN is thought to result from&#xD;
      mosaicism, i.e. the part of the body that expresses the dysplastic nevi has a mutation in a&#xD;
      gene, however, the rest of the body does not contain this same mutation. Other mosaic&#xD;
      disorders that have been studied in greater detail than SDN have been shown to be caused by a&#xD;
      single gene mutation4. It appears that SDN is no different and that it too is caused by a&#xD;
      mutation in a single gene, however, this gene is not yet known.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study we will perform a genetic analysis of tissue from a patient known to have SDN.&#xD;
      With the information we gather from this analysis, we may be able to find the gene&#xD;
      responsible for the development of dysplastic nevi.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Research Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To investigate the genetic mutation involved in the development of dysplastic nevi by&#xD;
      examining a patient with SDN.&#xD;
