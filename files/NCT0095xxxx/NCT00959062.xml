  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Almost all critically ill children who are mechanically ventilated require sedation and&#xD;
      analgesia. Providing effective sedation for children in the PICU requires careful balancing&#xD;
      of the need for sedation with the adverse effects associated with sedative medications.&#xD;
      Clonidine is often used as an adjunctive sedative and analgesic in children but a well&#xD;
      designed and adequately powered randomized trial is required to test the effect of&#xD;
      clonidine-based sedation. Because there are no large randomized trials of sedation related&#xD;
      interventions among critically ill children there are many unknown factors. This pilot trial,&#xD;
      focussing on feasibility outcomes will assess the feasibility of, and inform the design of, a&#xD;
      larger randomized controlled trial which will focus on clinically important outcomes.&#xD;

      Almost all critically ill children who are mechanically ventilated require sedation and&#xD;
      analgesia. Providing effective sedation for children in the PICU requires careful balancing&#xD;
      of the need for sedation with the adverse effects associated with sedative medications.&#xD;
      Inadequate sedation may result in undue pain and suffering for children, ventilator&#xD;
      dysynchrony and may risk removal of life sustaining devices. Excess sedation limits patients'&#xD;
      interaction with their parents and care-givers and may result in delayed weaning from&#xD;
      mechanical ventilation, prolonged PICU stay and the attendant risks of increased morbidity.&#xD;
      Critically ill children may also experience withdrawal when these medications are stopped.&#xD;
      Randomized trails in adults have shown that sedation related interventions can improve&#xD;
      patients outcomes, but such trials have not been performed in children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clonidine is often used as an adjunctive sedative and analgesic in children but a well&#xD;
      designed and adequately powered randomized trial is required to test the effect of&#xD;
      clonidine-based sedation. Because there are no large randomized trials of sedation related&#xD;
      interventions among critically ill children there are many unknown factors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This pilot trial, focussing on feasibility outcomes will assess the feasibility of, and&#xD;
      inform the design of, a larger randomized controlled trial which will focus on clinically&#xD;
      important outcomes.&#xD;
