  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to determine the safety of mucosal immune responses to a DNA HIV&#xD;
      vaccine followed by an adenoviral vector HIV vaccine in HIV uninfected adults.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The worldwide HIV/AIDS epidemic may only be controlled through development of a safe and&#xD;
      effective vaccine that will prevent HIV infection. DNA vaccines are inexpensive to construct,&#xD;
      readily produced in large quantities, and stable for long periods of time. This study will&#xD;
      evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of an experimental multiclade HIV vaccine,&#xD;
      VRC-HIVDNA016-00-VP, followed by a similarly structured adenovirus-vectored vaccine boost,&#xD;
      VRC-HIVADV014-00-VP, in HIV uninfected adults. The DNA plasmids in both the vaccines code for&#xD;
      proteins from HIV subtypes A, B, and C, which together represent 90% of new HIV infections in&#xD;
      the world. The study's primary objective is to investigate the ability of a 6-plasmid DNA&#xD;
      prime followed by a rAd5 boost to elicit HIV-specific cellular immune responses at mucosal&#xD;
      surfaces.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will last 12 months and participants will visit the clinic 15 times. Participants&#xD;
      will receive three injections of the VRC-HIVDNA016-00-VP vaccine at Months 0, 1, and 2&#xD;
      followed by an injection of VRC-HIVADV014-00-VP at Month 6. All injections will be given in&#xD;
      the upper arm. At study visits participants will have a physical, medical history taken,&#xD;
      blood collection, and risk reduction counseling. At some visits, rectal biopsies (via&#xD;
      anoscopy or, optionally, by flexible sigmoidoscopy), saliva, semen, cervical and/or vaginal&#xD;
      fluid samples will also be collected. Pregnancy testing for women will be done prior to each&#xD;
      vaccination and study procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be contacted by study staff once a year for 5 years after the initial study&#xD;
      visit for follow-up health and safety monitoring.&#xD;
