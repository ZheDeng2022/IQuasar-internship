      This study will be conducted in healthy male or female subjects using a double-blind,&#xD;
      randomized, placebo-controlled, single-dose design. Up to 30 subjects will be enrolled; 3&#xD;
      healthy subjects in Cohorts 1 and 2 (2 active, 1 placebo) and 8 healthy subjects in Cohorts 3&#xD;
      to 5 (6 active, 2 placebo). The following CPSI-2364 doses are proposed: 1 mg, 10 mg, 30 mg,&#xD;
      90 mg, and 270 mg.Safety will be evaluated throughout the study and include physical&#xD;
      examinations, vital signs assessments, 12-lead electrocardiograms (ECGs), routine clinical&#xD;
      laboratory tests (including blood chemistry, hematology, coagulation, and urinalysis), and&#xD;
      adverse event (AE) assessments. Vital sign assessments and 12-lead ECGs will be performed&#xD;
      repeatedly over the 24-hour observation period. Venous blood samples will be taken at&#xD;
      specified intervals and tested for the presence of CPSI-2364.&#xD;

      This study will be conducted in healthy male or female subjects using a double-blind,&#xD;
      randomized, placebo-controlled, single-dose design. Up to 30 subjects will be enrolled; 3&#xD;
      healthy subjects in Cohorts 1 and 2 (2 active, 1 placebo) and 8 healthy subjects in Cohorts 3&#xD;
      to 5 (6 active, 2 placebo). The following CPSI-2364 doses are proposed: 1 mg, 10 mg, 30 mg,&#xD;
      90 mg, and 270 mg. In Cohort 1 (1 mg) and Cohort 2 (10 mg), the three subjects will all be&#xD;
      dosed on the same day, with at least 60 minute intervals between dosing. In Cohorts 3 to 5,&#xD;
      the first two subjects of each cohort (one active, one placebo) will receive their drug on&#xD;
      the same day with at least a 60-minute interval between dosing, with the remainder of the&#xD;
      cohort being dosed the next day once these subjects have been assessed. Safety labs, physical&#xD;
      examination findings, and adverse events available up to and including Day 5 data of each&#xD;
      cohort will be reviewed by the Investigator, the Study Manager, and the Sponsor (or designee)&#xD;
      in order to determine the progression of dose escalation. Subjects will not be enrolled in&#xD;
      the next higher cohort until the dose in the preceding cohort is deemed safe and tolerable.&#xD;
      Doses will continue to be escalated in subsequent groups until a maximum tolerated dose (MTD)&#xD;
      is reached, or until a top dose of 270 mg is reached, whichever is sooner. Intermediate and&#xD;
      repeat dose levels may be administered in addition to or in place of the planned dose levels,&#xD;
      if it is deemed appropriate to increase the safety or scientific value of this Phase 1&#xD;
      exploratory study.Safety will be evaluated throughout the study and include physical&#xD;
      examinations, vital signs assessments, 12-lead electrocardiograms (ECGs), routine clinical&#xD;
      laboratory tests (including blood chemistry, hematology, coagulation, and urinalysis), and&#xD;
      adverse event (AE) assessments. Vital sign assessments and 12-lead ECGs will be performed&#xD;
      repeatedly over the 24-hour observation period.Venous blood samples will be taken at&#xD;
      specified intervals and tested for the presence of CPSI-2364.&#xD;
