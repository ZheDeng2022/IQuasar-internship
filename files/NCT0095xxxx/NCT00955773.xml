      The purpose of this study is to determine the recommended dose and regimen for the orally&#xD;
      administered MEK inhibitor GSK1120212 dosed in combination with everolimus in subjects with&#xD;
      solid tumors. The escalation part of the study will determine the MTD. The combination will&#xD;
      be further explored in the expansion part in subjects with metastatic pancreatic cancer. In&#xD;
      addition, subjects with KRAS mutant non-small cell lung cancer will be enrolled.&#xD;

      MEK112110 is a dose-escalation, open-label study to determine the recommended dose and&#xD;
      regimen for the orally administered MEK inhibitor GSK1120212 dosed in combination with&#xD;
      everolimus in subjects with solid tumors. This will be accomplished using a dose-escalation&#xD;
      procedure starting at low doses of GSK1120212 and everolimus. Dose escalation will continue&#xD;
      based on predefined parameters until the maximum tolerated dose is identified. The&#xD;
      recommended doses and regimens will be selected based on the safety and pharmacokinetic&#xD;
      profiles. The clinical activity of GSK1120212 dosed in combination with everolimus will be&#xD;
      explored further in an expansion cohort consisting of 20 subjects with metastatic pancreatic&#xD;
      cancer. In addition a substudy will be conducted in 40 subjects with KRAS-mutant non-small&#xD;
      cell lung cancer.&#xD;
