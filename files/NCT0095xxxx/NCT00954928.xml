  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      If operating on the anticoagulated patient has been safe for one of the investigators'&#xD;
      surgeons for the past 10 years then providing prospective data that substantiates this could&#xD;
      prevent complications related to the discontinuation of anticoagulation for hand surgery&#xD;
      patients in the future.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All eligible patients will be offered study enrollment pre-operatively. Demographic data&#xD;
      collected during clinical interaction that will be gathered for research purposes and will&#xD;
      included patient height, weight, age, anticoagulant medication(s) used with dosage/duration&#xD;
      of use, indication for anticoagulant medication, and current INR if on warfarin. Preoperative&#xD;
      examination will include measures of 2 point discrimination in the digits, distance of the&#xD;
      fingertips from the distal palmar crease upon flexion, and the patient-based outcome surveys&#xD;
      that are to be collected after surgery (Quick DASH, SF-12, Visual Analog Scales&#xD;
      pain/swelling). These patients will then undergo the appropriate surgical procedure without&#xD;
      discontinuing their anticoagulant medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To ensure that patients are not being placed at increased risk, this study's protocol will&#xD;
      not alter the surgical practices of the attending surgeons involved. Specifically, all&#xD;
      surgeons perform their hand and wrist surgery under tourniquet control but differ in whether&#xD;
      the tourniquet is deflated prior to wound closure. Each surgeon will be free to manage the&#xD;
      tourniquet as they feel appropriate. The placement of would drains will remain at the&#xD;
      discretion of the attending surgeon on a case-by-case basis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Local anesthetics may be injected but none will be mixed with epinephrine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedures: (if applicable) Obtaining pre-operative INR values when appropriate, and&#xD;
      performing surgery while continuing anticoagulants is already standard care for one faculty&#xD;
      member. All post-operative care except the completion of the Quick DASH and Short Form 12,&#xD;
      and visual analog ratings is part of standard clinical care. Research questionnaires should&#xD;
      take no more than 20 minutes to complete per visit.&#xD;
