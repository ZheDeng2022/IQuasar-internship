    <textblock>
      Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) therapy has proven to lead to symptom improvement in&#xD;
      many individuals with major depressive disorder (MDD), yet there is heterogeneity in outcome,&#xD;
      with some patients showing robust remission and other showing minimal symptom change.&#xD;
      Identifying which individuals are likely to benefit from TMS therapy early in the course of&#xD;
      treatment would support continued treatment for those predicted to do well, and consideration&#xD;
      of alternative treatments for others individuals. This study will test specific hypotheses&#xD;
      about the relationships between early neurophysiologic changes and later clinical outcome&#xD;
      with TMS treatment.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      A critical challenge in the management of major depressive disorder (MDD) is the selection of&#xD;
      treatment for each individual patient. Although treatments with depression can restore&#xD;
      people's lives, with any treatment modality there are some individuals who do not achieve&#xD;
      complete remission of symptoms, whether the intervention is pharmacological, psychological,&#xD;
      or somatic. While predictors for some treatments have been proposed for groups of patients,&#xD;
      the translation of these predictors to individualized patient care has remained elusive. In&#xD;
      an analysis of data from the NCT 00104611 multi-site, randomized, sham-controlled trial of&#xD;
      TMS, it was found that a larger number of prior treatment failures, longer duration of the&#xD;
      current episode, and the presence of comorbid anxiety were individual patient characteristics&#xD;
      associated with poorer acute outcomes with TMS treatment in the randomized period (Lisanby et&#xD;
      al., in press). This publication did not report standard predictor metrics (e.g.,&#xD;
      sensitivity, specificity, positive- or negative-predictive accuracy, ROC curves), so it is&#xD;
      difficult to assess the value of these clinical factors in treatment planning for individual&#xD;
      patients. A predictor that could distinguish between individuals likely to remit with TMS&#xD;
      versus those likely to need a different intervention would be of great use to clinicians and&#xD;
      patients in making treatment decisions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our prior work (Cook et al., 2001, 2002, 2005; Leuchter et al. 2002) has studied a new&#xD;
      physiologic biomarker of response to SSRI and mixed-action antidepressants. The EEG-based&#xD;
      cordance biomarker can detect the physiologic effects of successful antidepressant treatment&#xD;
      at 48 hours, 1 week, and 2 weeks of treatment; in contrast, symptom differences between&#xD;
      responders and non-responders did not separate until 4 weeks of treatment in our&#xD;
      placebo-controlled trials. Additionally, the magnitude of early physiologic change was&#xD;
      associated with the completeness of clinical response. Our biomarker has been independently&#xD;
      studied and our findings replicated (Kopecek et al., 2006; Bareš et al., 2007, 2008). The&#xD;
      cordance biomarker can be considered as a leading indicator or predictor of treatment&#xD;
      outcome. As a non-invasive probe of brain physiology, it may detect early neurophysiologic&#xD;
      changes associated with accelerated clinical response from TMS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      More recent work with a related EEG-based measure, the Antidepressant Treatment Response&#xD;
      Index (ATR) has led to a simplified monitoring system; a physician can record&#xD;
      clinically-useful data from a 15-minute in-office procedure with electrodes located on the&#xD;
      forehead and ears (Leuchter et al., in submission). The ATR uses physiologic data collected&#xD;
      prior to treatment and after one week of exposure, and was shown to be predictive of outcome&#xD;
      with antidepressant medication. We are able to assess both cordance and ATR measures with EEG&#xD;
      measurements made prior to treatment and after 5 treatment sessions with TMS to evaluate the&#xD;
      predictive properties of both metrics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On a related issue, some of the variation in outcome may be related to treatment factors.&#xD;
      Quantitative models and direct in vivo measurements (Wagner et al, 2004, 2008) indicate that&#xD;
      the electrical currents induced by TMS are predominantly confined to a brain region directly&#xD;
      under the treatment coil. The procedure for positioning the coil over the cortical target is&#xD;
      described in the NeuroStar TMS System User Manual (volume 2, sections 6 and 7) and involves&#xD;
      first determining a location where stimulation leads to a contraction of the abductor policis&#xD;
      brevis muscle (visualized with a thumb twitch on the right hand) and then positioning the&#xD;
      coil 5.5 cm anterior to that position along the left Superior Oblique Angle line. While this&#xD;
      target can be located with good reproducibility and was associated with therapeutic outcome&#xD;
      in the NCT trial, it is not clear that this positions the coil over the best target within&#xD;
      the DLPFC for all patients. Indeed, individual differences in gyral anatomy and in gross&#xD;
      brain size both add variability to the specific neuroanatomic region being stimulated, and&#xD;
      this may impact treatment efficiency.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exposure to even a brief train of TMS pulses can elicit an acute physiologic change (cf&#xD;
      Siebner and Rothwell, 2003), and so a test procedure can be performed that will assess the&#xD;
      distance from the standard treatment position to the point eliciting a maximal acute&#xD;
      physiologic response. We propose a 9-locus mapping procedure, involving the assessment of&#xD;
      changes in brain activity from stimulation at locations including and around the standard&#xD;
      treatment target. The nine locations will be the usual treatment location and 8 other points,&#xD;
      1.5 and 3.0 cm anterior, posterior, rostral, and caudal of the primary target. Test&#xD;
      stimulation will be for 15 seconds (=150 pulses @ 10 Hz) at each location, followed by 5&#xD;
      minutes of continuous EEG recording to examine acute changes in regional brain activity in&#xD;
      response to a brief stimulation exposure. All therapeutic stimulations will take place in the&#xD;
      standard location, and we will be able to evaluate what proportion of variance in clinical&#xD;
      outcome is explained by distance from the location of maximal acute physiologic response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on these previous studies, we propose to assess patients during treatment with TMS,&#xD;
      using clinical symptom ratings and brain physiology with EEG.&#xD;
