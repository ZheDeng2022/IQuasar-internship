      Asthma is a chronic disorder of the airways primarily driven by increased airway&#xD;
      inflammation, and is an escalating medical problem in Canada. For example, between 1994 and&#xD;
      2001 there was a 40% increase in the number of Canadians who had asthma. Not only is the&#xD;
      prevalence of asthma increasing but there has been a rapid rise in the number of asthma&#xD;
      events and costs associated with asthma and poor asthma control. It has been estimated that&#xD;
      the global cost of caring for asthma exceeds that of AIDS/HIV and tuberculosis combined.&#xD;
      These increases have occurred in spite of the development of clear asthma management&#xD;
      guidelines. There is evidence to suggest that aerobic exercise, e.g., running or cycling, may&#xD;
      improve asthma symptoms and control in children. However, there are currently no studies that&#xD;
      have systematically assessed the effects of exercise on asthma control or symptoms in adults.&#xD;
      The current proposed study will assess the effects of aerobic exercise in sedentary patients&#xD;
      with poorly controlled asthma. In addition to usual medical care, 52 patients will&#xD;
      participate in a supervised aerobic exercise program. The program will consist of 3 X 1hr&#xD;
      sessions of supervised exercise per week for 12 weeks. Another 52 patients will only maintain&#xD;
      usual medical care. The asthma control, quality of life, and inflammatory profile will be&#xD;
      evaluated at baseline and following the 12 weeks of treatment. The investigators believe&#xD;
      that: (1) The exercise intervention will significant improve asthma control and asthma&#xD;
      quality of life; (2) The exercise intervention will result in significant improvements in&#xD;
      inflammatory profiles; and (3) These changes in the inflammatory profile will be directly&#xD;
      related to the improvements in asthma control and quality of life.&#xD;

      Introduction: Asthma is a chronic respiratory disorder primarily driven by increased airway&#xD;
      inflammation. It is one of the most prevalent chronic conditions affecting Canadians. It is&#xD;
      the most common chronic illness affecting children and the fourth most common disorders&#xD;
      affecting adults. In 2001, nearly 2.2 million (8.4%) Canadians were diagnosed as having&#xD;
      asthma. More importantly, asthma is an escalating medical problem in Canada, e.g., between&#xD;
      1994 and 2001, there was a 40% increase in the number of Canadians with asthma. Not only is&#xD;
      the prevalence of asthma increasing, but there has been a rapid rise in the morbidity and&#xD;
      costs associated with asthma and its poor control. The WHO estimated that the global cost of&#xD;
      caring for asthma exceeds that of AIDS/HIV and tuberculosis combined. Though recent&#xD;
      guidelines have emphasized the importance of improving asthma control and quality of life,&#xD;
      leading to huge amounts of resource being dedicated to this, more than 50% of adult patients&#xD;
      with asthma remain poorly controlled. As current treatment strategies appear to be failing,&#xD;
      it is important to target simple, cost effective interventions that are applicable for most&#xD;
      patients with asthma and will increase overall levels of control and decrease asthma&#xD;
      morbidity. There is evidence to suggest that aerobic exercise may improve asthma symptoms and&#xD;
      control in children. In addition, there is evidence that exercise directly improves&#xD;
      inflammatory and immune profiles in non-asthma patients, which may provide the mechanism by&#xD;
      which exercise could improve asthma. However, there are no known studies that have&#xD;
      systematically assessed the effects of aerobic exercise on asthma control, quality of life or&#xD;
      immune function in adult asthma populations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: The primary objective of the current application is to assess the efficacy of&#xD;
      aerobic exercise as an intervention to improve asthma control and quality of life in adult&#xD;
      patients with asthma. The results of this study will provide data that will inform physicians&#xD;
      and members of the Thoracic community about the benefits of exercise for asthma. The study&#xD;
      will also assess potential inflammatory pathways by which exercise may elicit improvements in&#xD;
      asthma morbidity. The results of this study should be available for the next Canadian&#xD;
      Thoracic Society Canadian Adult Consensus Guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology: The current proposal is for a study of aerobic exercise in sedentary patients&#xD;
      with poorly controlled asthma. In addition to usual care, 52 patients will undertake&#xD;
      supervised aerobic exercise. The exercise program will consist of 3 X 1hr sessions of&#xD;
      supervised exercise per week for 12 weeks. The exercise routine, under medical supervision,&#xD;
      will consist of 10 minutes of warm up exercises, 40 minutes of biking and/or walking (and&#xD;
      eventually jogging), and 10 minutes of cool down exercises. These patients will be compared&#xD;
      to a group of 52 patients who will follow their usual regimen, this group will be offered the&#xD;
      exercise programme once they have completed the post assessments. For the primary outcomes&#xD;
      (asthma control [Asthma Control Questionnaire], quality of life [Asthma Quality of Life&#xD;
      Questionnaire]) and secondary outcomes (inflammatory profile) will be evaluated at baseline&#xD;
      and after 12 weeks (the length of the treatment). To check the efficacy of the intervention&#xD;
      both lung function, ambulatory peak flow, and exercise tolerance data will also be collected.&#xD;
      Repeated measures analysis of covariance-type models with time (pre, post intervention) as&#xD;
      the within subject factor, group (exercise, usual care) as the between factor, and sex, age,&#xD;
      and asthma severity as the covariates will be used for the primary outcome variables. To&#xD;
      assess the potential mechanistic role of inflammation on the exercise-asthma relationship a&#xD;
      series of regression-like GLMs will be conducted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is hypothesized that: (1) The exercise intervention will result in clinically and&#xD;
      statistically significant improvements in levels of asthma control and asthma quality of&#xD;
      life; (2) The exercise intervention will result in clinically and statistically significant&#xD;
      improvements in inflammatory profiles, with reductions in Th2 cytokines, and activation of&#xD;
      inflammatory cells, and increases in Th1 cytokines; and (3) Changes in inflammatory profile&#xD;
      will be directly linked to improvements in asthma measures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We believe that the proposal will have great clinical significance for patient management.&#xD;
      This project will be the first to systematically evaluate the benefits of exercise training&#xD;
      on asthma control and quality of life in adult asthma patients. We anticipate that the&#xD;
      results of this study will form the basis for new national and international guidelines and&#xD;
      will provide an evidence-based background for physicians to prescribe aerobic exercise for&#xD;
      patients with asthma.&#xD;
