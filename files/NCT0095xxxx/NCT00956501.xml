      The purpose of this pilot study is to characterize changes in postural orientation and&#xD;
      equilibrium in early diagnosed ALS patient. The investigators plan to cross validate the use&#xD;
      of a standardized test of equilibrium (EquiTest, Computerized Dynamic Posturography - CDP) in&#xD;
      early diagnosed ALS patients.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      ALS is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder involving primarily upper and lower motor&#xD;
      neurons. The progressive loss in motor neurons leads to weakness, fatigue, spasticity, and&#xD;
      loss of balance. Falls are reported in 30-35% of ALS patients prior to enrolment to ALS&#xD;
      clinic. This early loss of balance may not be detected by the classical neurological exam, or&#xD;
      the standard clinical balance scales. Understanding the impairments in the balance control&#xD;
      system which leads to fall during the course of ALS is a prerequisite for the clinical&#xD;
      decision-making process in order to develop a proper balance rehabilitation program and fall&#xD;
      prevention strategies for these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients and control subjects will undergo balance system evaluation consisting of the&#xD;
      following testing:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Sensory Organization Test Protocol&#xD;
&#xD;
           Standardized EquiTest assessment protocol:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Sensory Organization Test (SOT) - will be used to measure change how well participants&#xD;
           maintain balance under progressively more difficult test conditions, which either&#xD;
           disrupt or remove visual and proprioceptive feedback. Visual and proprioceptive&#xD;
           environments will be altered systematically for fixed support and sway-referenced&#xD;
           support and surround conditions, and under normal (eyes open), absent (eyes closed), and&#xD;
           sway-referenced vision (eyes sway-referenced). Under sway-referenced conditions, the&#xD;
           platform on which the subject stands and/or the visual surround also move proportionally&#xD;
           to their AP sway. During SRC the floor and visual surround are controlled by a&#xD;
           servomechanism (Gain=1.0) to follow movements of the subjects' center of gravity.&#xD;
           Sway-referencing eliminates accurate somatosensory and/or visual information used to&#xD;
           orient the body. Performance under sway-referenced visual conditions shows the&#xD;
           participant's ability to suppress conflicting visual inputs and to rely on alternative&#xD;
           systems for maintaining equilibrium (table 1).&#xD;
&#xD;
           Participants are carefully positioned on the platform by aligning the lateral malleoli&#xD;
           with the axis of rotation of the platform and visual surround. Participants wear a&#xD;
           harness during all testing, which protects participants from falling. As an additional&#xD;
           safety measure, the technician stands behind the participant. There are three trials per&#xD;
           condition with each trial lasting 20 seconds. When a participant takes a step, touches&#xD;
           the surround panels, or needs assistance from the technician, that trial is marked as a&#xD;
           fall and the participant receives an equilibrium score of zero for that trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
           In addition to the ES, movement strategy scores (MSS) will be measured by horizontal&#xD;
           shear forces. Movement strategy scores reflect the relative use of movement about the&#xD;
           ankle, hips and upper body to maintain balance during the SOT. Scores around 100 reflect&#xD;
           a predominant use of ankle strategy to maintain balance, whereas low scores are&#xD;
           indicative of the use of hip strategies to restore stability.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Motor Control Test Protocol The Motor Control Test (MCT), using the same apparatus will&#xD;
           be performed to examine postural responses to external perturbations. During the MCT,&#xD;
           subjects will receive perturbation from the force platform. Perturbations are expressed&#xD;
           as translation movement (medium horizontal anterior to posterior movements of less than&#xD;
           1 sec. duration) or as rotation movements (at 6.0 degrees per second, which cause ankle&#xD;
           dorsiflexion or plantarflexion). Six forward and six backward translations are&#xD;
           generated. Five toes up and five toes down rotations are generated. The computer assures&#xD;
           random delays of 1.5 to 2.5 seconds between translation trials and 3.0 to 5.0 seconds&#xD;
           between rotation trials. During each perturbation, the computer monitors the subjects&#xD;
           sway responses, measuring forces exerted against the dual force plate. These forces are&#xD;
           expressed as weight symmetry and strength symmetry. Weight symmetry measures the&#xD;
           distribution of total body weight over each leg, independent of other response strength&#xD;
           and strength symmetry measures. Weight symmetry scores near 100 indicate a symmetrical&#xD;
           weight distribution (EquiTest manual, 1991).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome variables:&#xD;
&#xD;
      i. Sensory Organization Test (SOT) scores on conditions 1-6. ii. Movement Strategy Score on&#xD;
      conditions 1-6 iii. Weight Symmetry Score on conditions 1-6&#xD;
