      The aim of this study is to answer the following question: In healthy infants aged four to&#xD;
      six months undergoing routine immunization for diphtheria, tetanus, acellular pertussis,&#xD;
      inactivated poliovirus and Haemophilus influenzae type B (DTaP-IPV-Hib) and pneumococcal&#xD;
      conjugate vaccine (PCV) while receiving a combination of proven analgesic interventions&#xD;
      (least painful injection technique, holding by parent, and oral sucrose solution) and&#xD;
      non-procedural talk by the parent, does the addition of rubbing near the site of injection&#xD;
      reduce pain as measured by the Modified Behavioral Pain Scale (MBPS) to a greater extent than&#xD;
      no rubbing?&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Immunization is a significant source of pain and distress for infants. At present&#xD;
      pain-relieving interventions are rarely employed to manage this pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are many non-pharmacological methods that can be used to reduce immunization pain.&#xD;
      These include: sugar water, fast injection without aspiration, holding infants during the&#xD;
      procedure, and non-procedural related parental behaviours such as distraction. At present,&#xD;
      there are no studies of tactile stimulation during noxious procedures in infants and its&#xD;
      effectiveness, therefore, is unclear. Light rubbing of the skin near the injection site that&#xD;
      is administered by a parent immediately before, during and immediately after immunization is&#xD;
      an easily learned, cost neutral intervention that could offer improved pain management.&#xD;
