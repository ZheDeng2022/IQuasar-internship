      The purpose of this study is to determine in women the risk/benefit profile and&#xD;
      non-inferiority of a topical 5% Minoxidil foam formulation applied once daily for the&#xD;
      treatment of androgenetic alopecia in comparison to 2% MTS used twice daily, using objective&#xD;
      and subjective efficacy measures and safety assessments for a study period of 24 weeks.&#xD;
