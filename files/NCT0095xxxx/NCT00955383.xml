  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      GSK2190915 is currently in development for the treatment of asthma. This study aims to assess&#xD;
      the safety and tolerability of single doses of GSK2190915 in healthy Japanese subjects. The&#xD;
      study will also look at the pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD) of single doses&#xD;
      of GSK2190915 and aims to characterise the PK/PD relationship in healthy Japanese subjects.&#xD;
      Twelve healthy Japanese subjects will take part in this single escalating dose study and&#xD;
      subjects will receive one of five possible treatments, 10 mg, 50 mg, 150 mg, 450 mg&#xD;
      GSK2190915 or placebo in each treatment period. Blood samples (for safety, pharmacokinetics&#xD;
      and pharmacodynamics), urine samples (for safety and pharmacodynamics) and ECGs, blood&#xD;
      pressure readings, physical examinations and a review of adverse events will take place at a&#xD;
      number of timepoints pre and post each dose. A minimum 7 day washout between treatment&#xD;
      periods will be required. Regardless if a subject completes or prematurely withdraws from the&#xD;
      study, a follow up visit will be completed 7-10 days following last dose.&#xD;

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  AST, ALT, alkaline phosphatase and bilirubin less than or equal to 1.5xULN (isolated&#xD;
             bilirubin &gt;1.5xULN is acceptable if bilirubin is fractionated and direct bilirubin&#xD;
             &lt;35%).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Healthy as determined by a responsible and experienced physician, based on a medical&#xD;
             evaluation including medical history, physical examination, laboratory tests and 12&#xD;
             lead ECG. A subject with a clinical abnormality or laboratory parameters outside the&#xD;
             reference range for the population being studied may be included only if the&#xD;
             Investigator and the GSK Medical Monitor agree that the finding is unlikely to&#xD;
             introduce additional risk factors and will not interfere with the study procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Japanese ethnic origin (defined as having been born in Japan with four ethnic Japanese&#xD;
             grandparents and able to speak Japanese).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Male or female (of non-childbearing potential) between 20 and 65 years of age&#xD;
             inclusive, at the time of signing the informed consent. A female subject is eligible&#xD;
             to participate if she is of:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Non-childbearing potential defined as pre-menopausal females with a documented tubal&#xD;
        ligation or hysterectomy; or postmenopausal defined as 12 months of spontaneous amenorrhea&#xD;
        [in questionable cases a blood sample with simultaneous follicle stimulating hormone (FSH)&#xD;
        &gt; 40 MlU/ml and estradiol &lt; 40 pg/ml (&lt;140 pmol/L) is confirmatory]. Females on hormone&#xD;
        replacement therapy (HRT) and whose menopausal status is in doubt will be required to use&#xD;
        one of the contraception methods in Section 8.1 of the protocol if they wish to continue&#xD;
        their HRT during the study. Otherwise, they must discontinue HRT to allow confirmation of&#xD;
        post-menopausal status prior to study enrollment. For most forms of HRT, at least 2-4 weeks&#xD;
        will elapse between the cessation of therapy and the blood draw; this interval depends on&#xD;
        the type and dosage of HRT. Following confirmation of their post-menopausal status, they&#xD;
        can resume use of HRT during the study without use of a contraceptive method.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Male subjects must agree to use one of the contraception methods listed in Section 8.1&#xD;
             of the protocol. This criterion must be followed from the time of the first dose of&#xD;
             study medication until 3 months after administration of the last dose (this far&#xD;
             exceeds the 5 half lives after administration of the last dose).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Body weight more than or equal to 45 kg and BMI within the range 18 - 28 kg/m2&#xD;
             (inclusive)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Capable of giving written informed consent, which includes compliance with the&#xD;
             requirements and restrictions listed in the consent form.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  12 lead ECG without any clinically significant abnormality as judged by the&#xD;
             Investigator, and QTcB or QTcF &lt; 450 msec.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Non-smokers (never smoked or not smoking for &gt;6 months with &lt;10 pack years history&#xD;
             (Pack years = (cigarettes per day smoked/20) x number of years smoked))&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A positive pre-study Hepatitis B surface antigen or positive Hepatitis C antibody&#xD;
             result within 3 months of screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Current or chronic history of liver disease, or known hepatic or biliary abnormalities&#xD;
             (with the exception of Gilbert's syndrome or asymptomatic gallstones).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Significant cardiac, pulmonary, metabolic, renal, gastrointestinal abnormalities or&#xD;
             other conditions that in the opinion of the investigator and/or GSK medical monitor,&#xD;
             places the subject at an unacceptable risk as a participant in this trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A positive pre-study drug/alcohol screen. A minimum list of drugs that will be&#xD;
             screened for include amphetamines, barbiturates, cocaine, opiates, cannabinoids and&#xD;
             benzodiazepines. The detection of drugs with a legitimate medical use would not&#xD;
             necessarily be an exclusion to study participation. The detection of alcohol would not&#xD;
             be an exclusion at screening but would need to be negative pre-dose and during the&#xD;
             study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A positive test for HIV antibody.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of regular alcohol consumption within 6 months of the study defined as average&#xD;
             weekly intake of &gt;21 units for males or &gt;14 units for females. One unit is equivalent&#xD;
             to 8 g of alcohol: a half-pint (~240 ml) of beer, 1 glass (125 ml) of wine or 1 (25&#xD;
             ml) measure of spirits.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The subject has participated in a clinical trial and has received an investigational&#xD;
             product within the following time period prior to the first dosing day in the current&#xD;
             study: 30 days, 5 half-lives or twice the duration of the biological effect of the&#xD;
             investigational product (whichever is longer).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Exposure to more than four new chemical entities within 12 months prior to the first&#xD;
             dosing day.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Use of prescription or non-prescription drugs, including CYP3A4 inhibitors and&#xD;
             inducers, vitamins, herbal and dietary supplements (including St John's Wort) from 14&#xD;
             days before screening until the follow-up visit, unless in the opinion of the&#xD;
             Investigator and GSK Medical Monitor the medication will not interfere with the study&#xD;
             procedures or compromise subject safety. Hormone Replacement Therapy (HRT) is&#xD;
             permitted for post-menopausal females.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of sensitivity to any of the study medications, or components thereof or a&#xD;
             history of drug or other allergy that, in the opinion of the investigator or GSK&#xD;
             Medical Monitor, contraindicates their participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Where participation in the study would result in donation of blood or blood products&#xD;
             in excess of 500mL within a 56 day period.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant females as determined by positive serum hCG test at screening or prior to&#xD;
             dosing.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Lactating females.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Unwillingness or inability to follow the procedures outlined in the protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject is mentally or legally incapacitated.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Urinary cotinine levels indicative of smoking or history or regular use of tobacco- or&#xD;
             nicotine-containing products within 6 months prior to screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Consumption of red wine, seville oranges, grapefruit or grapefruit juice and/or&#xD;
             pummelos, exotic citrus fruits, grapefruit hybrids or fruit juices from 7 days prior&#xD;
             to the first dose of study medication.&#xD;
