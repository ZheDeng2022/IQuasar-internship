  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The current study involves a novel and aggressive therapeutic approach for patients' prostate&#xD;
      cancer. In addition, the investigators propose to administer hormonal therapy to patients&#xD;
      with an especially high risk: those with initial Gleason scores of &gt; 6, PSA &gt; 10 ng/ml, T3/T4&#xD;
      primary tumors, and those found to be node positive (N+). The use of hormonal therapy in&#xD;
      these specific settings correlates with our current standard of care. IMRT is better able to&#xD;
      spare and protect normal tissues from receiving radiation than 3-D conformal RT. The&#xD;
      radiotherapy would be followed by continued hormonal therapy for a total of 6 months in those&#xD;
      who have one of the following Gleason 7 and PSA 10-20 and as per the previous version of this&#xD;
      trial, 1 year similar to that delivered by the EORTC for higher risk patients, (those with&#xD;
      initial Gleason scores of &gt; 8, PSA &gt; 20 ng/ml, or T3/T4 tumors). Those found to be N(+) would&#xD;
      have the hormonal therapy continued indefinitely or until disease progression occurred in a&#xD;
      manner analogous to the Messing et. al. series in prostatectomy patients. The goals are to&#xD;
      develop and administer a program of treatment that includes the most recent developments in&#xD;
      imaging, integrating data from both the CT scan and the ProstaScint scan to optimize prostate&#xD;
      cancer RT. The CT scan will be used for staging and to determine the exact location of the&#xD;
      entire prostate which will receive a reasonable dose of RT. The ProstaScint will be used to&#xD;
      assess the spread of disease to lymph nodes as well as to determine the exact location of the&#xD;
      tumor within the prostate gland. This region will then be boosted to a tumorcidal dose. The&#xD;
      investigators then plan to monitor the toxicity and outcome of this treatment. The&#xD;
      investigators expect that this program of radioimmunoguided IMRT will likely result in&#xD;
      similar or less toxicity and increased cure rates when compared to conventional radiotherapy&#xD;
      and standard IMRT programs.&#xD;
