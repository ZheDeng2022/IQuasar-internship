      The purpose of this study is to determine the safety and effectiveness of Umbilical Cord&#xD;
      Blood Transplant (UCBT) to treat the patient's disease, and to see if this treatment can&#xD;
      decrease the incidence of GVHD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is for patients that were born with a disease that affects their body's metabolism&#xD;
      or immune system. The doctor plans to treat the patient for this illness with a stem cell&#xD;
      transplant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While improved medical care has allowed many people with these diseases to live longer, the&#xD;
      only way to truly cure the diseases is by means of a stem cell transplant from a donor who&#xD;
      does not have the disease. A stem cell transplant will replace sick cells with new healthy&#xD;
      donor cells. Stem cells grow into different types of blood cells that people need, including&#xD;
      red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets. In a stem cell transplant, the patients&#xD;
      own stem cells would be killed by chemotherapy drug and then replaced by stem cells from the&#xD;
      donor. Stem cells can be collected from the bone marrow, peripheral blood or umbilical cords.&#xD;
      In this study, umbilical cords will be the source of the stem cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently, large inventories of umbilical cord blood units are available in public banks for&#xD;
      transplantation in those lacking bone marrow donors. UCB transplants offer several advantages&#xD;
      over adult bone marrow or peripheral blood stem cell transplants, including:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Rapid availability,&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Absence of donor risk,&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Low risk of transmissible infectious diseases,&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Low risk of acute GvHD (as compared to recipients of unrelated donor marrow and&#xD;
           peripheral blood cells).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The two main causes of death after umbilical cord blood transplantation for disorders for&#xD;
      these kinds of patients, are graft failure and infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study we are trying to address these two problems by using different drugs to prepare&#xD;
      patients for the transplant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To help improve engraftment (cells begin to grow), we will include the drug Fludarabine to&#xD;
      the usually used Busulfan and Cytoxan that the study patients will receive before their&#xD;
      transplant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will try to decrease the chance of developing graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) by using&#xD;
      Cyclosporin A (CSA) and Mycophenolate Mofetil (MMF), instead of Anti-Thymocyte Globulin (ATG)&#xD;
      which is normally used.&#xD;

      Patients will be examined to make sure that they meet the requirements of this study. There&#xD;
      will be tests of the heart and of the lungs. X-rays will be taken of the lungs and other&#xD;
      organs, depending on the disease. An MRI and consultations with different specialists will&#xD;
      also be conducted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients also must have a negative pregnancy test before entering this study if they are a&#xD;
      woman of childbearing potential. The blood will be tested for viruses and to look at the&#xD;
      functioning of the liver and kidneys. The examination also includes HIV testing. If the&#xD;
      patient has HIV, they will not be able to be treated on this protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After we have determined that the patient is eligible for treatment on this study and a&#xD;
      suitable UCB stem donor has been found, they will have a central line placed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After placement of the central line, the following chemotherapy will be given to after&#xD;
      admission to the hospital:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  9 days before the infusion through 6 days before the infusion: Busulfan every 6 hours&#xD;
           for 16 total doses.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  5 days before the infusion through 2 days before the infusion: Cytoxan given daily for 4&#xD;
           days over 2 hours. (It can be given over 1 to 4 hours if needed as decided by the&#xD;
           physician). Mesna will be given per standards.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  4 days before the infusion through 1 day before the infusion: Fludarabine given daily&#xD;
           for 4 days over 1 hour.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stem cell transplant (infusion of the UCB stem cells) - defined as Day 0 of the treatment.&#xD;
      All other &quot;numbered&quot; days relate to this infusion date. For example, Day 1 is the first day&#xD;
      after the stem cell transplant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Standard Therapy: Phenytoin will be given according to the standards of the TCH formulary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cyclosporin A (CSA) will be given starting 2 days prior to the stem cell infusion. It will be&#xD;
      given daily over 2 hours every 12 hours, and then tapered if no GvHD is present.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Administration of Mycophenolate Mofetil (MMF) will start on the day the stem cell infusion is&#xD;
      completed, and will continue daily for 45 days unless the patient develops GvHD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intravenous Immunoglobulins (IVIG) will be given as per CAGT SOP for infections prophylaxis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor (GCSF) will be given daily starting at Day +7 until ANC&#xD;
      is greater than 2,500 for three consecutive days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Evaluation: Patients will have various study evaluations, including blood samples,&#xD;
      before and after the transplant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-Up: After year 1, the patients will be asked to return to the clinic once a year for&#xD;
      consultations. These consultations with specialists will be similar to the ones the patients&#xD;
      had before their transplant.&#xD;
