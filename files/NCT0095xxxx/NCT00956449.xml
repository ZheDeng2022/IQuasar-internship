  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the antibody response to each of the three influenza&#xD;
      vaccine strains included in the licensed seasonal flu vaccine, as measured by&#xD;
      hemagglutination inhibition (HI) at 21 days post immunization in non-elderly and elderly&#xD;
      subjects in compliance with the requirements of the current European Union (EU)&#xD;
      recommendations for the evaluation of the immunogenicity for a new formulation of a licensed&#xD;
      flu vaccine (CPMP/BWP/214/96).&#xD;
