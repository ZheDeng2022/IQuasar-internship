    <textblock>
      Functional dyspepsia is one of the most common digestive disorders. The pathophysiology of&#xD;
      functional dyspepsia is uncertain. Proton pump inhibitor (PPI) has been recommended as the&#xD;
      first line treatment for functional dyspepsia. However, the mechanism of symptom relief is&#xD;
      unclear. Most of the previous studies were performed on healthy volunteers who received only&#xD;
      a very short course of PPI. The correlation between symptom and gastric emptying is lacking&#xD;
      in these studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Demographic data and anthropometric measurements will be obtained for baseline assessment.&#xD;
      Patients are required to complete FGI Screening Questionnaire, Functional dyspepsia symptom&#xD;
      questionnaire, gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) symptom questionnaire and irritable&#xD;
      bowel syndrome (IBS) symptom questionnaire to have a thorough assessment of their GI&#xD;
      symptoms. (1) Satiety test and ghrelin profile, and (2)gastric emptying test will be arranged&#xD;
      as two individual visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After baseline investigations, patients will be randomly assigned to either Nexium 20 mg&#xD;
      daily or identical looking placebo for 8 weeks. The patients will report their individual&#xD;
      dyspeptic symptoms on weekly basis using a self-administered symptom questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Satiety test and ghrelin profile, gastric emptying study will be repeated at the end of&#xD;
      8-week treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: Long-term PPI relieves dyspeptic symptom through acceleration of gastric emptying&#xD;
      rate.&#xD;

      Background&#xD;
&#xD;
      Functional dyspepsia is one of the commonest digestive disorders. It is a functional&#xD;
      gastrointestinal disorder which is characterized by chronic recurrent epigastric symptoms&#xD;
      such as pain, burning and a variety of postprandial symptoms with absence of demonstrable&#xD;
      organic pathology identified on investigations. It has been reported that functional&#xD;
      dyspepsia affects 10-30% of adult population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The pathophysiology of functional dyspepsia is uncertain. It is thought to be a heterogeneous&#xD;
      disorder. Various factors have been implicated in the pathophysiology of functional&#xD;
      dyspepsia. It has been reported that delayed gastric emptying, impaired proximal gastric&#xD;
      accommodation, visceral hypersensitivity and Helicobacter pylori gastritis play a role in&#xD;
      development of functional dyspepsia. However, the correlation between these physiological&#xD;
      abnormalities and symptomatology of functional dyspepsia is poor. It is still controversial&#xD;
      whether these pathophysiological factors are responsible for specific symptoms in functional&#xD;
      dyspepsia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While mechanism of functional dyspepsia is unclear, treatment has also been far from&#xD;
      satisfactory. Proton pump inhibitor has been recommended as the first line treatment for&#xD;
      functional dyspepsia and it has been shown that the use of PPI is associated with a 14%&#xD;
      reduction in risk of persistent dyspepsia compared to placebo. However, the mechanism of&#xD;
      symptom relief is unclear. While PPI exerts its effect primarily through suppression of&#xD;
      acid-induced symptoms, recent studies have shown that PPI may affect gastric motility&#xD;
      function such as gastric volume, gastric emptying and trigger of migratory motor complex.&#xD;
      Most of these studies were performed on healthy volunteers who received only a very short&#xD;
      course of PPI. The correlation between symptom and gastric emptying is lacking in these&#xD;
      studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aims&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the effect of esomeprazole on gastric emptying&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the relationship between dyspeptic symptom and gastric emptying&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis&#xD;
&#xD;
      Long-term PPI relieves dyspeptic symptom through acceleration of gastric emptying rate&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design&#xD;
&#xD;
      Double-blind randomized placebo-controlled trial&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline assessment&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Demographic: age, gender&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Anthropometric measurements: body mass index, height, weight and waist circumference&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  FGI Screening Questionnaire (v.2, 20090106) for screening of functional gastrointestinal&#xD;
           disorder according to Rome III criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Functional dyspepsia symptom questionnaire (FDSQ) (20080416): an 8-item dyspeptic&#xD;
           symptom score questionnaire: 4-point Likert scale for assessment of epigastric pain,&#xD;
           epigastric burning, belching, bloating, postprandial fullness, early satiation, nausea&#xD;
           and vomiting and a global dyspeptic symptom assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  GERD Symptom questionnaire (GERDSQ) (20080416): GERD symptom score questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Irritable Bowel Syndrome Symptom questionnaire (IBSSQ) (20080428): IBS symptom score&#xD;
           questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Satiety test and ghrelin profile&#xD;
&#xD;
      After an overnight fast, the patients are instructed to ingest Ensure® (1.06 kcal/ml; 22%&#xD;
      fat, 64% carbohydrate, and 14% protein) at constant rate of 30ml/min, and complete a Fullness&#xD;
      Rating Scale (FRS) at 3-min intervals (ie. 0min, 3min, 6min…). The test will stop when a&#xD;
      score of 4, which is equivalent to unbearable fullness, is reached in FRS. The volume&#xD;
      (calorie) of Ensure that is ingested will be recorded and it serves as surrogate marker of&#xD;
      satiety function. Serial blood sample (2ml each) will also be taken at 0, 30, 60, 90, 120min&#xD;
      during test for assay of ghrelin and gastrin profile. If the test is stopped before 120&#xD;
      minutes, the remaining blood will still be taken according to schedule.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Gastric emptying test with FANci2&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measurement of gastric emptying rate of solid meal will be accomplished using 13C-octanoic&#xD;
      acid breath test within 7 days after satiety test. After 12-hour fasting, the patient is&#xD;
      required to ingest a pan-fried egg with 2 pieces of bread that contains 100 ul of&#xD;
      13C-octanoic acid dissolved in egg yolk. The exhaled gas will be collected at 15-minute&#xD;
      intervals until 4 hours have passed. The 13CO2 content of the exhaled gas will be measured by&#xD;
      a breath test device (FANci2, FAN GmbH.,Germany). 13CO2 is released after the 13C-octanoic&#xD;
      acid enriched meal is emptied into the stomach and digested in duodenum.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization of treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
      After baseline investigations, patients will be randomly assigned to either Esomeprazole 20&#xD;
      mg daily or identical looking placebo for 8 weeks. The random allocation sequence will be&#xD;
      obtained from a computer-generated list of random numbers in blocks of 10. Concealed&#xD;
      allocation is achieved by an independent staff who assigns treatments according to&#xD;
      consecutive numbers in sealed envelopes. Study medications are dispensed as sealed packages&#xD;
      in consecutive numbers. Medication adherence is measured by pill counts during interval&#xD;
      visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up assessment&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients will report their individual dyspeptic symptoms on weekly basis using a&#xD;
      self-administered symptom questionnaire. At week 4 and week 8, they will need to give an&#xD;
      additional rating on their overall symptom response using global symptom assessment. The&#xD;
      patients are required to give a dichotomous response of either &quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no&quot; to the question&#xD;
      stating &quot;Do you have adequate relief of symptoms over the past 7 days?&quot;. Satiety test and&#xD;
      blood sampling, gastric emptying study will be repeated at the end of 8-week treatment.&#xD;
