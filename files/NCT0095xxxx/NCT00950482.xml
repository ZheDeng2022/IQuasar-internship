  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This pilot project is a randomized research study to examine the effects of acupuncture on&#xD;
      menopausal symptoms. The investigators will recruit up to 45 Cedars employees (excluding Dr&#xD;
      Bairey Merz's employees) with menopausal symptoms by posting a study flyer on Exchange. If a&#xD;
      patient is interested in this study, she may contact the research team for further&#xD;
      information. Once a patient is identified as being eligible for the study, she will be&#xD;
      contacted to schedule the screening visit. They will receive an explanation of the study.&#xD;
      They will be sent the consent form to review prior to the initial visit. At the initial&#xD;
      visit, prior to any study-related procedures, the consent will be reviewed with the patient.&#xD;
      After all questions have been answered and the patient appears to fully understand the study,&#xD;
      the patient will be asked to provide written consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This pilot project will collect data from three study groups as stated in the NIH application&#xD;
      proposal. The first research study group will undergo traditional acupuncture (TA). The&#xD;
      second research study group will receive alternative acupuncture (AA). The third group will&#xD;
      be a waiting control group (WC) that will receive four weeks of acupuncture following&#xD;
      completion of the study duration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Traditional acupuncture means that the needle is inserted in true acupuncture point&#xD;
      locations. Alternative acupuncture is a technique that varies slightly from traditional&#xD;
      acupuncture and is used to assess which technique, if any, produces the best therapeutic&#xD;
      results. Waiting control is a group of subjects who get neither traditional nor alternative&#xD;
      acupuncture during the duration of treatment, which in this case, is 3 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be randomized into one of the three study groups, and will have one in three&#xD;
      chance of being placed in one of the three groups. Neither patients nor the investigators can&#xD;
      choose which group patients are assigned to. Patients from TA and AA groups will be asked to&#xD;
      come to Cedars-Sinai a total of 39 times (36 sessions and 3 clinic visits) over a three-four&#xD;
      month period. It will compare the effects (good or bad) of traditional acupuncture (TA) with&#xD;
      alternative acupuncture (AA) on the menopausal symptoms to be studied in this research.&#xD;
      Patients from WC group will be asked to come to Cedars-Siani a total of 15 times. Other study&#xD;
      procedures include physical exam, blood and urine collection for hormone tests, questionnaire&#xD;
      interview, etc.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the pilot phase of this study subjects will record the number of mild, moderate,&#xD;
      severe and/or very severe hot flashes that occur each day in a hot flash diary. There is also&#xD;
      an option for patients to record other symptoms they may experience during that week other&#xD;
      then hot flashes as well as a place for additional comments. Subjects will complete the diary&#xD;
      for seven consecutive days. It is a simple form that takes very little time to complete each&#xD;
      day (only 5-10 minutes) and will not impact the duration of the study participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      No genetic study will be conducted in this pilot project.&#xD;
