      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The uterine cervix is composed of muscle and collagen, which change as women age and&#xD;
           under hormonal influences like puberty, pregnancy, and menopause. Yet even though&#xD;
           knowledge of structure of the cervix (especially the collagen network) is important to&#xD;
           detect problems that may affect pregnancy and other women s health issues, no&#xD;
           noninvasive techniques are available to evaluate such changes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A specially designed polarized camera attached to a conventional colposcope can be used&#xD;
           to take cervical images. Analyzing these images may enable researchers to better&#xD;
           visualize the collagen network in the cervix.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To explore and gain experience with the use of a polarized imaging system to study&#xD;
           cervical structure.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the usefulness of a polarized imaging system in studying the cervical&#xD;
           structure of healthy nonpregnant women.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Adult females (at least 18 years of age) who are having regular menstrual cycles and are&#xD;
      not on hormonal medications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Images will be takes from the cervix in two different phases of menstruation cycle time,&#xD;
           one in the follicular phase (before ovulation) and another one in the luteal phase&#xD;
           (after ovulation).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The images of the cervix will be taken with a vaginal speculum in place with the camera&#xD;
           attached to a colposcope. The colposcope will illuminate the cervix using polarized&#xD;
           light. Three random cervical locations will be photographed&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The uterine cervix is composed of muscle and collagen which changes as women age and under&#xD;
      hormonal influences like after puberty, during pregnancy, and with menopause. It has been&#xD;
      determined that during pregnancy, prior to cervical ripening, cross linked collagen fibrils&#xD;
      are organized in tight bundles which provide tensile strength, rigidity and stiffness. As the&#xD;
      cervix ripens in preparation for labor, cervical collagen concentration is decreases and&#xD;
      solubility increases. However, there are no noninvasive techniques available to evaluate such&#xD;
      structural changes especially of the collagen of cervix. Developing a non-invasive way to&#xD;
      evaluate the characteristics of cervical structure and collagen may aid in identifying women&#xD;
      who are at risk of early cervical dilation. A specially designed polarized camera attached to&#xD;
      a conventional colposcope can be used to take cervical images. Analyzing these images may&#xD;
      enable us to visualize the collagen network in cervix. The purpose of this study is to&#xD;
      explore the usefulness of polarized camera images in evaluating the cervical structure of&#xD;
      healthy women at different ages. After evaluating and validating this approach in healthy,&#xD;
      nonpregnant women, we plan to assess the cervical structure of pregnant women, some of whom&#xD;
      may be at risk of early cervical dilation.&#xD;
