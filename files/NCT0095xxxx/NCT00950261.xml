    <textblock>
      The standard postoperative treatment for patients with cervical cancer who had high-risk&#xD;
      factors is chemoradiation. Generally, weekly cisplatin or 5FU+cisplatin every 3 week have&#xD;
      been used as chemotherapy regimens of chemoradiation. Based on their experience, the&#xD;
      investigators hypothesized that tri-weekly cisplatin could be superior to weekly cisplatin.&#xD;
      Therefore, the investigators are going to perform the efficacy study of postoperative,&#xD;
      tri-weekly cisplatin chemoradiation for patients with cervical cancer.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cervical carcinoma is one of the most common gynecologic cancers worldwide. The prognosis of&#xD;
      cervical cancer is favorable, with around 80-90% 5-year survival rate in early stage disease.&#xD;
      However, advanced disease carries a poor prognosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The standard postoperative treatment for patients with cervical cancer who had high-risk&#xD;
      factors is chemoradiation. Based on the results of five randomized clinical trials, which&#xD;
      consistently showed improved survival in patients treated with cisplatin-based CRT, the&#xD;
      National Cancer Institute (NCI) of the United States announced that 'Strong consideration&#xD;
      should be given to the incorporation of concurrent cisplatin-based chemotherapy with RT in&#xD;
      women who require radiation therapy for treatment of cervical cancer' in 1999.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although recently reported meta-analysis studies also demonstrated improved local control&#xD;
      rates and survival with cisplatin-based chemotherapy concurrent to radiation therapy (RT),&#xD;
      the optimal cisplatin dose and dosing schedule are still undetermined. Among the previous&#xD;
      five randomized clinical trials, two trials performed by the Gynecologic Oncology Group (GOG)&#xD;
      used weekly cisplatin 40 mg/m2 while the other three trials used tri-weekly cisplatin at a&#xD;
      dosage range of 50 mg/m2 to 75 mg/m2 combined with 5-fluorouracil (5-FU).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite the diversity in cisplatin dose and dosing schedules, weekly cisplatin at a dose of&#xD;
      40 mg/m2 concurrent to RT is widely accepted as the standard regimen of CRT because of its&#xD;
      convenience, equal effectiveness, and favorable toxicity in comparison to other 5-FU combined&#xD;
      regimens.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, as a result of the GOG 165 study, which was closed prematurely because an interim&#xD;
      analysis found that patients in the 5-FU treatment group were not likely to achieve a better&#xD;
      outcome, the role of 5-FU (previously popularly included in clinical trials) as a&#xD;
      radiosensitizer became subject to debate. Furthermore, a clinical trial performed by the NCI&#xD;
      in Canada comparing pelvic RT alone with weekly cisplatin 40 mg/m2 concurrent to RT failed to&#xD;
      show improvement of progression free and 5-year survival. While the authors suggested several&#xD;
      possible reasons for why their study failed to demonstrate a survival benefit with concurrent&#xD;
      weekly cisplatin 40 mg/m2 chemotherapy, other investigators have tried to find another&#xD;
      optimal dose and dosing schedule for cisplatin administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In light of the results of the previous clinical trial that indicated 5-FU may not be an&#xD;
      active radiosensitizer, weekly cisplatin 40 mg/m2 and tri-weekly cisplatin 75 mg/m2 remain&#xD;
      the most popular cisplatin doses and dosing schedules. However, despite the possible&#xD;
      advantages of tri-weekly cisplatin 75 mg/m2, which offer an increased peak concentration of&#xD;
      cisplatin and cisplatin administration during brachytherapy, no clinical trials have efficacy&#xD;
      of tri-weekly cisplatin-based chemotherapy concurrent to RT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, the investigators are going to perform the efficacy study of postoperative,&#xD;
      tri-weekly cisplatin chemoradiation for patients with cervical cancer.&#xD;
