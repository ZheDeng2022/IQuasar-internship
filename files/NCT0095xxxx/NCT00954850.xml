    <textblock>
      The Canadian Severe Asthma Network (CSAN) was developed to gain a better understanding of the&#xD;
      clinical, environmental, socio-economic, work-related, and biological characteristics of&#xD;
      severe asthmatics (SA) that may account for poor response to clinically available therapies&#xD;
      for asthma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This network of clinical and basic researchers will be a means by which Canadian&#xD;
      investigators can develop and conduct research in this small patient group, which could lead&#xD;
      to better clinical management of SA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient information will be entered into the CSAN database (created by PI Dr. Vethanayagam in&#xD;
      connection with Mr. Jack Yeung) and will help researchers and doctors from multiple hospitals&#xD;
      and universities across Canada to understand this subpopulation of asthmatics better. It will&#xD;
      help to answer questions regarding SA epidemiology, asthma education, inflammatory&#xD;
      monitoring, risks of near fatal asthma (NFA), symptom perception, changes in lung structure&#xD;
      and function, co-morbidities, and the effectiveness of developing regional severe asthma&#xD;
      clinics. Two of the early projects the investigators will be working on are psychosocial&#xD;
      co-morbidities in asthma and medication coverage related to asthma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There will also be biobanking of sputum samples and/or bronchoscopy samples (such as BALs &amp;&#xD;
      lung washings) that are being obtained for clinical purposes. Also, for those consented for&#xD;
      biobanking blood and urine will be collected, separate from clinical care, and stored in the&#xD;
      biobank. The Canadian Biosample Repository (CBSR) will be storing our biobanked samples. The&#xD;
      investigators will be following the CBSR policies for storage and security. Tissue research&#xD;
      will be conducted in the future, and separate ethics approval will be obtained for each&#xD;
      project.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      5-10% of adult asthmatics have difficult to control asthma or severe asthma (SA), some of&#xD;
      whom require systemic steroids to control their disease (&quot;steroid dependent asthmatics&quot;).&#xD;
      Very little is understood about this population (Chanez, et al. JACI June 07)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Networks to study severe asthma have emerged in Europe (ENFUMOSA) and the United States (US&#xD;
      Severe Asthma Research Program) to understand this small group of patients who account for&#xD;
      the majority of costs related to asthma care (&gt;50%). We would like to establish a network in&#xD;
      Canada of well characterized asthmatics with severe asthma (and mild-moderate asthmatics as&#xD;
      controls).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sputum cell counts assist somewhat in improving asthma management in this population but&#xD;
      outside of eosinophilic inflammation (one subtype) do not predict asthma control (Lemiere C&#xD;
      et al. J Allergy Clin Immunol 2006;118:1033-9).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Little is understood regarding the many patients who do not have frequent exacerbations but&#xD;
      rather have chronic persistent asthma (symptoms multiple times a day) particularly when&#xD;
      non-eosinophilic. SCCs are not as useful within this group and more detailed analysis of&#xD;
      sputum (particularly supernatant) and more invasive testing is required as we see more of&#xD;
      this population, to better treat them.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Even less is understood about severe asthma in childhood.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We have been reviewing a few of the patients' biopsies for clues to how we can better manage&#xD;
      them within clinical setting and note significant differences between individuals in relation&#xD;
      to muscle mass, neuronal hypertrophy, and inflammation (which more often than not is absent&#xD;
      in those with severe asthma).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bronchoscopies are done routinely in SA patients to assess their airways better and obtain&#xD;
      bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) specimens and sometimes transbronchial biopsies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our hypotheses and/ or research questions are:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Immediate:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Natural History:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. What is the natural history of SA?&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. What proportion of patients with SA and MMA have had a prior NFA episode?&#xD;
                (retrospective)&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Do deaths due to asthma occur more commonly in Canadians with SA, as opposed to&#xD;
                those with MMA? (prospective)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. NFA and SA:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. What is the regional prevalence of NFA episodes in individuals with SA managed&#xD;
                within a Canadian Health Care System?&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. What is the natural history of patients with SA who have experienced an episode of&#xD;
                NFA?&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Does management of SA within SA Centres of Excellence (SA Centres) alter the risk&#xD;
                of subsequent episodes of NFA?&#xD;
&#xD;
             4. What genes are related to NFA in individuals with SA and MMA?&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. What is the burden of co-morbidities in individuals with SA as opposed to individuals&#xD;
           with MMA?&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. What is the burden of steroid-related complications in patients with SA?&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Immunology:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. What is the regional prevalence of atopy in SA?&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. What is the regional prevalence of non-TH2 mediated immunologic deviances in SA?&#xD;
&#xD;
           Future Projects once CSAN registry is established (with specific grant funding requests)&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Education:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. What are the unique educational needs of patients with SA that need to be resolved?&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Can we use the same translatable SA action plan in each SA Centre?&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Inflammatory monitoring:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. What are the barriers to implementing the use of sputum cell counts (SCCs)&#xD;
                routinely within SA Centres in Canada from a cost-benefit perspective?&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. What are the barriers to establishing a standard protocol for SCC monitoring&#xD;
                (frequency every 3 months) in SA Centres?&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Is there a role for Exhaled Nitric Oxide (ENO) measurement over and above SCC&#xD;
                monitoring in SA Centres for individuals with SA?&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. Symptom perception:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. How does the perception of dyspnea vary in patients with NFA and those with SA?&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Are there simple ways to identify patients with poor perception of dyspnea in this&#xD;
                high risk population?&#xD;
&#xD;
        9. Pathophysiology:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. What factors promote fixed airflow obstruction in this population?&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. What are the features that lead to persistent airway neutrophilia in this&#xD;
                population?&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Do those with SA develop more airway remodelling than those with MMA and when&#xD;
                present, does airway remodelling progress at a faster rate in the SA group?&#xD;
&#xD;
       10. Health Service Delivery:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Are there differences in organizational clinic structure of SA Centres that improve&#xD;
                efficiency of management?&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Can we develop further specialized new SA Centres in Canada effectively (knowledge&#xD;
                transfer for organization)?&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Is it cost effective to develop regional SA Centres in Canada?&#xD;
