      The aim of the study is to measure the effectiveness of treatment over 7 days with commonly&#xD;
      used anti-inflammatory medications namely etoricoxib and diclofenac (Voltaren) on reducing&#xD;
      the severity of pain, swelling and loss of function (range of movement, proprioception)&#xD;
      arising from a mild to moderate sprain (partial tear) of the lateral (outer) ligaments of the&#xD;
      ankle joint. This injury is commonly known as an ankle sprain.&#xD;

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age 18 to 45 years (Rationale: Most injuries occur in this age group, older subjects&#xD;
             are more likely to have concomitant pathology e.g. osteoarthrosis)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Acute lateral ankle ligament sprain less than 48 hours ago (Rationale: It is important&#xD;
             to standardize the phase of the injury and enter at the time of the maximum&#xD;
             inflammatory response, but this has to be balanced with enough time to allow injured&#xD;
             subjects to access the treatment facility, and that all measurements can be completed)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Grade II ankle sprain injury according to the following: (Rationale: Standard clinical&#xD;
             criteria are used to ensure that the severity of injury is similar in all subjects)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Mild to moderate pain (&gt; 40mm on the VAS)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Mild to moderate lateral ankle swelling (Greater than 5% increase in ankle volume&#xD;
                  compared with the uninjured side according to volumetric assessment)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Tenderness over the anterior talofibular ligament&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Negative urine and serum pregnancy test (females only) with signed undertaking on use&#xD;
             of adequate contraception for the duration of the trial (Rationale: This is to make&#xD;
             sure that no pregnant female subjects are entered or can become pregnant during the&#xD;
             trial as a safety precaution against drug use in pregnancy)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  No use of analgesics or oral or intramuscular anti-inflammatory drugs in the last 24&#xD;
             hours (Rationale: This is to ensure that at the time of the first assessment, no&#xD;
             subject has taken oral or intramuscular medication that may influence the initial&#xD;
             assessments of pain and swelling)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  No use of topical anti-inflammatory agents, ice application or compression in the last&#xD;
             12 hours (Rationale: This is to ensure that at the time of the first assessment, no&#xD;
             subject has taken topical medication, or used ice or compression that may influence&#xD;
             the initial assessments of pain and swelling)&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with a history of an ankle sprain in the previous 12 months (Rationale: A&#xD;
             recent previous injury in the ligaments may affect the healing of a new injury)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The presence of an ankle fracture as diagnosed on normal radiographs - using the&#xD;
             Ottowa ankle rules. (Rationale: This is to ensure that subjects only suffer from a&#xD;
             soft tissue injury, so that the study group is homogeneous)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have experienced bronchospasm, acute rhinitis, nasal polyps,&#xD;
             angioneurotic oedema, urticaria, or allergic-type reactions after taking&#xD;
             acetylsalicylic acid, NSAID's,(including COXIBS) , antipyretics or any of their&#xD;
             excipients. (Rationale: This is to ensure that no subject who has a history of&#xD;
             hypersensitivity to drugs is given drugs that may cause an allergic reaction)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have a sulphonamide allergy. (Rationale: This is to ensure that no&#xD;
             subject who has a history of hypersensitivity to certain drugs is given drugs that may&#xD;
             cause an allergic reaction)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Active peptic ulcer within the previous six months (Rationale: It is well established&#xD;
             that NSAID's have gastric irritation, gastritis, and ulceration with haemorrhage as&#xD;
             possible side effects. This is to ensure that subjects with a history of these&#xD;
             syndromes are not included as a safety issue)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of recurrent peptic (gastric or duodenal) ulcer (Rationale: It is well&#xD;
             established that NSAID's have gastric irritation, gastritis, and ulceration with&#xD;
             haemorrhage as possible side effects. This is to ensure that subjects with a history&#xD;
             of these syndromes are not included as a safety issue)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of any bleeding disorders, including gastrointestinal bleeding or&#xD;
             cerebrovascular bleeding (Rationale: It is well established that non-selective NSAID's&#xD;
             can decrease clotting. This is to ensure that subjects with a history of these&#xD;
             syndromes are not included as a safety issue)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with severe congestive heart failure (NYHA 3 - 4) (Rationale: The&#xD;
             administration of etoricoxib is contra-indicated in these patients)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with a medical history of ischemic heart disease or cerebrovascular disease.&#xD;
             (Rationale: There is a potential risk of cardiovascular events with COX-2 selective&#xD;
             inhibitor use, although this is only documented after long-term use (&gt;18 months).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of cardiac failure, left ventricular dysfunction, hypertension or pre-existing&#xD;
             oedema. (Rationale: Inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis, as caused by these drugs,&#xD;
             may cause fluid retention, oedema and hypertension.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with peripheral arterial disease (Rationale: Peripheral aerial disease will&#xD;
             alter the response to healing in the ankle ligaments)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with a history or current symptoms and clinical signs of severe impairment of&#xD;
             renal function (CrCl &lt;30 ml/min) or moderate to severe impairment of hepatic or&#xD;
             function (Rationale: The administration of etoricoxib 120 mg is contra-indicated in&#xD;
             these patients)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with inflammatory bowel disease. (Rationale: The administration of etoricoxib&#xD;
             is contra-indicated in these patients).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients consuming more than three alcoholic drinks per day, or patients with a&#xD;
             history of alcohol abuse (Rationale: Excessive alcohol intake could negatively affect&#xD;
             liver function, interfere with drug metabolism and reduce compliance to the protocol)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with hereditary problems of galactose intolerance, Lapp lactose deficiency or&#xD;
             glucose-galactose malabsorption. (Rationale; etoricoxib tablets contain lactose and is&#xD;
             therefore contraindicated in these patients)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Currently pregnant or lactating (Rationale: The administration of etoricoxib is&#xD;
             contra-indicated in these patients)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Woman attempting to conceive. (Rationale: Any drug known to inhibit COX-2 is&#xD;
             contra-indicated)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Concomitant treatment with anti-coagulants (including heparin, warfarin, and&#xD;
             ticlopidine) (Rationale: It is well established that NSAID's can decrease clotting.&#xD;
             This is to ensure that subjects with a history of established bleeding disorders or&#xD;
             those on anti-clotting therapy are not included as a safety issue).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Concomitant treatment with lithium, methotrexate, angiotensin converting enzyme&#xD;
             inhibitors, beta-blockers and diuretics) (Rationale: NSAID's have significant drug&#xD;
             interactions with some medications, can potentiate or impair the effects of others and&#xD;
             therefore patients on these medications are excluded for safety reasons).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Concomitant administration of other NSAID's (including aspirin doses &gt; 150 mg) or&#xD;
             analgesic agents (Rationale: The purpose of the study is to determine the effects of&#xD;
             specific NSAID's on pain and swelling. Concomitant use of other NSAID's will interfere&#xD;
             with outcome measures and these patients have to be excluded from the study)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Concomitant administration of cyclosporine and tacrolimus. (Rationale:&#xD;
             Co-administration of these medications with any NSAID's may increase their nephrotoxic&#xD;
             effects)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Concomitant treatment of etoricoxib with rifampicin. (Rationale: Rifampicin is a&#xD;
             potent inducer of CYP enzymes and produces a 65% decrease in etoricoxib plasma&#xD;
             concentration.)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Current treatment or treatment within the last two months with corticosteroids&#xD;
             (systemic, intra-articular) (Rationale: Long acting corticosteroids can interfere with&#xD;
             outcome measures and patients who received these medications have to be excluded from&#xD;
             the study)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participation in another clinical trial during this study or during the previous month&#xD;
             (Rationale: This is to ensure that patients who may still have effects from treatment&#xD;
             administered during another trial are not included)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Inability to comply with the protocol (Rationale: This is to exclude subjects who will&#xD;
             not be able to complete the study)&#xD;
