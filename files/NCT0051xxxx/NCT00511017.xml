      The goal of this clinical research study is to find the highest tolerable dose of&#xD;
      doxercalciferol that can be given to pediatric patients with relapsed solid tumors. The&#xD;
      safety of this drug will also be studied. Another goal is to measure the effect of the study&#xD;
      drug on the blood levels of calcium and vitamin D.&#xD;

      The Study Drug:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Doxercalciferol is designed to &quot;copy the actions&quot; of Vitamin D without causing blood levels&#xD;
      of calcium to be too high.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Drug Dose Level:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will begin receiving&#xD;
      doxercalciferol. The dose you will receive will be based on how many participants have been&#xD;
      enrolled before you, and on the safety data that is available. You will remain on the same&#xD;
      dose level throughout this study. There will be up to 9 participants enrolled in each group&#xD;
      of the same dose. The first group of participants enrolled on this study will be given small&#xD;
      doses of doxercalciferol. If no intolerable side effects are experienced, the next group of&#xD;
      participants will be enrolled at a higher dose level. This process will continue until&#xD;
      researchers find the highest tolerable dose of doxercalciferol, among the 5 dose levels being&#xD;
      tested, that can be given without intolerable side effects occurring.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Drug Administration:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will begin the first &quot;cycle&quot;&#xD;
      of the study drug. Each cycle of chemotherapy will last 28 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Doxercalciferol will be taken by mouth every day for 28 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Visits:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Every week during Cycle 1, you will have a physical exam, and urine will be collected for&#xD;
      routine tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two (2) times every week while you are on study, blood (about 2 teaspoons) will be drawn for&#xD;
      routine tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During Cycles 2 and beyond, you will have the following tests and procedures performed:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Urine will be collected for routine tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  ECG and ECHO will be repeated again only if your doctor feels it is necessary.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You may also have a computed tomography (CT) scan and/or magnetic resonance imaging&#xD;
           (MRI) to check the status of the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Length of Study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      You may remain on this study for up to 12 cycles.You will be taken off this study if the&#xD;
      disease gets worse or intolerable side effects occur. The study doctor may stop you from&#xD;
      taking part in this study at any time if he/she believes it is in your best interest or if&#xD;
      you do not follow the study rules.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You can stop participating in this study at any time. Tell the study doctor if you are&#xD;
      thinking about leaving the study so that any risks can be reviewed by your study doctor and&#xD;
      so that follow-up care and testing can be discussed. The study doctor will tell you how to&#xD;
      stop safely.&#xD;
&#xD;
      End-of-Study Visit:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once you are off-study, you will have an end-of-study visit. At this visit, the following&#xD;
      tests and procedures will be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a physical exam.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (around 2 teaspoons) and urine will be collected for routine tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You may also have a CT scan and/or MRI to check the status of the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Long-Term Follow-Up:&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the end-of-study visit, you will have a study visit every month for the first year and&#xD;
      then once a year for 10 years. At these visits, you will have a physical exam.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You may also have CT scans and/or MRIs every 8 weeks for the 1st 6 months, every 3 months for&#xD;
      the next year, then every 6 months for 1 1/2 years, and then at least 1 time a year after&#xD;
      that. This will be done to check the status of your disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Researchers would like to keep track of your medical condition and some general health&#xD;
      information about you through yearly follow-up visits, letters, and/or phone contact, for up&#xD;
      to 10 years. More information (such as other treatments and/or disease response) will be&#xD;
      collected if follow-up studies show changes in the disease or in your overall health.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the disease has gotten worse, researchers will keep track of which parts of your body are&#xD;
      involved. Researchers will also collect information about any other cancers or major organ&#xD;
      problems you might have developed. Keeping in touch with you and checking on your condition&#xD;
      will help researchers look at the long-term effects of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an investigational study. Doxercalciferol is FDA approved and commercially available&#xD;
      for reducing high levels of a hormone in patients undergoing chronic renal dialysis. Its use&#xD;
      in this study, for this disease, is investigational.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 24 patients will take part in the study. All will be enrolled at M. D. Anderson.&#xD;
