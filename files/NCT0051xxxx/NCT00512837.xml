    <textblock>
      Although asthma outcomes can be improved with structured care, less than half of people with&#xD;
      asthma achieve good control. Part of the problem is poor adherence with self-monitoring and&#xD;
      preventive drug regimes. This trial will test whether using mobile phone-based monitoring, as&#xD;
      part of a structured care plan, improves clinical outcomes and confidence in people with&#xD;
      poorly controlled asthma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adults and teenagers with poorly controlled asthma will be recruited and randomly assigned to&#xD;
      one of two groups. Those in the mobile phone group will monitor their asthma daily using&#xD;
      their mobile phone to record symptoms, medication and lung function. Instantaneous feedback&#xD;
      to their phone will provide a visual indication of asthma control and prompts about therapy.&#xD;
      The patient and their clinician will have web-based access to all readings. People in the&#xD;
      control group will use traditional paper-based monitoring. Under the care of their asthma&#xD;
      nurse, both groups will be treated according to the step-wise approach of the BTS/SIGN asthma&#xD;
      guideline in order to gain control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will use the validated Asthma Control Questionnaire to measure control at baseline, three&#xD;
      and six months, and compare improvement in the two groups. We will also assess how confident&#xD;
      people feel in controlling their asthma, using a validated measure of self-efficacy,&#xD;
      attitudes and knowledge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Technological solutions to long-term healthcare problems are increasingly being sought by&#xD;
      patients, clinicians and policy makers. If successful, our trial could provide timely&#xD;
      evidence for the use of information technology to address the long-recognised problem of poor&#xD;
      asthma control.&#xD;

      A. Hypothesis In teenagers and adults with poorly controlled asthma offered treatment&#xD;
      according to BTS-SIGN guideline, the use of mobile phone-based lung function and symptom&#xD;
      monitoring with patient feedback will improve the asthma control achieved and patient&#xD;
      self-efficacy at six-months compared to usual paper-based monitoring strategies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      B. Background Despite effective treatments, studies continue to demonstrate that asthma is&#xD;
      poorly controlled,1,2 though marked variation in the control achieved in UK general practices&#xD;
      suggests that improvement is possible for the vast majority of patients.3 Psychosocial&#xD;
      factors such as denial of illness, low outcome expectations 4,5 and hectic lifestyles,&#xD;
      exacerbated by limited knowledge, poor self-recognition of symptoms and discordant attitudes,&#xD;
      influence patients' ability to engage in self-management with resultant poor concordance with&#xD;
      monitoring and treatment.6,7 Interventions involving biofeedback can address these barriers&#xD;
      by objectively demonstrating symptom severity and the impact of medication compliance.8 A&#xD;
      Cochrane review demonstrates that self-management education linked with structured care&#xD;
      improves asthma outcomes.9 Despite self-management education,6 in real life, compliance with&#xD;
      traditional diary monitoring can be as low as 6%,10 and results are often fabricated.11&#xD;
      Electronic recording may improve compliance,12 with over two-thirds of potential readings&#xD;
      recorded over a 72-week trial.13 Increasingly pervasive throughout society, mobile phone&#xD;
      technology provides a convenient, portable communications medium. Mobile phone-based&#xD;
      monitoring with supporting biofeedback, appears able to engage patients in their management,&#xD;
      resulting in high levels of adherence and patient acceptability,13,14 with many patients&#xD;
      welcoming the innovative care.15,16,17,18 Integrated within a structured care protocol, this&#xD;
      has the potential to address the barriers of poor adherence and low expectations and thereby&#xD;
      to improve patient outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Monitoring is, in itself, an intervention which alters behaviour. The theoretical model&#xD;
      developed by Glasziou et al. describes the complementary and evolving roles of periodic&#xD;
      professional reviews and on-going patient self-monitoring.19 The monitoring of asthma with&#xD;
      lung function and/or symptoms is cited as a well-defined exemplar of this concept. Our recent&#xD;
      qualitative study suggests that people with asthma perceive a role for mobile technology in&#xD;
      aiding transition from clinician-supported phases while control is gained, to effective&#xD;
      self-management during maintenance phases.20 This approach resonates with two key health&#xD;
      service policies: the drive for technological solutions to healthcare problems;21 and the&#xD;
      importance of expert patients and self-management of long-term conditions.22,23 Our proposed&#xD;
      trial tests the hypothesis that through engaging the patient in self-monitoring with timely&#xD;
      biofeedback, mobile phone technology can improve the asthma control achieved at six months&#xD;
      compared to usual paper-based monitoring.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our multi-disciplinary team has extensive experience of tele-care, delivery of primary care&#xD;
      respiratory services, patient self-management, and research within general practice settings.&#xD;
      Building on extensive background work,3,13-15,17,18,20 we offer expertise in respiratory and&#xD;
      health services research, and social science and are ideally placed to undertake this trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Description of the mobile phone-based monitoring system (see figure) The system software (T+&#xD;
      asthma, Oxford, UK) can be loaded onto any web-enabled mobile phone. It permits recording of&#xD;
      symptoms, medication usage and lung function. Measurements are made with a Piko meter (a&#xD;
      prescribable electronic meter which records both (FEV1) and peak expiratory flow (PEF)). We&#xD;
      have opted to record FEV1 because it is a component of the ACQ,24 and the correlation between&#xD;
      Piko and spirometry FEV1 is excellent (r=0.98).25,26 Data transmitted to a remote server are&#xD;
      analysed and the latest reading returned to the mobile phone, compared with the preceding&#xD;
      week's recordings and a prompt for using 'preventer' medication. In addition, the patient and&#xD;
      their clinician can access the record via a password-protected website.C. Design of the&#xD;
      research A six month single-blinded randomised controlled trial&#xD;
&#xD;
      Practice recruitment Six/eight practices (total list 72,000 patients) will be recruited from&#xD;
      the Leicester area (local to the practice of a lead co-applicant). Eligible practices will&#xD;
      have an asthma-trained nurse able to commit to the additional clinical workload.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participant recruitment Practices will use the Minimal Asthma Assessment Tool (MAAT), which&#xD;
      interrogates routinely collected data on their computer database, using patterns of&#xD;
      medication usage, symptom control and biometric data to identify patients (12 years and over)&#xD;
      with poorly controlled asthma.3 Potential eligibility will be confirmed by inspection of&#xD;
      manual/computer records checking (and documenting) exclusion criteria: other significant lung&#xD;
      disease, under specialist care for severe/difficult asthma, unable to communicate in English&#xD;
      or use a mobile phone and at the request of the GP for other significant social/clinical&#xD;
      problems. The practice will invite all potentially eligible patients by post to participate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Confirmation of eligibility and baseline assessment Potential participants will attend a&#xD;
      screening assessment (normally in their practice) at which eligibility will be confirmed,&#xD;
      their current asthma control assessed using the ACQ,24 and suitability of their mobile phone&#xD;
      established. All patients with poorly controlled asthma (defined as ACQ&gt;1.5 27) will be&#xD;
      entered in the trial and a baseline assessment undertaken.(see summary table)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomisation Patients will be allocated, using centralised randomisation stratified by&#xD;
      practice, to mobile phone or paper-based monitoring. The University of Aberdeen's Health&#xD;
      Services Research Unit will provide a 24hr telephone randomisation service.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention group: Mobile phone based monitoring Patients in the intervention group will be&#xD;
      issued with a Piko meter and the T+ software loaded onto their mobile phone. They will be&#xD;
      asked to monitor symptoms, medication usage and FEV1 twice a day and submit the readings. The&#xD;
      web-record will be available to patient and asthma nurse to aid assessment of control during&#xD;
      routine reviews, and to the patients' GP in the event of unscheduled asthma consultations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Control group: paper-based monitoring Patients in the control group will be issued with a&#xD;
      Piko meter, and asked to keep a paper diary, recording symptoms, medication usage and FEV1&#xD;
      readings twice a day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical care and self-management education in both groups Structured care will be provided&#xD;
      by the practices' asthma nurse(s), trained in all aspects of the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical care in both groups will be in accordance with the step-wise approach of the&#xD;
      BTS-SIGN Guideline.28 Patients will be reviewed monthly until control is achieved as judged&#xD;
      by the nurse on the basis of clinical monitoring.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will receive a one-to-one standardised asthma education session, including&#xD;
      information on asthma, asthma treatment, inhaler technique, monitoring and when to seek&#xD;
      urgent assistance.&#xD;
