      The purpose of this study is to determine the effectiveness of 1.25% povidone-iodine&#xD;
      ophthalmic solution for the treatment of small to medium sized fungal corneal ulcers compared&#xD;
      with an antifungal antibiotic.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The medication to be studied is 1.25% povidone-iodine solution and the control medication is&#xD;
      5% natamycin ophthalmic suspension. The povidone-iodine concentration of 1.25% was chosen&#xD;
      based on a study using povidone-iodine ophthalmic solution for the first week after ocular&#xD;
      surgery. Initially, some patients complained of a stinging sensation when using the 2.5%&#xD;
      concentration. This might prevent full compliance from some subjects. When the solution was&#xD;
      diluted to 1.25%, there were no more complaints of discomfort. Therefore, in the actual&#xD;
      one-week postoperative clinical trial, the 1.25 % concentration was used without any patient&#xD;
      complaints and it was found to be effective. In a pilot study conducted in the Philippines,&#xD;
      investigating treatment of small to medium-sized fungal corneal ulcers, 1.25% povidone-iodine&#xD;
      was shown to be effective against fungal corneal ulcers including those caused by Fusarium&#xD;
      solani and Mycelia sterila when treated for 7-20 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The povidone-iodine 1.25% solution will be prepared by removing 1.875 ml. of solution from a&#xD;
      15 ml. bottle of Balanced Salt Solution (BSS), (Alcon Laboratories, Inc., Fort Worth) and&#xD;
      inserting 1.875 ml. of a 10% povidone-iodine solution (Betadine solution, Purdue Frederick,&#xD;
      Norwalk). Preparations will be made weekly for each subject using sterile technique and are&#xD;
      to be stored in a cool dark place. The control anti-fungal will be natamycin ophthalmic&#xD;
      suspension, USP 5% (Natamet, M.J. Pharmaceuticals Ltd., Mumbai, India), which represents the&#xD;
      current standard of care. The subjects will be discharged home on the same randomized&#xD;
      medication that they were assigned while hospitalized.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prospective candidates for the study, and/or their parent or guardian, will review the&#xD;
      appropriate Human Subjects Consent Form, approved by the Human Subjects Protection Committee&#xD;
      of the Harbor-UCLA Medical Center. After written consents, Informed and HIPPA, are obtained,&#xD;
      each subject will be randomized to receive either povidone-iodine or the control drug. All&#xD;
      subjects will be hospitalized for a minimum duration of 7 days for careful monitoring and&#xD;
      appropriate treatment. To assure compliance, all these inpatient subjects will have their&#xD;
      medications administered by medical personnel. Upon admission, the intake clinical&#xD;
      examination will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each infected eye will be randomly assigned by the research nurse to be treated with&#xD;
      povidone-iodine 1.25% or the control, anti-fungal medication natamycin. Randomization will be&#xD;
      achieved by using random number generated randomization schedules. To guarantee similar&#xD;
      distribution will occur, and not be left to chance, each study site randomization schedule&#xD;
      will be stratified on ulcer sizes &lt; 3mm. and &gt; 3mm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The only eye medications permitted beside povidone-iodine 1.25% ophthalmic solution and the&#xD;
      control drug natamycin, will be atropine ophthalmic solution to reduce intraocular&#xD;
      inflammation and prevent synechiae, and anti-glaucoma medication as needed. The atropine will&#xD;
      be administered to the affected eye(s) twice a day and strength will vary according to the&#xD;
      subject's age. Subjects less than 1 year of age will be given atropine 0.25%, ages 1-3 will&#xD;
      be given 0.5%, and subjects greater than 3 years of age will be given 1%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The dosing schedule of povidone-iodine 1.25% or control medication is as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. For the first three days, one drop of the medication will be applied every hour.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Day 4 and thereafter, hourly while awake, when asleep, every three hours. Sleep is not&#xD;
           to exceed 9 hours. Treat all cases with intense drop therapy for a minimum of 5 days&#xD;
           unless criteria for change in therapy are met.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. At 5 days, decrease dosing frequency to every 2 hours while awake until &quot;cured&quot;, only if&#xD;
           no deterioration in any factor and improved in at least one factor, other than&#xD;
           epithelial defect, is noted on 2 consecutive examinations.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. If at 10 days the status remains unchanged, the subject is to exit the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. After discharge, dosing frequency is to remain every 2 hours while awake until cured.&#xD;
