      RATIONALE: Biliary stenting is the placement of a tube in the bile ducts to keep a blocked&#xD;
      area open. Photodynamic therapy uses a drug, such as porfimer sodium, that is absorbed by&#xD;
      tumor cells. The drug becomes active when it is exposed to light. When the drug is active,&#xD;
      tumor cells are killed. It is not yet known whether biliary stenting is more effective with&#xD;
      or without photodynamic therapy in treating patients with biliary tract tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE: This randomized phase III trial is studying biliary stenting to see how well it&#xD;
      works compared with biliary stenting and photodynamic therapy using porfimer sodium in&#xD;
      treating patients with locally advanced, recurrent, or metastatic cholangiocarcinoma or other&#xD;
      biliary tract tumors that cannot be removed by surgery.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the efficacy, in terms of overall survival, of biliary stenting with vs&#xD;
           without photodynamic therapy using porfimer sodium in advanced, recurrent, or metastatic&#xD;
           biliary tract carcinoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the two treatments arms with respect to progression-free survival, toxicity&#xD;
           using NCI Common Toxicity Criteria (version 3.0), and quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified by participating center,&#xD;
      primary site (gallbladder vs bile duct), disease stage (locally advanced vs metastatic),&#xD;
      prior therapy (i.e., surgery, radiotherapy or chemotherapy) (yes vs no), performance score (0&#xD;
      vs 1 vs 2 vs 3), and prior treatment arm on UK chemotherapy trial ABC-02 (gemcitabine&#xD;
      hydrochloride alone vs gemcitabine hydrochloride and cisplatin). Patients are randomized to 1&#xD;
      of 2 arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Arm I: Patients undergo either endoscopic or percutaneous drainage and insertion of&#xD;
           unilateral or bilateral plastic endoprostheses above the main strictures of the right&#xD;
           and left hepatic bile ducts.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Arm II: Patients undergo treatment as in arm I. Patients also receive porfimer sodium IV&#xD;
           and then undergo laser activation 48 hours later.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 3 months for at least 3&#xD;
      years.&#xD;
