  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This will be a multi-institution, single-arm, open-label, phase I/II trial. Eligible patients&#xD;
      will have pathologically-proven T1b-3b, N0/1, M0 epithelial carcinoma of the cervix. We&#xD;
      hypothesize that sorafenib in combination with chemotherapy and radiotherapy may have&#xD;
      anti-tumor activity in patients with cervical cancer. Sorafenib has not previously been&#xD;
      combined with conventional RT-CT to treat cervix cancer.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      During the phase I component of the study, low risk patients (tumor size â‰¤5 cm and&#xD;
      radiographically node negative) will receive sorafenib alone in escalating doses for at least&#xD;
      1 week prior to the start of conventional treatment with radiotherapy and chemotherapy&#xD;
      (RT-CT). High risk patients (tumor &gt; 5 cm or node positive) will receive sorafenib alone in&#xD;
      escalating dose for at least 1 week prior to the start of RT-CT, as well as concurrently with&#xD;
      RT-CT. Cohorts of 3 patients per dose level are planned. If 1/3 patients encounters a&#xD;
      dose-limiting toxicity (DLT), then that cohort will be expanded to 6 patients. If &gt;2/3 of&#xD;
      patients encounter a DLT, then that dose level will be declared as the maximum tolerated dose&#xD;
      (MTD). An additional 3 patients will be entered into the dose level one below the MTD. The&#xD;
      recommended phase II dose (RPTD) is defined as the dose level with &lt; 1/6 patients with DLT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the phase II component, all patients will receive sorafenib at the RPTD for at least 1&#xD;
      week prior to, and concurrent with, RT-CT.&#xD;

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have biopsy-proven epithelial carcinoma of the cervix, T1B-3B, N0/1, M0&#xD;
             with visible or palpable disease and a decision to treat radically with radiotherapy&#xD;
             and concurrent cisplatin chemotherapy (RT-CT).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  ECOG performance status 0, 1 or 2 (Karnofsky&gt;=60%)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Life expectancy of greater than 12 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have normal organ and marrow function as defined below:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Leukocytes &gt;3,000/mcL&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Absolute neutrophil count &gt;1,500/mcL&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Platelets &gt;100,000/mcL&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Hemoglobin &gt; 9 g/dL&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Total bilirubin Within normal institutional limits&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  AST(SGOT)/ALT(SGPT) &lt;=2.5 X institutional upper limit of normal&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Creatinine Within normal institutional limits, or&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Creatinine clearance &gt;60 mL/min/1.73 m2 for patients with creatinine levels above&#xD;
                  normal&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  No prior treatment for cervix cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The effects of sorafenib on the developing human fetus at the recommended therapeutic&#xD;
             dose are unknown. Although radical RT-CT for cervix cancer is not compatible with&#xD;
             survival of a developing fetus, women of child-bearing potential must agree to use&#xD;
             adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior&#xD;
             to study entry and for the duration of study participation. Should a woman become&#xD;
             pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while participating in this study, she should&#xD;
             inform her treating physician immediately.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  No active malignancy at another site.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients may not be receiving any other investigational agents concurrently or within&#xD;
             4 weeks. Patients who have previous exposure to a raf-kinase inhibitor are excluded&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with poorly controlled hypertension (systolic blood pressure of 140 mmHg or&#xD;
             higher, or diastolic blood pressure of 90 mmHg or higher) are ineligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with any condition that impairs their ability to swallow sorafenib tablets&#xD;
             are excluded (e.g. gastrointestinal tract disease resulting in an inability to take&#xD;
             oral medication or a requirement for IV alimentation, prior surgical procedures&#xD;
             affecting absorption, or active peptic ulcer disease).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Bleeding disorders. Patients cannot be receiving therapeutic anticoagulation.&#xD;
             Prophylactic anticoagulation (ie. low dose warfarin) of venous or arterial access&#xD;
             devices is allowed provided that the requirements for PT, INR, or PTT are met.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with known brain metastases should be excluded because of their poor&#xD;
             prognosis and because they often develop progressive neurologic dysfunction that would&#xD;
             confound the evaluation of neurologic and other adverse events. These patients would&#xD;
             not be eligible for radical RT-CT for cervix cancer, but instead would be treated for&#xD;
             palliation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with intercurrent cardiac dysfunction including, but not limited to,&#xD;
             symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, or cardiac arrhythmia&#xD;
             are excluded as are those with a history of ischemic heart disease including&#xD;
             myocardial infarction.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active&#xD;
             infection or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with&#xD;
             study requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because sorafenib has the potential for&#xD;
             teratogenic or abortifacient effects as shown by the gross fetal malformations and&#xD;
             effects on embryo-fetal survival seen in reproductive toxicity studies in the rat.&#xD;
             Because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants&#xD;
             secondary to treatment of the mother with sorafenib, breastfeeding should be&#xD;
             discontinued if the mother is treated with sorafenib.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  HIV-positive patients on combination antiretroviral therapy are ineligible because of&#xD;
             the potential for pharmacokinetic interactions with sorafenib. In addition, these&#xD;
             patients are at increased risk of lethal infections when treated with&#xD;
             marrow-suppressive therapy. Appropriate studies will be undertaken in patients&#xD;
             receiving combination antiretroviral therapy when indicated.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A decision to treat with extended-field pelvic and para-aortic radiotherapy,&#xD;
             specifically cases where the para-aortic field will extend cranial to the L3-4&#xD;
             vertebral inter-space.&#xD;
