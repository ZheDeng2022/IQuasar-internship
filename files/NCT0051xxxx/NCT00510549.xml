  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      As the influence of type of dialysis on survival of end stage renal disease (ESRD) patients&#xD;
      remains unanswered, the present study is designed (randomized, prospective, multicenter,&#xD;
      interventional) to assess clinical outcomes, and compare mortality, morbidity, Quality of&#xD;
      Life (QOL) and cost effectiveness between maintenance In-center Hemodialysis (ICHD) and&#xD;
      Continuous Ambulatory Peritoneal dialysis (CAPD). These data will ultimately bring clarity on&#xD;
      whether or not any difference in patient survival exists between the two modalities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to test the feasibility of patients' willingness to be randomized to two different&#xD;
      modality groups and retained in the randomized group, a pilot study is planned before the&#xD;
      conduct of a main study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This pilot study comprises of a 6 months study, plus a 6 months observation if there is&#xD;
      possibility to switch the patients into the main study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All ESRD patients requiring dialysis treatment within 8 weeks after a pre-study visit will be&#xD;
      recorded in each site. Patients who provide written inform consent for collecting relevant&#xD;
      information will be screened using certain inclusion/exclusion criteria. Eligible patients&#xD;
      will undergo a standardized education regarding ESRD and treatment options. Thereafter the&#xD;
      patient will be required to provide a second inform consent allowing for randomization and&#xD;
      entrance into the study. Eligible patient will be randomized to either PD or HD treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients will be followed for a period of 6 months, during which patients will be treated&#xD;
      with PD or HD as prescribed at each site, while meeting the dialysis adequacy and other&#xD;
      indicators. For the first 3 months monthly visits are required, after which an every 3 months&#xD;
      visit is planned.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this pilot study, the main objective is to assess the willingness of ESRD patients to be&#xD;
      randomized to either PD or HD treatment; thereby determining if an adequate number of&#xD;
      eligible patients can be recruited for a future large-scale study.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Male or female patients who are at least 18 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Patients who have read, understood and given written informed consent after the nature&#xD;
             of the study has been explained.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Patients who have a diagnosis of ESRD (GFR â‰¤ 10 ml/min), without a permanent access&#xD;
             for dialysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Patients who are able to comprehend a modality education program.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Patients who are judged as capable of being trained for home based PD.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Patients as justified by their physicians requiring dialysis treatment within 6 weeks&#xD;
             after randomization (Patients who require urgent temporary dialysis before&#xD;
             randomization may also be eligible for recruitment after being stabilized with&#xD;
             temporary HD or PD)&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Patients who are expected to remain on dialysis for at least 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;

             for back-up purposes, or for acute treatment for life threatening uremic symptoms,&#xD;
             electrolyte abnormalities or fluid overload, this does not exclude the patient from&#xD;
