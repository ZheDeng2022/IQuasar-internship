  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: Sixteen melanoma patients (1 stage IIC, 8 stage III, and 7 stage IV) were treated&#xD;
      in a Phase I study to evaluate safety and immune responses, with a vaccine (DC/Apo-Nec)&#xD;
      composed of autologous dendritic cells (DCs) loaded with a mixture of apoptotic/necrotic&#xD;
      melanoma cell lines (Apo-Nec).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: PBMC were obtained from leukapheresis and DCs were generated from monocytes cultured&#xD;
      in the presence of GM-CSF and IL-4 in serum-free medium. Immature DCs (iDCs) were loaded with&#xD;
      gamma-irradiated Apo-Nec cells and injected id without adjuvant. Cohorts of four patients&#xD;
      were given four vaccines with 5, 10, 15, or 20 x106 DC/Apo-Nec per vaccine, two weeks apart.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Results: The vaccine was well tolerated in all patients. Toxicity to vaccine was mild, and&#xD;
      the toxicity-limiting dose has not been reached. We found that 42.3 ±13.7 % melanoma&#xD;
      patients´ iDCs were able to phagocyte Apo-Nec cells wich induced DCs maturation, as evidenced&#xD;
      by increased expression of CD83, CD80, CD86, HLA class I and II compared to iDCs. Also, after&#xD;
      phagocytosis, a 75.2 ±16 % reduction in Dextran-FITC endocytosis was observed compared to&#xD;
      iDCs. CCR7 was upregulated upon Apo-Nec phagocytosis in DCs from all patients and accordingly&#xD;
      in vitro DC/Apo-Nec cells were able to migrate towards MIP-3 beta. The DTH score increased&#xD;
      significatively in the patients after the first vaccination and slightly decreased by the&#xD;
      fourth vaccine (Mann-Whitney Test, p&lt;0.05). For patient #1 a positive DTH reaction was&#xD;
      detected to her own tumor irradiated cells. The presence of CD8+ T lymphocytes specific to&#xD;
      gp100 and Melan A/MART-1 Ags were studied by tetramers binding in HLA-A*0201 patients (7 /15&#xD;
      patients) before and after vaccination. Two patients who remain NED increased Ags their&#xD;
      specific T lymphocytes after vaccination. No humoral responses to Apo-Nec cells were&#xD;
      detected. With a mean follow-up of 44.5 months post-surgery, the stage IIC pt is NED, 7/8&#xD;
      stage III pts are NED and 7/7 stage IV patients have progressed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Conclussions: We conclude that DC/Apo-Nec vaccine is well tolerated, it induces specific&#xD;
      immunity against melanoma Ags and in stage III patients it may prolong disease-free survival,&#xD;
      affording protection from relapse in an adjuvant setting.&#xD;
