    <textblock>
      Syncope (commonly called collapses or blackouts) is defined as loss of consciousness which is&#xD;
      transient, self limiting and usually leads to falling.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While the causes of syncope encompass a wide variety of factors, those due to heart rhythm&#xD;
      abnormalities are acknowledged to be significantly more serious compared with other causes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main aim of the study is to see if it is possible to find the cause of a patient's&#xD;
      syncope faster using a device called an implantable loop recorder (ILR), which is implanted&#xD;
      under the skin, versus conventional management. The device is slightly larger than a 50 pence&#xD;
      coin and records the rhythm of the heart continuously.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although ILRs are being used widely today, we want to use a new model that is able to relay&#xD;
      information to the doctor via wireless technology and internet.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We also want to use ILRs earlier in diagnosing syncope, thereby avoiding unnecessary and&#xD;
      lengthy hospital admissions and lowering cost.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary aim: To see how soon the ILR detects abnormal heart rhythms or normal ones (in study&#xD;
      subjects who faint/ suffer syncope).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary aims are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To see how soon treatment is started once the abnormal rhythm is detected by the ILR.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To see which group (patients with ILRs or those receiving conventional tests) receives&#xD;
           treatment sooner.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To see which group has less subsequent collapses i.e has benefited from appropriate&#xD;
           treatment sooner.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To assess the cost effectiveness of using the implantable loop recorder more as a&#xD;
           diagnostic tool for syncope versus conventional management (it should save many hospital&#xD;
           admissions).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The original EaSyAS study (1998) evaluated the use of implantable loop recorders (ILRs) in&#xD;
      the diagnosis and management of syncope.This demonstrated a significant increase in&#xD;
      successful diagnosis following use of implantable loop recorders. Here there were 442 syncope&#xD;
      admissions to Eastbourne in 2001. Diagnostic rate was 42%. In addition, time to diagnosis was&#xD;
      quicker and therefore so was introduction of therapy. This resulted in significant increase&#xD;
      in time to recurrent syncopal episodes and improved general wellbeing in an unselected&#xD;
      population with syncope of an unknown cause.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The &quot;Post-EaSyAS&quot; study evaluated extended (2.5 years) follow up of these patients. The&#xD;
      &quot;Tis-EaSyAS&quot; study evaluated 3 different tilt protocols with long term ILR follow up&#xD;
      describing the positive predictive value of tilt testing in unexplained syncope.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The EaSyAS II study elaborates further the above by using the ILR to avoid hospital admission&#xD;
      and optimise the use of a falls/syncope clinic, potentially improving cost effective&#xD;
      diagnosis and management of syncope.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ILRs will be implanted without patient admission and with follow up in a syncope/falls&#xD;
      assessment clinic, compared to optimal protocol driven current management.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The ILR used has capabilities to record and transmit heart rhythm abnormalities to a wireless&#xD;
      receiver which will then relay the information to the clinician via the internet. It is hoped&#xD;
      that this will shorten diagnosis times and speed up commencement of treatment for patients,&#xD;
      and will avoid expensive tests and more expensive hospital admissions.&#xD;
