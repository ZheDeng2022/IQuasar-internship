      Study Hypothesis: Do certain risk behaviours impact/predict levels of HIV antiretroviral&#xD;
      adherence?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess risk behavior in HIV-positive individuals receiving highly active&#xD;
           antiretroviral therapy.(HAART)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess levels of adherence in the same subjects at the same time point&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine if there is a correlation between HAART adherence and risk behaviour&#xD;

      Background and Rationale:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adherence to an effective antiretroviral (ARV) regimen is the most important determinant of&#xD;
      treatment success in patients receiving ARV. It is now well established that virological&#xD;
      suppression on highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) requires strict adherence to&#xD;
      prescribed dosing schedules. It is essential to reach and maintain therapeutic levels of&#xD;
      these drugs, and strict adherence is particularly crucial for preventing the development of&#xD;
      drug-resistant viral strains. If therapeutic drugs levels are suboptimal and the virus is&#xD;
      able to replicate, this has important individual and public health implications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Indirect evidence also suggests that the use of HAART by HIV-infected individuals decreases&#xD;
      sexual transmission of HIV. Specifically, ARV treatment decreases serum and genital fluid HIV&#xD;
      viral load. It has become evident that the availability of HAART may paradoxically increase&#xD;
      sexual practices that lead to HIV transmission. This has been seen in several developed&#xD;
      countries where the introduction of HAART coincided with increasing sexual risk behaviour and&#xD;
      sexually transmitted infections. Thus far there has been very little evidence showing these&#xD;
      trends in developing countries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite the high burden on HIV in developing countries compared with developed countries,&#xD;
      considerably more evidence is available in the latter regarding adherence and risk behaviour.&#xD;
      Studies to ascertain the correlation between these two factors are important as new&#xD;
      interventions may be established to ensure that improved health and economic outcomes will&#xD;
      follow. Understanding which patients have increased risk behaviours, or are at risk for&#xD;
      non-adherence enables identification of patients who are important targets for interventional&#xD;
      strategies to optimise HIV treatment programmes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adherence and risk behaviour:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Apart from the beneficial clinical effects of HAART, treatment advances may have unintended&#xD;
      effects on sexual behaviour. Evidence suggests that since HAART became available, the&#xD;
      prevalence of unprotected sex and the incidence of sexually transmitted infections including&#xD;
      HIV have increased, mostly among men who have sex with men (MSM). Some HIV positive persons&#xD;
      receiving HAART, especially those with a undetectable viral load, may feel protected from&#xD;
      transmitting HIV sexually. Recent evidence does suggest that an undetectable viral load may&#xD;
      reduce the level of infectiousness of HIV positive persons receiving HAART.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As this information moves into the public domain it may influence peoples beliefs about HIV&#xD;
      transmission and lessen concern about engaging in unsafe sex. People who hold these beliefs&#xD;
      are more likely than their counterparts to engage in unprotected sex.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HIV positive patients who engage in high-risk behaviours linked to HIV spread are as likely&#xD;
      to be receiving HAART as those at low risk for disease transmission, but those who engage in&#xD;
      high-risk behaviours have much lower rates of medication adherence and thus much higher viral&#xD;
      loads. This suggests a strong behavioural basis for transmission of drug resistant HIV, and&#xD;
      parallels recent increases in all sexually transmitted infections. Given that taking HAART&#xD;
      and having an undetectable viral load do not eliminate the possibility of transmitting HIV,&#xD;
      it is important to examine whether the use of HAART and beliefs about HAART are associated&#xD;
      with sexual risk taking.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Definitions:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Risk behavior is defined as behavior which may result in transmission of HIV&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study subjects:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be asked to complete a questionnaire which will contain questions on adherence&#xD;
      and risk behaviour.At the completion of data collection an analysis will be made accordingly.&#xD;
      Approximately 700 patients in HIV-NAT 006 who provide consent will be enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Age ≥ 18 years&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  HIV seropositive.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  On continuous HAART for at least 6 months&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Signed written informed consent&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cross sectional survey of adherence and behavior in subjects enrolled in the HIVNAT 006 long&#xD;
      term follow up cohort.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients enrolled in HIVNAT 006 are normally required to attend regular 6 monthly follow up&#xD;
      appointments. Over the coming months 700 subjects who give consent will be asked to complete&#xD;
      an anonymous self-administered questionnaire at their next clinic visit. Completion of the&#xD;
      questionnaire will be facilitated by people living with HIV/AIDS (PLHA) who will be trained&#xD;
      by HIVNAT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The questionnaire will comprise the following categories:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Demographics&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Medication adherence&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Factors affecting adherence (risk behaviour)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Furthermore the following will be extracted from the HIVNAT database:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  CDC disease stage over the previous 12 months and at current consult&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  CD4 over the previous 12 months and at current consult&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  VL over the previous 12 months and at current consult&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  ARV regimen and changes in regimen&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Opportunistic infections&#xD;
