    <textblock>
      This is a pilot study designed to evaluate the safety and feasibility of performing umbilical&#xD;
      cord blood transplants in older adults or younger infirm patients with high-risk&#xD;
      hematopoeitic malignancies. A novel reduced-intensity preparative regimen for umbilical cord&#xD;
      blood transplantation will be used. One to a maximum of three cord blood units, depending on&#xD;
      cell count, will be administered to facilitate engraftment. Ten patients will be enrolled&#xD;
      with an expected accrual rate of 3-4 patients per year and with a goal of completing accrual&#xD;
      within 2-3 years.&#xD;

      Primary Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the feasibility of performing umbilical cord blood transplants in older adults&#xD;
           or younger infirm patients using a reduced-intensity preparative regimen. Feasibility of&#xD;
           the procedure is defined as an engraftment rate of &gt;80% at Day 180 post-transplantation&#xD;
           and a transplant related mortality (TRM) of &lt;50% at Day 100. A TRM of &gt;50% will be&#xD;
           considered unacceptable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To describe the time to neutrophil and platelet recovery following mini-UCB&#xD;
           transplantation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess lineage-specific chimerism following transplantation and to describe the&#xD;
           contribution of each individual CB unit to post-transplantation hematopoeisis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To describe disease-specific, event-free and overall survival rates at 180 and 360 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To describe the incidence, severity, and timing of acute and chronic GVHD following&#xD;
           reduced-intensity UCB transplantation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate T-cell, B-cell, and NK cell recovery following reduced-intensity UCB&#xD;
           transplantation.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Age 55-70 years, or &lt; 55 years if deemed ineligible for conventional high dose&#xD;
             chemotherapy by the UCSF SCT Committee or by protocol eligibility requirements for&#xD;
             myeloablative therapy. Reasons for ineligibility for myeloablative therapy include:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Poor cardiac function (i.e. LVEF &lt; 40%)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Poor pulmonary function (i.e. DLCO &lt; 50%)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Hepatic dysfunction&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Prior myeloablative therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Availability of donor cord blood (one to three units) matching at &gt; or equal to 4 of 6&#xD;
             HLA antigens (A, B, and DR). HLA class I antigens will be determined by serologic&#xD;
             methods, and Class II antigens will be determined by high-resolution DNA typing.&#xD;
             Typing will be confirmed by the UCSF Immunogenetics Department. The target UCB TNC&#xD;
             dose is &gt; or equal to 3.5 x 10(7) TNC/kg recipient weight, however the absolute&#xD;
             minimum TNC requirement is &gt; 2.5 x 10(7) TNC per kilogram) based on cell counts prior&#xD;
             to cryopreservation. Cord blood units will be obtained from all available&#xD;
             international banks.&#xD;
