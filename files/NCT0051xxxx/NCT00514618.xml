      A. Null Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In term pregnancies complicated by diabetes, there is no difference in the time interval from&#xD;
      start of induction to delivery when outpatient cervical ripening and labor induction is&#xD;
      initiated with orally administered misoprostol, a prostaglandin El analogue, compared to&#xD;
      placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      B. Specific aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Demonstrate that oral misoprostol is effective for cervical ripening compared to placebo&#xD;
           when given in an outpatient basis to women with pregnancies complicated by diabetes&#xD;
           mellitus.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Demonstrate that oral misoprostol can be administered safely in an outpatient setting.&#xD;
           The patients will be observed for a period of four hours in an outpatient antepartum&#xD;
           testing unit after the medication is administered to demonstrate fetal well being and&#xD;
           verify that there is no evidence of uterine hyperstimulation. (We acknowledge that&#xD;
           markers of serious adverse maternal and neonatal outcomes are rare, and can only be&#xD;
           adequately addressed in large multicenter trials.)&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Assess the cost differential in inpatient and outpatient utilization of misoprostol for&#xD;
           cervical ripening and labor induction. In order to estimate the impact that outpatient&#xD;
           cervical ripening may have on total hospitalization costs, we will use daily hospital&#xD;
           charges and published data regarding pharmaceutical costs.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study proposed is a single center study. Study participants will be recruited from the&#xD;
      high risk obstetrical diabetic resident clinic, the Magella Women's Perinatal Group, and&#xD;
      Fetal Diagnostics at Miller Children's hospital. The resident clinic is supervised by the&#xD;
      faculty from the division of Maternal Fetal Medicine from the department of Obstetrics and&#xD;
      Gynecology. Patients with class A1, A2 diabetes mellitus at term who are usually considered&#xD;
      for inpatient cervical ripening and labor induction will be approached for participation in&#xD;
      the study. Informed consent will be obtained by members of the perinatal research team.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One hundred twenty-eight patients will be enrolled to assess treatment efficacy. Sixty four&#xD;
      patients will be treated with misoprostol 50mcg PO q day for two days (days 1 and 4) and&#xD;
      sixty four patients will receive placebo (vitamin C) q day for two days (days 1 and 4) for&#xD;
      cervical ripening and labor induction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size calculations were performed assuming that 50% of untreated patients will deliver&#xD;
      within 7 days of entry. Using an estimate that a 50% increase in this number to 75% would be&#xD;
      clinically important, and assuming a Type I error of 0.05 and a Type II error of 0.2, we&#xD;
      calculated that a sample size of 58 patients in each group was necessary. The test was&#xD;
      one-sided. Assuming a 10% loss to follow-up rate, sixty four patients will be needed in each&#xD;
      group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A predetermined randomization schedule for the 128 patients has been established and the&#xD;
      randomization assignments placed in opaque, sealed envelopes. The randomization was performed&#xD;
      using a computer-generated random number table. The pharmacy will prepare and distribute the&#xD;
      study medication according to the randomization schedule after eligible participants sign the&#xD;
      informed consent. Once a patient is randomized, the pharmacy will be contacted to provide the&#xD;
      medications to the research/antepartum testing unit nurse.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed study length is two years, or the time needed to enroll 128 total participants.&#xD;
      Each individual's total participation time is that needed to complete the protocol. After&#xD;
      delivery, the prenatal and hospital charts of each participant will be reviewed and data&#xD;
      abstracted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outpatient Procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Initial complete history and physical exam by physicians in the clinics, including&#xD;
           cervical exam.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The patients will be sent to the antepartum testing unit to undergo a non-stress test&#xD;
           and amniotic fluid index measurement as indicators of fetal well-being.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Candidates will be approached for study participation and informed consent obtained.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. The pharmacy will be contacted for randomization and provision of the study medications.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. A research nurse or physician, trained in labor and delivery, will be responsible for&#xD;
           administration of the study medication (50 mcg misoprostol or placebo).&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. The patient will be observed in the antepartum testing unit for a period of 4 hours&#xD;
           after receipt of the study medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Adequate uterine activity will be defined as &gt;=3 uterine contractions (UC's) in 10&#xD;
                minutes. Inadequate uterine activity will be defined as &lt;=2/10 minutes. Continued&#xD;
                adequate uterine activity will require continued observation on the labor and&#xD;
                delivery unit. If there is cessation of uterine activity while under observation on&#xD;
                labor and delivery and the fetal heart rate pattern remains reassuring, the patient&#xD;
                will be discharged home to return in three to four days for a second dose of&#xD;
                medication or oxytocin, as appropriate.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Adequate cervical ripening: If, following receipt of the medication, a patient&#xD;
                demonstrates a change in cervical score to &gt;6, she will be admitted for delivery.&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. If spontaneous labor ensues, or the patient demonstrates uterine hyperstimulation,&#xD;
                she will be transferred to the labor and delivery unit.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. If after the period of observation, the fetal heart rate testing remains reassuring and&#xD;
           the patient is not in labor or developed an adequate contraction pattern, she will be&#xD;
           discharged home.&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. If discharged home, the patient will be instructed to return 3 or 4 days later&#xD;
           (coincident with standard antepartum testing protocol) for re-evaluation for a second&#xD;
           dose of the study medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
        9. On the second day coincident with antepartum testing, a repeat cervical examination will&#xD;
           be performed by a research nurse, resident or attendant physician. Non Stress Test will&#xD;
           be performed. If the Bishop score is &gt;6, the patient will be admitted to labor and&#xD;
           delivery for oxytocin augmentation of her labor. If the Bishop score is less than this,&#xD;
           the Non Stress Test is reactive, amniotic fluid index normal, and uterine activity is&#xD;
           minimal, she will be administered a second dose of 50 mcg of oral misoprostol.&#xD;
           Observation in the antepartum testing unit will be for 4 hours. Again, if labor does not&#xD;
           ensue and the fetal heart rate remains reassuring, the patient will be sent home again&#xD;
           with instructions to return 3-4 days later coincident with standard NST.&#xD;
&#xD;
       10. On the morning of the seventh day (one week after enrollment and receipt of first dose&#xD;
           of oral misoprostol, 39 Â½ weeks' gestational age), the patient will be admitted to the&#xD;
           labor and delivery unit to undergo inpatient cervical ripening with oral misoprostol, or&#xD;
           oxytocin induction or augmentation as appropriate.&#xD;
&#xD;
       11. All patients who are discharged home on days 1 and 4 will be instructed to observe for&#xD;
           signs of labor or ruptured membranes, and to assess fetal movement while at home. They&#xD;
           will be instructed to return to the emergency room if they experience uterine&#xD;
           contractions occur as often as every 5 minutes for 1 hour, rupture of membranes, heavy&#xD;
           vaginal bleeding or decreased fetal movement.&#xD;
&#xD;
       12. A 24-hour emergency phone number will be provided for all patients enrolled into this&#xD;
           study protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
       13. Labor management during the active phase of labor on the unit will be at discretion of&#xD;
           the managing physician.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Labor and delivery admission procedure:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Intravenous access will be obtained.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Standard laboratory studies will be drawn, including Type and screen, complete blood&#xD;
           count, capillary blood glucose.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Continuous external fetal monitoring and external tocodynamometry will be utilized.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. A cervical examination will be performed by the physician.&#xD;
&#xD;
      NOTE: These (1-4) are the standard procedures applied to patients admitted to labor and&#xD;
      delivery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Misoprostol Inpatient Administration:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Those patients who remain with an unripened cervix and with uterine contractions less than&#xD;
      12/hour after completion of days 1 and 4 of outpatient treatment will be candidates to&#xD;
      receive misoprostol as an inpatient on day 7 per the following protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The dosing schedule will be as follows: 100 micrograms of misoprostol given orally every&#xD;
           4 hours to a maximum of 6 doses. (The medication will be provided by the pharmacy).&#xD;
&#xD;
           A. The maximum cervical ripening period will be 24 hours. After 24 hours of misoprostol,&#xD;
           if the patient has not entered active labor, the induction process may be continued with&#xD;
           oxytocin as necessary.&#xD;
&#xD;
           B. Continued, regular uterine activity (3 uterine contractions in a 10 minute period)&#xD;
           will preclude repeat dosing.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. In the event of spontaneous rupture of membranes, the patient will receive no further&#xD;
           doses of misoprostol. Oxytocin may be utilized to augment labor at the discretion of&#xD;
           managing physician.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. If the patient develops a uterine contraction abnormality as defined below, either&#xD;
           terbutaline, 0.25 mg IV or SQ or MgSO4 intravenous infusion may be administered as&#xD;
           necessary. If such abnormalities are encountered during oxytocin administration, the&#xD;
           infusion will be discontinued and the same treatment may be utilized.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. The maximum time period for cervical ripening with misoprostol is 24 hours, which may be&#xD;
           followed immediately by an adequate trial of oxytocin, which usually will not exceed 24&#xD;
           hours. Thus, no inpatient cervical ripening/induction attempt will exceed 48 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Oxytocin Induction/ Augmentation (as necessary):&#xD;
&#xD;
      1) These patients will receive oxytocin infusions according to the standard labor and&#xD;
      delivery protocol at Miller and Children's Hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Outcomes:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome measure will be the time interval from start of induction to delivery.&#xD;
      Other outcome measures will be number of doses of medication required, oxytocin requirements,&#xD;
      and route of delivery. The number of patients admitted to labor and delivery in active labor&#xD;
      will also be assessed as will interval changes in Bishop's score after application of&#xD;
      medication. Also intrapartum complications including uterine hyperstimulation, fetal distress&#xD;
      and excessive bleeding at the time of delivery will be compared, as will adverse maternal and&#xD;
      neonatal outcomes, e.g., development of endometritis or admission to the NICU respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expected Outcomes:&#xD;
&#xD;
      We anticipate that approximately 20% of patients after receiving misoprostol will enter the&#xD;
      active phase of labor and require transfer to labor and delivery. We also anticipate that we&#xD;
      will find significant differences in Bishop's scores between the two groups from day 1 and 4,&#xD;
      and find significantly shorter time intervals from start of induction to delivery in those&#xD;
      patients who receive the active agent.&#xD;
