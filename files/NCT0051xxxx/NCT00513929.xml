      The propose of this study is to evaluate if zinc given as an adjunct to standard treatment of&#xD;
      severe pneumonia in young children shortens the duration and reduces treatment failure, and&#xD;
      if these effects are pathogen-dependant.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Community-acquired pneumonia is a common and potentially serious infection that affects&#xD;
      children worldwide. The annual incidence of pneumonia in children younger than five years of&#xD;
      age is 34 to 40 cases per 1000 in Europe and North America, higher than at any other time of&#xD;
      life [1]. In developing countries, pneumonia is not only more common than it is in the&#xD;
      developed world (5 to 10% of all children &lt; 5 years old), but also is more severe and is the&#xD;
      largest cause of death in children [1, 2]. About 20% of deaths in children younger than five&#xD;
      years of age are attributable to pneumonia (1.9 million deaths per year) [3]. More than 90%&#xD;
      of these deaths are in resource-poor countries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Zinc deficiency is widespread in developing countries and is recognized to impair growth and&#xD;
      immune function [4]. Andean areas are included in the regions with the highest risk of zinc&#xD;
      deficiency worldwide [5]. In Ecuador, 33% of children suffer from zinc deficiency. However,&#xD;
      on the coast of Ecuador, where Guayaquil is located, the prevalence of zinc deficiency is 37%&#xD;
      based on plasma zinc concentration below 70 micrograms/dl [6]. Stunting, which may result&#xD;
      from chronic zinc undernutrition is present in 21.9% of children in Guayaquil [7]. In&#xD;
      addition, in a previous study, we reported low dietary zinc intake in children from 12 to 59&#xD;
      months [8]. In urban areas of Ecuador, breast-feeding is not widely practiced, which could&#xD;
      put very young children at risk of zinc deficiency [9]. Zinc is considered the most abundant&#xD;
      intracellular micronutrient that participates in a wide range of cellular processes and plays&#xD;
      a central role in the immune response to pathogens [10]. We previously demonstrated that zinc&#xD;
      supplementation in Ecuadorian children caused an increased response to delayed type&#xD;
      hypersensitivity tests to multiple pathogen-derived antigens [8].&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is no data available to determine whether the etiologies of pneumonia are dependent on&#xD;
      a child´s zinc status. In general, bronchiolitis and upper respiratory tract infections are&#xD;
      likely to be viral, whereas most cases of severe pneumonia and pneumonia-related deaths are&#xD;
      more likely to be bacterial [1]. Recently, one in vitro study found that zinc mediates&#xD;
      antiviral activity on respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), an etiological agent of pneumonia in&#xD;
      children, by altering the ability of the cell to support RSV replication [11]. If zinc status&#xD;
      has an influence on the etiology of pneumonia, this suggests that zinc deficiency might be&#xD;
      associated with a &quot;selective acquired immunodeficiency&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Meta-analyses have shown that zinc supplementation is useful for diarrhea and pneumonia&#xD;
      prevention in developing countries [12, 13]. It has been extensively shown that zinc is an&#xD;
      important adjunct to diarrhea treatment [13]. With regard to pneumonia, only three recent&#xD;
      studies have reported the use of zinc as an adjunct to antimicrobial treatment for pneumonia&#xD;
      in children. A clinical study performed in Kolkata, India, in children with acute lower&#xD;
      respiratory infection who were given zinc supplements, demonstrated a significant reduction&#xD;
      in the duration of fever and very ill status only in boys, but not in girls [14]. The&#xD;
      weaknesses of this trial included the small sample size and the fact that the observed&#xD;
      beneficial effect was based on a subgroup analysis. Another study performed in Vellore,&#xD;
      India, in a larger group of children younger than 2 years of age, demonstrated that zinc, as&#xD;
      an adjunct to antimicrobial treatment, did not have an overall effect on the duration of&#xD;
      hospitalization or clinical signs associated with pneumonia [15]. In addition, Bose et al&#xD;
      reported that the use of zinc was associated with an increased duration of clinical signs of&#xD;
      pneumonia. These different findings could be explained by the dissimilarities between both&#xD;
      geographical locations and mean basal plasma zinc concentrations in these studies (Kolkata:&#xD;
      63 µg/dl vs. Vellore: 72 µg/dl). Nevertheless, a clinical trial performed in Bangladesh&#xD;
      reported that the use of zinc as an adjunct to the treatment of severe pneumonia in children&#xD;
      reduced the duration of clinical manifestations of the disease including chest indrawing,&#xD;
      tachypnea, hypoxia, and length of hospitalization [16]. This study had a sample size similar&#xD;
      to the trial in Vellore [15] and thus had adequate power. In summary, there are conflicting&#xD;
      results on the effect of zinc given during a severe pneumonia episode in young children.&#xD;
      Pneumonia etiology is one factor that has been extensively discussed as a possible mechanism&#xD;
      to explain the controversial findings of these studies. Bose et al. suggested that the&#xD;
      increased duration of pneumonia signs during zinc supplementation might be due to different&#xD;
      etiologies of pneumonia [15]. Brooks et al. speculated that the observed reductions in&#xD;
      pneumonia duration might be explained by zinc's role in the acute phase response to pathogens&#xD;
      [16]. However, at present there is no evidence showing that zinc supplementation has an&#xD;
      etiology-dependent effect on the clinical evolution of pneumonia. In a recent editorial,&#xD;
      Hambidge also suggested that the controversial findings from these three studies could be due&#xD;
      to the basal zinc status of the intervention groups, associated pneumonia pathogens, and age&#xD;
      of the enrolled children [17].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Consequently, to clarify the role of zinc in relation to pneumonia, our study will determine&#xD;
      whether or not a low baseline zinc status is associated with the etiology of pneumonia. This&#xD;
      potential finding may strengthen the scientific evidence that supports mass population zinc&#xD;
      supplementation. Furthermore, this study will also establish if zinc used as treatment&#xD;
      adjunct during a severe pneumonia episode results in more rapid clinical recovery from&#xD;
      pneumonia. Moreover, our study intends to evaluate the effect of zinc, used as an adjunct to&#xD;
      the treatment of pneumonia, on the clinical evolution in correlation with the etiology of&#xD;
      pneumonia in Ecuadorian children when compared to placebo.&#xD;
