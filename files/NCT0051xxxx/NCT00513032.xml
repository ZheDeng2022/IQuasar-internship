    <textblock>
      We hypothesized that pre-treatment with methylene blue could potentiate the effects of&#xD;
      general anaesthetic agents in patients undergoing parathyroidectomy&#xD;
    </textblock>

      Sample and study design The local ethics committee granted approval for this study and&#xD;
      informed written consent will be obtained from all participants. We will study ASA grade I or&#xD;
      II patients, aged between 45 and 73 years who were free from cardiovascular and pulmonary&#xD;
      diseases. Patients with psychiatric disorders or drug abuse as well as those weighing 20%&#xD;
      more or less than their ideal body weight will all be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The interventional group will consist of 11 patients scheduled for elective parathyroidectomy&#xD;
      who will receive MB infusion (5mg.kg-1 in 250 ml 5% glucose-saline) approximately 60 min&#xD;
      before anaesthesia induction. A further 11 patients scheduled for unilateral thyroid&#xD;
      lobectomy without MB pre-treatment will be recruited as controls. They will present with&#xD;
      normal thyroid tests and will carefully be selected in an attempt to match the intervention&#xD;
      group on the basis of age, weight and sex. Both types of surgical procedures will be&#xD;
      performed by the same surgical team.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anaesthesia and surgery All patients will be premedicated with oral midazolam 7.5 mg and they&#xD;
      will receive a loading dose of lactate-ringer solution (5 ml.kg-1) intravenously after&#xD;
      arrival in the operating theatre. The standard anaesthetic monitoring will comprise&#xD;
      non-invasive blood pressure, ECG, pulsed oxygen saturation and end-tidal carbon dioxide.&#xD;
      Processed EEG parameters will be acquired with a BIS monitor, using surface electrodes, with&#xD;
      impedance maintained at less than 5kΩ to ensure adequate signal quality. Raw EEG data from&#xD;
      two channels (F7-CZ and F8-CZ) will be processed by company proprietary software and the BIS&#xD;
      values (calculated for each 4-sec epoch) will be continuously displayed along with the trend&#xD;
      line.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Propofol will be infused using a commercially available TCI system loaded with Schneider's&#xD;
      3-compartment pharmacokinetic model wherein the individual patient's age, height and weight&#xD;
      will be programmed. The target effect-site concentration of propofol will be computed to&#xD;
      yield a time to peak effect of 1.6 min, which has been confirmed clinically.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During anaesthesia induction, the patients will breath an air-oxygen mixture through a face&#xD;
      mask. The target effect-site concentration of propofol will first be set at 0.5 ng.ml-1 and&#xD;
      it will be increased by 0.2 ng.ml-1 every 2 min until the clinical endpoint will be achieved&#xD;
      (loss of consciousness and unresponsiveness). Then, ventilation will be assisted manually and&#xD;
      the trachea will be intubated after the intravenous administration of fentanyl (100 mcg) and&#xD;
      rocuronium (0.7 mg.kg-1).&#xD;
&#xD;
      During anaesthesia maintenance, the effect-site concentration of propofol will be targeted to&#xD;
      achieve BIS values between 30 and 60. Additional fentanyl, rocuronium or vasopressor agents&#xD;
      (ephedrine) will be given at the discretion of the attending anaesthetist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measurements When each patient will be comfortable on the operating table, baseline&#xD;
      measurements of BIS, mean arterial pressure (MAP), heart rate (HR) and pulsed oxygen&#xD;
      saturation (SpO2) will be taken.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During propofol induction, BIS values, MAP, HR and SpO2 will be recorded every 1-min and the&#xD;
      Observer's Assessment of Alertness/Sedation (OAAS) rating scale will be recorded after each&#xD;
      equilibration period (score 5=awake and responds readily to name spoken in normal tone; 4=&#xD;
      lethargic response to name in normal tone; 3=response only after name is called loudly and/or&#xD;
      repeatedly; 2= response only after name is called loudly and after mild shaking; 1= dose not&#xD;
      respond when name is called and after mild shaking).&#xD;
&#xD;
      During surgery and anaesthesia maintenance, BIS values and the effect-site concentration of&#xD;
      propofol will be recorded each 5-min.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Other recorded data will include the doses of propofol required for anaesthesia induction and&#xD;
      maintenance, the total amount of vasopressor and the time until anaesthesia emergence and&#xD;
      readiness for tracheal extubation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistics Assuming that MB pre-treatment would reduce the requirement of propofol by 25%,&#xD;
      power analysis with alpha = 0.05, beta = 0.8, shows that we would need to study at least 10&#xD;
      patients in each group. The computer program SAS 8.0 for Windows will be used for all data&#xD;
      analyses. Parametric data will be analysed by two-way ANOVA. Unpaired Student t-tests,&#xD;
      Chi-squared tests and Fisher's exact probability tests will be used as appropriate for&#xD;
      comparison between groups. All values are expressed as mean (M), standard deviation (SD) and&#xD;
      statistical significance will be accepted at p &lt; 0.05.&#xD;
