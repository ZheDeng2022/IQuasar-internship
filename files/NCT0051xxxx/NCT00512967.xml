  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are suggested to play a pivotal role in ILD. Little is known,&#xD;
      however, about the endogenous antioxidant levels in ILD that can offer protection against&#xD;
      ROS. It is expected that the high amount of ROS present in ILD will reduce the antioxidant&#xD;
      levels. Therefore, antioxidant therapy to strengthen this reduced antioxidant defense might&#xD;
      be efficacious in ILD treatment. Since ROS are capable of initiating and mediating&#xD;
      inflammation, antioxidant therapy might also mitigate elevated inflammation. A candidate for&#xD;
      antioxidant therapy is the flavonoid quercetin that is known for its anti-oxidative and&#xD;
      anti-inflammatory capacities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the present study is to determine the antioxidant and inflammatory status in ILD,&#xD;
      i.e. sarcoidosis and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). Furthermore, to evaluate the&#xD;
      possible anti-inflammatory effects of antioxidants, the effect of quercetin will be examined&#xD;
      on the ex vivo LPS-induced cytokine production in ILD&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Interstitial lung diseases (ILD) include various chronic lung disorders such as sarcoidosis&#xD;
      and idiopathic lung fibrosis (IPF). In the Netherlands the incidence of sarcoidosis is&#xD;
      approximately 20-25 per 100.000 inhabitants whereas that of IPF is approximately 1000-1500&#xD;
      new cases each year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In short, three different stages in the development of ILD can be discerned. Firstly, the&#xD;
      lung tissue is damaged. In sarcoidosis this damage is thought to be antigen-driven,&#xD;
      multisystemically and leading to the formation of granuloma. Moreover, it is suggested that&#xD;
      genetic factors play an important role in the genesis of sarcoidosis. In IPF the exact&#xD;
      etiology of this damage is unknown, but it has been speculated to be inflicted by an&#xD;
      unidentified stimulus that produces repeated episodes of acute lung injury Secondly, the&#xD;
      walls of the air sacs in the lung become inflamed as a reaction to the caused damage. This&#xD;
      results in the activation of inflammatory cells like macrophages that cause the expression of&#xD;
      pro-inflammatory cytokines, especially interleukin-10 and tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha,&#xD;
      in the lungs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Finally, scarring (or fibrosis) begins in the interstitium (or tissue between the air sacs)&#xD;
      and the lung becomes stiff, causing an irreversible loss of the tissue's ability to transfer&#xD;
      oxygen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is well-known that inflammation plays a key-role in the occurrence and progression of ILD,&#xD;
      although the long-lasting hypothesis that inflammation alone leads to fibrosis is being&#xD;
      questioned at the moment. Conventional treatment of ILD comprises nonspecific&#xD;
      anti-inflammatory agents such as glucocorticoids (prednisone) and other immune-suppressing&#xD;
      medication such as cyclophosphamide, methotrexate and gamma-interferon. However, all these&#xD;
      therapies fail to be completely efficacious, suggesting that inflammation alone is indeed not&#xD;
      solely responsible for the occurrence and progression of ILD. Paradoxically, anti-TNF-Î±&#xD;
      agents such as infliximab and thalidomide have recently shown some beneficial effects in&#xD;
      sarcoidosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A pivotal role for reactive oxygen species (ROS) in all three stages has also been proposed.&#xD;
      Various biomarkers of oxidative stress, i.e. exhaled ethane and both 8-isoprostane and&#xD;
      oxidized proteins in the bronchoalveolar fluid, are elevated in ILD patients of different&#xD;
      clinical stages. However, only little is known about the effect of this elevated oxidative&#xD;
      stress on the endogenous antioxidant levels present in ILD. Interestingly, clinical&#xD;
      administration of an antioxidant, i.e. N-acetylcysteine (NAC), to IPF patients has recently&#xD;
      demonstrated that this slows the deterioration of vital capacity and carbon monoxide&#xD;
      diffusing capacity (DLCO) at 12 months. This supports the hypothesis that oxidative stress is&#xD;
      involved in ILD and proofs the principle of antioxidant treatment in ILD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is well-known that oxidative stress and inflammation are intertwined and that the&#xD;
      pro-inflammatory cytokine TNF-alpha is capable of stimulating oxidative stress in various&#xD;
      cells and tissues. As a result, the preliminary beneficial effects of anti-TNF-alpha agents&#xD;
      combined with the preliminary beneficial effects of antioxidants in ILD may indicate that a&#xD;
      new strategy of treatment of ILD should ideally combine the reduction of both the oxidative&#xD;
      stress and the inflammation occurring in these diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently, much attention has been given to the potential health-beneficial properties of&#xD;
      flavonoids, natural occurring polyphenolic compounds, and to quercetin, the most commonly&#xD;
      occurring flavonoid, in particular. Quercetin is known to be a powerful antioxidant and to&#xD;
      possess some anti-inflammatory effects. It is therefore tempting to speculate that quercetin&#xD;
      could exert positive effects in ILD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since the anti-oxidative and inflammatory changes in ILD are still not exactly known, the aim&#xD;
      of the present study is to determine both the anti-oxidant and the inflammatory status in&#xD;
      ILD, i.e. sarcoidosis and fibrosis. Furthermore, the possible anti-inflammatory effect of&#xD;
      antioxidants on LPS-induced cytokine production, exemplified with the flavonoid quercetin,&#xD;
      will be examined.&#xD;
