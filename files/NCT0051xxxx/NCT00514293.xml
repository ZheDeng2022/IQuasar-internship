      RATIONALE: Bexarotene and tretinoin may cause tumor cells to look more like normal cells, and&#xD;
      to grow and spread more slowly. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as cisplatin, carboplatin,&#xD;
      docetaxel, and capecitabine, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either&#xD;
      by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Giving bexarotene and tretinoin&#xD;
      together with combination chemotherapy may kill more tumor cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying the side effects and how well giving bexarotene&#xD;
      together with tretinoin and combination chemotherapy works in treating patients with stage&#xD;
      III or stage IV non-small cell lung cancer.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluate the efficacy of bexarotene at a dose of 375 mg daily for 4 days with tretinoin&#xD;
           also for the same 3 days with chemotherapy in patients with advanced non-small cell lung&#xD;
           cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluate the safety and tolerability of this drug combination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: Patients will receive oral bexarotene 375 mg once daily and oral tretinoin 50 mg&#xD;
      twice daily on days 1-3. Patients also receive combination chemotherapy comprising cisplatin&#xD;
      or carboplatin with docetaxel and capecitabine orally or intravenously on days 1-3. Treatment&#xD;
      repeats every 14 days for up to 12 courses in the absence of disease progression or&#xD;
      unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients will be followed every 4 weeks.&#xD;
