    <textblock>
      The relationship between Osteopathic Manipulative Therapy (OMT) and the autonomic nervous&#xD;
      system is poorly understood. This study quantifies that relationship and demonstrates a cause&#xD;
      and effect. It is hypothesized that cervical myofascial release increases vagal tone.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      For most osteopathic physicians the validation of osteopathic manipulative treatment (OMT)&#xD;
      has been largely observational and based on patient outcomes such as improvement in pain&#xD;
      scales, range of motion, and other empiric measures.1,2 However, the osteopathic profession&#xD;
      has long recognized a relationship between the autonomic nervous system and the function of&#xD;
      the body in health and disease, although there is relatively little quantitative data&#xD;
      evaluating the relationship between manipulation and the autonomic nervous system.3,4&#xD;
&#xD;
      A theoretical basis for the action of OMT and its effect in the body has been advanced based&#xD;
      on autonomic activation causing concomitant vasodilatation, smooth muscle relaxation, and&#xD;
      increased blood flow, resulting in improved range of motion, decrease in pain perception, or&#xD;
      change in tissue. Until recently this association remained largely a theoretical&#xD;
      consideration due to the inability to accurately measure autonomic activity directly. Over&#xD;
      the past two decades indirect methods have been developed and refined to provide noninvasive&#xD;
      markers of autonomic balance,5,6 with heart rate variability (HRV) being commonly used. HRV&#xD;
      is based on the inherent variation of the R-to-R intervals of a standard electrocardiogram&#xD;
      (ECG), with these variations largely due to changes in autonomic balance at the sinus&#xD;
      node.6-8&#xD;
&#xD;
      Spectral analysis of heart rate variability has been used to study autonomic balance in&#xD;
      humans, and it is generally accepted that the high frequency (HF) component (0.15-0.4 Hz) can&#xD;
      be used as a marker for vagal modulation of heart rate. Although it is tempting to use the&#xD;
      low frequency (LF) component (0.04-0.15 Hz) as a marker for sympathetic activity, its&#xD;
      specificity is less clear. Pagani and colleagues9,10 have hypothesized that when the LF&#xD;
      component is expressed in normalized units (LFnu) it becomes a better marker of sympathetic&#xD;
      modulation of heart rate. For most studies using spectral analysis, the LF/HF ratio is used&#xD;
      and considered by many to be a good index of sympathovagal balance.6,7,9,10&#xD;
&#xD;
      The confidence given to the LF/HF ratio accurately reflecting autonomic balance is&#xD;
      significantly influenced by experimental design. A tilt protocol involving postural change&#xD;
      from horizontal to upright can be used to calibrate the change in the LF/HF ratio which&#xD;
      occurs between the two positions and thus set a physiological range for sympathetic and vagal&#xD;
      modulation of heart rate. An experimental procedure then can be implemented where comparisons&#xD;
      are made of the changes in the LF/HF ratios that occur when the body is shifted from the&#xD;
      horizontal to the upright position under conditions with application of an intervention&#xD;
      versus without the intervention. In this manner, an experimentally mediated change in LF/HF&#xD;
      ratio (i.e., with intervention) can be calibrated against a physiologically relevant change&#xD;
      in ratio (i.e., without intervention).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This approach was used by these investigators in a pilot study (n=9 healthy, adult&#xD;
      volunteers, 3 females and 6 males) which showed that the LF/HF ratio changed from a mean of&#xD;
      1.75+1.40 (mean+SD) in the horizontal position to a mean of 6.00+1.20 in the 50-degree&#xD;
      head-up position. This change reflects an increase in sympathetic tone. Mean heart rate in&#xD;
      these subjects increased from 61+7 bpm to 78+2 bpm in the head-up position. The subjects then&#xD;
      were treated in the 50-degree head-up position with an OMT procedure, cervical myofascial&#xD;
      release, which is thought to increase vagal tone. After the procedure was applied, the LF/HF&#xD;
      ratio decreased back down to 1.75+1.58, even though the subjects were still in the head-up&#xD;
      position. These data support the initial hypothesis that specific OMT procedures can modulate&#xD;
      vagal tone, and also provide information relating to the significance of the LF/HF change.&#xD;
      That is, the application of OMT reversed the increase in the ratio that occurs in the&#xD;
      50-degree head-up position.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We conducted a continuation project to further examine the association between OMT and&#xD;
      autonomic nervous system activity as demonstrated by HRV, studying the hypothesis that&#xD;
      cervical myofascial release increased vagal tone. In a within subjects (repeated measures)&#xD;
      design, we examined the effect of OMT on HRV in comparison with sham treatment (touch only)&#xD;
      and control (no touch) conditions.&#xD;
