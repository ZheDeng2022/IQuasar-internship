      Tolerated Dose (MTD) on both Once Daily (QD) and Twice Daily (BID) schedules.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>

      Multicenter, open-label, phase 1, cohort dose escalation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will open with the QD schedule, with initiation of the BID schedule occurring after&#xD;
      observation of clinically significant related toxicity ≥ grade 2 in the QD schedule.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dosing will be initiated on Day 1 with daily dosing (either QD or BID) continuing for 21&#xD;
      days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once the recommended phase 2 dose has been determined for the BID schedule, 2 expansion&#xD;
      cohorts will be opened: 1) Biomarker Expansion Cohort in patients with locally advanced or&#xD;
      metastatic colorectal cancer and 2) Diabetic Expansion Cohort in patients with advanced solid&#xD;
      tumors who have active Type 2 diabetes mellitus not requiring insulin or insulinotropic&#xD;
      therapy.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Histologically or cytologically documented malignancy that is now advanced and/or&#xD;
             metastatic and refractory to established forms of therapy or for which no effective&#xD;
             therapy exists. Patients in the Biomarker Expansion Cohort must have histologically&#xD;
             documented colorectal cancer that is locally advanced or metastatic and refractory to&#xD;
             established forms of therapy. These patients must have archival tissue available and a&#xD;
             lesion accessible for biopsy&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance Status (PS) 0-2, life expectancy&#xD;
             ≥ 12 weeks&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Prior radiation therapy is permitted provided that patients have recovered from the&#xD;
             toxic effects. A minimum of 21 days must have elapsed unless the radiotherapy was&#xD;
             palliative and nonmyelosuppressive&#xD;
