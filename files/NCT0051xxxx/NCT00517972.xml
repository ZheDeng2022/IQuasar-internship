      Recently, antidepressants and other similar acting agents have been explored as a class of&#xD;
      medications to treat major depressive disorder (MDD) in the context of perimenopause, as well&#xD;
      as the somatic symptoms of perimenopause (such as hot flashes). Omega-3 fatty acids, which&#xD;
      include eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), are nutritional compounds&#xD;
      with widely established health benefits and which occur naturally in fish and marine sources.&#xD;
      Results of previous mood disorder studies have indicated that omega-3 fatty acids may be of&#xD;
      help in the treatment of depression. Therefore, the current study is designed to examine the&#xD;
      effectiveness and tolerability of the study drug, Omacor, (omega-3 fatty acid ethyl esters),&#xD;
      in the treatment of major depressive disorder in perimenopausal women.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Over twenty percent of women will experience a major depressive episode in their lifetimes, a&#xD;
      prevalence that reflects a greater risk than is found among men. Perimenopause is commonly&#xD;
      defined as a time of hormonal fluctuation that typically occurs in women 40-55 years of age&#xD;
      with changes in menstrual patterns. It has been demonstrated that women may be at a&#xD;
      particularly high risk for depressive symptoms during perimenopause. Hormone replacement&#xD;
      therapy, particularly estrogen, may help with mood symptoms in the perimenopause. However,&#xD;
      hormone replacement therapy (HRT) has become increasingly controversial in light of the&#xD;
      findings of the Women's Health Initiative study. In that study, HRT was associated with an&#xD;
      increased risk of some serious health problems without many of the benefits which had been&#xD;
      previously attributed to HRT. Since the report of these results, HRT use has declined and&#xD;
      other agents such as antidepressants have been used as an alternative treatment for&#xD;
      depression in perimenopausal women.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Optimal treatments for depression must be safe and effective, with ideal treatments also&#xD;
      providing other health benefits as well. Omega-3 fatty acids are nutritional compounds with&#xD;
      widely established health benefits. Eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid&#xD;
      (DHA) are omega-3 fatty acids found in fish and marine sources. Mood disorder studies have&#xD;
      supported a role for omega-3 fatty acids in the treatment of depression. In a study from&#xD;
      1998, it was demonstrated in a cross-national study that the risk of major depression is&#xD;
      inversely associated with per capita fish consumption. Several other studies have&#xD;
      demonstrated that in depressed subjects, there is a lower total omega-3 fatty acid content in&#xD;
      the membranes of red blood cells and plasma (liquid part of the blood) when compared to&#xD;
      control subjects. Treatment data from studies of major depressive disorder also support a&#xD;
      role for omega-3 fatty acids, especially when omega-3 fatty acids are used as an adjunctive&#xD;
      treatment, i.e., fatty acids are administered along with another therapeutic compound during&#xD;
      treatment of major depressive disorder.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It has also been demonstrated that the use of antidepressants such as fluoxetine, paroxetine,&#xD;
      and venlafaxine for treatment of hot flashes and citalopram for the treatment of hot flashes&#xD;
      and mood in perimenopausal women are more effective than placebo. However, antidepressant&#xD;
      medications are associated with significant side effects and as of late, have come under&#xD;
      increased scrutiny by the U.S. FDA, the psychiatric, and general medical community due to the&#xD;
      ongoing controversy regarding a possible increased risk of suicidality after the initiation&#xD;
      of antidepressant treatment. While there is not complete agreement on the mechanism of action&#xD;
      for omega-3 fatty acids, like antidepressants, overall data suggests that omega-3 fatty acids&#xD;
      may be beneficial for treatment of perimenopausal depression. However, unlike&#xD;
      antidepressants, omega-3 fatty acids are naturally occurring substances, which may appeal to&#xD;
      many individuals suffering from perimenopausal depression. Omega-3 fatty acids have known&#xD;
      benefits for cardiovascular health. Therefore, the current study is designed to examine the&#xD;
      effectiveness and tolerability of the study drug, Omacor, (omega-3 fatty acid ethyl esters),&#xD;
      in the treatment of major depression in perimenopausal women.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects that take part in this voluntary study will undergo 6 clinic visits during the&#xD;
      8-week study period. The first visit may last up to 3 hours, with all other clinic visits&#xD;
      lasting approximately 45 minutes. Once the consent form has been read and signed, subjects&#xD;
      will be enrolled in the study. At the first visit, medical and psychiatric histories will be&#xD;
      reviewed. All participants will undergo the standardized protocol for establishing&#xD;
      depression, the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV (SCID), in addition to being rated&#xD;
      by symptom rating scales that include the Clinical Global Impression (CGI) and the Hamilton&#xD;
      Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D (17-item). All participants will also undergo an entry&#xD;
      interview that will include a psychiatric and substance use history (including data regarding&#xD;
      use of alcohol, tobacco, and illicit substances). During the initial exam, vital signs&#xD;
      (height, weight and blood pressure) will also be recorded for all participants. In addition,&#xD;
      all subjects that are enrolled must have had a gynecologic exam within the past year, or if&#xD;
      not, will be given a referral for such an exam. Blood (approximately 3 teaspoons) will be&#xD;
      drawn for routine laboratory testing (thyroid function tests (TFTs) and complete blood count&#xD;
      (CBC)) and a lipid profile. Blood will also be drawn (approximately 3 teaspoons) at the last&#xD;
      visit for the purpose of repeating the lipid profile. Subjects will also complete the Greene&#xD;
      Climacteric Scale (GCS), which is used to quantify the severity of perimenopausal somatic&#xD;
      symptoms, including hot flashes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As this study will be examining omega-3 fatty acids, subjects will not be eligible to&#xD;
      participate in the study if they are taking omega-3 fatty acid supplements. In addition, once&#xD;
      enrolled in the study, all participants will be asked to avoid taking additional omega-3&#xD;
      fatty acids or enhanced food products and will need to avoid increasing or decreasing the&#xD;
      amount of fish that they normally eat during the entire time of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once all interviews and medical screens are finished, all participants will receive the study&#xD;
      medication (Omacor). The study drug will be supplied in 1 gram capsules and participants will&#xD;
      need to take two capsules at the same time every day. Thus, all subjects will be taking a&#xD;
      total of 2 grams of Omacor per day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Questions about mood and perimenopausal symptoms will be asked at each visit. At each of&#xD;
      these visits, the primary efficacy measures (CGI, HAM-D, and GCS) will be administered. The&#xD;
      GCS will be completed at each visit to quantify the somatic symptoms of perimenopause.&#xD;
      Subjects will also be asked the about number of missed doses each week.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Telephone contact with investigators is permissible and will be available 24 hours/day for&#xD;
      emergencies. All contacts will be documented in the participant's records.&#xD;
