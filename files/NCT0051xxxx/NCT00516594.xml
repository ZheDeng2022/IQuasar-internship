  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Our antibiotic studies indicated that cholesterol lowering was seen when fecal&#xD;
      bifidobacterial counts were increased. Due to the dangers associated with prolonged&#xD;
      antibiotic use we have been funded by the Heart and Stroke Foundation to see if gut bacteria&#xD;
      can be modified by non-antibiotic means. Inulin a dietary fiber found in artichokes, chicory,&#xD;
      leaks, onion, etc., (which also produces flatulence) has been shown to increase&#xD;
      bifidobacteria and also appears to lower serum cholesterol. We will therefore test the fiber&#xD;
      to determine its effectiveness in lowering serum cholesterol and whether it can be used to&#xD;
      maximize the cholesterol-lowering effects of soy protein foods and viscous fiber foods (e.g.&#xD;
      oats and psyllium).&#xD;

      Design: Studies will be three phase randomized crossover design with all subjects undergoing&#xD;
      all three phases. Each phase will be one month in duration with at least 2-4 weeks washout&#xD;
      between phases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      General Protocol: Both dietary studies (Study 1 fiber plus polyfructans; and Study 2 soy plus&#xD;
      polyfructans) will follow the same general protocol. Supplements and measurements will differ&#xD;
      between studies. Diets will be self-selected low-fat diets throughout (&lt;7% of total energy as&#xD;
      saturated fat and, &lt;200 mg/d dietary cholesterol). Supplements will be provided at weekly&#xD;
      intervals. At the start and at two weekly intervals during the study body weight, blood&#xD;
      pressure and fasting bloods will be taken together with 24h urine and 4-day fecal collections&#xD;
      and samples for fecal microbiology to be obtained during week 4. Treatments: Both studies&#xD;
      will involve a control diet which will be an NCEP step 2 diet (low in saturated fat and&#xD;
      dietary cholesterol) with 10-20 g inulin. Study 1 subjects will take 10-15 g viscous fiber&#xD;
      foods with or without the fructan. Study 2 subjects will take 30-40 g soy protein foods with&#xD;
      or without the fructan (please see Table 1). The supplements will be provided as foods: oat&#xD;
      bran bread to be taken with meals and as snacks during Study 1 and soy protein to be taken in&#xD;
      soy beverage, soy hot dogs, burgers, tofu, etc., during Study 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Details: Subjects will come after a 12h overnight fast to the Risk Factor Modification&#xD;
      Centre at St. Michael's Hospital immediately prior to commencement of each treatment phase&#xD;
      and at weekly intervals during the course of each study period. Prior to the start of the&#xD;
      study, subjects will be instructed on details of the study diet protocol. They will also be&#xD;
      asked to maintain a constant level of physical activity throughout the course of the study.&#xD;
      At all visits, body weight (in kg) will be obtained in indoor clothing, without shoes, and&#xD;
      blood pressure will be taken twice in the dominant arm after subjects have been seated for at&#xD;
      least 20 minutes. Height (in cm) will be recorded at the first visit. Throughout the study&#xD;
      period, subjects will maintain their usual diet, which should be an NCEP step 2 diet (low&#xD;
      saturated fat). Subjects will provide a fasting blood sample at week 0 and at weekly periods&#xD;
      throughout the study. At weeks 0, and 4 seven-day food records will be collected. Subjects&#xD;
      will also be weighed and seated blood pressure will be taken. Breath samples, 24h urine and&#xD;
      4-day fecal collections will be made at the beginning of the study and at the end of each&#xD;
      study phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Diets: Initial dietary records prior to the start of the study together with instruction from&#xD;
      the dietitian will ensure all subjects are on low fat (&lt;7% of energy from saturated fat), low&#xD;
      cholesterol diets (&lt;200 mg/d), which they will maintain throughout the study. During the&#xD;
      study subjects will collect their supplements at weekly intervals and return uneaten&#xD;
      supplements. Subjects will be provided with self-tarring scales and diet history forms on&#xD;
      which to record all food eaten together with the weights of all food items consumed during&#xD;
      each study phase. These will be checked by the dietitian at weekly intervals to ensure&#xD;
      compliance with the diet plan and to ensure there are no changes in body weight. Photocopies&#xD;
      of the first week's diet record will be provided to each subject at the start of each phase&#xD;
      to act as a dietary template and ensure consistency between studies. Compliance: This will be&#xD;
      assessed by the return of uneaten supplements which will be weighed at the end of each phase&#xD;
      and from the completed weekly check lists of supplements eaten and seven day diet records.&#xD;
