    <criteria>

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Subjects who have completed all scheduled clinical study visits in the previous&#xD;
             protocol 1042-0600 and have been deemed eligible (no major adverse events thought to&#xD;
             be drug related) by the Investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Diagnosis of epilepsy with CPS with or without secondarily generalized seizures&#xD;
             according to the International League Against Epilepsy [ILAE] Classification of&#xD;
             Epileptic Seizures (1981). Diagnosis should have been established by clinical history&#xD;
             and computerized tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain to&#xD;
             rule out progressive structural lesions and electroencephalogram (EEG) or video EEG&#xD;
             with results consistent with partial-onset epilepsy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Male or female, 18 to 69 years of age (inclusive). [Note: Subjects who are &gt; 69 years&#xD;
             of age but are of good health condition may be allowed to enter the study after&#xD;
             discussion with and approval by the Medical Monitor.]&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. A 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) without clinically significant abnormalities.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Be properly informed of the nature and risks of the study and give informed consent in&#xD;
             writing, prior to entering the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Able to participate for the full term of study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Able to keep a seizure diary throughout the course of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Sexually active women of childbearing potential must be using a medically acceptable&#xD;
             method of birth control and have a negative qualitative serum beta-human chorionic&#xD;
             growth hormone (beta HCG) pregnancy test result from a blood sample collected at the&#xD;
             initial screening visit. A woman of childbearing potential is defined as a female who&#xD;
             is biologically capable of becoming pregnant. A medically acceptable method of birth&#xD;
             control includes intrauterine devices in place for at least 3 months, surgical&#xD;
             sterilization, or adequate barrier methods (e.g., diaphragm and foam). An oral&#xD;
             contraceptive alone is not considered adequate for the purpose of this study. Use of&#xD;
             oral contraceptives in combination with another method (e.g., a spermicidal cream) is&#xD;
             acceptable. In subjects who are not sexually active, abstinence is an acceptable form&#xD;
             of birth control and qualitative serum βHCG pregnancy tests must be tested per&#xD;
             protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Subjects with a history of depression must be stable and may be taking one&#xD;
             antidepressant medication&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Presence of non-motor simple partial seizures only.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. History of pseudoseizures in the last 5 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. History of a primary generalized seizure in the last 5 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Past use of vigabatrin without stable visual fields tested twice over the 12 months&#xD;
             after the last dose of vigabatrin (Concomitant use of vigabatrin is not allowed).&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Seizures secondary to illicit drug or alcohol use, infection, neoplasm, demyelinating&#xD;
             disease, degenerative neurological disease, or CNS disease deemed progressive,&#xD;
             metabolic illness, or progressive degenerative disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Status epilepticus within the last year prior to randomization in1042-0600 study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Clinically unstable psychiatric disorder within the last 2 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Suicide attempt within the last 5 years or current significant suicidal ideation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. History of psychosis within the last 5 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Current use of neuroleptics for psychosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. A significant medical or surgical condition at screening which might compromise the&#xD;
             hematologic, cardiovascular, pulmonary, renal, gastrointestinal, or hepatic systems or&#xD;
             other conditions that would place the subject at increased risk.&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Known sensitivity or allergy to progesterone or related steroid compounds.&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. History of drug use or alcohol abuse within the past 5 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
         14. Sexually active women of childbearing potential (WCBP) who are unwilling to use a&#xD;
             double-barrier method and establish that they are currently not pregnant by submitting&#xD;
             to a serum pregnancy test.&#xD;
&#xD;
         15. A history of chronic noncompliance with drug regimens.&#xD;
&#xD;
         16. Females who are currently breastfeeding.&#xD;
&#xD;
         17. Exposure to any other investigational drug within 30 days prior to randomization in&#xD;
             1042-0600 study.&#xD;
&#xD;
         18. Aspartate transaminase (AST) or alanine transaminase (ALT) levels &gt; 3 times the upper&#xD;
             limit of normal (ULN) at screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
         19. Subject has history of repetitive seizures within the 12-month period preceding study&#xD;
             entry where the individual seizures cannot be counted.&#xD;
