  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Despite intensive research efforts, there are still no simple and effective screening tools&#xD;
      to detect early lung cancer. The majority of newly diagnosed patients have higher stage,&#xD;
      often disseminated, non-resectable disease. A better understanding of the natural biology and&#xD;
      molecular abnormalities in early lung lesions may aid in the development of more effective&#xD;
      screening tools. This study will investigate the effectiveness of bronchoscopy by white light&#xD;
      (WL) alone and in combination with Lung Imaging Fluorescence Endoscopy (LIFE) for the&#xD;
      detection of early lung lesions in patients with a high risk for developing lung cancer. LIFE&#xD;
      is a FDA approved adjunct to WL bronchoscopy for the screening of lung cancer and this study&#xD;
      will provide a standardized setting in which a direct comparison between a combination of WL&#xD;
      and LIFE versus traditional WL bronchoscopy can be made.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, the study will set the stage for the collection of a unique set of biopsy&#xD;
      specimens that will be used to learn more about the natural biology and the molecular changes&#xD;
      in early lung lesions. We will study abnormalities in p53 by immunohistochemistry and by&#xD;
      molecular analyses. The p53 results will be compared with histological grade and with genomic&#xD;
      instability. Measures for genomic instability will be the loss of chromosomal information and&#xD;
      cellular aneuploidy. Recent advances in molecular pathology, such as the development of Laser&#xD;
      Capture Microdissection (LCM), have made the molecular profiling of these extremely small&#xD;
      lesions feasible. The information obtained by these techniques will be used for comparison&#xD;
      with clinical and exposure information. Future plans include the culturing of bronchial&#xD;
      epithelial cells to study genomic instability in the multistep process of cancer progression.&#xD;
      It is our hope that the application of these new technologies will improve the early&#xD;
      detection of human lung cancer and provide insight into the natural biology and molecular&#xD;
      changes of early lung lesions which may progress towards overt cancers.&#xD;
