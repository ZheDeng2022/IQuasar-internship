  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Crohn's disease is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the gastrointestinal tract. The origin&#xD;
      of Crohn's disease remains unknown and there is no curative therapy, either medical or&#xD;
      surgical, for this gut disorder.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is believed that an infectious agent is important in the development of Crohn's disease.&#xD;
      The similarity of Crohn's disease to the animal form of ileitis, termed Johne's disease,&#xD;
      supports the possibility that both disorders are caused by exposure to Mycobacterium avium&#xD;
      paratuberculosis or MAP. Multiple investigators have demonstrated good clinical responses of&#xD;
      patients with Crohn's disease to treatment with triple antibiotic therapy directed against&#xD;
      mycobacterial infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis of this protocol is that triple antibiotic therapy is useful as a medical&#xD;
      therapy for patients with Crohn's disease. The aim of this study is to examine the response&#xD;
      of patients with Crohn's disease who are not receiving therapy with biological agents to&#xD;
      triple antibiotic therapy.&#xD;

      Clinical remission will be determined by a decline in the Crohns disease activity index to&#xD;
      &lt;151; clinical improvement will be examined using the inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)&#xD;
      quality of life questionnaire; and endoscopic improvement will be examined using a Crohn's&#xD;
      disease endoscopic activity index. All individuals must have had colonoscopy within 3 months&#xD;
      of enrollment. An estimated 20 individuals will be enrolled in this protocol. Each patient&#xD;
      will be treated for 6 months with a combination of rifabutin, clarithromycin, and&#xD;
      clofazimine. At the end of 6 months of treatment for each patient, the Crohns disease&#xD;
      activity index will be recalculated, each patient will again complete the IBD quality of life&#xD;
      questionnaire, and each patient will undergo repeat colonoscopy.&#xD;
