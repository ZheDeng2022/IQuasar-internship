      This study will test whether a short interview session about lead and secondhand tobacco&#xD;
      smoke can help pregnant women reduce their exposure to lead and secondhand smoke. Both lead&#xD;
      and secondhand tobacco smoke can cause problems with a pregnancy. The best way to prevent&#xD;
      exposure to lead and secondhand tobacco smoke is to recognize the sources and avoid them.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Non-smoking African-American and Hispanic pregnant women between 18 and 49 years of age who&#xD;
      live in Washington, D.C. may be eligible for this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants are randomly assigned to one of two study groups. Both groups have a 30-minute&#xD;
      one-on-one session with a member of the study staff. The content of the session differs&#xD;
      between groups. In addition, all women undergo the following tests and procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Answer questions about themselves, their pregnancies, diet, home and smokers in the&#xD;
           home.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Requested to provide permission to obtain medical records of children older than 12&#xD;
           months of age who have ever been seen at Children's National Medical Center.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood draws at least four times during the study: at the time of enrollment, during the&#xD;
           second trimester of the pregnancy, during the third trimester, and at the time of&#xD;
           delivery. Up to three optional blood samples may also be requested, one during each&#xD;
           trimester of the pregnancy. Blood samples are used to measure lead, cotinine (a chemical&#xD;
           the body makes out of nicotine) and hematocrit (a test for anemia).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Collection of umbilical cord blood at the time of delivery.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Answer questions after the delivery about the patient's health, the delivery and the&#xD;
           baby.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Prenatal exposure to lead and tobacco has been shown to cause long-term adverse effects to&#xD;
      the fetus and child, including decreased birthweight and premature delivery. These effects&#xD;
      have been shown even at very low exposure levels. Since both exposures can be modified, many&#xD;
      experts recommend screening for and counseling to prevent or reduce these exposures as part&#xD;
      of routine prenatal care. The high infant mortality in the District of Columbia (DC) (10.2&#xD;
      deaths per 1,000 live births, versus 6.2 deaths per 1,000 births nationally) is incompletely&#xD;
      understood, but disparities in health and healthcare access for minority populations,&#xD;
      premature delivery, and low birthweight are likely contributors. Several studies and&#xD;
      prevention programs have addressed smoking by and secondhand tobacco smoke (SHS) exposure of&#xD;
      pregnant women living in DC in an effort to reduce the infant mortality rate, but none have&#xD;
      addressed elevated blood lead levels (BLL) or the effects of exposure to both elevated BLL&#xD;
      and SHS. Since DC children have high rates of both elevated BLL and SHS exposure, compared to&#xD;
      the US population, we hypothesize that pregnant women in DC have similar high rates of&#xD;
      elevated BLL and SHS exposure, AND that these exposures contribute to the high rates of low&#xD;
      birthweight and decreased gestational age, and therefore to the rate of infant mortality in&#xD;
      DC. The primary aim of this study is to determine the effectiveness of a screening and&#xD;
      secondary prevention intervention for elevated blood lead and SHS exposure of low income,&#xD;
      pregnant women living in Washington, DC.&#xD;
