      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To determine the safety, tolerability and maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of oral temozolomide&#xD;
      using a 7 days on and 7 days off regimen combined with intrathecal liposomal cytarabine&#xD;
      (DepoCyt) in patients with neoplastic meningitis from solid tumors and systemic lymphoma.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Liposomal cytarabine is a slow-release formulation of cytarabine or Ara-C. It is designed to&#xD;
      slowly release cytarabine to increase exposure of cancer cells to the drug in the treatment&#xD;
      of leptomeningeal disease. Temozolomide is a chemotherapy drug that is designed to attach to&#xD;
      the DNA of rapidly dividing cells (cancer cells). The cells recognize this and self-destruct.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tests called an Indium-111 or Technetium 99m-DPTA CSF flow study, where radioactive dye is&#xD;
      injected into the CSF, will be done to make sure the CSF flows freely throughout the spinal&#xD;
      canal. These are done as part of the screening evaluation. If the flow study is okay, you&#xD;
      will be eligible to take part in this study. But if there is a block of the CSF pathway, the&#xD;
      area may be treated (usually with radiation) and then you can be re-evaluated and may still&#xD;
      be enrolled in the study if a repeat flow study shows that the block has been cleared.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you have a ventriculoperitoneal (VP) or ventriculoatrial (VA) shunt in place, you will&#xD;
      have a shunt closure test in which your shunt system will be closed and you will be monitored&#xD;
      for 4 hours for the development of clinical signs of increased intracranial pressure. The&#xD;
      shunt closure test is performed to allow for a long enough time for the shunt to be closed&#xD;
      after liposomal cytarabine is injected. Researchers want to make sure that the drug will stay&#xD;
      in the CSF system long enough to perform its function, without being siphoned off through the&#xD;
      shunt.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An Ommaya Reservoir (a small round plastic pouch with a tube that goes into the brain and&#xD;
      CSF) will be placed under the scalp by a neurosurgeon before starting therapy if you do not&#xD;
      already have one in place. The reservoir will be used to deliver the liposomal cytarabine and&#xD;
      to collect samples of CSF when they are needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Liposomal cytarabine will be given through the Ommaya Reservoir once every 14 days on Day 1&#xD;
      for a total of 12 weeks (6 treatments). This is called Induction Treatment. After the first&#xD;
      12 weeks, liposomal cytarabine will be given on Day 1 every 28 days for 40 weeks (10&#xD;
      treatments). This is called Maintenance Treatment. If you are not already taking daily&#xD;
      dexamethasone, you will begin to take dexamethasone by mouth twice a day on the day before&#xD;
      the depocyt starts each course and continuing 5 days after the administration of liposomal&#xD;
      cytarabine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Temozolomide will be taken by mouth once a day for 7 days (Days 1 - 7) every 14 days starting&#xD;
      from the second treatment of liposomal cytarabine Day 14. You will take it continuously&#xD;
      throughout Induction and Maintenance treatment with liposomal cytarabine. Your doctor may&#xD;
      prescribe an anti-nausea medication to be taken 1 hour before taking temozolomide. Your&#xD;
      doctor will choose the most appropriate anti-nausea medication for you at that time. You&#xD;
      should swallow the temozolomide capsules (usually between 1 and 5) whole and quickly one&#xD;
      after the other. You should not chew the temozolomide capsules. If vomiting occurs during the&#xD;
      course of treatment, no re-dosing will be done before the next scheduled dose. You should&#xD;
      take temozolomide at bedtime and fast (not eat or drink anything except water) for at least 1&#xD;
      hour before each dose and for 1 hour after each dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Three (3) participants at a time will be enrolled in the Phase I portion of this study. The&#xD;
      first group of participants will receive a certain dose of temozolomide. If this dose is&#xD;
      tolerated, then an additional 3 will be treated at this dose. If no more than 1 participant&#xD;
      has a severe side effect, then that will be the dose for the Phase II portion of this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the Phase II portion, if a participant has shown the ability to tolerate the first&#xD;
      dose level, the next dose may be increased, which will be decided by the treating physician&#xD;
      at the next treatment timepoint.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the study, blood samples (about 1 tablespoon each) for routine tests will be repeated&#xD;
      every week during Induction and then every 2 weeks during the Maintenance period. The Gd-MRI&#xD;
      of the brain and spine will be repeated at Week 6 and 12 and then every 8 weeks. Within 72&#xD;
      hours of each liposomal cytarabine dosing, vital signs and a physical and neurological exam&#xD;
      will be done. CSF will be removed from the Ommaya Reservoir every 2 weeks and through lumbar&#xD;
      puncture every 6 weeks during Induction and from the Ommaya Reservoir every 4 weeks and&#xD;
      through lumbar puncture every 8 weeks during the Maintenance period to look for cancer cells&#xD;
      in the fluid.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment will continue unless the disease gets worse or unacceptable side effects occur.&#xD;
      Treatment will be given on an outpatient basis. At the end of the study, vital signs, a&#xD;
      complete physical and neurological exam, and routine blood tests (about 1 tablespoon) will be&#xD;
      performed. CSF samples for cytology, protein, glucose, and cell count will be taken. The&#xD;
      Gd-MRI scan will be repeated. You will be asked to complete a questionnaire about how you are&#xD;
      feeling.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of the study, you will have a physical and neurological exam and vital signs&#xD;
      and CSF samples collected every 28 days for 3 months and then every 3 months for up to 1&#xD;
      year. If there are any signs of your tumor getting worse or returning, you will have a&#xD;
      Gd-MRI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an investigational study. Temozolomide is approved by the FDA for the treatment of&#xD;
      some brain tumors and is commercially available. Liposomal cytarabine is authorized for&#xD;
      research use only in the treatment of brain tumors. The use of these two drugs together is&#xD;
      experimental. About 180 patients will take part in this study. About 18 will be enrolled at&#xD;
      UT MD Anderson Cancer Center.&#xD;

&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Patients receiving other therapy (either intrathecal or systemic) designed&#xD;
             specifically to treat their leptomeningeal disease are not eligible for this study.&#xD;
             However, patients receiving concomitant non-cytotoxic therapy (hormonal or cytostatic&#xD;
             therapy) to control systemic disease or bulk CNS disease will be eligible, provided&#xD;
             the therapy is not a phase I agent, an agent which significantly penetrates the CSF or&#xD;
             an agent known to have serious unpredictable CNS side effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. (1. continued) No other cytotoxic chemotherapies are allowed (non-cytotoxic therapies&#xD;
             such as herceptin, tarceva, arimidex etc are allowed at the investigator's&#xD;
