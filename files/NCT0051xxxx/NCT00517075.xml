  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will test whether repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is helpful&#xD;
      in treating negative symptoms and social deficits of schizophrenia. This will be the first&#xD;
      rTMS study to assess social function and social cognition.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Hypoactivity in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) has been implicated in&#xD;
           generating the negative symptoms of schizophrenia. Abnormalities in the left inferior&#xD;
           parietal lobe (IPL) have also been associated with negative symptoms. We hypothesize&#xD;
           that high frequency rTMS applied to the hypoactive left DLPFC or to the left IPL in&#xD;
           individuals with schizophrenia will reduce negative symptom severity more than sham&#xD;
           (placebo) rTMS as assessed by the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) negative&#xD;
           symptoms subscale.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. We hypothesize that high frequency rTMS applied to the left DLPFC or to the left IPL in&#xD;
           schizophrenia patients will improve social dysfunction more than sham (placebo) rTMS as&#xD;
           assessed by the Social Adjustment Scale, the Social Adaptation Self-Evaluation Scale and&#xD;
           the Social Functioning Scale.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Most treatments for schizophrenia are helpful in treating positive symptoms (e.g.&#xD;
      hallucinations), whereas negative symptoms (e.g. low social drive) are only partially&#xD;
      responsive to medication. Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is a&#xD;
      noninvasive way of stimulating the brain that has been FDA approved for the treatment of&#xD;
      depression and has shown promise in schizophrenia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In rTMS therapy, a device called a &quot;magnetic stimulator&quot; provides electrical energy to a&#xD;
      magnetic coil that delivers a magnetic field. When the coil is placed against the surface of&#xD;
      the head, the magnetic field can cause parts of the brain to either increase or decrease in&#xD;
      activity, depending on how quickly the magnetic pulses are delivered. This study is designed&#xD;
      to test whether high-frequency rTMS delivered to an area near the front of the head, called&#xD;
      the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, can improve the &quot;negative symptoms&quot; of schizophrenia,&#xD;
      which include decreased thinking, difficulty motivating, and social withdrawal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participation in the first phase of the study consists of sessions lasting about 45 minutes&#xD;
      per day, 5 days a week, for 4 weeks. Twenty-four subjects will be randomly assigned to&#xD;
      receive four weeks of either active (real) rTMS or inactive (sham) rTMS. Patients will&#xD;
      receive magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of their brains to help locate where the rTMS should&#xD;
      be applied. Symptoms will be rated at baseline, during the rTMS course, and at the end of the&#xD;
      4 weeks. Patients who do not meet response criteria after the four weeks of the randomized&#xD;
      phase will be offered active (real) daily rTMS for an additional four weeks in the open phase&#xD;
      of the study. All patients will have two monthly repeat assessments after their last rTMS&#xD;
      session to examine the persistence of benefit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will also collect measures of motor cortex excitability (performed with single pulse TMS)&#xD;
      at baseline, at the end of the randomized and, if applicable, the open study phase, and at&#xD;
      each of the two follow-up assessments to determine whether changes in these measures&#xD;
      correlate with clinical improvement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, we will look at brain dynamics using electroencephalography (EEG) pre- and&#xD;
      post-rTMS in the first and last sessions of each study phase. We will also assess the effects&#xD;
      of rTMS on cigarette use, as schizophrenia patients are known to have increased prevalence of&#xD;
      nicotine dependence. There is also preliminary evidence that high frequency rTMS to the left&#xD;
      DLPFC decreases cigarette smoking.&#xD;

Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS): For rTMS, the coil is held flat on the scalp. 40 trains of 10 Hz rTMS will be delivered in trains lasting 4 seconds, with an intertrain interval of 26 seconds, for a total of 20 minutes (1600 pulses per day) at 100% motor threshold. Subjects will receive rTMS once a day, 5 days a week, for 4 weeks. During the first week of rTMS sessions only, in the event that the patient cannot tolerate these stimulation parameters, intensity relative to motor threshold may be titrated downward, in a masked fashion, to 80%, with all other dose parameters remaining the same.</description>

          <title>Open Cross Over High Frequency rTMS</title>
          <description>Following the randomization phase with three arms, subjects who did not respond, have the possibility of receiving open active treatment to the target that they did not receive treatment to in the randomization phase. (i.e. randomized to IPL --&gt; open phase DLPFC and vice versa)&#xD;
repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation: For rTMS, the coil is held flat on the scalp. 40 trains of 10 Hz rTMS will be delivered in trains lasting 4 seconds, with an intertrain interval of 26 seconds, for a total of 20 minutes (1600 pulses per day) at 100% motor threshold. Subjects will receive rTMS once a day, 5 days a week, for 4 weeks. During the first week of rTMS sessions only, in the event that the patient cannot tolerate these stimulation parameters, intensity relative to motor threshold may be titrated downward, in a masked fashion, to 80%, with all other dose parameters remaining the same.</description>
