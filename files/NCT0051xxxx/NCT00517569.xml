      The purpose of this study is to assess the safety of GX-12 gene therapy combined with HAART&#xD;
      in the HIV-1 infected patients and to investigate the efficacy with the value of plasma viral&#xD;
      load and with CD4 counts and HIV-1 specific IFN-gamma expressed T-lymphocytes&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Currently, management of HIV infection and AIDS is mainly done by antiviral chemotherapy&#xD;
      which inhibits reverse transcriptase or proteolytic enzyme. The HAART (highly active&#xD;
      antiretroviral therapy) has indeed succeeded extraordinary in decrease of the mortality and&#xD;
      in increase of the life expediency of AIDS patients. However, there have been some&#xD;
      significant limitations of them (for example, treatment fatigues, the side effects, the&#xD;
      emergency of resistant, high medical costs, etc.).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently, there has been a number of bioresearch for immunotherapy to overcome these&#xD;
      limitations of current medications. GX-12 is a genetic using a naked DNA with human IL-12&#xD;
      mutant as immune adjuvant. GX-12 is designed to vaccinate the individuals with HIV antigens,&#xD;
      which is to result in enhancing the HIV specific immunity and to expand broadly the immune&#xD;
      responses nonspecifically.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, the safety and efficacy of GX-12 will be investigated.&#xD;
