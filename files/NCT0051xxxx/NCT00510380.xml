      This study is carried out to discover if a baby with restricted growth in the womb is subject&#xD;
      to specific fetal programming which predisposes to the metabolic&#xD;
      syndrome(diabetes,hypertension,heart disease) in adulthood.We have elected to first study&#xD;
      this condition in Chinese population in Singapore with the eventual plan of studying all&#xD;
      ethnic groups. This is important for understanding the molecular basis of adult-onset disease&#xD;
      such as diabetes, identifying children at risk of developing this disease in future and&#xD;
      targeting specific strategies for intervention and disease prevention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intrauterine fetal programming is effected through epigenetic changes similar to those&#xD;
      previously identified in animal studies. The epigenetic markers can be found in growth&#xD;
      restricted Chinese pregnancies in the local population.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Fetal growth restriction is associated with accelerated postnatal weight gain and increased&#xD;
      obesity risk in later life.International epidemiological data suggest that the phenomenon of&#xD;
      fetal programming links poor intrauterine growth to adult disease, primarily type II&#xD;
      diabetes, obesity and metabolic syndrome, conditions increasingly common in Singapore.&#xD;
      Suboptimal intrauterine environmental condition s are postulated to affect fetal development&#xD;
      through effects on developmental plasticity through epigenetic processes. These effects&#xD;
      manifest as poor glucose resistance, insulin resistance, obesity and cardiovascular disease&#xD;
      in later life. There is increasing animal data to support this model.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to determine if epigenetic markers of the metabolic syndrome are&#xD;
      present in selected Chinese pregnancies in Singapore.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intrauterine fetal programming is effected through epigenetic changes similar to those&#xD;
      previously identified in animal studies. The epigenetic markers can be found in growth&#xD;
      restricted Chinese pregnancies in the local population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology Umbilical cords and cord blood will be collected from twenty unequivocally&#xD;
      growth-restricted Chinese pregnancies and twenty appropriately-grown Chinese pregnancies. DNA&#xD;
      extracted from these tissues will be subjected to a custom-made DNA methylation array probing&#xD;
      for specific changes in 262 candidate genes important to fetal endocrine and metabolic&#xD;
      control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This will be done using either a methylation array or a Sequenorn 2 in the DNA extracts that&#xD;
      have been identified through Epigen academic consortium of the Liggins Institute and UK&#xD;
      collaborators.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anthropometric data will be collected from the infants at birth, and subsequently at&#xD;
      3,6,12,18 and 24 months and we will seek differential measures of programming.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Application The discovery of biomarkers indicating shifted developmental trajectories is the&#xD;
      most important need in developmental programming research. Birth weight alone is not a valid&#xD;
      measure. Biomarkers predictive of later obesity and the metabolic syndrome will be invaluable&#xD;
      in formulating preventive strategies for these diseases.&#xD;
