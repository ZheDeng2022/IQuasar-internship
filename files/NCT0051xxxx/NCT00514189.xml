      Primary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To determine the feasibility of delivering autologous dendritic cells (DCs) loaded with&#xD;
           acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) lysate plus messenger RNA (mRNA) to AML patients&#xD;
           following consolidation therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To determine the toxicity of autologous DCs loaded with AML lysate plus mRNA.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To quantitate immune responses in patients who receive autologous DCs loaded with AML&#xD;
           lysate plus mRNA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To evaluate minimal residual disease following DC therapy using the polymerase chain&#xD;
           reaction assay for the Wilm's Tumor-1 gene.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To asses the disease-free and overall survival of AML patients who receive the&#xD;
           autologous DCs loaded with AML lysate plus mRNA.&#xD;

      Patient Consent: Arm 1 - Standard-Dose Consolidation&#xD;
&#xD;
      The vaccine will be made from your AML cells which will be killed, frozen, and stored away&#xD;
      when you start the study. When you go into remission, researchers will take your normal blood&#xD;
      cells and culture them in the laboratory until they become &quot;dendritic cells.&quot; Researchers&#xD;
      will then thaw your tumor cells and load parts of them into the dendritic cells and inject&#xD;
      the mixture. This type of vaccine will hopefully encourage your immune system to prevent&#xD;
      later relapse of your disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before you can start treatment on this study, you will have what are called &quot;screening&#xD;
      tests.&quot; These tests will help the doctor decide if you are eligible to take part in this&#xD;
      study. Blood (about 1 tablespoon) will be drawn to make sure you do not have an infection&#xD;
      with HIV/AIDS. If you do, you will not be eligible for this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, AML cells will be collected from&#xD;
      your blood through a vein in your arm. A blood separator device called an apheresis machine&#xD;
      will be used. Each apheresis procedure takes about 3-5 hours. It is similar to donating&#xD;
      platelets to a blood bank. During the procedure the blood with tumor cells will be removed&#xD;
      and then returned through a second line in the other arm. You may have bone marrow&#xD;
      aspirations instead with general anesthesia, usually lasting up to 3 hours. To collect a bone&#xD;
      marrow aspirate, an area of the hip or chest bone is numbed with anesthetic, and a small&#xD;
      amount of bone marrow is withdrawn through a large needle. The AML cells collected by either&#xD;
      the apheresis or bone marrow collection procedure will be used later to make the vaccine in&#xD;
      the M. D. Anderson Cell Therapy Laboratory where they will be frozen and stored until it is&#xD;
      time to make the vaccine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the AML cells are collected, you will start receiving your induction and consolidation&#xD;
      chemotherapy treatment. This treatment is standard of care and is not directly related to&#xD;
      your participation in this study. After your first cycle of consolidation treatment, a bone&#xD;
      marrow biopsy will be done to find out if you are in complete remission. To collect a bone&#xD;
      marrow biopsy, an area of the hip or chest bone is numbed with anesthetic, and a small amount&#xD;
      of bone marrow and bone is withdrawn through a large needle. If you are in complete remission&#xD;
      then you will have your normal blood stem cells collected, which will be used to make the&#xD;
      vaccine. All of the normal stem cells will be collected with the same apheresis machine used&#xD;
      to collect tumor cells. Beginning 5 days before the first collection, you will receive daily&#xD;
      injections under the skin of granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF). These are given&#xD;
      to increase the number of normal stem cells available for collection. On Days 5 and 6 of&#xD;
      G-CSF treatment, your normal stem cells will be collected. They will be taken to the M. D.&#xD;
      Anderson Cell Therapy Laboratory where they will be frozen and stored until it is time to&#xD;
      make the vaccine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After you complete the apheresis procedure to collect normal cells, you will continue&#xD;
      consolidation therapy (typically 3-5 cycles). The vaccine will be made with your previously&#xD;
      frozen cells. Once thawed, a machine called the CliniMACS will be used to isolate the cells&#xD;
      from your blood that will be grown into the vaccine during an 8-day procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the last consolidation cycle, you will begin to receive 4 monthly injections of the&#xD;
      vaccine. The first vaccination will be given once your blood counts have recovered from the&#xD;
      final dose of chemotherapy. The remaining 3 vaccinations will be given every 28 days (+/- 7&#xD;
      days). Once it is ready, each vaccine will be injected into a lymph node in your groin. A&#xD;
      special machine called a sonogram (typically used to look at babies in the womb) will be used&#xD;
      to painlessly locate exactly where the injection should go.&#xD;
&#xD;
      About 3-7 days after each vaccine, about 4 tablespoons of your blood will be drawn to measure&#xD;
      the immune reaction to the vaccine. At that time you will also have a skin test performed to&#xD;
      look for the presence or absence of an immune reaction to the vaccine. This will be done with&#xD;
      a small injection under the skin on your forearm. About 48 hours later, researchers will&#xD;
      measure the area around the injection for redness, which would be a sign that your immune&#xD;
      system is reacting to the vaccine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After you have received all 4 vaccines, you will be seen in the clinic yearly to evaluate how&#xD;
      you tolerated the vaccines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Routine long-term follow-up exams will be performed by your leukemia doctor as per standard&#xD;
      of care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an investigational study. The vaccines are not commercially available and only&#xD;
      authorized for use in research. A total of 40 patients will take part in this study. All will&#xD;
      be enrolled at M. D. Anderson.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient Consent: Arm 2 - Autologous Peripheral Blood Progenitor Cell Consolidation&#xD;
&#xD;
      The vaccine will be made from your AML cells which will be killed, frozen, and stored away&#xD;
      when you start the study. When you go into remission, researchers will take your normal blood&#xD;
      cells and culture them in the laboratory until they become &quot;dendritic cells.&quot; Researchers&#xD;
      will then thaw your tumor cells and load parts of them into the dendritic cells and inject&#xD;

&#xD;
      After you complete the apheresis procedure to collect normal cells, you will continue&#xD;
      consolidation therapy with high-dose standard busulfan and cyclophosphamide chemotherapy. You&#xD;
      will also have an autologous peripheral blood progenitor cell transplant. The chemotherapy&#xD;
      and transplant are standard of care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the chemotherapy and transplant when your blood counts have recovered, you will begin&#xD;
      to receive 4 monthly injections of the vaccine. The vaccine will be made with your previously&#xD;
      frozen cells. Once thawed, a machine called the CliniMACS will be used to isolate the cells&#xD;
