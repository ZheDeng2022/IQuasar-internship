      The purpose of this study is to determine if atomoxetine (a common brand name is Strattera),&#xD;
      a medicine that is used for treating older children with Attention Deficit and Hyperactivity&#xD;
      Disorder (ADHD), is also safe and helpful for ADHD problems in young children. While&#xD;
      atomoxetine is not approved by the FDA for use in children younger than 6 years, the FDA has&#xD;
      given permission to study this drug in this age group.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Prevalence of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder ADHD in school age children is&#xD;
      estimated to be 2% to 11%. Many preschool age children have problems with hyperactivity,&#xD;
      short attention span, impulsivity and other behavior dyscontrol and are quite likely to&#xD;
      continue to have difficulties in elementary school years. Many of these children are referred&#xD;
      for diagnosis and management of their difficult behavior and are diagnosed with ADHD.&#xD;
      Children with ADHD often display disruptive behaviors that interfere with their functioning&#xD;
      at school, home and in the community due to symptoms of hyperactivity, impulsiveness and&#xD;
      inattention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Symptoms of ADHD may be underdiagnosed and undertreated in preschool children. Preschool&#xD;
      children with ADHD often require vigilant monitoring and supervision to ensure their safety.&#xD;
      Symptoms of impulsivity, hyperactivity and distractibility often limit the effectiveness of&#xD;
      educational and behavioral interventions. Hence, it is important to treat the symptoms of&#xD;
      ADHD in children at an early age. Early intervention in children with ADHD may have an impact&#xD;
      in the course of illness by abating longer-term disability in vulnerable children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pharmacological agents are considered a standard treatment recommendation in children with&#xD;
      ADHD. Recently, a non-stimulant pharmacological agent, atomoxetine (ATMX), has been reported&#xD;
      to be effective and safe in school-age children with ADHD. Data are not available for the&#xD;
      usefulness of ATMX in children younger than 6 years. However, parents of younger children&#xD;
      with ADHD are frequently asking practicing physicians to prescribe ATMX for their child since&#xD;
      they do not want their child taking stimulants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is a need to carry out treatment trials with ATMX in preschool children with ADHD in&#xD;
      order to collect data on how effective the drug is, its safety, and the best doses to&#xD;
      administer to children with ADHD. Therefore, this study will be a pilot project to obtain&#xD;
      preliminary data that will then be used to help set up a larger study that will examine&#xD;
      preschool children with ADHD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All subjects will be screened for eligibility inclusion and exclusion criteria. Since other&#xD;
      therapies including behavior therapy are routinely indicated, for ethical reasons subjects&#xD;
      will continue to receive all concurrent therapies throughout the study period. All concurrent&#xD;
      therapies will be stabilized for a minimum period of 2 weeks prior to the child's entry into&#xD;
      the drug phase of the study. At each medication follow-up visit, a detailed history will be&#xD;
      obtained and recorded for all concurrent treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If a child enrolls in this study, his/her participation will last approximately 7 to 13 weeks&#xD;
      with a minimum of 7 outpatient daytime visits. The visits will be weekly in the beginning and&#xD;
      then every other week once the child is taking an optimum dose of atomoxetine. Visits will&#xD;
      take 1-5 hours each and will take place at the Department of Psychiatry in the Arizona Health&#xD;
      Sciences Center (Tucson). The study consists of 2 periods.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening assessment: The screening visit(s) is/are used to determine if a child is eligible&#xD;
      for participation. The child's teacher/daycare provider (with the parent's permission) and&#xD;
      the parent(s) will need to complete some forms describing the child's problems with&#xD;
      overactivity, impulsivity and inattention. The screening assessments may be completed over&#xD;
      1-2 visits. Each visit will take about 3-5 hours to complete. The research staff will&#xD;
      evaluate each child to see if s/he has ADHD. Parents will be interviewed about their child's&#xD;
      behavior. The child's teacher will be given several rating forms to complete. Parents will be&#xD;
      asked to complete some questions about their child's development. Both parents (if available)&#xD;
      and will be interviewed about their family histories.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After it is determined that a child is eligible to participate, there will be a baseline&#xD;
      visit. The child's previous ineffective medication will be discontinued. The ratings done at&#xD;
      the first visit will be repeated, including both the teacher and parent rating scales. The&#xD;
      child will have vital signs taken including height, weight, blood pressure and pulse rate, an&#xD;
      electrocardiogram (EKG) (a test of heart rhythm recorded by putting sticky pads on the&#xD;
      chest), a urine test and a blood test (about 10cc or 1 tablespoon). The doctor will ask the&#xD;
      parents about the child's medical history. Parents will be told about any abnormal laboratory&#xD;
      values or physical findings that may be discovered during this study. This information will&#xD;
      also be available to the child's pediatrician if the parents request this be done.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Medication phase: After screening assessments are completed, the child will enter the&#xD;
      medication phase of the study. The child will be started on atomoxetine at 0.5 mg/kg/day,&#xD;
      with the dosage increased to a maximum dose of 1.8 mg/kg/day. The dose will be determined by&#xD;
      how well the child responds to and tolerates the drug. The dose will be given twice a day to&#xD;
      minimize side effects. After the optimum dose is determined, the child will be kept at this&#xD;
      stable dose for 4 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At each visit, vital signs will be taken including height, weight, blood pressure, and pulse&#xD;
      rate. Interviews, play assessments, checklist, and questionnaires will be completed at each&#xD;
      visit in order to assess how well the child is doing, and whether there are symptoms or side&#xD;
      effects. Teachers will also continue to be asked to fill out assessments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the child's behavior gets worse or s/he experiences any side effects, parents should call&#xD;
      the study doctor immediately and it will be determined if any changes in the child's&#xD;
      treatment will need to be made. Participants will be given a card with telephone numbers and&#xD;
      important information needed to get in touch with the doctor at any time, day or night.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Some of the screening assessments will be videotaped/audiotaped. These tapes will be used for&#xD;
      later coding, supervision of the child's doctor/therapist, review by offsite&#xD;
      consultants/mentors, training of other doctors/therapists, and/or for presentations at&#xD;
      conferences. The tapes can be erased at any time during or after the session at the parent's&#xD;
      request.&#xD;
