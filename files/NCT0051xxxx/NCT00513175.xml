      The primary objective of this study is to examine transplant related mortality (TRM) at 100&#xD;
      days &lt;30%. A TRM of &gt;50% is considered unacceptable. This study also seeks a TRM at 12 months&#xD;
      that is &lt;50%, engraftment &gt;90% (defined as donor cells &gt;80% at 6 months), and 1 year overall&#xD;
      survival &gt;50%.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  &lt;75 years old&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Availability of suitable matched unrelated donor. We will require HLA matching at 9 of&#xD;
             10 loci including HLA A, B, C, DR and DQ. For patients treated at UCSF, typing will be&#xD;
             done in the UCSF Immunogenetics Department. Typing will be done by high-resolution&#xD;
             techniques at the allele level. Donors will be recruited through the National Marrow&#xD;
             Donor Program (NMDP). Donors must meet the standards of NMDP as well as Institutional&#xD;
             standards for donors at the center for which they are being collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Disease must be stable or responding to therapy. The expected time to disease&#xD;
             progression should be greater than 12 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Disease types include:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Acute myeloid leukemia not expected to be curable with chemotherapy. This will&#xD;
                  include patients with high-risk cytogenetics (-7, -7q, -5, -5q, complex, Ph+),&#xD;
                  evolution from prior myelodysplasia or AML secondary to prior chemotherapy,&#xD;
                  failure to achieve remission, or second or subsequent remission. To ensure&#xD;
                  adequate time until disease progression, marrow blasts must be &lt;10%. This may be&#xD;
                  achieved using chemotherapy treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Myelodysplasia with high-risk features. These will include adverse cytogenetics&#xD;
                  (-7, -7q, -5, -5q, complex), excess blasts, prior conversion to AML, or severe&#xD;
                  cytopenias, with ANC&lt;500uL or platelets &lt;20,000uL. Marrow blasts must be &lt;10%.&#xD;
                  This may be achieved using chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Acute lymphoblastic leukemia not expected to be curable with chemotherapy. This&#xD;
                  will include patients with high-risk cytogenetics (Ph+, 11q23 abnormalities, and&#xD;
                  monosomy 7), patients requiring more than one induction course to achieve&#xD;
                  remission, as well as patients failing to enter remission or in second or&#xD;
                  subsequent remission. Marrow blasts must be &lt;10%.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Chronic lymphocytic leukemia with high-risk features. This will include&#xD;
                  refractoriness to initial or subsequent therapy, progression after initial&#xD;
                  response to therapy, or prolymphocytic (PLL) morphology.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Follicular lymphoma with high-risk features. This will include refractoriness to&#xD;
                  initial or subsequent therapy, progression after response to initial therapy, or&#xD;
                  &gt; or equal 3 IPI risk factors.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Multiple myeloma, stage II-III. Patients are eligible either at diagnosis or&#xD;

                  thrombocytosis) with evidence of disease acceleration.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Chronic myeloid leukemia with failure disease control by Imatinib.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Renal cell carcinoma with metastatic disease&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Aplastic anemia not responsive to immunosuppressive therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Laboratory requirements (within 2 weeks of entry, EF and DLCO within 4 weeks):&#xD;

&#xD;
               -  Bilirubin &lt;3mg/dL, AST &lt;4x upper limit of normal. Patients with elevated total&#xD;
                  bilirubin who are suspected of having Gilbert's Disease will be eligible if the&#xD;
                  direct bilirubin is normal.&#xD;

                  above criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Cardiac ejection fraction &gt;30%&#xD;
&#xD;

          -  Absence of uncontrolled active infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prior stem cell (or bone marrow) transplantation is permitted&#xD;
