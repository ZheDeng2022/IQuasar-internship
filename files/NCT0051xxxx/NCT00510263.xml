      The main objective of this study is to study the effects of prednisolone and valaciclovir,&#xD;
      with equal importance, compared to placebo for the treatment of Bell´s palsy. The combination&#xD;
      of prednisolone and valaciclovir will also be studied.&#xD;

      Study Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a multicentre randomised double-blind placebo-controlled study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study medication:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prednisolone 60 mg per day for 5 days, after that tapering 10 mg per day for a total&#xD;
      treatment time of 10 days. Valaciclovir 1000 mg 3 times per day for 7 days. Prednisolone and&#xD;
      valaciclovir are used in combination or separately. One patient of four receives placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Duration:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study medication will be taken during 10 days. The subjects will be followed for 12 months&#xD;
      after initiation of treatment. Follow-up visits will be 11-15 days after start of therapy and&#xD;
      at 1, 2, 3, 6 and 12 months after the onset of palsy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Setting:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be conducted in 17 ENT-clinics in Sweden and Finland, which will be monitored&#xD;
      by the members of the board of the Scandinavian Bells Palsy Study (SBPS)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Subjects:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Otherwise healthy subjects with unilateral acute idiopathic facial palsy. A total of 800&#xD;
      subjects will be included in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Treatments:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The subjects will be randomised to one of the following treatment arms for oral&#xD;
      administration of study drug:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Prednisolone + placebo&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Valaciclovir + placebo&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Prednisolone + valaciclovir&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Placebo + placebo&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment will be initiated within 72 hours of onset of palsy and continued during 10 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measurements:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first follow-up clinical examination is scheduled within 3 days after completed&#xD;
      treatment. Further follow-up visits are scheduled at 1, 2, 3 and 6 months from onset of&#xD;
      palsy. If complete recovery has occurred at the 2 month visit, the 3 and 6 months visits are&#xD;
      not necessary. If complete recovery is present at 3 months the 6 month visit can be excluded.&#xD;
      A final follow-up exam is always performed at 12 months. The clinical examination includes a&#xD;
      routine examination of ear, nose and throat, grading of the palsy according to the Sunnybrook&#xD;
      and House Brackmann grading scales and registration of other symptoms as pain, eye&#xD;
      irritation, dysacusis and impaired taste. Blood tests for Lyme Borreliosis are drawn at the&#xD;
      acute (the first) visit and at the follow-up visit at 2 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Endpoint:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary endpoint will be the time to complete clinical recovery (defined as 100 on the&#xD;
      Sunnybrook facial nerve grading scale) from Bell's palsy. The subjects will be categorised as&#xD;
      healed or not healed at months 1, 2, 3, 6 or 12 months. Treatments will be compared using the&#xD;
      Generalized Wilcoxon rank sum test. Patients where data are missing and there is no healing&#xD;
      time will be included as censored at the last visit when the patient was not healed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary endpoints:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary endpoints of this study are comparisons between the different treatment arms&#xD;
      with regard to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Proportion of patients with complete healing of palsy compared to those with incomplete&#xD;
           healing at12 months after onset.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Influence on outcome at 12 months by time in hours from onset of palsy until beginning&#xD;
           of study medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Proportion of patients that develop severe palsy during the first week from onset.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The total duration of pain, in or around the ipsilateral ear or the ipsilateral side of&#xD;
           the face, from onset of palsy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The proportion of subjects with severe pain (more than VAS 3) in the different treatment&#xD;
           arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Occurrence of synkinesia in the different treatment arms at any time.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Occurrence of facial spasm or contracture in the different treatment arms at any time.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Severity of remaining facial symptoms in patients not healed at 12 months and at each&#xD;
           prescheduled study visit as recorded by Sunnybrook Facial Grading System.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety Evaluations:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adverse events will be assessed during the first study month. Adverse events will be reported&#xD;
      in the patient's files and in the patient CRF for this study.&#xD;
