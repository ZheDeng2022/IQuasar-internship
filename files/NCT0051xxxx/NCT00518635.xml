      Study hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Growth hormone (GH), through its generation of free 'bioavailable' insulin-like growth factor&#xD;
      (IGF)-I, can improve insulin sensitivity and the metabolic profile of women with polycystic&#xD;
      ovary syndrome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine the mechanism of how low dose GH treatment affects the body's sensitivity to&#xD;
      insulin actions and whether this low GH dose can affect the body's handling of steroid&#xD;
      hormone levels (cortisol clearance) and testosterone (male hormones) in obese women with&#xD;
      polycystic ovary syndrome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Obese women with polycystic ovary syndrome, but not recently been on GH treatment, and&#xD;
      presently attending Outpatients Clinic will be invited to participate in this study. The&#xD;
      subjects will be assessed at the initial visit to ascertain their suitability before further&#xD;
      participating in the study. If suitable, an equal number of women will be randomized to&#xD;
      receive either daily low dose GH or placebo injections first for 12 weeks, before exchanging&#xD;
      over for another 12 weeks of treatment after a 4-week washout period. Before, during and&#xD;
      after treatment, the subjects will be assessed at frequently with blood tests, scans and fat&#xD;
      biopsies. During the study, the subjects will be studied 4 times at the Oregon Clinical and&#xD;
      Translational Research Institute (OCTRI). At the first, second and final visit, testing will&#xD;
      include scans to measure the amount of whole body fat and fat in the stomach area, muscle,&#xD;
      and liver; blood tests to measure levels of cortisol, and fat tissue (taken from a biopsy)&#xD;
      analysis to measure the density of insulin-like growth factor-I (a hormone stimulated by&#xD;
      growth hormone in the body) in fat; whereas blood tests to examine how well insulin works in&#xD;
      the body (insulin sensitivity) will be collected at all visits of the study.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will be a double-blinded cross-over study. Thirty subjects will be screened for&#xD;
      eligibility initially, and the first 12 eligible subjects will be enrolled. Six subjects will&#xD;
      be randomized to receive the low GH dose (0.1 mg/day) treatment and 6 subjects to receive&#xD;
      Placebo treatment for 12 weeks, exchanging their treatment for a further 12 weeks after a&#xD;
      4-week washout period. The study drugs will be stored at the Oregon Health and Science&#xD;
      University (OHSU) Research Pharmacy and following randomization, the subjects will be taught&#xD;
      by our Endocrine Nurses to self-administer the subcutaneous GH and Placebo injections using&#xD;
      Nutropin/Placebo vials and insulin syringes into the abdomen at 2200h. Randomization for&#xD;
      treatment assignment will be performed by an investigator not directly involved in the&#xD;
      patients' recruitment, treatment and follow-up care. The randomization process will be&#xD;
      performed by computerized pre-assigned random codes by blocks, stratified by age and examined&#xD;
      for possible differences in body mass index. During their in-patient stay at the Oregon&#xD;
      Clinical and Translational Research Institute (OCTRI) at OHSU, subjects will only be allowed&#xD;
      to eat the food provided to them by the OCTRI.&#xD;
