  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Recently published work has examined the effects of &quot;atypical antipsychotics&quot; in&#xD;
      SSRI-treatment resistant patients. In these studies, patients with unipolar depression who&#xD;
      were treated with SSRI's, but not responsive to treatment after 4 or more weeks, were&#xD;
      supplemented with an atypical. The atypical antipsychotics were found to diminish depression&#xD;
      symptoms, as well as benefit sleep quality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We propose a similar study with Quetiapine XR, focusing on thinking processes, mood and&#xD;
      anxiety. Patients with depression who are SSRI treatment resistant will be treated with&#xD;
      Quetiapine. Cognition will be evaluated in the UBC Mood Disorders Clinic two times: first&#xD;
      before Quetiapine addition, then after 8 weeks. Depression symptoms and other measurements&#xD;
      will be done at the 9 time points: before Quetiapine, and each week after treatment has&#xD;
      begun.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary purpose of this study is to evaluate the superiority of Quetiapine XR compared to&#xD;
      placebo as augmentation therapy in treatment of anxiety and depressive symptoms in&#xD;
      SSRI-nonresponsive unipolar patients. Secondarily, we would like to evaluate the safety and&#xD;
      tolerability of quetiapine as augmentation therapy in SSRI-nonresponsive unipolar patients.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This is a double-blind, placebo-controlled study, in which patients will receive treatment of&#xD;
      Quetiapine XR for 8 weeks. All patients will receive Quetiapine XR at an initial dose of&#xD;
      50mg/day to be increased incrementally (dose of 50mg/day 2 and 150mg/day 3) to achieve a&#xD;
      target dose of 300 mg/day by day 4. Tablets will be self-administered early each night.&#xD;
      Patient's results will be compared to their own baseline measurements, in a double-blind&#xD;
      fashion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruited patients will be evaluated at nine time points: a baseline prior to treatment (t =&#xD;
      -7 days), an assessment one week after treatment has begun (t = 7 days), two weeks after (t =&#xD;
      14 days), three weeks after (t = 21 days), four weeks after (t = 28 days), five weeks after&#xD;
      (t = 35 days), six weeks after (t = 42 days), seven weeks after (t = 49 days) and after 8&#xD;
      weeks of treatment (t = 56 days). Evaluation of cognition, mood and anxiety, will be done&#xD;
      blind to which time point is being measured.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Basic blood work (fasting blood glucose, lipid screen including triglycerides, urea and&#xD;
      electrolytes, cytokines and neuroimmune markers) will performed on each patient both at&#xD;
      baseline (t = -7 days) and at t = 56 days. At 4 weeks, blood sample will be taken for fasting&#xD;
      plasma glucose, HbA1c and transaminases. At baseline (-7 days) and completion (56 days) a&#xD;
      battery of neurocognitive-impairment tests (see Appendix A) will be administered. In&#xD;
      addition, the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (21-ITEM HAM-D GRID), Montgomery -Asberg&#xD;
      Depression Rating Scale (MADRS), Hamilton Ratings Scale for Anxiety (HAM-A), the UKU Side&#xD;
      Effect Rating Scale, and the Quality of Life Enjoyment and Satisfaction Questionnaire&#xD;
      (Q-LES-Q) will also be assessed by the research team.&#xD;
