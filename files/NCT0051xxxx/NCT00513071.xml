  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial is studying how well AZD0530 works in treating patients with prostate&#xD;
      cancer that did not respond to hormone therapy. AZD0530 may stop the growth of tumor cells by&#xD;
      blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To test the hypothesis that AZD0530 will improve the prostate-specific antigen (PSA)&#xD;
      response rate and progression-free survival (PFS) in comparison with historical controls for&#xD;
      patients with hormone-refractory prostate cancer (HRPC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Evaluate the time to treatment failure and overall survival of patients with HRPC treated&#xD;
      with AZD0530.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. Evaluate the toxicities and tolerance of AZD0530 therapy in the HRPC population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive oral AZD0530 once daily. Treatment repeats every 4 weeks for up to 2 courses&#xD;
      in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 6 months for the first 2&#xD;
      years and then yearly thereafter.&#xD;
