  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This investigator initiated study, single-blinded, parallel, randomized study will be&#xD;
      conducted in subjects with 2 or more keloids similar in size and duration on a similar area&#xD;
      of the body. The response of the closure techniques will be evaluated by clinical and&#xD;
      instrumental assessments. Each qualified subject will be assessed and the keloids will be&#xD;
      randomly assigned to the Clozex or suture closure. One keloid will be surgically excised and&#xD;
      the surgical wound generated will be randomized to be closed with Clozex. A second keloid&#xD;
      will be surgically excised and the surgical wound generated will be randomized to be closed&#xD;
      with sutures. The inflammation index and the keloid recurrence rate at each surgical wound&#xD;
      closure site will be compared.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will be undertaken to compare the efficacy of two closure techniques for excised&#xD;
      keloids. (1) Clozex, a non-latex, hypoallergenic adhesive polymeric interlaced film designed&#xD;
      to adhere to proximal wound edges for 7-10 days, will be used after the punch biopsy or&#xD;
      excision of a keloid and (2) sutures to close a similar second keloid after the punch biopsy&#xD;
      or excision of a keloid.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On day 12, the investigator and subject will assess the keloid site(s) with the use of a&#xD;
      visual analog scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is an optional follow-up at 3 months and 6 months to assess the recurrence of the&#xD;
      keloid and the effectiveness of the treatments with a visual analog scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The subject will assess the keloid site(s) with the use of the following visual analog scale:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Cosmetic appearance&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Pain&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Tenderness&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Itching&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Oozing&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Redness&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Warmth&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigator will assess the keloid site(s) with the use of this visual analog scale:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Global appearance&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Color&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Matte/Shiny&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Contour&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Distortion&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Texture&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Oozing&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. Redness&#xD;
&#xD;
        9. Warmth&#xD;
&#xD;
       10. Firmness&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Male or females, in good health, and at least 12 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Individuals with 2 or more keloids on the trunk, arm, leg, and neck between 0.5 and 2&#xD;
             cm in length.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Individuals who are willing and able to participate in the requirements of the study,&#xD;
             including signing the informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  In the opinion of the investigator, the 2 keloids can be excised in a similar manner&#xD;
             and closed properly with the two techniques and will benefit from the procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  In the opinion of the investigator, the keloid could benefit from surgical procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Individuals with keloids that do not fit into the criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Individuals who are planning pregnancy, pregnant, or breast feeding.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Individuals with a history of medical or dermatologic conditions which, in the opinion&#xD;
             of the investigator, would put the subject at heightened risk or would limit&#xD;
             complicate the study evaluations required by the protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Individuals who present with excessive body hair in the designed keloid area.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Individuals with uncontrolled diabetes.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Individuals with autoimmune disorders (HIV/AIDs, SLE).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects who have received keloid treatment within one month of the first day of the&#xD;
             study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Individuals who plan to receive keloid treatment(s) during the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Individuals who are currently taking prescription or over the counter medication or&#xD;
             interventions on a regular basis that as part of their mechanism of action, have the&#xD;
             potential to mask an inflammatory reaction. Examples of such medications include, but&#xD;
             are not limited to, corticosteroids, non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs),&#xD;
             antihistamines, aspirin (81mg or less daily dosage permissible), or other medications&#xD;
             that in the opinion of the investigator or designee may expose the subject to&#xD;
             heightened risk or complicate the study assessments.&#xD;
