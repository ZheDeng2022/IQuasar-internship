      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as temozolomide and VNP40101M, work in different&#xD;
      ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from&#xD;
      dividing. Temozolomide may also stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking blood flow to the&#xD;
      tumor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE: This phase I/II trial is studying the side effects and best dose of VNP40101M when&#xD;
      given together with temozolomide and to see how well it works in treating patients with&#xD;
      progressive or relapsed malignant glioma.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of VNP40101M when administered with&#xD;
           temozolomide in patients with progressive or relapsed (first relapse) malignant glioma.&#xD;
           (Phase I)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To record the toxicities of VNP40101M when administered with temozolomide. (Phase I and&#xD;
           II)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To measure the level of AGT expression in peripheral blood monocytes before treatment&#xD;
           with temozolomide and just prior to the administration of VNP40101M. (Phase I and II)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine MGMT methylation status as well as other methylation patterns in blood and&#xD;
           tissue from patients treated with this regimen and correlate with outcome. (Phase I and&#xD;
           II)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the 6- and 12-month progression-free survival rates of patients treated&#xD;
           with this regimen. (Phase II)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine overall survival of patients treated with this regimen. (Phase II)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the complete and partial response rates in patients treated with this&#xD;
           regimen. (Phase II)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine CSF penetration of VNP40101M once the MTD is reached from phase I and&#xD;
           correlate with serum/plasma pharmacokinetics. (Phase II)&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Phase I: Patients receive oral temozolomide on days 1-7 and VNP40101M IV over 15-30&#xD;
           minutes 2 hours after the last dose of temozolomide on day 7. Treatment repeats every 7&#xD;
           weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of VNP40101M until the maximum tolerated&#xD;
      dose (MTD) is determined The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2&#xD;
      of 6 patients experience dose limiting toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Phase II: Patients receive oral temozolomide and VNP40101M as in phase I. VNP40101M is&#xD;
           given at the MTD determined in phase I.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In both phases, patients complete the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Brain (FACT-BR)&#xD;
      questionnaire on day 1 of each course.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood is collected for in vitro isolation of mononuclear cells for analysis of O^6&#xD;
      alkylguanine DNA alkyltransferase on days 1 and 7 of course 1. Blood, plasma, CSF, and&#xD;
      formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue blocks are collected for gene methylation studies,&#xD;
      including MGMT, at baseline and on day 1 of each course.&#xD;

    <description>CLORETAZINE will be administered intravenously on day 7. The starting dose of CLORETAZINE will be 100 mg/m2 given within 3 hours after the last dose of Temodar on day 7. CLORETAZINE will be given as an IV infusion over 15-30 minutes via a freely flowing peripheral or central intravenous line. CLORETAZINE will be escalated by 50 mg/m2 for the second cohort then by 25 mg/m2 increments in the following cohorts of 3-6 patients using a standard phase I trial design until a MTD is determined. If dose level 2 has two DLTs then patients will be accrued to a new dose level of 125 mg/m2. Prior to receiving Cloretazine, blood will be drawn for gene methylation studies.</description>
