      The aims include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To measure the effect of the three study conditions on Quality of Life (QOL).&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  CHESS and Cancer Information Mentor will not differ initially (6 weeks) or late in&#xD;
                treatment (6 months) in QOL&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  CHESS +Cancer Information Mentor will have the largest impact on QOL (initially and&#xD;
                late in treatment) and will be significantly better than either CHESS or Cancer&#xD;
                Information Mentor alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To measure potential intervening or mediating processes, so that we can determine how&#xD;
           CHESS and the Cancer Information Mentor produce associated QOL benefits.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To conduct exploratory use analyses examining which types of CHESS content, sequential&#xD;
           patterns of content use, or other characteristics of use behavior are associated with&#xD;
           greater pretest-posttest improvements in QOL.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To conduct a secondary analysis exploring whether men whose partners have actively used&#xD;
           CHESS do better than those whose partners did not use CHESS.&#xD;

      CHESS and Cancer Information Mentoring:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Researchers want to learn the best way to improve a man with prostate cancer's knowledge,&#xD;
      coping skills, and satisfaction with decision-making and overall quality of life. This study&#xD;
      will do this by comparing the following 3 methods of receiving information, social support,&#xD;
      and skill training: using the CHESS system for 6 months, talking to a Cancer Information&#xD;
      Mentor for 6 months, or using the CHESS system and talking to a Cancer Information Mentor for&#xD;
      6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CHESS is an interactive, internet-based computer program that will provide information,&#xD;
      social support, and skill-building techniques. CHESS provides the latest medical, social, and&#xD;
      legal information about prostate cancer (such as information on symptoms and treatments). It&#xD;
      also provides help in deciding what treatment to choose, advice on where participants can go&#xD;
      for help, information on how participants can make the best use of health and human services,&#xD;
      and a way for participants to share concerns with cancer information specialists and other&#xD;
      survivors of prostate cancer. Participants who take part in the CHESS interactive services&#xD;
      will not need to give their names. Participants can talk with other people by sending&#xD;
      anonymous (your identity will be unknown) messages through the CHESS computer network.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cancer Information Mentoring is provided by a person called a &quot;cancer information mentor&quot;&#xD;
      that will give quality prostate cancer information and explain medical information and&#xD;
      procedures. The cancer information mentor is a certified information specialist trained by&#xD;
      the National Cancer Institute (NCI). This mentor will not provide medical advice or mental&#xD;
      health counseling.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you agree to take part in this study, you will be randomly assigned (as in the roll of&#xD;
      dice) to 1 of 3 groups. No matter which group you are assigned to, you will be loaned a&#xD;
      computer with internet access to use in your own home (unless you have your own computer and&#xD;
      would prefer to use it). The computer will be sent to your home, and you will be trained on&#xD;
      how to use the computer and the CHESS system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants in Group 1 will have access to the CHESS system. Participants in Group 2 will&#xD;
      talk with a cancer information mentor. Participants in Group 3 will have access to the CHESS&#xD;
      system and talk with a cancer information mentor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Participation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      CHESS Participants in Group 1 and Group 3 who receive the CHESS internet-based program will&#xD;
      have access to information, social support, and skill-building services. The CHESS system&#xD;
      will keep a record of how often and for how long each part of CHESS is used. Information will&#xD;
      also be gathered about anything you communicate in the CHESS interactions. This information&#xD;
      will be used to figure out which parts of CHESS may be most useful. You will be provided a&#xD;
      free 1-800 phone number for computer support if you need any help.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cancer Information Mentoring:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients in Group 2 and Group 3 will have access to a cancer information mentor. The mentor&#xD;
      will make regular telephone calls to the patient during the study. He will receive 10 calls&#xD;
      in total (4 calls the first month, 2 calls the second month, and one call each in Months&#xD;
      3-6). Patients can also call the cancer information mentor whenever they wish during this&#xD;
      period. Each call will last as long as the patient needs it to.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For patients in Group 3, the cancer information mentor will communicate with them through&#xD;
      CHESS as well as by telephone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Surveys:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will fill out 5 surveys during this study. The surveys will include&#xD;
      questions about health, treatment decisions, knowledge of prostate cancer, and quality of&#xD;
      life. You will complete the first survey before you get the computer and again at 2 weeks, 6&#xD;
      weeks, 3 months, and 6 months after getting the computer. The surveys should take about 30&#xD;
      minutes to finish each time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Length of Study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will last up to a little over 6 months (about 24 weeks).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 327 men and 327 support persons will take part in this multicenter study. Up to 127&#xD;
      participants and 127 support persons will be enrolled at M. D. Anderson.&#xD;
