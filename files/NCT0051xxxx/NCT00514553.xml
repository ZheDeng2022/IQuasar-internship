  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will compare the effectiveness of two interventions to help women make informed&#xD;
      choices about whether or not to undergo an invasive procedure (amniocentesis or chorionic&#xD;
      villus sampling) for prenatal testing. The interventions are: 1) conscious deliberation&#xD;
      (getting women to focus on and engage in the decision) and 2) unconscious deliberation&#xD;
      (getting women not to focus on the decision). Studies suggest that some women are ambivalent&#xD;
      about their decisions regarding invasive prenatal testing and those with the most ambivalence&#xD;
      experience greater conflict about the decision. Techniques to reduce ambivalence through&#xD;
      conscious or unconscious deliberation might lead to better informed choices. The two methods&#xD;
      will also be compared with standard counseling for prenatal testing decisions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Women 18 years of age or older who are referred for prenatal genetic counseling to consider&#xD;
      invasive prenatal testing and who have not previously undergone prenatal testing may be&#xD;
      eligible for this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants complete a questionnaire before and after receiving standard genetic counseling.&#xD;
      They are then randomly assigned to one of three study groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Standard genetic counseling (control group): Receives no further intervention beyond&#xD;
           standard counseling.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Conscious deliberation: Participants complete a form that focuses their attention on the&#xD;
           pros and cons of invasive prenatal testing. This is followed by a brief questionnaire to&#xD;
           evaluate time spent thinking about the session and the ease of completing the session.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Unconscious deliberation: Participants are provided a distraction task to complete&#xD;
           during the session, such as a word or number puzzle and are told they will be asked&#xD;
           about their decision regarding invasive prenatal testing at the end of the session. This&#xD;
           is followed by a brief questionnaire to evaluate time spent thinking about the session&#xD;
           and the ease of completing the session.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants are contacted by telephone 1 month after the counseling session to find out what&#xD;
      they decided regarding invasive prenatal testing and to assess any conflict they experienced&#xD;
      about the decision.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This study will compare the efficacy of two interventions aimed at facilitating informed&#xD;
      choice about invasive prenatal testing: a) deliberation with attention and b) deliberation&#xD;
      without attention. Deliberation with attention is conscious engagement and deliberation&#xD;
      without attention is aimed at facilitating unconscious engagement. These will be compared&#xD;
      with standard counseling for prenatal testing decisions. As a proof of principle study, the&#xD;
      overall study goal is to demonstrate that the interventions have the desired effect on the&#xD;
      variables hypothesized to be proximal to the primary endpoint. In this case, we aim to&#xD;
      demonstrate an effect for both interventions on the outcome of value-behavior consistency and&#xD;
      to determine effect sizes for estimating the sample size needed for a clinical trial.&#xD;

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Women referred for prenatal genetic counseling to consider invasive prenatal testing&#xD;
             who have not previously undergone prenatal testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Women who are ambivalent about undergoing prenatal testing. They will be screened for&#xD;
             ambivalence by answering no to a question about whether they have decided to undergo&#xD;
             prenatal testing and yes to a close-ended question about whether you have mixed or&#xD;
             conflicting feelings toward undergoing testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Women must be greater than or equal to 18 years old.&#xD;
