    <textblock>
      Background: Approximately 750,000 elderly Dutch people fall at least once a year, which often&#xD;
      results in physical injuries and a fear of falling, with high costs and far-reaching&#xD;
      consequences on functionality, physical activity, quality of life and mental well-being.&#xD;
      Falling is not only a burden for patients, it is also a burden for their caregivers.&#xD;
      Recurrent falling is a complex problem. However, the pathophysiological background of falls,&#xD;
      gait problems and dementia is largely unknown. The general pathophysiological hallmark of&#xD;
      aging is a liability in homeostatic mechanisms of organs. This liability results in an&#xD;
      impaired ability to adapt to stress and in increased biological variation in outcome measures&#xD;
      within individuals. In this study the investigators aim at developing an intervention to&#xD;
      reduce recurrent falling in frail elderly fallers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypotheses: The investigators hypothesize that the intervention program will decrease the&#xD;
      number of falls and fear of falling and increase mental well-being, physical activity and&#xD;
      functional performance in frail elderly people with a history of recurrent falling. In&#xD;
      addition, the burden on the caregivers will be reduced due to the intervention and will be&#xD;
      cost-effective. Furthermore, the investigators hypothesize that patients with a high&#xD;
      short-term intra-individual biological variability in gait and cognition variables have a&#xD;
      higher risk of falling, worse gait performance and cognitive decline after long term&#xD;
      follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design: Randomized, controlled, single-blind trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population: 160 patients referred to a geriatric outpatient clinic, who fell at least&#xD;
      once in the last 6 months and their primary caregivers (N=160).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention: A multifaceted fall prevention program for frail elders to reduce falls&#xD;
      incidence rate, consisting of physical and cognitive components. Moreover, it includes a&#xD;
      training program for caregivers in which they learn to support and give advice to the&#xD;
      patients, aiming to decrease the burden on the caregivers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Outcome Measures: The fall incidence rate is the primary outcome measure. Total&#xD;
      observation time of falls will be 6 months after the start of the intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Outcome Measures: In the patients, the secondary outcome measures are fear of&#xD;
      falling (FES), quality of life (MOS-20), depression and general anxiety, functional&#xD;
      performance in activities of daily living, physical activity, mobility, gait parameters, body&#xD;
      sway and biomarkers of endothelial function and frailty. For the caregiver, the secondary&#xD;
      outcome measures are caregiver's burden, mood and quality of life. In addition,&#xD;
      intraindividual variability of cognition, balance and gait in both patients and caregivers,&#xD;
      will be assessed and cost-effectiveness of the intervention will also be determined.&#xD;

      Nature and Extent of the Burden and Risks Associated with Participation, Benefit and Group&#xD;
      Relatedness: The outcome of this study may have important reflections on protocols to prevent&#xD;
      falling among elders and on health care decision makers to stimulate starting new fall&#xD;
      clinics and implement these protocols. Through this study, the well-being and functionality&#xD;
      of frail elders and their caregivers could be improved. As falling has an enormous economic&#xD;
      burden, a new effective fall prevention intervention could reduce health care costs&#xD;
      substantially. The tests consisting of questionnaires and gait and balance measurement are&#xD;
      non-invasive and safe. Taking blood samples is an invasive procedure, although no serious&#xD;
      adverse effects are expected. There are no foreseeable risks associated with participation in&#xD;
      this study. However, a burden will be placed on participating individuals because the&#xD;
      training sessions and measurements are time-consuming.&#xD;
