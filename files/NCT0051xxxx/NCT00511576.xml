  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test the combination of an experimental drug known as&#xD;
      MGCD0103 given along with an FDA-approved drug called docetaxel. This is a Phase 1 study that&#xD;
      will look at different doses of MGCD0103 given along with docetaxel in order to better&#xD;
      understand the effects (positive and negative) of this combination on the subject's body and&#xD;
      disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study would like to find the following information:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  How long MGCD0103 and docetaxel stay in the subject's body;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  What effects, good and/or bad, MGCD0103 and docetaxel have on the subject and on his/her&#xD;
           cancer; and&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If the genetic and chemical make-up of the subject's blood cells and tumor cells play a&#xD;
           role in how you respond or do not respond to MGCD0103 and docetaxel.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This Phase 1 study will evaluate escalating doses of orally administered MGCD0103 in&#xD;
      combination with two fixed doses (60 mg/m2 and 75 mg/m2) of IV docetaxel. In the US,&#xD;
      docetaxel is recommended at these or even higher doses (up to 100 mg/m2), both as a single&#xD;
      agent or in combination with other cytotoxic drugs (e.g., cisplatin, doxorubicin,&#xD;
      cyclophosphamide, and 5-fluorouracil), for the treatment of NSCLC, prostate cancer, gastric&#xD;
      adenocarcinoma, and head and neck cancer. In Japan, 60 mg/m2 IV docetaxel is the approved&#xD;
      dose for the treatment of breast cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MGCD0103 belongs to the class of more selective, less globally cytotoxic agents being&#xD;
      investigated for treatment of cancers today, and may offer a lesser and/or non-overlapping&#xD;
      toxicity profile than the cytotoxic agents with which docetaxel is currently combined.&#xD;
      MGCD0103 doses ranging from 50 to 135 mg have been administered in combination with the&#xD;
      approved regimen of azacitidine (Vidaza®) (75 mg/m2/day for 5 days every 4 weeks) to patients&#xD;
      with high-risk MDS and AML. A 50 mg dose of MGCD0103 has been administered in combination&#xD;
      with the approved regimen of gemcitabine (1000 mg/m2 once weekly for 3 consecutive weeks of&#xD;
      each 4-week cycle) to patients with advanced solid tumors; higher doses of MGCD0103 will soon&#xD;
      be evaluated in that trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Given the above, the proposed starting dose of 60 mg/m2 IV docetaxel and 50 mg MGCD0103 is&#xD;
      considered appropriately safe for initial investigation of this combination. Based on the&#xD;
      results observed in Part 1, the study may also evaluate 75 mg/m2 IV docetaxel and escalating&#xD;
      doses of orally administered MGCD0103 in Part 2 in order to determine whether this dosing&#xD;
      regimen is safe and would also warrant further investigation.&#xD;

    <description>Part 2 will begin once the MTD for MGCD0103 in combination with 60 mg/m2 IV docetaxel has been determined and further evaluated in the expansion phase. In Part 2, cohorts of three to six subjects will receive escalating doses of MGCD0103 administered orally TIW in combination with 75 mg/m2 docetaxel administered as a 1-hour IV infusion on Day 1 of each cycle. The starting dose of MGCD0103 administered in combination with 75 mg/m2 IV docetaxel will be the MTD from Part 1 minus 25 mg.</description>

    <description>In both Parts 1 and 2, subsequent doses of MGCD0103 will be escalated in 25 mg increments until the MTD of MGCD0103 in combination with each fixed dose (60 mg/m2 or 75 mg/m2) ofIV docetaxel is determined.&#xD;
In both parts 1 and 2, MGCD0103 will be administered orally TIW for 3 weeks beginning on Day 1 at 1 hour prior to the start of the IV docetaxel infusion.&#xD;
There will be no scheduled break between cycles and no limit to the number of cycles a subject can receive provided they do not have disease progression as defined by RECIST, or a clinically significant drug-related adverse event (AE) that does not resolve or respond to treatment intervention with 3 weeks.</description>
