      The specific primary aims of the study are to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Test the immediate effect of the intervention at 4-months on depression in urban African&#xD;
           American older adults (primary trial outcome; between group comparison). Hypothesis:&#xD;
           Participants in the intervention group will report fewer depressive symptoms in&#xD;
           comparison to control group participants receiving usual care.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Test the maintenance effect of the intervention at 8-months on depression (within group&#xD;
           comparison). Hypothesis: Participants in the intervention group will maintain reduced&#xD;
           symptom presentation from 4 to 8 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Evaluate acceptability (social validity) of the intervention and extent of engagement in&#xD;
           activities by study participants (both intervention and wait-list control subjects).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A secondary aim of this study is to assess the feasibility of conducting a clinical trial&#xD;
      embedded in a community service setting and its dissemination using a community-academic&#xD;
      partnership. We also propose three exploratory aims. First, we seek to evaluate the&#xD;
      mechanisms of action, or pathways, by which treatment gains are obtained (Gitlin et al.,&#xD;
      2000). Given that behavioral activation represents conceptually the key active ingredient of&#xD;
      the proposed intervention, we plan to evaluate its mediational effect. Second, we seek to&#xD;
      evaluate whether the intervention has a differential treatment effect based on a study&#xD;
      participant's gender, age, and living arrangement (alone or with others). Given that previous&#xD;
      research suggests that participant characteristics may moderate depressive symptoms and&#xD;
      treatment outcomes, these exploratory analyses will provide insight as to whether this&#xD;
      particular treatment benefits some groups more than others. Third, we seek to evaluate&#xD;
      whether the intervention has short and long-term effects on quality of life, functional&#xD;
      difficulty, and self-efficacy to manage day-to-day tasks. Previous research has shown that&#xD;
      depressive symptoms exacerbate functional decline such that minimizing distress may have the&#xD;
      added value of enhancing function and perceived efficacy for this group over time.&#xD;
