  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      High-dose vitamin A to children above 6 months of age reduces all-cause mortality by 23-30%.&#xD;
      The WHO recommends vitamin A supplementation (VAS) with the first vaccine after 6 months of&#xD;
      age. However, the effect of providing VAS with vaccines has never been investigated. We have&#xD;
      hypothesised that the effect of VAS depends on the immune stimulus at the time of&#xD;
      supplementation. Hence, the effect might vary depending on which type of vaccine it is given&#xD;
      with. In particular, we hypothesised that VAS might be beneficial when given with measles&#xD;
      vaccine but not when given with DTP vaccine. Normally the first vaccine after 6 months of age&#xD;
      would be a measles vaccine, but many children come late for their DTP vaccinations and&#xD;
      receive DTP alone or together with measles vaccine. Hence, it is important to study whether&#xD;
      the effect of VAS is the same irrespective of the vaccine(s) administered at the same time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Guinea-Bissau has not yet implemented the WHO vitamin A policy of providing VAS with&#xD;
      vaccines, but plans to do so within the next years. Together with the Ministry of Health in&#xD;
      Guinea-Bissau, the Bandim Health Project (BHP) in Guinea-Bissau will investigate the effect&#xD;
      on mortality and morbidity of implementing the WHO vitamin A policy in Guinea-Bissau. This&#xD;
      will be done in a large randomised trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      BHP has a demographic surveillance system (DSS) which has followed a population of now more&#xD;
      than 150,000 individuals for almost 30 years. Children will be randomised to receive VAS or&#xD;
      placebo with their first vaccine after 6 months of age, and will be followed through the DSS&#xD;
      to assess mortality and morbidity. Based on previous observations, the effects of VAS might&#xD;
      differ according to sex and season. The interaction between VAS, sex, and season will also be&#xD;
      studied in the present trial. By identifying situations where VAS may be beneficial,&#xD;
      ineffective, or even harmful the study may contribute importantly to optimising the VAS&#xD;
      policy for low-income countries.&#xD;
