      All of us have millions of bacteria living in our gut. These bacteria are very important to&#xD;
      our health providing us with protection against infections of the gut, allowing us to gain&#xD;
      extra nutritional value from food we eat and helping our immune system. Changes in the&#xD;
      balance of these many bacteria can make us vulnerable to infections both from within and from&#xD;
      outside the gut. Certain bacteria may also be directly associated with some diseases of the&#xD;
      gut. Research by doctors and scientists into relationships between the bacteria normally&#xD;
      found in our gut and certain diseases of the gut is helping to develop food supplements and&#xD;
      other therapies to treat these diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study involves research into the usefulness and safety of two probiotic products in&#xD;
      maintaining remission in Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. Approximately 360 patients&#xD;
      with Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis from Ireland, Finland and Spain will be involved&#xD;
      in the study. The yoghurts used in this study contain either Lactobacillus salivarius subsp.&#xD;
      salivarius or Bifidobacterium infantis.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There is a growing body of evidence that the enteric bacterial flora contribute to the&#xD;
      pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD; Crohn's disease and Ulcerative Colitis)&#xD;
      (Targan S and Shanahan F Inflammatory Bowel Disease: From Bench to Bedside, Williams and&#xD;
      Wilkins 1994).&#xD;
&#xD;
      It has recently been found that patients suffering active Crohn's disease have significantly&#xD;
      less recoverable bifidobacteria in their faeces compared to healthy individuals. This&#xD;
      reduction in bifidobacteria numbers was observed to be directly correlated with decreased&#xD;
      levels of B-D-galactosidase production and activity (Favier C et al. Dig Dis Sci&#xD;
      1997;42:817-822). B-D-galactosidase is an enzyme produced by bifidobacteria. These results&#xD;
      support suggestions proposed in other studies (Bartram HP et al. Am J Clin Nutr&#xD;
      1994;59:428-432) that strains of bifidobacteria may play important roles in maintaining a&#xD;
      balanced healthy intestinal microflora.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Crohn's disease, there is extensive clinical evidence indicating the importance of the&#xD;
      continuity of the faecal stream in disease recurrence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ingestion of bifidobacteria can improve gastrointestinal transit. In elderly individuals,&#xD;
      mild constipation can be at least partially corrected through the consumption of milk&#xD;
      fermented by bifidobacteria (Seki M et al. Nutr Food 1978;4:379-387). In addition, colonic&#xD;
      transit times of women were significantly accelerated in the sigmoid colon following&#xD;
      consumption of a milk fermented by bifidobacteria sp. and yoghurt cultures (Grimaud JC et al.&#xD;
      Gastroenterol Clin Biol 1993;17:A127), but not by traditional yoghurt cultures alone (Grimaud&#xD;
      JC et al. Les bact_ries lactiques, 1994;406).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several genetically engineered 'knock out' and transgenic animal models of IBD have been&#xD;
      reported in which the role of the enteric flora has been directly demonstrated by comparing&#xD;
      animals raised in germ free versus conventional facilities. For example, the gastrointestinal&#xD;
      Crohn's-like inflammation that occurs in interleukin-10 (IL-10) deficient mice is attenuated&#xD;
      when the animals are kept in a germ free environment and becomes more pronounced and&#xD;
      widespread when they are switched to conventional facilities. (Kuhn R et al. Cell&#xD;
      1993;75:263-274).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The mucosal inflammation in IL-10 deficient mice has been reported to be reduced by feeding&#xD;
      the animals a preparation of lactobacilli (Madsen K et al Gastroenterology 1997;112:A1030), a&#xD;
      result subsequently confirmed by a UCC-based research group who also reported that&#xD;
      consumption of Lactobacillus salivarius UCC118 reduced cancer incidence (O'Mahony et&#xD;
      al.2001).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Studies completed in rats have demonstrated that ingestion of bifidobacteria can suppress&#xD;
      aberrant crypt foci (early preneoplastic lesions) formation in the colon (Kulkarni N and&#xD;
      Reddy B. Proc Soc Experim Biol Med 1994;207:278-283) in addition to significant decreases in&#xD;
      colon tumor incidence and in the numbers of tumors present (Singh J et al. Carcinogenesis&#xD;
      1997;18:833-841).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background and Preliminary data:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several probiotic strains of lactic acid bacteria and Bifidobacterium probiotic strains have&#xD;
      been developed in UCC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lactobacillus salivarius UCC118 was chosen for its probiotic potential based on in vitro&#xD;
      activity against several pathogens and several other properties including acid/bile&#xD;
      tolerance. In addition, a preliminary trial, approved by the UCC Ethics Committee has already&#xD;
      been conducted in 80 human volunteers and has shown that either milk or yoghurt may be used&#xD;
      as a vehicle for delivery of Lactobacillus salivarius UCC118 to the gastrointestinal tract&#xD;
      with equal efficacy in altering gut flora and apparent colonisation. An abstract, based on&#xD;
      this study has been submitted to the American Gastroenterological Association and a full&#xD;
      manuscript has been submitted for publication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Furthermore, administration of Lactobacillus UCC118 to 20 patients with relapsed Crohn's&#xD;
      disease over a six week period resulted in reports that consumption of the probiotic improved&#xD;
      patient quality of life and, in fact, in most cases patients avoided the requirement for&#xD;
      steroid use (McCarthy et al., Submitted).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bifidobacterium infantis 35624 was chosen for its probiotic potential based on several&#xD;
      physiological properties including acid/bile tolerance. In addition, preliminary trials&#xD;
      completed by the UCC probiotic research group, in collaboration with UCLA School of Medicine&#xD;
      (Division of Digestive Diseases), have shown that Bifidobacterium infantis 35624 or a&#xD;
      combination of Lactobacillus salivarius UCC118 and Bifidobacterium infantis 35624 may prove&#xD;
      more effective in beneficially altering gut flora in an inflammatory disease mouse model and&#xD;
      of alleviating the symptoms of IBD in colonised mice. An abstract, based on this study has&#xD;
      been submitted to the American Gastroenterological Association and a full manuscript is in&#xD;
      preparation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary aim of the study is to determine whether ingestion of probiotic preparations&#xD;
      (containing Lactobacillus salivarius subsp. salivarius UCC118 or Bifidobacterium infantis&#xD;
      35624) can help in the maintenance of remission of patients with Crohn's disease and&#xD;
      ulcerative colitis over a period of one year (i.e., delay the onset of relapse).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary aims include an evaluation of the immunological and biochemical parameters of the&#xD;
      immuno-inflammatory response and an assessment of the faecal flora in patients consuming the&#xD;
      probiotic and control products.&#xD;
