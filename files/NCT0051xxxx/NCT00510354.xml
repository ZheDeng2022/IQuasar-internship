    <textblock>
      The purpose of this multicenter, single-arm, Simon two-stage, phase II trial is to determine&#xD;
      the efficacy and safety of everolimus in combination with Imatinib mesylate in patients with&#xD;
      previously treated, histologically proven GIST whose disease has recurred or progressed while&#xD;
      receiving 400 mg/day of Imatinib mesylate at any time during at least a 2 months' treatment&#xD;
      period.&#xD;

        Inclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Histological proven diagnosis of GIST&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Objectively documented evidence of progressive disease according to the RECIST&#xD;
             criteria despite at least 2 months' continuous treatment with Imatinib mesylate at a&#xD;
             dosage of 400 mg/day&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Clinical evidence of resistance to Imatinib mesylate on treatment with 400 mg/day&#xD;
             Imatinib&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Progression must be documented on CT or MRI scans. The scans on which progression is&#xD;
             documented should be at maximum 2 weeks old. New scans are only required as baseline&#xD;
             scans if they are older then approx. 2 weeks&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. At least one measurable lesion (longest diameter ≥ 20 mm on conventional CT or MRI&#xD;
             scan; ≥ 10 mm on spiral CT)&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance Status 0-2&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Adequate bone marrow, liver and renal function on Imatinib treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Patients must be at least 4 weeks since prior major surgery and recovered, at least 2&#xD;
             weeks since prior minor surgery and recovered&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Female patients who are pregnant or breast feeding, or patients of reproductive&#xD;
             potential not employing an effective method of birth control. Because oral,&#xD;
             implantable or injectable contraceptives may be affected by cytochrome P450&#xD;
             interactions, an appropriate method of birth control should be used throughout the&#xD;
             trial in both sexes. Women of childbearing potential must have a negative serum&#xD;
             pregnancy test ≤ 48 hours prior to the administration of study medication&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Patients presenting with known or symptomatic CNS metastases or leptomeningeal&#xD;
             involvement&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Use of other investigational cancer therapies within 28 days prior to enrollment or&#xD;
             which are currently being or planned to be received during the course of the study&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Patients who previously received rapamycin in combination with Imatinib&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Patients with any concurrent major medical condition liable to compromise the&#xD;
             patient's participation in the study (e.g. known HIV infection, uncontrolled diabetes,&#xD;
             serious cardiac dysrhythmia or condition, New York Heart Association classification of&#xD;
             III or IV, congestive cardiac failure, myocardial infarction within 6 months, unstable&#xD;
             angina, chronic or acute renal or liver disease, uncontrolled infections including&#xD;
             abscess or fistulae, etc.)&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Patients with a history of another malignancy within 5 years prior to study entry,&#xD;
             except curatively treated non-melanotic skin cancer or in-situ cervical cancer&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Patients receiving glucocorticoids (only if the p70s6 kinase-1 assay is being&#xD;
             performed), since glucocorticoids have been shown to inhibit p70s6 kinase-1 activity&#xD;
&#xD;
        Other protocol defined inclusion/ exclusion criteria may apply&#xD;
