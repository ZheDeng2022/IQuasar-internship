      We hypothesize that micronutrient fortified probiotic yogurt can improve nutritional status&#xD;
      and enhance immunity parameters in subjects HIV/AIDS and other immunodeficiencies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We have developed a micronutrient-fortified probiotic yogurt that has safe and beneficial&#xD;
      levels of micronutrients for human consumption. This has been undertaken with the guidance of&#xD;
      Edward Farnworth, a senior research scientist at Agri-Food Canada-Food Research and&#xD;
      Development Centre, St. Hyacinthe, Quebec&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will now measure nutritional parameters (height, weight, serum albumin, serum nutrient&#xD;
      levels, blood urea, liver function tests (AST, ALT)) to determine if there is a statistically&#xD;
      significant difference between the various levels of fortified probiotic yogurt and the&#xD;
      placebo on the nutritional parameters of the subjects consuming the yogurt.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will measure immunological parameters (CD4 lymphocyte count, CBC, levels of TNFα, IL-12,&#xD;
      IL-10, and G-CSF [Kim, et.al. 2006]) in order to determine if there is a statistically&#xD;
      significant difference using fortified probiotic yogurt compared to a placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, we will determine if the micronutrient-fortified probiotic yogurt has a&#xD;
      significant impact on the overall quality of life for the subjects using the &quot;linear analogue&#xD;
      self assessment&quot; tool [Kaiser, et.al 2006].&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Drs. Reid and Hekmat have recently developed a fermented milk product (yogurt) containing&#xD;
      Lactobacillus GR-1 and RC-14 and concluded that such dairy products are suitable vehicles for&#xD;
      these beneficial microorganisms [Hekmat, S. &amp; Reid, G. 2006].&#xD;
&#xD;
      The strains Lactobacillus rhamnosus GR-1 and Lactobacillus reuteri RC-14 have a proven&#xD;
      efficacy to treat and protect against gastrointestinal and urogenital infections [Anukam, K.&#xD;
      et. al. 2006; 2007]. In one study, the supplementation of yogurt with these probiotics was&#xD;
      shown to eradicate diahrea and increase the CD4 T-lymphocyte counts in HIV subjects [Anukam,&#xD;
      K. et.al. 2006]. HIV infected subjects often suffer diarrheal episodes, and consequently&#xD;
      experience malabsorption of certain nutrients [Cunningham-Rundles, 2000]. A study conducted&#xD;
      by Cunningham et. al [2000] found that probiotic Lactobacillus plantarum 299 had a positive&#xD;
      impact on the immunity of 10/17 children and on the growth of all of the children who were&#xD;
      HIV-positive.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is estimated that 75 percent of immune function is localized in the gastrointestinal&#xD;
      tract, which may explain why oral administration of probiotics is an excellent tool for&#xD;
      immunomodulation [Olah, A. et. al. 2002]. In a study of 45 patients with acute pancreatitis,&#xD;
      22 were given probiotic Lactobacillus plantarum 299 and 10g of oat fibre with regular enteral&#xD;
      nutrition; and 23 were given a placebo in the form of regular enteral nutrition.&#xD;
      Significantly fewer (n=1 versus n=7) patients in the probiotic/fibre group experienced septic&#xD;
      complications requiring surgery, highlighting the safety and potential hospitalized benefits&#xD;
      that could be accrued for critical care nutrition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A study has recently shown in 40 HIV-infected patients taking a stavudine and/or&#xD;
      didanosine-based HAART regimen plus micronutrients twice daily for twelve weeks, that the&#xD;
      absolute CD4 count increased by an average of 24% versus 0% in the placebo group (p=0.01).&#xD;
      The mean HIV-1 RNA decreased in the micronutrient supplementation group [Kaiser, et.al.&#xD;
      2006]. This is significant for the HIV/AIDS pandemic in Africa and for the many people in&#xD;
      Canada living with HIV/AIDS. In addition, this may be related to other immunodeficiencies in&#xD;
      hospitalized patients from chemotherapeutic and radiological treatments, organ&#xD;
      transplantation, controlling diabetes, and other chronic ailments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical malnutrition is a heterogenous group of disorders including macronutrient&#xD;
      deficiencies that lead to body cell mass depletion and micronutrient deficiencies, and these&#xD;
      often coexist with infectious and inflammatory processes [Hughes,S. &amp; Kelly, P. 2006].&#xD;
      Diverse factors affect bioavailability, such as the nutritional status of individuals, the&#xD;
      presence in the diet of substances which facilitate or inhibit its absorption, interactions&#xD;
      among micronutrients, illnesses, and chemical characteristics of the compound used for&#xD;
      fortification. There is good evidence that specific micronutrients, particularly zinc and&#xD;
      vitamin A, influence immunity, while iron supplementation is often not effective in Africa&#xD;
      [Hughes, S. &amp; Kelly, P. 2006].&#xD;
&#xD;
      More than 20% of older adults may have marginal or frank vitamin B12 deficiency [Park, et.al.&#xD;
      2006], while folic acid is often deficient in children and reproductive aged females.&#xD;
      Glutamine, arginine, fatty acids, and vitamin E provide additional benefits to&#xD;
      immunocompromised persons or patients who suffer from various infections, while long-chain&#xD;
      polyunsaturated n-3 fatty acids, vitamin E, vitamin C, selenium, and nucleotides can modulate&#xD;
      immunity to fight infection [Field, et.al. 2002]. In order to produce energy, the use of&#xD;
      glucose by nervous tissue requires vitamin B1; this vitamin modulates cognitive performance,&#xD;
      especially in the elderly. Vitamin B9 preserves brain during its development and memory&#xD;
      during ageing. Vitamin B6 is likely to benefit in treating premenstrual depression. Vitamins&#xD;
      B6 and B12, among others, are directly involved in the synthesis of some neurotransmitters&#xD;
      [Bourre, JM. 2006]. Thus, three formulations added to L. rhamnosus GR-2 supplemented yogurt,&#xD;
      will be tested at the Brescia College Tasting Centre where volunteers will score the products&#xD;
      for taste and texture [Hekmat, S. &amp; Reid, G. 2006]&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thirty test subjects will be recruited during the first four months of the study, for&#xD;
      inclusion in a trial starting at the 4-6 month time-point, with completion by 10-12 months. A&#xD;
      crossover study will be performed in London in which 10 HIV positive volunteers with CD4&#xD;
      counts between 200 and 400 on their standard treatment (including Highly Active&#xD;
      Antiretroviral Therapy), and 10 subjects with Cancer who are in the recovery stages and not&#xD;
      currently receiving chemotherapy or radiation therapy, and 10 healthy adults (aged 18-30)&#xD;
      will randomly be assigned to receive one cup of Yogurts 1, 2 or 3 and a control&#xD;
      unsupplemented yogurt 4, daily for one month, followed by a two week washout where no yogurt&#xD;
      will be consumed, then one month on the second yogurt, two weeks off etc for 162 days.&#xD;
      Subjects will not be receiving antibiotics, not have any mental illness that would affect&#xD;
      compliance, or not be requiring surgery during the study. No restrictions will be placed on&#xD;
      subjects continuing prescribed or other remedies, but none will consume any other probiotic&#xD;
      product during the study. The volunteers will be gender matched and a randomization scheme&#xD;
      will ensure that subjects are blinded and different yogurts are distributed at each time&#xD;
      (thus, for example two subjects will receive yogurt 1, two yogurt 2, three yogurt 3 and three&#xD;
      yogurt 4 on day sample day one). The two week washout period will be used, as probiotic&#xD;
      organisms do not persist for longer than that. Various measurements will be taken on the day&#xD;
      of consuming the first and last batches of yogurt (days 0, 30, 44, 74, 88, 118, 132, 162).&#xD;
      These will include weight, height, and from blood samples the CD4 count, CBC, levels of TNFα,&#xD;
      IL-12, IL-10 and G-CSF [Kim, et.al. 2006], liver function test (AST, ALT), serum albumin,&#xD;
      total protein, blood urea, serum zinc levels, serum selenium levels and HIV-1 RNA. A linear&#xD;
      analogue self-assessment tool will be used to assess the subject's energy levels, daily&#xD;
      activities and overall quality of life [Kaiser, et.al. 2006].&#xD;
&#xD;
      The present project is an important step in developing new yogurts, supplemented with&#xD;
      micronutrients and probiotic lactobacilli for malnourished children, adults, and seniors in&#xD;
      Canada, as well as surgical, transplant, and hospitalized patients, and HIV/AIDS subjects in&#xD;
      Canada and in Africa. The following formulations will be used to supplement the yogurt:&#xD;
