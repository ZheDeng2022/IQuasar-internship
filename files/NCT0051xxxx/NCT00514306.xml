    <textblock>
      Multicenter, open-label, phase 1, cohort dose escalation study to determine the maximum&#xD;
      tolerated dose (MTD) of 3 intermittent OSI-906 dosing schedules.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Multicenter, open-label, phase 1, cohort dose escalation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will open with Dosing Schedule 1 (S1) (OSI-906 Once Daily (QD) Days 1-3 every 14&#xD;
      days). Dosing Schedule 2 (S2) (OSI-906 QD Days 1-5 every 14 days) will be initiated following&#xD;
      observation of clinically significant related toxicity ≥ grade 2 in S1 or after a review of&#xD;
      preliminary safety and pharmacokinetic data from ≥ 6 dose levels in S1 indicate that toxicity&#xD;
      is acceptable and potential improvement in exposure may be achieved by an increased number of&#xD;
      dosing days. Dosing Schedule 3 (S3) (OSI-906 QD Days 1-7 every 14 days) will occur upon&#xD;
      observation of clinically significant related toxicity ≥ grade 2 in S2 or after ≥ 1 dose&#xD;
      level in S2 has been examined.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A 3-patient bridging dose cohort will be opened in S1 to qualitatively compare the 25 mg&#xD;
      capsule with 100 mg capsule dosage strengths in order to confirm that no gross differences in&#xD;
      safety or exposure exist between the formulations. In order to characterize the tablet, a&#xD;
      6-patient dose cohort will be opened to qualitatively examine the pharmacokinetics of this&#xD;
      dosage form.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once the MTD has been determined for S1 and once the safety and pharmacokinetic data from the&#xD;
      tablet cohort have been reviewed, a Fed-Fasted Expansion Cohort will be opened.&#xD;
