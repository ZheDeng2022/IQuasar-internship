      Several subjects enrolled in a multi-site, gene transfer clinical study to evaluate the&#xD;
      intrahepatic administration of AAV2-hFIX16 vector for the treatment of severe hemophilia B&#xD;
      between 2001 and 2009. As the US FDA has established guidelines for the long-term follow-up&#xD;
      (LTFU) of subjects receiving investigational gene therapy products, this protocol seeks to&#xD;
      characterize the clinical outcome and the type and seriousness of adverse events following&#xD;
      the AAV gene transfer. The primary study tools will consist of annual history/physical&#xD;
      examination and blood tests, as well as periodic liver ultrasound, to characterize clinical&#xD;
      outcomes. Where possible, data will be obtained for up to 15 years following hepatic&#xD;
      AAV2-hFIX16 gene transfer.&#xD;

      A prior clinical gene transfer study of intrahepatic adeno-associated virus (AAV) vector&#xD;
      administration of the factor IX gene (AAV2-hFIX16) to adult subjects with severe hemophilia B&#xD;
      enrolled several subjects from 2001 through 2004. These subjects received various doses of&#xD;
      AAV2-hFIX16 manufactured by Avigen, Inc. (Alameda, CA). They were monitored up to at least&#xD;
      one year following vector administration for evaluation of adverse events and for indices of&#xD;
      efficacy. At the time study enrollment was suspended by Avigen, Inc., and IND 9398 under&#xD;
      which the study was conducted was transferred to The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia (May&#xD;
      2005), there were no guidelines for long-term follow-up of the trial subjects. However, in an&#xD;
      unrelated study conducted in France, of pediatric subjects administered integrating&#xD;
      retrovirus vectors for X-linked severe combined immune deficiency (X-SCID), several leukemias&#xD;
      developed years after transfer of the γc common chain gene. The underlying mechanism was&#xD;
      attributed to proviral integration near, and upregulation of, proto-oncogenes such as LMO-2,&#xD;
      coupled with robust expression of the γc common chain, inducing unregulated cellular&#xD;
      proliferation. In response to these events, and in concert with the NIH and gene transfer&#xD;
      scientific community, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (US FDA) issued guidelines for&#xD;
      the 'long-term follow-up of gene transfer subjects'. Since AAV vectors have a low rate of&#xD;
      genomic integration, the risks of integration are low, but the long-term effect of the&#xD;
      persistence of vector particles in humans is unknown. The investigators plan to enroll&#xD;
      available subjects from the prior intrahepatic AAV gene transfer study to this observational&#xD;
      study to follow them for up to 15 years after gene transfer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An additional subject received AAV2-hFIX16 vector, manufactured by CCMT at CHOP, via hepatic&#xD;
      artery infusion in January 2009. The study AAV2-hFIX-002, an amendment to the prior Avigen,&#xD;
      Inc. clinical protocol modified to include transient immunomodulation, was conducted under&#xD;
      IND 9398. This subject was monitored for three years following vector administration under&#xD;
      clinical study AAV2-hFIX-002; amendment one of the current protocol transfers his annual&#xD;
      long-term follow-up visits to AAV2-hFIX16-LTFU-01.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Spark Therapeutics will be the study sponsor; prior vector administration sites or&#xD;
      referral/follow up sites will participate as study sites. The long-term follow-up (LTFU)&#xD;
      study will consist primarily of endpoints including annual history, physical examination,&#xD;
      blood tests, urinalysis, and periodic liver ultrasound. Adverse event reporting will focus on&#xD;
      the development of oncologic, hematologic, neurologic and auto-immune events following gene&#xD;
      transfer as specified in the November 2006 FDA Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research&#xD;
      (CBER) guidance document entitled, &quot;Gene Therapy Clinical Trials - Observing Subjects for&#xD;
      Delayed Adverse Events.&quot;1 The LTFU study seeks to provide longitudinal information, and&#xD;
      should adverse events occur, more timely discovery and treatment.&#xD;
