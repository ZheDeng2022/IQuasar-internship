  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Over the past decade, avian influenza (AI) has become a major health concern. The development&#xD;
      of safe and effective vaccines against avian strains infecting people is important. The&#xD;
      purpose of this study is to determine the safety of and immune response to a new AI vaccine&#xD;
      in healthy adults against the H7N3 strain of avian influenza.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The current pandemic risk associated with avian influenza H7N3 infection is significant as an&#xD;
      increasing number of humans are infected. H7 influenza transmission usually occurs in humans&#xD;
      when they are exposed through direct contact to infected poultry or surfaces and objects&#xD;
      contaminated by infected poultry feces. A pandemic occurs when a new influenza subtype&#xD;
      emerges that infects humans, causes serious illness, and spreads easily between humans. The&#xD;
      development of a safe and effective vaccine is necessary, should a pandemic occur. The&#xD;
      purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of a live, attenuated AI&#xD;
      virus vaccine, H7N3 (6-2) AA ca Recombinant (A/chicken/British Columbia/CN-6/2004 x A/Ann&#xD;
      Arbor/6/60 ca).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will last approximately 90 days. Participation in this study includes two 12-day&#xD;
      hospital stays in an isolation unit at the Johns Hopkins Bayview Medical Center. All&#xD;
      participants will receive two doses of vaccine in nasal spray form, at study entry and&#xD;
      sometime between 4 and 8 weeks after initial vaccination. Participants will be admitted to&#xD;
      the isolation unit 2 days prior to each vaccination. A targeted physical exam, vital signs&#xD;
      measurement, and a nasal wash will occur daily following each vaccination until discharge.&#xD;
      Participants will be discharged after three consecutive nasal washes on or after Day 6 are&#xD;
      negative. Blood and urine collection will occur at selected timepoints throughout the study.&#xD;
      A follow-up outpatient visit will occur approximately 4 weeks following each vaccination.&#xD;
