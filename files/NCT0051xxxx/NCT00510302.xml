      Primary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To conduct semi-structured interviews with melanoma patients and family members to&#xD;
           collect descriptive information on their UVR exposure, UVR exposure-reduction practices,&#xD;
           melanoma early detection practices, knowledge, psychosocial variables related to&#xD;
           melanoma risk-reduction (e.g., self-efficacy, norms, and expectations), and experiences&#xD;
           surrounding the diagnosis of melanoma in the family. Melanoma patients and family&#xD;
           members with children will be asked about the UVR exposure and UVR exposure-reduction&#xD;
           practices of their children, and parental practices to reduce UVR exposure among&#xD;
           children.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To develop behavioral and attitudinal questionnaires based on data collected during&#xD;
           semi-structured interviews, and evaluate the appropriateness of these questionnaires&#xD;
           using cognitive interviewing techniques.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To develop tailored messages aimed at promoting strategies to reduce UVR exposure (e.g.,&#xD;
           wearing protective clothing, minimizing midday UVR exposure, minimizing duration of UVR&#xD;
           exposure, using shade and sunscreen, avoiding sun lamps, and avoiding intentional&#xD;
           tanning) and improving adherence to surveillance and screening guidelines. Messages will&#xD;
           be developed to correspond to responses to questionnaire items.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess tailored messages for their relevance, appropriateness, attractiveness and&#xD;
           appeal, credibility, and perceived behavioral impact among melanoma patients and their&#xD;
           family members.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Participants in Part 1 of the study will be asked to be interviewed about topics related to&#xD;
      melanoma risk-reduction, including opinions, attitudes, beliefs, and practices related to&#xD;
      ultraviolet radiation exposure, melanoma prevention, and melanoma detection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants in Part 2 of the study will be asked to complete a written questionnaire on&#xD;
      melanoma risk-reduction and then be interviewed to obtain feedback on how the questionnaire&#xD;
      may be refined.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants in Part 3 of the study will be asked to be interviewed by telephone.&#xD;
      Participants then will receive educational material in the form of a newsletter tailored to&#xD;
      their interview responses. Participants then will be asked to be interviewed to obtain&#xD;
      feedback for refining the educational material. In each part of the study, the patient/family&#xD;
      member will receive a letter describing the study and the Consent Statement for Questionnaire&#xD;
      and Interview Studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior to the start of the interview, the Consent Statement will be read to the patient/family&#xD;
      member. Patients/family members may or may not choose to have the interview tape-recorded.&#xD;
      Participants may stop the interview or questionnaire at any time and may refuse to answer any&#xD;
      questions. At any time, the patient/family member may refuse to have the interview&#xD;
      tape-recorded. There is no treatment associated with this study.&#xD;
