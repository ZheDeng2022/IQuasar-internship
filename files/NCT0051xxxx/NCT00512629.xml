  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Parenteral nutrition (PN) solutions are life saving in patients with surgical&#xD;
      gastrointestinal diseases. However, the use of PN in pediatric populations, especially&#xD;
      premature infants, is frequently associated with liver injury that may ultimately result in&#xD;
      hepatic failure. In studies conducted in a murine model, we observed that intravenous fat&#xD;
      emulsions (IFE) comprised of omega-3 fatty acids were able to prevent the development of&#xD;
      cholestasis, a common precursor of PN-associated liver disease, as well as reverse&#xD;
      preexisting PNALD through a combination of factors, including improved triglyceride clearance&#xD;
      coupled with anti-inflammatory properties. In a case series treating patients with hepatic&#xD;
      cholestasis, serum bilirubin levels decreased markedly after the parenteral administration of&#xD;
      an omega-3 fatty acid based fat emulsion (Omegaven®). Patients tolerated this therapy and no&#xD;
      adverse reactions attributed to its use were observed. Based on results of these previous&#xD;
      studies, we propose to conduct a randomized trial aiming to gain preliminary evidence of&#xD;
      efficacy of an omega-3 fatty acid based IFE in preventing PNALD in children with intestinal&#xD;
      failure&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      We propose to conduct a randomized controlled clinical trial to determine whether the use of&#xD;
      an omega-3 fatty acid based IFE in infants with surgical gastrointestinal disease will&#xD;
      improve clinical outcomes compared to infants treated with standard IFE up to 6 months post&#xD;
      randomization. Neonates and infants &lt; 3 months old (postnatally) with surgical&#xD;
      gastrointestinal disease (defined as congenital or acquired gastrointestinal disease&#xD;
      requiring PN for more than 21 days) will be eligible for enrollment. Patients who meet all&#xD;
      inclusion and exclusion criteria will be randomized to receive PN with either Intralipid® or&#xD;
      Omegaven®. The appearance of both IFEs is indistinguishable, so patients, families and the&#xD;
      medical care team will be blinded to treatment group allocation. Aside from the IFE type, the&#xD;
      clinical care of both groups of infants will remain unchanged, including standard use of&#xD;
      feeding advancement protocols, and treatment of underlying gastrointestinal and other&#xD;
      diseases.&#xD;

    <description>The definition of &quot;Presence vs. Absence of PNAC&quot; will vary with the post conceptual age of the child. In infants &gt; 40 weeks post conceptual age, we will define PN-associated cholestasis as four consecutive measurements (&gt; 6 days apart) of serum direct bilirubin &gt; 2.0mg/dL obtained over a 30 day period in the absence of other demonstrable etiologies of cholestasis. Due to hepatic immaturity, for infants &lt; 40 weeks post conceptual age, PN associated cholestasis will be defined as four consecutive measurements (&gt; 6 days apart) of serum direct bilirubin &gt; 2.0mg/dL obtained over a 42 day period.</description>
