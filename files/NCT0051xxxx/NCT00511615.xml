      The hypothesis of this research project is that topical application of the anti-EGFR or&#xD;
      anti-E6/E7 contrast agents followed by optical imaging will yield images that reflect spatial&#xD;
      variations in expression that correlate with the presence of cervical precancer. To gather&#xD;
      feasibility data the investigators will:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Obtain cervical specimens from women with high grade squamous intraepithelial lesions&#xD;
           (HGSILs) being treated with the loop electrosurgical excision procedure (LEEP).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. After Loop Electrosurgical Excision Procedure (LEEP) is performed, obtain low and high&#xD;
           resolution optical images before and after applying contrast agents topically to the&#xD;
           epithelial surface of the tissue for 30 minutes before rinsing.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Submit the specimen for histology, and have it sectioned and stained using both H&amp;E and&#xD;
           immunohistochemical staining for EGFR or E6/E7. The images will be reconstructed into a&#xD;
           two dimensional map delineating areas of Cervical Intraepithelial Neoplasia (CIN) and of&#xD;
           EGFR or E6/E7 overexpression. Maps of the pathology will be compared to those obtained&#xD;
           from the intact cervix exposed to the contrast agent.&#xD;

      During your scheduled colposcopy, a sample of tissue will be removed from your cervix using&#xD;
      the loop electrosurgical excision procedure (LEEP). The LEEP is the standard of care&#xD;
      treatment for the precancerous condition on your cervix. The details of the procedure will be&#xD;
      covered in another consent form. Before the LEEP, a photograph will be taken of the cervix.&#xD;
      This photograph will be taken for research purposes, so that researchers will have a&#xD;
      photograph to compare to the images taken with the MDC and Confocal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The tissue that is removed will be taken to a room where the researchers will use a special&#xD;
      microscope to look at the tissue before and after the new contrast agent is painted on the&#xD;
      surface of the tissue. After the tissue samples are looked at, they will be sent to the lab&#xD;
      for routine tests (as part of your standard of care).&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will require a LEEP whether you participate in this study or not. The tissue removal is a&#xD;
      standard part of the LEEP. The experimental portion of this study is the use of the contrast&#xD;
      agent. Once that portion is complete, the tissue will be tested as per standard of care. The&#xD;
      tissue will not be used for any other research testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will not be told of any of the experimental findings with the contrast agent. However,&#xD;
      your doctor and/or nurse practitioner will be told the results of the routine tests, and they&#xD;
      will give these results to you.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an investigational study. The LEEP is considered standard of care and any charges&#xD;
      associated with the LEEP will be the responsibility of you and/or your insurance provider. Up&#xD;
      to 80 women will take part in this multicenter study. Up to 40 will be enrolled at M.D.&#xD;
      Anderson.&#xD;
