      This study will test the effectiveness of two different kinds of omega-3 fatty acid dietary&#xD;
      supplements in treating the symptoms of major depression.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Major depression is a common mental disorder that affects millions of people each year. It&#xD;
      can severely impact a person's life, causing someone to often feel sad and hopeless, as well&#xD;
      as affect a person's sleep patterns, concentration, and energy levels. Despite the&#xD;
      availability of numerous therapies, current treatments are not ideal for some people.&#xD;
      Recently, some research has shown that an increase in dietary intake of polyunsaturated fatty&#xD;
      acids (PUFAs), such as omega-3 fatty acid, might help treat depression. Eicosapentanoic acid&#xD;
      (EPA) and docosahexanoic acid (DHA) are two common types of PUFAs high in omega-3 fatty acids&#xD;
      and are available in low dosages in some dietary supplements. The purpose of this study is to&#xD;
      compare the effectiveness of an EPA-enriched mixture versus pure DHA versus a placebo in&#xD;
      treating the symptoms of major depression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants in this double blind study will be randomly assigned to one of three study&#xD;
      groups. Participants assigned to the first study group will receive capsules containing 500&#xD;
      mg of an EPA-enriched omega-3 fatty acid preparation. Participants assigned to the second&#xD;
      study group will receive capsules containing 500 mg of pure DHA. Participants assigned to the&#xD;
      third study group will receive capsules containing a placebo. The study will last&#xD;
      approximately 9 weeks. This will include an initial screening the first week followed by an&#xD;
      8-week period during which all participants will take two capsules of their assigned&#xD;
      treatment each morning. Participants will attend a total of six study visits. The initial&#xD;
      visit will last approximately 2 hours and will include a psychiatric assessment, urine and&#xD;
      blood collection, an electrocardiogram (EKG), and a Food Processor Questionnaire.&#xD;
      Participants who qualify for further participation will then enter a 1-week washout period&#xD;
      during which they will stop taking any current psychotropic medication. At the second study&#xD;
      visit, participants will be assigned to their treatment group. Upon starting assigned&#xD;
      treatments, participants will then return for study visits every 2 weeks to report any&#xD;
      possible side effects and to complete standard psychiatric assessment tests. All of these&#xD;
      study visits will take approximately 1 hour, except the last, which will take 2 hours. In&#xD;
      addition to the psychiatric assessment and review of side effects, the final study visit will&#xD;
      also include a physical exam and blood collection.&#xD;
