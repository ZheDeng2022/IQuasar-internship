    <textblock>
      Due to arguments showing that angiogenesis could be involved in progression of metastatic&#xD;
      thyroid carcinoma and to objective response during previous studies with sunitinib (an&#xD;
      angiogenic oncology drug also known as Sutent), this study, THYSU, is justified to evaluate&#xD;
      the efficacy of sunitinib in metastatic thyroid carcinoma. Furthermore, the standard&#xD;
      treatment of metastatic thyroid carcinoma when a general treatment is to be prescribed is&#xD;
      limited to radioiodine. When radioiodine becomes ineffective, there is no standard treatment&#xD;
      despite some use of chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of the trial is to determine the objective tumor response rate (efficacy) in&#xD;
      patients with locally advanced or metastatic anaplastic, differentiated or medullary thyroid&#xD;
      carcinoma treated with sunitinib; a secondary objective is to evaluate the safety of&#xD;
      sunitinib in these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The THYSU trial is a phase II, French multi-center study. This trial's plan is to enroll 75&#xD;
      patients with locally advanced or metastatic anaplastic, differentiated or medullar thyroid&#xD;
      carcinoma.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The THYSU trial is a phase II trial of sunitinib (Sutent) in patients with locally advanced&#xD;
      or metastatic anaplastic, differentiated or medullary thyroid carcinoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Due to arguments showing that angiogenesis could be involved in progression of metastatic&#xD;
      thyroid carcinoma and to objective response during a phase I trial with sunitinib, it was&#xD;
      justified to evaluate in a prospective trial the efficacy of sunitinib in metastatic thyroid&#xD;
      carcinoma. Furthermore, the standard treatment of metastatic thyroid carcinoma when a general&#xD;
      treatment is to be prescribed is limited to radioiodine. When radioiodine becomes&#xD;
      ineffective, there is no standard treatment despite some usage of chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of the trial is to determine the objective tumor response rate in patients with&#xD;
      locally advanced or metastatic anaplastic, differentiated or medullary thyroid carcinoma&#xD;
      treated with sunitinib, a secondary objective is to evaluate the safety of sunitinib in these&#xD;
      patients with thyroid carcinoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The treatment of sunitinib is the standard dosage and schedule. Sunitinib is given orally at&#xD;
      the dose of 50 mg daily for 28 days followed by 2 weeks of rest. Forthcoming cycles remain&#xD;
      identical. Modification of the dose may use a lower dose at 37.5 mg or 25 mg given daily on&#xD;
      the same schedule. All patients will receive repeated cycles of treatment until disease&#xD;
      progression, occurrence of unacceptable toxicity, withdrawal of patient consent, or other&#xD;
      withdrawal criteria are met. After discontinuation of treatment and the mandated 28-day&#xD;
      follow up, patients will be followed only in order to collect information on further&#xD;
      antineoplastic therapy and survival. In patients discontinuing treatment for reasons other&#xD;
      than disease progression, tumor assessment will continue until disease progression, or&#xD;
      initiation of other antineoplastic therapies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The more frequent side effects are asthenia, mucositis, arterial hypertension, hand foot&#xD;
      syndrome and diarrhea. Other side effects have been reported including nausea, vomiting,&#xD;
      cutaneous events, decrease in left ventricular ejection fraction, neutropenia, and&#xD;
      thrombopenia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients must meet all of the following inclusion criteria to be eligible for enrollment&#xD;
      into the trial:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients must sign and date IRB/EC-approved informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Age ≥ 18.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients must have a life expectancy of at least 3 months and Karnofsky performance&#xD;
           status ≥ 70%&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients must have histologically confirmed TC&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Tumor disease must be progressive (evidence of disease progression within 6 months)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients should not be candidates for surgical resection, external beam radiotherapy or&#xD;
           radioiodine, and patients must not have more than one previous systemic treatment for&#xD;
           cancer&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients must have measurable disease defined by RECIST criteria as at least one lesion&#xD;
           at least 2 cm in length by conventional CT techniques or at least 1 cm by spiral CT&#xD;
           scan.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Resolution of all acute toxic effects of any prior treatment to NCI - CTCAE (version&#xD;
           3.0) grade &lt; 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients must have discontinued from radiation therapy at least 4 weeks before first&#xD;
           dose of study treatment and must have recovered from any toxic effects of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood pressure &lt; 140 / 90 mmHg&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients must have adequate organ function.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients with reproductive potential must use medically acceptable contraceptive method.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Willingness and ability to comply with the study procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patient affiliated with or profiting from a social security system&#xD;
&#xD;
      The presence of any non-inclusion criteria will exclude a patient from study enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior to undergoing any specific study procedures, patient and investigator sign informed&#xD;
      consent. During the initial visit including verification of eligibility criteria, an&#xD;
      interview with the patient is conducted regarding his/her recent and past clinical and&#xD;
      treatment history (including oncology history). Physical examination including examination of&#xD;
      major body systems, Karnofsky performance status, body weight, height, and vital signs is&#xD;
      performed. Laboratory data are collected (hematology and chemistry, coagulation, thyroid&#xD;
      tests, tumor markers and pregnancy test if applicable). Para clinic evaluations (12-lead ECGs&#xD;
      and tumor imaging) are carried out. LVEF assessed by Echocardiogram or by MUGA scan (if&#xD;
      necessary) and Brain Naturatic Peptide (Or NT pro-BNP) test are done.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the follow-up, the patients are followed between the end of week 4 and week 6 by&#xD;
      clinical and biological evaluation. Evaluation of tumor sites under sunitinib is planned&#xD;
      every 2 cycles with CT scans. For patients with anaplastic or differentiated thyroid&#xD;
      carcinoma, the first stage will include 21 efficacy-evaluable patients. An additional 29&#xD;
      efficacy-evaluable patients will be included at the second stage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For patients with medullary thyroid carcinoma, the first stage will include 11&#xD;
      efficacy-evaluable patients. An additional 7 to 14 efficacy-evaluable patients will be&#xD;
      included at the second stage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      10 French Oncology Departments are involved in this trial.&#xD;
