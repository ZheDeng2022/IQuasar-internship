        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients will meet DSM-IV-TR criteria for BED for at least the last 6 months,&#xD;
             determined by the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV-TR (SCID) (72) and&#xD;
             supported by the Eating Disorder Examination (EDE) (73). These criteria are as&#xD;
             follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Recurrent episodes of binge eating. An episode of binge eating is characterized&#xD;
                  by both of the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  eating, in discrete period of time (eg, within any two hour period), an&#xD;
                       amount of food that is definitely larger than most people would eat in a&#xD;
                       similar period of time under similar circumstances&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  a sense of lack of control over eating during the episode (eg, a feeling&#xD;
                       that one cannot stop eating or control what or how much one is eating)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  The binge eating episodes are associated with at least three of the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  eating much more rapidly than normal&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  eating until uncomfortably full&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  eating large amounts of food when not feeling physically hungry&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  eating alone because of being embarrassed by how much one is eating&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  feeling disgusted with oneself, depressed, or feeling very guilty after&#xD;
                       overeating&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Marked distress regarding binge eating.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  The binge eating occurs, on average, at least two days a week for six months.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Does not occur exclusively during the course of bulimia nervosa and anorexia&#xD;
                  nervosa.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Men or women, from the ages of 21 through 65 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Female subjects must either:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  be incapable of pregnancy because of hysterectomy or tubal ligation.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  if heterosexually active and capable of pregnancy, have been using an acceptable&#xD;
                  method of contraception (hormonal contraceptives, intrauterine device, spermicide&#xD;
                  and barrier or double barrier methods) for at least 1 month before study entry&#xD;
                  and agree to continue the use of one of these contraception methods for the&#xD;
                  duration of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  if sexually abstinent and capable of pregnancy, agree to continue abstinence or&#xD;
                  to use an acceptable method of birth control (either hormonal contraceptives,&#xD;
                  intrauterine device, spermicide and barrier or double barrier method) should&#xD;
                  sexual activity commence.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Subjects who have a current or past history of clinically significant suicidality (as&#xD;

             Subjects who have made &gt; 1 lifetime suicide attempt and those with a MADRS suicide&#xD;
             item score &gt; 2 will be excluded from participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects who have a lifetime history of a DSM-IV-TR diagnosis of a substance abuse or&#xD;
             dependence disorder, except for nicotine abuse or dependence (as determined by&#xD;
             psychiatric history, SCID interview, and urine toxicology; see below).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects who have a lifetime history of a DSM-IV-TR psychotic disorder, bipolar&#xD;
             disorder, or dementia.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects who have a history of a personality disorder (eg, schizotypal, borderline, or&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Clinically unstable medical disease, including cardiovascular, hepatic, renal,&#xD;
             gastrointestinal, pulmonary, metabolic, endocrine or other systemic disease which&#xD;
             could interfere with diagnosis, assessment, or treatment of binge eating disorder with&#xD;
             sodium oxybate. Patients should be biochemically euthyroid prior to entering the&#xD;
             study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of obstructive sleep apnea (OBS) or receiving a high risk score for OBS on the&#xD;
             Berlin Questionnaire (75).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects requiring treatment with any drug which might interact adversely with or&#xD;
             obscure the action of the study medication (e.g. stimulants, sympathomimetics,&#xD;
             antidepressants, carbonic anhydrase inhibitors, anti-obesity drugs, drugs with CNS&#xD;
             depressant effects).&#xD;
&#xD;

             randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects who have begun and/or are receiving formal psychotherapy (cognitive&#xD;
             behavioral therapy, interpersonal therapy, or dietary behavioral therapy) for BED or&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Subjects previously enrolled in this study or have previously been treated with sodium&#xD;
             oxybate.&#xD;

          -  Subjects who have received an experimental drug or used an experimental device within&#xD;
             30 days.&#xD;
