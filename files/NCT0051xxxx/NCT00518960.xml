  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the effectiveness of ProAlgaZyme in increasing&#xD;
      levels of HDL 'good' cholesterol and decreasing total cholesterol and C-reactive protein in&#xD;
      patients with Metabolic Syndrome.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the most common cause of mortality in the United States. In&#xD;
      1988, Reaven, et al. published findings that indicate a majority of individuals who developed&#xD;
      CVD had multiple concurrent risk factors including dyslipidemia, hypertension, and&#xD;
      hyperglycemia. Reaven, et al., defined this cluster of risk factors as Syndrome X and&#xD;
      hypothesized that insulin resistance was the underlying factor in its development. Over time,&#xD;
      metabolic syndrome has been used as a more meaningful term and additional risk factors have&#xD;
      been associated with its diagnosis (Grundy, et al. 2004). Metabolic syndrome is an&#xD;
      increasingly prevalent problem in the United States and other westernized nations. It is&#xD;
      estimated that approximately 50 million Americans have metabolic syndrome. The risk factors&#xD;
      linked to metabolic syndrome include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Abdominal obesity&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Atherogenic dyslipidemia (high triglycerides, low HDL cholesterol and high LDL&#xD;
           cholesterol)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Elevated blood pressure&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Insulin resistance with or without glucose intolerance&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pro-thrombotic state (e.g., high fibrinogen or plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 in the&#xD;
           blood)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pro-inflammatory state [e.g. elevated C-reactive protein (CRP)in the blood]&#xD;
&#xD;
      The management goals for metabolic syndrome include reducing the risk for developing CVD and&#xD;
      type 2 diabetes. Therefore, therapy is directed at reducing LDL cholesterol, blood pressure&#xD;
      and glucose as well as increasing HDL cholesterol levels. Additional interventions to control&#xD;
      blood pressure and lipids provide the next line of treatment for patients with metabolic&#xD;
      syndrome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ProAlgaZyme, a novel fermentation product of a freshwater algae ecosystem, will be evaluated&#xD;
      in this trial for its effects on circulating lipids. According to the sponsor, ProAlgaZyme is&#xD;
      expected to increase the circulating levels of HDL cholesterol while lowering total&#xD;
      cholesterol and CRP. ProAlgaZyme was previously tested in a double blind, placebo controlled,&#xD;
      pilot trial in 60 subjects with metabolic syndrome (30 subjects per arm), conducted at the&#xD;
      University of Yaound√©, Cameroon. Statistically significant (p &lt; 0.05 or better) improvements&#xD;
      were seen in total cholesterol, HDL-C and C-reactive protein when compared to placebo. (In&#xD;
      Press - Lipids in Health and Disease)&#xD;
&#xD;
      The present study will evaluate the effect of ProAlgaZyme versus placebo on blood lipids and&#xD;
      hsCRP in subjects who meet the criteria for Metabolic Syndrome.&#xD;
