    <textblock>
      Recent research provides evidence that disrupted circadian rhythms, including hormonal&#xD;
      patterns and sleep, are associated with increased risk of breast cancer incidence and faster&#xD;
      progression to mortality. We have observed that a loss of normal diurnal cortisol rhythm&#xD;
      associated with more awakenings during the night predicts early mortality with metastatic&#xD;
      breast cancer. Other recent studies have shown that nighttime shift work is associated with&#xD;
      higher breast cancer incidence, and in a murine model disrupting circadian cortisol cycles&#xD;
      produced a doubling of implanted tumor growth. There is also recent evidence that abnormal&#xD;
      clock genes are associated with cancer. However, it is not clear whether sleep disruption per&#xD;
      se affects breast cancer progression, or whether such an effect is mediated by hormonal and&#xD;
      immune dysregulation of this prevalent and hormone-mediated cancer. We propose to study sleep&#xD;
      disruption as a prognostic factor in the progression of metastatic breast cancer. We will&#xD;
      also examine sleep patterns in association with disrupted circadian rhythms of cortisol,&#xD;
      ACTH, and melatonin as well as measures of immune function known to be salient to breast&#xD;
      cancer progression. These are natural killer cell cytoxicity and specific cytokine, IL-6. We&#xD;
      plan to recruit 105 women 45 years through 75 years with metastatic or recurrent breast&#xD;
      cancer and 20 age and SES-matched controls for a two-week at home sleep study with Actiwatch&#xD;
      and two nights of in-home EEG monitoring, followed by 28 hours of continuous blood sampling&#xD;
      and one night of EEG sleep monitoring in our lab at Stanford. This will provide a full&#xD;
      examination of circadian hormones associated with sleep patterns. We will relate these&#xD;
      assessments to the subsequent course of breast cancer progression. Results of this study will&#xD;
      provide specific evidence regarding how improved sleep management may affect the course of&#xD;
      breast cancer. Aim 1: To study 24-hr diurnal rhythms of HPA axis hormones and melatonin in&#xD;
      women with metastatic or recurrent breast cancer. Hypothesis 1: Women with metastatic or&#xD;
      recurrent breast cancer will have reduced amplitude and disrupted phase of 24-hr diurnal&#xD;
      rhythms of cortisol, ACTH, and melatonin. Aim 2: To describe sleep disruption in women with&#xD;
      metastatic breast cancer and examine psychosocial, endocrine, and immune factors that may be&#xD;
      associated with sleep disruption. Hypothesis 2: Women with metastatic or recurrent breast&#xD;
      cancer will have a higher incidence of both at home and laboratory-examined sleep disruption&#xD;
      than control women without breast cancer. Hypothesis 3: Poorer sleep quality will be&#xD;
      associated with more pain, more emotional suppression in response to stressors, less&#xD;
      emotional support, greater depression and anxiety, and greater perceived and traumatic&#xD;
      stress. Hypothesis 4: Poorer sleep quality and quantity of sleep and daytime sleepiness and&#xD;
      fatigue will be associated with abnormal circadian neuroendocrine (i.e., cortisol, ACTH, and&#xD;
      melatonin) and immune patterns (i.e., suppressed day and night time NK activity and loss of&#xD;
      NK rhythms; increased day time IL-6 levels and /or loss of IL-6 rhythm). Aim 3: To study the&#xD;
      relationship between sleep disruption and survival time among metastatic and recurrent breast&#xD;
      cancer patients. Hypothesis 5: Poorer sleep quality and quantity of sleep will predict&#xD;
      shorter survival. Hypothesis 6: Reduced diurnal amplitude and an abnormal phase of cortisol&#xD;
      will predict shorter survival. Explanatory Aim 4: To investigate whether sleep disruption&#xD;
      mediates the relation of psychosocial factors to health outcomes.&#xD;
