      Pharmacogenomics of Antidepressant Response in Children and Adolescents (PARCA) is a&#xD;
      sub-study of the Antidepressant Safety in Kids (ASK) study. PARCA and ASK are part of the&#xD;
      Child and Adolescent Psychiatry Trials Network (CAPTN).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) and serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor&#xD;
      (SNRI) medications are prescribed to approximately 2 to 3% of American children. Evidence&#xD;
      suggests that these medications are beneficial for treating obsessive-compulsive disorder&#xD;
      (OCD), anxiety disorders, and major depressive disorder. Following hearings in February and&#xD;
      September of 2004, the FDA mandated Black Box warnings for all antidepressants, cautioning&#xD;
      prescribers about the risk of treatment-emergent suicidal tendency in children and&#xD;
      adolescents treated with these drugs. Although prescribing waned somewhat following the&#xD;
      warning, many children continue to receive SSRIs and SNRIs for a variety of conditions that&#xD;
      do not have empirically validated alternative treatments. Therefore, there is a pressing need&#xD;
      to clearly understand the safety, tolerability, and effectiveness of SSRIs and SNRIs in&#xD;
      children and adolescents. This study will identify variations in differentially expressed&#xD;
      genes that may be involved in the development of suicidal events and certain behaviors in&#xD;
      youth exposed to antidepressant medications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific aims of the study include the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To establish a genetic susceptibility database by creating a DNA repository of 120&#xD;
           patients with a prospectively identified &quot;Suicidal Event&quot; and 360 closely matched&#xD;
           antidepressant-tolerant controls, including rigorous phenotypic characterization of&#xD;
           these patients;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To establish a genetic susceptibility database by creating a DNA repository of 120&#xD;
           patients with prospectively identified &quot;Behavioral Activation&quot; and 360 closely matched&#xD;
           antidepressant-tolerant controls, including rigorous phenotypic characterization of&#xD;
           these patients;&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To establish a genetic susceptibility database by creating a DNA repository of 120&#xD;
           patients with prospectively identified co-occurring &quot;Suicidal Event and Behavioral&#xD;
           Activation&quot; and 360 closely matched antidepressant-tolerant controls, including rigorous&#xD;
           phenotypic characterization of these patients;&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To identify genetic polymorphisms responsible for the development of &quot;Suicidal Events&quot;&#xD;
           using a candidate gene approach, including biosynthetic pathways, metabolizing enzymes,&#xD;
           transporters, ion channels, and receptors;&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. To identify genetic polymorphisms responsible for the development of &quot;Behavioral&#xD;
           Activation&quot; using a candidate gene approach, including biosynthetic pathways,&#xD;
           metabolizing enzymes, transporters, ion channels, and receptors;&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. To use these data along with data from the parent study, ASK, to better understand the&#xD;
           relationship between &quot;Suicidal Events&quot; and &quot;Behavioral Activation.&quot;&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will include participants of the ASK study who want to participate in the PARCA&#xD;
      study. Participants will use a self-collection kit to provide a saliva sample. The saliva&#xD;
      sample will be mailed to the study center for DNA analysis. There will be no study visits.&#xD;
