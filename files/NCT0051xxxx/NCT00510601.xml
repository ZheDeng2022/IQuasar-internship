    <textblock>
      A pilot study to examine the effects of LDL-Apheresis on patients with Stage III Congestive&#xD;
      Heart Failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study hypothesis: Decreased blood viscosity from receiving LDL-apheresis will decrease&#xD;
      workload on the heart and improve symptoms associated with the progression of Congestive&#xD;
      Heart Failure&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients who qualify for the study will receive 7 bi-weekly LDL-Apheresis treatments with the&#xD;
      Kaneka Liposorber device. Patients will assess their CHF symptoms using the KC Cardiomyopathy&#xD;
      questionnaire prior to each treatment. Blood levels of certain indices related to CHF and&#xD;
      safety profile labs will be drawn before and after the first and last treatment.&#xD;
