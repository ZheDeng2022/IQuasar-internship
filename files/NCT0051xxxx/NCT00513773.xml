    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to better understand the role of inflammation in the&#xD;
      pathophysiology of abdominal aortic aneurysm. In this study we hope to show better ways of&#xD;
      predicting risk in this condition by using a combination of FDG-PET with CT.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Cumulative experimental and pathological evidence support the postulate that inflammation may&#xD;
      serve as the unifying concept in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis and its complications.&#xD;
      Aneurysmal disease is associated with inflammatory cell infiltrate and enzymatic degradation&#xD;
      of the vessel wall. Although the risk of abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) rupture relates to&#xD;
      the maximum cross-sectional diameter, rapid expansion of the aortic diameters preceding&#xD;
      fissuration and rupture has been observed in AAA independently of their initial size.&#xD;
      However, current diagnostic modalities stratify risk of AAA rupture based solely on the size&#xD;
      of the aneurysm without factoring potentially useful information derivable from the degree of&#xD;
      aneurysmal wall inflammatory response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We propose to utilize fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET) imaging&#xD;
      co-registered with structural computerized tomography (CT) images for the in vivo&#xD;
      localization and quantification of vascular inflammation in patients with AAA in order to&#xD;
      determine whether increased inflammation within the walls of the aneurysm correlates with&#xD;
      rapid enlargement of AAA (change in aneurysmal diameter within 6 months), symptoms,&#xD;
      thrombosis, or intervention for ruptured, leaking, rapidly expanding, or painful AAAs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In patients with underlying abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA), the progression of disease i.e.&#xD;
      expansion is associated with increased inflammation within the aneurysm wall as characterized&#xD;
      by FDG-PET/CT, and the degree of inflammation is a risk predictor for adverse events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior studies have demonstrated that FDG uptake is greater in inflamed tissues, such as&#xD;
      infectious foci and tumors. In chronic inflammatory lesions and malignancies, FDG uptake is&#xD;
      increased in macrophage-dense regions. The relatively high uptake of FDG by macrophages is&#xD;
      attributed to the relatively high metabolic rates of macrophages, and the inability of&#xD;
      macrophages to store glycogen, making them more reliant upon external glucose as a source of&#xD;
      fuel. Activation of macrophages can further increase their glucose consumption. Both in&#xD;
      animal models and humans, inflamed blood vessels have been shown to have an increased uptake&#xD;
      of FDG. Several investigators have shown that FDG-PET can reliably detect inflammation in&#xD;
      atherosclerosis. Thus detection of enhanced FDG uptake in the aneurysmal walls of patients&#xD;
      with AAA may have potential significance.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Patients with AAA between 3 to 5 cm&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with AAA &gt; 5cm in whom the risk of operative intervention is prohibitive in&#xD;
             the opinion of the surgeon.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  No allergies to iodinated contrast.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Diabetic patients will be eligible for this study. Patient on metformin will be asked&#xD;
             not to take the drug for one day prior to and for two days after the procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects must be able to give informed consent&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with an impaired kidney function, significantly elevated creatinine levels&#xD;
             after angiography/PCI (serum creatinine level &gt;1.5 mg/dl) will be excluded form the&#xD;
             study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Unstable patients or those with decompensated heart failure will be excluded because&#xD;
             of safety reasons.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant or lactating women will be excluded. Pregnancy will need to be tested in all&#xD;
             pre-menopausal women.&#xD;
