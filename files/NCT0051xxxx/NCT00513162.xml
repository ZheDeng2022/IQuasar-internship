      Primary Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine the interindividual range and median of individual maximum tolerated doses of&#xD;
           valproic acid administered as one time evening dose in conjunction with a dose oral&#xD;
           etoposide (50 mg/m2/day for children, but only 25mg/m2/day for adults to start) for four&#xD;
           different age groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine the qualitative and quantitative toxicity and reversibility of toxicity of&#xD;
           valproic acid in conjunction with oral etoposide,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To investigate the clinical pharmacokinetics of valproic acid when given in conjunction&#xD;
           with oral etoposide,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To describe quality of life of patients with relapsed, or progressive central and&#xD;
           peripheral nervous system tumors when treated with oral valproic acid and etoposide,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To observe and describe the response pattern of progressive central nervous system&#xD;
           tumors treated with oral valproic acid and etoposide,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To observe and describe event free survival time and overall survival time of patients&#xD;
           with relapsed, or progressive central nervous system tumors when treated with oral&#xD;
           valproic acid and etoposide,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine if histone deacetylase activity and topoisomerase expression in lymphocytes&#xD;
           of patients is related to valproic acid levels, and&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine, if the individual maximal tolerated dose (iMTD) depends on the initial&#xD;
           performance status of the patient in the beginning of the treatment.&#xD;

      Study Drugs:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Etoposide is designed to block cell growth by breaking the DNA, which may cause the cells to&#xD;
      die.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Valproic acid was first designed as an anti-seizure medication. It was also found to change&#xD;
      cancer cells and make them more sensitive to etoposide.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening Tests:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before you start treatment on this study, you will have &quot;screening tests&quot;. These tests help&#xD;
      your doctor decide if you are eligible to take part in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Your medical history will be reviewed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a physical exam.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will be asked how well you are able to perform the normal activities of daily living&#xD;
           (performance status evaluation).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will complete a questionnaire about your activities or daily living. The&#xD;
           questionnaire will take about 5 to 10 minutes to complete.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 2-3 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests. This routine blood draw&#xD;
           may include a pregnancy test for women who are able to have children. To be eligible to&#xD;
           take part in this study, the pregnancy test must be negative.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Urine may be collected to check for metabolic disease. This urine sample may include a&#xD;
           pregnancy test for women who are able to have children. To be eligible to take part in&#xD;
           this study, the pregnancy test must be negative.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or computed tomography (CT) scan.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If your doctor thinks it is necessary, you may have additional blood and/or urine tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dose Escalation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      When you begin the study, you will begin receiving the lowest dose level of valproic acid.&#xD;
      Every week, the dose will be increased. This will continue until the maximum tolerated dose&#xD;
      (MTD) is found. Once the MTD is found, you will continue to receive that dose level of&#xD;
      valproic acid while you are on study. However, if your doctor thinks it is necessary, this&#xD;
      dose level could be lowered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are a child (less than or equal to 18 years of age), the amount of etoposide that you&#xD;
      take while on study will not change.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are an adult (more than 18 years of age), your will receive a low dose of etoposide&#xD;
      while the MTD of valproic acid is being found. After the MTD of valproic acid is found, your&#xD;
      dose of etoposide will be increased every week until the MTD is found. However, if your&#xD;
      doctor thinks it is necessary, this dose level could be lowered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Drug Administration:&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will receive valproic acid and etoposide every evening in pill form.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you have difficulty swallowing the pills, etoposide can be given in the evening in liquid&#xD;
      form. Valproic acid can be given in liquid form, divided in 2 doses per day, 1 in the morning&#xD;
      and 1 in the evening.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Visits During Dose Escalation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      While your valproic acid or etoposide medication is being increased, every week you will have&#xD;
      a physical exam and blood (about 2-3 tablespoons)and urine will be collected for routine&#xD;
      tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Every other month, you will have CT or MRI scans to check the status of the disease. You may&#xD;
      have these tests and procedures more often if your doctor thinks it is necessary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Visits After Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD):&#xD;
&#xD;
      Every month, you will have a physical exam, and blood (about 2-3 tablespoons) and urine will&#xD;
      be collected for routine tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Every other month, you will have CT or MRI scans to check the status of the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Every 6 months, a portion of the blood or urine collected for routine tests will be used for&#xD;
      a pregnancy test for women who are able to have children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      -You may have these tests and procedures more often if your doctor thinks it is necessary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Length of Study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      You may remain on study for up to 2 years. You will be taken off study if the disease gets&#xD;
      worse or intolerable side effects occur.&#xD;
&#xD;
      End-of-Study Visit:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once you are off study, you will have an end-of-study visit. At this visit, the following&#xD;
      tests and procedures will be performed:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a physical exam.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 2-3 tablespoons) and urine will be collected for routine tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If your doctor thinks it is necessary, you will have a CT or MRI to check the status of&#xD;
           the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-Up:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once you are off study, you will be contacted by telephone once a year to check the status of&#xD;
      the disease. The phone call will take 2-3 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an investigational study. Etoposide is FDA approved and commercially available.&#xD;
      Valproic acid is FDA approved and commercially available for the treatment of seizures. The&#xD;
      use of these drugs together is investigational. Up to 120 patients will take part in this&#xD;
      multicenter study. Up to 100 will be enrolled at M. D. Anderson.&#xD;
