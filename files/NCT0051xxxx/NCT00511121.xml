  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase II multicenter, open-label study designed to investigate the feasibility&#xD;
      (tolerance, compliance and safety) of a combination of the tyrosine kinase inhibitor STI 571&#xD;
      (GLIVEC, Novartis Pharma) with a pegylated *-Interferon 2b (PEG INTRON). The rationale for&#xD;
      testing this combination is that 1) aIFN is curently the first line agent for the treatment&#xD;
      of CML, 2) the pegylated formulation of aIFN is more convenient and is better tolerated than&#xD;
      the conventional formulation, 3) STI571 is currently the most promising investigational agent&#xD;
      for the treatment of CML because it is targeted to the molecular bases of the disease, is&#xD;
      effective also in the advanced phases of the disease, and is effective also in the cases who&#xD;
      are resistant to aIFN, 4) the mechanisms of action of the two agents are different. Therefore&#xD;
      the combination of STI571 and PEGINTRON is likely to provide the best treatment of CML and to&#xD;
      be tested very soon in randomized phase III studies of efficacy. So far STI571 and PEGINTRON&#xD;
      have been investigated separately. The present study is an exploratory study that has been&#xD;
      planned with the aim of evaluating the adverse events and the safety of the combination, so&#xD;
      as to identify a safe and tolerable regime that can be tested prospectively for efficacy in a&#xD;
      subsequent, randomized phase III study. Based on available knowledge and data, STI571 is more&#xD;
      specific and can be more effective than PEGINTRON. Therefore in this exploratory study STI571&#xD;
      is given a priority over PEGINTRON as to dose and dose adaptation. Sixty subjects with&#xD;
      chronic phase CML, previously untreated with any one of study drugs, will be enrolled over a&#xD;
      3 months period and will be treated and studied for 12 months. The patients can be pretreated&#xD;
      with hydroxyurea , whenever required, hence are treated with STI 571 at a fixed dose (400mg)&#xD;
      and with PEG-Intron at doses ranging from 50 to 150 *g weekly (the first cohort of 20&#xD;
      patients at 50 *g/w, the second cohort of 20 patients at 100 *g/w and the third cohort of 20&#xD;
      patients at 150 *g/w). The response (hematologic, cytogenetic and molecular) to the&#xD;
      combination treatment will be evaluated every 3 months, and the pharmacokinetics of study&#xD;
      drugs will be studied in a sample of study patients. The duration of the study is 12 months,&#xD;
      for a total trial time of 15 months.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      STI 571 and *IFN are the two single most effective agents for the treatment of CML. Their&#xD;
      mechanisms of actions are different. Their toxicity is also different, but both spare normal&#xD;
      hemopoietic stem cells. STI 571 is well tolerated, while conventional *IFN is poorly&#xD;
      tolerated, especially in the elderly. PEG *IFNs are going to substitute for conventional&#xD;
      *IFNs because of a better pharmacokinetic and toxicity profile and because require less&#xD;
      injections (once a week vs. once a day).Resistance to IFN (6-13) and to STI571 (29-34) occurs&#xD;
      in vitro and in vivo, where it increases with time for IFN and is also expected to increase&#xD;
      with time for STI571. STI571 and IFN have different mechanisms of action and it has been&#xD;
      shown in vitro that the combination of STI571 with alfaIFN is more toxic than either agent&#xD;
      alone against Ph positive cells (35-37). Therefore, a combination of STI 571 with a PEG *IFN&#xD;
      is worth testing. A phase II, dose-finding, exploratory study is required to investigate&#xD;
      feasibility, toxicity, safety and tolerability of the combination. In CML, PEG INTRON studies&#xD;
      are more advanced than PEGASIS studies. These considerations provide the rationale for this&#xD;
      phase II study of STI 571 and PEG INTRON in CML.&#xD;
