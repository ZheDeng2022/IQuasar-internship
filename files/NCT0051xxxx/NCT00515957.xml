      In this study NPC patient will receive 4 days of treatment with CD45 antibody followed by one&#xD;
      dose of LMP1- and LMP2-CTL. From this, we can learn if treating the patient first with the&#xD;
      CD45 antibody will also let LMP1- and LMP2-CTL we give grow better. In addition, we will find&#xD;
      out, if LMP1- and LMP2-CTL are safe and have enhanced anti-tumor activity in comparison to&#xD;
      standard EBV-CTL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aims to determine the safety of autologous LMP1- and LMP2- specific cytotoxic&#xD;
      T-lymphocytes (CTL) in combination with CD45 monoclonal antibody (MAb) in patients with&#xD;
      EBV-positive nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      And to obtain information on the expansion, persistence and anti-tumor effects of autologous&#xD;
      LMP1- and LMP-2 specific CTL given after lymphodepletion with CD45 MAb in patients with&#xD;
      EBV-positive NPC.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      While patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) may be cured by chemotherapy and&#xD;
      radiotherapy, the outlook for patients who are resistant to this treatment or who relapse is&#xD;
      poor. Almost all patients with undifferentiated nasopharyngeal carcinoma have the EBV virus&#xD;
      in their tumors which may be a target for immunotherapy approaches. We have successfully used&#xD;
      specialized immune system cells grown in the laboratory and trained to recognize and kill EBV&#xD;
      infected cells (EBV-specific cytotoxic T-lymphocytes [EBV-CTL]) to prevent and treat another&#xD;
      type of cancer called post transplant lymphoma that occurs after bone marrow transplant. In&#xD;
      post transplant lymphoma, the tumor cells have 9 proteins made by EBV on their surface.&#xD;
      However in nasopharyngeal carcinoma that develops in patients with a normal immune system,&#xD;
      the tumor cells only express 2 EBV proteins that are much harder for the immune system to&#xD;
      recognize. In a previous study we made EBV-CTL that recognized all 9 proteins and gave them&#xD;
      to patients with NPC. For patients without evidence of active disease at the time of therapy,&#xD;
      there disease remains in remission. For those patients with active disease at the time they&#xD;
      received CTL, some patients had a partial response to this therapy, and only three patients&#xD;
      had a complete response. We think the main reason for this is that many of the T cells&#xD;
      reacted with EBV proteins that were not on the tumor cells, and the other is that the infused&#xD;
      T cells have not enough space to grow.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The two EBV proteins present on NPC tumor cells that are good targets for T-cell therapies&#xD;
      are called LMP1 and LMP2. We are therefore planing to generate T cells specific for LMP1 and&#xD;
      LMP2 and infuse these cells into NPC patients. To make LMP1- and LMP2-CTL, we have obtained&#xD;
      blood from the patients and grown special type of cell called a dendritic cell (DC) and EBV&#xD;
      infected lymphoblastoid cells (LCL). We have then transferred an adenovirus vector that&#xD;
      carries the LMP1 and LMP2 gene into the DC and the LCL. These DC and LCL are then treated&#xD;
      with radiation so they cannot grow and are used to stimulate and expand LMP1- and LMP2-CTL.&#xD;
      This stimulation trains the T cells to kill cancer cells with LMP1 and LMP2 on their surface.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To 'create space' for EBV-CTL growth after infusion in NPC patients we have already used a&#xD;
      special protein called a CD45 antibody, which removes for a short period of time most of the&#xD;
      patient's T cells. The preliminary results of this study is encouraging: the use of the CD45&#xD;
      antibody is safe and we observed enhanced EBV-CTL growth after infusion. In addition, all&#xD;
      patients who has EBV-CTL growth had clinical responses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We and others have demonstrated the feasibility of CTL therapy for EBV-positive NPC in&#xD;
      immunocompetent patients, providing preliminary evidence of anti-tumor activity of EBV-CTL in&#xD;
      this patient population. Not all patients responded, however, suggesting the need for further&#xD;
      improvement. We propose that CTL failure can be overcome by increasing the specificity of the&#xD;
      infused CTL product. That is, infusion of CTL specific for LMP1 and LMP2 will produce greater&#xD;
      clinical benefit than EBV-specific CTL. The rationale for this approach is straight forward:&#xD;
      EBV-specific CTL lines generated by standard methods are dominated by T-cell clones not&#xD;
      reactive to the subdominant EBV proteins LMP1 and LMP2 expressed in NPC. We also propose that&#xD;
      the failure of adoptively transferred CTL to measurably expand in the peripheral blood of NPC&#xD;
      patients is a consequence both of lymphoid homeostasis in these lympho-replete patients and&#xD;
      of the inhibitory T-cell infiltrate at the sites of disease. We will therefore use monoclonal&#xD;
      antibodies targeting the CD45 antigen (CD45 MAbs), to lymphodeplete NPC patients prior to the&#xD;
      infusion of EBV-specific CTL. Preliminary results indicate that CD45 MAb depletion can&#xD;
      augment CTL expansion, and that such expansion is associated with a higher disease response&#xD;
      rate. We will confirm and extend these promising new data in this Phase I clinical trial.&#xD;
