      Results in CP are better in patients treated early after the onset of the disease with&#xD;
      respect to late CP . To date, the early McR rate to imatinib is clearly higher in low and&#xD;
      intermediate risk versus high risk (88 and 84% versus 65%). High dose of imatinib, as shown&#xD;
      in phase I-III trials may offer the possibility to increase the response rate of patients&#xD;
      belonging to this risk category.&#xD;

      This is a phase II multicenter, open-label study designed to investigate the efficacy&#xD;
      (hematological response, cytogenetic response and molecular response) and feasibility&#xD;
      (tolerance, compliance and safety) of the tyrosine kinase inhibitor imatinib mesylate&#xD;
      (formerly STI 571, GLIVECÔ, Novartis Pharma) at high dose (800 mg/daily) (serial number&#xD;
      protocol ICSG/CML/021) in patients with Ph+ chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) in chronic phase&#xD;
      (CP) previously untreated, at intermediate Sokal risk.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With aIFN, responses (HR and CgR) are significantly influenced by the disease phase and, in&#xD;
      CP patients, by risk. aIFN induces rare and short lived HR and CgR (any degree) in late CP&#xD;
      and particularly in accelerated and blastic phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Moreover, in CP patients Sokal's risk influences significantly the probability of obtaining a&#xD;
      MCgR after aIfaIFN . As far as survival, after aIFN even in CCgR patients, the long term&#xD;
      survival is signifcantly influenced by risk. The European investigators on Interferon in CML&#xD;
      (EICML) collected informations on response and survival on 317 complete cytogenetic&#xD;
      responders to IFN. The 10 years survival of the whole patients population was 75% but, after&#xD;
      stratification by risk, a significant difference in 10 years survival rates was found in&#xD;
      favour of low risk patients (89%) if compared with intermediate risk (70%) and high risk&#xD;
      patients (54%) (low vs high risk p 0.0001; intermediate vs high p 0.003, log-rank test).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Long term survival data still lacks after imatinib. However, it has been already shown that&#xD;
      the disease phase influences the efficacy of imatinib in CML: responses (HR and particularly&#xD;
      CgR) are better in CP versus accelerated and blastic phase. Results in CP are better in&#xD;
      patients treated early after the onset of the disease with respect to late CP . To date, the&#xD;
      early McR rate to imatinib is clearly higher in low and intermediate risk versus high risk&#xD;
      (88 and 84% versus 65%).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two scoring systems are available for disease risk evaluation, Sokal and Euro. Sokal risk is&#xD;
      based on chemotherapy treated patients and Euro risk is based on aIFN trated patients: it is&#xD;
      not known to date if one or both of the scoring systems will apply to imatinib treated&#xD;
      patients. Moreover, the Sokal system has been applied to stratify the patients by risk in all&#xD;
      the large clinical trials of imatinib in CML in the last 3 years and consequently, Sokal&#xD;
      score will be employed in the present trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine the rate of complete cytogenetic response at 12 months in adult patients with&#xD;
      previously untreated intermediate Sokal risk CML treated with imatinib 800 mg/daily&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The rate of major cytogenetic response at 6 and 12 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The kinetic of cytogenetic response at 6 and 12 months&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. The duration of complete cytogenetic response.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. The rate and duration of hematologic response.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. The degree and the timing of molecular response&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. The time to accelerated and blast crisis and overall survival&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. The safety and tolerability of the treatment.&#xD;
