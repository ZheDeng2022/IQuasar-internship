    <textblock>
      This study is being conducted to obtain information on the safety and tolerability of&#xD;
      repeated doses of GW823296 for 28 days in healthy male and female subjects. In addition, the&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics of GW823296 will be evaluated to confirm the doses to be used in Phase II&#xD;
      efficacy studies. The effect of repeat dose (RD) of GW823296 on CYP3A4 enzyme activity will&#xD;
      be investigated evaluating the pharmacokinetics of midazolam and urine&#xD;
      6-?-hydroxycortisol/cortisol ratio.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Healthy as determined by a Physician Responsible, based on a medical evaluation&#xD;
             including history, physical examination, laboratory tests, cardiac monitoring. A&#xD;
             subject with a clinical abnormality or laboratory variables outside the reference&#xD;
             range for the population being studied, with the exception of liver transaminases,&#xD;
             troponin I and TSH, may be included only if the Investigator considers that the&#xD;
             finding will not introduce additional risk factors and will not interfere with the&#xD;
             study procedures. Please note that subjects should have liver transaminases, troponin&#xD;
             I and TSH values within the range specified in the exclusion criteria below.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Women of non-childbearing potential (i.e., physiologically incapable of becoming&#xD;
             pregnant with documentation of hysterectomy or bilateral ovariectomy &gt;6 months,&#xD;
             including any female who is postmenopausal. For purposes of this study, postmenopausal&#xD;
             is defined as one year without menses and confirmed by FSH according to the local&#xD;
             laboratory ranges at screening) and having a negative serum hCG pregnancy test at&#xD;
             screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  No co-morbid Psychiatric Disorders as defined using the Mini International&#xD;
             Neuropsychiatric Interview (M.I.N.I) scale&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Aged 18-65 years, inclusive&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A 12-lead ECG and 24-hours Holter ECG at screening showed no abnormalities that in the&#xD;
             opinion of the Principal Investigator will compromise safety in this study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Body weight &gt;50 kg and body mass index (BMI) within the range 19.0-29.9 kg/m2&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects with a history of peptic ulcer disease (PUD) with a known aetiology must&#xD;
             provide documentation by a gastroenterologist of the aetiology of the PUD and that&#xD;
             effective treatment was provided with full eradication of ulcers and symptoms. For&#xD;
             such subjects appropriate steps must also have been taken to minimize reoccurrence&#xD;
             risk (i.e. if PUD was nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug [NSAID] induced, the subject&#xD;
             should no longer be taking NSAID medications; if cause was Helicobacter pylori [H.&#xD;
             pylori], the subject should have been appropriately treated). For all subjects,&#xD;
             regardless of whether there is a positive history of PUD, sites are required to&#xD;
             document their H. pylori status at screening. Entry into the study is permitted for&#xD;
             subjects who are seropositive for H. pylori, but treatment is recommended, either&#xD;
             before or after study participation at the discretion of the Principal Investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Capable of giving written informed consent, which includes compliance with the&#xD;
             requirements and restrictions listed in the consent form&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The subject must be able to read, comprehend and record information.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A signed and dated written informed consent is obtained from the subject.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The subject is available to complete the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The subject has screening alanine aminotransferase (ALT) or aspartate aminotransferase&#xD;
             (AST) &gt;1.5x upper limit of the normal range (ULN); testing may be repeated once to see&#xD;
             if value returns to within acceptance range but any such laboratory abnormality must&#xD;
             be resolved by the baseline visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects with a troponin I value &gt;0.032 ng/mL at screening are not eligible. Testing&#xD;
             may not be repeated. The subject should be referred to the treating physician for&#xD;
             further evaluation, as appropriate.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects with a TSH value above the upper limit of the normal range (ULN) at screening&#xD;
             are not eligible. The subject should be referred to the treating physician for further&#xD;
             evaluation, as appropriate. Testing may be repeated once to see whether the value&#xD;

             baseline visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects found to have stool positive for occult blood. If such a stool was obtained&#xD;
             without the subject abstaining from red meat for 3 or more days prior to testing, this&#xD;
             may be repeated once following such abstinence. If that stool is negative for occult&#xD;
             blood the subject is considered eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Subjects with a history of myopathy or rhabdomyolysis&#xD;

          -  The subject is unable to abstain from strenuous physical activity for 72 hours prior&#xD;
             to screening, for 72 hours prior first dosing until the last PK sample has been&#xD;
             collected, and for 72 hours prior to the follow-up visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The subject has donated a unit of blood (450 mL) within the previous 60 days or&#xD;
             intends to donate in the month after completing the study.&#xD;

             until the end of the study period (follow-up visit).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Typical consumption of more than 14 alcoholic units in any week, or more than 3 (for&#xD;
             males) or 2 (for females) alcoholic units in any single day, over the month preceding&#xD;
             the screening visit [NOTE: 1 unit = 8 oz beer, 3 oz wine, or 1 oz hard liquor]&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The subject smokes or has smoked in the last 3 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The subject has tested positive for Hepatitis C antibody or Hepatitis B surface&#xD;
             antigen.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  The subject has a past history of drug abuse or has tested positive for urine drugs of&#xD;
             abuse at screening. A minimum list of drugs that will be screened for include&#xD;

             relevant eye examination finding, which in the opinion of the study ophthalmologist&#xD;
             contraindicates their participation in the study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Vulnerable subject (e.g. kept in detention)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects who have had hypersensitivity or intolerance to NK1 antagonists&#xD;
