  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will determine if medical treatment of colitis (inflammation of the colon&#xD;
      resulting in loose bowel movements, rectal bleeding, and belly pain) that is used for other&#xD;
      colitis conditions, such as Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, is safe and effective for&#xD;
      treating colitis in patients with Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome (HPS). HPS is a hereditary&#xD;
      disorder that causes albinism, visual impairment, and abnormal bleeding. Some patients also&#xD;
      develop colitis, pulmonary fibrosis, and kidney disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with HPS and colitis who are 18 years of age or older may be eligible for this&#xD;
      study. Participants receive treatment for their colitis symptoms with one or more of several&#xD;
      study drugs, which include mesalamine (5-ASA), corticosteroids, infliximab and&#xD;
      6-mercaptopurine, adalimumab and tacrolimus. The drugs are added to the treatment plan one at&#xD;
      a time to find the combination that works best for the individual patient. Patients who&#xD;
      respond to one or more of the medications may continue treatment with that same combination&#xD;
      for up to 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Regular clinic visits are scheduled for blood tests, symptoms ratings questionnaires and&#xD;
      periodic physical examinations and colonoscopies to measure the response to treatment and&#xD;
      evaluate any side effects.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this study is to detect patterns of immune abnormalities in the&#xD;
      colitis associated with Hermansky-Pudlak Syndrome (HPS). Additionally we aim to document the&#xD;
      clinical response to and tolerance of conventional inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) therapy&#xD;
      for HPS patients with active colitis associated with Hermansky-Pudlak Syndrome (HPS). HPS is&#xD;
      a rare autosomal recessive disorder causing dysfunctional lysosome-related organelle&#xD;
      formation and trafficking resulting in oculocutaneous albinism and a bleeding diathesis&#xD;
      secondary to platelet dysfunction. Associated conditions include pulmonary fibrosis, IBD, and&#xD;
      systemic ceroid deposition. The associated IBD has been reported to occur at a higher&#xD;
      frequency in the HPS-1 and HPS-4 subtypes compared to the prevalence of IBD in non-HPS&#xD;
      populations. HPS IBD has clinical features of both ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's&#xD;
      disease, but histologically resembles Crohn's disease in that granulomas are commonly seen in&#xD;
      the mucosa of the intestine. The pathogenesis of HPS IBD is not fully understood and little&#xD;
      data beyond descriptions of the clinical and histologic manifestations have been published.&#xD;
      Furthermore reports on treatment of the colitis in HPS patients are largely anecdotal, and&#xD;
      our own experience suggests that many patients may be under-treated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HPS patients with active colitis will be enrolled into this prospective treatment study.&#xD;
      Endpoints for the immunopathogenesis studies will include baseline measurements of and&#xD;
      changes in immune cell populations, cytokine, and chemokine expression. In the blood and gut&#xD;
      mucosa. Endpoints for the study of response to treatment will include changes in clinical,&#xD;
      endoscopic, and histologic scores as well as the rate and severity of adverse events.&#xD;
      Descriptive summary statistical analysis (n, mean, median, standard deviation, minimum and&#xD;
      maximum range) and simple correlations of clinical response variables with immune parameters&#xD;
      will be done.&#xD;

    <description>Oral mesalamine will be used as initial therapy in patients who are not taking any medication or have not received any prior treatment for their IBD. Dosing will begin at 2.4 g PO QD and will be increased to 4.8 g QD within 2 weeks. Topical mesalamine (enema 4 g PR HS/BID or suppository 1 g PR HS/BID) may be added for patients with inflammation that is limited to the rectum (proctitis) or who have prominent complaints of urgency, incomplete evacuation or rectal bleeding.</description>

    <description>Add oral corticosteroids (prednisone) to mesalamine. The standard induction dose will be 40 mg/day. After 1 week of therapy, if the total SCCAI score has decreased by greater than or equal to 2 points the patient will continue on another week of therapy. If the SCCAI has not decreased by greater than or equal to 2 points (indicative of a reduction in symptoms) at one week, then the dose will be increased to 60 mg/day. Patients on either dosage will have another SCCAI assessment done a week later (2 weeks after beginning corticosteroids), and if they are found to be in remission (SCCAI less than or equal to 2), a steroid-tapering schedule will be initiated.</description>
