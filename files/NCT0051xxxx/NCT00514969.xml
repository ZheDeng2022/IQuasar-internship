  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase II, multi-center, open-label, non-randomized trial. During Part 1 of the&#xD;
      trial, patients will receive once daily oral administration of STI571 at a dose of 600 mg for&#xD;
      24 weeks. After completing 24 weeks of therapy, patients may be eligible to receive&#xD;
      additional therapy during Part 2 of the trial provided that, in the opinion of the&#xD;
      investigator, the patient has benefited from treatment with STI571 and in the absence of&#xD;
      safety concerns. During Part 2 (which is of indefinite duration), patients will continue to&#xD;
      receive STI571 on a daily basis until either death, the development of intolerable toxicity&#xD;
      or the investigator feels it is no longer in the patient's best interest to continue therapy,&#xD;
      whichever comes first.&#xD;

&#xD;
               -  percentage of blasts in blood or bone marrow * 15% but &lt; 30%&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  percentage of blasts plus promyelocytes in the peripheral blood or bone marrow *&#xD;
                  30% (providing that &lt; 30% blasts are present in the bone marrow)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  peripheral basophils * 20%&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  thrombocytopenia &lt; 100 x 109/L unrelated to therapy These criteria must be met&#xD;
                  within 4 weeks of administration of first dose of trial treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Blastic phase of CML defined as the presence of one or more of the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  percentage of blasts in blood or bone marrow * 30%&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  percentage of blasts and promyelocytes in blood or bone marrow * 50%&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  documented extramedullary blast involvement (skin, lymph node, bone, lung).&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Voluntary written informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Patients of childbearing potential wihout a negative pregnancy test prior to the&#xD;
             initiation of study drug. Barrier contraceptive precautions are to be used throughout&#xD;
             the trial in both sexes.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Patients with an ECOG Performance Status Score ** 3 (see Section 7.2.1)&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Creatinine levels more than 2 x's the ULN at the laboratory where the analysis was&#xD;
             performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Total serum bilirubin more than 1.5 x's the upper limit of the normal range (ULN) at&#xD;
             the laboratory where the analyses were performed; in patients with clinically&#xD;
             suspected leukemic involvement of the liver, total bilirubin more than 3 x's the ULN&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. AST (SGOT) or ALT (SGPT) more than 3 x's the upper limit of the normal range (ULN) at&#xD;
             the laboratory where the analyses were performed; in patients with clinically&#xD;
             suspected leukemic involvement of the liver, AST and ALT more than 5 x's the ULN&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Patients receiving treatment with interferon-alpha within 48 hours of Day 1.&#xD;

             recovery to have occurred in the nadir in blood counts. In practice, a full recovery&#xD;
             of blood counts may not be possible due to progression of the underlying disease.&#xD;
