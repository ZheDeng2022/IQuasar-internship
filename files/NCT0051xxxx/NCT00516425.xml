      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as doxorubicin, epirubicin, and cyclophosphamide,&#xD;
      work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by&#xD;
      stopping them from dividing. Giving combination chemotherapy after surgery may kill any tumor&#xD;
      cells that remain after surgery. Sometimes, after surgery, the tumor may not need more&#xD;
      treatment until it progresses. In this case, observation may be sufficient. It is not yet&#xD;
      known whether giving doxorubicin or epirubicin together with cyclophosphamide is more&#xD;
      effective than observation in treating older women with invasive breast cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE: This randomized phase III trial is studying doxorubicin or epirubicin and&#xD;
      cyclophosphamide to see how well they work compared with observation in treating older women&#xD;
      with invasive breast cancer.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To provide evidence for extending the current standard care in older women with invasive&#xD;
           breast carcinoma treated with adjuvant chemotherapy comprising doxorubicin hydrochloride&#xD;
           or epirubicin hydrochloride and cyclophosphamide.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Compare the relapse-free survival interval of these patients treated with adjuvant&#xD;
           chemotherapy vs no adjuvant chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Compare the toxicity of accelerated adjuvant chemotherapy with pegfilgrastim support vs&#xD;
           non-accelerated adjuvant chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to participating&#xD;
      center and indication for endocrine therapy (yes vs no). Patients are randomized to 1 of 2&#xD;
      arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Arm I (observation): Patients do not receive adjuvant chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Arm II (adjuvant chemotherapy): Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 chemotherapy regimens.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Accelerated adjuvant chemotherapy: Patients receive doxorubicin hydrochloride and&#xD;
                cyclophosphamide (AC) OR epirubicin hydrochloride and cyclophosphamide (EC) on day&#xD;
                1 and pegfilgrastim on day 2. Treatment repeats every 2 weeks for 4 courses in the&#xD;
                absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Non-accelerated adjuvant chemotherapy: Patients receive AC or EC on day 1.&#xD;
                Treatment repeats every 3 weeks for 4 courses in the absence of disease progression&#xD;
                or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients undergo tumor tissue and blood sample collection for biological, pharmacological,&#xD;
      and proteomic studies. Samples are initially used to establish a resource of materials&#xD;
      available for different research groups. Samples are also analyzed using SELDI or MALDI-ToF&#xD;
      technology to identify biological profiles that correlate with prognosis or predict response&#xD;
      to treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Quality of life is assessed at baseline, 6 weeks, 1 month, 6 months, 9 months, 12 months, 18&#xD;
      months, and 24 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 6 months for 2 years and&#xD;
      then annually thereafter.&#xD;
