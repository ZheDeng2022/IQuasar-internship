  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Mistletoe extract is one of the most common complementary treatments used in Europe. Recent&#xD;
      basic studies reported tumor response and survival prolongation in number of treatments with&#xD;
      Mistletoe preparations. There are evidence based data for using this drug as side effect&#xD;
      reducer when use in combination with chemotherapy regimen treatment. Other clinical data,&#xD;
      although not well based is that complementary treatment when used in combination with the&#xD;
      common oncology treatment has tumor response effect. Combinations with platinum compound and&#xD;
      a third generation cytotoxic agent have been accepted as 'standard of care' for patients with&#xD;
      advanced NSCLC. The combination of platinum compound and one of the new agents are associated&#xD;
      with response rates of 30-40% and a median survival of 8-11 months for advanced NSCLC&#xD;
      patients with good performance status.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study objective: Improvement in QOL, Improvement in the toxicity profile of the chemotherapy&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study design is to include 90 subjects. All subjects are treated with the common&#xD;
      chemotherapy treatment. 50 percent will be treated with Iscador as combination with their&#xD;
      common chemotherapy regimen. Common chemotherapy regimen used for NSCLC: Carboplatin and&#xD;
      Gemcitabine. All study participants will receive this same chemotherapy regimen. This&#xD;
      chemotherapy treatment is given every 3 weeks for up to 6 treatment cycles. The first day of&#xD;
      the first treatment cycle, the combination of both Carboplatin and Gemcitabine will be&#xD;
      administered. After a week (day 8 of treatment cycle) only Gemcitabine will be administered.&#xD;
      Drugs would be calculated according to patient's body mass, renal function and general&#xD;
      appearance. Once the patient signed Informed Consent he is assigned randomly to be treated&#xD;
      with/without the injections of Mistletoe (called &quot;Iscador&quot;). Patient will receive the study&#xD;
      medication (Iscador) as an intravenous injection that can be self injected or injected by any&#xD;
      other of the family. Injections would be administered with low dose at the first week of the&#xD;
      first treatment cycle and then, dose would be escalated, so as to check high sensitivity to&#xD;
      the drug. Dosage would include: 2 injections of 0.1 mg, 2 injections of 0.1 mg and 2&#xD;
      injections of 1 mg. After that, treatment would continue with dosage of 10 g once every 2&#xD;
      days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients from both treatment arms would be asked to fill-out QOL questionnaires at every&#xD;
      treatment cycle and at follow-up visit after.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Primary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Improvement in QOL&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Improvement in the toxicity profile of the chemotherapy treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Improvement in time to tumor progression (TTP) and survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Safety profile of mistletoe extract with combination of chemotherapy treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a single center study, randomized phase II, with patients with advanced NSCLC treated&#xD;
      with carboplatin/gemcitabine chemotherapy combination.&#xD;
