    <textblock>
      This is a phase 2 open-label trial designed to evaluate the efficacy of tildrakizumab in&#xD;
      improving graft-versus-host disease (GVHD)-free relapse-free survival after myeloablative&#xD;
      allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (alloHCT) for hematologic malignancy.&#xD;

      Study Rationale: GVHD remains a major cause of morbidity and mortality following&#xD;
      myeloablative conditioning (MAC) alloHCT. Proinflammatory cytokines play a central role in&#xD;
      initiation and development of acute GVHD and as such, inhibition of these cytokines has been&#xD;
      examined for both prevention and treatment of GVHD. Interleukin (IL)-23 is a proinflammatory&#xD;
      cytokine which the investigators' lab has shown to have a unique and selective role in&#xD;
      induction of colonic inflammation during acute GVHD and that this cytokine serves as a&#xD;
      critical mediator linking conditioning regimen-induced mucosal injury and endotoxin&#xD;
      lipopolysaccharide (LPS) translocation to subsequent proinflammatory cytokine production and&#xD;
      GVHD-associated pathological damage. Moreover, additional studies have demonstrated that&#xD;
      blocking the IL-23 signaling pathway has not abrogated the graft-versus-tumor effect.&#xD;
      Tildrakizumab is a commercially available anti-IL-23 antibody FDA approved for the treatment&#xD;
      of moderate to severe psoriasis with good tolerance. The investigators hypothesize that&#xD;
      blocking IL-23, with tildrakizumab, will reduce GVHD rates for patients undergoing MAC&#xD;
      alloHCT without having an impact on relapse rates, thus improving GVHD-free relapse-free&#xD;
      survival (GRFS).&#xD;
