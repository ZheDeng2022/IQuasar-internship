&#xD;
      Secondary Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To assess the mechanism and cytokines change of Antroquinonol in patients with atopic&#xD;
      dermatitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exploratory Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To explore potential relationships between Antroquinonol exposure and safety and efficacy&#xD;
      endpoints.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase II, three-arms, double-blind, dosing-ranging, placebo-controlled trial&#xD;
      evaluating the efficacy of Antroquinonol in patients with atopic dermatitis. The study is&#xD;
      conducted in compliance with the guidelines for Good Clinical Practice and the Declaration of&#xD;
      Helsinki. Approval is obtained from the local ethics committee or institutional review board&#xD;
      at each study center. All the patients provided written informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      60 patients totally (20 patients per arm) with atopic dermatitis will receive Antroquinonol&#xD;
      or placebo. A patient will have received at one dose of Antroquinonol or placebo with&#xD;
      tropical urea ointment and have three baseline scores assessment (see Statistical Methods).&#xD;
      Enrollment will continue until the target number of evaluable patients has been enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Written informed consent must be obtained from all patients before initiating Screening. The&#xD;
      Screening period will be up to 14 days in duration (Days -14 to -1). Following completion of&#xD;
      all Screening assessments and confirmation of eligibility criteria, patients will receive&#xD;
      Antroquinonol 50mg, 100mg or placebo per day (QD) on Day 0 for 12 weeks or until documented&#xD;
      evidence of unacceptable toxicity, non-compliance or withdrawal of consent by the patient, or&#xD;
      the investigator decides to discontinue treatment, whichever comes first. The time of study&#xD;
      drug administration should be recorded in the patient diary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will attend study visits on Days 0, 28, 56 and 84. The following procedures will be&#xD;
      performed according to the schedule of assessments: physical examination, vital signs,&#xD;
      performance status, clinical laboratory tests, adverse events (AEs), concomitant medication&#xD;
      and patient compliance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Scores assessments will be performed at Screening, Day 28, Day 56 and Day 84 including EASI&#xD;
      score, SCORAD, sIGA score, BSA affected by atopic dermatitis and pruritus verbal rating&#xD;
      scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary endpoint is the percentage improvement between baseline and week 12 in Eczema&#xD;
      Area and Severity Index (EASI).&#xD;

             the patient's participation in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Subjects with prosthetic heart valves, pacemakers, intravascular catheters, or other&#xD;
             foreign or prosthetic devices.&#xD;
&#xD;
