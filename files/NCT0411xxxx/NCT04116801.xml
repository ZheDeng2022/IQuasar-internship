      Few studies have evaluated the use of fluorescein sodium for the resection of brain tumours&#xD;
      (especially glioblastomas) but also cerebral metastases. We therefore propose to evaluate the&#xD;
      technique of fluorescence guided microsurgery (fluorescein sodium) compared to the&#xD;
      conventional microsurgical technique in the resection of cerebral metastases in adults in&#xD;
      order to specify, by a prospective and randomised study, the assistance provided by this&#xD;
      technique in the quality of resection and the gain in terms of overall survival and local&#xD;
      control of brain disease.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cerebral metastases are a major public health problem in cancer patients. They are the most&#xD;
      common brain tumours in adults. It is estimated that approximately 20-40% of patients with&#xD;
      primary malignant neoplasia will develop cerebral metastasis during the course of their&#xD;
      illness. In addition, the incidence of brain metastases is increasing due, in particular, to&#xD;
      the aging of the population, as well as to the improvement of the overall management of&#xD;
      cancer patients (cytotoxic or targeted systemic treatment) and easier access to magnetic&#xD;
      resonance imaging (MRI), which improves patient survival. The prognosis of patients with&#xD;
      brain metastases is still poor and the median overall survival of these patients is of the&#xD;
      order of a few months. Although the management of brain metastases is multidisciplinary, the&#xD;
      benefit of surgery has been clearly demonstrated in the literature. Consequently, it is&#xD;
      demonstrated that the quality of the tumour excision and in particular the carrying out of&#xD;
      the complete excision of contrast enhancement on the MRI is correlated with improved overall&#xD;
      survival (especially in case of single metastasis) and improved local control of the disease&#xD;
      or progression-free survival, but also a better quality of life. It is therefore essential to&#xD;
      perform the most complete excision possible while minimising the associated morbidity. For&#xD;
      this purpose, various tools for surgical resection have been developed and are available,&#xD;
      including intraoperative fluorescence guided surgery. Sodium fluorescein is a fluorochrome&#xD;
      that accumulates, after intravenous injection, into vascularised tumour tissues and is&#xD;
      revealed intraoperatively by a light source of suitable wavelength (560 nm) using a set of&#xD;
      lenses included in the microscope. The resection is thus guided by this fluorescence, the&#xD;
      complete disappearance of which will translate into a complete tumour resection. Its interest&#xD;
      is twofold: to increase the percentage of complete tumour resection and to improve survival&#xD;
      without recurrence and overall survival.Few studies have evaluated the use of fluorescein&#xD;
      sodium for the resection of brain tumours (especially glioblastomas) but also cerebral&#xD;
      metastases. If two studies on brain metastases showed a complete resection rate greater than&#xD;
      80% and a better rate of local control of brain disease, it is important to note that these&#xD;
      studies were not randomised (with a control arm), they did not really prove the effectiveness&#xD;
      of this technique under fluorescence, hence the need to set up a randomised study. We&#xD;
      therefore propose to evaluate the technique of fluorescence guided microsurgery (fluorescein&#xD;
      sodium) compared to the conventional microsurgical technique in the resection of cerebral&#xD;
      metastases in adults in order to specify, by a prospective and randomised study, the&#xD;
      assistance provided by this technique in the quality of resection and the gain in terms of&#xD;
      overall survival and local control of brain disease.&#xD;
