  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to collect safety and effectiveness data for the&#xD;
      Technolas Teneo 317 Model 2 excimer laser for LASIK correction in participants with myopia&#xD;
      and myopic astigmatism.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Technolas TENEO 317 Model 2 excimer laser is a scanning excimer laser that operates at 193 nm&#xD;
      ultraviolet wavelength to photoablate corneal tissue in order to achieve a refractive change.&#xD;
      It is planned to enroll and treat up to 334 participant eyes, with an expectation that 300&#xD;
      study eyes will complete post-surgical follow-up for 6 months or until the point of achieved&#xD;
      refractive stability. When a cohort of at least 300 eyes has achieved refractive stability at&#xD;
      6 months post-surgery, all other treated eyes that have not reached the 6-month examination&#xD;
      may be discontinued at the Sponsor's request. Or, if 300 eyes achieve refractive stability at&#xD;
      9 months post-surgery, all other treated eyes that have not reached the 9-month examination&#xD;
      may be discontinued&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Have manifest distance best spectacle corrected visual acuity (BSCVA) of 20/25&#xD;

             eye.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have equal to or less than 0.50 D spherical equivalent (SE) difference between&#xD;
             cycloplegic and manifest refractions at Visit 1 (pre-operative).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have normal corneal topography as determined by the Investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;

             lenses) or 3 days (for soft contact lenses) prior to the pre-operative examination,&#xD;
             and through the day of surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  All contact lens wearers must demonstrate a stable refraction (within ±0.5 D), as&#xD;
             determined by MRSE, on 2 consecutive examinations at least 1 week apart, in an eye to&#xD;
             be treated and the axis of cylinder should not differ by more than 15 degrees from the&#xD;
             baseline cycloplegic refraction.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Participants for whom the combination of their baseline corneal thickness and the&#xD;
             planned operative parameters for the LASIK procedure would result in treatment depth&#xD;
             less than 250 microns from corneal endothelium.&#xD;
&#xD;
