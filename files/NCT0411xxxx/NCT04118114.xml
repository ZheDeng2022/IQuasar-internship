  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase II, open-label, single dose level study of PRL3-ZUMAB monotherapy in patients&#xD;
      with advanced solid tumours that have failed standard therapy. Approximately 30 patients will&#xD;
      be recruited with ~10 gastric cancers and ~10 hepatocellular carcinomas. Patients who have&#xD;
      received at least 1 dose of PRL3-ZUMAB will be evaluable for toxicity and efficacy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PRL3-ZUMAB will be given IV every 2 weeks for up to 12 infusions in the absence of&#xD;
      unmanageable toxicities or disease progression. Patients who are benefitting from the&#xD;
      treatment may continue on PRL3-ZUMAB beyond 12 infusions with the agreement of the study drug&#xD;
      provider.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PRL3-ZUMAB at the RP2D in tumour types enriched for known PRL-3 expression for efficacy and&#xD;
      tolerability will be evaluated. There will also be in depth molecular profiling of tissues in&#xD;
      patients who have an objective response or prolonged disease stabilization to identify&#xD;
      predictive/selection biomarkers as well as evaluation of the oncogenic signaling modulation&#xD;
      and immunomodulation by PRL3-ZUMAB and its potential for future combination with other&#xD;
      targeted therapies or immunotherapy.&#xD;
