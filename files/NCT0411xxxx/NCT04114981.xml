  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase III trial studies how well single fraction stereotactic radiosurgery works&#xD;
      compared with fractionated stereotactic radiosurgery in treating patients with cancer that&#xD;
      has spread to the brain from other parts of the body and has been removed by surgery. Single&#xD;
      fraction stereotactic radiosurgery is a specialized radiation therapy that delivers a single,&#xD;
      high dose of radiation directly to the tumor and may cause less damage to normal tissue.&#xD;
      Fractionated stereotactic radiosurgery delivers multiple, smaller doses of radiation therapy&#xD;
      over time. This study may help doctors find out if fractionated stereotactic radiosurgery is&#xD;
      better or worse than the usual approach with single fraction stereotactic radiosurgery.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To ascertain if time to surgical bed failure is increased with fractionated stereotactic&#xD;
      radiosurgery (FSRS) compared to single-fraction stereotactic radiosurgery (SSRS) in patients&#xD;
      with resected brain metastasis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To ascertain if there is better emotional well-being at 9 months as assessed by the&#xD;
      Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Brain (FACT-BR) in patients with resected brain&#xD;
      metastasis undergoing FSRS compared to SSRS (Primary quality of life [QOL] objective).&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To ascertain whether there is improved overall survival in patients with resected brain&#xD;
      metastases who undergo FSRS compared to patients who receive SSRS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To ascertain in patients with resected brain metastases whether there is improved&#xD;
      overall QOL as assessed by the FACT-BR and Linear Analog Self-Assessment (LASA) in patients&#xD;
      who receive FSRS compared to patients who receive SSRS (Secondary QOL objective).&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To compare the functional independence in patients who receive FSRS to patients who&#xD;
      receive SSRS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. To tabulate and descriptively compare the post-treatment adverse events associated with&#xD;
      the interventions, including the potential impact of immunotherapy and targeted therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VI. To compare rates of radiation necrosis at 12 months in patients who receive FSRS to&#xD;
      patients who receive SSRS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VII. To evaluate if there is any difference in central nervous system (CNS) failure patterns&#xD;
      (local, distant brain failure, local leptomeningeal disease, widespread leptomeningeal&#xD;
      disease) in patients who receive FSRS compared to patients who receive SSRS after resection&#xD;
      of brain metastasis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VIII. To ascertain in patients with resected brain metastases whether there is increased time&#xD;
      to whole-brain radiotherapy (WBRT) in patients who receive FSRS compared to patients who&#xD;
      receive SSRS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IX. To determine in long-term survivors (patients who are alive more than 12 months from time&#xD;
      of randomization) whether there is better emotional well-being and overall QOL as assessed by&#xD;
      the FACT-BR and LASA in patients who receive FSRS to the surgical bed compared to patients&#xD;
      who receive SSRS (Secondary QOL objective).&#xD;
&#xD;
      X. To assess for differences in CNS failure patterns (surgical, local, distant brain failure,&#xD;
      leptomeningeal disease) as well as radiation necrosis rates as assessed by central review in&#xD;
      patients who receive FSRS compared to patients who receive SSRS after resection of a brain&#xD;
      metastasis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      XI. To ascertain in patients with resected brain metastases whether there is improved QOL as&#xD;
      assessed by all other total and individual FACT-BR and LASA items and subscale values in&#xD;
      patients who receive FSRS compared to patients who receive SSRS (Exploratory QOL objective).&#xD;
&#xD;
      XII. To determine in patients with resected brain metastases whether there is less cognitive&#xD;
      progression in patients who receive FSRS to the surgical bed compared to patients who receive&#xD;
      SSRS (Exploratory cognitive objective).&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM I: Patients undergo SSRS over 1 session.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM II: Patients undergo FSRS over 3 or 5 daily sessions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study, patients are followed up at 30 days, at 3, 6, 9, 12, 16, and 24&#xD;
      months, then every 6 months until 5 years from randomization.&#xD;

    <description>Surgical bed control is defined as the absence of new nodular contrast enhancement in the surgical bed. In other words, a surgical bed recurrence-free survival (SB-RFS) event is defined as radiographic evidence of a new contrast-enhancing lesion (specifically any new progressive enhancing nodularity) at the site of the surgical resection. Will use a stratified log-rank test that compares and will report the median SB-RFS times between the single fraction stereotactic radiosurgery (SSRS) and fractionated stereotactic radiosurgery (FSRS) arms while adjusting for the stratification factors.</description>

          -  Resection cavity must measure &lt; 5.0 cm in maximal extent and the resection must be&#xD;
             complete (gross total resection) on the post-operative MRI obtained =&lt; 30 days prior&#xD;
             to pre-registration.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Karnofsky performance status of &gt;= 60.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  For women of childbearing potential only, a negative urine or serum pregnancy test&#xD;

&#xD;
               -  Men and women of childbearing potential must be willing to employ adequate&#xD;
                  contraception throughout the study and for men for up to 3 months after&#xD;
                  completing treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  A female of childbearing potential is a sexually mature female who: 1) has not&#xD;
                  undergone a hysterectomy or bilateral oophorectomy; or 2) has not been naturally&#xD;
                  postmenopausal for at least 12 consecutive months (i.e., has had menses at any&#xD;
                  time in the preceding 12 consecutive months).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ability to complete an MRI of the head with contrast.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The brain metastasis must be located &gt; 5 mm of the optic chiasm; the brain metastasis&#xD;
             must be located outside the brainstem (i.e. not inside the brainstem).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Must not have any prior whole brain radiation therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Past radiosurgery to other lesions is allowed.&#xD;
&#xD;
             o NOTE: The surgically resected lesion cannot be the same location treated in the past&#xD;
             with radiosurgery (i.e. repeat radiosurgery to the same location/lesion is not allowed&#xD;
             on this protocol).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  May not have primary germ cell tumor, small cell carcinoma, or lymphoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  No evidence of leptomeningeal metastasis (LMD).&#xD;
&#xD;
             o NOTE: For the purposes of exclusion, LMD is a clinical diagnosis, defined as&#xD;
             positive cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) cytology and/or equivocal radiologic or clinical&#xD;
             evidence of leptomeningeal involvement. Patients with leptomeningeal symptoms in the&#xD;
             setting of leptomeningeal enhancement by imaging (MRI) would be considered to have LMD&#xD;
             even in the absence of positive CSF cytology, unless a parenchymal lesion can&#xD;
             adequately explain the neurologic symptoms and/or signs. In contrast, an asymptomatic&#xD;
             or minimally symptomatic patient with mild or nonspecific leptomeningeal enhancement&#xD;
             (MRI) would not be considered to have LMD. In that patient, CSF sampling is not&#xD;
             required to formally exclude LMD, but can be performed at the investigator's&#xD;
             discretion based on level of clinical suspicion.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Must be fluent in English, Spanish, or French.&#xD;
&#xD;
        REGISTRATION:&#xD;
&#xD;
        • Completion of all baseline electronic patient-reported outcome (ePRO) quality of life&#xD;
        measures (or booklet quality of life measures) and Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA).&#xD;
