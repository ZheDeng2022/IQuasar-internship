  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Meningioma, an extra-axial brain tumor developed at the expense of meninges, accounts for 35%&#xD;
      of central nervous system tumors, and its incidence is estimated at 3% in large autopsy&#xD;
      series.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The current gold standard for screening and monitoring cerebral meningiomas is MRI with&#xD;
      injection of gadoline-contrast product. However, the use of some of these products is&#xD;
      problematic, due to gadolinium deposits observed in patients who have had several injections&#xD;
      during their lifetime, especially in patients followed for multiple sclerosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently, the French National Agency for the Safety of Medicines and Health Products (ANSM)&#xD;
      issued recommendations concerning the screening of meningiomas in patients at risk,&#xD;
      particularly in people treated with cyproterone acetate. It is a synthetic progestogen&#xD;
      steroid with anti-androgenic properties. It is used to treat hyperandrogenic syndromes in&#xD;
      women or in the palliative treatment of prostate cancer in men. Its long-term use seems to be&#xD;
      associated with a significant over-risk of developing meningiomas, brain tumours affecting&#xD;
      meninges. This increased risk is multiplied by 7 in women exposed to high doses of&#xD;
      cyproterone acetate, and by 20 over a cumulative dose of 60 grams, or about 5 years of&#xD;
      treatment at 50 mg/day or 10 years at 25 mg/day. The ANSM recommends that a cerebral MRI be&#xD;
      performed at the beginning of treatment for all patients, as well as a control MRI renewed at&#xD;
      5 years and then every 2 years if the MRI at 5 years is normal. These recommendations will&#xD;
      lead to a large number of MRIs involving an injection of contrast agent in this population,&#xD;
      with potential immediate or delayed serious adverse effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      New techniques, such as Arterial Spin Labelling (ASL), or black blood sequences optimized for&#xD;
      contrast detection, have been developed. These could detect meningeal anomalies and more&#xD;
      particularly meningiomas without contrast injection, or with a significantly lower dose of&#xD;
      contrast agent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These techniques have not been specifically studied for screening or monitoring meningeal&#xD;
      lesions, but it seems relevant and important to be able to validate protocols that reduce&#xD;
      gadolinium doses given the high number of screening and follow-up MRIs in the general&#xD;
      population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients presenting for brain MRI for meningioma screening or follow-up will have the usual&#xD;
      MRI sequences for their management, and the FABIR sequences without injection, added for&#xD;
      research. These new sequences will add approximately 8 minutes of additional examination&#xD;
      time.&#xD;
