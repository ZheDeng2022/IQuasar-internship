  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the mechanistic basis for the analgesic effects of GSK3858279 in&#xD;
      humans by using a battery of experimental pain assessments in healthy participants. This will&#xD;
      be placebo-controlled, three-period two-treatment crossover study. In each period,&#xD;
      participants will receive either GSK3858279 or placebo in a 1:1 ratio. Only healthy male&#xD;
      participants will be enrolled into the study. The duration of the study will be approximately&#xD;
      6 months.&#xD;

    <measure>Time to intolerable pain threshold by cold pressor pain method at Day 1</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1</time_frame>
    <description>Time to intolerable pain threshold will be assessed by cold pressor pain method. In this method, participants will place their non-dominant hand into a water bath (35 ± 0.5 degree Celsius). After 2 minutes, participant will then move their hand from the warm water bath, directly placing their hand into a similar sized bath (1.0 ± 0.5 degree Celsius). The participants will be instructed to indicate when pain detection threshold is reached; first change in sensation from cold non-painful to painful and the increase in pain intensity. This endpoint will look at the pain tolerance on when it is no longer tolerable (Electronic Visual Analogue Scale [eVAS] slider at 100 millimeters [mm]) or when a time limit (120 seconds) is reached.</description>
