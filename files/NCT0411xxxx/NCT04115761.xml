      This study is designed with open-label and randomized parallel group to evaluate the efficacy&#xD;
      and safety of autologous dendritic cell vaccination (ADCV01) as an add-on treatment for&#xD;
      primary glioblastoma multiforme&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The patients with primary glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) have high mortality and morbidity.&#xD;
      Even with best conventional therapy (surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy), the most of&#xD;
      median survivals are less than 2 years. The one-year progression-free survival (PFS) is less&#xD;
      than 20%. Recently, the immune therapy is a new promising therapy for GBM from the evidences&#xD;
      of published experimental data and clinical trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, the outcomes of immune therapy are still equivocal. The critical point of immune&#xD;
      therapy is strongly influenced by tumor microenvironment. Up to now, for example, immune&#xD;
      checkpoint inhibitor such as programmed cell death protein ligand 1 (PD-L1) and programmed&#xD;
      cell death protein 1 (PD-1) was found to induce exhaustion of CD8 T cell by of PD-1/PD-L1&#xD;
      reaction. Unfortunately, GBM cells always have high PD-L1 expression. It means the higher&#xD;
      PD-1 level of T-cell indicates the higher immune suppression by GBM tumor cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the investigators preclinical study, the best murine survival was found to be the&#xD;
      combination outcome of dendritic cell (DC) with anti-PD-1 therapy which was better than that&#xD;
      of DC therapy only. From previously ADCV-treated patients, the median of PD-1/CD8 was 0.21.&#xD;
      When the PD-1/CD8 ratio less than 0.21, this patient is defined as with low PD-1 level.&#xD;
&#xD;
      From the investigators previous experience, patients with low PD-1/CD8 ratio had far better&#xD;
      2-year overall survival (OS) than patients with high PD-1/CD8 ratio in ADCV treatment. On the&#xD;
      other hand, it showed that OS and PFS had significant reverse correlation with PD-1 level of&#xD;
      Tcell during DC immunotherapy. Considering the needs and benefit of patients, the new&#xD;
      autologous dendritic cell vaccine (ADCV01) is proposed to be added on conventional therapy in&#xD;
      low PD-1 expressed GBM patients and evaluate its safety and efficacy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, only newly diagnosed primary GBM (wild-type Isocitrate Dehydrogenase 1, IDH-1)&#xD;
      patients will be enrolled in this clinical trial. In addition to fulfilling all inclusion&#xD;
      criteria without matching any of the exclusion criteria, patients will undergo tumor&#xD;
      resection and less than 25% of residual tumor size, followed by being subjected to&#xD;
      histological analysis. Examinations of molecular diagnostics including IDH-1 for confirmation&#xD;
      of IDH-1 wild-type GBM according to the 2016 WHO Classification of Tumors of the Central&#xD;
      Nervous System, and cut-off criteria for expression levels of PD-1 and CD8 (PD-1/CD8 ratio&#xD;
      less than 0.21) will be screened for the eligibility to participate in this study and MGMT&#xD;
      status will also be determined.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After tumor resection, all eligible patients will receive standard radiotherapy (RT) plus&#xD;
      Temozolomide (Temodal, TMZ), followed by adjuvant treatment of TMZ. Patients assigned to the&#xD;
      investigational group will receive ADCV01 administration as an add-on treatment after&#xD;
      operation in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aims to treat eligible patients with ADCV01 as an add-on immunotherapy along with&#xD;
      post-surgery GBM treatment and compare the treatment to the conventional therapy (RT plus&#xD;
      standard TMZ chemotherapy) alone on the basis of PFS in an unbalanced allocation&#xD;
      (investigational group : control group = 2:1). After tumor resection, patients assigned to&#xD;
      the control group will receive RT plus TMZ, followed by the scheduled evaluation visits. For&#xD;
      patients assigned to the investigational drug group, a standard of 10 doses of ADCV01 (2±0.5&#xD;
      × 10^7 cell/dose) in addition to conventional therapy will be administered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The assessment of tumor response is based on [Update Response Assessment Criteria for&#xD;
      High-Grade Gliomas, Response Assessment in Neuro-Oncology (RANO)] assessed by the on-site&#xD;
      investigator and Blinded Independent Central Review (BICR) independently. If needed, the&#xD;
      repeat operation for decompressive craniotomy evaluated by the on-site neurosurgeon for&#xD;
      relief of increased intracerebral pressure (IICP), or for lifesaving will be allowed in both&#xD;
      groups. However, in this study, the reoperation for recurrent tumor will be allowed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RT will be given if feasible considering the total RT accumulatively given is not enough when&#xD;
      tumor recurs (total dose 60 Gy). Gamma knife will not be used for recurrent tumor in this&#xD;
      study which is different application from previous research.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Regardless of receiving re-operation or not in both groups, TMZ treatment will be shifted to&#xD;
      anti-angiogenic therapy (AVASTIN®) 10 mg/kg/2weeks for 6 doses after patients have recurrence&#xD;
      of GBM. Pseudo-progression may lead to either premature termination of therapy or unnecessary&#xD;
      debulking surgeries. Therefore, adjuvant TMZ is recommended to be continued for a minimum of&#xD;
      3 cycles (along with ADCV01 treatment in the first 3 months of the adjuvant TMZ period),&#xD;
      after which other imaging techniques (e.g., Gdenhancing MRI and proton magnetic resonance&#xD;
      spectroscopy) should be used to ascertain progression. TMZ is not continuously used whenever&#xD;
      recurrence. On this end, the treatment course is complete.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the recurrent GBM in patients assigned to the investigational group is occurred before&#xD;
      completing 10 doses of ADCV01 treatments, the patient will be treated by the remaining ADCV01&#xD;
      and complete the originally scheduled treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this phase II study, 24 eligible primary GBM patients who are with low PD-1/CD8 ratio will&#xD;
      be recruited. There will be 16 patients with combination of ADCV01 and conventional therapy,&#xD;
      and 8 patients with conventional therapy only. In this trial, the treatment efficacy of&#xD;
      ADCV01 measured by one-year PFS rate will be evaluated at the end of phase II study. Because&#xD;
      PFS was surrogate endpoint of overall survival in GBM by literature-based meta-analysis from&#xD;
      91 clinical trials, the 1-year PFS rate will be the primary endpoint of GBM clinical trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is designed with open-label and randomized parallel group. To date, 34 clinical&#xD;
      trials of DC for GBM published up to 2017 in ClinicalTrials.gov, there are 5/34 trials&#xD;
      designed by double blinded method and 2/34 trials by single blinded and most of 27/34 trials&#xD;
      by open-label (please see ref. ClinicalTrials.gov). The other reason for open-label is that&#xD;
      the apheresis for control patients is an invasive procedure. GBM is a not easily curable&#xD;
      disease; patients with MGMT methylation have a better survival than with unmethylation. In&#xD;
      this trial, MGMT status will be evaluated in all tumor specimens for further subgroup&#xD;
      analysis.&#xD;
