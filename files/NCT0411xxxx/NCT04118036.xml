    <textblock>
      This research study is studying a combination therapy as a possible treatment for recurrent&#xD;
      glioblastoma (GBM), a brain tumor that is growing or progressing despite earlier treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will involve participants with recurrent glioblastoma at their first relapse&#xD;
      enrolled in two arms including patients who require reoperation and patients not requiring&#xD;
      surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This research study involves a combination of two drugs:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pembrolizumab (MK3475)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Abemaciclib (LY2835219)&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This research study is a Phase II clinical trial. Phase II clinical trials test the safety&#xD;
      and effectiveness of an investigational drug to learn whether the drug works in treating a&#xD;
      specific disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      &quot;Investigational&quot; means that the drug is being studied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Many brain cancers show over expression of a protein called cyclin D1. That means that the&#xD;
      body makes too much cyclin D1, which affects enzymes called CDK 4 and CDK 6. Enzymes are&#xD;
      substances in the body that help reactions between cells happen. Too much cyclin D1 triggers&#xD;
      CDK 4 and CDK 6 to make more cells than normal. This extra cell production leads to the&#xD;
      growth of tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In laboratory studies, abemaciclib was able to enter the brain, stop CDK 4 and CDK 6 from&#xD;
      making cells, and slow growth of glioblastoma in mice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pembrolizumab (MK-3475) has been studied in lab experiments and in other types of cancer.&#xD;
      Information from these studies suggests that Pembrolizumab (MK-3475) may be beneficial&#xD;
      inrecurrent glioblastoma (GBM). Pembrolizumab (MK-3475) is a humanized monoclonal antibody.&#xD;
      An antibody is a common type of protein made in the body in response to a foreign substance.&#xD;
      Antibodies attack foreign substances and protect against infection. Antibodies can also be&#xD;
      produced in the laboratory for use in treating patients; an antibody that is made in the lab&#xD;
      is also known as a humanized monoclonal antibody that is designed to block the action of the&#xD;
      receptor, PD-1. PD-1 works to help tumor cells continue to grow and multiply. There are now&#xD;
      several approved antibodies for the therapy of cancer and other diseases.&#xD;

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  All participants must meet the following criteria on screening examination to be&#xD;
             eligible to participate in the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Participants must be able to understand and willing to sign a written informed&#xD;
                  consent document.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Participants must be able to adhere to the dosing and visit schedules, and agree&#xD;
                  to record medication times accurately and consistently in a daily diary.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Participants must be at least 18 years old on day of signing informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Participants must have a Karnofsky Performance Status (KPS) ≥ 70 (see Appendix&#xD;
                  A).&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Participants must be able to swallow oral medications.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Nature of illness and treatment history&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Participants must have histologically confirmed diagnosis of glioblastoma or&#xD;
                  variants. Participants will not be eligible if the prior diagnosis was low-grade&#xD;
                  glioma and a subsequent histological diagnosis of glioblastoma or variants was&#xD;
                  made (e.g. secondary GBM).&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  To be eligible for the study all participants (Cohort 1 and 2) are required to&#xD;
                  provide genomic profiling data from a sequencing-based assay and must include&#xD;
                  reporting of the RB1 gene in explicit terms within the report. Only sequencing&#xD;
                  assays that include coverage of all exons of the RB1 gene are able to be utilized&#xD;
                  (most commonly called a targeted exome assay; e.g. Oncopanel, Impact,&#xD;
                  FoundationOne). In addition, patients must provide a report of copy assessment&#xD;
                  which reports status of RB1. The reporting may be from a copy array (ideally&#xD;
                  Oncoscan SNP array or Agilent array CGH) or can also be from sequencing assay if&#xD;
                  copy status is explicitly provided with quantitative information regarding the&#xD;
                  status of relevant genes.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Inactivation of CDKN2A/B or C in the tumor by homozygous deletion (evidence for&#xD;
                  more than single copy loss for any of the genes defined as copy array log2 ratio&#xD;
                  of &lt;0.3 by copy array; or from sequencing data with sufficient coverage for&#xD;
                  evaluation). Rearrangement/evidence or intragenic breaks by copy or sequencing&#xD;
                  assay also will be considered eligible for study (any copy status).&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Validation of wild-type RB status (no deletion/losses more than single copy by&#xD;
                  copy number or sequencing data; and/or no inactivating mutations or rearrangement&#xD;
                  by sequencing).&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Participants must be at first relapse of GBM. Relapse is defined as progression&#xD;
                  following initial therapy (i.e. radiation +/- chemo if that was used as initial&#xD;
                  therapy). The intent therefore is that patients had no more than 1 prior therapy&#xD;
                  (initial treatment). If the patient had a surgical resection for relapsed disease&#xD;
                  and no anti-cancer therapy was instituted for up to 12 weeks, and the patient&#xD;
                  undergoes another surgical resection, this is considered to constitute 1 relapse.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Participants must have shown unequivocal evidence for tumor progression by MRI or&#xD;
                  CT scan.&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  For Cohort 2 subjects, CT or MRI within 14 days prior to study registration.&#xD;
                       For Cohort 2, corticosteroid dose must be stable or decreasing for at least&#xD;
                       5 days prior to the scan. If steroids are added or the steroid dose is&#xD;
                       increased between the date of the screening MRI or CT scan and the start of&#xD;
                       treatment, a new baseline MRI or CT is required.&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  For Cohort 1 subjects, CT or MRI should be performed ideally within 14 days&#xD;
                       prior to study registration, but because the screening MRI for this subset&#xD;
                       of subjects will not be used for evaluation of response, it is acceptable&#xD;
                       for this MRI/CT to have been performed greater than 14 days prior to&#xD;
                       registration if unavoidable. Furthermore, for this same reason, fluctuation&#xD;
                       in corticosteroid dose around this MRI does not warrant repeat scan so long&#xD;
                       as there is documented unequivocal evidence of tumor progression available.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Confirmation of availability of sufficient tissue from a prior surgery&#xD;
                  demonstrating glioblastoma or variants for correlative studies is required prior&#xD;
                  to enrollment; these samples must be sent to the DFCI Coordinating Center within&#xD;
                  60 days of registration.&#xD;
&#xD;
        The following archived tissue is required for Cohort 2 patients:&#xD;
&#xD;
        --- 20 unstained formalin fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) sections (standard 5 micrometer&#xD;
        thickness).&#xD;
&#xD;
        The following amount of archived tissue is required for Cohort 1 patients:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  20 unstained formalin fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) sections (standard 5 micrometer&#xD;
             thickness)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  For Cohort 1 subjects, there must be &gt; 2cm2 enhancing tissue available for resection&#xD;
             and submission for study correlatives as determined by local treating team. NOTE: if&#xD;
             the above-mentioned tissue is not available from the most recent surgery revealing&#xD;
             GBM, participants may be enrolled with tissue available from any prior surgery&#xD;
             revealing GBM with prospective approval from the Overall PI. An interval of at least&#xD;
             12 weeks from the completion of radiation therapy to start of study drug unless there&#xD;
             is a new area of enhancement consistent with recurrent tumor outside the radiation&#xD;
             field (defined as the region outside the high-dose region or 80% isodose line) or&#xD;
             there is unequivocal histologic confirmation of tumor progression.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Participants must have recovered to grade 0 or 1 or pre-treatment baseline from&#xD;
                  clinically significant toxic effects of prior therapy (including but not limited&#xD;
                  to exceptions of alopecia, laboratory values listed per inclusion criteria, and&#xD;
                  lymphopenia which is common after therapy with temozolomide).&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  From the projected start of scheduled study treatment, the following time periods&#xD;
                  must have elapsed:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  4 weeks or 5 half-lives (whichever is shorter) from any investigational agent;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  4 weeks from cytotoxic therapy (except 23 days for temozolomide; 6 weeks from&#xD;
             nitrosoureas);&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  4 weeks from antibodies;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  4 weeks or 5 half-lives (whichever is shorter) from other anti-tumor therapies.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  2 days from Novo-TTF&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Participants with prior therapy that included interstitial brachytherapy or&#xD;
                  stereotactic radiosurgery must have confirmation of progressive disease based&#xD;
                  upon nuclear imaging, MR spectroscopy, perfusion imaging or histopathology.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Participants having undergone recent resection or open biopsy or stereotactic&#xD;
                  biopsy of recurrent or progressive tumor will be eligible for Cohort 2 as long as&#xD;
                  the following conditions apply:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  They have recovered from the effects of surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Residual disease following resection of recurrent tumor is not mandated for&#xD;
             eligibility.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Clinical labs - performed within 14 days prior to registration&#xD;
