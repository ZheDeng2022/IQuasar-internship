    <textblock>
      The objective of this randomized controlled trial is to compare the effect of flywheel&#xD;
      resistance exercise versus free weight high load low velocity resistance exercise, where both&#xD;
      modalities are carried out in a squat exercise with maximal intended mobilization of force&#xD;
      contractions and combined with football practices, on 10 meter sprint, countermovement jump&#xD;
      (CMJ) and one repeition maximum (1RM) partial 90° range of motion (ROM) squat strength in&#xD;
      football players. The investigators 1) hypothesize that resistance exercise using flywheels&#xD;
      and barbell free weights (BFW) combined with football practices will equally improve sprint&#xD;
      time and jump height, and 2) the investigators hypothesize that squats carried out in a BFW&#xD;
      exercise will result in superior improvements in 1RM partial squat compared with flywheel&#xD;
      squats.&#xD;

      The investigators will aim at recruiting 45 recreationally active football players, that will&#xD;
      be randomly allocated to three groups: 1) flywheel (FW) group (n=15), 2) barbell free weight&#xD;
      (BFW) group (n=15) and 3) control group (n=15).The FW and the BFW group will participate in&#xD;
      an intervention where they perform a squat exercise either with a FW device or with BFWs&#xD;
      twice a week over six weeks (in total 12 sessions) as a part of their preseason preparations.&#xD;
      The control group will be instructed to not perform lower body resistance exercise and only&#xD;
      to perform their teams' preseason preparations and acted as controls. During the intervention&#xD;
      period, all players in all groups will be instructed to avoid other resistance exercises for&#xD;
      their lower body, while no restrictions will be given in regard to resistance exercises for&#xD;
      their upper body in their spare time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will be carried out in accordance with international ethical standards for sport&#xD;
      and exercise science and to the Declaration of Helsinki; prior to pre-tests, all the players&#xD;
      will be informed of the purpose of the study and its associated risks and benefits, before&#xD;
      providing oral and written informed consent. The Norwegian Data Protection Service has&#xD;
      approved the study and the storage of personal data (Approval reference number: 374030). No&#xD;
      further Regional Ethical approval per applicable institutional and national guidelines for&#xD;
      sport and exercise science.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior to the interventions, the players will undergo pre-tests in the following order on the&#xD;
      same test day: 1) 10 meter sprint time, 2) CMJ and 3) 1RM in a free barbell partial squat,&#xD;
      carried out as 90° ROM in the knee joint (standing position = 180°).&#xD;
&#xD;
      10 meter sprint: The 10 meter sprint test will be performed on artificial grass indoors.&#xD;
      Photocells mounted to the floor and walls recorded the sprint times, where the photocells at&#xD;
      the starting and the finishing line are placed 20 cm and 100 cm above the ground,&#xD;
      respectively. A marker is placed 30 cm behind of the starting timing gate, where the players&#xD;
      chose their starting position behind the marker. The players starts their test on their own&#xD;
      initiative, and without verbal encouragement, by breaking the laser beam at the starting&#xD;
      timing gate and sprinted to the finishing line as fast as they can. Each player is given&#xD;
      three attempts with three minutes recovery between each sprint.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Countermovement jump:&#xD;
&#xD;
      the players will test their jump height with a countermovement jump on a force platform that&#xD;
      measures the vertical jump height in centimetres (cm) by calculating the centre of mass&#xD;
      displacement from force development (take-off velocity) and body mass. Starting from an&#xD;
      upright standing position with their feet shoulder-width apart and with both hands placed on&#xD;
      their hips, the players will make a preliminary downward movement (eccentric phase) by&#xD;
      flexing their hips and knees to approximately 90° (knee-flexion) before performing the&#xD;
      concentric phase of the vertical jump off the ground by extending the knees and the hips,&#xD;
      respectively. Each player is given three attempts with three minutes recovery between each&#xD;
      jump.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One repetition maximum in squat:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following the jump test, the players will perform a one repetition maximum (1RM) partial&#xD;
      range of motion (90° knee joint angle) back squat test using an Olympic barbell. The players&#xD;
      will warm up by lifting the Olympic barbell (20 kg) without additional weights for 8-10&#xD;
      repetitions, and thereafter perform two sets of progressively decreasing repetitions (6 and 3&#xD;
      repetitions, respectively) and increasing the weights based on their perceived effort in the&#xD;
      previous warmup set. Thereafter, the players attempts their 1RM trials with increasing&#xD;
      weights (2.5-10 kg) until failure. Failure is defined as inability to lift the barbell to&#xD;
      standing (starting) position (180° knee joint angle). A goniometer will be held to the&#xD;
      lateral part of their knee joint by an instructor to ensure that the players reach 90° of&#xD;
      knee flexion before they are given a verbal &quot;go&quot; and they can start the concentric phase of&#xD;
      the lift. The kilograms (kg) lifted in the last approved set is considered their 1RM and&#xD;
      recorded in kg.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exercise interventions Over the course of the interventions, all players in all three groups&#xD;
      will be instructed to adhere to their two-three weekly football practices and preseason&#xD;
      matches of their team (~one weekly match). The players in the FW and BFW groups start their&#xD;
      exercise interventions the week following pre-tests. All intervention sessions were performed&#xD;
      in the same laboratory and supervised by the same instructor. The players in both&#xD;
      intervention groups are expected to experience a large increase in 1RM partial squat strength&#xD;
      and thus a predominant increase in quadriceps muscle force is expectable with respects to&#xD;
      hamstrings force. Therefore, the players will also perform the Nordic hamstring exercise to&#xD;
      avoid a large quadriceps-to-hamstring strength ratio and thereby potentially reduce the risk&#xD;
      for hamstring strains.The Nordic hamstring exercise will be performed at the end of each&#xD;
      exercise session (for both interventions) and involve three sets of four repetitions (week 1)&#xD;
      where the number of repetitions is progressively increasing to five in week 2, six in week&#xD;
      3-4, eight in week 5, and 10 in the final week of the interventions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Flywheel group:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The players allocated to the FW group will be equipped with a west around their upper body&#xD;
      connected with a band to the FW device (#215 YoYo Squat Unlimited Pro, nHance, YOYO&#xD;
      Technology, Stockholm, Sweden). The players start in a deep squat position (~120° knee&#xD;
      angle), and perform at first a standardized warmup set with six repetitions using the #1&#xD;
      inertia FW (0.025 kg·m-2). Thereafter, the players perform their maximal intended&#xD;
      mobilization of force contraction sets by starting with three slow repetitions to allow the&#xD;
      players to get into the flow of the squat exercise movement, where they will be given a&#xD;
      verbal &quot;go&quot; when starting to push with maximal intended mobilization of force from deep squat&#xD;
      starting position to standing position. The band connecting the west and the FW device will&#xD;
      be strapped tightly making the players stop at 175° knee joint angle in the standing position&#xD;
      when the FW band is unwound. When the FW continues to rewind again and produces kinetic force&#xD;
      in the pivoting shaft, this immediately will force the players to bend their knees and begin&#xD;
      the eccentric contraction phase. The players are instructed to over-win the kinetic energy&#xD;
      with the highest possible mobilization of muscular force, and immediately start a new&#xD;
      concentric maximal intended mobilization of force contraction. During the sets and sessions,&#xD;
      the load (Watt) is monitored using the manufacturer´s application (Bluebrain, Kuopio,&#xD;
      Finland) on a portable tablet (Samsung Galaxy S4, Samsung Electronics, Daegu, South Korea)&#xD;
      connected to the FW device through Bluetooth. If the players produces on average &gt;4&#xD;
      watts·kg-1 from each repetition of one set, the FW size is increased, to #2 (0.05 kg·m-2) and&#xD;
      later to #3 (#1 + #2= 0.075 kg·m-2) and finally #4 (0.1 kg·m-2). Throughout the sessions, the&#xD;
      players are given verbal encouragement. In week 1 and 2 of the intervention, the players will&#xD;
      perform six sets with six repetitions, thereafter, in week 3, 4 and 5-6, the players will&#xD;
      perform 3x5, 4x5 repetitions and 4x4 repetitions, respectively. Recovery time between sets is&#xD;
      set to ≥3 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Barbell free weight sqaut group The BFW group performes a specialized warmup with three sets&#xD;
      of progressively increasing intensity in the squat exercise; eight repetitions at 30%-, six&#xD;
      repetitions at 50%- and six repetitions at 70% of 1RM, respectively. In all sessions, the&#xD;
      players are instructed to perform the concentric phased lift with maximal intended&#xD;
      mobilization of force and are given verbal encouragement throughout the sessions. The first&#xD;
      two sessions (week 1) consists of familiarization to the squat exercise movement with three&#xD;
      sets of eight repetitions at ~70% of 1RM. Thereafter, from the third session (week 2), the&#xD;
      players are instructed to perform four sets of four repetitions with high loads (preferably&#xD;
      &gt;85% of 1RM) throughout the remaining sessions with progressively increasing the load with&#xD;
      5kg if they can perform five repetitions within one set.&#xD;
