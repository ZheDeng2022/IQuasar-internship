      AIM OF THE WORK The aim of this work was to compare the effect of hypotensive anaesthesia&#xD;
      using Nitroglycerine versus phentolamine on Event related potentials, quantitative&#xD;
      Electroencephalograghy and cognitive function, in patients undergoing septoplasty.&#xD;

      METHODS:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design and population: This is a pilot prospective randomized clinical trial that will&#xD;
      be carried out on 60 patients candidate for septoplasty subjected to general hypotensive&#xD;
      anaesthesia. The patients will be recruited from Ear, nose and throat surgery department,&#xD;
      Beni-Suef University Hospital. All the participants will be required to offer a written&#xD;
      informed consent&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sampling Technique:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be randomly assigned into one of two equal groups; the first group will receive&#xD;
      nitroglycerine (30 participants) (nitroglycerine group) and the second group will receive&#xD;
      phentolamine (30 participants) (phentolamine group). Randomization will be carried out using&#xD;
      a closed opaque envelope technique with the anesthetist will pick up a sealed envelope which&#xD;
      contains a paper with the name of the group to which the patient will be randomized is&#xD;
      written. Whichever the group written on the paper, the patient will be scheduled to it.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All included patients will be subjected to the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
      1) Cognitive assessment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cognitive functions for the patients will be assessed (preoperative and 1 week postoperative)&#xD;
      using the following psychometric tests:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Paired Associate Learning test (PALT) Aim: to assess auditory verbal memory. The test&#xD;
           uses the concept of semantic cueing&#xD;
&#xD;
           .&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Benton Visual Retention test (BVRT) Aim: to assess visual perceptual, visual memory,&#xD;
           visual motor and visuoconstructive abilities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2) Neurophysiological assessment: Digital Electroencephalograghy (EEG), quantitative&#xD;
      Electroencephalograghy (QEEG) and Event related potentials (ERPs) and will be done for all&#xD;
      included patients (preoperative and 1 week postoperative).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis The sample size will be calculated using G*Power version 3.1.9.2&#xD;
      Software based on this pilot study. The probability of type I error (α) will be 5%, and the&#xD;
      statistical power (1-β) should exceed 80%. The data will be coded and entered using: the&#xD;
      statistical package for social science version 15 (SPSS v 15). Descriptive statistics will be&#xD;
      reported as mean ± SD and number (%) for categorical variables. Student t- test will be used&#xD;
      for comparison between means of two unpaired groups of quantitative variables. Paired sample&#xD;
      t- test will be used for comparison between means of two paired groups of quantitative&#xD;
      variables. Chi square test will be used for comparison between two groups of categorical&#xD;
      data. Mixed ANOVA test will be used for comparing paired data in two unpaired groups. The&#xD;
      probability/significance value (P value) ≥ 0.05 is not statistically significant and &lt;0.05 is&#xD;
      statistically significant.&#xD;
