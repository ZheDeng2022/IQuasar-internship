  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To explore whether intravenous ketamine followed by buprenorphine produces more rapid and&#xD;
      sustained anti-suicidal effects than ketamine followed by placebo, investigators will conduct&#xD;
      a single study that will take approximately 2.5 years to complete. 60 subjects (60 infusions)&#xD;
      or approximately 24 infusions per year.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators hypothesize that patients who receive buprenorphine following ketamine will&#xD;
      demonstrate significantly greater anti-suicidal effects beginning at day 7 and maintained for&#xD;
      the entire four weeks of the study as well as longer times to recurrence than will those who&#xD;
      receive ketamine followed by placebo. As secondary analyses, the investigators will test&#xD;
      whether there is a relationship of improvement in sleep and pain to change in suicide&#xD;
      ratings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2: To assess the potential role played by the opioid properties of a single infusion of&#xD;
      ketamine, investigators will for the ketamine portion determine ketamine and metabolite blood&#xD;
      levels during and after the infusion as well as pupillary changes and correlate them to&#xD;
      anti-suicidal response at Day 1. Investigators will also collect blood to determine&#xD;
      buprenorphine blood levels, prolactin as well as collecting data on pupillary changes and&#xD;
      then assess for potential relationships with anti-suicidal response.&#xD;

    <description>The model will include the difference in total scores on the suicidality measure from days 3 to 31 as a within subject effect, treatment, and time, as well as time x treatment interaction. The model will include Day 3 score as well. The total scores range from 0 to 38, with higher values indicating a greater risk of suicide.All effects will use p&lt;.05 for simple effects and p=0.1 for interactions, Using a sample size of 60, the hypothesis test will be fully powered (i.e., 80%) to detect effect sizes of 0.35 or greater.</description>

    <measure>The investigators will assess opioid activity of ketamine as well as buprenorphine</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 3-31</time_frame>
    <description>peripherally by exploring opioid activity in subjects treated in the ketamine infusion and the sublingual buprenorphine vs. placebo phases by measuring serum metabolites of both ketamine and buprenorphine. The metabolites are measured in ng/mL with a reference interval of 1-10. Any presence of the drug will result in a number within the interval. If none detected, a not established level will be the result.</description>

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Pupillometry</measure>
    <time_frame>change from Day 3-31</time_frame>
    <description>Moreover, we will apply pupillometry to estimate opioid activity. Levels of drug and opioid activity at specific time points will be correlated with response at that time point. In addition, regression analyses will be used to assess the relative contribution of opioid activity in blood, drug blood level, and pupil measure to improvement in suicidal behavior as well as mood, pain, and insomnia. This aim is exploratory.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A subject will be eligible for inclusion only if all of the following criteria are&#xD;
             met:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Male or female, 18 to 70 years of age, inclusive, at screen.&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Able to read, understand, and provide written, dated informed consent prior to&#xD;
                  screening. Participants will be deemed likely to comply with study protocol and&#xD;
                  communicate with study personnel about adverse events and other clinically&#xD;
                  important information.&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. Diagnosed with Major Depressive Disorder (MDD), single or recurrent, and&#xD;
                  currently experiencing a Major Depressive Episode (MDE) of at least eight weeks&#xD;
                  in duration, prior to screening, according to the criteria defined in the&#xD;
                  Diagnosis and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition, Text&#xD;
                  Revision(DSM-IV-TR™). The diagnosis of MDD will be made by a site psychiatrist&#xD;
                  and supported by the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV-TR™ (SCID-I/P).&#xD;
&#xD;
               4. Has a history of TRD during the current MDE, as assessed by the investigator. TRD&#xD;
                  is defined as failure to achieve a satisfactory response (e.g., less than 50%&#xD;
                  improvement of depression symptoms), as perceived by the participant, to at least&#xD;
                  two &quot;treatment courses&quot; of a therapeutic dose of an antidepressant therapy of at&#xD;
                  least 8 weeks duration. The adequacy of dose and duration of the antidepressant&#xD;
                  therapy will be determined as per the MGH ATRQ criteria. Participants must&#xD;
                  currently be on a stable (for at least 4 weeks) and adequate (according to the&#xD;
                  MGH ATRQ) dose of ongoing SSRI or SNRI antidepressant therapy, of which total&#xD;
                  duration must be at least 8 weeks. Participants may also have a history of&#xD;
                  intolerance to at least 2 antidepressant medications. These patients with the&#xD;
                  intolerance history will not be required to be currently taking an antidepressant&#xD;
                  medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
               5. Meet the threshold on the total SSI score of &gt;/=11 at both screening and baseline&#xD;
                  visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
               6. Participants must qualify as &quot;Moderately Treatment Refractory&quot; using the Maudsley&#xD;
                  staging method, which incorporates past treatments, severity of symptoms and&#xD;
                  duration of presenting episode.&#xD;

                  implants, injectable or patch hormonal contraception, oral contraceptives, IUD,&#xD;
                  double-barrier contraception, sexual abstinence. The form of birth control will&#xD;
