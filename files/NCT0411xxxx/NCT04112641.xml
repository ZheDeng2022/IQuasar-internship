  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group phase II&#xD;
      trial is to determine whether nicotinamide riboside (NIAGEN®, NR) can ameliorate persistent&#xD;
      peripheral neuropathy in cancer survivors who have completed chemotherapy with taxane or&#xD;
      platinum-complex compounds between 1 and 12 months earlier.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      142 patients who have been declared to be in complete remission after treatment of their&#xD;
      cancer with either taxane or platinum-based compounds and who have persistent neuropathy will&#xD;
      be randomized to receive either placebo or NIAGEN capsules daily for 84 days. On enrollment,&#xD;
      subjects will complete several questionnaires characterizing the type and severity of their&#xD;
      neuropathy. Their fifth finger will be scanned to determine the density of sensory afferents&#xD;
      in the skin, and a skin biopsy will be taken above the ankle for histological analysis of&#xD;
      nerve fiber density. Blood samples will be drawn for baseline measures of NAD+ levels, and&#xD;
      clinical chemistries and indices of liver and kidney function. Subjects will be asked to&#xD;
      return every two weeks to complete the questionnaires, and blood will be drawn to measure&#xD;
      biomarkers of NIAGEN consumption. Blood will be drawn at visits on days 28, 56, and 84 for&#xD;
      clinical chemistries and measures of liver and kidney function. At visits on day 42 and 84,&#xD;
      additional measures of density of nerve fibers in the hand and leg will be made. The last&#xD;
      treatment day will be day 84, at which time all measures will be redetermined. A follow-up&#xD;
      period of 3 months is planned at which time all measures will be conducted once again to&#xD;
      determine if any alleviation of the chemotherapy has persisted after treatment ended.&#xD;
      Patients enrolled in this study will receive standard of care treatment by their oncologists,&#xD;
      which includes computed tomography, magnetic resonance or ultrasound scans every three months&#xD;
      as surveillance for cancer re-occurrence.&#xD;

    <measure>Score on Sensory Subscale of Quality of Life Questionnaire Chemotherapy-induced Peripheral Neuropathy (QLQ-CIPN20)</measure>
    <time_frame>84 days</time_frame>
    <description>Change in score from baseline to end of treatment at 84 days. The Quality of Life Questionnaire for Chemotherapy-induced Peripheral Neuropathy (20 questions) or QLQ-CIPN20 yields scores of 1-4 (Likert scale) for 9 sensory, 8 motor, and 3 autonomic sequelae of chemotherapy. The minimum score for the sensory subscale is 9 and the maximum possible score is 36. The higher the score, the worse the signs and symptoms. The raw score can, at the investigator's discretion, be linearly transformed to a 0-100 scale, where higher numbers represent worse symptoms.&#xD;
Recent publications call the validity of the autonomic scale into question, and it is not being used in this study.</description>

    <description>Change in score from baseline to end of treatment at 84 days. The clinical version of the Total Neuropathy Score yields scores of 0-4 on 6 items (sensory symptoms, motor symptoms, pin sensibility, vibration sensibility, strength and deep tendon reflex). The minimum possible score is 0 and the maximum possible score is 30. Scores for each of the six items are summed to yield a single total score. The higher the score, the worse the outcome.</description>
