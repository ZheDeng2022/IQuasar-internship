      Objective: The purpose of this randomized controlled split-mouth clinical trial was to&#xD;
      evaluate the effectiveness of MI paste in reducing sensitivity associated vital bleaching.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: 45 subjects were randomly divided into two groups, based upon which arch received MI&#xD;
      Paste. Group 1 bleached Maxillary arch, Group 2 bleached mandibular arch. Two weeks later&#xD;
      subjects stopped bleaching the first arch and started second arch. Sensitivity was measured&#xD;
      by VAS daily log scale for two weeks. Shade was taken with colorimeter and Classic Vita shade&#xD;
      guide at baseline, immediate post-bleaching, and two weeks post-bleaching. Longitudinal&#xD;
      sensitivity over the 14 days period of bleaching was summarized. The Wilcoxon Signed Rank&#xD;
      test was used to compare summary measures.&#xD;

      Study Design&#xD;
&#xD;
      This was a randomized, controlled, split-mouth cross-over design clinical trial. Subjects&#xD;
      were randomized into two groups depending on the control and intervention arches:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group 1: The maxillary arch was the control arch (only bleaching) while the mandibular&#xD;
           arch (MN) was intervention arch (bleaching and MI Paste).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group 2: The MN arch was the control arch (only bleaching) while the MX arch was the&#xD;
           intervention arch (bleaching and MI Paste).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethical permission for the study was obtained from the University Intuitional Review Board&#xD;
      (No. 200604706). The study was conducted in full accordance with the Helsinki Declaration and&#xD;
      reported using CONSORT guidelines. Informed consents were obtained from the subjects prior to&#xD;
      enrolment in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants Forty-six participants were recruited at the Oral Health Center. Participants&#xD;
      were included if they age between 18 and 55 years old with no prior history of bleaching, not&#xD;
      using any desensitizing agents, and with anterior teeth of shade A2 or higher. Participants&#xD;
      allergic to milk protein, pregnant, and/or on daily NSAIDs were excluded. They were also&#xD;
      excluded if they have had an anterior crown or composite restoration, scaling or periodontal&#xD;
      surgery performed in the past six months, and/or had a history of bleaching.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention Both the bleaching gel (TiON whitening gel (GC America Inc) and MI paste&#xD;
      (PROSPECTM MI paste) were delivered using custom trays with reservoir made for participants&#xD;
      at the beginning of the study. To avoid contamination, the control arch was always bleached&#xD;
      first. Group 1 subjects were instructed to use 15% carbamide peroxide on maxillary arch while&#xD;
      group 2 were instructed to use it on the mandibular arch. Subjects stopped bleaching on their&#xD;
      respective arches after 2 weeks. Subjects were then given bleach and MI paste to be used on&#xD;
      the opposing arch (Group 1 used it on the mandibular arch and Group 2 used it on maxillary&#xD;
      arch).&#xD;
&#xD;
      For bleaching only arch, participants were instructed to wear the trays each night for 6-8&#xD;
      hours for two weeks. Subjects were given a VAS daily log to document the sensitivity for two&#xD;
      weeks. For bleach and MI Paste arch, participants were instructed to brush and floss their&#xD;
      teeth, load the non-scalloped tray with MI Paste, wear it for 5 minutes, remove the tray,&#xD;
      spit out the excess, and not to eat or drink for one hour. They were instructed to bleach&#xD;
      after that for 6-8 hours for the next two weeks. Participants were instructed not to bleach&#xD;
      the first arch anymore. Participants were given a VAS daily log to document the sensitivity&#xD;
      score for each day for two weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measurements Measurements were made at baseline (Time 0), 2 weeks after initiation of&#xD;
      bleaching (Time 1) and 2 weeks after the end of treatment (i.e., 4 weeks after initiation of&#xD;
      bleaching; Time 2) for each arch. Longitudinal VAS scores were to be assessed at baseline&#xD;
      (Day 0) and daily during the two weeks of bleaching (Days 1 through 14).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sensitivity Sensitivity was measured using thermal sensitivity scale (VAS) of 0-10, with 0&#xD;
      being &quot;no pain&quot; and 10 being &quot;severe pain.&quot; Subjects were asked to pick a number. Thermal&#xD;
      sensitivity was measured by using a 1-second air blast at 70oF from dental unit air syringe&#xD;
      as per American Dental Association (ADA) guidelines. A Scale of 0-3 was used to measure the&#xD;
      pain response with 0 indicating &quot;no pain&quot; and 3 indicating the &quot;severe pain&quot; which lasted for&#xD;
      more than 10 seconds12.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Shade Value-oriented Vita classical shade guide was used to determine the shade of the teeth&#xD;
      under standardized conditions for color corrected light. Shade scores were ordered from 1 to&#xD;
      16 according to the brightness grouping recommended by the manufactures. A hand held&#xD;
      coloriometer &quot;Shade Vision&quot; (X-rite, Inc) was used to measure shade digitally. Shade Vision&#xD;
      identifies color difference using three dimensional CIE L*a*b* values system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants' Survey Participants were given a survey at the end of the study examining their&#xD;
      perception on the ease of application of MI Paste as well as the impact of MI Paste on&#xD;
      sensitivity and gingival inflammation.&#xD;
