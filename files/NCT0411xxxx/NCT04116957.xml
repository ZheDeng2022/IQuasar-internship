      The purpose of the project is to develop a new way to understand patient care data analytics&#xD;
      by using a real-time location system (RTLS). The investigators will deploy the RTLS-based&#xD;
      nursing activity analysis system at an ICU at the University Hospital, University of Missouri&#xD;
      Health Care in Columbia, Missouri. The investigators will validate location system&#xD;
      performance against manual observation of nursing activity. The investigators will correlate&#xD;
      nursing activity metrics against patient outcomes as measured by SOFA score.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Real-Time Location Systems (RTLS) identify and locate tagged assets, staff, or patients as&#xD;
      they move through a hospital. RTLS can address a variety of other practical problems in&#xD;
      healthcare such as inventory management and patient tracking and monitoring. Most RTLS employ&#xD;
      some flavor of Radio Frequency (RF) angle-of-arrival, time-of-flight,&#xD;
      time-difference-of-arrival, or Received Signal Strength Indicators (RSSI). However, these&#xD;
      techniques have several significant disadvantages. Among these are confusion from multipath&#xD;
      and environmental clutter, line-of-sight operation, need for synchronization, range&#xD;
      restrictions, and expense. Furthermore the human body, composed mainly of salt water, occults&#xD;
      high frequency signals making fading a serious problem. Wi-Fi tracking, in particular is,&#xD;
      limited to an accuracy of 10-20ft and cannot provide the precision data required for&#xD;
      high-fidelity applications in healthcare such as workflow management.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the current study, the investigators will validate location system performance against&#xD;
      manual observation of nursing activity. The investigators will correlate nursing activity&#xD;
      metrics against patient outcomes as measured by SOFA score. The anticipated outcome is&#xD;
      actionable, location-based data to describe, analyze, or validate healthcare processes with a&#xD;
      maximum error of 5% relative to manual observation. Also, the investigators will identify&#xD;
      specific location-based metrics useful in monitoring nursing activity. The investigators will&#xD;
      deploy and test the system in a medical ICU at the University Hospital ICU. The anticipated&#xD;
      outcome is a real-time statistical quality control chart capable of monitoring nursing&#xD;
      processes and detecting anomalies with user-configurable statistical power.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prospective participants will receive an individual email from co-investigator explaining&#xD;
      study including the need for participants willing to wear location tag for the duration of&#xD;
      their shift. The Informed Consent form and Demographic Question will be attached to this&#xD;
      email. Those willing to participate will also be asked to send the completed Demographics&#xD;
      Questionnaire attached to their email response. Receipt of the completed Demographics&#xD;
      Questionnaire will signify their consent to participate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The co-investigator will explain in the individual email that this study is to solely gain&#xD;
      knowledge regarding their workflow as they deliver patient care and is not an evaluation of&#xD;
      their performance or clinical judgment. Their participation in the study will not be revealed&#xD;
      to their manager unless the participant wishes. The co-investigator will explain that&#xD;
      participation is voluntary, they can withdraw at any time without risk to their employment&#xD;
      and all aspects of their participation will be confidential.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A Waiver of documentation of consent form will be attached to the individual's email as well&#xD;
      as the Demographic Questionnaire. The Waiver of Documentation of Consent form will provide an&#xD;
      overview of the study. They will be informed both in the form and in the text of the email&#xD;
      that the return of the completed Demographic Questionnaire signifies their consent to&#xD;
      participate in the study and that participation is voluntary and confidential. They will be&#xD;
      provided with the co-investigator's contact information should they have questions or&#xD;
      concerns. In addition, information from the EMRs of patients assigned to the nurse&#xD;
      participants will be abstracted retrospectively under the Waiver of Consent after the&#xD;
      patients have been transferred from the ICU. Patient factors will be used to help interpret&#xD;
      the nurse participant data. However, concurrent patient data abstraction is not necessary for&#xD;
      data analysis in this research project as there will be no intervention introduced that would&#xD;
      impact the patient data. Further, patients in this ICU are usually unable to provide informed&#xD;
      consent due to the presence of mechanical ventilation and continuous sedation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruited nurses will receive one RTLS location tag prior to their shift from trained&#xD;
      undergraduate industrial and manufacturing systems engineering (IMSE) students who will keep&#xD;
      a log of the nurses' name and tag identification. The nurses will carry the tags for the&#xD;
      duration of their shift and then return the tags to the students. While they carry the RTLS&#xD;
      tags, IMSE students will stand at the corner of the nurse's station in each pod to record the&#xD;
      nurses' activities and the time spent in these activities using a data collection form&#xD;
      previously developed during earlier pilot work when IMSE students collected time-motion data&#xD;
      regarding ICU nursing care activities. If any special events occur during the observation&#xD;
      period, they will record a description of these events, which include but not be limited to&#xD;
      unscheduled medical activities or admission of a new patient to the ICU from the Emergency&#xD;
      Department (ED). The RTLS location tag distribution and nurse observation will occur four to&#xD;
      five days per week until a total of 80 days of location and observation data is obtained. For&#xD;
      each patient that is assigned to an observed ICU nurse, data will be extracted&#xD;
      retrospectively from their EMR. The abstracted data will include: age, gender, hospital&#xD;
      admitting diagnosis, medical ICU admitting diagnosis, past medical diagnoses, laboratory&#xD;
      values occurring during, or 24 hours prior to observation time, neurological status, mean&#xD;
      arterial pressures during observation time, intravenous medications administered during&#xD;
      observation time, any diagnostic studies performed outside of the ICU during the observation&#xD;
      time, and any in-room procedures performed during the observation time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is minimal risk to the participants in this study. There are no potential risks or&#xD;
      discomfort for the participant as there will be no change in their work process. Methods to&#xD;
      avoid inadvertent coercion in the recruitment process will be deployed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analyzing the ICU nurse's workflow can furnish an understanding of the causes of delayed and&#xD;
      missed care delivery. The findings from this research will highlight opportunities to improve&#xD;
      the workflow management design. Such information can guide future workflow management to&#xD;
      reduce the ICU nurse's workload and the risk of delayed or missed care in the ICU resulting&#xD;
      in improved patient outcomes.&#xD;
