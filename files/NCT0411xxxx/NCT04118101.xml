  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Erector spinae plane block (ESPB) is a relatively new plane block that was first described by&#xD;
      Forero et al. in 2016, to manage persistent neuropathic pain following malunited rib fracture&#xD;
      and persistent post-thoracotomy neuropathic pain.It's a relatively simple, ultrasound guided&#xD;
      block in which the local anesthetic drugs are injected in the plane between the erector&#xD;
      spinae muscle and the vertebral transverse process.This allows the injected local anesthetics&#xD;
      to block the ventral and dorsal rami of the spinal nerves in the paravertebral area.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The literature reveals successful case reports denoting the use of ESPB for pain control in&#xD;
      cases of acute kidney transplant,percutaneous nephrolithomy, abdominal surgeries including&#xD;
      laparoscopic and open nephrectomy, and nephrectomy in the pediatric population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this prospective randomized controlled study is to investigate the efficacy of&#xD;
      ESPB for pain control in adult patients undergoing open renal surgery through a flank&#xD;
      incision with respect to pain scores, postoperative analgesia consumption and patient&#xD;
      satisfaction.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective randomized controlled study which will be conducted in the&#xD;
      Anesthesiology Department at Theodor Bilharz Research Institute after approval by the&#xD;
      institutional review board and obtaining patient informed consent. 46 patients will be&#xD;
      enrolled in the study and will be randomized to be equally divided into two groups: ESPB&#xD;
      group(E group) and control group (C group).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anesthetic technique:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A preoperative assessment, including a history, physical examination, review of laboratory&#xD;
      data, and assignment of ASA classification will be performed on all patients prior to the&#xD;
      procedure. After premedication with intravenous midazolam 2 mg, patients will be transferred&#xD;
      to the operating room.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Standard monitors such as noninvasive blood pressure, electrocardiography (ECG), and pulse&#xD;
      oximetry (SpO2) will be attached. Anesthesia will be induced using propofol 1-2 mg/kg,&#xD;
      fentanyl 1-2 µg/kg and sevoflurane. After adequate manual ventilation, atracurium 0.5 mg/kg&#xD;
      will be administered to facilitate endotracheal intubation. Ventilation will be started with&#xD;
      oxygen and medical air (FiO2 = 0.6). Patients will be positioned in the lateral position to&#xD;
      perform the ESPB and for preparation for surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Erector SpinaePlane Block technique:&#xD;
&#xD;
      After skin sterilization and draping, a high-frequency linear array ultrasound probe will be&#xD;
      placed on the back in a transverse orientation to identify the tip of the T7 transverse&#xD;
      process. The tip of the transverse process will be centered on the ultrasound screen and the&#xD;
      probe will then be rotated into a longitudinal orientation to produce a parasagittal view, in&#xD;
      which the following layers will be visible superficial to the acoustic shadows of the&#xD;
      transverse processes: skin and subcutaneous tissue, trapezius and erector spinae muscle.The&#xD;
      rhomboid major muscle has its lower border a tthe T5-6 vertebral level and its absence will&#xD;
      be used as additional confirmation that the T7 transverse process is being viewed. An&#xD;
      echogenic 22-G block needle will be inserted in-plane to the ultrasound beam in a&#xD;
      cranial-to-caudal direction until contact is made with the T7 transverse process. Correct&#xD;
      location of the needle tip in the fascial plane deep to erector spinae muscle will confirmed&#xD;
      by injecting 0.5-1 ml normal saline and seeing the fluid lifting the erector spinae muscle&#xD;
      off the transverse process without distending the muscle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ESPB group:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 25 ml bupivacaine 0.5% will be injected into the ESP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Control group:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The ESPB will not be performed. Surgical technique and postoperative care will follow&#xD;
      standard local clinical practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pain management:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Numerical Rating Scale (NRS) pain score will be used immediately postoperatively and then at&#xD;
      30 minutes, 1, 2, 4, 6, 12 and 24 h. Scores (1-3) are considered mild pain, (4-6) moderate&#xD;
      pain and (7-10) severe pain. Rescue analgesia with intravenous pethidine (25 mg) will be&#xD;
      prescribed if the patient's resting NRS score is more than three or on patient demand.&#xD;
      Additional intravenous doses of 25 mg of pethidine will be given if needed to achieve a score&#xD;
      below 4. The second rescue analgesic plan will be intravenous ketorolac 30 mg diluted in 100&#xD;
      ml normal saline and administered slowly, if NRS remained persistently &gt;3 after 15 min of the&#xD;
      first rescue analgesic administration.&#xD;

&#xD;
        2. Sex&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. BMI&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
        7. Numerical Rating Scale (NRS) pain score immediately postoperatively and then at 30&#xD;
           minutes, 1, 2, 4, 6, 12 and 24 h.&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. Postoperative analgesia consumption&#xD;
&#xD;
        9. The overall degree of patient satisfaction will be assessed using a three-point scale&#xD;
           (good, moderate, and bad) on the first postoperative day.&#xD;
&#xD;
       10. Block related complications (e.g Pneumothorax)&#xD;
&#xD;
       11. Postoperative opioid related complications (e.g. Nausea, vomiting, constipation,&#xD;
           sedation)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistics:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients will be randomly divided into two groups; group (E) and group (C). Forty-six&#xD;
      patients will be prospectively enrolled for each study of patients who had been diagnosed to&#xD;
      be able to reject the null hypothesis that the population means of the groups are equal with&#xD;
      Power calculations suggested that a minimum of 23 subjects per group will be required to&#xD;
      detect 10% difference in time for first rescue analgesia between groups (taking type I or α&#xD;
      error of 5%, type II or β error of 20% and Standard Deviation=10). To be on a safer side,&#xD;
      patients will be included in each group (n=23).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analyses will be performed using JMP ver. 12.0 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC,&#xD;
      USA). The number of patients who will be reported complications corresponding percentage (%)&#xD;
      for nominal variables; for continuous variables with normal distribution, and the&#xD;
      Mann-Whitney U test will be used for nonparametric variables. The level of significance for&#xD;
      both the tests set at p&lt;0.05.&#xD;
