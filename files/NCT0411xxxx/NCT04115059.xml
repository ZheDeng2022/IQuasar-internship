  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is Phase I pilot, single center study designed to explore the safety of Dasatinib in&#xD;
      symptomatic Waldenström Macroglobulinemia participants who are progressing on ibrutinib&#xD;
      therapy with BTK Cys481 or PLCG2 mutations&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This research study is a Pilot Study, which is the first time investigators are examining&#xD;
      this drug in patients with Waldenström Macroglobulinemia who have progressed on ibrutinib.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who fulfill eligibility criteria will be entered into the trial to receive Dasatinib&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the screening procedures confirm participation in the research study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participant will be given a study drug-dosing calendar for each treatment cycle. In this&#xD;
      research study, the investigators are planning to give Dasatinib, which is a targeted therapy&#xD;
      intended to treat cancer by binding to the target protein called BTK.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  BTK is believed to be an important target for treatment of patients with specific gene&#xD;
           mutations. Some patients who have disease progression after taking ibrutinib have these&#xD;
           gene mutations.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Making treatment decisions based on genetic testing is investigational, and the FDA has&#xD;
           not approved this genetic testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has not approved Dasatinib for Waldenström&#xD;
      Macroglobulinemia but it has been approved for other uses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dasatinib is produced by Bristol-Myers Squibb.&#xD;
