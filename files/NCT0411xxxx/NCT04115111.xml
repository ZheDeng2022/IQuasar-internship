  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM) is a cancer with high mortality rate and few therapeutic&#xD;
      options. Its incidence is growing fast worldwide and is associated with asbestos exposure, a&#xD;
      well known cancerogenic factor driving the development of this cancer. Generally MPM is&#xD;
      diagnosed at an advanced inoperable stage and most frequently the only therapeutic approach&#xD;
      is palliative chemotherapy. Platinum-pemetrexed doublets prolong significantly median overall&#xD;
      survival (OS) and median progression free survival (PFS) with respect to platinum alone and&#xD;
      are considered the only therapeutic option in a first line setting. Unfortunately,&#xD;
      essentially all patients usually progress and die subsequently to a first line therapyl.&#xD;
      There is strong evidence that the immune system is deeply involved in the biogenesis of MPM&#xD;
      and that an imbalance in pro-inflammatory cytokines and exhausted adaptive T-cell mediated&#xD;
      immune response are the main causes of neoangiogenesis, progression and metastatisation&#xD;
      processes. Newer immunotherapeutic agents act on regulatory molecules expressed on immune&#xD;
      cells in order to increase T cell activity and immune response against tumor. The&#xD;
      anti-cytotoxic T lymphocyte antigen 4 (anti-CTLA4) demonstrated activity and a long-term&#xD;
      disease control (DC) rate in advanced pretreated MPM in phase II study even if these results&#xD;
      are not confirmed in more recently Phase IIb randomized trial versus placebo (DETERMINE&#xD;
      study). Antibodies against Programmed Death 1 receptor (PD-1) and its ligand (PD-L1) are&#xD;
      highly promising new agents regulating immune check-point processes. In particular the&#xD;
      interaction of these agents takes place peripherally more than in the lymphoid tissue and may&#xD;
      explain the higher response rate and lower adverse immune effects in comparison to antiCTLA4&#xD;
      agents. AntiPD-L1 antibodies are widely studied in many Phase I-II trials in different&#xD;
      advanced pretreated solid tumors independent of tumor PD-L1 expression, with promising&#xD;
      results and long-term survival. Ongoing melanoma and lung cancer phase III trials would&#xD;
      probably better define the role of this class of drugs in clinical practice. Durvalumab is a&#xD;
      human IgG1 antibody which binds specifically to PD-L1, preventing binding to PD-1 and CD80.&#xD;
      Numerous Phase II-III clinical trials are underway evaluating Durvalumab either as&#xD;
      monotherapy or combination with evidence of activity in a wide range of solid tumors.&#xD;
      Durvalumab has received FDA approval as second line treatment in patients with locally&#xD;
      advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Given these prospects for PD-L1 Ab, a Phase II study is proposed in order to evaluate the&#xD;
      activity and safety of Durvalumab in advanced pretreated MPM.&#xD;
