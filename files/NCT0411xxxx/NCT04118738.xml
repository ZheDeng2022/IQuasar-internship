      The International Cohort Study of Children Born to Women Infected with Zika Virus (ZIKV)&#xD;
      During Pregnancy study is a prospective, observational, international cohort study of&#xD;
      children previously enrolled in the ZIP study or other ZIP 2.0 Protocol Team approved&#xD;
      ZIKV-cohort study that will continue the longitudinal follow-up of children born with&#xD;
      documented confirmed or presumptive in-utero ZIKV exposure (&quot;ZIKV-exposed&quot; cohort) and&#xD;
      children born without documented confirmed or presumptive in-utero ZIKV exposure, matched by&#xD;
      site and birth sex (&quot;ZIKV-unexposed&quot; cohort).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up evaluations and assessments will allow for the determination and comparison of&#xD;
      long-term neurodevelopmental outcomes among in utero ZIKV-exposed and ZIKV-unexposed&#xD;
      children. Each participant will be followed for about 2 years, beginning at approximately 18&#xD;
      months through 42 months of age.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The International Prospective Observational Cohort Study of Zika in Infants and Pregnancy&#xD;
      (ZIP) study has leveraged 10 international sites to follow mother-infant dyads prospectively&#xD;
      in pregnancy and postpartum to determine the incidence and outcomes of Zika Virus (ZIKV)&#xD;
      infection. The ZIP study has collected demographic, physical, environmental, laboratory, and&#xD;
      delivery outcome data in relation to mother-infant pairs with and without ZIKV infection.&#xD;
      Infants born to women enrolled in the ZIP study are followed for 1 year and undergo regular&#xD;
      physical and neurological assessments to identify clinical or developmental outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The International Cohort Study of Children Born to Women Infected with Zika Virus During&#xD;
      Pregnancy (ZIP 2.0) study will enroll children who themselves or whose biological mothers&#xD;
      were previously enrolled in the ZIP study and other ZIP 2.0 Protocol Team-approved studies.&#xD;
      Assessments include growth, neurodevelopmental, audiologic, ophthalmologic, and other&#xD;
      clinical outcomes. Evaluations will occur about every 6 months over about a 2-year period&#xD;
      beginning at approximately 18 months of age. Follow-up evaluations and assessments will allow&#xD;
      for the determination and comparison of long-term neurodevelopmental outcomes among in utero&#xD;
      ZIKV-exposed and ZIKV-unexposed children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After parent(s)/legal guardian(s) permission is obtained for the child's participation in ZIP&#xD;
      2.0, several means to contact them will be requested. Parents will be asked whether or not&#xD;
      messages can be left for each of the phone numbers provided and if messages can contain&#xD;
      information regarding the nature of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We expect to compare approximately 200 children with documented confirmed or presumptive&#xD;
      in-utero ZIKV exposure and 200 controls matched by site and birth sex without documented&#xD;
      confirmed or presumptive in-utero ZIKV exposure at age approximately 18 months, and at age 42&#xD;
      months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective is to determine the long-term neurodevelopmental outcomes among&#xD;
      children born with documented confirmed or presumptive in-utero ZIKV exposure. The secondary&#xD;
      objectives are to compare the long-term effects (e.g., on growth, vision, hearing and&#xD;
      neurodevelopment) of in-utero ZIKV-exposure compared to unexposed children.&#xD;
