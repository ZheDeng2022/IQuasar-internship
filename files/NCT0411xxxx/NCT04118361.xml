  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Vertigo integrated with acute vestibular syndrome (AVS) is a frequent reason for emergency&#xD;
      visits. The French and international literature estimates between 2 to 4% of vertigo&#xD;
      prevalence among reasons for coming to emergencies. International classifications define AVS&#xD;
      as vertigo or acute dizziness (less than one month) and persistent, gait instability, nausea&#xD;
      or vomiting, nystagmus or an intolerance to head movements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In emergency departments, the clinical approach of vertiginous patients is difficult because&#xD;
      the &quot;vertigo&quot; term is sometimes used in by patients, or because they use the terms&#xD;
      &quot;uneasiness&quot;, &quot;vertigo&quot;, or &quot;dizziness&quot; without distinction. These terms sometimes include&#xD;
      various sensations of &quot;sleeping head&quot;, &quot;blurred vision&quot;, &quot;instability&quot;, &quot;pitch&quot; etc. A first&#xD;
      difficulty is therefore to clarify these terms and organize syndrome expressed by the&#xD;
      patient. A rigorous interrogation is therefore essential and can be time-consuming.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Another difficulty is to carry out an exhaustive clinical examination including the&#xD;
      assessment of the general condition and hydration, an ENT examination and a neurological&#xD;
      examination. However, at the end of these steps, the orientation central or peripheral&#xD;
      etiology is not simple. In the last consensus conference of the Barany Society (2014) the&#xD;
      classification of VAS into three types was not sufficient to distinguish &quot;benign&quot; vertigo&#xD;
      from &quot;risky&quot; dizziness (related to a central cause).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The HINTS test (Head Impulse, Nystagmus, Test of Skew) is a clinical test composed of 3&#xD;
      oculomotor examinations: the search for high frequency vestibulo-ocular reflex during a&#xD;
      passive impulse of the head (Head Impulse test), the detection of a spontaneous nystagmus and&#xD;
      a vertical divergence. It has been developed to evaluate patients with AVS defined as vertigo&#xD;
      or acute and persistent dizziness sometimes accompanied by nausea or vomiting, and/or gait&#xD;
      instability, and/or nystagmus, and/or intolerance to head movements. This time saving is&#xD;
      important, as a complete neurological examination usually takes between 10 and 15 minutes.&#xD;
      The presence of at least one of the three items of central locator value is sufficient to&#xD;
      diagnose a central cause of AVS, including normal early brain imaging. Some studies suggest&#xD;
      that absence of these three criteria does not require an emergency neuroimaging examination&#xD;
      and allows ambulatory management of the patient, in search of a peripheral cause of the ENT&#xD;
      sphere.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The STANDING clinical algorithm (SponTAneous, Nystagmus, Direction, head Impulse test,&#xD;
      STANDING) was proposed by Vanni in 2015 for diagnosis of the AVS central causes in&#xD;
      emergencies in a one-year prospective Italian monocentric study. The STANDING algorithm&#xD;
      consists of clinical elements that can be evaluated in about 10 minutes at the patient's&#xD;
      bedside: two oculomotor examinations (Head Impulse Test and detection of a nystagmus),&#xD;
      detection of ataxia and practice of release maneuvers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently, the patient management with isolated AVS in the emergency room lacks an ideal&#xD;
      diagnostic clinical test: efficient, non-invasive, inexpensive and painless.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators would like to know what diagnostic performance of the HINTS test&#xD;
      (sensitivity and specificity) is when it is performed by emergency physicians on a population&#xD;
      of patients with isolated AVS in emergency room. They can thus either be part of non-urgent&#xD;
      outpatient care in the event of suspicion of a peripheral cause of the ENT sphere, or part of&#xD;
      rapid and aggressive inpatient neurological care in the event of suspicion of a central&#xD;
      cerebral cause.&#xD;
