  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase IIa trial studies how well rintatolimod and pembrolizumab works in treating&#xD;
      patients with colorectal cancer that does not respond to treatment (refractory), has spread&#xD;
      to other places in the body (metastatic), or otherwise cannot be removed by surgery&#xD;
      (unresectable). Rintatolimod is an immuno-oncology agent that can stimulate the immune&#xD;
      system. Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as pembrolizumab, may help the body's&#xD;
      immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow&#xD;
      and spread. Giving rintatolimod and pembrolizumab together may work better than standard of&#xD;
      care in treating patients with colorectal cancer.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Determine the objective response rate of patients with metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC)&#xD;
      treated with rintatolimod + pembrolizumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Establish the adverse event profile of combining rintatolimod and pembrolizumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Estimate the median progression free survival and overall survival of patients with mCRC&#xD;
      treated with rintatolimod and pembrolizumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. Determine the immune objective response rate of patients with mCRC treated with&#xD;
      rintatolimod + pembrolizumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Assess modulation of the levels of CD8alpha expression and cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL)&#xD;
      density pre- and post-therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Assess chemokine levels in the tumor microenvironment and peripheral blood, including&#xD;
      effector T cell (Teff)-attracting and regulatory T cell (Treg)-favoring chemokines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. Characterize the fecal microbiotic profile and correlate those results with antitumor&#xD;
      immune responses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive rintatolimod intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on days 1-3 and&#xD;
      pembrolizumab IV over 30 minutes on day 3. Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 3 cycles&#xD;
      in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Beginning in cycle 4,&#xD;
      patients receive rintatolimod IV over 30 minutes and pembrolizumab IV over 30 minutes on day&#xD;
      1. Cycles repeat every 21 days for up to 24 months from the first dose in the absence of&#xD;
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 and 90 days, and every 6&#xD;
      months for up to 2 years.&#xD;

             drugs). Replacement therapy (e.g., thyroxine, insulin, or physiologic corticosteroid&#xD;
             replacement therapy for adrenal or pituitary insufficiency, etc.) is not considered a&#xD;
             form of systemic treatment&#xD;
