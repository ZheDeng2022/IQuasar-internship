    <textblock>
      This is a prospective study for Investigating the cost-effectiveness of current bracing&#xD;
      protocols for adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS). It is hypothesized that aggressive&#xD;
      management of adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS) including early bracing at mild curve&#xD;
      magnitudes and surgery at 40 degrees is more cost-effective while maintaining similar health&#xD;
      quality of life. Scoliosis Research Society 22-item and EuroQol- 5 dimension questionnaires&#xD;
      and direct/indirect medical costs will be utilized for the cost-effectiveness analysis and&#xD;
      health related quality of life assessment. The findings of this study have the potential to&#xD;
      improve decision-making and revolutionize care of AIS patients in Hong Kong and globally.&#xD;
      Clinicians will be able to utilize our results to provide the best and most cost-effective&#xD;
      timing for initiating brace treatment.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Bracing is the mainstay treatment for preventing adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS)&#xD;
      progression and the main purpose for treatment is to prevent deformities from reaching the&#xD;
      surgical threshold. It has been shown to be effective at reducing curve progression&#xD;
      especially in patients with good compliance to treatment. However, bracing should not be used&#xD;
      indiscriminately as certain complications have been reported. Bracing too early is safe for&#xD;
      curve control but may subject children to prolonged discomfort with the bracing and increased&#xD;
      consumption of resources for periodic brace fabrication. Prolonged bracing also reduces&#xD;
      spinal mobility, lead to poor body image and self-esteem, and worsen quality of life.&#xD;
      Additional risks of osteoporosis and muscular atrophy may also occur. Hence, being able to&#xD;
      initiate prompt and appropriate bracing is crucial for achieving optimal curve control and&#xD;
      avoiding complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Yet, there are still have difficulties identifying patients who may deteriorate. Generally&#xD;
      speaking, skeletally immature AIS patients with curves of 20-40 degrees should consider&#xD;
      bracing. However, not all of these patients require bracing and some may not need any&#xD;
      treatment. More importantly, the resulting curve magnitude on radiographs may not correlate&#xD;
      directly with health-related quality of life (HRQOL) measures. As such, the relationship of&#xD;
      the Cobb angle prior to initiating brace treatment with long-term HRQOL measures is unknown.&#xD;
      The above suggest that there is a significant gap in our knowledge of the optimal timing of&#xD;
      brace initiation for managing AIS patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the current setting of rising health-care expenditures, it is also important to assess the&#xD;
      &quot;value&quot; of management options and provide the best and cost-effective care for our AIS&#xD;
      patients without compromising outcomes or safety. Some clinicians may be more aggressive by&#xD;
      bracing children with minor curves while some are content with prescribing braces only when&#xD;
      deterioration occurs in moderate curves. In this modern era of healthcare, there is&#xD;
      increasing emphasis placed on monitoring and controlling health-care costs to the patient,&#xD;
      hospital and insurance companies. Hence, it is an appropriate time to consider the&#xD;
      relationship of cost-effectiveness factors and HRQOL measures in designing bracing protocols&#xD;
      for AIS patients. With increasing health-care costs, consumption of resources, and the&#xD;
      imperative to provide the best healthcare to these children, and focus on a cost-effective&#xD;
      delivery of care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is thus timely for us to perform this prospective cost-effectiveness comparative study to&#xD;
      identify the best indications for initiating brace treatment for AIS patients. Evidence for&#xD;
      the best HRQOL outcomes at the lowest cost from both the patient and health-care perspective&#xD;
      is necessary to further improve the care for AIS patients. There is potential for the derived&#xD;
      model to be applied in other healthcare systems by using a more personalized approach.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For this study, the investigators will utilize mathematical modeling based on factors&#xD;
      including initial Cobb angle, maturity status, brace duration, and HRQOL measures to&#xD;
      determine the best cost-effective indications for brace treatment. Outcomes will be dependent&#xD;
      on the Cobb angle at the end of bracing, HRQOL measures and the overall costs incurred to&#xD;
      patients and infrastructure. Our hypothesis is given an AIS patient with significant growth&#xD;
      potential, a Cobb angle of 25 degrees is most cost-effective for initiating bracing. On the&#xD;
      contrary, bracing for subjects with Cobb angles of 40 degrees or more is not cost-effective&#xD;
      regardless of remaining growth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objectives of this study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To assess the cost-effectiveness of current bracing protocols for AIS.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To create a mathematical model that will determine the most cost-effective threshold for&#xD;
           initiating brace treatment based on health quality of life measures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a prospective comparative cost-effectiveness analysis between bracing groups. This&#xD;
      study will be carried out at the Duchess of Kent Children's Hospital (DKCH). Prospective&#xD;
      collection of data from AIS patients including clinical and radiographic information. The&#xD;
      investigators will only include AIS patients seen in the first setting with remaining growth&#xD;
      potential (Risser 0-2) that may be considered for bracing, and will be prescribed with either&#xD;
      underarm (Boston) or Milwaukee bracing. The investigators will collect a minimum of two-year&#xD;
      longitudinal data, having at least 5 follow-up data points or clinic visits. It is clinic&#xD;
      protocol that all subjects undergo weight, height and arm span measurements, radiographs and&#xD;
      doctor assessments at these visits. For this study, HRQOL and utility measurements are vital&#xD;
      to its success. Thus, the SRS-22r and EQ-5D-5L questionnaire will be provided at every visit.&#xD;
      Three subgroups for analysis between groups. For groups of baseline Cobb angles (20-&lt;35,&#xD;
      35-40, &gt;40 degrees)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Direct and indirect cost will be analyzed. The medical cost (direct costs) for each patient&#xD;
      since the first presentation will be obtained. The cost includes the expenses for clinic&#xD;
      follow-up, any form of outpatient and inpatient treatment (including physiotherapy, scoliosis&#xD;
      specific exercises, bracing) and complications. Unit cost of investigation, treatment and&#xD;
      follow-up will be based on the Hospital Authority official charges to non-eligible persons&#xD;
      available in the 2013 Hong Kong Government Gazette and updated charges in Hospital Authority&#xD;
      website. Brace costs include the number of orthotic visits, per visit consultation cost for&#xD;
      the orthotist fabrication of the brace, consumables for use, number of exchanges or&#xD;
      modifications, and the thermal sensor for monitoring compliance. In addition to the&#xD;
      orthotist, other allied health professionals are also part of the bracing program which&#xD;
      further increases the cost. Physiotherapists are involved to maintain body posture and&#xD;
      teach/perform scoliosis specific exercises. A clinical psychologist will periodically assess&#xD;
      the patient and family to maintain mental health. will be included in the cost analysis. For&#xD;
      subjects with failed conservative treatment meaning progression of the curve and no longer&#xD;
      indicated for bracing or further bracing will undergo surgical intervention. These subjects&#xD;
      are still analyzed but an addition cost item of &quot;surgery&quot; (one lump-sum to cover general cost&#xD;
      of implants, hospital length of stay, operating theater cost) will be included. The cost of&#xD;
      family members missing work (indirect costs) will also be assessed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cost-effectiveness analysis of initiating for bracing will be performed via Markov modelling&#xD;
      that will simulate the clinical management of AIS patients since first presentation assuming&#xD;
      at age of 11 years (female). Each patient starting at the assumed age 11 will thus follow an&#xD;
      annual cycle with a time horizon until 18 years of age. Modelling will be carried out for the&#xD;
      AIS patients as a whole, and by the 5 Cobb angle magnitude groups (20-25 degrees, &gt;25-30&#xD;
      degrees, &gt;30-35 degrees, &gt;35-40 degrees, and &gt;40 degrees). For each cycle year, patients&#xD;
      initiating bracing may wear the brace until maturity, stop wearing (compliance rate), or&#xD;
      switch to surgical approach over the years. Patients with failed bracing will proceed to&#xD;
      surgery, and stay with a post-operation health status from operation date to the end. Costs&#xD;
      and utility data for AIS patients initiating bracing will be obtained from above prospective&#xD;
      study. Clinical model parameters related to compliance rate of bracing, maturity rate of&#xD;
      bracing, probability of treatment switch from bracing to surgery will also be identified&#xD;
      through a comprehensive review of local and overseas literature as reference. Based on the&#xD;
      regression model found, the investigators will estimate the effects of bracing at variable&#xD;
      initial curvature and maturity status on direct and indirect costs, SRS-22r domain and total&#xD;
      scores, and EQ-5D utility scores. The cost-effectiveness analysis will also recommend a&#xD;
      threshold of curvature and maturity combination to indicate when bracing initiated will be&#xD;
      the most cost-effective or even cost-saving treatment option for AIS patients.&#xD;
