  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Prescribing lifestyle changes to patients who have cardiovascular disease (CVD) may be an&#xD;
      extremely cost effective mechanism of improving health individually and for the NHS. Positive&#xD;
      lifestyle changes such as improved diet, increased physical activity, quitting smoking and&#xD;
      reducing alcohol consumption have been proven to reform the health status of individuals with&#xD;
      CVD. S-PLAC 2 is a phase II study to determine the efficacy of a lifestyle prescription (Lâ„ž)&#xD;
      in patients and healthcare practitioners in a secondary care setting (i.e. hospital&#xD;
      clinics/wards).&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>The study is an interventional controlled observational study based in the Secondary care setting. Control groups will be utilized through the mechanism of wait-listing the enrolment of recruitment centres into the study.&#xD;
Mixed methods will be used for both data collection and analysis. Historical clinical participant data (pre-intervention) will be collected by the PI. data will be collected immediately after the consultation and at 3 months post intervention.</intervention_model_description>
