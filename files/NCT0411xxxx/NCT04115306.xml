  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test the safety and tolerability of PMD-026 in patients with&#xD;
      metastatic breast cancer and triple negative breast cancer. PMD-026 is a targeted oral agent&#xD;
      designed to kill tumor cells in metastatic breast cancer and triple negative breast cancer.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the safety and tolerability of PMD-026 using an accelerated&#xD;
      titration design to define the MTD in metastatic breast cancer, followed by an expansion at&#xD;
      the RP2D in triple negative breast cancer. All patients will receive daily oral doses of&#xD;
      PMD-026 until either disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients will have disease&#xD;
      assessments initially after 6 weeks of treatment, and every 9 weeks thereafter.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients enrolled to the Dose Escalation Phase must have histologically or cytologically&#xD;
      diagnosed metastatic breast cancer that has progressed on or after standard of care therapy.&#xD;
      Patients enrolled to the Dose Expansion Phase must have histologically or cytologically&#xD;
      diagnosed metastatic triple negative breast cancer from initial diagnosis (ER/PgR &lt;1%, HER2&#xD;
      negative) that has progressed on or after standard of care therapy. All patients must provide&#xD;
      tumor tissue (archival preferred) prior to study entry.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A subset (N=12) of patients in Part 2 of the study will participate in a 1- week evaluation&#xD;
      of the effect of food on PMD-026 oral absorption.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PMD-026 is an oral, reversible small molecule inhibitor of RSK1-4 with high selectivity for&#xD;
      RSK2. High levels of RSK2 expression have been associated with worse overall survival in&#xD;
      breast cancer. Inhibiting RSK2 may inhibit growth of breast cancer.&#xD;
