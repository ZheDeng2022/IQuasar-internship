      Objective: The goal of this study is to implement and test a neuro-mechanical gait assist&#xD;
      (NMGA) device to correct walking characterized by muscle weakness, incoordination or&#xD;
      excessive tone in Veterans with hemiparesis after stroke that adversely affects their ability&#xD;
      to walk, exercise, perform activities of daily living, and participate fully in personal,&#xD;
      professional and social roles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Plan: A prototype NMGA device will be used to develop a finite state controller&#xD;
      (FSC) to coordinate each user's volitional effort with surface muscle stimulation and&#xD;
      motorized knee assistance as needed. Brace mounted sensors will be used to develop a gait&#xD;
      event detector (GED) which will serve the FSC to advance through the phases of gait or stair&#xD;
      climbing. In addition, a rule-base intent detection algorithm will be developed using brace&#xD;
      mounted sensors and user interface input to select among various functions including walking,&#xD;
      stairs climbing, sit-to-stand and stand-to-sit maneuvers. The FSC controller tuning and&#xD;
      intent algorithm development and evaluation will be on pilot subjects with difficulty walking&#xD;
      after stroke. Outcome measures during development will provide specifications for a new&#xD;
      prototype NMGA design which will be evaluated on pilot subjects to test the hypothesis that&#xD;
      the NMGA improves walking speed, distance and energy consumption of walking. These baseline&#xD;
      data and device will be used to design a follow-up clinical trial to measure orthotic impact&#xD;
      of NMGA on mobility in activities of daily living at home and community.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology: After meeting inclusion criteria, pilot subjects will undergo baseline gait&#xD;
      evaluation with EMG activities of knee flexors and extensors, ankle plantar and dorsiflexors&#xD;
      and isokinetic knee strength and passive resistance. They will be fitted with a NMGA&#xD;
      combining a knee-ankle-foot-orthosis with a motorized knee joint and surface neuromuscular&#xD;
      stimulation of plantar- and dorsi- flexors, vasti and rectus femoris. Brace mounted sensor&#xD;
      data will be used for gait event detector (GED) algorithm development and evaluation. The GED&#xD;
      will serve the FSC to proceed through phases of gait based on supervisory rule-based user&#xD;
      intent recognition algorithm detected by brace mounted sensors and user input interface. The&#xD;
      FSC will coordinate feed-forward control of tuned stimulation patterns and closed-loop&#xD;
      controlled knee power assist as needed to control foot clearance during swing and stability&#xD;
      of the knee during stance. Based on data attained during controller development and&#xD;
      evaluation, a new prototype NMGA will be design, constructed and evaluated on pilot subjects&#xD;
      to test the hypothesis that a NMGA device improves safety and stability, increases walking&#xD;
      speed and distance and minimizes user effort.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical Significance: The anticipated outcome is improved gait stability with improved swing&#xD;
      knee flexion, thus, increasing the safety and preventing injurious falls of ambulatory&#xD;
      individuals with hemiplegia due to stroke found in large and ever-increasing numbers in the&#xD;
      aging Veteran population. Correcting gait should lead to improved quality of life and&#xD;
      participation.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This study includes controller development and feasibility testing for a hybrid neuromuscular&#xD;
      gait assist (NMGA) system to enhance walking after stroke. The study consists of baseline&#xD;
      testing, fitting the device on participants, tuning assistance parameters to enhance walking,&#xD;
      collecting movement data with and without the device, modifying controller designs to&#xD;
      optimize walking, sit-to-stand transitions, and stair climbing, gait training, and evaluating&#xD;
      movement capability with and without device assistance. Heart rate and blood pressure will be&#xD;
      monitored during each session.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Device Description The NMGA is comprised of a motorized knee brace and surface electrical&#xD;
      stimulation applied to muscles acting across the hip, knee, and ankle. The device is worn on&#xD;
      the impaired side of the body with an orthotic interface attaching it to the leg. The goal of&#xD;
      combining the powered knee with stimulation is to improve leg movement and coordination for&#xD;
      safer walking at reduced user effort. The powered exoskeletal knee ensures adequate toe&#xD;
      clearance during the swing phase of gait by generating knee flexion and then prevents knee&#xD;
      buckling during the stance phase of gait by maintaining extension for support. Surface muscle&#xD;
      stimulation assists with user volitional effort. Stimulation applied to ankle dorsiflexors&#xD;
      assists with toe clearance during swing while quadriceps stimulation assists with stance.&#xD;
      Gastrocnemius and rectus femoris stimulation assist with push-off and swing to improve&#xD;
      walking speed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study focuses on developing and testing control methods that integrate assistance of&#xD;
      stimulation and the powered knee with volitional activity in a manner that maximizes the&#xD;
      user's own muscle contribution. Orthosis mounted sensors measure motion, joint angles,&#xD;
      interaction forces and foot-floor contact to determine the current phase of gait and&#xD;
      assistance required. A Gait Event Detector (GED) determines the phase of gait and appropriate&#xD;
      control state based on sensor data and then a Finite State Controller (FSC) optimizes&#xD;
      stimulation and motor assistance in coordination with volitional effort. The controller&#xD;
      design incorporates feedforward control of stimulation with stimulation triggered by&#xD;
      detection of different gait events. Feedback control is applied for motor assistance only as&#xD;
      needed. This study will evaluate different algorithms to detect different phases of gait.&#xD;
      Controller refinement is an iterative process of testing different algorithms, adjusting&#xD;
      detection parameters, and adjusting assistance parameters.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to detecting phases of gait during walking, this study will also develop&#xD;
      algorithms to detect user intent for mobility task transitions. Beyond overground walking,&#xD;
      mobility includes transitions between sitting and standing as well as stair climbing.&#xD;
      Depending on command signal robustness, these transitions could be achieved through separate&#xD;
      inputs (e.g. a smart phone app or orthosis mounted buttons) to inform the device when to&#xD;
      change task states or may be detectable based on the user's motions. As part of this study&#xD;
      the investigators will test different approaches to determine the safest effective option and&#xD;
      user preferences.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following describes the participation involved in this development process.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening After signing the informed consent form the subject will undergo screening to&#xD;
      determine if an individual is eligible to participate in the study based on the&#xD;
      inclusion/exclusion criteria. During screening the investigators will also collect&#xD;
      information about stroke demographics (e.g. date of stroke, type of stroke, lesion location,&#xD;
      side of impairment), medications, and leg and foot size to ensure the investigators have&#xD;
      appropriately sized orthotic components during subsequent sessions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline testing After meeting all inclusion/exclusion criteria and agreeing to participate,&#xD;
      initial testing will determine participants' impairment level and walking ability prior to&#xD;
      controller development and training with the device. Walking tests will be completed in the&#xD;
      laboratory, hospital hallways, and the environment surrounding the hospital. Outcomes will&#xD;
      measure impairment in the legs, walking ability, and participants perceptions of the device&#xD;
      and the effect on walking.&#xD;
&#xD;
      NMGA Fitting and Tuning The study team will work with the participant to fit the device and&#xD;
      determine appropriate stimulation patterns to assist walking. Fitting includes choosing&#xD;
      orthotic components that fit well on the wearer's leg and allow comfortable walking.&#xD;
      Stimulation patterns will be generated for each individual. Electrodes will target movement&#xD;
      at the hip, knee, and ankle on the affected side. During stimulation tuning the investigators&#xD;
      will adjust surface stimulation electrode locations as well as stimulus timing and intensity&#xD;
      during the gait cycle. Orthotic fitting and stimulation pattern creation are expected to take&#xD;
      about two sessions. Assessments may be repeated with surface stimulation assistance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Controller Development During several sessions, the participant will complete mobility tasks&#xD;
      (i.e. walking, stair climbing, and sit-to-stand transitions) while walking with the NMGA and&#xD;
      recording data to characterize walking (Quantitative Motion Analysis data and orthosis&#xD;
      mounted sensor data). These data will be used to create and optimize the controller to&#xD;
      estimate phases of gaits (e.g. initial contact, pre-swing, mid-swing) based on exoskeleton&#xD;
      mounted sensors to coordinate NMGA assistance with walking ability. Participants will&#xD;
      complete tasks while different algorithms control transitions between tasks (e.g. walking to&#xD;
      stair climbing) and assistance during task completion. Controller parameters will be adjusted&#xD;
      during this process to optimize assistance and determine which task transitions the sensors&#xD;
      successfully detect and which transitions should be controlled by a separate user input.&#xD;
      Contact guard assistance will be provided to prevent falls during controller development.&#xD;
      During this process participants will be interviewed in an open discussion format to get&#xD;
      feedback about aspects of the device that could be improved. Up to 16 sessions will be used&#xD;
      for controller development.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Gait Training After determining a control algorithm, there will be six sessions of training&#xD;
      to use the device for walking, stair climbing, and sit-to-stand transitions as appropriate.&#xD;
      Gait training will be conducted by the study physical therapist in the gait laboratory,&#xD;
      hospital hallways, and surrounding outdoor spaces. The physical therapist will provide&#xD;
      standby assistance, monitor subjects' vital signs, record their progress and solicit feedback&#xD;
      on the use of the NMGA. Training will focus on increasing walking speed while maintaining&#xD;
      safety, specifically toe clearance in swing, stability in stance, and situational awareness&#xD;
      to the surrounding environment. Participants will provide feedback about when during the&#xD;
      process they feel comfortable donning, doffing, and using the device without study staff&#xD;
      assistance. The study physical therapist will also provide input about when participants are&#xD;
      capable of using the system independently.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post-Training Assessment Following training with the NMGA, the previously described&#xD;
      assessments (see Baseline Testing) will be repeated both with and without the device to test&#xD;
      the hypothesis that walking with the NMGA compared to without enhances walking speed,&#xD;
      endurance, metabolic consumption, and gait symmetry. In addition to the tests at baseline,&#xD;
      participants will complete the Quebec User Evaluation of Satisfaction with Assistive&#xD;
      Technology (QUEST), a survey to assess user satisfaction with a device. Additionally, each&#xD;
      participant will fill out a worksheet prioritizing different design requirements (e.g. size,&#xD;
      weight, ease of use). Up to six sessions will be used for final testing.&#xD;
