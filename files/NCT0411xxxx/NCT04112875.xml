      This study aims was evaluated the effect of L-arginine on microcirculation, vasoreactivity /&#xD;
      endothelial function and vascular smooth muscle of young and old women with Sarcopenia or&#xD;
      Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus measured by Nailfold videocapillaroscopy and venous occlusion&#xD;
      plethysmography before and after 14 days of consumption 5g oral L-arginine supplementation.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Aging causes responsible endothelial changes, in part by a decrease in the blood flow of the&#xD;
      skeletal muscles of the elderly. Reduction of muscle mass / function (Sarcopenia) and&#xD;
      Diabetes Mellitus are frequent pathologies in the elderly. L-Arginine is a semi-essential&#xD;
      amino acid precursor to nitric oxide synthesis (NO), an important vasodilator and protector&#xD;
      cardiovascular.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Seventy-five women were allocated into three groups: twenty-five healthy young (HY) recruited&#xD;
      among University students, and fifty women elderly, this was stratified in twenty-five&#xD;
      healthy elderly (HE) control and twenty-five with hyperglycemia (HG) elderly from the&#xD;
      ambulatories of the Geriatric and Diabetology at the State University of Rio de Janeiro&#xD;
      (UERJ) and private supplementary health program. To control group was considered absence&#xD;
      cardiovascular risk factor except advanced age. Participants were subjected to screening&#xD;
      phase before being eligible for the study by telephone, which comprised of individual&#xD;
      clinical history. All subjects signed the written Informed Consent Form enclosed in the&#xD;
      protocol approved by Ethics Committee from the State University of Rio de Janeiro according&#xD;
      to Helsinki Declaration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The subjects elected for research made 4 visits to the Biovasc laboratory for data&#xD;
      collection. First day: the protocol was explained and agreement from the voluntary obtained,&#xD;
      followed and anamnesis and physical exam that included measure at-rest blood pressure, weight&#xD;
      and height. Moreover, women examined after 6 hours fasting the microcirculation function&#xD;
      using nailfold vidiocapilaroscopy (NVC), followed of the measure of forearm blood flow (FBF)&#xD;
      and vascular reactivity by venous occlusion plethysmography (VOP). Second day: Venous blood&#xD;
      sample collection after 12 hours fasting. In sequence, they realized whole-body dual-energy&#xD;
      X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) to calculate the body composition main measure lean and fat mass.&#xD;
      After, was delivered a box with 14 sachets content 5g L-arginine supplementation, and it was&#xD;
      recommended to ingest with water 30 minutes before breakfast during 14 days. Third day:&#xD;
      Return after the supplementation to realize measurement weight, and exams NVC and VOP. Fourth&#xD;
      day: blood sample were taken after 12 hours fasting under effect of the L-arginine.&#xD;
