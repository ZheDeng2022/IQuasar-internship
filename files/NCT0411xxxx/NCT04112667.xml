    <textblock>
      Delayed rod-mediated dark adaptation (RMDA), or delayed recovery of vision in a dark&#xD;
      environment, is a functional biomarker (i.e., risk factor) for early age-related macular&#xD;
      degeneration (AMD). This research plan is designed to elucidate the structural (anatomical)&#xD;
      basis of this visual deficit using cellular- and subcellular level imaging of the retina and&#xD;
      its supporting tissues in living people. An accurate map and timeline of structure-function&#xD;
      relationships in persons tested for night vision will result in functionally validated&#xD;
      structural endpoints for early AMD trials, as well as define major biologic effects for&#xD;
      development into future treatments.&#xD;

      The Alabama Study on Early Age-Related Macular Degeneration 2 (ALSTAR2) is a prospective&#xD;
      cohort study with baseline measurements that are repeated at follow-up 3 years later. The&#xD;
      baseline and 3 year follow-up visits will each consist of 2 visits for a total of 4 visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study assessments are listed below. All are collected at two visits at both baseline and&#xD;
      follow-up for 4 visits total (blood collection for DNA analysis at baseline only). For some&#xD;
      functional tests (photopic and mesonic acuity, photopic and mesonic contrast sensitivity),&#xD;
      each eye will be tested separately. For other functional tests (dark-adapted two-color&#xD;
      perimetry, light-adapted cone-mediate perimetry, rod-mediated dark adaptation), only one eye&#xD;
      will be tested, which will be designated by the study eye. Tropicamide 1% and phenylephrine&#xD;
      hydrochloride 2.5% are used to dilate pupils (diameter of â‰¥ 6 mm) as needed for specific&#xD;
      parts of the protocol. After completing the baseline visits, participants will receive an&#xD;
      annual phone call from the study coordinator so that contact information can be updated.&#xD;
      Participants will receive an annual newsletter containing study related information (this&#xD;
      will be submitted to the IRB for approval).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Assessments:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Rod-mediated dark adaptation (RMDA), the ability to recover light sensitivity after&#xD;
           exposure to a bright light.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Dark-adapted two-color microperimetry, a measure of light sensitivity for lights of two&#xD;
           different colors.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Photopic and mesopic acuity in central vision, as measured by letter charts..&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Photopic and mesopic contrast sensitivity in central vision, as measured by letter&#xD;
           charts..&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Multimodal ocular imaging on both eyes, which consists of the following: color fundus&#xD;
           photography, spectral domain optical coherence tomography (SDOCT), blue fundus&#xD;
           autofluorescence (standard and quantitative), OCT-angiography (OCT-A).&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Blood draw for the analysis of C-reactive protein, high-density lipoprotein, carotenoid&#xD;
           level, DNA extraction, and examination of the presence of genetic risk associated with&#xD;
           age-related macular degeneration (AMD).&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Questionnaires: Demographics, medical co-morbidities, cognitive status screen,&#xD;
           medication use, alcohol use, smoking, self-reported visual difficulty in the visual&#xD;
           activities of daily living&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Young normal group will only complete:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Rod-mediated dark adaptation (RMDA), the ability to recover light sensitivity after&#xD;
           exposure to a bright light.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Dark-adapted two-color microperimetry, a measure of light sensitivity for lights of two&#xD;
           different colors.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. . Photopic and mesopic acuity in central vision, as measured by letter charts..&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Photopic and mesopic contrast sensitivity in central vision, as measured by letter&#xD;
           charts..&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Multimodal ocular imaging on both eyes, which consists of the following: color fundus&#xD;
           photography, spectral domain optical coherence tomography (SDOCT), blue fundus&#xD;
