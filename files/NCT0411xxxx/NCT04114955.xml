    <textblock>
      This is a randomized controlled trial of a multi-level intervention to prevent HIV&#xD;
      acquisition among transgender women (N=400) in São Paulo, Brazil. The intervention will be&#xD;
      evaluated using a randomized wait-list controlled trial to compare uptake of HIV testing&#xD;
      (self-testing and clinic-based) (Aim 1), PrEP initiation and persistence (Aim 2), and other&#xD;
      prevention services (e.g. harm reduction) among trans women in the intervention arm compared&#xD;
      to those in the control arm with data collection scheduled every three-months. Investigators&#xD;
      will assess changes in intersectional stigma (Aim 3), including reductions in internalized&#xD;
      stigma and increased resilience to anticipated and enacted stigma, among those assigned to&#xD;
      intervention compared to those assigned to the control arm, and assess how changes in stigma&#xD;
      result in prevention uptake.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Globally, transgender ('trans') women experience extreme social and economic marginalization&#xD;
      due to intersectional stigma, defined as the confluence of stigma that results from the&#xD;
      intersection of social identities and positions among those who are multiply oppressed. Among&#xD;
      trans women, gender-based stigma intersects with social positions such as engagement in sex&#xD;
      work and substance use, generating a social context of vulnerability and increased risk of&#xD;
      HIV acquisition. In Brazil, trans women are the 'most-at-risk' group for HIV, with 55 times&#xD;
      higher estimated odds of HIV infection than the general population; further, uptake of HIV&#xD;
      testing and pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) among trans women is significantly lower than&#xD;
      other at-risk groups, despite availability in the public sector and documented interest in&#xD;
      the community. Through extensive formative work, the investigators have developed a suite of&#xD;
      evidence-informed interventions and HIV prevention strategies, all of which have demonstrated&#xD;
      feasibility and acceptability by trans women in Brazil, to address intersectional stigma and&#xD;
      increase engagement of trans women in the HIV prevention continuum. We propose to test a&#xD;
      multi-level intervention, 'Guerreiras' ('warrior women', as named by trans women participants&#xD;
      in Brazil), comprised of two intervention components designed to address intersectional&#xD;
      stigma: 1) a group-level, peer-led intervention and 2) an individual-level peer navigation&#xD;
      program to increase uptake of HIV testing and PrEP. Guerreiras is informed by a&#xD;
      trans-specific conceptual model, gender affirmation theory, that describes intersectional&#xD;
      stigma faced by trans women and frames investigations of how intersectional stigma results in&#xD;
      health disparities, providing a framework for the development and testing of interventions to&#xD;
      address intersectional stigma among trans women. The study team will recruit trans women&#xD;
      (N=400) from clinical sites, outreach events, and an ongoing observational cohort in São&#xD;
      Paulo, Brazil. Guerreiras will be evaluated using a randomized wait-list controlled trial to&#xD;
      compare uptake of HIV testing (self-testing and clinic-based) (Aim 1), PrEP initiation and&#xD;
      persistence (Aim 2), and other prevention services (e.g. harm reduction) among trans women in&#xD;
      the intervention arm compared to those in the control arm with data collection scheduled&#xD;
      every three-months. Investigators will assess changes in intersectional stigma (Aim 3),&#xD;
      including reductions in internalized stigma and increased resilience to anticipated and&#xD;
      enacted stigma, among those assigned to intervention compared to those assigned to the&#xD;
      control arm, and assess how changes in stigma result in prevention uptake. Outcomes will be&#xD;
      monitored through the national medications dispensing system (PrEP initiation and&#xD;
      persistence), through clinical records and self-report (HIV testing), and through&#xD;
      comprehensive surveys (intersectional stigma). The proposed research leverages a productive&#xD;
      multi-disciplinary HIV research partnership with extensive experience working with trans&#xD;
      women in Brazil, multi-level intervention components, and a context where PrEP and HIVST are&#xD;
      available publicly, providing an opportunity to evaluate and scale-up an HIV prevention&#xD;
      initiative in a key health disparity population, while contributing to nascent research in&#xD;
      intersectional stigma.&#xD;
