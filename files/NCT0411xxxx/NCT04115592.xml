  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to investigate if the application of lipid in various form (i.e.&#xD;
      liquid and solid) affects glycaemia, lipaemia and insulinaemia. In addition, this study aims&#xD;
      to test the lipidemic effects of the use of vegetable oil as a substitute in the application&#xD;
      for making chocolate confectionery.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will have a randomized, non-blinded, crossover design. This study will explicitly&#xD;
      compare the effects of different forms of fat (liquid and solid) on glucose, insulin and&#xD;
      lipid response on 20 healthy male participants between the age of 21-40 years. In addition,&#xD;
      this study aims to test the lipidemic effects of the use of vegetable oil as a substitute in&#xD;
      the application for making chocolate confectionery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All potential participants will be asked to attend four testing sessions and a screening&#xD;
      session in total. During the first screening session, participants will receive an informed&#xD;
      consent form and given ample time to go through it and rectify any queries they have. If they&#xD;
      decide to take part in the study, they will be asked to sign the informed consent form. They&#xD;
      will then be asked to complete a screening questionnaire, baseline measurements including&#xD;
      anthropometric measurements, blood pressure, and fasting blood glucose will be collected from&#xD;
      each participant in order to determine their eligibility. During the test sessions,&#xD;
      participants' glycaemic, insulinaemic and lipaemic responses to the test meals will be&#xD;
      measured. The test duration for each session will be 6.5 hours. Participants will be&#xD;
      instructed to avoid strenuous physical activity for at least 3 days and avoid caffeine and&#xD;
      alcohol consumption for at least 1 day prior to visiting the CNRC for their study trials.&#xD;
      Participants will be provided with a standardized dinner meal (consisting of rice/noodles,&#xD;
      vegetables, meat, drink/pudding) and to refrain from alcohol and exercise the day before&#xD;
      their testing sessions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening questionnaire: The screening questionnaire will include contact information,&#xD;
      demographic and general health details. This information will be used to determine whether&#xD;
      the participant is eligible for the study, as well as to check for any possible confounders&#xD;
      that may influence the study outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anthropometric measurements: Body weight and body composition will be measured using&#xD;
      bioelectrical impedance analysis. Height will be measured using a stadiometer in order to&#xD;
      calculate participants' BMI. Blood pressure will also be measured. All measurements will be&#xD;
      taken in duplicate during the screening session. Waist circumference will be measured at the&#xD;
      minimum circumference between the iliac crest and the rib cage. Hip circumference will be&#xD;
      measured at the maximum protuberance of the buttocks. Biceps and triceps skinfold&#xD;
      measurements will also be taken. Blood pressure will be measured using an Omron blood&#xD;
      pressure monitor (Model HEM-907) at baseline. Participants will be seated for five minutes&#xD;
      before blood pressure is measured. Measurements will be taken in duplicate and the averaged&#xD;
      results will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood collection: Participants will be asked to attend the testing sessions after an&#xD;
      overnight fast of ten hours. At the beginning of the testing session, a cannula will be&#xD;
      inserted into participants' arms. One fasting blood sample will be collected by venous&#xD;
      cannulation. 3 milliliters (ml) of venous blood will be collected into Vacutainers® (Belton&#xD;
      Dickinson Diagnostics) containing disodium EDTA for the analyses of plasma triglyceride,&#xD;
      glucose and insulin concentrations. Participants will then consume treatment meal within 15&#xD;
      minutes. Blood samples will be taken at baseline, 15, 30, 45, 60, 90, 120, 150, 180, 210,&#xD;
      240, 270, 300, 330 and 360 minutes. The amount of blood that will be collected at every time&#xD;
      point will be approximately 3ml. A maximum of 15 blood samples will be collected by&#xD;
      cannulation. A total of 180ml of blood will be taken for the study. Glycaemic, insulinaemic,&#xD;
      and lipaemic responses will be determined using the method described by Wolever and Jenkins.&#xD;
      The area under the curve will be determined as the area of those increments above baseline&#xD;
      only.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Test session: Participants will be provided a standard dinner meal to be consumed at home at&#xD;
      7pm the night before the test session. Afterwhich, they will be asked to not eat and drink&#xD;
      anything except water after 10:30 pm. They will also be instructed to arrive at the CNRC the&#xD;
      following morning after an overnight fast of 10-12 hours. After 10 minutes upon arrival, an&#xD;
      indwelling catheter will be inserted into a vein in your forearm and will be kept patent&#xD;
      (free of clots) for the remainder of the test session. We will then take a blood sample from&#xD;
      the cannula to measure baseline values. After obtaining the baseline blood samples,&#xD;
      participants will be given the test meal to consume within 15 minutes. Following the test&#xD;
      meal, we will take further blood samples (from the cannula) for the next 15, 30, 45, 60, 90,&#xD;
      120, 150, 180, 210, 240, 270, 300, 330, 360 minutes. The cannula will be removed after the&#xD;
      last time-point of blood sample collection (360 minutes) and they are free to leave CNRC.&#xD;
      During the entire testing period the participants will be instructed to remain rested and in&#xD;
      the laboratory. There will be no incidental findings as analysed samples are basic&#xD;
      metabolites and therefore, reporting is not applicable.&#xD;
