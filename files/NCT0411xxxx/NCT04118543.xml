  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Obesity is a major cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factor that is rising fastest in&#xD;
      children. Prevention of its damaging effects should begin earlier before they become&#xD;
      irreversible. Pilot data identified novel markers of cardiometabolic dysfunction that may be&#xD;
      better than body mass index at stratifying risk and as targets for CVD prevention in the&#xD;
      young. Advanced imaging, blood tests and a meal-challenge will be used to comprehensively&#xD;
      characterise how early metabolic dysfunction (liver and muscle fat, insulin resistance)&#xD;
      affects cardiovascular health (arterial stiffness, myocardial energetics, gut vasoreactivity,&#xD;
      diastolic function, blood pressure trajectory, left ventricular hypertrophy) in 210&#xD;
      adolescents (110 obese, 50 sedentary normal-weight, 50 high-activity). Reversibility of this&#xD;
      phenotype will be tested in the obese by randomised controlled trial, comparing 8-week&#xD;
      supervised exercise to a low-activity sham intervention. This study will provide the platform&#xD;
      for developing practical, effective CVD prevention in children that is not simply focused on&#xD;
      weight-loss.&#xD;

      Objectives and Outcome measures&#xD;
&#xD;
      This proposal aims to (1) improve identification of early cardiometabolic dysfunction in&#xD;
      children and (2) investigate the reversibility of this dysfunction through exercise. The&#xD;
      study will provide the platform for developing practical, effective primordial CVD prevention&#xD;
      strategies and the identification of novel early therapeutic targets.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study combines elements of both observational and interventional study designs. A&#xD;
      prospective, cross-sectional study of adolescents with 1-year follow-up is combined with a&#xD;
      randomised placebo (sham-exercise)-controlled trial (RCT) of eight-weeks of supervised,&#xD;
      individualised exercise in an obese sub-population. The RCT is of an established,&#xD;
      standardised exercise programme that is low-risk. Group allocation will be known only to the&#xD;
      exercise physiologist and staff carrying out the exercise intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fitness tests will be carried out in schools and in our exercise laboratory, which will&#xD;
      provide opportunities to support questionnaire completion, fit accelerometers, fit and return&#xD;
      ambulatory blood pressure monitors and address participant questions or concerns. In&#xD;
      addition, participants will visit The Oxford Centre for Clinical Magnetic Resonance Research&#xD;
      (OCMR) for the initial assessment and for the follow-up assessment for those participants in&#xD;
      the obese group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants&#xD;
&#xD;
      210 participants will be recruited, 110 of these will be obese, 50 will be normal weight and&#xD;
      their activity will be matched to the obese group and therefore, relatively sedentary. 50&#xD;
      normal weight controls will be selected on the basis of high levels of physical activity. The&#xD;
      110 obese participants will be randomised (1:1) to exercise intervention or a low-intensity&#xD;
      sham exercise placebo intervention. These numbers are justified by a priori power&#xD;
      calculations and take into account potential withdrawals at an attrition rate of 10% that is&#xD;
      compatible with recent studies in the same or similar populations (e.g. Fit to Study).&#xD;
      Compliance with the interventions will be increased by carrying out the interventions through&#xD;
      an online remote methodology which can also be implemented in a school setting, predominantly&#xD;
      during mandatory physical education (PE) lessons. Trained, experienced staff will supervise&#xD;
      the exercise sessions, ensuring participant engagement with the activities by measuring heart&#xD;
      rate and physical activity levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pre-screening will be done through schools who will write to families informing them that&#xD;
      their children will be taking part in an enhanced P.E. lesson at school that includes a&#xD;
      fitness and health screening session. As part of this, the children will be asked to wear an&#xD;
      activity watch (accelerometer) for a week. The session will explore many aspects of their&#xD;
      agility and fitness and assess their muscle strength, power, motor skills, speed, endurance&#xD;
      and flexibility, adjusted for their physical size (height and weight). The lesson will be&#xD;
      educational, giving personalised feedback to the children on their strengths and how to&#xD;
      improve on areas where they are less strong. The school will retain a file linking the&#xD;
      children's names to random identifiers but the researchers will not have access to, or&#xD;
      retain, any identifiable information. Parents will be sent a letter giving them the&#xD;
      opportunity to withdraw their children from this health screening session and explaining that&#xD;
      researchers may ask the school to contact them again on their behalf if their children are&#xD;
      eligible for study participation on the basis of their fitness assessment. Children who are&#xD;
      withdrawn by their parents will participate in their usual P.E. lesson.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment will be done by letters to parents, delivered via the schools. Recruitment from&#xD;
      an established population already in contact with the investigators research group should&#xD;
      increase participation rates. It is difficult to precisely estimate the proportion of&#xD;
      participants who fulfil the inclusion/exclusion criteria but it is assumed an obesity rate&#xD;
      (BMI z-score (WHO) &gt; 2) of approximately 20%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to the school screening recruitment, participants may also volunteer to take part&#xD;
      in the study through our online advertisement and social media campaign. Children who express&#xD;
      an interest will be invited to contact the study team so that an initial health assessment&#xD;
      can be completed and an information pack can be provided. This pack will contain participant&#xD;
      information sheets and consent forms, and will collect information needed for BMI z-score&#xD;
      calculation. Then potentially eligible participants will be invited to complete physical&#xD;
      activity questionnaires to determine eligibility and group allocation. This is to avoid any&#xD;
      unnecessary testing on ineligible participants at university sites and provides a suitable&#xD;
      remote method to differentiate between active and inactive participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pre-stratification of the potential population for recruitment will be carried out, based on&#xD;
      BMI and activity levels. Obese and normal weight groups will be approached for recruitment&#xD;
      sequentially, according to their rank position within their respective BMI-based criteria in&#xD;
      order to maximise the difference between groups (e.g. the most obese will be approached first&#xD;
      for the obese group). The normal weight group will be further stratified according to&#xD;
      activity levels such that half of this group matches the obesity group for activity whilst&#xD;
      the other half are highly-active individuals. Again, individuals within this subgroup will be&#xD;
      approached according to their rank position in the distribution of activity such that the&#xD;
      most active are preferred in order to maximise the difference between groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Informed Consent&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participant's parents/guardians will be asked to sign and date the latest approved version of&#xD;
      the Informed Consent before any study-specific procedures are performed. The latest approved&#xD;
      Participant Information sheet will be provided to them and verbal explanations will also be&#xD;
      provided ensuring that all of the following information has been presented and understood:&#xD;
      the exact nature of the study; what it will involve for the participant; the implications and&#xD;
      constraints of the protocol; and all known risks or benefits involved in taking part.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be told that they are free to withdraw from the study at any time and for&#xD;
      any reason without being required to give a reason for their withdrawal. The participant will&#xD;
      be allowed as much time as they wish to consider the information, and the opportunity to&#xD;
      question the Investigator, their General Practitioner (GP) or other independent parties to&#xD;
      decide whether they will participate in the study. Once these conditions are satisfied,&#xD;
      written Informed Consent will be obtained by means of participant dated signature and dated&#xD;
      signature of the person who presented and obtained the Informed Consent. The person taking&#xD;
      consent will be a qualified member of the study team with a complete understanding of the&#xD;
      study and with the authorisation of the Principal Investigator. A copy of the signed Informed&#xD;
      Consent will be given to the participant and the original signed form will be retained at the&#xD;
      study site.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomisation&#xD;
&#xD;
      Random allocation of members of the obese group to a sham fitness intervention or to a&#xD;
      standardised exercise intervention will be carried out using an online randomisation process.&#xD;
      The analysis will be carried out on an &quot;intention-to-treat&quot; basis when participants do not&#xD;
      complete all elements of the data collection process and single-blinding will be maintained&#xD;
      such that members of the team carrying out procedures at OCMR e.g. MRI and those involved in&#xD;
      the data analysis are blinded to the allocation of intervention and sham groups. All data&#xD;
      acquired at OCMR will be identified by a unique study number only. Inadvertent un-blinding&#xD;
      will result in the exclusion of that individual's data from the analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Incidental findings&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cardiovascular findings will be dealt with by the PI or another MRI-trained Consultant&#xD;
      Paediatric Cardiologist. Findings in other imaging will be reviewed by the study Paediatric&#xD;
      Radiologist. OCMR standard operation procedures (SOPs) for dealing with cardiac and&#xD;
      non-cardiac incidental findings, respectively will be followed. Participants will not be&#xD;
      informed of incidental findings on the day and will only be contacted after they have been&#xD;
      formally reviewed and if a concern remains that further investigation is required.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Discontinuation or withdrawal of participants from the study&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each participant will have the right to withdraw from the study at any time. In addition,&#xD;
      participation in the study may be discontinued at any time if the Investigator considers it&#xD;
      necessary for any reason, including but not limited to: Pregnancy, ineligibility (either&#xD;
      arising during the study or retrospectively, having been overlooked at screening), a&#xD;
      significant protocol deviation, significant non-compliance with the exercise regimen or other&#xD;
      study requirements, withdrawal of consent, and loss to follow-up. Data gathered to that point&#xD;
      will be included in the analysis under an intention-to-treat principle. Where possible,&#xD;
      further recruitment will be carried out to compensate for data loss resulting from early&#xD;
      discontinuation of participation. The reason for all withdrawals will be recorded in the Case&#xD;
      Report Form.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Confounding Factors&#xD;
&#xD;
      The exercise intervention RCT will be carried out over 8 weeks. The MRI scan operator will be&#xD;
      blinded to RCT group allocations and all analyses will be carried out on anonymised data.&#xD;
      Confounding factors in the observational part of the study will be addressed by matching of&#xD;
      groups for age, sex, height, pubertal status and by matching the normal-weight sedentary&#xD;
      group on activity level with the obese group. Questionnaires on cardiometabolic risk factors&#xD;
      such as diet and sedentary behaviour will be used to quantify potential confounders. At least&#xD;
      24 hours prior to study visits, participants will be asked to avoid strenuous exercise, not&#xD;
      smoke or drink alcohol, and eat a standardised evening meal before fasting in the morning.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analyses in the RCT will be carried out on an &quot;intention-to-treat&quot; basis. Secondary&#xD;
      exploratory analysis will be to explore mechanisms&#xD;
