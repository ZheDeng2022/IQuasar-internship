  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The myopic CNV (mCNV) is a blood vessel neoplasm starting from the choroid, based on&#xD;
      pathological myopia (severe myopia).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Choroidal neovascularization secondary to pathological myopia is the most common cause of&#xD;
      severe visual impairment in myopic patients younger than 50 years old. Because untreated&#xD;
      small fibrovascular membranes cause rapid damage to the photoreceptors, timely treatment is&#xD;
      required in view of poor spontaneous prognosis1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Metamorphopsia is the first functional impairment which occurs in mCNV - visual acuity loss&#xD;
      and scotoma follow later.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is a need for better and quicker quantifying of the metamorphopsia in mCNV patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to detect metamorphopsia and verify correlations of different&#xD;
      indexes with disease activity or not, measured in Optical Cohorence Tomography (OCT), best&#xD;
      corrected visual acuity (BCVA), Vision related quality of life questionnaire (NEI-VFY-25) and&#xD;
      quantify severity of metamophopsia.&#xD;

      The myopic CNV is a neovascularization starting from the choroid and growing into the space&#xD;
      between choroid and retina, based on pathological myopia (severe myopia). Choroidal&#xD;
      neovascularization secondary to pathological myopia (mCNV) is the most common cause of severe&#xD;
      visual impairment in myopic patients younger than 50 years old.1 As untreated subretinal&#xD;
      fibrovascular membranes cause rapid damage to the photoreceptors, timely treatment is&#xD;
      required in view of poor spontaneous prognosis.1&#xD;
&#xD;
      Metamorphopsia is the first functional impairment which occurs in mCNV - visual acuity loss&#xD;
      and scotoma follow later. The Amsler Grid, a qualitative paper test developed the swiss&#xD;
      ophthalmologist Marc Amsler (1891 - 1968), is a square-shaped grid used to detect or monitor&#xD;
      metamorphopsia or scotoma involving the central visual field in various disorders of the&#xD;
      macula and optic nerve head11.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Myopic CNV patients use the Amsler Grid as a home monitoring device for qualitative detection&#xD;
      of metamorphopsia by checking the grid regularly11. Due to subretinal scarring in mCNV&#xD;
      interpretation is often difficult and early changes cannot be detected and quantified. Until&#xD;
      now there are no quantitative measurements for mCNV monitoring in clinical use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently, two devices to detect and monitor metamorphopsia using smart phones and PCs,&#xD;
      respectively, have been developed for use in choroidal neovascularization in age-related&#xD;
      macular degeneration.5,6&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Alleye® Test Alleye® Test is a mobile medical software application indicated for the&#xD;
           detection and characterization of metamorphopsia. For the mean Alleye score (±standard&#xD;
           deviation (SD) deviations of dots from an ideal line are calculated for each eye.5&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  AMD-A Metamorphopsia Detector® Is based on the Amsler grid. The software uses the&#xD;
           concept of a negative image: a distorted image can be straightened by moving the mouse.&#xD;
           Degree and dimension of distorted lines or scotoma are transformed into indices.6&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study was designed to find out whether these metamorphopsia applications are suitable&#xD;
      for patients with mCNV and to find out if mCNV patients can benefit for a quicker detecting&#xD;
      of the metamorphopsia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, the aim of this study is to detect metamorphopsia and verify correlations of&#xD;
      different indexes with disease activity or not, measured in Optical Cohorence Tomography&#xD;
      (OCT), best corrected visual Acuity (BCVA), Vision related quality of life questionnaire&#xD;
      (NEI-VFY-25) and quantify severity of metamophopsia.&#xD;
