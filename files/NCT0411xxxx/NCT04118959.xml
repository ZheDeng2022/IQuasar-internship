    <textblock>
      ET is the final stage of IVF which independently influences the treatment outcome. Successful&#xD;
      embryo implantation is dependent on uterine receptivity. Atosiban is a novel class of drug&#xD;
      which is effective in priming the uterus for implantation. It reduces uterine contractions&#xD;
      and increases endomyometrial perfusion, both of which have potential benefits regarding&#xD;
      improved IRs, CPR, and ongoing pregnancy rates. Atosiban has a good embryonic safety profile.&#xD;
      It has no systemic toxicity, no mutagenic effects, and no carcinogenic effects&#xD;

    <textblock>
      ET is a critical step of an IVF cycle that merits the utmost attention. Its success depends&#xD;
      on the frequency of uterine contractions, the endometrial receptivity and the quality of&#xD;
      embryos transferred.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Uterine contractions are the most fundamental constituents of the uterine receptivity.&#xD;
      Excessive contractions may decrease the implantation potential of embryos by expelling the&#xD;
      embryos from the uterus. Studies have revealed a six-fold increase in uterine contractility&#xD;
      in IVF cycles when measured before ET as compared to the condition before ovulation in&#xD;
      natural cycles. Excessive manipulation of the cervix such as the use of tenaculum during&#xD;
      difficult ET can also trigger uterine contractions, consequently leading to failure of embryo&#xD;
      implantation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IVF success rates have been potentially improved by the use of drugs that inhibit pronounced&#xD;
      uterine contractions at the time of ET. Treatment strategies such as the use of beta-agonists&#xD;
      or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents for tocolysis have not been beneficial in IVF-ET&#xD;
      procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Atosiban is a combined oxytocin/vasopressin V1A antagonist. It functions mainly by blocking&#xD;
      oxytocin and vasopressin V1a receptors to decrease the frequency and amplitude of uterine&#xD;
      contractions, which enhances implantation and pregnancy rates. RIF remains unexplained in&#xD;
      most cases, which results in considerable variation in how RIF is treated and managed.&#xD;
      Atosiban competes with oxytocin at oxytocin receptors in endometrial cells and inhibits&#xD;
      oxytocin-induced PGF2α release, thus inhibiting uterine contractions and increasing chances&#xD;
      of embryo implantation and may add value in improving the outcome in RIF patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently published studies showed that atosiban inhibits oxytocin-induced PGF2α and uterine&#xD;
      contractility, consequently leading to improved IRs. Studies have shown a considerable&#xD;
      reduction in the frequency of uterine contractions before and after the administration of&#xD;
      atosiban in women undergoing ET.&#xD;
