      A Phase 1 Study to Determine the Single-dose Pharmacodynamics, Pharmacokinetics, and Safety&#xD;
      and Tolerability of Remimazolam Following Oral Administration With and Without Alcohol in&#xD;
      Healthy Female Subjects&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Evaluating the potential for additive or synergistic effects of alcohol when coadministered&#xD;
      with remimazolam. Female subjects were selected because they represent the population at&#xD;
      greatest risk for victimization in drug-facilitated sexual assault. In addition, females have&#xD;
      a slower ethanol metabolism, therefore, the effects of remimazolam, if coadministered with&#xD;
      alcohol, may last longer. Hence, this population represents the worst-case scenario in&#xD;
      evaluating the risk of remimazolam misuse in drug-facilitated assault.&#xD;
