  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study the researchers want to learn more about reward-driven eating behavior in&#xD;
      children ages 2 to 24 months. The researchers hope to use this knowledge to help inform&#xD;
      obesity prevention programs.&#xD;

      The study will comprise two arms and each arm has a different time perspective. The&#xD;
      longitudinal arm is prospective in nature and the cross-sectional arm has a cross-sectional&#xD;
      time perspective. The video observation is completed at a single time point (although&#xD;
      standardized by inclusion criteria).&#xD;

    <description>The researchers will be evaluating baseline indicators of wanting salience and liking between 2 and 6 month olds, with the goal of following up with these families at 24 months and beyond by reviewing the dyads' medical charts. The researchers will also examine direct and indirect associations between reward-driven eating, and maternal and infant characteristics and infant weight-for-length.</description>

    <ipd_description>The research will generate demographic, anthropometric, dietary, behavioral questionnaire, and coded behavioral data. (Note the researchers will not make video data available.) The data will be stored as Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) or Statistical Analysis System (SAS) files. Meta data will also be included in the selected repositories.The meta data will include the data dictionaries, which describe the generation of all variables, as well as the protocol manuals describing the behavioral protocols used to generate the variables.</ipd_description>
    <ipd_time_frame>Data submitted to Deep Blue Data will be reviewed after 10 years to determine if a dataset should be retained and will be subject to further, periodic, reviews thereafter.</ipd_time_frame>
