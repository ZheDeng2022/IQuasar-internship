  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study, the investigators compare timely acquirement and effectiveness of 12-lead ECG&#xD;
      using patchy-type wireless versus using defibrillator which contain ECG examination function&#xD;
      in ambulance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to determine the difference of timely acquirement of 12-lead ECG&#xD;
      using two different systems and the difference of efficiency of ECG examination in ambulance&#xD;
      between two groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participants in this simulation study were divided randomly into 2 groups :&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group A is performing an ECG examination on mock patient using defibrillator which contained&#xD;
      12-lead ECG checking function. And take a 15 minutes wash out period. After the wash out&#xD;
      period, group A subject performing an ECG examination using patchy-type wireless device.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group B subject is performing an ECG examination on mock patient using patchy-type wireless&#xD;
      device first, and take a 15 minutes wash out period. After the wash out period, group B&#xD;
      performing an ECG examination using defibrillator which contain 12-lead ECG function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both group's ECG examination is performing in the ambulance.&#xD;

First ECG performance will be using defibrillator which contain 12-lead ECG checking function. And taking a 15 minutes wash out period. Second ECG performance after wash out period, will be using patchy-type wireless device.&#xD;
when ECG examination performance ended, survey of patchy-type wireless ECG device usability will be collect.</description>
