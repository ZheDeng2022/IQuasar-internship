  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The prevalence of CTX in our country is estimated to be 1 / 50.000. The aim of this study is&#xD;
      to screen more volunteers by conducting a larger screening from neurology and pediatric&#xD;
      metabolism clinics in Turkey.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This observational study was designed retrospectively and prospectively in two stages. In the&#xD;
      retrospective section, the patient database and / or patient files will be screened in the&#xD;
      neurology and pediatric metabolism clinics and the patients aged 40 and below in the&#xD;
      neurology clinics with at least two of the following will be enrolled to the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Ataxia and / or spasticity&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Bilateral cataract (except senile cataract)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Intellectual limitation&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Non-enhancing hyperintensity on T2 sections in MR imaging of dentate nuclei&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Autosomal recessive transition pattern. (Ex: Relative Marriage)&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the pediatric metabolism centers, cases suspected of CTX and planned to apply the Mignarri&#xD;
      Index according to the investigator's opinion will be identified.&#xD;

    <description>Mignarri is a suspicion index, composed of weight-ed scores assigned to indicators such as family history and common systemic and neurological features. The indicators were classified as very strong (score 100), strong (50) or moderate (25). The suspicion index will be applied to study population. Early systemic signs such as catamct, diarrhea and neonatal cholestatic jaundice were considered strong indica- tors, together with neurological features such as intellectual impairment, psychiatric disturbances, ataxia, spastic paraparesis and dentate nuclei abnormalities at MRI. Tendon xanthomas were regarded as very strong indicators, as was an affected sibling. A total score 100 warranted serum cholestanol assessment. Elevated cholestanol or a total score 200, with one very strong or four strong indicators, warranted CYP27Al gene analysis. (Reference: Mignarri et al. J Inherit Metab Dis (2014) 37:421-429)&#xD;
