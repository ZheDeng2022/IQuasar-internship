      PURPOSE: To study circumferential trabeculotomy for congenital glaucoma using Glaucolight&#xD;
      illuminated microcatheter.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Setting: Ophthalmology department, Faculty of Medicine, Minia University, 61519, El-Minia,&#xD;
      Egypt.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN: Prospective, randomized, consecutive interventional study&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODS:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This was a prorospective study of 25 eyes of 25 patients with primary congenital or juvenile&#xD;
      glaucoma those underwent circumferential trabeculotomy done with an illuminated microcatheter&#xD;
      through a period of 24 months. Patients data of 12 months follow-up were recorded. The&#xD;
      primary target was mean intraocular pressure (IOP) study in which unqualified (complete&#xD;
      success) was defined as an IOP ≤21 mm Hg and at least a 30% reduction without the use of&#xD;
      antiglaucoma drugs and a qualified success when medications were used to reach this aim. The&#xD;
      secondary target was studding the corneal diameter (CD) and cup disc ratio (C/D) change.&#xD;

      Subjects and Methods This was a prorospective study of 25 eyes of 25 patients with primary&#xD;
      congenital or juvenile glaucoma those underwent circumferential 360° trabeculotomy done with&#xD;
      an illuminated microcatheter (DORC International, Zuidland, Netherlands) through a period of&#xD;
      24 months from June 2017 to May 2019. The child parents were informed by the procedure and&#xD;
      signed a consent as well as the study was approved from Ethical Committees and was in&#xD;
      accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki.&#xD;
&#xD;
      inclusion criteria: The study included children aged below 6 years with PCG with or without&#xD;
      antiglaucoma medications and not had previous antiglaucoma surgery with successful&#xD;
      360°trabeculotomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria: Eyes that needs combined operation, previous antiglaucoma procedure and&#xD;
      incomplete trabeculotomy ≤360°.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preoperative examinations: Routine ocular examination or under general anesthesia for younger&#xD;
      children were done after history taking including, age, sex, laterality, family history and&#xD;
      consanguinity, antiglaucoma drugs. The ocular examinations includes IOP with Goldman&#xD;
      applanation or Perkins tonometer, slit lamp, corneal clarity, measurement of horizontal&#xD;
      corneal diameter, axial length by ultrasonography and fundus examination and measurement of&#xD;
      cup disc ratio. The demographic data were registered as in (Table 1).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Surgical procedure:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Under general anesthesia, routine ophthalmology srcupping and sterilization. Eye speculum was&#xD;
      inserted then&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Conjunctival peritomy with fornix based flap was done.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Superficial rectangular scleral flab 3.5 x 4.5 mm and deep scleral flab 2 x 3 mm with&#xD;
           deroofing of Sclemm's canal anteriorly to the scleral spur were done.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cutting Sclemm's canal and exposure of its ostia and dilatation of the ostia by&#xD;
           injection of Healon.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Paracentesis to lower IOP and injection of Miochol for miosis and Healon to keep&#xD;
           anterior chamber stable and deep.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Introducing the illuminated catheter into one of the Sclemm's canal ostium and advanced&#xD;
           through the whole Sclemm's canal 360° circumference.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  When the atraumatic tip of the catheter appeared from the other ostium, both ends were&#xD;
           pulled in opposite direction to make 360° trabeculotomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Both Scleral flaps were closed with interrupted 10/0 nylon suture and Conjunctival flap&#xD;
           with contentious 10/0 nylon suture.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Injection of subconjunctival steroid and antibiotic, then eye dressing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post-operative management :&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients were prescribed topical tobradex( tobramycin- dexamethasone) eye drops QID and&#xD;
      tapering through 4-6 weeks and topical cycloplegic eye drops TID for 3 days. Scheduled follow&#xD;
      up visits were advised next postoperative day, one week, monthly for three months then each&#xD;
      three months till one year. Each visit the child subjected to full ophthalmological&#xD;
      examinations previously mentioned and antiglaucoma medications were prescribed when needed&#xD;
      (IOP&lt;21 mmHg) or appearing of signs of glaucoma progression starting by one drug beta&#xD;
      blockers and adding dorzolamide or prostaglandin to reach the target IOP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients data of 12 months follow-up were recorded. The primary target was mean intraocular&#xD;
      pressure (IOP) study in which unqualified (complete success) was defined as an IOP ≤21 mm Hg&#xD;
      and at least a 30% reduction without the use of antiglaucoma drugs, a qualified success when&#xD;
      medications were used to reach this aim and failure if the target IOP would not reached in&#xD;
      spite of full antiglaucoma medication and the child needs another antiglaucoma procedure. The&#xD;
      secondary target was studding the corneal diameter (CD) and cup disc ratio (C/D) change. The&#xD;
      results of one week, 3 months, 6 months and one year were included in the statistical&#xD;
      analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      statistical analysis: Data were collected, revised, verified, coded, then entered PC for&#xD;
      statistical analysis done by using SPSS statistical package version 20. Descriptive&#xD;
      statistics for quantitative data: mean (X) and standard deviation (SD). Kolmogorov- Smirnov&#xD;
      for normality test was used to differentiate between parametric data and non-parametric data.&#xD;
      Statistical analysis using Wilcoxon signed ranks test for comparison of two related&#xD;
      parameters preoperative and postoperative. For all tests probability (P value) was considered&#xD;
      non-significant if ≥ 0.05, significant if &lt; 0.05, highly significant if &lt; 0.01 and very&#xD;
      highly significant if &lt;0.001.&#xD;
