  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a randomized, prospective, exploratory, descriptive, open label, parallel&#xD;
      group, post-authorization study designed to describe and evaluate two aflibercept treatment&#xD;
      regimens aimed at achieving and maintaining a maximum visual function benefit (i.e., BCVA&#xD;
      stability). The goal of the study is to compare two strategies for dosing regimen with&#xD;
      aflibercept in wet AMD: the standard regimen (one injection every 8 weeks after 3 monthly&#xD;
      loading doses in the treatment of wet age-related macular degeneration) versus the treat and&#xD;
      extend protocol (details outlined below in the &quot;Study Design&quot; section) aiming at achieving&#xD;
      and maintaining maximum visual acuity benefit while minimizing the number of injections.&#xD;
      Patients will be randomized at week 8 (Month 2) in a proportion of 1:2 (Standard treatment :&#xD;
      treat and extend treatment). We aim to demonstrate that the Treat and Extend regimen is&#xD;
      equivalent or better to the standard fixed interval regimen in terms of change in patients'&#xD;
      visual acuity after a year of treatment and that patients in the Treat and Extend arm will&#xD;
      receive fewer injections and fewer visits, than their counterparts in the standard regimen&#xD;
      arm. The results could be used to generate a base for future controlled-randomized clinical&#xD;
      trials on the timing of treatment administration for patients with wAMD.&#xD;

             physician. This includes patients with lesion(s) with less than 50% hemorrhage, less&#xD;
             that 50% fibrosis, and/or serious pigment epithelial detachment (PED)&#xD;
