    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate if two courses of five consecutive sessions of&#xD;
      noninvasive spinal stimulation paired with peripheral nerve stimulation at the forearm&#xD;
      provided by an investigational device (Doublestim™/ MyoRegulator™ System - PathMaker&#xD;
      Neurosystems Inc.) are able to improve wrist stiffness and motor function, when combined with&#xD;
      intensive robotic wrist training program in participants with chronic spastic hemiparesis&#xD;
      after stroke.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Stroke is the fifth leading cause of death and the leading cause of serious long-term&#xD;
      disability in the U.S. Post-stroke impairment often presents as weakness of the upper and&#xD;
      lower limbs and spasticity (muscle and joint stiffness and hyperactivity). This condition&#xD;
      impacts motor recovery and renders the individual dependent for most activities of daily&#xD;
      living. Even with aggressive standard rehabilitation, 65 percent of patients cannot&#xD;
      incorporate their affected hand in functional activities six months after stroke.&#xD;
      Investigators have previously demonstrated that robotic therapy provides significant benefits&#xD;
      to upper limb motor recovery after stroke. The treatment has been acknowledged by the&#xD;
      American Heart Association as an effective form of stroke rehabilitation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Neuromodulation techniques such as noninvasive brain, nerve and spinal direct current&#xD;
      stimulation have been proposed as promising safe tools for augmenting motor learning and&#xD;
      function after brain injury. Ahmed (2014) demonstrated in a pre-clinical mouse model that the&#xD;
      use of combined trans-spinal and peripheral direct current stimulation (tsDCS + pDCS) can&#xD;
      modulate muscle tone and potentially improve motor function. Preliminary clinical trial of&#xD;
      safety and feasibility (Paget-blanc et al. 2019) suggests that five sessions of&#xD;
      transcutaneous spinal direct current stimulation paired with transcutaneous peripheral direct&#xD;
      current stimulation (Doublestim™/ MyoRegulator™ System - PathMaker Neurosystems Inc.)&#xD;
      temporarily reduce spasticity features such as catch response to slow and fast joint stretch&#xD;
      and overall stiffness of the affected extremity with optimal reductions in spasticity&#xD;
      occurring 2-3 weeks post stimulation intervention. Unexpectedly, participants also&#xD;
      experienced significant improvements in motor function, suggestive that tsDCS+ pDCS may&#xD;
      provide a therapeutic window to further augment motor outcomes with robotic wrist training.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators propose a study to evaluate whether two doses of five consecutive days of&#xD;
      paired spinal and peripheral noninvasive stimulation combined with six weeks of intensive&#xD;
      (three times a week) robotic therapy will significantly alter the clinical and objective&#xD;
      measures of spasticity and motor function of the wrist in participants with upper extremity&#xD;
      spasticity after stroke.&#xD;
