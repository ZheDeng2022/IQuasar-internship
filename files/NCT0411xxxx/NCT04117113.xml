    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to collect information from study participants who are&#xD;
      hospitalized with an invasive disease caused by Extraintestinal pathogenic E. coli (ExPEC).&#xD;
      This information will be used to support the development of a new vaccine to prevent&#xD;
      Extraintestinal pathogenic Escherichia coli (ExPEC). E. coli bacteria are a leading cause of&#xD;
      serious infections. Especially adults older than 60 years have a higher risk of developing&#xD;
      such infections. To date, there is no vaccine available to prevent E. coli infections. To&#xD;
      support the development of a vaccine, more information about E. coli infections is first&#xD;
      needed. This information will be collected in the current study, such as:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Medical information such as medical history, diagnosis, duration of hospitalization&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Treatment and outcome of the Extraintestinal pathogenic Escherichia coli (ExPEC)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Laboratory information&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Janssen Research &amp; Development is developing ExPEC10V, a 10-valent conjugate vaccine&#xD;
      comprising the 10 most predominant O-polysaccharides of ExPEC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Invasive ExPEC Disease (IED) is defined as an acute illness consistent with bacterial&#xD;
      infection that is microbiologically confirmed either by the isolation and identification of&#xD;
      E. coli from blood or other normally sterile body sites, or by the isolation and&#xD;
      identification of E. coli from urine in a patient with signs and symptoms of invasive disease&#xD;
      (presence of systemic inflammatory response syndrome [SIRS], sepsis or septic shock) and no&#xD;
      other identifiable source of infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ExPEC is the most common cause of infection in humans resulting from gram-negative bacteria.&#xD;
      ExPEC comprises a pathogenic group of E. coli strains, possessing the ability to colonize and&#xD;
      infect normally sterile body sites and to cause Invasive ExPEC Disease (IED).&#xD;
&#xD;
      ExPEC causes the vast majority of urinary tract infections (UTIs), is the second most&#xD;
      frequent cause of neonatal bacteremia and meningitis, and is a leading cause of adult IED, in&#xD;
      particular bacteremia and sepsis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although IED affects all age categories, adults aged 60 years or older have an increased risk&#xD;
      of developing IED, including bacteremia and sepsis. The incidence of community-acquired ExPEC&#xD;
      bacteremia increases with age, occurring at a rate of 150/100,000 person-years in the United&#xD;
      States (US) adults aged 65 years and older, and 452/100,000 person-years in adults aged 85&#xD;
      years and older. Similar trends have been observed in Europe. In the US, it is estimated that&#xD;
      up to 40,000 patients die annually due to IED, in particular from E. coli sepsis. Overall&#xD;
      case-fatality rates for ExPEC bacteremia range from 13% to 19% but may be much higher (up to&#xD;
      60%) in the elderly with healthcare-associated infections.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The increase in multidrug resistance (ie, resistance to two or more antibiotic classes) among&#xD;
      ExPEC strains, such as E. coli sequence type 131:O25B, represents a major challenge for&#xD;
      prevention and management of ExPEC infections. Global morbidity, hospitalization and&#xD;
      mortality rates due to ExPEC infections are substantial and increasing due to aging&#xD;
      populations and increasing prevalence of antibiotic resistant ExPEC strains, and associated&#xD;
      with increasing healthcare costs in both Europe and the US.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This hospital-based prospective epidemiological study will assess the O-serotype and&#xD;
      O-genotype distribution in E. coli isolates causing IED overall and by subgroup based on risk&#xD;
      factors. Detailed demographic and clinical data, including information on hospital routes,&#xD;
      from patients with IED will be collected in this study to further characterize the clinical&#xD;
      setting in this patient population. This study will also provide data to compare the clinical&#xD;
      criteria of IED used by the study site with the proposed Phase 3 clinical case definition for&#xD;
      IED in adults aged 60 years or older for future clinical studies in this patient population.&#xD;
      No study drug will be administered in this non interventional study.&#xD;
