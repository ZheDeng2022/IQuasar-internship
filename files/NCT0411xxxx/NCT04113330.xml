      The primary objective of the study is to identify any suspected dengue case in subjects that&#xD;
      received at least one dose of the CYD dengue vaccine who were classified as seronegative or&#xD;
      undetermined at baseline (according to PRNT50 at baseline, or anti-non-structural protein 1&#xD;
      [NS1] test Post-dose 3) in the Colombian study sites of CYD15, CYD13, CYD29, CYD64, CYD65&#xD;
      trials in order to allow appropriate access to care until the completion of 10 years after&#xD;
      the last CYD Dengue Vaccine received by each participant&#xD;

      The planned duration of each participant's participation in the study will vary according to&#xD;
      the date when they received their last CYD Dengue Vaccine. The surveillance will last during&#xD;
      10 year after the last CYD dengue vaccination of included participants&#xD;
