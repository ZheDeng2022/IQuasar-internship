  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is currently recommended to start enteral nutrition early in intensive care unit children&#xD;
      receiving invasive or non-invasive mechanical ventilation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Gastrointestinal intolerance is the main complication related to early enteral feeding in&#xD;
      intensive care unit patients, characterized by gastroparesis with delayed gastric emptying&#xD;
      that may lead to regurgitations, vomiting, pulmonary aspiration, and potentially increased&#xD;
      risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Residual gastric volume (RGV) measurement had been recommended to monitor the tolerance to&#xD;
      enteral nutrition in mechanically ventilated patients receiving early enteral feeding.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nevertheless, several studies have challenged the usefulness of such RGV monitoring, showing&#xD;
      that it led to reduced caloric intake without any benefits in terms of reducing the&#xD;
      occurrence of vomiting and the incidence of VAP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This lack of relationship between RGV monitored using gastric suctioning and the occurrence&#xD;
      of regurgitation, aspiration and pneumonia may reflect the inaccuracy of the aspiration&#xD;
      method used for the measurement of the RGV, as it has been reported in adult patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Gastric ultrasonography is a non-invasive and easy-to-use tool allowing accurate preoperative&#xD;
      assessment of gastric contents, based on both qualitative examination of the gastric antrum&#xD;
      and calculation of gastric content volume. Ultrasound examination of the antrum could&#xD;
      therefore constitute an alternative to gastric suctioning for the monitoring of RGV in&#xD;
      intensive care unit patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This prospective study aims to assess the reliability of the RGV monitoring based on gastric&#xD;
      suctioning compared to ultrasound technique. Secondary endpoint is to assess whether&#xD;
      increased gastric volume, aspirated or calculated by ultrasound, is an independent risk&#xD;
      factor of regurgitation and / or vomiting.&#xD;

    <description>A first gastric ultrasound will be performed in the supine and the right lateral (RLD) decubitus position, allowing a qualitative analysis of the gastric contents (empty, liquid, solid, solid-liquid). The antral area will also be measured in both positions. The volume of gastric fluid content will be calculated according to the following formula: volume (ml) = -7,8 + (0,035 x antral area in RLD (mm²)) + 0,127 x age (month).&#xD;
This examination will be immediately followed by the aspiration of gastric contents through the nasogastric tube used for enteral feeding, into 50-ml syringes, by a nurse blinded to the result of the first ultrasound examination. A second antral ultrasound examination will then be performed, by the same investigator blinded to the volume aspirated.&#xD;
The occurrence of regurgitation and / or vomiting occurring within the 12 hours before and after the examination will be recorded.</description>
