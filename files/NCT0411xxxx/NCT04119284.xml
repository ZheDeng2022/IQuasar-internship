  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objectives of this study is to assess whether the intervention (Anterior Vertebral&#xD;
      Tethering) is a safe and efficacious method of anterior approach surgery for spinal deformity&#xD;
      in pediatric scoliosis.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Scoliosis is a condition where the spine is deformed by a curvature in the coronal plane. It&#xD;
      is generally associated with a twisting (axial plane) deformity as well.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Curves between 10 and 25 degrees are considered mild. Curves between 25- and 50 degrees are&#xD;
      classified as moderate. Curves greater than 50 degrees are termed severe. The current&#xD;
      standard of care for moderate Adolescent Idiopathic Scoliosis(AIS) in patients with remaining&#xD;
      growth is to utilize a thoracolumbosacral orthosis (TLSO brace) to prevent progression of&#xD;
      deformity. The scientific evidence has supported the efficacy of this intervention in&#xD;
      avoiding progression of the Cobb angle to 50 degrees or more.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If treated with a TLSO brace, many idiopathic scoliosis patients would conceivably be&#xD;
      subjected to years of brace wear and the cost and psychological factors inherent therein.&#xD;
      Additional downsides of brace treatment include the potentially negative psychosocial impact&#xD;
      of wearing an external sign of deformity during adolescence, a key period of emotional&#xD;
      development. Prior research has identified negative psychosocial effects related to wearing a&#xD;
      brace in children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recent evidence has suggested that certain curve patterns will likely progress to 50 degrees&#xD;
      or more, despite treatment with a TLSO brace. Sanders, et al. demonstrated a correlation of&#xD;
      Cobb angle (greater than 35 degrees) and skeletal maturity (bone age 4 or less) to the risk&#xD;
      of progression to 50 degrees or more, despite TLSO bracing. The evidence supports that the&#xD;
      current practice of TLSO bracing is not an effective treatment to avoid progression to 50&#xD;
      degrees in these patients. It is on this population (thoracic Cobb angle greater than 35&#xD;
      degrees, bone age of 4 or less) that we intend to test the safety and efficacy of Anterior&#xD;
      Vertebral Body Tethering to avoid curve progression to more than 50 degrees.&#xD;
