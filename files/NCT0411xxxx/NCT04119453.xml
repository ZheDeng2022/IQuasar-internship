Subjects will be treated with oral rivoceranib, 700 mg daily during 28-day cycles. Subjects will be monitored for clinical and/or radiographic evidence of disease progression as assessed by tumor growth or the discovery of additional tumors. Restaging scans will be performed approximately every 8 weeks for the first year and then approximately every 12 weeks and at End of Treatment (EOT), or as clinically indicated. Subjects who discontinue treatment for reasons other than progression will have scans at the EOT visit (unless their previous restaging was performed within 6 weeks) and approximately every 12 weeks thereafter (or with the standard of care restaging frequency for their disease) until initiation of a new therapy.</intervention_model_description>
