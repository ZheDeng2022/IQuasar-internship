  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Spinal operations including lumbar fusions for degenerative disorders are becoming more&#xD;
      prevalent as the population ages. Inadequate or excessive postoperative analgesia can result&#xD;
      in medical comorbidities and prolonged hospital length of stay and patient dissatisfaction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Existing literature has highlighted the preoperative administration of methadone as a&#xD;
      promising adjuvant for post operative pain control. Methadone has the benefit of being&#xD;
      long-acting and has more stable serum concentration and a single preoperative dose may have&#xD;
      significant benefits post operatively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Here the investigators propose a prospective parallel-group, randomized, double-blinded study&#xD;
      to assess post operative analgesic requirements after preoperative administration of either&#xD;
      methadone 15 mg or Oxycodone 10/325. Primary outcome will be total IV and PO narcotic&#xD;
      consumption in the post operative course. Secondary outcomes examined will include time to&#xD;
      mobility, need for specialist pain management consultation, early readmission (within 2&#xD;
      weeks) for inadequate pain control, and complications associated with administration.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Lumbar spinal fusions are becoming increasingly popular and prevalent in the treatment of a&#xD;
      variety of spinal pathologies, but predominantly for degenerative disease which is most&#xD;
      prevalent in the obese and or older population. These operations can result in relatively&#xD;
      high post operative surgical pain and necessitate significant post operative opioid&#xD;
      consumption which can precipitate co-morbid medical conditions such as respiratory depression&#xD;
      and failure, pneumonia, gastrointestinal ileus, deep venous thrombosis, and pulmonary&#xD;
      embolism. Additionally, these medical comorbidities also represent an increased burden on&#xD;
      healthcare expenditure with increased length of hospital stay, inpatient testing and&#xD;
      treatment, and need for additional follow up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators objective is to study the effect of a long term opioid analgesic,&#xD;
      methadone, in a uniform population undergoing a single level minimally invasive lumbar&#xD;
      fusion. The preoperative single dose administration of methadone has already been shown to be&#xD;
      effective in improving post operative pain control in open multi-level spinal fusion patient&#xD;
      populations and has become the standard of care in most surgical centers across the country.&#xD;
      The long half-life of methadone results in improved steady state pharmacokinetics relative to&#xD;
      other traditional opioids and is thought to improve pain control while decreasing&#xD;
      consumption. In addition to Mu opioid receptor agonism, Methadone is thought to also have&#xD;
      adjunctive analgesic and anti-tolerance effects due to CNS excitatory glutamatergic NMDA&#xD;
      receptor antagonism. There are also reports of synergistic effects from serotonin and&#xD;
      norepinephrine reuptake inhibition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators predict that a single preoperative oral methadone administration can result&#xD;
      in improved postoperative analgesia with requirement of less IV and PO traditional narcotics&#xD;
      within the first 2 weeks post operatively and also will not increase co-morbid risks relative&#xD;
      to traditional shorter acting opioid analgesics that are presently given preoperatively.&#xD;
