  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and duration of the skin decolonization&#xD;
      brought by a daily wash using Chlorhexidine Gluconate 2% pad compared to a standard wash with&#xD;
      mild soap in children hospitalized in intensive care unit.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Skin is a major reservoir of pathogenic bacteria and intensive care unit patients are&#xD;
      particularly vulnerable to variations in skin colonization and so to infections. These&#xD;
      bacterial skin colonizations can contaminate other patients, nursing staff or even samples,&#xD;
      but above all they are an endogenous source of infection of material. These bacterial skin&#xD;
      colonizations hold therefore a major place in the responsibility of infections associated&#xD;
      with care and can potentially affect the length of patient hospitalization. 2% Chlorhexidine&#xD;
      Gluconate pads have already demonstrated a real efficacy in the sustainable reduction of&#xD;
      central venous catheter-related bacteremias in adults and in children, probably through a&#xD;
      reduction of cutaneous microbial colonization. However, this hypothesis remains to be&#xD;
      confirmed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients in the pediatric surgical intensive care unit of Necker-Enfants Malades hospital are&#xD;
      minors, hospitalized in critical and continuous surgical surveillance unit, for all surgical&#xD;
      specialties excluding cardiac surgery. The use of central venous catheters concerns&#xD;
      approximately 60% of the hospitalization days identified each year. To control&#xD;
      catheter-related bacteremias, all intensive care unit patients are subjected to a service&#xD;
      protocol since 2015, which defines a mild soap daily wash in patients without central venous&#xD;
      catheter and a wash with Chlorhexidine in patients with central venous catheter. Successive&#xD;
      standardized samples will be carried out on the skin of the children submissive to both types&#xD;
      of washes during their hospitalization in intensive care unit.&#xD;
