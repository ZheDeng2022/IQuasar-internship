  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Depression is one of the most important causes of disability in the world today, with major&#xD;
      personal, social and economic costs. Although some moderately effective drug treatments are&#xD;
      already available, about a third of patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) remain&#xD;
      depressed despite current treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is growing evidence that inflammation - the response of the body's immune system to&#xD;
      physical and social stresses - can cause depressive symptoms in some patients. It is&#xD;
      therefore predicted that anti-inflammatory drugs could have anti-depressant effects and the&#xD;
      research team aims to test this using a new drug, JNJ-54175446, which blocks the activity of&#xD;
      a receptor called P2X7. P2X7 is present on many immune cells and plays a key role in the&#xD;
      release of inflammatory molecules during stress, which may be linked to stress-related&#xD;
      depression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research team will recruit approximately up to 142 participants with MDD to this clinical&#xD;
      trial. Patients will have moderate-severe depressive symptoms despite ongoing treatment with&#xD;
      a conventional anti-depressant drug, and they will have blood test results at screening that&#xD;
      indicate they are likely to have active P2X7 signalling in the brain. Eligible participants&#xD;
      will be randomly allocated to receive either 50mg/day JNJ-54175446 or placebo for 8 weeks.&#xD;
      Participants will be assessed at weeks 2, 5 and 8 using a standard clinical depression scale&#xD;
      and the scores compared between those treated with placebo and those treated with&#xD;
      JNJ-54175446. To understand more about the effects of JNJ-54175446 on the immune system and&#xD;
      the brain, patients will also complete additional blood tests, questionnaires and magnetic&#xD;
      resonance imaging (MRI) brain scans at different visits throughout the trial. The trial will&#xD;
      be carried out across 5 centres in the UK.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This trial will be a multi-centre, phase II, randomised, double blinded, placebo-controlled,&#xD;
      parallel group trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research team estimates that the majority of the participants will be recruited through&#xD;
      the trial website, posters and research databases. In order to better assess the suitability&#xD;
      of the interested participants, interested participants are required to answer pre-screening&#xD;
      questions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Only those who might be suitable to take part will be invited to a screening visit to&#xD;
      continue with the rest of the trial screening procedures. The trial will consist of 3 phases&#xD;
      - a screening phase, treatment phase of 8 weeks and follow up phase. This includes a total of&#xD;
      6 clinic visits and will be spread over about 15 weeks. Each clinic visit will last between&#xD;
      1.5 hours to 5 hours. Participants will have to be fasted overnight (10 hrs) prior to&#xD;
      baseline visit 1 and visit 4 for biomarker blood samples. At these visits, breakfast will be&#xD;
      provided after sample collection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The list below outlines the study schedule and key assessments applicable to a participant&#xD;
      who passes the pre-screening questions:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening phase clinic visit Participants who are interested in taking part will be invited&#xD;
      to attend a screening visit in the clinic which lasts about 4 hours. At this visit the trial&#xD;
      team will discuss the trial further and answer any queries the participants may have. If the&#xD;
      participants agree, they will then provide informed consent prior to any screening tests and&#xD;
      procedures being undertaken. An alcohol breath test and urine drug screen will be carried&#xD;
      out. Urine samples will be taken for urinalysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood samples will be taken for safety assessments including full blood count, clinical&#xD;
      chemistry tests, thyroid function tests, pregnancy and Follicle-stimulating hormone test (if&#xD;
      applicable). Biomarker blood samples will also be taken for genetic analysis of P2X7 receptor&#xD;
      and analysis of C-reactive protein (CRP) for eligibility check, and for other biomarker&#xD;
      assays including genetic analysis. Other screening assessments include a review of the&#xD;
      participant's medical and medication history, review of their depressive disorder and&#xD;
      self-reported stress, and a physical examination. Vital signs will be measured and&#xD;
      participants will have an electrocardiogram (ECG) performed. Participants will also be&#xD;
      introduced to the other trial activities that will have to be carried out in their homes.&#xD;
      This includes collection of saliva samples, the use of activity monitoring device and&#xD;
      completion of daily sleep diary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening phone call Once results from the genetic analysis of the P2X7 receptor and CRP&#xD;
      levels are available (about 1 to 2 weeks after the screening visit), the results will be&#xD;
      returned to the site team who will then inform the participant by phone whether they are&#xD;
      eligible. If eligible, a baseline clinic visit will be arranged.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During this call, eligible participants will be reminded that saliva sample collection packs&#xD;
      will be sent in the post, to collect saliva samples at specific time points and return them&#xD;
      to the research team. Participants will also be sent an activity monitoring watch and sleep&#xD;
      diary; participants should start wearing the watch everyday for at least 7 days prior to&#xD;
      baseline visit and record their sleep.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline/Treatment phase Visit 1 Participants will be asked to fast a minimum of 10 hours and&#xD;
      attend a baseline site visit (Day 1) which would last approximately 5 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At this visit, the participant's diagnosis of major depressive episode will be re-checked to&#xD;
      ensure they are still eligible. Fasting blood samples will be taken for full blood count,&#xD;
      clinical chemistry, biomarkers and baseline drug concentration analysis. After breakfast is&#xD;
      given, an alcohol breath test and urine drug screen will be carried out. Urine samples will&#xD;
      be taken for urinalysis and pregnancy test (if applicable). An ECG will be performed and&#xD;
      vital signs will be assessed. Participants who continue to meet eligibility will be&#xD;
      randomised in 1:1 ratio to receive JNJ-54175446 or placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be asked about any adverse events and concomitant therapies. Various&#xD;
      clinical and participant reported questionnaires will be completed to assess stress,&#xD;
      depression symptoms and suicidal risk. Participants will be asked to complete a range of&#xD;
      online cognition tests, during which heart rate variability measurements will be carried out.&#xD;
      Participants will also have a baseline MRI scan which includes completion of a cognitive task&#xD;
      during the scan. At the end of the visit, participants will receive 1 bottle of allocated&#xD;
      trial drug and will be instructed to take 1 capsule every day within 30 minutes after&#xD;
      breakfast. A medication diary will be provided to aid participants in recording their daily&#xD;
      administration. Data from the activity watch will be downloaded and a new copy of daily sleep&#xD;
      diary will be provided.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 2 and Visit 3 Participants will be required to attend a visit to the site at Day 14 ± 2&#xD;
      (Visit 2) and at Day 32 ± 3 (Visit 3), each visit will last approximately 3 ½ hours.&#xD;
      Participants do not need to be fasted for these visits. On these days, participants should&#xD;
      not take their trial drug at home, they will be asked to take the drug at clinic after their&#xD;
      blood and urine collection. At this visit, blood samples will be taken for full blood count,&#xD;
      clinical chemistry analysis, CRP and drug concentration analysis. A urine drug screen will be&#xD;
      carried out. Urine samples will be taken for urinalysis and pregnancy test (if applicable).&#xD;
      Participants will then be asked to take their drug. An ECG will be performed and vital signs&#xD;
      will be assessed. Participants will be asked about any adverse events and concomitant&#xD;
      therapies. Various clinical questionnaires will be carried out to assess stress, depression&#xD;
      and suicidal risk. Participants will be asked to complete a range of online cognition tests.&#xD;
      Participant's trial drug compliance will be reviewed through review of the medication diary&#xD;
      (visits 2 and 3) and physical counting of returned capsules (visit 3). Data will be&#xD;
      downloaded from the activity monitoring device at each of these visits and a new daily sleep&#xD;
      diary will be provided. At visit 3, participants will receive the 2nd bottle of allocated&#xD;
      trial drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Telephone checks In order to maintain regular contact with the participants, the research&#xD;
      team will contact the participants by telephone 8 to 12 days after visit 2 (phone check #1)&#xD;
      and 8 to 12 days after visit 3 (phone check #2). Participants will be asked if they have had&#xD;
      any adverse events, any changes to concomitant therapies and if they had been able to take&#xD;
      the trial drug according to trial instructions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At phone check #2, participants will also be instructed to collect saliva samples within 7&#xD;
      days before the next visit. The saliva collection packs will be posted to the participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 4 Participants will attend a clinic visit on Day 56 ± 3 (Visit 4) lasting approximately&#xD;
      5 hours. Participants need to come to the site in fasted condition (minimum of 10 hours) and&#xD;
      should not take their trial rug at home, they will be asked to take the drug at clinic after&#xD;
      blood and urine collection and breakfast. This will be the final dose for the participants.&#xD;
      At this visit, fasting blood samples will be taken for full blood count, clinical chemistry&#xD;
      analysis, CRP and biomarkers and drug concentration analysis. A urine drug screen will be&#xD;
      carried out. Urine samples will be taken for urinalysis and pregnancy test (if applicable).&#xD;
      Participant will then be asked to take their drug. An ECG will be performed and vital signs&#xD;
      will be assessed. Targeted physical examination will be carried out. Participants will be&#xD;
      asked about any adverse events and concomitant therapies. Various clinical and participant&#xD;
      reported questionnaires will be completed to assess stress, depression symptoms and suicidal&#xD;
      risk. Participants will be asked to complete a range of online cognition tests, during which&#xD;
      heart rate variability measurements will be carried out. The anti-depressant response will be&#xD;
      assessed using a clinical scale (MADRS). Participants will also have a post-treatment MRI&#xD;
      scan which includes completion of a cognitive task during the scan. Data will be downloaded&#xD;
      from the activity monitoring device and the device collected from the participants. All&#xD;
      unused drug will be collected from the participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow up visit (Visit 5) A follow-up visit will be scheduled between 7 and 14 days after&#xD;
      last dose of administration (visit 4) and will last approximately 1 hour. Blood samples will&#xD;
      be taken for full blood count, clinical chemistry and CRP analysis. Urine samples will be&#xD;
      taken for urinalysis and pregnancy test (if applicable). An ECG will be performed and vital&#xD;
      signs will be assessed. Participants will be asked about any adverse events and concomitant&#xD;
      therapies. Targeted physical examination and medical review of symptoms and systems will be&#xD;
      carried out and body weight measured. Participants will be asked to complete a depression&#xD;
      questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Home-based trial assessments Participants will be requested to wear the activity monitoring&#xD;
      device from 7 days prior to visit 1 (Day -7) up until visit 4, and complete a daily sleep&#xD;
      diary. This activity monitoring device will record the participant's activity and sleep&#xD;
      patterns.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants have to self-administer 1 capsule of trial drug daily, preferably in the morning&#xD;
      and within 30 min after breakfast. The date and time of administration should be recorded in&#xD;
      the medication diary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have to provide 2 sets of 6 saliva samples each during the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data analysis The primary endpoint is the change between baseline score and score at final&#xD;
      dose on visit 4 (week 8) assessed by the MADRS scale. 142 participants will be enrolled. All&#xD;
      data will be analysed and summarised in a clinical trial report.&#xD;
