  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The incidence of Crohn's disease (CD) increased the last few years, especially in children,&#xD;
      with 20% percent of CD patients diagnosed during childhood. The CD is a chronic disease&#xD;
      without curative treatment, medical or surgical, and evolution is longer in children, avoid&#xD;
      iterative digestive resections and their consequences in these patients is a major issue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The beginning of the disease at pediatric age is considered to be a poor prognostic factor&#xD;
      and is considered to be more aggressive than that of adults: more extensive, more active and&#xD;
      requiring more immunosuppressive treatments, with a more frequent dependence on&#xD;
      corticosteroids and a shorter delay between the beginning of symptoms and the first surgery.&#xD;
      After 5 years of evolution, 13 to 50% of patients with early pediatric MC have undergone&#xD;
      intestinal resection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Paris' classification defined 3 phenotypes or behaviors in pediatric Crohn's disease.&#xD;
      Penetrating phenotype (B3) is a heterogeneous group defined by the presence of&#xD;
      intra-abdominal perforation, fistulas or abscesses. The B3 phenotype is a risk factor for&#xD;
      pejorative evolution in CD with a risk increased of surgical resection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the pediatric population, the natural history of patients with penetrating CD is unknown.&#xD;
      Most studies focus on CD beginning at pediatric age but with penetrating complications&#xD;
      occurring in adulthood or pediatric penetrating CD but with relatively short follow-up. The&#xD;
      risk of recurrence of the penetrating disease after a first complication in childhood is&#xD;
      unknown, the factors influencing this risk also. And, there is no consensus either concerning&#xD;
      optimal B3 management in children, and the practices are variable from specialist to&#xD;
      specialist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After describing the pediatric population with penetrating CD, the aim of this study was to&#xD;
      know the incidence of bowel resection for B3 episode. The secondary aims were to describe the&#xD;
      immediate management and long-term evolution of these patients and to identify risk factors&#xD;
      for adverse evolution.&#xD;

      This study is cross-sectional and is carrying out between 1995 and 2017 in two French&#xD;
      tertiary referral centers (Montpellier, Toulouse) and EPIMAD registry which is currently the&#xD;
      largest Inflammatory Bowel Disease cohort in world and cover 9.6% of French population (Nord,&#xD;
      Pas-de-Calais, Somme, and Seine-Maritime department).&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients diagnosed with CD who had underwent a B3 complication (intra-abdominal abscess,&#xD;
      fistula, perforation, peritonitis, or phlegmon) before the age of 18. Patient having isolated&#xD;
      perineal disease, indeterminate colitis or with too much missing data were excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main endpoint: incidence of intestinal resection performed for B3 complication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary endpoints:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  description of the pediatric population with B3 complication with:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  demographic data: sex, family history, phenotype of the disease according to the Paris&#xD;
           classification, age at diagnosis of B3, period of diagnosis of B3 (before or after&#xD;
           2001), time between the diagnosis of CD and the diagnosis of B3, a history of medical&#xD;
           and surgical treatment for CD received before B3.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  clinical data: type of B3 complication, presence of stenosis and its location, clinical&#xD;
           symptoms (fever, obstructive symptoms), nutritional status.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  description of the immediate management of these patients, specifying: the place of&#xD;
           care, the type of immediate management performed, the drug treatments received in the&#xD;
           acute phase, the medical treatments for CD introduced for the B3 episode, the intestinal&#xD;
           resections performed for the B3 episode, the realization of a stoma, the radiological&#xD;
           drainage of abscesses, the immediate complications of B3.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  description of the long-term evolution of these patients, specifying: the given drug&#xD;
           treatments, the clinical recurrence of the CD, the recurrence of B3, the need for&#xD;
           intestinal resection during follow-up, the occurrence of other events&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  identification of risk factors for pejorative evolution defined by &quot;recurrence of B3&quot; or&#xD;
           &quot;intestinal resection&quot; in these patients.&#xD;
