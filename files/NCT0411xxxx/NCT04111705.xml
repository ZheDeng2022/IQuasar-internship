  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Crizotinib is a first-generation ALK tyrosine kinase inhibitor (ITK-ALK). It is the standard&#xD;
      first-line treatment for patients with advanced NSCLC with ALK gene rearrangement. Alectinib,&#xD;
      ceritinib and brigatinib are second-generation ITK-ALK. They have been shown to be effective&#xD;
      in the first line of treatment in randomized trials. Alectinib has shown superiority to&#xD;
      crizotinib as the first line of treatment in three randomized therapeutic trials, positioning&#xD;
      this ITK-ALK as the treatment of choice in first-line treatment. Despite the effectiveness of&#xD;
      these new treatments, all patients will virtually experience a relapse. There is no data on&#xD;
      second-generation TKI-ALK resistance mechanisms when given as first-line treatment and the&#xD;
      best therapeutic strategy for progression is undefined.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Signed Written Informed Consent:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Subjects must have signed and dated an IRB/IEC approved written informed consent&#xD;
                  form in accordance with regulatory and institutional guidelines. This must be&#xD;
                  obtained before the performance of any protocol related procedures that are not&#xD;
                  part of normal subject care.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Subjects must be willing and able to comply with scheduled visits, treatment&#xD;
                  schedule, and laboratory testing&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Patients with histologically or cytologically confirmed locally advanced not eligible&#xD;
             to a local treatment or metastatic NSCLC (Stage IIIB or IV accordingly to 8th&#xD;
             classification TNM, UICC 2015) that carries an ALK rearrangement, as determined by the&#xD;
             molecular biology platform of the investigator by FISH assay or by&#xD;
             Immunohistochemistry (IHC), or Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) or RNA sequencing&#xD;
             approach .&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Disease Status Requirements: Disease progression meeting RECISTv1.1 after first-line&#xD;
             alectinib or brigatinib only. No prior chemotherapy is allowed in the metastatic&#xD;
             disease setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Tumor Requirements: All Patients must have at least one measurable target lesion&#xD;
             according to RECIST v1.1. In addition, patients with asymptomatic and neurologically&#xD;
             stable CNS metastases (including patients controlled with stable or decreasing steroid&#xD;
             use within the last week prior to study entry) will be eligible. The brain metastases&#xD;
             may be newly diagnosed after disease progression with alectinib or brigatinib or be&#xD;
             present as progressive disease after surgery, whole brain radiotherapy or stereotactic&#xD;
             radiosurgery (see Exclusion Criterion for the lapsed time period required between the&#xD;
             end of radiotherapy and study entry). Patients who have leptomeningeal disease (LM) or&#xD;
             carcinomatous meningitis (CM) will be eligible if the LM/CM is visualized on MRI or if&#xD;
             documented baseline cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) positive cytology is available and&#xD;
             asymptomatic and neurologically stable (including patients controlled with stable or&#xD;
             decreasing steroid use within the last week prior to study entry).&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Tumor Sample Requirement: Tumour biopsy sampling on fresh tissue (FFPE blocks&#xD;
             required) at time of progression on first-line TKI is mandatory. Tumour biopsy should&#xD;
             be exploitable for molecular analysis. If the tumour biopsy is not exploitable, the&#xD;
             inclusion will be allowed if two blood samples are provided for tumoral cfDNA&#xD;
             analysis. The Sponsor will monitor a posteriori the exploitability of provided tumour&#xD;
             biopsies and will investigate the impossibility to perform or repeat tissue tumor&#xD;
             sampling.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Age ≥18 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Life expectancy of at least 12 weeks, in the opinion of the Investigator.&#xD;

             within the screening period. A patient is of childbearing potential if, in the opinion&#xD;
             of the investigator, she is biologically capable of having children and is sexually&#xD;
             active. Additionally, all females of childbearing potential must provide an agreement&#xD;
             to remain abstinent or use two adequate methods of contraception, including at least&#xD;
             one method with a failure rate of &lt; 1% per year, during the treatment period and for&#xD;

             study drug and agreement to refrain from donating sperm during this same period.&#xD;
&#xD;
         17. Evidence of a personally signed and dated informed consent document indicating that&#xD;
             the patient has been informed of all pertinent aspects of the study.&#xD;

&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;

          6. Major surgery within 35 days of study entry. Minor surgical procedures (eg, port&#xD;
             insertion, mediastinoscopy, surgical procedure for re-sampling) are not excluded, but&#xD;
             sufficient time at investigator discretion should have passed for wound healing.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Radiation therapy within 2 weeks of study entry (except palliative to relieve bone&#xD;
