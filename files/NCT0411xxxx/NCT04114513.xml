  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The randomized double-blinded placebo-controlled multicenter study will be held in parallel&#xD;
      groups. During 5 weeks the efficacy of different endpoints as a measure of response to the&#xD;
      daily intake of dietary fibers (8 g of either inulin, pectin, beta-glucan or&#xD;
      galactooligosaccharides) will be evaluated. Gut microbiota composition, lipids levels,&#xD;
      inflammation markers, microbiome metabolites, changes in quality of life and stool parameters&#xD;
      will be assessed in order to predict individual response in participants without serious&#xD;
      chronic diseases&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A randomized double-blinded study will include 270 volunteers without clinical manifestations&#xD;
      of chronic diseases. Participants will be randomized into one of five arms daily consuming&#xD;
      one of the following: placebo (maltodextrin, 8 g), inulin (8 g), pectin (8 g), beta-glucan (8&#xD;
      g) or oligosaccharides (8 g).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will include a 5-day screening period and a 5-weeks intervention period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During screening stage, a volunteer will complete a questionnaire, and the following&#xD;
      measurements will be performed: blood levels of glycated hemoglobin, creatinine, lipids,&#xD;
      C-reactive protein, anthropometric measurements, as well as cardiovascular risk will be&#xD;
      assessed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before and after the intervention blood and stool samples will be collected to conduct the&#xD;
      following analyses: an extended lipid spectrum analysis, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein,&#xD;
      16S rRNA gut microbiome sequencing, laboratory stool testing, stool fecal short-chain fatty&#xD;
      acids analysis. Anthropometric measures, physical examination will be performed for each&#xD;
      volunteer. The following questionnaires will be completed: dietary recall questionnaire,&#xD;
      SF-36, the Rome Criteria for the Functional gastrointestinal disorders (functional&#xD;
      constipation). The assessed scales will include Bristol stool scale, Hospital Anxiety and&#xD;
      Depression Scale (HADS), Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HRSD).&#xD;

In addition to scores for individual dimensions, two summary scores assessing physical and mental dimensions of health and well-being can also be calculated: Physical Component Summary (PCS) score and the Mental Component Summary (MCS) score, respectively</description>

    <description>Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) Patients anxiety and depression will be assessed using the HADS : Hospital Anxiety and Depression scale.&#xD;
Scores of the HADS scale can be defined as:&#xD;
By adding the points of the answers: 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13: we obtain the &quot;Total A&quot; which corresponds to the measure of the anxiety, then:&#xD;
7 or less: absence of symptomatology; 8 to 10: doubtful symptomatology; 11 and above: certain symptomatology.&#xD;
By adding the points of the answers: 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14: we obtain the &quot;Total B&quot; which corresponds to the measure of the depression, then:&#xD;
7 or less: absence of symptomatology; 8 to 10: doubtful symptomatology; 11 and above: certain symptomatology. The minimal score is 0 and the maximal total score is 42.</description>
