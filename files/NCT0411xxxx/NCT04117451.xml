  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The oral microbiome has recently emerged as a key contributor in nitric oxide (NO)&#xD;
      homeostasis and vascular control by increasing nitrite bioavailability. Antibacterial&#xD;
      mouthwash containing chlorhexidine has been shown to be effective in inhibiting the&#xD;
      nitrate-reducing activity of oral bacteria, and increasing blood pressure in normotensive and&#xD;
      hypertensive individuals. Recent research has also shown that chlorhexidine mouthwash lowered&#xD;
      salivary pH and increased salivary lactate and glucose. This was also associated with changes&#xD;
      on the activity and diversity of oral bacteria that are susceptible to increase the risk of&#xD;
      periodontal disease. On the other hand, mouthwash containing propolis has similar&#xD;
      antimicrobial effects than chlorhexidine, but adding some positive outcomes such as increased&#xD;
      salivary antioxidant capacity. This may suggest that propolis mouthwash modulates the&#xD;
      activity/diversity of oral bacteria. Thus, this study aims to investigate the effect of&#xD;
      propolis mouthwash on the nitrate-reducing activity of oral bacteria and vascular function&#xD;
      compared to chlorhexidine in healthy humans.&#xD;

      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants: Adult healthy and non-smoker individuals will be recruited. The study will be&#xD;
      approved by the Human Ethics Committee of the University of Plymouth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main protocol: Participants will visit the laboratory on two different occasions. At the&#xD;
      first visit, basic anthropometrical measurements will be taken before to collect a blood (6&#xD;
      mL) and saliva (3 mL) samples under fasting conditions. Then, the nitrate reducing capacity&#xD;
      of oral bacteria will be measured using a 10 mL of a free-nitrite water solution containing&#xD;
      sodium nitrate. Participants will rinse their mouth for 5 min. Then, the mouth rinse will be&#xD;
      collected into a sterile tube to analyse the absolute concentration of nitrite. Following&#xD;
      this, blood pressure will be taken in triplicate on the left arm using an electronic&#xD;
      sphygmomanometer. Then, microvascular function will be measured on the left forearm (extensor&#xD;
      digitorum) using a hyperaemia reactive test. At the end of this visit and following a&#xD;
      double-blind and non-cross over design participants will be allocated in one group: 1)&#xD;
      chlorhexidine mouthwash or 2) propolis mouthwash. Participants will be given 14 tubes of 10&#xD;
      mL of mouthwash to rinse their mouth twice a day for a week before to return to the&#xD;
      laboratory a week later and to undertake the same measurements.&#xD;
