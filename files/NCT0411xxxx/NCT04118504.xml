  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Ischemic heart disease is the most frequent cause of mortality in the surrounding countries.&#xD;
      Once a coronary event is over, there is a high risk of readmission, recurrence and,&#xD;
      mortality, attributed to a sub-optimal control of cardiovascular risk factors (CVRF),&#xD;
      highlighting the need to improve secondary prevention strategies aimed at changing lifestyle&#xD;
      and therapeutic adherence. Preventive measures should be initiated during hospitalization as&#xD;
      recommended by the clinical guidelines. The objective of this study is to evaluate, through a&#xD;
      randomized controlled clinical trial, the effect of an intervention based on a web&#xD;
      application of health (e-Health) on lifestyle (diet, physical activity and tobacco&#xD;
      consumption) and medication adherence in people with coronary heart disease after&#xD;
      percutaneous coronary intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sample will consist of 240 participants, 120 in the intervention group and 120 in the&#xD;
      usual care group that will be evaluated at the beginning and nine months after hospital&#xD;
      discharge regarding sociodemographic, clinical, CVRF, lifestyle and therapeutic adherence&#xD;
      characteristics. The educational intervention, monitoring and self-monitoring will be carried&#xD;
      out using a web-based e-Health tool, mobile phone application. The quantitative primary&#xD;
      results will be compared between the two groups using ANCOVA adjusting for age and sex.&#xD;
      Multivariate analysis will be carried out to examine the association of the intervention with&#xD;
      life habits, control of CVRF, as well as with the evolution after discharge in respect of&#xD;
      cardiovascular events, emergency and re-entry views.&#xD;

      Design&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. A randomized single-blind, parallel-group, controlled clinical trial performed on&#xD;
           patients with coronary heart disease who underwent a percutaneous coronary intervention&#xD;
           (PCI) with stent placement in the Cardiology Service of a public reference hospital&#xD;
           complex providing specialist care in the province of Cadiz, Spain, in which 1500&#xD;
           coronary interventions procedures are performed per year.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Randomization and Blinding The randomization and allocation to each group (1:1,&#xD;
           intervention and usual care) are based on computer-generated random numbers. The&#xD;
           researchers responsible for the study do not participate in the allocation of the&#xD;
           participants. Due to the kind of intervention, blinding is not possible when the&#xD;
           participants are allocated to groups. To minimize any bias, objective clinical variables&#xD;
           are measured in the evaluation visit and the analyses are performed by blinded&#xD;
           researchers.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Study Sample The participants are eligible to participate if they have a confirmed&#xD;
           diagnosis of coronary heart disease and undergo stenting with PCI. Furthermore, the&#xD;
           participants must comply with the criteria explained in the section.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Sample Size To detect a medium effect size of Cohen's d of 0.5 regarding adherence to&#xD;
           the Mediterranean diet (8.6 ± 2.0 puntos), food consumption, vegetables (471.4 g/day ±&#xD;
           230.0 g/day), fruit (308.4 g/day ± 188.6 g/day), meat and derived products (149.7 g/day&#xD;
           ± 63.7 g/day), fish (122.3 g/day ± 73.5 g/day), physical activity (210.2 METs-min/day&#xD;
           -metabolic equivalents- ±221.8 METs-min/day) and a 12% decrease in smoking habits&#xD;
           (prevalence of 21% in pilot study), a 95% confidence interval and a power of 90%, the&#xD;
           sample size is estimated at 100 patients in each group. Assuming a 20% loss to follow-up&#xD;
           with 240 participants, 120 in each arm: intervention and usual care.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Recruitment After the PCI and during admission, the nurse will recruit eligible patients&#xD;
           and their care partners, will ask them to sign the informed consent, perform the initial&#xD;
           assessment and organize a programmed visit after 36 weeks. A card will be provided with&#xD;
           the date of the appointment and a telephone number for any changes.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The participants allocated to the usual care group receive the standard prescribed care&#xD;
           and advice about medication, and lifestyle.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Both groups will be provided with written recommendations and an explanation about the&#xD;
           standard Mediterranean diet, physical activity, stopping smoking and treatment&#xD;
           adherence.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Before hospital discharge, all the patients will be encouraged to follow a healthy&#xD;
           lifestyle. Stages of change strategies will be used in addition to a motivational and&#xD;
           behavior changing interview. Written information will be provided about risk factors,&#xD;
           lifestyle goals, a suggested healthy menu, recommendations about the daily intake of&#xD;
           food groups, and the other behavior that the intervention is targeting.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Intervention The intervention begins during the patient's stay in hospital immediately&#xD;
           after a coronary event. The participants from the intervention group and their&#xD;
           partner/carer will complete a short online tutorial describing the mobile application&#xD;
           accessed using a mobile telephone or tablet. They will be advised to use the application&#xD;
           for at least 15 min per day. This time has been considered sufficient for the daily&#xD;
           recording of data in the pilot study. The intervention will last 36 weeks. If the&#xD;
           patient does not record data for a week, he/she receives a message through the app&#xD;
           encouraging him to use it. The patients may resolve any queries using the application's&#xD;
           built-in messaging function, to which the nurse will reply through this messaging&#xD;
           service or with a telephone call. This avoids many patient visits to the doctor for&#xD;
           consultations and reduces human resource needs.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Before the trial, a pilot study was performed with 20 participants to test the&#xD;
           application and make any necessary adjustments.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Technical Data of the Website and Application The responsive online application (user&#xD;
           registration, data management, downloading records) is managed via the project website,&#xD;
           which acts as an access platform after validation with a password. The web environment&#xD;
           enables the application to be executed using any browser. Operating environment: it is&#xD;
           an application with remote access to a MySQL (My Structured Query Language) database.&#xD;
           Technology development: (a) uses PHP scripting language (Personal Home Page Tools); (b)&#xD;
           Asynchronous JavaScript and XML (AJAX) web development techniques . The application runs&#xD;
           in the user's browser while it communicates with the server in the background; and (c)&#xD;
           Bootstrap open-source tools for designing websites and online applications. Data&#xD;
           storage: MySQL database is fast enough to deploy web applications. Data protection: in&#xD;
           addition to on-demand backups performed by the software, the web server performs daily&#xD;
           backups of all the files, so the data and program are doubly protected. Access privacy:&#xD;
           The data are not stored in a local computer but on a web server, meaning they can only&#xD;
           be accessed with a password. This web server works with anonymous data and is located in&#xD;
           the country to comply with the regulations for the protection of high-level data.&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. Application Contents The application allows users to set goals and monitor their food&#xD;
           consumption, physical exercise, blood pressure, tobacco use, and compliance with their&#xD;
           treatment. It is based on the phases of change theory (attention, retention, memory,&#xD;
           action, and motivation) and on making the process pleasing. The user's attention is&#xD;
           caught through warnings and bright, attractive colors on the user interface; retention&#xD;
           is encouraged by reminders, repetition and graphs; action is prompted by instructions,&#xD;
           advice, and feedback; and motivation to change is boosted by internal comparisons&#xD;
           (progress graphs), setting goals, self-monitoring and feedback.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Through its different components (website, messages, emails, and calls), participants&#xD;
           are encouraged to (1) follow a healthy eating pattern based on the Mediterranean diet&#xD;
           aligned with national dietary guidelines; (2) perform physical activity of duration and&#xD;
           intensity in line with the recommendations of their cardiologist; (3) stop smoking; (4)&#xD;
           monitor their blood pressure; (5) adhere to their treatment by associating taking&#xD;
           medication with daily activities, establishing set times for taking it and with support&#xD;
           from a relative, etc.&#xD;
&#xD;
        9. Components of the Application A. Provide information encouraging a healthy lifestyle.&#xD;
           Through the website the participants will have access to information on their screens&#xD;
           that they can print to help them plan a healthier lifestyle and adhere to their&#xD;
           treatment. The application also has a training section for the patient with information&#xD;
           about the recommended therapeutic objectives in the clinical practice guidelines&#xD;
           regarding food, physical activity, body weight, blood pressure, blood sugar, stopping&#xD;
           smoking and adhering to treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
           B. Self-monitoring. The application has a recording and self-checking function to help&#xD;
           patients to self-monitor the skills for each behavioral goal about nutrition, physical&#xD;
           activity, tobacco consumption, blood pressure, body weight, capillary blood glucose in&#xD;
           patients with diabetes mellitus and treatment adherence.&#xD;
&#xD;
       10. Training Session about the Application for Patient and Carer The nurse will install the&#xD;
           shortcut to the application on the screen of the participant's mobile phone and will&#xD;
           record the prescribed treatment including the name, dose, and timetable in the&#xD;
           application. The nurse will update the prescription in the application if the doctor&#xD;
           changes the treatment. During the training session, the participants learn to use the&#xD;
           functions of the application: confirm when medication is taken, record the food consumed&#xD;
           and physical activity performed (daily), blood pressure, weight, and tobacco consumption&#xD;
           (weekly), and capillary blood glucose in participants with diabetes mellitus (twice a&#xD;
           week).&#xD;
&#xD;
           The participants can follow their evolution and progress through the graphics generated&#xD;
           with the information they have recorded over the previous eight weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
       11. Ethical Considerations The study will be conducted in agreement with the guidelines and&#xD;
           protocols established in the Helsinki Declaration as revised in Fortaleza (Brazil) in&#xD;
           October 2013, and complies with Law 14/2007 on Biomedical Research and with European&#xD;
           Data Protection Regulations. It was approved by the Biomedical Research Ethics Committee&#xD;
           of the Costa del Sol, Andalusian, with the reference: 003_ene19_PI-EVITE-18. The&#xD;
           informed written consent of all the patients will be requested. The application&#xD;
           guarantees the security measures regarding the current General Data Protection&#xD;
           Regulations in Europe. It also includes data encryption mechanisms.&#xD;
