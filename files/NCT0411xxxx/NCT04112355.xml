    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research is to understand the normal healthy response to immunological&#xD;
      challenge by measuring circulating cytokine and chemokine levels before and after&#xD;
      vaccinations in healthy children. These data will define a range of normal responses that can&#xD;
      be used to help us understand pathogenic mechanisms in children who do not respond normally&#xD;
      to infections. In addition, this study will test the hypothesis that genetic polymorphisms in&#xD;
      the interleukin-1 receptor antagonist gene are associated with differential inflammatory&#xD;
      responses across the healthy spectrum.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Children who experience seizures that cannot be stopped by traditional anti-seizure&#xD;
      medications often suffer profound brain injury and intellectual disability. Indeed, many of&#xD;
      these children do not survive. In one study, 12% of children who developed an acute onset&#xD;
      disease called FIRES (febrile infection-related epilepsy syndrome) died during the early&#xD;
      stages of the disease, and of the children who survived, more than 90% developed cognitive&#xD;
      impairment and lifelong epilepsy that could not be treated by our standard drugs. The&#xD;
      discovery of new therapeutic strategies is therefore imperative.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A role for inflammation and the innate and adaptive immune systems in generating seizures is&#xD;
      a burgeoning but understudied field in epilepsy research. While data from multiple human and&#xD;
      animal studies suggests that inflammatory cytokines can drive ictogenesis, the development of&#xD;
      strategies to modulate inflammation are hindered by insufficient knowledge regarding the&#xD;
      dynamic range of healthy responses to infection and immunological challenge. On this basis,&#xD;
      the investigators intend to measure changes in levels of inflammatory cytokines and&#xD;
      chemokines in the blood induced by the normal healthy response to vaccination. To do so, the&#xD;
      investigators will collect a small amount of blood from children just before they receive&#xD;
      their standard vaccinations at 6 months, 12 months, or 4-6 years of age. A follow-up sample&#xD;
      will then be collected from the same children approximately 10-14 days later. Since it is&#xD;
      known that about 30% of children develop a fever within this timeframe, it is expected that&#xD;
      the size of the change in inflammatory factors in each child will reflect a Gaussian&#xD;
      distribution, with &quot;high responders&quot; and &quot;low responders&quot; centered on a mean response. For&#xD;
      each sample the investigators will isolate serum and measure the levels of interleukin-1&#xD;
      beta, interleukin-6, tumor necrosis factor alpha, chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 2, chemokine&#xD;
      (C-C motif) ligand 5, chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand 1, chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand 2,&#xD;
      chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand 8, chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand 9, and chemokine (C-X-C&#xD;
      motif) ligand 10.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, based on recent findings showing that some children with acute seizure disorders&#xD;
      exhibit previously unknown genetic polymorphisms in the interleukin-1 receptor antagonist&#xD;
      (IL1RA) gene that are associated with altered immunological function, the investigators have&#xD;
      hypothesized that normal healthy children will exhibit a spectrum of IL1RA function that will&#xD;
      correlate with the size of their response to vaccination. To test this hypothesis the&#xD;
      investigators will collect genomic DNA for sequencing of the IL1RA gene (also known as IL1RN)&#xD;
      and will measure the function of the IL1RA protein in serum. This genetic and functional data&#xD;
      will be correlated with the inflammatory cytokine and chemokine response measured in serum.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several key findings will be made in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Measure the normal range of inflammatory responses that occur in the blood when a person&#xD;
           is given a vaccine; blood will be collected just before the vaccination and then again&#xD;
           1-2 weeks later.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Measure protein function in the blood and build up a graph showing the range of such&#xD;
           function in healthy kids.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Sequence the gene that produces a specific protein in healthy children. All humans have&#xD;
           minor changes in genes that subtly alter the function of proteins. These are called&#xD;
           polymorphisms and they are completely normal. The investigators want to build up a&#xD;
           picture of the type of polymorphisms that occur in children and then compare these&#xD;
           differences. This information might help to someday develop new ways to help children&#xD;
           with dysfunctional proteins.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is in no way based on the idea that vaccines &quot;are bad&quot;. This study was designed&#xD;
      because children all respond a little differently to vaccines (for example, some get sore at&#xD;
      the injection site, some get a low fever, some feel more tired than usual) and this indicates&#xD;
      that the body is responding to the immunization in ways that can be measured. The&#xD;
      investigators think that the normal healthy response to vaccination will help define a range&#xD;
      of responses that can be used to help other children who do not respond normally to&#xD;
      infections. While this study is focused on a specific protein and on helping children who&#xD;
      have defects in this factor, these findings will be widely relevant to understanding many&#xD;
      diseases of the immune system in children.&#xD;
