  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Type D personality is characterized by negative affectivity and social inhibition and is&#xD;
      assessed with the DS-14 questionnaire. This type of personality was initially described in&#xD;
      patients with coronary heart disease and associated with poor prognosis and diminished&#xD;
      quality of life. Whereas the prevalence of type D personality in patients with coronary heart&#xD;
      disease is between 27% and 31%, the prevalence in the general population is between 13% and&#xD;
      24%. The prevalence of type D personality in OSA (Obstructive Sleep Apnea Syndrome) was only&#xD;
      investigated in patients with a moderate or severe OSA (Apnea-hypopnea index &gt; 15/hour)&#xD;
      already on standard clinical treatment with CPAP (Continuous Positive Airway Pressure). The&#xD;
      overall prevalence of type D personality in OSA is still unknown. Furthermore, OSA is&#xD;
      frequently associated with cardiovascular disease. No studies were performed on the impact of&#xD;
      type D personality and cardiovascular complications in OSA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Until now, only a few studies were performed to investigate type D personality in OSA&#xD;
      patients treated with CPAP therapy. One retrospective study showed that OSA patients with&#xD;
      type D personality experienced more side effects of CPAP treatment and were less compliant to&#xD;
      therapy. In a more recent prospective study, the influence of type D personality on CPAP&#xD;
      compliance could not be confirmed. No information is available about the frequency of visits&#xD;
      and the time spent by these patients to remediate CPAP side effects. There is also no data&#xD;
      about the discontinuation rate of CPAP treatment in this population of patients. It is&#xD;
      possible that a specific follow up of those patients is needed to enhance CPAP compliance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After a while, CPAP therapy can have an influence on mood and behavior. Therefore, it is&#xD;
      possible that CPAP therapy can alter the patient's answers to the DS-14 questionnaire. This&#xD;
      could explain the different outcome of the retrospective and prospective studies mentioned&#xD;
      above. No studies were performed to test the reliability and validate the DS-14 questionnaire&#xD;
      in OSA patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Consequently, the aim of the present study is to evaluate more extensively the importance of&#xD;
      type D personality traits in OSA patients.&#xD;

      Objective of the study&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To determine the overall prevalence of type D personality in untreated OSA ( Obstructive&#xD;
           sleep apnea) patients and their subtypes; mild, moderate, severe and REM (rapid eye&#xD;
           movement) OSA.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Full polysomnography and questionnaires:ESS, PSQI, DS-14, SF-36, ISI, FAS, HADS, BFI-2,&#xD;
           CIS will be used to answer this question.&#xD;
&#xD;
           A multistage tracking for gender and type D personality was done. In general population,&#xD;
           there are twice as much men than women suffering from OSA. This means that the&#xD;
           investigator need to recruit 41% (√ 2 ≈ 1.41%) more men than women. In the general&#xD;
           population, the prevalence of type D personality is 25%.&#xD;
&#xD;
           To answer this question, the investigator also assume that there will be 50 % mild, 25%&#xD;
           moderate and 25% severe OSA.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Chi- squared test:&#xD;
&#xD;
           With a power of 0.9: 97 type D patients are needed with a total of 400 patients to be&#xD;
           recruited.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To establish the reliability and validity of the DS-14 questionnaire to diagnose type D&#xD;
           personality in OSA patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Full polysomnography and questionnaires:ESS, PSQI, DS-14, SF-36, ISI, FAS, HADS, BFI-2,&#xD;
           CIS will be used. the DS-14 questionnaire will be filled out one month later.&#xD;
&#xD;
           An interclass correlation analysis with kappa ≈ 0.8 will give a good correlation between&#xD;
           the two scores. First, a pilot study will be done on a small sample of patients. In&#xD;
           function of these results, a sample calculation required to have a significant result&#xD;
           will be done. In an earlier study, 135 patients with type D personality were studied to&#xD;
           assess the reproducibility of the DS-14 questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To investigate the impact of type D personality on CPAP ( continuous positive airway&#xD;
           pressure) treatment in OSA patients, especially on compliance for CPAP, on the CPAP&#xD;
           discontinuation rate and on the frequency and time spent to remediate side effects of&#xD;
           CPAP treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Full polysomnography and questionnaires:ESS, PSQI, DS-14, SF-36, ISI, FAS, HADS, BFI-2,&#xD;
           CIS will be used. The DS-14 questionnaire will be filled out one month later.Titration&#xD;
           polysomnography 2 months later and questionnaires: ESS, PSQI, DS-14, SF-36, ISI, FAS,&#xD;
           HADS, CIS.Consultation 3 month later for control compliance and questionnaires: DS-14,&#xD;
           SF-36, HADS, FAS, CIS, EES, PSQI.Polyclinic visit 1 year later for control compliance&#xD;
           and questionnaires: DS-14, SF-36, HADS, FAS, CIS, EES, PSQI.Monitoring time and&#xD;
           frequency of free consultation for resolving any side effects of the CPAP treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Additionally, the investigator assume that there is a 25% chance (midrange) to&#xD;
           discontinue CPAP treatment and 70% (midrange) compliance. Compliance will be normalized&#xD;
           to a percentage scale by dividing by the expected hours of sleep (for the power&#xD;
           analysis, we take 7 hours expected sleep). A hypothetical difference of 1 hour will&#xD;
           therefore represent 14.29% (=1/7).&#xD;
&#xD;
           For the t-tests:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Standard deviation: based on a 95% interval for CPAP [4h-9h], the investigator divide&#xD;
           this interval of 5 h by 4 (4 sigma's for 95%). Followed by a normalization (1/7), one&#xD;
           sigma gives 17.86%. With a power of 0.9 and α= 0.01 (Bonferonni correction), 128&#xD;
           patients will be needed for an unbalanced design of both groups in a ratio of 75% versus&#xD;
           25%.&#xD;
&#xD;
           For the Fisher Exact- test:&#xD;
&#xD;
           General OSA population Expected in type D Good compliance 70% (between 60 &amp; 80%) 56% (&#xD;
           70% minus 14%) Poor compliance 30% 44%&#xD;
&#xD;
           With a power of 0.9: in total 580 patients are needed. (580 patients of which 25% type&#xD;
           D: Feasible since about 500 new OSA patients are diagnosed and treated a year at the UZ&#xD;
           Brussels)&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To determine the influence of type D personality on cardiovascular complications in OSA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline polysomnography: two groups: OSA with type D and without type D and questionnaires:&#xD;
      ESS, PSQI, DS-14, SF-36, ISI, FAS, HADS, BFI-2, CIS. Search medical files for cardiovascular&#xD;
      morbidity in both groups Additionally, the investigator assume that there is a 25% chance&#xD;
      (midrange) to discontinue CPAP treatment and 70% (midrange) compliance. Compliance will be&#xD;
      normalized to a percentage scale by dividing by the expected hours of sleep (for the power&#xD;
      analysis, we take 7 hours expected sleep). A hypothetical difference of 1 hour will therefore&#xD;
      represent 14.29% (=1/7).&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the t-tests:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Standard deviation: based on a 95% interval for CPAP [4h-9h], the investigator divide this&#xD;
      interval of 5 h by 4 (4 sigma's for 95%). Followed by a normalization (1/7), one sigma gives&#xD;
      17.86%. With a power of 0.9 and α= 0.01 (Bonferonni correction), 128 patients will be needed&#xD;
      for an unbalanced design of both groups in a ratio of 75% versus 25%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the Fisher Exact- test:&#xD;
&#xD;
      General OSA population Expected in type D Good compliance 70% (between 60 &amp; 80%) 56% ( 70%&#xD;
      minus 14%) Poor compliance 30% 44%&#xD;
&#xD;
      With a power of 0.9: in total 580 patients are needed. (580 patients of which 25% type D:&#xD;
      Feasible since about 500 new OSA patients are diagnosed and treated a year at the UZ&#xD;
      Brussels)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedures To determine the overall prevalence of type D personality in untreated OSA&#xD;
      patients and their subtypes, all patients admitted to the sleep laboratory for a&#xD;
      polysomnography will be asked to participate to this study. An informed consent will be&#xD;
      signed and patients will complete a number of questionnaires. In the current practice of the&#xD;
      sleep laboratory, the Epworth sleepiness scale, the Stanford sleepiness scale, the Pittsburgh&#xD;
      sleep quality index, the Insomnia severity scale, the DS-14 questionnaire, the SF-36&#xD;
      questionnaire, the FAS, HADS, BFI-2 and CIS are filled out by each patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients who test positive for OSA (AHI &gt; 5/hour) and positive for type D personality&#xD;
      (DS-14: SI&gt;10 and NA&gt;10) will be asked to complete these questionnaires once more 1 month&#xD;
      later. This is necessary to evaluate the test-retest reliability/stability of the DS-14&#xD;
      questionnaire in OSA. To evaluate the validity of this questionnaire in OSA, correlation&#xD;
      patterns with the BFI-2 and the HADS will be investigated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For all patients diagnosed with moderate OSA in which treatment with CPAP is indicated, the&#xD;
      questionnaires will be repeated during their second polysomnography (standard of care), 3&#xD;
      months after the second polysomnography (standard of care) and 1 year after this last visit&#xD;
      (standard of care). The second polysomnography is needed to estimate the therapeutic pressure&#xD;
      and to meet the criteria for the OSA convention. The time necessary for treatment education&#xD;
      (time to explain function of CPAP), frequency of visits and time necessary to deal with&#xD;
      complications, treatment compliance (hours of use CPAP device), treatment discontinuation&#xD;
      will be monitored. The group with OSA and type D personality will be compared with the OSA&#xD;
      group without type D personality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A search for cardiovascular events in the electronic medical file of all OSA patients with&#xD;
      and without type D personality will be carried out.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The above mentioned procedures will all be carried out in the sleep laboratory of the UZ&#xD;
      Brussel, Laarbeeklaan 101, 1090 Jette.&#xD;
