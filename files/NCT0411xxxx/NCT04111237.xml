  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The majority of newborns transition successfully from intrauterine to extrauterine life&#xD;
      without any assistance. Less than 1% of all newborns will require extensive neonatal&#xD;
      resuscitation involving chest compressions (CC) and medications at birth 1. Chest&#xD;
      compressions are indicated for those newborns whose heart rate remains less than 60 beats per&#xD;
      minute despite adequate ventilation 1. The American Heart Association (AHA) identifies two&#xD;
      different methods of delivering chest compressions; a) the two-thumb (TT) method and b) the&#xD;
      two-finger (TF) method. The two-thumb method is favoured by the AHA as it results in higher&#xD;
      blood pressure and coronary perfusion pressures and can also be delivered from the head of&#xD;
      the bed during umbilical catheter insertion 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The quality of CC plays a vital role in delivering effective cardiopulmonary resuscitation&#xD;
      (CPR). Solevag et al. report that high-quality CC requires (A) optimal&#xD;
      compression:ventilation (C:V) ratio, (B) adequate CC rate, (C) depth of CC as well as (D)&#xD;
      full recoil between compressions 2. The American Heart Association (AHA) recommend delivering&#xD;
      chest compressions on the lower third of the sternum to a depth of one third the&#xD;
      anterior-posterior (AP) chest diameter. The recommended C:V ratio is 3:1 (90 compressions and&#xD;
      30 breaths per minute) 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A number of studies have highlighted the effects of rescuer fatigue on quality of chest&#xD;
      compressions. One study reported adverse effects on CC quality when performed without&#xD;
      interruption over a 3 minute period 6. It has therefore been recommended to rotate rescuers&#xD;
      every 2-3 minutes in order to avoid rescuer fatigue and to ensure high quality CC6-7. As well&#xD;
      as duration of CC, other factors can contribute to greater levels of rescuer fatigue. A&#xD;
      number of studies have looked at the effect of different CC to ventilation methods on rescuer&#xD;
      fatigue. Bodingh et al investigated this during simulated infant CPR. They reported greater&#xD;
      levels of rescuer fatigue during simulated CPR in CCaV (continuous CC with asynchronous&#xD;
      ventilation) at 120 CC per min compared to the recommended 3:1 C:V CPR 3. A similar study was&#xD;
      performed by Li et al where rescuer fatigue was assessed during (i) 3:1 C:V ratio, (ii) CCaV&#xD;
      at 90 CC per min and (iii) CCaV at 120 CC per min. However, unlike Bodingh et al, they found&#xD;
      both 3:1 C:V and CCaV CPR to be equally fatiguing 4. Different CC techniques (TT vs TF&#xD;
      method) can also cause varying levels of rescuer fatigue. In a recent study, Jiang et al&#xD;
      compared the TT and TF chest compression techniques on infant mannequins and found that the&#xD;
      TF method caused greater levels of rescuer fatigue compared with the TT method 5. We&#xD;
      therefore set out to investigate whether different CC techniques cause different levels of&#xD;
      rescuer fatigue during neonatal CPR. We hypothesize that performing TF method on neonatal&#xD;
      mannequins will produce greater levels of rescuer fatigue. The results of this study would&#xD;
      have significant implications in terms of choice of CC technique in new-born resuscitation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to compare rescuer fatigue during simulated neonatal chest&#xD;
      compressions using two different CC methods; the two-finger (TF) method vs two-thumb (TT)&#xD;
      method. This will be performed on both preterm and term mannequins by neonatologists and&#xD;
      level of fatigue will be assessed by measuring change in cardiac output during chest&#xD;
      compressions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: Performing CC using the two-finger (TF) method produces higher levels of rescuer&#xD;
      fatigue compared with the two-thumb (TT) method during 5 minutes of simulated neonatal CPR.&#xD;

      Inclusion criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Neonatology NCHD's from CUMH&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Participants must have completed Neonatal Resuscitation Programme (NRP)&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Participants must be working as doctors in the area of neonatology Exclusion criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
      1. Any history of cardiac or respiratory disorder 2. Physicians who are post-call/sleep&#xD;
      deprived&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This will be a crossover trial. Each participant will be assigned to performing ether TT or&#xD;
      TF chest compressions. The participant will each perform 5 minutes of simulated chest&#xD;
      compressions either a term or preterm mannequin using 3:1 C:V CPR. Each participant will have&#xD;
      NICOM leads attached to their body which will record HR and cardiac output. One week later&#xD;
      the participant will cross over and perform the alternate CC technique. The trial will&#xD;
      initially be performed on a term mannequin for the first 2 weeks before being repeated on a&#xD;
      preterm mannequin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Collection:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recorded data will include: Age, gender, ethnicity, weight, height, BMI, HR and cardiac&#xD;
      output. Participants will have an allocated study number, ensuring that the data collected&#xD;
      will be anonymised. The list of study numbers and data will be stored in a secure password&#xD;
      protected database in the Neonatal Unit. Only people involved in the study and other&#xD;
      authorised persons will have access to this information.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome Measures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Outcome Measure:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Percentage change in cardiac output after 5 minutes of simulated neonatal CPR using two&#xD;
      different chest compression methods (2-finger method vs. 2-thumb method) on term and preterm&#xD;
      mannequins.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Outcome Measure:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Perceived level of fatique. At the end of the study session each subject will complete a&#xD;
      Likert scale-based questionnaire on subjective feeling of fatigue.&#xD;
