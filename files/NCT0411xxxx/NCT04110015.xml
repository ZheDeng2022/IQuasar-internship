      1. To evaluate the accuracy of virtual visual field (VVF) headsets equipped the standard&#xD;
           visual field software in its ability to assess visual function in various retinal,&#xD;
           glaucoma and neuro-ophthalmic disorders by comparing retinal fundus and optic nerve&#xD;
           images, optical coherence tomography and neuroimages to the VVF produced.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To test the null hypothesis that VVF testing compares favorably to the gold standard,&#xD;
           Humphrey visual field (HVF) by comparing testing time, mean sensitivity, markers of&#xD;
           reliability including false positives and negatives and fixation losses and global&#xD;
           indices such as mean deviation and pattern standard deviation.&#xD;

      1. Study Style: Prospective, Controlled Clinical Trial&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. To determine the capacity for a portable head-mounted virtual visual field-testing&#xD;
                device, with capacity for remote testing, to accurately analyze visual function in&#xD;
                various retina, neuro-ophthalmic and glaucoma disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. To compare virtual visual field results with the &quot;gold standard,&quot; Humphrey visual&#xD;
                fields.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Subjects: Consecutive patients already scheduled for visual fields for various retina,&#xD;
           glaucoma and neuro-ophthalmic conditions and normal controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SETTING AND PROTOCOL FOR HUMAN RESEARCH:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Location: Ophthalmology Department, Jacobi Medical Center, Bronx New York.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Recruitment: Patients already presenting to the eye clinic or seen on the wards at&#xD;
           Jacobi Medical Center will be offered a chance to participate as volunteers. No other&#xD;
           active recruitment will be done.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Retention and Dropout: Investigators will encourage patients to complete their testing.&#xD;
           However, it will be made clear that they can drop out at any time without need to&#xD;
           provide a reason. Dropouts will be replaced with other consenting patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Protocol (Interventions and Timing):&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Consecutive patients presenting to the Jacobi eye clinic and wards who are&#xD;
                diagnosed with neurologic, glaucoma and retina conditions and already are scheduled&#xD;
                to have Humphrey visual field analysis, will be asked if they would like to&#xD;
                voluntarily participate in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Interested patients will be have the study explained to them and an informed&#xD;
                consent taken by the study resident/technician.&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. The standard Humphrey visual field (HVF) will be conducted by the technician (5-10&#xD;
                minutes) in the usual manner.&#xD;
&#xD;
             4. The option of doing the virtual fields immediately, on the same day, will be&#xD;
                offered vs returning to conduct the test within 3 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
             5. The virtual reality headset will be applied and instructions in the patient's&#xD;
                preferred language provided through the earpiece of the virtual visual field (VVF).&#xD;
                When the patient indicates they wish to proceed, the test will be started by the&#xD;
                technician.&#xD;
&#xD;
             6. The technician is already versed in conducting both versions of the visual field&#xD;
                tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Clinical Analysis: All fields will be stored digitally within each Health Insurance&#xD;
           Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) compliant device-specific website for later&#xD;
           analyses by respective Attendings (glaucoma, retina and neuro-ophthalmology/neurology).&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Data Collection:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. The patients' demographic details, visual field pattern deviation, and global&#xD;
                indices (mean deviation, f and pattern standard deviation) and reliability indices&#xD;
                (fixation losses, false positives/negatives will be documented in the data&#xD;
                collection Excel sheet.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Supporting ancillary tests (optical coherence tomography, retina photography and&#xD;
                neuroimaging) will be collected for each patient and reported findings documented.&#xD;
                These tests are part of normal standard of care assessment of patients at Jacobi&#xD;
                Medical Center.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY POPULATION:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Consecutive clinic and ward patients (&gt;18yrs old) with glaucoma, retinal or neurological&#xD;
           disorders able to understand, consent and deemed physically able to perform the visual&#xD;
           field tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Power Calculation:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Alpha 0.05&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Power 80%&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Using the findings of mean deviation (MD) in perception of light from a previous&#xD;
                VVF glaucoma study : mean (SD)=-3.78 (7.49) dB units in glaucoma patients and 0.587&#xD;
                (2.588) dB in the controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
             4. 39 patients and 39 controls in each sub-population (retina, glaucoma and&#xD;
                neuro-ophthalmology) will be required to sufficiently power the study. Round&#xD;
                numbers of 40 cases and 40 controls for each study to be sufficiently powered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For all three studies, 120 study cases in total will be tested with clinical conditions and&#xD;
      120 normal cases as normal controls. 240 cases in total will be tested.There will be&#xD;
      confounding variables that can be addressed with subgroup analysis or multivariate regression&#xD;
      analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      INFORMED CONSENT:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The informed consent to participate in the study will be taken at the site of testing at&#xD;
           Jacobi Medical Center.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The informed consent will be taken by one of the study residents or the study&#xD;
           technician.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: Excel and SAS (Statistical Analysis Software, SAS institute Inc. Cary,&#xD;
      North Carolina, USA) software will be used for descriptive assessment and statistical&#xD;
      analysis of the data set and generation of graphs.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Data will be used to test the hypothesis that the virtual visual field headset is able&#xD;
           to accurately detect visual field defects in ophthalmic conditions and develops visual&#xD;
           field maps and global indices that compare favorably with the gold standard, Humphrey&#xD;
           visual fields.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Interim analyses will be conducted for each sub-population (glaucoma, retina, neurology)&#xD;
           when they reach the power number ~40.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Once all data is de-identified, it will be analyzed using SAS software.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Descriptive data will be determined with basic percentages.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Aggregate means of global indices of each study group: retina disorders, glaucoma of all&#xD;
           stages (1-mild; 2-moderate; 3-severe; 4-indeterminate) and neuro-ophthalmic conditions,&#xD;
           will be compared with their control group and VVF compared to HVFusing t-test,&#xD;
           Chi-square, Mann-Whitney and Kruskal-Wallis tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Correlation between the parameters of virtual visual field test and Humphrey visual&#xD;
           field including time for test, mean sensitivity (MS, expressed in decibels), fixation&#xD;
           loss (FL), false negative (FN), false positive (FP), mean deviation (MD) and pattern&#xD;
           standard deviation (PSD) will be assessed using linear regression models that will&#xD;
           account for confounding variables such as age, visual acuity and other ocular&#xD;
           conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Statistical significance will be set at p&lt;0.05.&#xD;
