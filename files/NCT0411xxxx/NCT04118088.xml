  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main aim is to check the long term side effects of a repeat treatment of darvadstrocel&#xD;
      and to see if that treatment improves symptoms of Crohn's disease and complex perianal&#xD;
      fistula. Participants will attend 8 clinic visits and will receive 1 treatment of&#xD;
      darvadstrocel at the third visit. A magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) will be performed&#xD;
      several times during the study.&#xD;

      The biological being tested in this study is called darvadstrocel (Alofisel). This study is&#xD;
      examining the long-term safety and efficacy of a repeat dose of darvadstrocel in people who&#xD;
      have Crohn's disease and complex perianal fistula.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will enroll approximately 50 patients. Participants will be assigned to one&#xD;
      treatment group to receive:&#xD;
&#xD;
      • Darvadstrocel 120 million cells&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants would be allowed to receive one repeat dose of darvadstrocel in the whole&#xD;
      study. This multi-center trial will be conducted worldwide. The overall time to participate&#xD;
      in this study is approximately 3 years. Participants will make multiple visits to the clinic.&#xD;

             gastrointestinal (other than CD), renal, endocrine, pulmonary, cardiac, neurologic, or&#xD;
             psychiatric disease that may result in participant's increased risk from study&#xD;
             participation and/or lack of compliance with study procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
         18. The participant has had major surgery of the gastrointestinal tract within 6 months&#xD;
             before baseline or any minor surgery of the gastrointestinal tract 3 months before&#xD;

&#xD;
         19. The participant had local major perianal surgery, and/or treatment with darvadstrocel&#xD;
             within 6 months before baseline. The abscess drainage, cleaning surgery, or seton&#xD;
             placement are not considered as &quot;local major surgery&quot; in this protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
         20. The participant does not wish to or cannot comply with study procedures.&#xD;
