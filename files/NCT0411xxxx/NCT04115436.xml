      Life-long therapy with oral anticoagulants (OAC) is strongly recommended in AF patients&#xD;
      receiving left atrial appendage isolation (LAAI) to prevent thromboembolic (TE) events.&#xD;
      However, some patients are observed to remain stroke-free while off OACs for years whereas&#xD;
      others experience TE events if OAC is discontinued even for a short period of time.&#xD;
      Therefore, we aim to evaluate the association of genetic variants (single nucleotide&#xD;
      polymorphisms - SNPs) with off-anticoagulation stroke-risk in AF patients.&#xD;

      1. BACKGROUND Atrial fibrillation (AF) is known to be a leading cause of thrombo-embolic&#xD;
           (TE) events (1).The left atrial appendage (LAA), an embryological remnant of the&#xD;
           primitive left atrium, has been reported to be the source of thrombus formation in more&#xD;
           than 90% of patients with non-valvular AF (2). More specifically, the loss of&#xD;
           contractile function in the LAA following electrical isolation of the appendage (LAAI)&#xD;
           leads to stasis and thrombus formation, which may then embolize into the systemic&#xD;
           circulation. For this reason, life-long oral anticoagulation (OAC) is strongly&#xD;
           recommended in post-LAAI cases to reduce the stroke-risk. However, intolerance to OAC,&#xD;
           non-compliance, increase in the risk of bleeding in patients with bleeding disorders or&#xD;
           in elderly with high fall-risk and difficulty in maintaining the therapeutic level for&#xD;
           certain novel oral anticoagulants in patients with renal dysfunction are several&#xD;
           limitations of the OAC therapy (3). Furthermore, patients occasionally need to&#xD;
           discontinue OACs as advised by their treating physicians while undergoing other medical&#xD;
           procedures. Patient-preference and non-compliance are other important reasons for OAC&#xD;
           discontinuation.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Whatever may be the cause, the consequence in terms of TE events, is observed to be&#xD;
           highly variable. Some patients experience a TE event after withdrawal of OAC for a very&#xD;
           short period while others remain stroke-free even after years while off OAC therapy.&#xD;
           This intriguing observation triggers a vital question; does genetics play a role in&#xD;
           increasing predisposition to stroke or providing protection from TE events? The current&#xD;
           pilot study aims to address that question as understanding the underlying molecular&#xD;
           mechanism would be highly useful in risk-prediction, counselling and optimal management&#xD;
           of post-LAAI patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Prior studies have reported an association between several single-nucleotide&#xD;
           polymorphisms (SNPs) with stroke in patients with or without AF (4-19). Most were&#xD;
           documented to be linked with elevated stroke-risk whereas few were found to have a&#xD;
           protective impact. However, SNPs associated with stroke in the post-LAAI cases have not&#xD;
           been elucidated yet. More importantly, it is not known why discontinuation of OAC has a&#xD;
           differential impact on this high-risk population. Therefore, in this pilot study, we aim&#xD;
           to test a number of SNPS (a list is provided at the end of the protocol) in post-LAAI&#xD;
           cases to determine their association with stroke after discontinuation of OAC.&#xD;
&#xD;
           1.1 Safety This study poses minimal risk to the subject. More specifically, the risks&#xD;
           are those that are associated with venipuncture (pain, bleeding, bruising, infection,&#xD;
           and inflammation at the site), during the single blood specimen collection.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. STUDY RATIONALE We hypothesize that there will be significant differences in the allele&#xD;
           frequencies of SNPs among patients with and without TE events.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. STUDY OBJECTIVES 3.1 Primary Objective To compare the SNP profile of post-LAAI patients&#xD;
           that have or have not experienced any TE events after discontinuation of OAC.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. STUDY DESIGN 4.1 Study Overview This is a single center, observational clinical trial.&#xD;
           Subjects who meet all inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria will be&#xD;
           screened and consecutive consenting patients will be enrolled in the study. We will&#xD;
           screen all patients that have stopped OAC after LAAI and enroll the consenting patients&#xD;
           that have or have not experienced stroke during discontinuation of OAC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The total duration of subject participation will be 1 day. The total duration of the study is&#xD;
      expected to be 1 year.&#xD;
