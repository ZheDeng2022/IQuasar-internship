    <textblock>
      MODIFY study is a multi-centre prospective, longitudinal, observational cohort study which&#xD;
      aims to recruit 150 adult patients with type 2 diabetes recruited from community, primary&#xD;
      care or secondary care settings. The total length of the study is 75 months. The aim of the&#xD;
      study is to develop an MRI-based method to identify whom amongst people with Type 2 diabetes&#xD;
      are at risk of further complications in their kidney, liver and cardiovascular system.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There has been a surge in incidence of the metabolic syndrome; a cluster of conditions which&#xD;
      increase the risk of, type 2 diabetes (T2D) (90% of diabetes cases), non-alcoholic fatty&#xD;
      liver disease (NAFLD), non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), cardiovascular disease&#xD;
      (including ischaemic heart disease and heart failure), ischaemic or haemorrhagic stroke&#xD;
&#xD;
      This project concentrates on T2D, a disease whose multiple patho-physiological defects&#xD;
      include; increased renal glucose re-absorption, decreased peripheral glucose utilisation,&#xD;
      increased hepatic glucose production due to insulin resistance, increased glucagon secretion,&#xD;
      reduced insulin secretion (pancreas), and incretin secretion (gastrointestinal tract)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Estimated UK prevalence of T2D is 5.26%. This represents 3.3 million people (comparatively in&#xD;
      the US, 9.1% or 26.44 million people), which equates to Â£8.8bn in associated healthcare costs&#xD;
      in UK.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Type 2 diabetes is associated with a heterogeneity in its aetiology - this is observed in its&#xD;
      clinical presentation and subsequent rate of progression. Further factors associated with T2D&#xD;
      include micro-and macrovascular complications and an observed decline in multiple organs&#xD;
      (end-organ damage). End-organ damage contributes to the clinical picture of individuals with&#xD;
      T2D and is demonstrated when observing the high prevalence of co-morbidities in this patient&#xD;
      cohort. For example, the presence of NAFLD is seen in 60% of T2D patients, along with a&#xD;
      34.2-50.7% presence of chronic kidney disease (CKD) and a 32.2% presence of cardiovascular&#xD;
      disease (CVD).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently, T2D and its complications are monitored using circulating plasma and serum&#xD;
      biomarkers. However, these lack sufficient sensitivity or specificity. An example of this is&#xD;
      highlighted in one researcher's preliminary data that suggests that 85% of obese people with&#xD;
      T2D had NAFLD, detected by MRI. However, a vast proportion of this patient cohort have&#xD;
      recorded normal biochemical biomarkers, such as Alanine Transaminase (ALT).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Metformin is typically the initially treatment for T2D. However, due to its progressive&#xD;
      nature, metformin monotherapy proves to be inadequate in maintaining long-term glycaemic&#xD;
      control. Metformin has been used safely and effectively for decades, but newer drugs are&#xD;
      becoming available. Numerous recent studies have shown that newer drug classes, including the&#xD;
      SGLT-2 inhibitors and GLP1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RA), have substantial beneficial effects&#xD;
      beyond modulation of glycaemic levels, and can confer protection against CVD and CKD. It is&#xD;
      now recommended that use of these drugs is advocated for high risk populations with evidence&#xD;
      of CKD or CVD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This proposal aims to develop an MRI-based method that is able to identify the individuals at&#xD;
      high risk of disease complications, looking particularly at renal, hepatic and cardiovascular&#xD;
      pathology, and further compare this to the conventional biochemical approach. This has future&#xD;
      potential in assisting in the stratification of patients to the most appropriate tailored&#xD;
      treatment for their disease. The investigators will further evaluate the additional&#xD;
      synergistic value of incorporating MRI-metrics into patient pathways.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is a healthcare need to provide further decision-making support for clinicians in the&#xD;
      care of patients at risk or diagnosed with T2D. This would combine multi-modality approaches,&#xD;
      an incorporation of biochemical evaluation and imaging techniques. There is also a pressing&#xD;
      need for treatment stratification to identify the T2D patients who would benefit from being&#xD;
      triaged to receive the newer, more expensive drugs. This would also empower patients and aid&#xD;
      in their engagement of the lifestyle changes often required for treatment. This should have&#xD;
      the added benefit of reducing associated NHS costs by minimising the pool of patients with&#xD;
      severe disease, who would be highlighted through early detection and early medical&#xD;
      management.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To address this growing need, the investigators propose adding a complementary imaging aspect&#xD;
      to the currently used biomarkers. MRI, specifically, provides excellent soft-tissue contrast.&#xD;
      Perspectum's LiverMultiScan is a quantitative multiparametric MRI method, FDA-cleared and&#xD;
      CE-marked, that is used to detect and stage early liver disease. It is already widely used in&#xD;
      pharmaceutical trials for NAFLD therapeutics. The MRI metrics from LiverMultiScan can&#xD;
      quantify changes to liver tissue characteristics, like fibro-inflammation and fat, as a&#xD;
      result of intervention (for example, bariatric surgery). The accuracy and reproducibility of&#xD;
      LiverMultiScan has been demonstrated in studies scanning patients within different MRI&#xD;
      scanners. It continues to be further supported by data from clinical trials in liver disease&#xD;
      cohorts, from comparative studies that include healthy controls, as well as whole-population&#xD;
      studies in the UK and US.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With this proposal the investigators aim to develop a new MRI image analysis technique,&#xD;
      &quot;ATLAS&quot;, that builds on LiverMultiScan technology. the investigators also plan to gather&#xD;
      clinical evidence that will demonstrate the potential added value to the NHS, as well as&#xD;
      support future regulatory clearance. The phenotypical information that ATLAS delivers,&#xD;
      combined with information from circulating biomarkers, will form the basis of a future&#xD;
      clinical decision support tool for T2D.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Perspectum has pilot data showing that LiverMultiScan can estimate portal hypertension&#xD;
      (spleen), detect pancreatitis, and characterise the tissue of the kidneys.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This proposal will extend LiverMultiScan to each of the other relevant organs - pancreas,&#xD;
      kidneys and spleen. The technical development of &quot;ATLAS&quot; will be complemented by the&#xD;
      accumulation and analysis of clinical data, circulating biomarkers and imaging. This&#xD;
      information will be obtained from three diverse UK clinical centres (Liverpool, Oxford and&#xD;
      London).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The innovation comes from combining a number of quantitative MRI metrics to achieve this:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  volumes - for liver, spleen, kidneys, pancreas;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  fibroinflammation: cT1 and/or T1 - for liver, spleen, kidneys, pancreas;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  fat infiltration: PDFF - for liver, kidneys, pancreas;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  aortic distensibility and diameter. The investigators will also incorporate kidney&#xD;
           diffusion and renal flow. There will be strong patient and clinician involvement in the&#xD;
           collection of patient-reported experience and outcome measures throughout the study&#xD;
           (PREMs and PROMs), both qualitative and quantitative, to reflect the patients'&#xD;
           experience of the clinical care pathway.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The resulting MRI diagnostic solution will enable rapid and comprehensive stratification of&#xD;
      T2D and affiliated diseases (NAFLD, CKD, CVD), allowing clinicians to facilitate personalised&#xD;
      medicine. It is anticipated that adopting a clinical approach which utilises ATLAS will&#xD;
      result in substantial cost savings for the NHS and will help improve patient experience by&#xD;
      providing access to advanced treatments to those patients most at risk.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective of this study is to assess the health of multiple organs over a period of&#xD;
      9 months, using multiparametric abdominal MRI, in patients with type 2 diabetes who have been&#xD;
      prescribed glucose lowering therapy (as per their standard of care).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This will be a multi-site study adopting a prospective, observational, longitudinal, cohort&#xD;
      study design. There will be no intervention to the standard of care. Participants will be&#xD;
      required to attend a screening visit and additional study visits on up to three time points -&#xD;
      baseline (visit 1), a visit within 21 days of baseline (visit 2) and at 9-months (visit 3).&#xD;
      The second and third visit will involve having a multiparametric MRI scan. Where possible,&#xD;
      some visits (the screening visit visit 1 or visit 1 /visit 2) may be on the same day or&#xD;
      within standard of care, depending on patient and MRI scanner availability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with type 2 diabetes and prescribed with glucose lowering therapy (as per standard&#xD;
      of care) will be recruited from community settings, primary care centres and diabetes clinics&#xD;
      within secondary care settings. The investigators aim to recruit patients who have been newly&#xD;
      prescribed medication; also those patients undergoing treatment intensification (when an&#xD;
      additional treatment is being considered due to evidence of poor glycaemic control), as per&#xD;
      their standard of care HbA1c level results. Clinical outcome measurements, blood samples and&#xD;
      urine samples will be collected to assess the response to standard of care treatment. There&#xD;
      will be an optional thoracic echocardiogram (ECHO) included at visit 2. This is a&#xD;
      non-invasive way in which the investigators can capture data to enable us to assess&#xD;
      cardiovascular disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study participants will be enrolled in this study for a total of 5-years. During this time,&#xD;
      consented participants will be asked to attend for up to 3 study visits: Visit 1 (baseline),&#xD;
      Visit 2 and Visit 3. Further to this, participants will be asked to give consent to the&#xD;
      review of their medical records at 3 time points - years 1, 3, and 5, following baseline&#xD;
      assessment. This review will be conducted by authorised study investigators who will obtain&#xD;
      clinical outcome measures relating to the study objectives, for example, measures of liver or&#xD;
      kidney function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary endpoint of the study is to compare the MRI metrics for liver fibroinflammation&#xD;
      in those patients with type 2 diabetes at baseline vs. individuals who are healthy and&#xD;
      non-diabetic. Values for the healthy, non-diabetics will be provided from data from the UK&#xD;
      Biobank (UKBB) and will be selected based on the matching of gender, age, ethnicity to the&#xD;
      patients from this study with type 2 diabetes. Analysis will be based on a two-sample,&#xD;
      two-sided t-test. The sample size required to perform a t-test with 90% power and alpha of&#xD;
      0.05 would require n=150.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be identified from the community, primary care and secondary care&#xD;
      diabetes;appointments; specifically those patients with type 2 diabetes who are prescribed&#xD;
      glucose lowering treatment as per their standard of care. A member of the clinical care team&#xD;
      will provide potential participants with a study invitation letter and an accompanying&#xD;
      Participant Information Leaflet (PIL) in the following places: Liverpool Diabetes&#xD;
      Partnership/University Hospital Aintree, The Oxford Centre for Diabetes, Endocrinology and&#xD;
      Metabolism (OCDEM) Oxford University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, The Royal Free London&#xD;
      NHS Foundation Trust - Diabetes Department.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At each study centre, posters will be displayed around the hospitals, University departmental&#xD;
      buildings and GP practices so that potential participants can also self-refer into the study&#xD;
      by contacting the study team directly. The study will also be advertised on social media&#xD;
      platforms (for example, Twitter and Facebook), Perspectum Diagnostics Ltd's website and also&#xD;
      hospital websites. . Once a potential participant has been identified by any of these means,&#xD;
      and has expressed an interest in taking part in the study, they will be sent a Participant&#xD;
      Information Leaflet (PIL) to read. They will be allowed as much time as they require to&#xD;
      understand the details of the study and what's involved before signing the consent form.&#xD;
