  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Intermittent claudication (IC), the most common manifestation of peripheral artery disease&#xD;
      (PAD), represents not only a significant detriment in quality of life, but also an increased&#xD;
      risk for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), including progression of PAD,&#xD;
      coronary artery disease (CAD) and cerebrovascular disease. Guideline directed therapy for IC&#xD;
      includes supervised exercise, smoking cessation and optimal medical management to decrease&#xD;
      overall risk of ASCVD. In the VA Health Care System, implementation of supervised exercise&#xD;
      therapy through cardiac rehabilitation or physical therapy programs is limited by distances&#xD;
      that patients must travel to VA facilities that provide these services. Furthermore, one of&#xD;
      the most common failure points in exercise therapy programs is poor patient compliance.&#xD;
      Improved patient participation and compliance in exercise programs for IC represents an unmet&#xD;
      need, without which the majority of patients with life-style limiting PAD may not be&#xD;
      receiving optimal medical management.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Small studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of home-based exercise programs as an&#xD;
      alternative to supervised exercise therapy; however, the success of the home-based exercise&#xD;
      programs require remote coaching and/or regular provider feedback. The wide-spread&#xD;
      availability of smart phones and smart devices has accelerated the implementation of&#xD;
      telehealth programs that may supplement or may eventually replace in-person encounters for&#xD;
      health care delivery. The role of provider feedback in addition to real-time feedback from&#xD;
      smart devices remains completely unexplored. Our central hypothesis is that in individuals&#xD;
      with IC, regular provider feedback on smart-device-based remote health monitoring data, which&#xD;
      is available to the patient in real time, will augment the benefits of home-based exercise&#xD;
      programs. We propose a randomized trial in patients with IC to test the central hypothesis&#xD;
      through two Specific Aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To determine the effect of provider feedback on smart-device-based remote health&#xD;
           monitoring data during home-based exercise programs on walking distance in patients with&#xD;
           IC.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To determine the effect of provider feedback on smart-device-based remote health&#xD;
           monitoring data during home-based exercise programs on quality of life (QOL) in patients&#xD;
           with IC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on a sample size calculation to detect a 50% increase in walking distance between the 2&#xD;
      groups, we expect to enroll 30 patients (15 in each group). Patient participation in the&#xD;
      study will be concluded after 12 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As an exploratory aim in the study, we will also (as an optional part of the study) collect&#xD;
      plasma before and after the 12-weeks of exercise to investigate changes in lipid levels and&#xD;
      plasma biomarkers associated with exercise therapy. This exploratory aim will generate&#xD;
      preliminary data for future studies.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study design is that of a prospective randomized study of patients presenting to the&#xD;
      vascular surgery and cardiology clinics with symptoms of IC and enrolled in 12-week&#xD;
      supervised exercise program. Upon enrollment, each patient will undergo a medical and&#xD;
      surgical history, ascertainment of smoking status, review of medications, and 6-minute walk&#xD;
      test (walking on a flat, pre-defined course(i.e. hallway) for 6 minutes and recording time&#xD;
      and distance to claudication onset as well as total distance walked, and total number of&#xD;
      steps taken). We will also collect data from the patient's CPRS notes through our&#xD;
      institutional cardiac rehab/PAD rehab program, with a dedicated cardiac rehab nurse. Patients&#xD;
      with IC who are enrolled in the study will also be asked to complete 2 QOL questionnaires:&#xD;
      the VASCUQoL6 and the Walking Impairment Questionnaire (WIQ). Patients will undergo&#xD;
      supervised exercise therapy (per cardiac rehab protocol) and will receive the LIVMOR health&#xD;
      monitoring system with instructions on how to use it. Randomization and details of exercise&#xD;
      therapy are described in the next section. Patients will be followed for up to 12 weeks to&#xD;
      collect data regarding change in distance and time of claudication onset.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the optional exploratory aim, we will analyze plasma from one blood draw at the beginning&#xD;
      and at the end of exercise therapy for lipid levels, distribution of LDL particle size, and&#xD;
      other biomarkers. We will perform metabolomics, proteomics, and lipidomics assays to examine&#xD;
      small circulating molecules that are involved in the development of atherosclerotic plaque in&#xD;
      peripheral arterial disease. All blood and plasma analysis performed outside of Pathology and&#xD;
      the Clinical Core Lab will be performed in the PI's research laboratory at the Dallas VA&#xD;
      Medical Center by members of the research staff, or by members of the PI's collaborating lab&#xD;
      at UT Southwestern or in the UT Southwestern research Core Laboratories. Any plasma sent to&#xD;
      UT Southwestern will be de-identified.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data (including name, birth date, social security number, dates of procedures and studies)&#xD;
      will be stored in an Excel spreadsheet. Each patient's data will be associated with a study&#xD;
      ID and stripped of the 18 identifiers need to de-identify the data. Only study staff will&#xD;
      have access to PHI. No PHI will be released outside the North Texas VA Health Care Systems.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the LIVMOR system, only the patient's study ID will be entered into the system.&#xD;
      De-identified health monitoring data (heart rate, steps taken, distance walked) will be&#xD;
      transmitted and stored in the LIVMOR cloud server, as was done in the LIVMOR Data Collection&#xD;
      Study (IRB# 17-106).&#xD;
&#xD;
      After enrollment, baseline data, including questionnaires, will be collected. Patients who&#xD;
      have agreed to optional blood draw will have a fasting blood draw (up to 10 cc) at the next&#xD;
      available time within 1 week of study enrollment. At the next supervised exercise therapy&#xD;
      visit (occurs 3 times a week according to the cardiac rehab protocol), the patient will have&#xD;
      baseline resting heart rate and blood pressure measurements, and will undergo a 6-minute walk&#xD;
      test. The patient will be randomized to remote coaching (regular provider feedback based on&#xD;
      LIVMOR data) vs. remote health monitoring without provider feedback. Each patient will be&#xD;
      sent home with instructions for home-based supplemental exercise and a LIVMOR remote health&#xD;
      monitoring system, which includes a wristwatch that records heart rate, steps taken, and&#xD;
      distance traveled (pedometer function) and a tablet. Patients will be instructed to check a&#xD;
      resting heart rate with the LIVMOR watch for 10 minutes before starting exercise. They will&#xD;
      exercise while wearing the watch (heart rate monitor and pedometer), then check heart rate&#xD;
      for 10 minutes after completion of the exercise session. Patients will not receive real time&#xD;
      feedback from the smart-watch heart rate monitor, however they have the option to review&#xD;
      their heart rate and pedometer data by logging into the tablet provided with the watch, after&#xD;
      the exercise session. In patients randomized to the remote coaching arm, study staff will&#xD;
      provide feedback on home-based supplemental exercise based on heart rate measurements and&#xD;
      pedometer measurements from the LIVMOR health monitoring system, as well as heart rate and&#xD;
      walking data collected from supervised exercise therapy sessions. Remote coaching will occur&#xD;
      by telephone call, but the conversation will mirror conversations that occur during&#xD;
      supervised exercise therapy, and will not be based solely on the surrogate measure of heart&#xD;
      rate for walking effort. A member of the study team will call the patient 1-3 times a week,&#xD;
      depending on the patient's preference, which may change over the course of the study.&#xD;
      Therefore the remote coaching is adaptive to patient's needs. In patients randomized to no&#xD;
      remote coaching, health monitoring data will be reviewed by study staff, but will not be used&#xD;
      to adjust home-based supplemental exercise. Any abnormalities in health monitoring data will&#xD;
      be alerted to appropriate clinical staff. All patients will keep a journal of their&#xD;
      home-based supplemental exercise, including time of exercise, in order to correlate heart&#xD;
      rate readings from the smart-watch.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For patients agreeing to the optional blood draw: Blood will be sent to the Dallas VA Medical&#xD;
      Center clinical lab for a lipid panel. The remaining blood will be refrigerated, then&#xD;
      transported to the PI's research lab at the Dallas VA Medical Center, where the research&#xD;
      staff will centrifuge the blood to isolate plasma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Plasma will be tested for the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Metabolomics, proteomics, and lipidomics assays to study small circulating molecules&#xD;
           that may be involved in the development of atherosclerosis in peripheral arterial&#xD;
           disease, and may change with exercise therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Lipoprotein subfractions.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Small molecules that can be assayed using ELISA. At the end of the 12-week program, an&#xD;
           end-of-study 6 minute walk test will be performed as well as the questionnaires will be&#xD;
           completed. All the LIVMOR devices will be returned to the investigators. If the patient&#xD;
           is unable to complete the end-of study 6-min walk test or does not complete the 12-week&#xD;
           exercise program, a phone follow- up will be done to complete the questionnaires. A&#xD;
           final blood draw will be completed (within 1 week of completing the 12-week exercise&#xD;
           program) for patients who have opted for the blood draw.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The LIVMOR system transmits data through wireless technology up to a cloud server. The data&#xD;
      transmission is encrypted and FIPS-140-2 compliant.&#xD;
