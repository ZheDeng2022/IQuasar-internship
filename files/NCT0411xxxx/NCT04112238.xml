  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is a prospective clinical study which investigates the use of new diagnostic&#xD;
      methods to localize aggressive lymphoma involving the central nervous system(CNS). By&#xD;
      measuring cell-free tumor DNA and metabolomics in cerebrospinal fluid and blood in patients&#xD;
      with systemic Diffuse Large B-cell Lymphoma the investigators aim to improve the diagnostic&#xD;
      certainty of an impending relapse of lymphoma in CNS.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Diffuse Large B-cell Lymphoma is a malignant, aggressive cancer representing 40% of&#xD;
      Non-Hodgkin Lymphomas globally. The risk of relapse after primary treatment is approximately&#xD;
      30% of which up to 10 % occurs in the central nervous system (CNS). The prognosis after CNS&#xD;
      relapse is severely discouraging with an overall survival of 3-6 months. Currently CNS&#xD;
      relapse is diagnosed by either flow cytometry performed on cerebrospinal fluid or a&#xD;
      stereotactic biopsy based on tumor localization by an MRI scan. Both diagnostic methods&#xD;
      however require a certain tumor mass in order avoid false negative test results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to learn whether tumor-derived cell-free circulating DNA (cfDNA)&#xD;
      and/or metabolite profiles from diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) cells can be identified&#xD;
      in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), before the malignant cells themselves are detectable in&#xD;
      CSF. Thus the investigators aim to investigate the diagnostic potential of cfDNA and/or&#xD;
      metabolites measured in blood and cerebrospinal fluid. The study is based on the following&#xD;
      four hypotheses:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 1: Measurement of cfDNA and/or metabolites in CSF are more sensitive methods of&#xD;
      detecting DLBCL involvement in CNS compared to conventional diagnostics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 2: Quantitative cfDNA/metabolomics in CSF has independent prognostic value in&#xD;
      DLBCL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 3: cfDNA and/or metabolite profile in CSF detected at primary diagnosis predicts&#xD;
      relapse of DLBCL in the CNS also when CNS-IPI is taken into account.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 4: Particular aberrations of cfDNA and/or metabolite profiles detected in blood&#xD;
      (plasma) may, in some cases, be associated with CNS involvement in DLBCL patients and/or&#xD;
      predict CNS relapse.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is composed of a pilot study including 5 patients with verified either primary or&#xD;
      secondary CNS lymphoma followed by two studies: One including 40 patients with de novo DLBCL&#xD;
      and one including 30 patients in a relapse setting. The patients will have to consent to&#xD;
      having a lumbar puncture performed and blood samples taken before treatment initiation. After&#xD;
      treatment a second set of lumbar puncture and blood samples will be requested.&#xD;
