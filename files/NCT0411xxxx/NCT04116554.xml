      OPEN CARDIAC SURGERY may cause severe postoperative pain and promote a high risk of chronic&#xD;
      pain if not treated adequately, that is caused by multiple factors; sternotomy,&#xD;
      costotransverse and costovertebral joint distensions, opening of the pericardium, internal&#xD;
      mammarian artery harvesting, surgical manipulation of the parietal pleura, chest tube&#xD;
      insertion and other musculoskeletal trauma that occurs during surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adequate analgesia is important not only for patient comfort, but for weaning from ventilator&#xD;
      and prevention of respiratory complications. Opioids are used to provide analgesia, but they&#xD;
      are associated with significant side effects which include sedation, respiratory depression,&#xD;
      nausea, and vomiting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Severe sternotomy pain in cardiac surgery has been reported in up to 49% of patients at rest&#xD;
      and 78% at movement. Of the various options for postoperative pain relief in cardiac surgery,&#xD;
      we have chosen an ultrasound-guided transversus thoracic muscle plane (TTP) block versus sham&#xD;
      block performed by the anesthesiologist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Transversus thoracic muscle plane (TTP) block and The pecto-intercostal fascial plane block&#xD;
      can block multiple anterior branches of the intercostal nerves (T2 to 6), which dominate the&#xD;
      internal mammary region with a single injection bilaterally.&#xD;

      After approval of the institutional ethics committee and written informed consent, (70)&#xD;
      patients scheduled for open heart surgery including valve replacement or adult congenital&#xD;
      (ASD or VSD) in Fayoum university hospital from May 2019 to November 2020 will be enrolled in&#xD;
      this randomized prospective double blinded study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be divided into two groups randomized by computer generated random numbers that&#xD;
      will be placed in separate opaque envelopes that will be opened by study investigators just&#xD;
      before the block.Neither the participants, the study investigators, the attending clinicians,&#xD;
      nor the data collectors will be aware of groups' allocation until the study end. The&#xD;
      Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) recommendations for reporting&#xD;
      randomized, controlled clinical trials will be followed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group A which will have an ultrasound-guided bilateral transversus thoracic muscle plane&#xD;
      (TTP) block.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group B which will have sham block bilaterally. All patients will be preoperatively examined&#xD;
      and investigated by complete blood count, coagulation profile, renal and kidney functions and&#xD;
      electrolytes. Electrocardiography, chest x ray and echocardiography will be routinely done.&#xD;
      Coronary angiography and carotid arterial duplex will be requested on demand.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient will be premedicated by intramuscular injection of 10mg morphine at morning of the&#xD;
      operation. Before induction of anesthesia, a five-lead electrocardiography system will be&#xD;
      applied to monitor heart rate, rhythm, and ST segments (leads II and V5). A pulse oximeter&#xD;
      probe will be attached, and a peripheral venous cannula will be placed. For measurement of&#xD;
      arterial pressure and blood sampling, a 20 G cannula will be inserted into either right or&#xD;
      left radial artery under local anesthesia. After pre-oxygenation, general anesthesia will be&#xD;
      induced by midazolam 2-5 mg, fentanyl (10μg/kg), propofol (3-4mg/Kg), followed by atracurium&#xD;
      (0.5 mg/kg).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Trachea will be intubated; patients will be mechanically ventilated with oxygen in air so as&#xD;
      to achieve normocarbia. This will be confirmed by radial arterial blood gas analysis and&#xD;
      capnogram. An esophageal temperature probe and a Foley catheter will also be placed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For drug infusion, a triple-lumen central venous catheter will be inserted via the right&#xD;
      internal jugular vein.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anesthesia will be maintained by inhaled Isoflurane 0.4 to 1% and atracurium infusion at a&#xD;
      rate of 0.5 mg/kg/h for continued muscle relaxation. During extracorporeal circulation,&#xD;
      patients will receive propofol infusion at a rate of 50-100 µ/kg/min. in addition to&#xD;
      atracurium infusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before initiation of cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB), the patients will receive intravenous&#xD;
      heparin (300-500 units/kg body weight) to achieve an activated clotting time &gt;480s. CPB will&#xD;
      be instituted via an ascending aortic cannula and a two-stage right atrial cannula. Before,&#xD;
      during (pump blood flow: 2.4l/min/m2), and after CPB, mean arterial pressure will be adjusted&#xD;
      to exceed 60mmHg. Cardiac arrest will be induced with cold ante-grade blood cardioplegia.&#xD;
      Lactate-enriched Ringer's solution will be added to the CPB circuit to maintain reservoir&#xD;
      volume when needed, and packed red blood cells will be added when hemoglobin concentration&#xD;
      decrease to less than 7g/dl.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After rewarming the patient to 37°C and separation from CPB; reversal of heparin by protamine&#xD;
      sulfate (1:1), and sternal closure will be achieved. The study solution (bupivacaine 0.25% or&#xD;
      normal saline will be prepared in the operating room by anesthesiology intern). For carrying&#xD;
      out either block bilaterally the skin on either side of the sternum will be prepared with&#xD;
      povidone iodine solution. Then a linear ultrasound probe (Philips clear vue350, Philips&#xD;
      healthcare, Andover MAO1810, USA, Machine ID: 1385, Nile medical center, service@nilemed.net)&#xD;
      will be placed on the right and left sides at 3cm from the midsternum. On the surface plane,&#xD;
      the subcutaneous tissue is identified, in the intermediate plane, the pectoralis major&#xD;
      muscle, the intercostal muscles and the ribs, and in the deep plane the transverse thoracic&#xD;
      muscle, the pleura and the lungs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group A: will have an ultrasound-guided bilateral transversus thoracic muscle plane (TTP)&#xD;
      block. After identification of the anatomical plane between the internal intercostal and the&#xD;
      transversus thoracic muscles a 22-gauge short bevel needle (Spinocan, B. Braun Melsungen AG,&#xD;
      Germany) will be inserted between the fourth and fifth ribs connecting at the sternum.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Correct needle placement will be confirmed by visualizing the needle in plane along its&#xD;
      entire length and the tip of the needle between both muscles, then1 ml of anesthetic liquid&#xD;
      will be introduced after confirming a negative aspiration. Appropriate injection to&#xD;
      accomplish the TTP block will be indicated by Local anesthetic spread deep to the costal&#xD;
      cartilages and downward displacement of the pleura. The TTP blocks will be administered by&#xD;
      injection of 20 mL of 0.25% bupivacaine and the same procedure will be repeated on the other&#xD;
      side.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group B: will have sham block bilaterally. The same technique of TTP block will be used to do&#xD;
      sham block on either sides of the chest. 20 ml of 0.9%saline will be injected on each side.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tracheal extubation will be performed when the patient met the following criteria:&#xD;
      awake/arousable, hemodynamically stable, no active bleeding, warm peripheries, and&#xD;
      satisfactory arterial blood gas with an FIO2 &lt; 0.5, pressure support on ventilator reduced to&#xD;
      10 Cm H2O, Positive End Expiratory Pressure 5-7 CmH2O, no electrolyte abnormalities, minimal&#xD;
      inotropic support, or no escalation in inotropic support.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Postoperative analgesia in ICU will be carried out for both groups with the conventional way&#xD;
      by the intensivest using opioids (fentanyl), and the total 24 h. opioid consumption will be&#xD;
      recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measured parameters:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome is Total opioid (fentanyl) consumption (time frame: from the time of ICU&#xD;
      admission up to 24 h).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcomes will include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. VAS score for sternal pain both during rest and with cough (ranging from 0 indicating no&#xD;
           pain to 10 indicating extreme pain) judged by objective pain score (table: 1) measured&#xD;
           at time intervals: 30 minutes, 1h., 3h.,6h.,12h., and 24h.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Time to extubation (time frame: from the time of ICU admission up to 24 h).&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Patient satisfaction (measured as poor, good or excellent).&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Hemodynamic variables (HR, SaO2, MABP and inotropic support). (Time frame: from the time&#xD;
           of ICU admission up to 24 h).&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Nausea and vomiting.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Other complications including; infection, hematoma or local anesthetic toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. ICU length of stay (Time frame: from the time of ICU admission up to discharge to the&#xD;
           ward).&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. Total length stay of hospital (in days).&#xD;
&#xD;
      STATISTICAL ANALYSIS AND SAMPLE SIZE ESTIMATION:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size was calculated using (G power version 3). Minimal sample size of patients was 31&#xD;
      in each group needed to get power level 0.90, alpha level 0.05 and 30% as a difference&#xD;
      between the two groups in the morphine consumption after the intervention. To overcome&#xD;
      problem of loss of follow up, calculated sample size was increased by 10% to reach 35 in each&#xD;
      group.&#xD;
