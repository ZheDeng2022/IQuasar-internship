  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is well established that screening for Down syndrome should be offered in the first&#xD;
      trimester to each pregnant woman. The most common screening method is nowadays the first&#xD;
      trimester combined test which consists of a Bayesian analysis of the a priori risk of&#xD;
      maternal age for Down's syndrome, and the posterior risk combining serum biomarkers such as&#xD;
      beta fraction of the human chorionic gonadotropin (Î²-hCG), pregnancy-associated plasma&#xD;
      protein-A (PAPP-A), and nuchal translucency measurement. Women at high risk for trisomy 21 or&#xD;
      18 using this combined test are eligible for chorionic villous sampling or amniocentesis for&#xD;
      a final diagnosis. In recent years there has been a huge advance in prenatal screening for&#xD;
      Down's syndrome with the advent of cell free DNA testing with higher sensitivity and&#xD;
      specificity than the combined test, in which a positive result must be also confirmed by an&#xD;
      invasive diagnostic procedure. But as the range of options broadens, also the need for health&#xD;
      education to allow women to have an adequately informed decision process on which prenatal&#xD;
      test better suits their needs. In multicultural cities, this has become especially important&#xD;
      to integrate patient's values and expectations to an evidence-based decision regarding&#xD;
      prenatal testing. There is high-quality evidence demonstrating that aversion to risk of fetal&#xD;
      loss related to an invasive test may come from incomplete information, shaping the attitude&#xD;
      towards which test to choose from the mother's point of view. And the disbelief that by&#xD;
      taking cfDNA testing the risk of miscarriage would be reduced.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Many information is available about preferences and attitudes in prenatal testing from&#xD;
      Northern European studies, but scarce information is available from Southern Europe, where&#xD;
      the amniocentesis rate in the nineties was as high as 40% of the urban pregnant population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that when enough information is given before the initial&#xD;
      screening, women will overcome aversion to invasive testing and will be more likely to choose&#xD;
      this method as their first choice when compared to women having routine care.&#xD;

      Study design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a randomized open-label controlled trial evaluating the impact of an extra 15-minute&#xD;
      prenatal counseling before the first trimester combined screening test for Down's syndrome,&#xD;
      on the women's attitudes and preferences towards having invasive testing as the first-line&#xD;
      option for the screening of chromosomal abnormalities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will be collected by the study-site manager and stored in an electronic data-capture&#xD;
      database. The coordinator of the study and the statistician will witness the accuracy of the&#xD;
      data at the beginning, middle, and end of the study (on-site audit). Data will be captured in&#xD;
      a paper form basis and then captured into the electronic database.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size calculation has been made using an independent two-sample proportions&#xD;
      likelihood-ratio test. The investigators expect a 10% of women willing to have an invasive&#xD;
      procedure as a first-line test for aneuploidies in the control group, and a 25% difference to&#xD;
      those in the experimental group that is given an extra 15-minute prenatal counseling, this&#xD;
      yields a sample of 42 women per arm with a total of 84 subjects using a Type I error of&#xD;
      0.0501 and a power of 80% by a two-sided test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization and intervention&#xD;
&#xD;
      Questionnaire The questionnaire consists of twenty-one questions assessing the knowledge,&#xD;
      preferences, and attitude towards prenatal testing in the first trimester of pregnancy. The&#xD;
      questionnaire will be divided into two parts. The first fourteen questions consist of&#xD;
      demographic characteristics and obstetrics history, such as age, ethnicity, study level,&#xD;
      marital status, religion, salary, employment, parity, previous miscarriages, previous&#xD;
      terminations of pregnancy, previous congenital defects, pregnancy search time in months, type&#xD;
      of conception, and who had provided any type of previous information about prenatal&#xD;
      screening/testing. Women will be asked to select only one option for each question. All&#xD;
      questions will have the possibility to answer as &quot;Prefer not to answer&quot;. The second part of&#xD;
      the questionnaire will assess the preferences and attitudes towards prenatal testing; women&#xD;
      will be asked to choose only one option for each question. The following questions will be&#xD;
      included in the second part of the questionnaire: What influences the participants the most&#xD;
      about prenatal testing? Who influenced the participants the most about prenatal testing?&#xD;
      Would the participants like to choose their prenatal test? Which prenatal test would the&#xD;
      participants choose? What is the participants' opinion about termination? All questions&#xD;
      include an &quot;I don't know answer&quot;. The two final questions will ask the following, &quot;What&#xD;
      information regarding the results of prenatal testing is more important for the&#xD;
      participants?&quot; and &quot;What is most important for the participants about prenatal testing?&quot;.&#xD;
      Women will be asked to score the first question from 1 to 5, meaning 1 the least important&#xD;
      and 5 the most important, and from 1 to 6 in the same manner for the second question. These&#xD;
      two questions will be assessed as means, where the question with the highest mean represents&#xD;
      what is most important for the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The analysis will be conducted by intention-to-treat. Missing data for the main outcome will&#xD;
      be handled by complete-data analysis because women without an answer on the main outcome will&#xD;
      be excluded. All analyses will be divided by groups (control vs experimental group).&#xD;
      Continuous data will be assessed for normality using the Kolmogorov-Smirnoff test. Normally&#xD;
      distributed variables will be compared using t-test and expressed as mean and standard&#xD;
      deviation (SD), while not normally distributed variables will be analyzed using the&#xD;
      Mann-Whitney-U test and expressed as medians and interquartile range (IQR). Quantitative&#xD;
      variables will be compared using X2 test and expressed as numbers (n) and proportions (%).&#xD;
      For the main outcome, preferences for prenatal testing among groups will be analyzed using&#xD;
      absolute risk increase defined as the incidence of the outcome in the experimental group&#xD;
      minus the incidence in the control group. The absolute risk increase will be depicted in a&#xD;
      forest plot. A multivariate logistic regression will be performed to determine the Odds for&#xD;
      choosing invasive testing adjusting by demographic characteristics and previous counseling.&#xD;
      Data will be analyzed using STATA v.15.3 for Mac (Texas College Station) and GraphPad Prism&#xD;
      version 8.1.2 for Mac, GraphPad Software, San Diego, California USA, www.graphpad.com.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>Participants will be randomized using an interactive Web-response system assigning patients in a 1:1 ratio to receive the extra counseling before first trimester assessment (intervention group) or nothing (control group). The allocation will be performed by the study manager. The maternal-fetal medicine specialist will be in charge of the participant's enrolment and will also perform the intervention to the corresponding randomized group.&#xD;
This is an open-label study which means that the specialist and women will be aware of the allocation and intervention every time.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>The primary outcome of the study is the desire to choose an invasive diagnostic testing as the first option of screening for chromosomal abnormalities.&#xD;
This will be measured in the questionnaire by asking the question: which prenatal test would you choose if given the opportunity? Women will be asked to choose only one answer between first trimester combined test, cell-free DNA, invasive testing in a yes/no format. The main outcome will be analized as the absolute risk increase along with tis 95% confidence interval.</description>
