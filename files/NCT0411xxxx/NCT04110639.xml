  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hip fractures are a common entity in the realm of orthopedic trauma care and make up about&#xD;
      20% of the average workload of a trauma center. The lifetime risk of sustaining a hip&#xD;
      fracture is significant; in women the range is 40-50% and among men it is 13-22%. Among all&#xD;
      hip fractures, intracapsular femoral neck fractures (FNF) account for approximately 50% and&#xD;
      are a significant undertaking for both the patient and treating physician. As the average age&#xD;
      of the general population increases, the incidence of FNF in the worldwide population is&#xD;
      likewise expected to rise (1.66 million observed in 1990 and 6.26 million projected 2050)&#xD;
      with profound societal and economic impact.1&#xD;
&#xD;
      Operative indications and the methodology of surgical intervention in cases of femoral neck&#xD;
      fractures are well established. Generally speaking, treatment options can be divided in two&#xD;
      groups: reduction with internal fixation or arthroplasty. This treatment decision depends on&#xD;
      patient factors and fracture characteristics. Within the realm of internal fixation, advances&#xD;
      in the quality of modern implants have yielded largely good surgical outcomes. However,&#xD;
      internal fixation of femoral neck fractures is not without complications. Osteonecrosis of&#xD;
      the femoral head (ONFH) and nonunion are the major causes of morbidity and economic burden.2&#xD;
      The rate of ONFH in a recent meta-analysis was 0-22% (mean 6.9%) with a trend towards higher&#xD;
      rates in women, patients less than 60 years of age, and those treated with cannulated screw&#xD;
      fixation.1,3,4 Identifying measures to minimize the risk of osteonecrosis and nonunion would&#xD;
      be beneficial to patient outcomes. Prior studies have noted correlations between residual&#xD;
      displacement of the femoral head or varus malreduction with fixation failure (13-fold&#xD;
      increase).1,5 In both cases, it is suspected that failure to restore normal anatomy of the&#xD;
      femoral head and neck compromises the biomechanical alignment of the hip, and most&#xD;
      importantly, its blood flow.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To date, there has not been a well-described intra-operative method to assess femoral head&#xD;
      perfusion in adults, or to correlate these finding with late complications such as&#xD;
      osteonecrosis. The diagnosis of osteonecrosis is typically made late in the patient's&#xD;
      post-operative course when it becomes apparent on radiographs. Some investigators have&#xD;
      studied the utility of select imaging studies at predicting femoral head perfusion and found&#xD;
      single photon-emission computerized tomography (CT) to be accurate, but not easily available&#xD;
      in all centers.6 MRI is felt to be superior to radiographs for early detection, but still not&#xD;
      reliable in the first few weeks after injury.7 While the use of post-operative MRI and CT to&#xD;
      elucidate femoral head perfusion has been investigated, neither can provide a real-time,&#xD;
      intra-operative, measure of blood flow to the femoral head. If a real-time perfusion&#xD;
      assessment tool was available, surgeons could determine the necessity for, and adequacy of,&#xD;
      intraoperative reduction. Lack of perfusion could alter a surgeon's operative plan and might&#xD;
      prompt an attempt at improving the reduction or a change in surgical management.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this prospective study is to establish an intra-operative technique to monitor&#xD;
      femoral head blood flow in patients with femoral neck fractures. The investigators'&#xD;
      hypothesis is that by utilizing an intracranial pressure (ICP) monitor to detect the presence&#xD;
      or absence of waveforms in the femoral head, investigators could reliably assess the&#xD;
      perfusion levels within the femoral head and possibly reduce the incidence of osteonecrosis.&#xD;
      Primary outcomes will be osteonecrosis and fracture union. The implications of this study may&#xD;
      lead to changes in post-operative management, the intra-operative surgical plan if little to&#xD;
      no epiphyseal perfusion is present and potentially new treatments for FNF patients to avoid&#xD;
      the dreaded complication of osteonecrosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intracranial pressure monitor will be utilized during the standard operative fixation of&#xD;
      displaced and non-displaced FNF patients. This will allow a real-time assessment of femoral&#xD;
      head perfusion pressure following reduction and fixation of these fractures. Correlations&#xD;
      will be made to patients' blood pressure, demographic data, and injury characteristics. The&#xD;
      monitor uses a sterile transducer that contains a pressure-monitoring catheter. This produces&#xD;
      an artifact free, high fidelity waveform tracing without the need for a &quot;fluid-filled&quot;&#xD;
      system. In the proposed application, the monitor would quantify perfusion pressure in the&#xD;
      femoral head rather than cerebral tissue pressure. Following the investigators' protocol, the&#xD;
      ICP monitor will be inserted through the cannulated screw used for fracture fixation and then&#xD;
      removed after the measurement has been recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dr. Tim Schrader, the principal investigator, currently utilizes this ICP monitor as standard&#xD;
      of care for all patients being treated for unstable slipped capital femoral epiphysis, a&#xD;
      pediatric condition of the hip that similarly has an associated risk of osteonecrosis. He has&#xD;
      demonstrated that the presence of femoral head perfusion as detected by a waveform on&#xD;
      intra-osseous placed ICP monitor has been associated with the absence of osteonecrosis&#xD;
      post-operatively.8&#xD;
