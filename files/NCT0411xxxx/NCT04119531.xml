    <textblock>
      18-55 years old 100 patients, who are planned to undergo for planned ureteroscopy will be&#xD;
      participated in the study. In the preoperative room patients will be asked to participate to&#xD;
      the study. If they accept 4 item Jenkins-Sleep Questionaire will be asked to them.Patients&#xD;
      will be divided to two groups , with or without insomnia according to their answers to the&#xD;
      questionaire. General anesthesia will be performed to all patients. At the end of operation&#xD;
      anesthesia time,operation time, time of eye opening, time of transfer to the recovery room&#xD;
      will be recorded in the operating room. Pain scores and recovery scores will be evaluated in&#xD;
      the recovery room.&#xD;

      18-55 years old 100 patients with American Society of Anesthesiology (ASA) physical status&#xD;
      I-II,who are planned to undergo for elective ureteroscopy will be participated in this&#xD;
      study.In the preoperative room patients will be asked to participate to the study and will be&#xD;
      asked to answer the 4-item Jenkins-Sleep Questionaire.If they accept to participate, written&#xD;
      informed consent will be taken from the patients. According to their answers to the&#xD;
      questionaire , patients will be divided into two groups :those with or without&#xD;
      insomnia.General anesthesia will be performed to all patients. After anesthesia induction&#xD;
      with propofol 2mg/kg and rocuronium 0.6 mg/kg, patients will be ıntubated and mechanically&#xD;
      ventilated. Maintenance of anesthesia will be achieved with 4-6 % desflurane in nitrous&#xD;
      oxide/ oxygen (50%/50%) concentrations with the flow 5L/min. Tramadol 1 mg/kg and&#xD;
      metoclopramid 1 ampul will be administered intravenously after intubation. Hemodynamic&#xD;
      parameters( systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, heart rate and peripheral&#xD;
      oxygen saturation), end tidal carbon dioxide values, the concentrations of inspired and&#xD;
      exhaled desflurane will be recorded on the surgery start time and on the 5th,&#xD;
      15th,25th,35th,45th,60 th minutes of surgery. At the end of operation ,neuromuscular blockage&#xD;
      will be reversed with neostigmine (0,05 mg/kg)and atropine sulphate 0,015 mg/kg i.v.&#xD;
      Anesthesia time, surgery time, time of eye opening,time of transfer to the recovery room will&#xD;
      be recorded in the operating room. In the recovery room pain score will be evaluated with&#xD;
      Visual Analogue Scale. Modified Aldrete Recovery Score will be used for evaluating recovery.&#xD;
