  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will investigate the safety and efficacy of TIL therapy in patients with&#xD;
      metastatic TNBC who have progressed on at least one and no more than three prior systemic&#xD;
      anticancer therapies.&#xD;

      The primary aims of the study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the efficacy of autologous LN-145 as a single therapy in Metastatic Triple&#xD;
           Negative Breast Cancer (TNBC) patients by determining the objective response rate (ORR),&#xD;
           using the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1, as assessed by the&#xD;
           Investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To characterize the safety profile of tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) as a single&#xD;
           therapy in Metastatic Triple Negative Breast Cancer patients as measured by the&#xD;
           incidence of Grade ≥ 3 treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary aims of the study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
      • To further evaluate the efficacy of autologous LN-145 as a single therapy in Metastatic&#xD;
      Triple Negative Breast Cancer patients using complete response duration of response (DOR),&#xD;
      disease control rate (DCR), and progression-free survival (PFS), using RECIST 1.1, as&#xD;
      assessed by the Investigator, overall survival (OS) and (CR) rate.&#xD;
