  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this proposal is to evaluate whether mandibular advancement device (MAD) is&#xD;
      non-inferior to continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) in the treatment of obstructive&#xD;
      sleep apnea (OSA) and blood pressure reduction. OSA and hypertension are highly prevalent&#xD;
      disorders with profound impacts on health. Apart from improving quality of-life, an effective&#xD;
      OSA treatment could improve cardiovascular risk partly through blood pressure reduction,&#xD;
      particularly in patients with high cardiovascular risk in whom blood pressure control is&#xD;
      often suboptimal. Although CPAP is useful, the high non-acceptance and non-adherence preclude&#xD;
      its widespread use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      East Asians have a restrictive craniofacial phenotype that predisposes them to OSA and the&#xD;
      associated cardiovascular stress. CPAP, while considered the first-line therapy for OSA, has&#xD;
      failed to improve cardiovascular outcomes in randomized trials till date because it is poorly&#xD;
      tolerated. MADs are oral appliances that correct the restrictive craniofacial phenotype&#xD;
      present in East Asians by protruding the lower jaw to reduce upper airway collapsibility.&#xD;
      MADs are better tolerated than CPAP, and this may be an important determinant of the overall&#xD;
      effectiveness in treating OSA, and thus ameliorating the downstream adverse health outcomes.&#xD;
      We hypothesize that MADs are non-inferior to CPAP in treating OSA and reducing cardiovascular&#xD;
      risk by blood pressure reduction in East Asians.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will recruit East Asian subjects with hypertension and high cardiovascular risk for&#xD;
      polysomnography. Patients diagnosed with OSA (n=220) will be randomized to MAD or CPAP groups&#xD;
      in a 1:1 ratio for a treatment duration of 6 months. The primary endpoint is the 24-hour mean&#xD;
      blood pressure as determined by ambulatory monitoring. The secondary endpoints include&#xD;
      sleep-time systolic BP, target blood pressure, cardiovascular biomarkers, and myocardial&#xD;
      remodeling. Association between OSA and silent paroxysmal atrial fibrillation will also be&#xD;
      determined. If MADs are shown to be effective, the next step is to evaluate our novel device-&#xD;
      drug-eluting MAD that the team is developing.&#xD;

    <description>Mandibular advancement device (MAD) has been a novel method in the management of snoring and OSA. For mild to moderate sleep apnea, MADs have been a boon. A guideline published by American Academy of Sleep Medicine stated that MAD was indicated as first-line therapy for mild OSA and a second-line therapy for moderate to severe OSA</description>
