  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of the study is to determine how different types of Regional Anesthesia (nerve&#xD;
      blocks) can be helpful to patients with lower extremity trauma who develop compartment&#xD;
      syndrome (an increased pressure in the fascial compartments) which can occur after injury to&#xD;
      the leg.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a prospective, randomized study in healthy volunteers, who will undergo testing of&#xD;
      the leg using a cuff inflation system, involving quantitative sensory testing (QST),&#xD;
      questionnaire completion, with ultrasound scanning and nerve blocks in a supervised,&#xD;
      monitored setting (BWH Clinical Investigation Center).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aims&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Determine the effect of adductor canal-saphenous nerve block (ACB) and popliteal-fossa&#xD;
           nerve block (SNB-PF) vs no block on pressure and ischemic pain in a model of compartment&#xD;
           syndrome.&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Hypothesis: There will be minimal or no change in pressure pain threshold and&#xD;
                tolerance and pain ratings with ACB alone&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Hypothesis: There will be an increase in pressure pain threshold and tolerance and&#xD;
                decrease in pain ratings with ACB plus popliteal-fossa nerve block (SNB-PF),&#xD;
                compared to no block&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Determine the concentration dependence of SNB-PF effect on pressure and ischemic pain by&#xD;
           comparing increasing doses of local anesthetic.&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Hypothesis: There will be a greater increase in pressure pain threshold and&#xD;
                tolerance and great decrease in pain ratings with 1.5% mepivacaine than with 0.375%&#xD;
                mepivacaine.&#xD;

      &quot;Interested in participating in Compartment Syndrome Study&quot;&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening and Enrollment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy volunteers will be recruited, and all interested individuals will be invited to&#xD;
      contact study staff to hear more about the study requirements and undergo a brief phone&#xD;
      screen to determine eligibility. After their initial phone screen with study staff,&#xD;
      interested subjects meeting eligibility requirements will be provided with an electronic copy&#xD;
      of the consent form, perform a video consent, and schedule a study visit, to be conducted in&#xD;
      the Clinical Investigation Center at Brigham and Women's Hospital. A 5 hour, 1 office visit&#xD;
      is required.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All subjects will also undergo a survey-based COVID screen within 24 hours prior to the&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study day:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Immediately upon arrival for their study appointment, the physician investigator will go&#xD;
      through the consent form in detail with each potential participant, and they will also be&#xD;
      given a chance to read it thoroughly and have questions answered. Special care will be taken&#xD;
      during the consent process to ensure subjects are fully competent and understand the nature&#xD;
      of the questionnaires and testing procedures, including a brief demonstration of the devices&#xD;
      and testing done. If agreeable to the study procedures after having questions answered,&#xD;
      participants will provide informed consent. Each participant will be assigned a random ID&#xD;
      number, and data will be collected, entered, and analyzed by ID number only. The subject's&#xD;
      status as a patient will be unaffected by his/her decision to participate. If subject decides&#xD;
      against participation at this point, they will be reimbursed for their time ($20).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Enrolled participants will complete basic deidentified demographic, clinical, psychosocial,&#xD;
      and pain questionnaires. Brief validated questionnaires will include the PROMIS anxiety,&#xD;
      depression, and sleep disturbance short forms, Pain Catastrophizing Scale (PCS), situational&#xD;
      pain catastrophizing scale (sPCS), Brief Symptom Index, Fibromyalgianess scale, Brief Pain&#xD;
      Inventory, Positive and Negative Affect Schedule, and pain coping strategies questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completing questionnaires, subjects will lie on a stretcher, with head of bed elevated&#xD;
      to 30-45 degree angle according to comfort, with legs and feet exposed for testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      QST testing Pressure pain threshold: Pressure algometry is the most commonly used test for&#xD;
      static mechanical pressure sensation in the skin and in deep tissues. Pressure algometers&#xD;
      deliver a firm and quantifiable pressure through a flat base applied to the skin. The&#xD;
      electronic pressure algometer that we will use (Wagner Instruments) is a hand-held algometer&#xD;
      utilizing a pressure-sensitive strain gauge, covered by a 0.5 cm2 circular probe. The probe&#xD;
      is covered with a soft polypropylene disk, to avoid injury to the skin. The pressure applied&#xD;
      through the probe is transduced, amplified, and converted to electrical reading on a digital&#xD;
      display. The pressure will be slowly increased (1 lb/s) and the participant will be asked to&#xD;
      note when they first feel pain and when they want the pressure to stop , which will be&#xD;
      recorded as the pressure pain threshold and tolerance, respectively.120 This process will be&#xD;
      repeated on the trapezius and the forearm, alternating between sides of the body with 20&#xD;
      seconds between measurements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pin Prick: This tests the detection and intensity of sharp type pain. In addition, it is&#xD;
      often used as a modality to test temporal summation of pain with repeated stimuli. The&#xD;
      conductor of the test will touch the participant on the finger with weighted mechanical&#xD;
      probes in ascending order (64 mN, 128 mN, 256 mN, 512 mN), making sure to keep the probe&#xD;
      perpendicular to the skin, and allowing the full weight to be resting on this point (i.e. the&#xD;
      weight moves within the barrel), but without touching the barrel/cylinder itself to the skin.&#xD;
      The participant will be instructed to rate the pain (0-10) of each stimulation. The conductor&#xD;
      will make note of the lowest weight pin prick the participant indicated caused a 1-3 out of&#xD;
      10 pain. Then the conductor will perform the test of temporal summation to repeated punctate&#xD;
      stimuli, which is considered an index of central pain-faciliatory processes. The pin prick&#xD;
      weight that the participant noted was a 1-3 out of 10 pain is applied to the skin of the&#xD;
      dorsal fingers at a frequency of 1Hz. Ten stimuli are applied, and the patient will be asked&#xD;
      to rate the sensation of pain from the fifth, and tenth stimulus, as well as 15 seconds after&#xD;
      the end of the stimulus train (PAS). The wind-up phenomenon occurs with progressive increase&#xD;
      evoked pain with repeated stimulation and represents an index of central sensitization.&#xD;
      Testing order will be performed on each hand, bilaterally, and on each foot.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pressure Pain Threshold Assessment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pressure pain will be assessed through response to cuff pressure algometry (CPA). Tonic,&#xD;
      deep-tissue, mechanical stimulation will be applied using a Hokanson rapid cuff inflator,&#xD;
      which allows specific calibrated pressures to by administered and held for defined time&#xD;
      periods. Using an adjustable cuff (similar to standard blood pressure cuff) wrapped around&#xD;
      the leg, centered around the largest diameter of the gastrocnemius muscle, pressure will be&#xD;
      increased by turning a manual dial at a rate of approximately 10-20 mmHg/second until the&#xD;
      subject first feels pressure, and thereafter at approximately 5-10 mmHg/s, at which time&#xD;
      subject will be asked to note when they first start feeling pain and then when they feel as&#xD;
      though the pain is a 4, 6, 8 and 10 out of 10 VAS score (0 = no pain, 10 = worst pain), after&#xD;
      which the cuff will be immediately deflated. Participants will be given a break. Cuff&#xD;
      pressure at each of these points will be recorded 3 times for each leg to determine baseline&#xD;
      pain thresholds.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ischemic Pain Assessment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The cuff will be re-inflated to the subject's average pressure previously determined to&#xD;
      produce 4 out of 10 pain for that leg, and held for 5 minutes. A pulse oximeter will be&#xD;
      placed on the big toe to monitor ischemia (pulse oximetry wave expected to disappear).&#xD;
      Subjects will be asked for pain score at rest every 30 seconds, and pain score on passive&#xD;
      stretch of gastrocnemius every 60 seconds. The participant will be reminded immediately&#xD;
      before cuff inflation that they may ask for the pressure cuff to be deflated at any time, in&#xD;
      which case this time will be recorded. Subjects will be asked to indicate the presence of&#xD;
      tingling (paresthesias), and will rate pain at rest 30 and 60 seconds following cuff&#xD;
      deflation (painful after sensations), as well as pain with passive stretch of gastrocnemius&#xD;
      at 60 seconds after cuff deflation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There will be a 1 minute break, then the cuff pressure will be inflated to a pressure&#xD;
      corresponding to the next pain level as initially identified on the averaged baseline testing&#xD;
      (ex: if pressure 4/10 was 100 mmHg and 6/10 was 150 mmHg, cuff pressure will first be held at&#xD;
      100 mmHg and held for 5 minutes, followed by a 1 minute break, and then reinflated at 150&#xD;
      mmHg and held for 5 minutes, followed by 1 minutes break, etc.). The above procedure will be&#xD;
      repeated for cuff pressure at 6/10, 8/10, and 10/10. This will be done first on the &quot;control&#xD;
      leg&quot; and then on the &quot;block leg&quot; prior to the nerve block placement. Subjects will be&#xD;
      reminded that they may discontinue the cuff inflation at any point, and the time of cuff&#xD;
      inflation recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV placement:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A 20 g IV will be placed prior to the start of any nerve block procedure. Site of IV&#xD;
      placement will be cleaned with alcohol swab and initially anesthetized with 1% lidocaine&#xD;
      administered through a small needle to allow greater comfort with IV placement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nerve Blocks:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Saphenous Nerve Block (ACB):&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will lie supine with block leg slightly abducted. Standard monitors will be applied&#xD;
      for vital monitoring (continuous pulse oximetry, EKG, blood pressure cuff every 5 minutes),&#xD;
      and this monitoring continued until 20 minutes after block completion. Using sterile&#xD;
      technique (cleaning of skin with chloroprep, sterile gloves, mask, sterile cap, sterile&#xD;
      needle, sterile ultrasound probe cover and sterile gel), an ultrasound-guided approach will&#xD;
      be used to identify the saphenous nerve and surrounding sonographic landmarks (sartorius&#xD;
      muscle, vastus medialis, femoral artery, femoral vein, and adductor magnus). With a small&#xD;
      needle, a small skin wheal of 1 cc of 1% lidocaine will be used to anesthetize the skin.&#xD;
      Afterwards a standard 21 g, 10 cm block needle will be inserted and directed under ultrasound&#xD;
      guidance to the saphenous nerve location. Aspiration on block syringe will be performed to&#xD;
      confirm that needle tip is not within a vascular structure to avoid intraarterial or venous&#xD;
      injection of local anesthetic. Incremental injection (5 cc at a time) of 1.5% mepivacaine&#xD;
      will follow, with a total of 10 cc (150 mg) deposited around the saphenous nerve.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Popliteal sciatic Nerve Block (SNB-PF): (for dual nerve block group only) Participant will&#xD;
      lie supine, with leg elevated to allow access to posterior leg for US scanning. Using sterile&#xD;
      technique, an ultrasound-guided approach will be used to identify the common peroneal nerve&#xD;
      and tibial nerve at the level of the popliteal fossa, and surrounding sonographic landmarks&#xD;
      (femur, popliteal artery, and popliteal vein). The common peroneal and tibial nerves will be&#xD;
      followed proximally by scanning proximally along the leg with the ultrasound until they form&#xD;
      a unitary nerve (sciatic). With a small needle, a small skin wheal of 1 cc of 1% lidocaine&#xD;
      will be used to anesthetize the skin of the lateral level at this level. Afterwards a&#xD;
      standard 21 g, 10 cm block needle will be inserted and directed under ultrasound guidance to&#xD;
      the sciatic nerve. Aspiration on block syringe will be performed to confirm that needle tip&#xD;
      is not within a vascular structure to avoid intraarterial or venous injection of local&#xD;
      anesthetic. Incremental injection (5 cc at a time) of 0.375% or 1.5% mepivacaine will follow,&#xD;
      with a total of 15 cc (56.25 mg or 225 mg) deposited around the sciatic nerve.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expected timeline Pressure pain threshold assessment will take approximately 3 minutes and&#xD;
      Ischemic pain assessment approximately 30 minutes (5 minutes per inflation pressure with 1&#xD;
      minute for rest in between). Each assessment will be taken at baseline and 20 minutes after&#xD;
      nerve block completion to allow full effect. Ultrasound measures of compartment pressures&#xD;
      will be assessed before, during, and after pressure and ischemic pain assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Resolution of Nerve block: Nerve blocks with mepivacaine are expected to be resolved within&#xD;
      4-6 hours, but monitoring will continue beyond this time as some normal variation in&#xD;
      resolution may occur between individuals. Subjects will only be given assistance with getting&#xD;
      off stretcher/chair if needed for 4 hours after nerve block placement. Strength testing of&#xD;
      target nerve groups in lower extremity will be confirmed before subject is allowed to walk&#xD;
      independently. Subjects gait and walking will be assessed and confirmed to be ambulating&#xD;
      safely before discharge.&#xD;
