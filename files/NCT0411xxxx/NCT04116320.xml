    <textblock>
      This study evaluates whether it is safe to Focused Ultrasound Ablation (FUSA) treatments with&#xD;
      and without PD-1 blockade and with and without imiquimod. A device called the Echopulse will&#xD;
      be used for the FUSA therapy. Patients will be assigned to 1 of 2 cohorts depending on their&#xD;
      disease and treatment status. In Cohort 1, patients will receive FUSA therapy while receiving&#xD;
      PD-1 blockade therapy as part of standard clinical care treatment. In Cohort 2, patients who&#xD;
      discontinue or are ineligible for PD-1 blockade therapy will undergo FUSA without concurrent&#xD;
      systemic therapy, with the goal of utilizing the FUSA to boost the innate immune response.&#xD;
      The optional secondary regimen will combine FUSA (+/- PD-1 blockade) with imiquimod, which is&#xD;
      a topical TLR7 agonist.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Age â‰¥18 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Advanced solid tumor with measurable disease in regional and/or distant metastases.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Subject must have failed or have contraindication to standard therapies&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. For Cohort 1, primary regimen (Regimen 1a): Patients with advanced solid malignancy&#xD;
             for which PD1 or PDL1 antibody monotherapy administered on a 3-week schedule is&#xD;
             FDA-approved for treatment, who have one or more tumor deposits that are accessible to&#xD;
             focused ultrasound treatment, and who are eligible to receive (or to continue to&#xD;
             receive) PD1 or PDL1 blockade therapy. Uveal melanoma patients are not eligible for&#xD;
             Regimen 1a.&#xD;
&#xD;
             Note: These patients may receive the primary protocol therapy (Regimen 1a) concurrent&#xD;
             with PD1/PDL1 antibody therapy even if they may be eligible for other effective&#xD;
             FDA-approved therapies in the following settings:&#xD;
&#xD;
             Patients with stable disease after 12 weeks of PD1/PDL1 therapy per RECIST criteria&#xD;
             may be eligible for Regimen 1a if their disease has remained stable on therapy and if&#xD;
             their treating physician would normally continue PD1/PDL1 therapy even if they were&#xD;
             not treated on this trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. For Cohort 1, secondary regimen (Regimen 2a): For those patients treated with primary&#xD;
             regimen 1a, select participants may be enrolled in a secondary regimen. This would&#xD;
             include participants in the following scenarios:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Stable disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Response in lesion treated in regimen 1, but persistent disease or progression in&#xD;
                  a separate lesion.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Initial partial response but still persistent disease at the treated lesion.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Initial response followed by progression at treated lesion or separate site,&#xD;
                  after discontinuation of PD-1/PD-L1 antibody. If there is a response and then&#xD;
                  progression at the site treated in Regimen 1 and the residual tumor meets&#xD;
                  inclusion criteria, this lesion may be re-treated on the secondary regimen. For&#xD;
                  participants who progress at a site unique from the treated lesion, they may&#xD;
                  enroll in Regimen 2 and have this new lesion treated, as long as they meet all&#xD;
                  inclusion criteria requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
             The patient must have a treatable tumor deposit in the dermis. The lesion to be FUSA&#xD;
             treated in regimen 2 does not need to be the same lesion targeted in regimen 1. The&#xD;
             patient must remain eligible for PD1/PDL1 Ab therapy. The length between the FUSA&#xD;
             treatments in primary regimen and secondary regimen should be no less than 6 weeks.&#xD;
             Patients who experienced an unanticipated device effect in the primary regimen are not&#xD;
             eligible for the secondary regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. For Cohort 2, primary regimen (Regimen 1b): The following patient subsets would be&#xD;
             eligible for the Cohort 2 primary regimen, as long as they have failed (progressed or&#xD;
             not tolerated) or are not eligible for all effective available approved therapies&#xD;
             known to confer clinical benefit:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Patients with advanced solid malignancy for which PD1 or PDL1 blockade is not&#xD;
                  FDA-approved.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Patients with metastatic uveal melanoma&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Patients with advanced solid malignancies for which PD1 or PDL1 blockade is FDA&#xD;
                  approved but who are not eligible to receive that therapy because of prior&#xD;
                  failure, toxicity, baseline autoimmune disease, or frailty.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Patients who previously responded to PD1/PDL1 therapy but then progressed, if&#xD;
                  there are no other systemic therapies available to them.&#xD;
&#xD;
             Patients who were previously undergoing PD-1 blockade therapy must not have received a&#xD;
             dose within 4 weeks prior to FUSA treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. For Cohort 2, secondary regimen (Regimen 2b): For those patients treated with primary&#xD;
             regimen 1a or 1b, select participants may be enrolled in a secondary regimen. This&#xD;
             would include participants in the following scenarios:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Stable disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Response in lesion treated in regimen 1, but persistent disease or progression in&#xD;
                  a separate lesion.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Initial partial response but still persistent disease at the treated lesion.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Initial response followed by progression at the treated lesion or a separate site&#xD;
                  after discontinuation of PD-1/PD-L1 antibody. If there is a response and then&#xD;
                  progression at the site treated in Regimen 1 and the residual tumor meets&#xD;
                  inclusion criteria, this lesion may be re-treated on the secondary regimen. For&#xD;
                  participants who progress at a site unique from the treated lesion, they may&#xD;
                  enroll in Regimen 2 and have this new lesion treated, as long as they meet all&#xD;
                  inclusion criteria requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
             Patients enrolling to Regimen 2b must have a treatable tumor deposit in the dermis.&#xD;
             The lesion to be FUSA treated in regimen 2 does not need to be the same lesion&#xD;
             targeted in regimen 1. Crossover from primary regimen 1a is allowed if the patient is&#xD;
             no longer eligible for continued PD1/PDL1 Ab therapy (e.g. due to autoimmune&#xD;
             toxicity), and if there is no other effective systemic therapy option. The length&#xD;
             between the FUSA treatments in regimen 1 and regimen 2 should be no less than 6 weeks.&#xD;
             Patients who experienced an unanticipated device effect in the primary regimen are not&#xD;
             eligible for the secondary regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. One or more dermal, subcutaneous or nodal metastases from an advanced solid tumor. The&#xD;
             metastases need to be accessible for FUSA and for biopsy.&#xD;
&#xD;
             For FUSA:&#xD;
&#xD;
             The targeted lesion(s) must be visible by ultrasound imaging and meet the following&#xD;
             criteria. Brain lesions may not be targeted for treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Approximately 1 cm (or more) diameter of treatable tumor volume for lesions to be&#xD;
                  treated with FUSA.&#xD;
&#xD;

                  from the skin surface and less than or equal to 23 mm from the skin surface.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  The target treatment area must be at a safe distance from all critical&#xD;
                  structures, including but not limited to ribs or other bony structures, vital&#xD;
                  organs, named blood vessels or nerves.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  The critical structures, with the exception of the skin, will not be in the&#xD;
                  pre-focal ultrasound path.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  The anterior-posterior dimension of the treatment area by US should be no less&#xD;
                  than 9mm.&#xD;
&#xD;
             For Biopsies:&#xD;
&#xD;
             Biopsies may be completed with or without image guidance.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Lesions that have been selected for focused ultrasound or lesions that have been&#xD;
             selected for biopsies as untreated controls may have been previously radiated&#xD;
             provided:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  The tumor site that was previously radiated has progressed.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  A baseline biopsy of the tumor site is obtained following progression and prior&#xD;
