      All pregnant women prenatally being followed up or admitted at Rambam HealthCare Campus,&#xD;
      Haifa, Israel are potential participants in the study. If a patient is agreeable, the&#xD;
      nurse/physician/research coordinator will obtain informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once informed consent is obtained, the patient can be swabbed for GBS. The swabs will be&#xD;
      obtained at the routine follow-up at the clinic at 30, 32 and 35 weeks' gestation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If a patient is found to have a positive GBS culture at 35 weeks, she will receive antibiotic&#xD;
      treatment during labour according to the protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      GBS swabs taken at delivery will be compared to previous swabs taken at an earlier&#xD;
      gestational age in order to evaluate sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative&#xD;
      predictive values of GBS swabs at each week of gestation and to determine the value of our&#xD;
      primary hypothesis.&#xD;

      1. All pregnant women prenatally being followed up or admitted at Rambam HealthCare Campus,&#xD;
           Haifa, Israel are potential participants in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Most high-risk pregnant women have their routine follow ups every two weeks or less from&#xD;
           the beginning of the third trimester (between 28 and 32 weeks' gestation).&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. The nurse/physician/research coordinator in the clinic will discuss the trial with those&#xD;
           women. If a patient is agreeable, the nurse/physician/research coordinator will obtain&#xD;
           informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Once informed consent is obtained, the patient can be swabbed for GBS.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. The swabs will be obtained at the routine follow-up at the clinic at 30, 32 and 35&#xD;
           weeks' gestation. Then, they will be handed to the nurse/physician/research coordinator&#xD;
           and transferred to the lab for analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Swabs for GBS culture should be obtained, ideally before digital examination or use of&#xD;
           lubricants, from both the lower vagina (vaginal introitus) and rectum (insert swab&#xD;
           through the anal sphincter) to achieve maximum sensitivity. Either two swabs (one for&#xD;
           each site) or a single swab can be used; one swab is more cost saving. The swabs will be&#xD;
           obtained by the patient herself after appropriate instruction as studies have shown&#xD;
           equivalent sensitivity between the healthcare provider and the patient herself20.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. The swabs should be placed promptly into non-nutrient transport media (eg, Amies or&#xD;
           Stuart's without charcoal) and transported at room temperature (in temperate climates)&#xD;
           or refrigerated. The swabs are then transferred to a selective enrichment broth at a&#xD;
           laboratory experienced in the isolation of GBS, incubated overnight at 37ÂºC, and&#xD;
           subcultured onto blood agar plates. Cultures require 24 to 48 hours to show positive&#xD;
           results. It takes 48 hours to definitively exclude GBS20.&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. The swabs will be kept for seven days, then will be removed by environmental services&#xD;
           for their discard process.&#xD;
&#xD;
        9. A log of all patients who meet all inclusion criteria and agreed to participate in the&#xD;
           trial will be maintained, recording the date and gestational age. GBS swab results will&#xD;
           also be recorded. We will only reveal the results from the 35 weeks' screening to the&#xD;
           main care provider of the patient as part of the common practice. We will not provide&#xD;
           the other screening results, neither to the patient nor to their physician.&#xD;
&#xD;
       10. If a patient is found to have a positive GBS culture at 35 weeks, she will receive&#xD;
           antibiotic treatment during labour according to the protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
       11. GBS swabs taken at delivery will be compared to previous swabs taken at an earlier&#xD;
           gestational age in order to evaluate sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative&#xD;
           predictive values of GBS swabs at each week of gestation and to determine the value of&#xD;
           our primary hypothesis.&#xD;
