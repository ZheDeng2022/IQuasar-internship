  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC) has been routinely performed under general anesthesia&#xD;
      despite the several disadvantages of general anesthesia compared to regional anesthesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are multiple reports that have been published regarding the feasibility of spinal&#xD;
      anesthesia for LC associated with many problems such as referred shoulder pain secondary to&#xD;
      intra-abdominal pneumoperitoneum; patient anxiety, pain, and discomfort; and inadequate&#xD;
      sedation.The aim of our study is to prospectively observe the feasibility of using&#xD;
      intravenous dexmedetomidine to abolish patient discomfort and shoulder pain, thus making the&#xD;
      patient more comfortable without causing excessive sedation and respiratory depression.&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, randomized double blinded control study which will be conducted in&#xD;
      department of anesthesia and surgical Intensive care unit at Theodor Bilharz Research&#xD;
      Institute after approval by research ethics committee and patient informed consent. 40&#xD;
      patients will be enrolled in the study and divided into two groups 20 patients each ; either&#xD;
      (Dexa group (D) or Control group (C).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anesthesia Technique:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A preoperative assessment, including a history, physical examination, review of laboratory&#xD;
      data, and assignment of ASA classification will be performed on all patients prior to the&#xD;
      procedure. Anesthesia and procedural consent will be obtained.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After premedication with i.v. midazolam 2 mg , patients will be transferred to the operating&#xD;
      theatre. Ringer's solution 500 ml will be given over 15 min, and patients will be&#xD;
      premedicated with intravenous ondensetron 4 mg and intravenous atropine 0.2 mg.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IN DEXA GROUP:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Injection dexmedetomidine 1 mcg /kg will be infused over a period of ten minutes then Spinal&#xD;
      anaesthesia will be performed through the L3-4 interspace in the sitting position. After&#xD;
      dural puncture with a 25 G Quincke needle, 3.5 ml of hyperbaric bupivacaine 0.5% solution&#xD;
      with fentanyl 20 μg will be injected intrathecally. Than manintance dose of dexmedetomidine&#xD;
      will be titrated from (0.2- 0.6 mcg /kg/ min) according to the patient discomfort.In CONTROL&#xD;
      GROUP:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Normal Saline as a placebo will be infused over a period of ten minutes then spinal&#xD;
      anaesthesia will be performed through the L3-4 interspace in the sitting position. After&#xD;
      dural puncture with a 25 G Quincke needle, 3.5 ml of hyperbaric bupivacaine 0.5% solution&#xD;
      with fentanyl 20 μg will be injected intrathecally. Then the placebo will be titrated&#xD;
      according to patient discomfort.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In BOTH GROUPS:&#xD;
&#xD;
      After turning the patient supine, level of sensory block will be assessed by the pinprick&#xD;
      test using a 24-gauge hypodermic needle, while the motor block level will be assessed by the&#xD;
      modified Bromage scale (0 = no paralysis; 1 = unable to raise extended leg; 2 = unable to&#xD;
      flex knee; 3 = unable to flex ankle) and recorded 10 min after placement in the supine&#xD;
      position. Insufflation of gas will be done at the rate of 1.5 liters/min and the maximum&#xD;
      abdominal pressure will be kept at 12 mmHg. Supplementary oxygen at 4 liters/min will be&#xD;
      given with face mask.Heart rate (HR), non-invasive mean blood pressure (MBP), and respiratory&#xD;
      rate will be monitored preoperatively, during dexmedetomidine infusion, after completion of&#xD;
      infusion i.e. before spinal anaesthesia, after spinal anaesthesia, during creation of&#xD;
      pneumoperitoneum, thereafter every 10 minutes, after desufflation and on admission to Post&#xD;
      Anaesthesia Care Unit (PACU) If the systolic arterial pressure decreased to below 90 mm Hg or&#xD;
      if mean arterial pressure decreased (MAP) 20% from baseline, ephedrine bolous will be given&#xD;
      i.v. If heart rate decreased to, 45 beats min, i.v. atropine 0.5 mg will be administered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Discomfort and shoulder pain will be assessed either by verbal complaint by the patient or by&#xD;
      facial and body expression. Supplemental doses of fentanyl 25 μg were given if the patient is&#xD;
      discomfort or in pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Any patient shall be converted to general anesthesia at any time intraoperatively due to&#xD;
      persistent pain or discomfort despite administration of intravenous analgesics or sedatives&#xD;
      or surgical procedure related indication.&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
       12. Conversion to general anesthesia&#xD;
&#xD;
       13. The severity of pain will be graded as nil, mild, moderate and severe.&#xD;
&#xD;
       14. Sedation level will be evaluated according to a four-point rating scale. 1, Patient&#xD;
           fully awake; 2, patient somnolent but responds to verbal commands; 3, patient somnolent&#xD;
           but responds to tactile stimuli; 4, patient asleep but responds to pain&#xD;
&#xD;
       15. The overall degree of patient satisfaction will be assessed using a three-point scale&#xD;
           (good, moderate, and bad) on the first postoperative day.&#xD;
&#xD;
       16. Time of complete regression of spinal anaesthesia,&#xD;
&#xD;
       17. Post-operative complications: Nausea and Vomiting (PONV), Urine retention and Postdural&#xD;
           puncture headache.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis Statistical analysis will be per-formed using the GraphPadInStat&#xD;
      software package (GraphPad, San Diego, CA).The categorical factors are represented by the&#xD;
      number and frequency (%) of cases. The continuous variables will represented by measures of&#xD;
      central frequency and standard error. The statistical analysis was done by using unpaired&#xD;
      t-test and Chi-square. p&lt; 0.05 was considered statistically significant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is fourty patients will be prospectively enrolled for each study of patients who had&#xD;
      been diagnosed to be able to reject the null hypothesis that the population means of the&#xD;
      groups are equal with Power calculations suggested that a minimum of 16 subjects per group&#xD;
      was required to detect 10% difference in arterial pressure between groups (taking type I or α&#xD;
      error of 5%, type II or β error of 20% and Standard Deviation=10). To be on a safer side, 20&#xD;
      patients were included in each group (n=20).&#xD;
