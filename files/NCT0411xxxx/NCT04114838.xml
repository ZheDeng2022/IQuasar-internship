  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Peripheral Arterial Occlusive Disease is associated with a high risk of cardiovascular&#xD;
      events. The critical ischemia stage represents the most severe stage of Peripheral Arterial&#xD;
      Occlusive Disease, associated with decubitus pain and / or foot ulceration. The severity of&#xD;
      this arterial involvement involves functional prognosis of the lower limb with a high risk of&#xD;
      amputation, and the vital prognosis of the patient. In these patients, the rate of amputation&#xD;
      and mortality at 1 year can reach 20%. Therefore, the goal of management in a&#xD;
      multidisciplinary setting is limb salvage and improvement of the patient's vital prognosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the vascular medicine department, the indication and modalities of the revascularization&#xD;
      procedure are discussed in a multidisciplinary consultation meeting. Surgical&#xD;
      revascularization by distal bypass requires venous material that can be used, a receiving&#xD;
      artery without diffuse lesions, in direct continuity with the arterial network of the foot,&#xD;
      and the absence of co-morbidities against general anesthesia. With the modernization and&#xD;
      development of endovascular equipment dedicated to the hamstrings, the interventional&#xD;
      radiology techniques in the management of critical ischemia allow the treatment of one or&#xD;
      more arterial axes as well as a very distal revascularization in the arteries. of the foot&#xD;
      with less morbidity-mortality compared to surgery, especially in patients the most fragile&#xD;
      patients. Since 2013, the endovascular revascularization procedures performed by the&#xD;
      interventional radiology team have been an integral part of the management of patients with&#xD;
      peripheral arterial disease of the lower limbs monitored in the vascular medicine department.&#xD;
      The hospital is therefore a privileged place to observe the long-term impact of this medical&#xD;
      care on the future of patients with different stages of severity of arterial disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this retrospective study is to evaluate the life-threatening, limb salvage&#xD;
      and associated prognostic factors in patients with Peripheral Arterial Occlusive Disease&#xD;
      supported by endovascular revascularization in the vascular medicine department of the GHPSJ.&#xD;
