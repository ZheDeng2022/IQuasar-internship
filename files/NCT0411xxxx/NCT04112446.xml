      This will be a Phase I, open-label, nonrandomized, single-dose study in healthy male&#xD;
      subjects.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Potential subjects will be screened to assess their eligibility to enter the study within 28&#xD;
      days prior to the dose administration. Subjects will be admitted into the Clinical Research&#xD;
      Unit (CRU) on Day -1 and be confined to the CRU until at least Day 8. On Day 1, subjects will&#xD;
      receive a single oral dose of [14C]-saroglitazar magnesium. Subjects will be discharged if&#xD;
      the following discharge criteria are met: plasma radioactivity levels below the limit of&#xD;
      quantitation for 2 consecutive collections and ≥ 90% mass balance recovery, or ≤ 1% of the&#xD;
      total radioactive dose is recovered in combined excreta (urine and feces) in 3 consecutive&#xD;
      24-hour periods in which both are collected. If discharge criteria are not met by Day 8,&#xD;
      subjects will remain in the CRU up to Day 12.&#xD;
