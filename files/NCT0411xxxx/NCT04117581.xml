  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Asthma is a disease characterised by chronic inflammation of the airways leading to symptoms&#xD;
      including periods of shortness of breath, wheezing and a tight chest due to airway narrowing&#xD;
      in affected patients. Current data show that one in 12 adults are currently receiving&#xD;
      treatment for asthma in the United Kingdom (UK), with the UK having some of the highest rates&#xD;
      in Europe. In the winter, 30-40% of the UK population are vitamin D deficient with some&#xD;
      asthma patients having significantly lower vitamin D levels compared to normal patients.&#xD;
      Vitamin D has been shown to be involved in the development of immune-related disorders&#xD;
      including asthma. Cross-sectional research has shown that reduced vitamin D levels are&#xD;
      associated with reduced lung function, increased airway hyper-responsiveness and reduced&#xD;
      response to glucocorticoids, suggesting vitamin D levels may also implicate asthma treatment.&#xD;
      To date, there have been three randomised controlled trials (RCT) assessing the effect of&#xD;
      vitamin D supplementation in adults with symptomatic asthma. These trials have not found a&#xD;
      significant effect of vitamin D supplementation on asthma. However, these studies relied on&#xD;
      high doses of vitamin D with long time periods between doses. There is a requirement for RCTs&#xD;
      in adults with daily supplementation of lower doses of vitamin D as it has been suggested&#xD;
      that daily supplementation is more effective for inducing non-classical actions of vitamin D.&#xD;
      However, vitamin D has been found to significantly improve airway function as measured by&#xD;
      forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) in adults supplemented with 100, 000&#xD;
      international units (IU) vitamin D intramuscularly plus 50, 000 IU oral vitamin D weekly.&#xD;
      Therefore, the effect of daily dosing on lung function also requires investigation.&#xD;
      Furthermore, these trials have focussed on clinical outcomes without investigating the&#xD;
      cellular mechanisms affording protection.&#xD;

      Recruitment and sampling strategy:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be recruited from the University of Chester (staff and students) and&#xD;
      surrounding areas, United Kingdom (UK) only. Emails, posters and social media will be used to&#xD;
      advertise the study to the target group (adults with asthma). A total of 28 adults with&#xD;
      asthma aged 18-65 years old will be included in the study based on criteria described below.&#xD;
      Eligibility will be based upon previous diagnosis of asthma by a general practitioner (GP)&#xD;
      and the number of times asthma medication is required at screening before the start of the&#xD;
      study. Participants will be required to complete a screening questionnaire which will provide&#xD;
      information about participant's health status, drugs/medication/supplement usage and sun&#xD;
      exposure. Those that have had asthma diagnosed by a GP and require their medication more than&#xD;
      twice per week will be included. All eligible participants will be briefed on the study&#xD;
      protocol before the beginning of the study, and the eligible participants will be given a&#xD;
      participant information sheet (PIS) and asked to provide written informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A 12 week, double blind, randomised controlled trial will be carried out in the clinical&#xD;
      laboratory at The University of Chester, UK. Most vitamin D and asthma studies have used&#xD;
      supplement concentrations up to 120, 000 international units (IU) with no adverse effects.&#xD;
      The European Food Standards Agency (EFSA) set a no-observed-adverse-effect-level (NOAEL) of&#xD;
      10,000IU/day (COT, 2015).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be randomly allocated to 2 groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. vitamin D group&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. placebo group&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants assigned to the vitamin D group will consume one capsule containing 5000 IU&#xD;
      vitamin D every day. Participants in the placebo group will take an identical capsule&#xD;
      containing inert filler. Participants will be asked to maintain their dietary habits and&#xD;
      physical activity. The remaining supplements will be returned at the final clinic (week 12)&#xD;
      and compliance will be estimated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be required to attend three clinics in total over a period of 12 weeks, and&#xD;
      they will be assessed at baseline (Day 0), interim (Week 6) and post-intervention (Week 12).&#xD;
      At each clinic, a 30ml blood sample will be taken and both height and weight will be&#xD;
      measured. Before the start and end of the study, participants will be required to keep a&#xD;
      3-day food diary which includes two weekdays and one weekend day to represent the habitual&#xD;
      dietary intake of the participants. At each clinic, participants will complete spirometry to&#xD;
      measure forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) and forced vital capacity (FVC) to&#xD;
      assess lung function and complete the Asthma Control Test™ (ACT) to assess asthma symptoms.&#xD;
      Blood samples will be analysed on collection for a total blood cell count. Blood samples will&#xD;
      be centrifuged to remove plasma. Plasma samples will be batch analysed at the end of the&#xD;
      intervention to assess biomarkers of vitamin D metabolism and inflammation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size and justification:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size was estimated using vitamin D supplementation data from a study in which FEV1&#xD;
      post intervention at 6 months (mean ± standard deviation (S.D)) of 51.6 ± 9.4 L (vitamin D&#xD;
      treatment group) and 31.9 ± 7.6 L (placebo group) was reported in chronic obstructive&#xD;
      pulmonary disease patients receiving 100, 000 IU vitamin D each month. With an effect size of&#xD;
      1.8493555, the total sample size required for each group in the proposed study is 9. Taking&#xD;
      into account a 20% drop out rate, and this study lasting only 12 weeks, the total sample size&#xD;
      required is 14 (power = 0.9). Therefore, the total sample size needed for the whole study is&#xD;
      28. Sample size was estimated using G Power Software.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All statistical analyses will be conducted with the International Business Machines (IBM)&#xD;
      Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) Statistic Data Editor Software (version&#xD;
      25). Assuming the data is normally distributed after performing a Shapiro Wilks normality&#xD;
      test, a mixed model analysis of variance (ANOVA) with t-test post-hoc analysis will be&#xD;
      conducted to compare the mean differences for all measured parameters between the groups at&#xD;
      the different time points. A non-parametric approach will be adopted if the data is not&#xD;
      normally distributed for all analyses. Differences will be considered significant with a p&#xD;
      value ≤ 0.05.&#xD;
