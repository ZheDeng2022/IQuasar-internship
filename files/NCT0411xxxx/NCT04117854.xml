      INTRODUCTION: Due to the low incidence of pediatric spinal cord injury (SCI) and the high&#xD;
      demand for knowledge and research, international cooperation is needed to build a solid and&#xD;
      shared understanding of the extent of the problem, and also uniformity in treatment and&#xD;
      measurement methods. The aim of the study is to map organization of care and rehabilitation&#xD;
      of children and adolescents &lt; 18 years of age with SCI, to explore qualitatively psychosocial&#xD;
      aspects of individuals and to establish use of common outcome measures in 10 rehabilitation&#xD;
      units from seven countries, cooperating within the Sunnaas International Network in&#xD;
      Rehabilitation (SIN); China, USA, Russia, Israel, Palestine, Norway and Sweden.&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHOD: In Phase I two cross-sectional studies will be conducted to set the scene for the&#xD;
      outcome studies following in Phase II (2020-2022). Phase I consists of a quantitative&#xD;
      descriptive study using a websurvey to describe and compare the systems of care and delivery&#xD;
      of inpatient rehabilitation services for pediatric SCI patients. In addition, a qualitative&#xD;
      study will explore the psychosocial aspects of living with a childhood acquired SCI. Two&#xD;
      adolescents, aged 13-17 years and at least 6 months post-acute treatment, from each unit will&#xD;
      interviewed using a semi-structured interview guide. Ethical approval has been applied for in&#xD;
      each unit, and the study is registered at ClinicalTrial-gov. A workshop for the 24 study team&#xD;
      members, where the main focus was to ensure that data collection is conducted in a good&#xD;
      manner, was held in May 2018, and data collection is expected finalized by 2020. Phase II&#xD;
      (planning stage) will consist of methodological outcome studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DISCUSSION: Phase I of the study will broaden the body of knowledge on pediatric SCI&#xD;
      internationally, thus enabling comparison, discussion and development of organizational&#xD;
      models and quality of care and rehabilitation for young persons with SCI. Phase II will&#xD;
      contribute to the use of common and reliable outcome measures for these patients.&#xD;

      INTRODUCTION Spinal cord injury (SCI) before the age of 15 is rare affecting less than 1 in&#xD;
      every 100 000 children. Over the past decade the management of pediatric spinal cord injury&#xD;
      and the long-term outcomes have received increased attention, however, most research has its&#xD;
      origin from the US. Thus, there is a need for more knowledge about occurrence and causes,&#xD;
      functional recovery, activity, participation and quality of life in children and adolescents&#xD;
      in other countries than the US. Moreover, a systematic review 2011 shows that there is&#xD;
      limited evidence about the effectiveness of interventions for the management of children with&#xD;
      SCI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Knowledge regarding organization of care and rehabilitation is incomplete and differences&#xD;
      between countries are substantial. Also, comparisons of data between countries and studies&#xD;
      have been problematic due to differences in case definitions and age limits as to what is&#xD;
      considered pediatric as opposed to adult SCI. Therefore, there is a need for international&#xD;
      collaboration and research within the area of pediatric SCI with uniformity in methodology in&#xD;
      the gathering of information and publication of the data to compare results between&#xD;
      countries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Due to the low incidence of pediatric SCI and the demand for more knowledge and research,&#xD;
      international cooperation is needed for purposes of building a solid and common understanding&#xD;
      of the scope of the problem and uniformity in management and methodology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To reach this goal in the SIN context there is a need to benchmark between units, to&#xD;
      highlight opportunities to improve systems of care and service delivery and to provide an&#xD;
      understanding of the context of the units and the similarities and differences between them&#xD;
      as this will be important for interpreting the results from subsequent phases of this project&#xD;
      when patient outcomes are reported.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exploration of psycho-social issues from the perspective of the affected young persons and&#xD;
      their families will assist targeting issues that are clinically and socially relevant for&#xD;
      future service and future research cooperation. In addition, to be able to gather information&#xD;
      to compare results between countries it is important to establish use of common outcome&#xD;
      measures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AIMS AND OBJECTIVES Long term aim and objective The long-term goal of this research project&#xD;
      is to optimize organization, care and rehabilitation in Norway and cooperating rehabilitation&#xD;
      units internationally, to increase the awareness of subjective perceptions and psychosocial&#xD;
      aspect of young persons with spinal cord injury, and to establish the use of outcome measures&#xD;
      in local languages. Participants will be recruited from the rehabilitation hospitals&#xD;
      cooperating within the Sunnaas International Network for Rehabilitation; Norway, Sweden,&#xD;
      China, Russia, US, Israel, Palestine (SIN-units).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific aims and objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To survey the SIN units in order to describe and compare the organization and delivery&#xD;
           of inpatient rehabilitation services and systems of care for pediatric SCI patients&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To explore qualitatively psychosocial aspects of living with spinal cord injury in&#xD;
           children and adolescents in SIN units using individual, semi-structured interviews&#xD;
&#xD;
      MATERIAL AND METHODS Study design This project is a cross sectional international multicenter&#xD;
      study. A PhD-student is associated with the study (Oslo Metropolitan University/ Sunnaas&#xD;
      Rehabilitation Hospital, start September 2019).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first stage of the project (Phase I) will comprise a descriptive part (Study I, Web&#xD;
      survey) and an explorative part (Study II, semi-structured interviews) conducted in clinical&#xD;
      settings in Norway, Sweden, China, Russia, US, Israel and Palestine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment The recruitment will be done within the units cooperating in the Sunnaas&#xD;
      International Network for Rehabilitation (SIN).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The local principle investigator in each unit will be responsible for collecting data in&#xD;
      Study I and recruiting individuals to participate in Study II of the study. Potentially&#xD;
      eligible individuals with SCI will be identified from the departmental or institutional&#xD;
      database. If no suitable database is present in an investigative site, recruitment through&#xD;
      alternative databases will be explored and discussed with project collaborators.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once identified, the study coordinator and local investigator will agree participant&#xD;
      identification codes for the selected individuals. The study coordinator will allocate a&#xD;
      three letter code (the first two letters will originate from the country of the study site,&#xD;
      and the third from the name of the institution).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria´s for the target group&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Children and adolescents (&lt; 18 years)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Diagnoses: either a non-traumatic or traumatic SCI after the age of 7&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Has been discharged from initial rehabilitation for 6 months or more&#xD;
&#xD;
      General Exclusion Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
      • Diagnosis of severe neurological conditions affecting the cognition of the child or&#xD;
      adolescent (e.g. as a result of encephalocele or acquired brain injury)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants Study I (descriptive study/ web survey). Ten rehabilitation units in Norway,&#xD;
      Sweden, China, Russia, US, Israel and Palestine will be participating. The local principle&#xD;
      investigator in each unit will be responsible for data collection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study II (explorative study/semi-structured interviews). Two individuals in each of the ten&#xD;
      SIN units, fulfilling the inclusion criteria's, will be recruited. A maximum of 20 young&#xD;
      informants 13-17 years will be interviewed and constitute the study group of the&#xD;
      International qualitative study. In addition, all norwegian youth with SCI rehabilitated at&#xD;
      Sunnaas Rehabilitation Hospital fulfilling the inclusion criteria and beeing13-17 years of&#xD;
      age during the inclusion period, will be recruited and constitute the study group of the&#xD;
      Norwegian qualitative study (6-10 persons). Pilot interviews will be conducted prior to data&#xD;
      collection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection and analyzing Study I (descriptive study/ web survey) A web-survey based on&#xD;
      clinical expertise and literature review have been developed in cooperation between Dr Peter&#xD;
      W New, Spinal Rehabilitation Service, Caulfield Hospital, Australia and Norwegian clinicians&#xD;
      and researchers with experience in pediatric SCI. The survey is a development and an adapted&#xD;
      version of the survey used to conduct an international comparison of the organization of&#xD;
      rehabilitation services and systems of care for adult patients with non-traumatic SCI in&#xD;
      Italy, Ireland, India, Pakistan, Switzerland, the Netherlands, US, Australia and Canada.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The survey will be used to gather descriptive data to review the various forms of care and&#xD;
      rehabilitation services available to children and adolescents with SCI in SIN unit catchment&#xD;
      areas. In addition, telephone or Skype-interviews will be used to complement data when&#xD;
      necessary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following main issues will be explored (detailed questionnaire is available):&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Hospital setting, interaction with acute hospitals and referral processes II.&#xD;
      Rehabilitation beds and patient case-mix III. Spinal rehabilitation and staffing and therapy&#xD;
      intensity IV. Availability of secondary staff, ancillary services and support V. Life long&#xD;
      follow-up&#xD;
&#xD;
      Also, the following background information will be collected:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. SCI-prevention programmes in the region&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Brief review of the implementation of child protection in each region&#xD;
&#xD;
      The questionnaire will be available both electronically and in a paper version in English and&#xD;
      will be completed by the local principal investigator (PI) or by a representative from each&#xD;
      of the participating units chosen by the local PI. The local PI will be a bilingual person&#xD;
      with good local knowledge. Clarification of responses will occur in cooperation between the&#xD;
      local PI and the project manager at Sunnaas. Descriptive analysis will be performed with the&#xD;
      median and interquartile range (IQR) reported for numerical data not normally distributed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study II (explorative study/ interviews) An inductive, exploratory study with a qualitative&#xD;
      design will be chosen to obtain a detailed description and understanding of how children aged&#xD;
      of 13-17 years, perceive living with SCI in SIN-unit catchment areas.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Individual, face-to-face interviews will be conducted based on a thematic, semi-structured&#xD;
      interview guide with relevant follow-up questions. The interviews will take place in the&#xD;
      informant's home or another place chosen by the informant. Ninety minutes or more will be&#xD;
      allowed for each interview. Due to Corona restrictions virual interviews on a safe digital&#xD;
      platform like Teams or Norske Helsenett will be allowed. This apply especially for the&#xD;
      additional Norwegian interviews as they are planned to take place during the autumn of 2020&#xD;
      and spring of 2021.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A semi-structured interview guide has been developed in cooperation between researchers and&#xD;
      clinicians with experience in working with children and adolescents. Appropriate open ended&#xD;
      questions are listed within each main area of the interview and key-questions are marked to&#xD;
      assure that they are asked for. A salutogenic approach with strength based questions built on&#xD;
      established principles and guidelines for psychosocial screening in young persons has been&#xD;
      used (EuTEACH; HEEADSSS assessment; HEADSSS assessment, Clinical Practice Guidelines).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Themes in the semi-structured interview guide (detailed interview guide is available):&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The injury/ the accident&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Acute care, rehabilitation and follow-up&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Daily living with SCI with a pediatric onset&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Home, education/employment, eating, activities, drugs, sexuality,&#xD;
           suicide/depression/self-image, safety (HEEADSSS)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Resources and networks&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Health&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Peer learning/ role models&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The future/ life goals&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pilot interviews will be conducted to test the interview guide before deciding on a final&#xD;
      version that will be translated to all relevant languages.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To assure that all interviews are conducted in a good manner in different units, an&#xD;
      educational curriculum will be developed. Also, the interviewers will be trained in a 2-day&#xD;
      seminar. All interviews will be taped with a digital voice recorder and transcribed verbatim&#xD;
      in each unit. The transcripts will be translated to Norwegian by bilingual translators with&#xD;
      knowledge of neurological rehabilitation and analyzed using inductive qualitative content&#xD;
      analysis seeking to identify both manifest categories and underlying, latent meanings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS Ethical approval will be applied for in each country (Norway, Sweden,&#xD;
      China, Russia, US, Israel and Palestine). All encoded material will be entered in a database&#xD;
      at the Department of Research, Sunnaas Rehabilitation Hospital. Passkey will be stored&#xD;
      separately and locked in a fireproof safe. Recorded/taped interviews will be transcribed and&#xD;
      encoded and both the audio file (also encoded) and the transcript will be stored in a locked,&#xD;
      fireproof safe.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Candidate participants will be approached and informed about the study by a letter. The&#xD;
      letter will explain (1) the purpose of the study, (2) the procedures and (3) confidentiality.&#xD;
      The participant will be informed about their right to withdraw at any time and for any reason&#xD;
      without affecting your treatment by any means. The letter will include an 'Informed Consent&#xD;
      Form' that he/she and his/her caregivers must sign and date and return to their study site&#xD;
      before they can participate.&#xD;
