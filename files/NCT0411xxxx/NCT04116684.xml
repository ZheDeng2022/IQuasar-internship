  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to determine the effectiveness of home digital blood&#xD;
      pressure monitoring in aiding providers to maintain blood pressure within a therapeutic range&#xD;
      in type B aortic dissection patients upon discharge from the hospital.&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients admitted to the Cleveland Clinic Main Campus with a diagnosis of type B aortic&#xD;
      dissection or intramural hematoma who do not receive a surgical intervention during their&#xD;
      index hospitalization, or planned intervention on follow up, and are discharged on medical&#xD;
      therapy consisting of strict heart rate control and BP control will be included in the study.&#xD;
      They will be either randomized to standard therapy to measure BP at home (standard of care)&#xD;
      or intervention arm consisting of Withings Wireless Blood Pressure Monitor, which will&#xD;
      transmit BP recordings from smartphone to MyChart/EPIC (test arm). All patients will first&#xD;
      receive a 24 hour ambulatory monitor regardless of treatment assignment to establish baseline&#xD;
      BP pattern. Following this patients randomized to intervention arm will utilize their&#xD;
      Withings Blood Pressure Monitor. Providers on the study team will then adjust the patient's&#xD;
      hypertensive medications to ensure their BP is below a systolic goal of 120 mmHg utilizing&#xD;
      downloaded recordings available in the electronic medical record.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary clinical endpoint is the change in mean 24 hour systolic blood pressure between&#xD;
      the start of the study and the end of the study period (4-week period). Secondary outcomes&#xD;
      will include the number of patients able to achieve a therapeutic systolic blood pressure of&#xD;
      120 mmHg with both mean BP cuff and in office visit at end of 4 week period, increase in size&#xD;
      as measured by computed tomography (CT) scan of the aorta, hospitalization or emergency room&#xD;
      (ER) visits for symptoms from dissection or uncontrolled hypertension, hospitalization or ER&#xD;
      visits for hypotension, all-cause mortality, and need for surgical intervention (open or&#xD;
      endovascular).&#xD;
