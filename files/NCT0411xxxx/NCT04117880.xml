  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 2, multicenter, open-label study evaluating the overall systemic and ocular&#xD;
      safety profile of ataluren in nonsense mutation aniridia as determined by the incidences of&#xD;
      treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) as well as abnormal findings on laboratory&#xD;
      assessments, vital signs, physical examinations, ophthalmoscopy, and slit-lamp examination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants who complete PTC124-GD-028 ANI (NCT02647359) meet all inclusion and none of the&#xD;
      exclusion criteria will be enrolled into this study.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
        Participants who will be selected for this study must meet the following criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Evidence of signed and dated informed consent document(s) indicating that the study&#xD;
             candidate (and/or a parent/legal guardian) has been informed of all pertinent aspects&#xD;
             of the study. Note: If the study candidate is considered a child under local&#xD;
             regulation, a parent or legal guardian must provide written consent prior to&#xD;
             initiation of study screening procedures and the study candidate may be required to&#xD;
             provide written assent. The rules of the responsible institutional review&#xD;
             board/independent ethics committee (IRB/IEC) regarding whether one or both parents&#xD;
             must provide consent and the appropriate ages for obtaining consent and assent from&#xD;
             the participant should be followed.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Must have participated in and exited from Study PTC124-GD-028 ANI&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Age ≥2 years and of either gender.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Body weight ≥12 kg.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Willingness and ability to comply with scheduled visits, drug administration plan,&#xD;
             study procedures, and study restrictions.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Good general health.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Female participants of childbearing potential are eligible for the study but must be&#xD;
             willing to use adequate (at least 1 form of) contraceptive methods as described below&#xD;
             during the study treatment period (starting from the day of first dose of study drug&#xD;
             and ending 60 days after the last dose of study drug). Childbearing potential is&#xD;
             defined as participants who have experienced menarche and who are neither&#xD;
             postmenopausal or have been permanently sterilized.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Hormonal methods of contraception (including oral and transdermal contraceptives,&#xD;
                  injectable progesterone, progestin subdermal implants, progesterone-releasing&#xD;
                  intrauterine contraceptive devices [IUDs]) initiated at least 14 days prior to&#xD;
                  the first dose of study drug&#xD;

&#xD;
               -  Postmenopausal at least 12 months prior to first dose of study drug or&#xD;
                  permanently sterilized (for example, tubal occlusion, hysterectomy, bilateral&#xD;
                  salpingectomy)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Male partner who has had a vasectomy for at least 3 months prior to the first&#xD;
                  dose of study drug&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Male participants with partners of childbearing potential must agree to use the&#xD;
             following adequate (at least 1 form of) contraception during the study treatment&#xD;
             period (starting from the day of first dose of study drug and ending 60 days after the&#xD;
             last dose of study drug):&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Abstinence&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Vasectomy for at least 3 months prior to first dose of study drug or surgically&#xD;
                  sterile&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Without a vasectomy, must use a condom with spermicidal foam/gel/film/cream&#xD;
                  suppository&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
        The presence of any of the following conditions will exclude a participant from study&#xD;
        enrollment:&#xD;
&#xD;
        General exclusion criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Participation in any drug or device clinical investigation (other than Study&#xD;
             PTC124-GD-028 ANI) within 90 days prior to Visit 1 (Screening) or anticipation of&#xD;
             participating in any other drug or device clinical investigation during this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Surgery within 30 days prior to enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Female participants who are pregnant or breastfeeding. Female participants of&#xD;
             childbearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test (beta-human chorionic&#xD;
             gonadotropin [β-HCG]) at screening and must use adequate (at least 1 form of)&#xD;
             contraceptive methods.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Active ocular infection or inflammation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Prior or ongoing medical condition (for example, concomitant illness, alcoholism, drug&#xD;
             abuse, psychiatric condition), medical history, physical findings, or laboratory&#xD;
             abnormality that, in the Investigator's opinion, could adversely affect the safety of&#xD;
             the participant, makes it unlikely that the course of study drug administration or&#xD;
             follow-up would be completed, or could impair the assessment of study results.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Participants with a positive result for hepatitis B, hepatitis C, or human&#xD;
             immunodeficiency virus at Visit 1 (Screening).&#xD;
