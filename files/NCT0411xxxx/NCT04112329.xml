  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this project is to assess if playing a newly developed videogame that require&#xD;
      physical activity (e.g. exergame) can lead to increased physical activity, aerobic fitness&#xD;
      and health benefits in sedentary adults. The project will include 28 sedentary adults, 18&#xD;
      years and above, who are not sufficiently active according to current guidelines defined as&#xD;
      doing (&lt;150 minutes/week of moderate intensity physical activity or &lt;75 minutes/week of&#xD;
      vigorous physical activity and/or do not do any regular endurance training ). The physical&#xD;
      fitness (maximal oxygen consumption), blood pressure, body composition and objectively&#xD;
      measured physical activity will be tested before and after the intervention period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Also, the participants gaming frequency will be registered throughout the 8 week period. Aim&#xD;
      of this study is to investigate if access to this game can provide health benefits for adults&#xD;
      who are not motivated to take part in regular physical activity.&#xD;
