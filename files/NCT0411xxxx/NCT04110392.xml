  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Currently, the changes generated in lifestyle, such as excessive consumption of saturated&#xD;
      fats and refined carbohydrates, as well as the decrease in the intake of fiber, fruits,&#xD;
      vegetables and antioxidants, as well as physical inactivity, have generated an increase in&#xD;
      the prevalence of dyslipidemias. Dyslipidemias are a disorder of blood lipid and lipoprotein&#xD;
      concentration, which increases the risk of developing atherosclerosis and cardiovascular&#xD;
      diseases. In Mexico, the dyslipidemias are present in one in four Mexicans over 20 years old.&#xD;
      However, in Yucatan increases this frequency increases due to one in three people suffer from&#xD;
      dyslipidemia. Its prevalence is even higher in overweight subjects, diabetes and high blood&#xD;
      pressure. Thus, it is important to search for strategies to reduce dyslipidemias, as well as&#xD;
      the complications associated with them. The treatment and prevention of dyslipidemia is&#xD;
      through dietary treatment, which may be accompanied by the consumption of foods that generate&#xD;
      beneficial health effects due to the presence of bioactive compounds. Chaya (Cnidoscolus&#xD;
      chayamansa) is a plant use in popular medicine to treat medicine in the treatment of chronic&#xD;
      degenerative diseases. It contained different bioactive compounds such as flavonoids, vitamin&#xD;
      C and polyphenols such as quercetin and kaempferol. Compounds that have been assigned various&#xD;
      beneficial effects such as decreased triglyceride concentrations, cholesterol,&#xD;
      malondialdehyde, C-Reactive protein, oxidized LDL, which are alterations that are present in&#xD;
      dyslipidemia. Therefore, the consumption of this food could be an adequate strategy for&#xD;
      subjects with dyslipidemia in Yucatan and Mexico due to the anti-inflammatory and antioxidant&#xD;
      effects, and could reduce the risk of developing atherosclerosis and cardiovascular diseases.&#xD;

      The protocol will be carried out in the Hospital Regional de Alta Especialidad de la&#xD;
      Península de Yucatán (HRAEPY). It is quasi-experimental and it was proposed before and after&#xD;
      study, the study will be consisting in 6 subsequent visits and a last visit to deliver&#xD;
      results to the participant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the pre-visit, the subjects will be evaluated to determine if they meet the inclusion&#xD;
      criteria. They will be explained what the study consists of, the characteristics, the risks&#xD;
      and the expected benefits after the intervention, they will be asked to read the consent&#xD;
      letter, doubts will be clarified about it and if the participant agrees to be in the study&#xD;
      the signature will be made of the consent letter.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the beginning and end will be taken two blood samples of 5 mL to each participant. One&#xD;
      will be to obtain the serum and measure cholesterol-HDL, cholesterol-LDL, triglycerides,&#xD;
      total cholesterol, glucose, antioxidant activity, malondialdehyde (MDA) and C-reactive&#xD;
      protein. The second sample will be to the extraction of peripheral leukocyte blood&#xD;
      mononuclear cells and determine the gene expression of antioxidants enzymes superoxide&#xD;
      dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT). Blood pressure will be measured with a digital&#xD;
      baumanometer while the participant will remain seated with the right arm uncovered. The&#xD;
      measurement will be carried out 6 times, in intervals of 3 minutes. The first measurement&#xD;
      will be discarded and the average of the remaining measurements will be reported. In the&#xD;
      visits will bring to each participant an attachment to reported intake of the beverage.&#xD;
      During the following ones it will always be questioned if there is any problem with the&#xD;
      drinking the beverage of Chaya.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of the study, participants will be given the document with their results and will&#xD;
      be given recommendations for weight control, dietary recommendations to improve lipid&#xD;
      concentrations. They will refer to their doctor for follow-up with their laboratory results&#xD;
      for their control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Description of the intervention&#xD;
&#xD;
      Chaya Water Beverage of Chaya will be prepared as follows: 40 g of Chaya leaves will be&#xD;
      treated with a commercial brand disinfectant following the manufacturer's instructions for&#xD;
      use, then added 1L of purified water and mixed in blender. Finally, 500 mL of it will be&#xD;
      placed in bottles. Participants will be instructed to consume 1 bottle per day for 6 weeks. 7&#xD;
      bottles will be delivered at each visit, which will be consumed during the week; participants&#xD;
      will be instructed to keep the water refrigerated until it is consumed.&#xD;
