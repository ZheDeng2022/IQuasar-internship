    <textblock>
      This phase II trial how well regorafenib and anti-EGFR therapy (cetuximab or panitumumab)&#xD;
      works for the treatment of patients with colorectal cancer that cannot be removed by surgery&#xD;
      (unresectable), has spread to nearby tissue or lymph nodes (locally advanced), or has spread&#xD;
      to other places in the body (metastatic). Regorafenib may stop the growth of cancer cells by&#xD;
      blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Monoclonal antibodies, such as cetuximab&#xD;
      or panitumumab, may interfere with the ability of cancer cells to grow and spread. Drugs used&#xD;
      in chemotherapy, such as irinotecan, work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer&#xD;
      cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from&#xD;
      spreading. The purpose of this research study is to compare the effects, good and/or bad, of&#xD;
      taking regorafenib follow by cetuximab or panitumumab, to those that receive cetuximab or&#xD;
      panitumumab before regorafenib.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To compare the overall survival between evaluable patients who were randomized to receive&#xD;
      regorafenib followed by anti-EGFR monoclonal antibody therapy compared to those that receive&#xD;
      anti-EGFR monoclonal antibody followed by regorafenib.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To compare the first progression free survival (PFS1) of patients between evaluable&#xD;
      patients who were randomized to receive regorafenib followed by anti-EGFR monoclonal antibody&#xD;
      therapy compared to those that receive anti-EGFR monoclonal antibody followed by regorafenib&#xD;
      II. To compare the second progression free survival (PFS2) of patients between evaluable&#xD;
      patients who were randomized to receive regorafenib followed by anti-EGFR monoclonal antibody&#xD;
      therapy compared to those that receive anti-EGFR monoclonal antibody followed by regorafenib.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To compare the sequential treatment progression free survival (stPFS) of patients&#xD;
      between evaluable patients who were randomized to receive regorafenib followed by anti-EGFR&#xD;
      monoclonal antibody therapy compared to those that receive anti-EGFR monoclonal antibody&#xD;
      followed by regorafenib.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To assess the frequency and severity of adverse events between evaluable patients who&#xD;
      were randomized to receive regorafenib followed by anti-EGFR monoclonal antibody therapy&#xD;
      compared to those that receive anti-EGFR monoclonal antibody followed by regorafenib.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. To compare the objective response rate (ORR), while on initial treatment, between&#xD;
      evaluable patients who were randomized to receive regorafenib followed by anti-EGFR&#xD;
      monoclonal antibody therapy compared to those that receive anti-EGFR monoclonal antibody&#xD;
      followed by regorafenib VI. To compare the objective response rate (ORR), while on sequential&#xD;
      treatment, between evaluable patients who were randomized to receive regorafenib followed by&#xD;
      anti-EGFR monoclonal antibody therapy compared to those that receive anti-EGFR monoclonal&#xD;
      antibody prior to regorafenib.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CORRELATIVE RESEARCH OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To assess plasma pharmacodynamics biomarkers of response and resistance to therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To explore any correlation between tissue and blood based biomarkers and clinical&#xD;
      outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM A: Patients receive regorafenib orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-21. Cycles repeat&#xD;
      every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Per the&#xD;
      treating physician's discretion, patients who experience disease progression may initiate a&#xD;
      treatment regimen consisting of cetuximab or panitumumab intravenously (IV) over 30-90&#xD;
      minutes on days 1 and 15. Patients may also receive irinotecan IV on days 1 and 15 as&#xD;
      determined by the study doctor. Cycles repeat every 28 days until disease progression or&#xD;
      unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM B: Patients receive cetuximab or panitumumab IV over 30-90 minutes on days 1 and 15.&#xD;
      Patients may also receive irinotecan IV on days 1 and 15 as determined by the study doctor.&#xD;
      Cycles repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
      Per the treating physician's discretion, patients who experience disease progression may&#xD;
      initiate a treatment regimen consisting of regorafenib PO QD on days 1-21. Cycles repeat&#xD;
      every 28 days until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days, and then every 3&#xD;
      months for up to 3 years after randomization.&#xD;
