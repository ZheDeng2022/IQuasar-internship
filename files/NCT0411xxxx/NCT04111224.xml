      This study will assess the role of pentraxin3 (PTX3) in the early diagnosis of&#xD;
      ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and the detection of antibiotic sensitivity for&#xD;
      different organisms isolated from tracheal aspirate.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Ventilator associated pneumonia (VAP) is a type of hospital-acquired pneumonia that occurs&#xD;
      more than 48h after endotracheal intubation. This can be further classified into early onset&#xD;
      (within the first 96 hours of mechanical ventilation (MV) and late onset (more than 96 hours&#xD;
      after the initiation of MV), which is more commonly attributable to multidrug-resistant&#xD;
      pathogens Ventilator associated pneumonia is common in critical care patients and is&#xD;
      responsible for around half of all antibiotics given to patients in intensive care units.&#xD;
      International Nosocomial Infection Control Consortium suggest that the overall rate of VAP is&#xD;
      13.6 per 1000 ventilator days. However, the individual rate varies according to patient&#xD;
      group, risk factors and hospital setting. The average time taken to develop VAP from the&#xD;
      initiation of MV is around 5 to 7 days, with a mortality rate quoted as between 24% and 76%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The key to the development of VAP is the presence of an endotracheal tube (EET) or&#xD;
      tracheostomy, both of which interfere with the normal anatomy and physiology of respiratory&#xD;
      tract, specifically the functional mechanisms involved in clearing secretion (cough and&#xD;
      mucociliary action).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intubated patients have a reduced level of consciousness that impairs voluntary clearance of&#xD;
      secretions, which may then pool in the oropharynx. This leads to the macro aspiration and&#xD;
      micro aspiration of contaminated oropharyngeal secretions that are rich in harmful pathogens.&#xD;
      Normal oral flora starts to proliferate and are able to pass along the tracheal tube, forming&#xD;
      an antibiotic-resistant biofilm which eventually reaches the lower airways.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Critically unwell patients exhibit an impaired ability to mount an immune response to these&#xD;
      pathogens, leading to the development of a pneumonia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Early-onset VAP, occurring within the first four days of MV, is usually caused by&#xD;
      antibiotic-sensitive community-acquired bacteria such as Hemophilus and Streptococcus. VAP&#xD;
      developing more than 5 days after initiation of MV is usually caused by multidrug-resistant&#xD;
      bacteria such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The clinical pulmonary infection score (CPIS) based on variables (fever, leukocytosis,&#xD;
      tracheal aspirates, oxygenation radiographic infiltrates). CPIS is helpful to diagnosis VAP&#xD;
      in patient but it is not sufficient for definite diagnosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The accurate diagnosis of VAP in children and adults is still an unsolved problem, delayed&#xD;
      diagnosis of VAP and subsequent delay in initiating appropriate therapy may cause worse&#xD;
      outcomes in patients with VAP. On the other hand, an incorrect diagnosis may lead to&#xD;
      unnecessary treatment and subsequent complications that are related to therapy.&#xD;
      Over-treatment with antibiotics increases clinical risks such as Clostridium&#xD;
      difficile-associated colitis and antibiotic resistance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several criteria have been proposed for diagnosing VAP in clinical settings, including&#xD;
      clinical manifestations, imaging techniques, methods to obtain and interpret bronchoalveolar&#xD;
      specimens, and biomarkers of host response. However, there is no acceptable gold standard&#xD;
      modality yet and the accuracy of these methods in diagnosing VAP is controversial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Microbiological analysis and identification of organisms may take 48-72 h, false-negative&#xD;
      results may occur as a result of concomitant or previous antibiotic treatment, whereas false&#xD;
      positives may represent colonization or sampling errors. Biomarkers have been seen as a&#xD;
      potential avenue for improving speed and accuracy of clinical diagnosis, or to allow&#xD;
      withdrawal of therapy because of the clinical resolution of VAP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pentraxins are phylogenetically conserved proteins characterized by a multimeric structure&#xD;
      and divided into short (C -reactive protein (CRP) and serum amyloid P component) and long&#xD;
      pentraxins.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PTX3 is the first identified member of the long pentraxin subfamily. It can be rapidly&#xD;
      produced and released by mononuclear phagocytes, neutrophils, epithelial and endothelial&#xD;
      cells in response to primary inflammatory signals (IL-1, and TNF-Î±).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pentraxin3 (PTX3) is an acute-phase inflammatory mediator whose levels increase rapidly in&#xD;
      inflammatory and infectious conditions. Increased PTX3 levels are correlated with the&#xD;
      severity of lung injury and infection.&#xD;
