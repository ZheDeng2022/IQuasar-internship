  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to evaluate prospectively the impact of different system alerts&#xD;
      on the prescription of lipid panels to pediatric Geisinger patients (9-11 years old), as per&#xD;
      the now-universal guidelines. This will help quantify the relative effectiveness of different&#xD;
      alerts and combinations of alerts on provider prescribing behavior and patient uptake of&#xD;
      screening.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients who are eligible for this study will be randomized into one of four groups via an&#xD;
      Epic electronic medical record (EMR) randomization algorithm run automatically at the time of&#xD;
      the visit:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Control group (6-month delay before their providers will receive an alert)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Health maintenance topic (HMT)&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Best practice alert (BPA)&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Best practice alert and health maintenance topic (BPA+HMT)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Geisinger Health System will introduce Epic's Storyboard panel (a novel way of summarizing&#xD;
      patient information in the EMR) approximately one month into this study. The analysis plan&#xD;
      will therefore test for the potential impact of this change.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The providers will be prompted to discuss and order screening lipid study that is non fasting&#xD;
      at the time of the visit with the patient, based on the alerts above. Some families will have&#xD;
      an alert in their MyGeisinger portal stating that a health maintenance test is due and to&#xD;
      discuss with their provider.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcomes will be reviewed and classified as followed,&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcomes will include lipid screening orders by providers (yes/no) and screening completions&#xD;
      by patients (yes/no). The following descriptive results will also be provided:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Lipid screening ordered&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Lipid screening ordered and completed&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Lipid screening ordered but not completed&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Lipid screening declined with reason why&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Alert not acted on at all&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis will account for the nesting of patients within providers; this will include&#xD;
      provider as a random effects variable in a series of multilevel binomial logistic regression&#xD;
      models, to account for potential correlation with patients. If the intraclass correlation&#xD;
      coefficient is low, only the patient-level logistic regression models will be conducted. In&#xD;
      the first model, the passive control will serve as the reference group, to test whether each&#xD;
      of the active alert conditions have a significant impact on the outcomes. In the second&#xD;
      model, the BPA-only condition will serve as the reference group, to test whether HMT and&#xD;
      BPA+HMT offer significant improvements in performance. Finally, the third model will use the&#xD;
      HMT-only condition as the reference, to test whether BPA+HMT has a significantly greater&#xD;
      impact on the outcomes. Storyboard X Condition interactions will be tested within the models,&#xD;
      and if any are significant, the series of models will be conducted separately on patients&#xD;
      prior to, and after, implementation of Storyboard in Epic, to test whether and how results&#xD;
      replicate in the different contexts.&#xD;
