  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase 1 open-label, single center, dose escalation study to determine a safe and&#xD;
      effective maximum tolerated dose of HS-130 in combination with viagenpumatucel-L (HS-110) for&#xD;
      adult subjects with advanced solid tumors who are refractory to Standard of Care.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, non-controlled, first-in-human Phase I study of HS-130 and HS-110 in&#xD;
      patients with advanced solid tumors refractory to, or ineligible for, Standard of Care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Seven dose levels will be explored in escalating doses. For each dose level, patients will&#xD;
      receive combination HS-130 and HS-110 via intradermal injections once every 14 days. The Dose&#xD;
      Limiting Toxicity (DLT) window of observation will include the first 28 days of treatment. In&#xD;
      the absence of progressive disease or unacceptable toxicity, patients will continue to&#xD;
      receive combination treatment every two weeks until disease progression, death, patient's&#xD;
      withdrawal of consent, Investigator decision to discontinue treatment, or intolerable&#xD;
      toxicity, whichever occurs first.&#xD;
