  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Traditionally, patients are asked to fast prior to invasive cardiac procedures. There exists&#xD;
      neither clear evidence nor guidance about the benefits of this.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis/Objective :&#xD;
&#xD;
      To show that allowing unrestricted oral intake before a coronary interventional procedure is&#xD;
      not inferior to imposing a pre-procedural fasting period, in terms of adverse events, in&#xD;
      patients requiring coronary angiography or a planned or semi-urgent percutaneous coronary&#xD;
      intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Method:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is a prospective, monocentric, controlled, single-blind, randomized trial in two&#xD;
      parallel arms. The investigating physician performing the interventional procedure and&#xD;
      evaluating the safety judgment criteria will not be informed of the patient's randomization&#xD;
      arm. In order to keep the blind, the medical and paramedical staff of the interventional&#xD;
      cardiology room will not inquire about the fasting status of patients included in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients are randomized either to the pre-procedural fasting arm or to the absence of&#xD;
      pre-procedural fasting.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  No intervention: Pre-procedural fasting is defined by the absence of ingestion of fluids&#xD;
           or solid food for at least 6 hours before the examination.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Experimental: free feeding and drinking until the procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients are followed for 4 hours after the end of the procedure at the hospital for adverse&#xD;
      events (vagal discomfort, nausea, vomiting or hypoglycaemia).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Then a follow-up will be done at day 7 after the procedure (by telephone for outpatients or&#xD;
      discharged from the hospital and in the cardiology department for patients still hospitalized&#xD;
      on D7) to look for the occurrence of acute renal failure or pneumonia&#xD;

    <measure>Adverse events linked to oral intake before cardiac procedure: vasovagal complications or nausea or vomiting or hypoglycemia</measure>
    <time_frame>4 hours</time_frame>
    <description>Vagal reaction is defined by the presence of at least two of the following criteria occurring during the procedure or closure of the arterial approach or during the post-procedural observation phase, in the absence of other explanations:&#xD;
nausea / vomiting, skin paleness, sweating&#xD;
decrease in systolic pressure &lt;100mmHg (or 15% decrease in baseline if systolic blood pressure &lt;100 mmHg baseline)&#xD;
decrease in heart rate below 60 bpm (or more than 15% decrease if basal heart rate is below 60bpm) .&#xD;
Nausea evaluated by interrogation; vomiting noted by the doctor or nurse&#xD;
Hypoglycemia defined by the measurement of a glycemia lower than or equal to 0.70 mg / dL. This measurement is performed in the examination room at the beginning and end of the procedure on blood taken from the arterial sheath.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Post procedural acute renal failure</measure>
    <time_frame>5 days</time_frame>
    <description>Defined by a 25% increase in serum creatinine compared with basal level, or an increase in serum creatinine of more than 44 μmol/l in 3 days after injection of contrast medium</description>

    <measure>Post procedural aspiration pneumonia</measure>
