      Design: U.S.-based, single-center, proof-of-concept study&#xD;
&#xD;
      Brief Description: A standard clinical contrast-enhanced chest CT scan performed 48 hours&#xD;
      after clinically-indicated standard anticoagulation will be compared with a standard&#xD;
      clinically-indicated baseline contrast-enhanced chest CT scan using a previously-studied and&#xD;
      previously-validated 3-dimensional reconstruction technique to assess changes in the&#xD;
      pulmonary vasculature in patients with acute pulmonary embolism (PE). This previously-studied&#xD;
      and previously-validated 3-dimensional reconstruction technique has been used to assess the&#xD;
      response of the pulmonary vasculature to catheter-based fibrinolysis in acute PE as well as&#xD;
      to assess the pulmonary vasculature in a number of chronic lung diseases. However, the&#xD;
      pulmonary vascular response to standard anticoagulation for acute PE has not been assessed&#xD;
      previously.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Purpose: To compare the pulmonary vasculature before and after standard clinically-indicated&#xD;
      anticoagulation for acute PE using a previously-studied and previously-validated&#xD;
      3-dimensional reconstruction technique applied with a standard clinically-indicated baseline&#xD;
      contrast-enhanced chest CT scan (used to diagnose the acute PE) and a standard clinical&#xD;
      contrast-enhanced chest CT scan performed 48 hours later as indicated by the study protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Population: Inpatients diagnosed with acute PE, in whom clinical providers have prescribed&#xD;
      standard anticoagulation alone for treatment based on clinical grounds at Brigham and Women's&#xD;
      Hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Enrollment: 10 subjects with acute PE&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical Site Location: Single-center, Brigham and Women's Hospital&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Duration: 12 months&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Imaging Outcome: CT-determined percent change in perfusion of the pulmonary&#xD;
      vasculature from baseline to 48 hours in inpatients diagnosed with acute PE, in whom clinical&#xD;
      providers have prescribed standard anticoagulation alone for treatment based on clinical&#xD;
      grounds at Brigham and Women's Hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Imaging Outcome: CT-determined percent change in right ventricular (RV) volume from&#xD;
      baseline to 48 hours in inpatients diagnosed with acute PE, in whom clinical providers have&#xD;
      prescribed standard anticoagulation alone for treatment based on clinical grounds at Brigham&#xD;
      and Women's Hospital.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The pulmonary vascular response to ultrasound-facilitated, catheter-directed fibrinolysis for&#xD;
      treatment of pulmonary embolism (PE) results in rapid improvement in patient symptoms and&#xD;
      right ventricular (RV) recovery, while minimizing the risk of intracranial hemorrhage. The&#xD;
      investigators recently completed an analysis of the chest computed tomographic (CT) data from&#xD;
      the SEATTLE II Trial of ultrasound-facilitated, catheter-directed fibrinolysis for treatment&#xD;
      of PE using a previously-validated 3-dimensional (3D) reconstruction technique pioneered at&#xD;
      Brigham and Women's Hospital (BWH). This software-based 3D technique enables anatomic and&#xD;
      structural resolution of the distal pulmonary arteries (microvasculature) far beyond the&#xD;
      imaging capabilities of clinically utilized methods. This technique also provides a precise&#xD;
      quantitation of RV volume and quantification of the perfusion of the proximal and distal&#xD;
      pulmonary arteries. In our 3D reconstruction analysis of the multicenter, U.S.-based SEATTLE&#xD;
      II Trial chest CT data, the investigators found that loss of intraparenchymal blood vessel&#xD;
      volume was associated with RV enlargement and change in distal small vessel pulmonary artery&#xD;
      perfusion predicted RV recovery with ultrasound-facilitated, catheter-directed fibrinolysis&#xD;
      in subjects with acute PE. These data were presented at the American Heart Association (AHA)&#xD;
      Annual Scientific Sessions in 2017 and have been submitted for publication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While ultrasound-facilitated, catheter-directed fibrinolysis has been studied using this 3D&#xD;
      reconstruction technique, the pulmonary vascular response in PE patients treated clinically&#xD;
      with anticoagulation alone has not been. The investigators propose a study to evaluate&#xD;
      inpatients diagnosed with acute PE, in whom clinical providers have already prescribed&#xD;
      standard anticoagulation alone for treatment based on clinical grounds at Brigham and Women's&#xD;
      Hospital, applying this 3-dimensional reconstruction technique to compare data from a&#xD;
      standard clinical contrast-enhanced chest CT scan performed 48 hours after initiation of&#xD;
      therapy and those data from the standard clinically-indicated baseline contrast-enhanced&#xD;
      chest CT scan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The specific aims for this proposed study are as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim #1: To quantify the CT-determined percent change in perfusion of the pulmonary&#xD;
      vasculature from baseline to 48 hours in inpatients diagnosed with acute PE, in whom clinical&#xD;
      providers have prescribed standard anticoagulation alone for treatment based on clinical&#xD;
      grounds at Brigham and Women's Hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis #1: The greatest change in pulmonary vascular perfusion following anticoagulation&#xD;
      alone for acute PE will take place in the distal small (&lt;5 mm2 cross-sectional area)&#xD;
      pulmonary arteries compared with larger (&gt;5 mm2 cross-sectional area) vessels. However, the&#xD;
      magnitude of change will be less than that observed in our previously reported analysis&#xD;
      focused on patients with acute PE undergoing ultrasound-facilitated, catheter-based&#xD;
      fibrinolysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim #2: To quantify the CT-determined percent change in RV volume from baseline to 48 hours&#xD;
      in inpatients diagnosed with acute PE, in whom clinical providers have prescribed standard&#xD;
      anticoagulation alone for treatment based on clinical grounds at Brigham and Women's&#xD;
      Hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis #2: RV volume will decrease over 48 hours of anticoagulation alone but the percent&#xD;
      change will be less than that observed in our previously reported analysis focused on&#xD;
      patients with acute PE undergoing ultrasound-facilitated, catheter-based fibrinolysis&#xD;
