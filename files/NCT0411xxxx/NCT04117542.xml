  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Loss of control (LOC) eating in children is associated with multiple physical and mental&#xD;
      health impairments, including obesity and eating disorders. Little is known about the&#xD;
      developmental neurobiology of LOC, which is crucial to specifying its pathophysiology and the&#xD;
      development of effective preventive interventions. Individual differences in working memory&#xD;
      (WM) appear to be related to LOC eating and excess weight status in youth, but the&#xD;
      specificity and neural correlates of these individual differences are unclear. Failure to&#xD;
      adequately understand the nature of associations between WM and eating behavior in children&#xD;
      with overweight/obesity limits the development of appropriately-targeted,&#xD;
      neuro-developmentally informed interventions addressing problematic eating and related weight&#xD;
      gain in youth. To close this clinical research gap, the current study proposes to investigate&#xD;
      the context-dependence of WM impairment and its neural correlates in children with&#xD;
      concomitant overweight/ obesity and LOC eating as compared to their overweight/obese peers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific aims are to investigate:&#xD;
&#xD;
      1)WM performance in youth with LOC eating relative to overweight/obese controls during&#xD;
      recalls in the context of food-related versus neutral distractors; and 2) neural activation&#xD;
      patterns during WM performance across both food-related and neutral stimuli. We hypothesize&#xD;
      that, relative to their overweight/obese peers, youth with LOC eating will show 1) more&#xD;
      errors and slower response times during recalls involving food-related vs. neutral&#xD;
      distractors, and fewer errors and faster response times during recalls involving food-related&#xD;
      vs. neutral targets; 2) increased activation in prefrontal regions during WM performance&#xD;
      across stimuli types relative to overweight/obese controls, and 3) even greater activation in&#xD;
      the context of food-related versus neutral distractors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed study is the first to use state-of-the-science neuroimaging methodology to&#xD;
      clarify the relations between WM and LOC eating, with strong potential to advance&#xD;
      understanding of the associations among executive functioning, excess weight status, and&#xD;
      eating pathology, and inform the development of interventions (e.g., WM training) to&#xD;
      alleviate their cumulative personal and societal burden.&#xD;
