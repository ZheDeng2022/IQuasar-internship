      Prospective feasibility and validation study of a novel, near-to-care modality for diagnosis&#xD;
      of malignancy among cancer suspects.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Prospective feasibility and validation study of a novel contrast microhalography (CEM) device&#xD;
      for diagnosis of malignancy in Botswana. Consenting patients identified by their providers as&#xD;
      requiring a fine needle aspirate (FNA) or percutaneous biopsy for assessment for possible&#xD;
      lymphoma or breast cancer will undergo standard diagnostic procedure. Concurrently these&#xD;
      patients will have additional FNA fluid tested using the portable novel nanosensor-based&#xD;
      device (CEM). Diagnosis made from standard anatomic pathology, flow cytometry, and/or&#xD;
      cytology will be compared with the diagnosis made using the CEM platform. Assessment of the&#xD;
      feasibility and acceptability of the CEM platform will be performed. Assessment of training&#xD;
      requirements for CEM platform will be completed.&#xD;
