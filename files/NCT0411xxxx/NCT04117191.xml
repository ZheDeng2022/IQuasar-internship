  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is prevalent in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) and&#xD;
      is associated with extremely poor prognosis. Traditional risk factors for the general&#xD;
      population, such as diabetes mellitus, high blood pressure, and dyslipidemia, are more common&#xD;
      in patients with CKD but cannot fully explain the increased risk of this population. New&#xD;
      evidence suggests that the uremic milieu itself plays a critical role in the development and&#xD;
      progression of CVD. The gut microbiota is markedly altered in CKD, with overgrowth of&#xD;
      bacteria that produce uremic toxins. Indoxyl sulfate (IS) is among the most representative&#xD;
      gut-derived uremic toxins and has been most frequently implicated as a contributor to the&#xD;
      pathogenesis of CVD in CKD. IS is converted from indole, a gut bacteria metabolite of dietary&#xD;
      tryptophan, by two hepatic enzymes, CYP2E1 and SULT1A1. The majority of studies have assessed&#xD;
      IS toxicity in cultured cells and animal models. However, human data have been conflicting&#xD;
      and the benefit of using orally administered adsorbents to reduce IS levels in unselected CKD&#xD;
      patients was not supported by results from the recent randomized controlled trials. IS levels&#xD;
      may fluctuate widely from time to time with dietary intakes. The investigators hypothesize&#xD;
      that a postprandial IS concentration may more reflect its toxicity than a single time point&#xD;
      (fasting or predialysis IS) concentration measured in clinical studies. Therefore, the&#xD;
      investigators plan to establish an oral tryptophan challenge test (OTCT) by using an oral&#xD;
      loading of 2 gm tryptophan to simulate the postprandial increase of plasma IS. The&#xD;
      investigators will recruit 60 healthy volunteers to undergo OTCT. A pharmacokinetic study of&#xD;
      IS after the OTCT will be performed in 20 of them to verify and simplify the design of OTCT&#xD;
      protocol. The results of OTCT will be integrated with whole metagenome analysis of fecal&#xD;
      microbiota and genetic polymorphism analysis of CYP2E1 and SULT1A1 to explore the mechanisms&#xD;
      of IS production. In addition to the known genes in microbe produces indoles, other&#xD;
      supporting bacteria or genes will be examined by using metagenomic shotgun sequencing data.&#xD;
