    <textblock>
      A single quality questionnaire evaluating the symptoms of chronic rhinosinusitis in children&#xD;
      currently exists. It has been validated in English for children aged 2 to 12. It comprises&#xD;
      five areas of quality of life, each rated by a score ranging from 1 to 7 : sinus infection,&#xD;
      nasal obstruction, allergic symptoms, emotional distress and activity limitation, coupled&#xD;
      with an overall assessment of quality of life with an analogue visual scale (score from 1 to&#xD;
      10). This SN-5 (sinus and nasal quality of life survey) score showed excellent statistics of&#xD;
      reproducibility, internal validity and ease of response. It is currently used in several&#xD;
      international publications evaluating chronic sinus pathology in children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of the study is to validate the translation of the SN-5 questionnaire in&#xD;
      French.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Chronic rhinosinusitis is a common pathology that entrains significant medical consumption.&#xD;
      The prevalence of chronic rhinosinusitis in children is estimated to be 7.6%. Cardinal&#xD;
      symptoms include nasal congestion, purulent rhinorrhea, facial pain, and persistent daytime&#xD;
      cough. All these nasal symptoms often have an impact on the quality of life. The main&#xD;
      objective of medical treatment is to improve this quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The treatment of chronic rhinosinusitis is mainly medical and includes nose washes with&#xD;
      physiological serum, topical or general corticosteroid treatment or antibiotics. Surgical&#xD;
      treatments such as adenoidectomy or endonasal functional surgery are reserved for medical&#xD;
      treatment failures. According to a European consensus paper of 2012, the surgical strategy of&#xD;
      the chronic rhinosinusitis of the child must start with a adenoidectomy with physiological&#xD;
      serum washes, and then secondarily a endonasal functional surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The ability of quality of life questionnaires to measure subjective symptoms over a certain&#xD;
      length of time can help in the medical decision by determining the benefit of taking care. A&#xD;
      single quality questionnaire evaluating the symptoms of chronic rhinosinusitis in children&#xD;
      currently exists. It has been validated in English for children aged 2 to 12. It comprises&#xD;
      five areas of quality of life, each rated by a score ranging from 1 to 7 : sinus infection,&#xD;
      nasal obstruction, allergic symptoms, emotional distress and activity limitation, coupled&#xD;
      with an overall assessment of quality of life with an analogue visual scale (score from 1 to&#xD;
      10). This SN-5 (sinus and nasal quality of life survey) score showed excellent statistics of&#xD;
      reproducibility, internal validity and ease of response. It is currently used in several&#xD;
      international publications evaluating chronic sinus pathology in children.&#xD;
