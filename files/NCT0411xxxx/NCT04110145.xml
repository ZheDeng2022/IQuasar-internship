                  essential feature of a predominant disturbance in the acquisition of cognitive,&#xD;
                  motor, language, or social skills, which has a significant and continuing impact&#xD;
                  on the developmental progress of an individual) producing a cognitive delay that&#xD;
                  precludes comprehension and completion of the daily eDiary or other study-related&#xD;
                  questionnaires (Note: Participants are excluded if the person who will be&#xD;
                  completing the daily eDiary or other study-related questionnaires meets this&#xD;

                  assessments in this study&#xD;
&#xD;
              16. History of cancer other than treated basal cell carcinoma of the skin. (Note:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Participants with a history of cancer are allowed provided that the malignancy has been in&#xD;
        a complete remission before the Randomization Visit. A complete remission is defined as the&#xD;
        disappearance of all signs of cancer in response to treatment.)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participant received a study intervention during the 30 days before Screening (Visit&#xD;
             1) or is planning to receive study intervention (other than that administered during&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Participant's parent/guardian/LAR or caregiver has been directly or indirectly&#xD;
             involved in the conduct and administration of this study as an investigator, study&#xD;

             parent/guardian/LAR or caregiver who has a first-degree family member, significant&#xD;
             other, or relative residing with him/her directly or indirectly who is involved in&#xD;
