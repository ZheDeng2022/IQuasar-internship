  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      With increased use of effective strategies to prevent HIV transmission from women to their&#xD;
      infants, the number of HIV infected children has dramatically decreased. This has led to an&#xD;
      increased number of children who have been exposed to HIV, but who are not themselves&#xD;
      infected. There is concern that exposure to HIV can lead to poorer health outcomes, including&#xD;
      less optimal neurodevelopment. Because of this possibility in a growing population of&#xD;
      HIV-exposed, but uninfected (HEU) children, there is a need to identify interventions to&#xD;
      optimize their growth and development. This study was undertaken to evaluate the impact of a&#xD;
      two-generation intervention, jointly targeting child neurodevelopment and maternal&#xD;
      psychosocial wellbeing, integrated into antenatal care/prevention of maternal to child&#xD;
      transmission (ANC/PMTCT) clinics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intervention was implemented by mothers2mothers (m2m), an organization based in South&#xD;
      Africa with a long-standing program using peer mentors (Mentor Mothers) to support&#xD;
      HIV-infected women and their families. The m2m ECD intervention provided by specially trained&#xD;
      Mentor Mothers included home- and community based activities meant to assist mothers and&#xD;
      other caregivers in building resilience and gaining skills to support their children's&#xD;
      development. The primary intervention was an intensive program of home visits beginning&#xD;
      during pregnancy and continuing until the child reached two years of age, with up to 46 home&#xD;
      visits. At each visit, the ECD Mentor Mothers helped parents/caregivers to learn about ages&#xD;
      and stages of growth (including pre-birth), and to facilitate responsive parenting and early&#xD;
      learning opportunities for their children. Mentor Mothers also conducted parenting&#xD;
      information play groups (PIPs) in each community for ECD clients and ECD information was&#xD;
      integrated into the existing facility support groups provided at each health clinic. The&#xD;
      intervention covered general areas of maternal and child health, nutrition, social services,&#xD;
      support for primary caregivers and stimulation for early learning.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since the intervention was targeted at two generations, the primary aims were two-fold: to&#xD;
      assess the impact on pediatric neurodevelopment and on maternal psychosocial function.&#xD;
      Secondary aims included assessment of maternal and child retention in care, maternal HIV&#xD;
      outcomes and child mortality, health, growth and nutrition. Children were enrolled into one&#xD;
      of two study arms: 1) the intervention arm included children from clinics where the m2m ECD&#xD;
      program was being implemented, and 2) the comparison arm included children from government&#xD;
      clinics that offered standard of care services but no m2m or ECD program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mothers were enrolled during antenatal care, in the third trimester of pregnancy. Children&#xD;
      and their mothers were followed though 18 months of age and their evaluation included an&#xD;
      assessment of development (Mullen Scale of Early Learning) at 9 and 18 months, as well as&#xD;
      assessments of child growth, maternal psychosocial well-being, parenting practices and&#xD;
      retention in care.&#xD;

      Intervention Methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      ECD Intervention. Mothers2mothers (m2m) was selected to pilot-test a parenting intervention&#xD;
      integrated within the Eswatini standard integrated antenatal care and PMTCT program developed&#xD;
      according to the World Health Organization (WHO) Option B+ recommendations. Each clinic&#xD;
      selected for the pilot test had already implemented a m2m mentor mother (MM) peer support&#xD;
      program at the facility, as well as defaulter follow-up in the community.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The parenting intervention strategy, known as &quot;uMntfwana Wami, uMntfwana Wetfu&quot;( &quot;My Child,&#xD;
      Our Child&quot;) was focused on peer support for pregnant women and parents/caregivers of young&#xD;
      children to assist them in building resilience and gaining skills to support their children's&#xD;
      development.&#xD;
&#xD;
      M2m's facility-based Mentor Mothers (MMs) recruited pregnant women at the ANC/PMTCT clinics.&#xD;
      Both HIV-positive and HIV-negative women were eligible to participate in the m2m&#xD;
      intervention. Community-based ECD MMs, who received five weeks of program-specific training,&#xD;
      provided the parental training intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evaluation Methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evaluation Design. The independent evaluation was designed as a quasi-experimental comparison&#xD;
      between clinic sites (and their surrounding communities) implementing the intervention and&#xD;
      similar clinic sites not implementing the intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size calculations. A sample size of 416 participants (213 intervention arm, 203&#xD;
      comparison arm) was estimated to be sufficient to detect a clinically meaningful difference&#xD;
      of 0.5 standard deviation (SD) on an age-normed Mullen scale, after allowing for potential&#xD;
      10% child mortality and 20% loss to follow-up, and accounting for clustering at the clinic&#xD;
      level.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Enrollment of participants. At intervention arm clinics, m2m facility MMs referred ANC&#xD;
      clients in the third trimester of pregnancy, residing in the clinic catchment area, and&#xD;
      interested in participating in both intervention and study to the study team. At comparison&#xD;
      arm clinics, nurses referred interested third trimester pregnant women to the study. A study&#xD;
      research assistant based at each clinic conducted eligibility screening and obtained informed&#xD;
      consent. Although women could participate in the parental training intervention irrespective&#xD;
      of HIV status, the evaluation was designed to assess its effect only on the HIV-positive&#xD;
      subgroup of mothers. Participant inclusion criteria were: a woman, aged at least 18, with&#xD;
      confirmed HIV-positive status recorded on a clinic chart or register, visiting the PMTCT&#xD;
      clinic in the 3rd trimester of pregnancy, and verified resident within the clinic-defined&#xD;
      catchment area. Participants who planned to move outside the catchment area or switch HIV&#xD;
      care to another site, did not provide written consent to participate in the study or did not&#xD;
      complete the enrollment questionnaire were excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection and follow up. Study participants were interviewed at enrollment to collect&#xD;
      demographic and contact information, abstract patient-held HIV and maternal health cards, and&#xD;
      carry out baseline assessments. Follow-up interviews and abstraction of the patient-held HIV,&#xD;
      maternal health and well child care cards were targeted for two weeks after the baby's birth&#xD;
      and when the baby reached three, six, nine and 18 months of age. A home visit and observation&#xD;
      were conducted when the baby was between 12-15 months of age. If the mother was not&#xD;
      reachable, the baby's primary caregiver was interviewed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary outcomes assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary pediatric outcome of cognitive development at nine and 18 months of age was&#xD;
      assessed using the Mullen Scales of Early Learning, administered by two assessors. The items&#xD;
      were translated into siSwati as needed and adapted for and tested on emaSwati children in the&#xD;
      relevant age groups. At the 18-month time point, inter-rater reliability was assessed by&#xD;
      independently scoring a sample of 40 children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary maternal outcome of psychosocial well-being was assessed using the Edinburgh&#xD;
      Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS), categorized dichotomously as depressive symptoms present&#xD;
      (EPDS score &gt;13) or absent (EPDS score ≤13). The cutoff was selected based on work in&#xD;
      neighboring South Africa by Tomlinson et al (2017). Parenting self-confidence was also&#xD;
      assessed, using the Maternal Self-Report Inventory (Short Form) (MSRI). These instruments&#xD;
      were administered to women at enrollment and at nine and 18 months postpartum.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcomes assessment. Length, weight, head circumference and mid-upper arm&#xD;
      circumference were measured at the child's 9- and 18-month visits and compared to norms&#xD;
      established by the WHO Multicentre Growth Reference Study..[ref 49]. Three separate&#xD;
      anthropometric measurements were taken and the median value used. Retention in care and&#xD;
      pediatric HIV testing was assessed based on health care visits and outcomes abstracted from&#xD;
      multiple sources including: participant-held maternal health/ANC and HIV cards and child&#xD;
      health and HIV cards, postnatal care and child welfare registers at the clinics, and the&#xD;
      client management information system (CMIS) in some clinics, as well as self-report.&#xD;
      Compliance with feeding recommendations was obtained by maternal or caregiver report.&#xD;
      Mortality information was obtained by report from families.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Potential mediators. Information on routine caregiving practices and household&#xD;
      characteristics was obtained by observation using the Home Observation for Measurement of the&#xD;
      Environment (HOME) Inventory [refs2 3] during a home visit at 12-15 months of age. Households&#xD;
      were instructed to carry out everyday household activities during this observation visit.&#xD;
      Study Research Assistants (RAs) completed classroom training on this instrument and then&#xD;
      pilot-tested it in the field using non-participating households. Inter-rater reliability was&#xD;
      assessed by having multiple observers score the pilot and then discuss discrepancies in&#xD;
      scoring. Key, non-routine child stimulation practices were assessed by interview using the&#xD;
      Family Care Indicator, a series of standardized questions developed as part of the UNICEF&#xD;
      Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys (MICS) version 3 (2006), which was administered at&#xD;
      baseline to all participating mothers who at the time had children under age five, and to all&#xD;
      mothers and caregivers at the 9-month and 18-month assessments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Potential confounding factors. Eswatini was affected by a drought during 2016-2017 and its&#xD;
      impact was assessed at home visits (age 12-15 months), and at the 18-month interview using&#xD;
      the Household Food Insecurity Access Scale (HFIAS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Contamination assessment. Participants in both arms were interviewed about their contact with&#xD;
      m2m at each visit and at the 18-month assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical methods.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mullen scores:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Scores from each domain (Visual Reception, Fine Motor skills, Receptive Language, Expressive&#xD;
      Language and Gross Motor skills) were analyzed separately. For each domain, the within-sample&#xD;
      means and standard deviations of the raw scores by arm were calculated. To facilitate&#xD;
      understanding of the effect sizes, the Mullen scores in each domain were then transformed&#xD;
      into within-study sample standardized scores (Z-scores), for which effect sizes represent&#xD;
      unit changes in the distribution SD. Multivariable linear mixed effects regression models&#xD;
      with a random effect for enrollment site were applied to test the difference in the&#xD;
      standardized mean scores between the two study arms at each time point. Adjusters selected&#xD;
      based on the literature included the child's actual age at the assessment date, the child's&#xD;
      gender, and an indicator for stunting (length-for-age Z-score &lt; 2) as a proxy for chronic&#xD;
      malnutrition. Additional adjusters were included in the multivariate model based on their&#xD;
      strong (p&lt;=0.2) effects in bivariate analyses: the size of the mother's household at&#xD;
      enrollment, the length of residence of the mother at her current location at enrollment,&#xD;
      household asset-based socio-economic status of the mother at enrollment, the mother's number&#xD;
      of other living children at enrollment, her number of previous miscarriages, and her years of&#xD;
      education.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Other measures. Growth: Percentages of children with Z-scores of the WHO-standardized&#xD;
      anthropometric measurements &lt; -2 at the 9 month and 18 month assessments were reported.&#xD;
      Maternal retention in HIV care: Time in care was calculated as days from the date of&#xD;
      enrollment in the study to the last documented visit as found in the patient-held HIV cards,&#xD;
      the chronic care file of the HIV clinic at the clinic where they enrolled, the CMIS and from&#xD;
      self-report. A log-rank test for equality of mean retention between the two arms was&#xD;
      conducted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Socio-economic status: Principal components analysis was used to develop a composite score of&#xD;
      socio-economic status based on reported household assets, which was divided into quintiles&#xD;
      for analysis. Family Care Indicator. Performance on individual items was assessed and as well&#xD;
      as through a combined score (possible range: 0-6) of activities that someone in the household&#xD;
      was reported to have performed with the child: (1) &quot;Read books or look at picture books&quot; (2)&#xD;
      &quot;Sing songs&quot; (3) &quot;Tell stories&quot; (4) &quot;Play with&quot; (5) &quot;Take [the child] outside the home,&#xD;
      compound, yard or enclosure&quot; and (6) spend time naming, counting and/or drawing things.&quot;&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mediation analysis. The multivariable linear regression model used in the primary analysis of&#xD;
      the 18-month timepoint was extended into a generalized structural equation model to evaluate&#xD;
      a potential mediating effect of book-sharing with the child on the relationships between&#xD;
      study arm and expressive language scores, and between study arm and visual reception scores.&#xD;
      Robust variance estimation was used to adjust for site clustering The presence of book&#xD;
      sharing was defined as a positive response to item (1) on the Family Care Indicator at the 18&#xD;
      month timepoint.&#xD;
