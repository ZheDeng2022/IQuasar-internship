      The first objective is to investigate the effect of boba pearls made from different starches&#xD;
      on glycaemia, insulinaemia and appetite control. The second objective is to investigate the&#xD;
      effects of various sugar blends of sucrose with sugar substitutes in milk tea on glycaemia,&#xD;
      insulinaemia and appetite control.&#xD;

      Design: There are two parts to this study. Participants will voluntarily choose to&#xD;
      participate in either one or both parts of the study during the first screening session. Part&#xD;
      A: Testing the effects of boba pearls using different starches. Part B: Testing the effects&#xD;
      of milk-based tea with different sugar blends of sucrose with sugar substitutes with a&#xD;
      standard type of boba pearl&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both parts of the study will have a randomized, nonblinded, crossover design. Screening will&#xD;
      occur before the study commences. Participants will be asked to return on four&#xD;
      non-consecutive days (Part A) and two-three non-consecutive days (Part B) with a wash out&#xD;
      period of at least 2 days to avoid crossover effects. In both parts of the study, the test&#xD;
      foods will be consumed with a carbohydrate-based food (for example: bread, biscuit etc.)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study protocol Screening session: All potential participants will be asked to attend one&#xD;
      screening session to ensure they are eligible to be enrolled into the study. After which,&#xD;
      they will attend either four test sessions (Part A) and/or two-three test sessions (Part B).&#xD;
      If the participant participates in Part A of the study, they will only be required to attend&#xD;
      two test sessions in Part B as they would have completed the control session in Part A. If&#xD;
      participants decide to participate only in Part B of the study, they will have to complete&#xD;
      three test sessions. During the first screening session, participants will receive an&#xD;
      informed consent form and be given ample time to go through it and rectify any queries they&#xD;
      have. If they decide to take part in the study, they will be asked to sign the informed&#xD;
      consent form. They will then be asked to complete a screening questionnaire, baseline&#xD;
      measurements including anthropometric measurements, blood pressure, and fasting blood glucose&#xD;
      will be collected from each participant in order to determine their eligibility. During the&#xD;
      test sessions, participants' glycaemic, insulinaemic and appetite responses to the test meals&#xD;
      will be measured. The test duration for each session will be 4 hours. Participants will be&#xD;
      instructed to avoid strenuous physical activity for at least 3 days and avoid caffeine and&#xD;
      alcohol consumption for at least 1 day prior to visiting the CNRC for their study trials.&#xD;
      Participants will be provided with a standardised dinner meal (consisting of rice/noodles,&#xD;
      vegetables, meat, drink/pudding) and asked to refrain from alcohol and exercise the day&#xD;
      before their testing sessions. Screening questionnaire: The screening questionnaire will&#xD;
      include contact information, demographic and general health details. This information will be&#xD;
      used to determine whether the participant is eligible for the study, as well as to check for&#xD;
      any possible confounders that may influence the study outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anthropometric measurements: Body weight and body composition will be measured using&#xD;
      bioelectrical impedance analysis. Height will be measured using a stadiometer in order to&#xD;
      calculate participants' BMI. Blood pressure will also be measured. All measurements will be&#xD;
      taken in duplicate during the screening session. Waist circumference will be measured at the&#xD;
      minimum circumference between the iliac crest and the rib cage. Hip circumference will be&#xD;
      measured at the maximum protuberance of the buttocks. Biceps and triceps skinfold&#xD;
      measurements will also be taken. Blood pressure will be measured using an Omron blood&#xD;
      pressure monitor (Model HEM-907) at baseline. Participants will be seated for five minutes&#xD;
      before blood pressure is measured. Measurements will be taken in duplicate and the averaged&#xD;
      results will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood collection: Participants will be asked to attend the testing sessions after an&#xD;
      overnight fast of ten hours. After a 15-minute rest period, they will have a cannula inserted&#xD;
      in their arm to obtain blood samples at regular intervals. One fasting blood sample will be&#xD;
      collected by venous cannulation. 3 millilitres (ml) of venous blood will be collected into&#xD;
      VacutainersÂ® (Belton Dickinson Diagnostics) containing disodium EDTA for the analyses of&#xD;
      plasma glucose, insulin concentrations. Participants will then consume treatment meal&#xD;
      within15 minutes. Blood samples will be taken at 15, 30, 45, 60, 90, 120, 150 and 180&#xD;
      minutes. The amount of blood that will be collected at every time point will be about 0.6&#xD;
      teaspoon of blood (approximately 3 ml). The accumulative amount per test session will not be&#xD;
      more than 5.4 teaspoons of blood (approximately 27 ml), and the accumulative amount for the&#xD;
      entire study duration will be approximately 108ml of blood for Part A and for Part B, 81ml of&#xD;
      blood (3 test sessions) or 54ml of blood (2 test sessions). The blood samples collected at&#xD;
      each time point will be measured for glucose and insulin. Glycaemic and insulinaemic&#xD;
      responses will be determined using the method described by Wolever and Jenkins. The area&#xD;
      under the curve will be determined as the area of those increments above baseline only.&#xD;
      Metabolic satiety: At the same time intervals, the participants will be instructed to fill in&#xD;
      visual analogue scale (VAS) on feelings of fullness, hunger, desire to eat and prospective&#xD;
      food consumption. VAS are 100 mm continuous lines anchored with opposing answers to a&#xD;
      specific question asked either on a computer or on a hard copy. The specific questions asked&#xD;
      will be, 'How hungry do you feel?', 'How full do you feel?', 'How strong is your desire to&#xD;
      eat?', 'How much more food do you think you can eat?'. The participants will be instructed to&#xD;
      make a mark on the line which corresponds with their subjective feeling. Only for Part A of&#xD;
      the study, upon completion of the blood collection and before lunch, participants will be&#xD;
      asked to drink a mouthful of the bubble tea with pearls (standardised serving size) and to&#xD;
      masticate the boba pearls as they would naturally do. They will be asked to raise their hands&#xD;
      once they swallow the pearls. The researcher would have counted the number of chews (x chews)&#xD;
      to reach the swallow point (when participants raise their hands). Participants will be asked&#xD;
      to rinse their mouth, have the second mouthful and chew x times before expectorating the&#xD;
      bolus for particle size analysis. Three replicates will be collected. Boluses will be placed&#xD;
      in a petri dish and suspended in distilled water to separate the particles before an image is&#xD;
      captured for image analysis. Samples will be discarded upon completion of image analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Test session: Participants will be provided a standard dinner meal to be consumed at home at&#xD;
      7pm the night before the test session on the day of screening for the first session. For&#xD;
      subsequent sessions, all standard dinners will be provided on the last day of each session to&#xD;
      be eaten before the next session. The foods are frozen dinners and can be stored in the&#xD;
      freezer and then reheated to be consumed before the next session. After which, they will be&#xD;
      asked to not eat and drink anything except water after 10:30 pm. They will also be instructed&#xD;
      to arrive at the CNRC the following morning after an overnight fast of 10-12 hours. After 15&#xD;
      minutes upon arrival, an indwelling catheter will be inserted into a vein in your forearm and&#xD;
      will be kept patent (free of clots) for the remainder of the test session. We will then take&#xD;
      a blood sample from the cannula to measure baseline values. After obtaining the baseline&#xD;
      blood samples, participants will be given the test meal to consume within 15 minutes.&#xD;
      Following the test meal, we will take further blood samples (from the cannula) for the next&#xD;
      15, 30, 45, 60, 90, 120, 150 and 180 minutes. Participants will also be asked to complete the&#xD;
      VAS following the same time points from baseline to 180 minutes. After 3 hours, the cannula&#xD;
      will be removed and for Part A of the study, participants will be instructed to masticate&#xD;
      boba pearls and the number of chews to reach swallow point will be recorded. Boluses of the&#xD;
      pearls will be collected and kept for analysis. For both Part A and B, they will then be&#xD;
      asked to consume an ad libitum lunch until they are comfortably full. At the end of the ad&#xD;
      libitum lunch, participants will be asked to complete a final VAS for the measurement of&#xD;
      hunger and feelings of fullness. After which, they are free to leave CNRC. During the entire&#xD;
      testing period the participants will be instructed to remain rested and in the laboratory.&#xD;
      There will be no incidental findings as analysed samples are basic metabolites and therefore,&#xD;
      reporting is not applicable.&#xD;
