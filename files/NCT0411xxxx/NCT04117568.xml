      Surgical trauma elicits an immune response aiming to initiate healing and remove debris and&#xD;
      damaged tissue locally at the wound site (1). This local reaction includes a considerable&#xD;
      production of cytokines and chemokines that enters the circulation and initiate a systemic&#xD;
      inflammatory response mediated by circulating cytokines and chemokines. This response is&#xD;
      called systemic inflammatory immune response (SIRS) and is an aseptic systemic inflammation.&#xD;
      Postoperative inflammation produces proinflammatory cytokines, mainly IL-6, IL1 beta, and&#xD;
      tumor necrosis factor alfa (2). Neutrophils and emergency granulopoesis Polymorphonuclear&#xD;
      neutrophils constitute the most abundant population of white blood cells. Their main task is&#xD;
      to provide innate immune protection of the host from microbial attack, migrating to the site&#xD;
      of infection, engulfing the microbes by phagocytosis, and killing the prey through attack by&#xD;
      reactive oxygen species (ROS) and antimicrobial granule pro¬teins (22). Upon systemic&#xD;
      infection or inflammation, e.g., sepsis or trauma, the bone marrow enters a state of&#xD;
      emergency granulopoiesis, drenched in cytokines that augment production and survival of&#xD;
      neutrophils for rapid delivery to the blood (23-25). Recently, advanced techniques have&#xD;
      evolved that al¬low the isolation of different developmental stages of steady-state and&#xD;
      emergency neutrophils, and characterization of these has just begun (26). Glycans Glycans&#xD;
      (polysaccharides) attached to proteins and lipids on the surfaces on immune cells serve as&#xD;
      ligands for glycan-binding proteins, lectins. Several neutrophil processes are directed by&#xD;
      gly¬can - lectin interactions; selectin-directed rolling on the endothelium, siglec-mediated&#xD;
      in¬hibitory signals, and activation of effector function by galectins. Many of the proteins&#xD;
      that end up in neutrophil intra-cellular granules are highly glycosylated, but not much is&#xD;
      known about if and how the neutrophil glycome evolves during the 'targeting-by-timing'&#xD;
      process of differentiation and how this is affected by emergency granulopoiesis during&#xD;
      systemic infection and inflammation. Here is a clear knowledge gap.&#xD;

      Postoperative complications of any sort occurs in many of the patients undergoing high risk&#xD;
      cancer surgery such as surgery for pancreatic, esophageal or ovarian malignancy (3, 4) These&#xD;
      patients have a risk of wound infection mainly due to malnutrition and challenging surgical&#xD;
      conditions (5, 6) A prolonged inflammatory response (overshoot) in some patients may lead to&#xD;
      multiple organ failure (MOF) (7, 8).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Postoperative immunosuppression However, to handle the postoperative proinflammatory actions,&#xD;
      patients also produce anti-inflammatory cytokines, mainly IL-4, IL-10 and IL-1 Ra. This is&#xD;
      called compensatory inflammatory response syndrome (CARS). In cases of complications or&#xD;
      malnutrition there may instead be an overshoot of the CARS mechanisms that lead to a&#xD;
      suppression of the immune response (9, 10).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The surgical stress resulting in an imbalance in the inflammatory systems consume the&#xD;
      circulating neutrophils and stresses the bone marrow to release immature, less efficient&#xD;
      neutrophils, into the bloodstream, an event called emergency granulopoesis(11, 12).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sepsis and ARDS Sepsis is one of the leading causes of death in Sweden and globally, and is&#xD;
      characterized by an uncontrolled inflammatory reaction (13). The disease can affect everyone,&#xD;
      including previously healthy people, and occurs when a normal bacterial infection invades the&#xD;
      bloodstream and the body then responds with an inflammatory reaction. Acute organ dysfunction&#xD;
      in sepsis primarily affects respiratory and circulatory systems (14). Pneumonia is the most&#xD;
      common underlying cause of sepsis and respiratory insufficiency is the most common organ&#xD;
      dysfunction in septic shock (15). Pneumonia with septic shock can develop into respiratory&#xD;
      distress syndrome (ARDS) associated with a very high mortality rate, around 40% (16-18)&#xD;
      Recently, ARDS was shown to be associated with migration of neutrophils, into the lung&#xD;
      alveoli, and that such infiltration drives an inflammatory reaction, for which the&#xD;
      pathophysiological mechanisms are incompletely mapped. Increased knowledge of the neutrophil&#xD;
      role in ARDS could thus benefit the understanding of this complex syndrome(19, 20). In&#xD;
      sepsis, the demand for enough circulating neutrophils to fight the infection is so high that&#xD;
      reserve pools are exhausted and granulopoiesis switches to emergency mode. This results in&#xD;
      release of immature neutrophils into circulation, the so-called left shift, used as an&#xD;
      indicator of sepsis. As a result, circulating neutrophils in sepsis can be very&#xD;
      heterogeneous, an effect also seen in autoimmune diseases and cancer (21). There are&#xD;
      currently no tools to properly investigate these emergency neutrophil populations to utilize&#xD;
      for diagnosis and disease follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Neutrophils and emergency granulopoesis Polymorphonuclear neutrophils constitute the most&#xD;
      abundant population of white blood cells. Their main task is to provide innate immune&#xD;
      protection of the host from microbial attack, migrating to the site of infection, engulfing&#xD;

      in cytokines that augment production and survival of neutrophils for rapid delivery to the&#xD;

      infection and inflammation. Here is a clear knowledge gap.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Settings, research designs, patients and methods This project is a collaboration between the&#xD;
      Sahlgrenska University Hospital, and Gothenburg University, Gothenburg, Sweden.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adult patients (&gt;18 years of age) are found from the surgical waiting list at the Sahlgrenska&#xD;
      University hospital as they are assessed and scheduled for surgery for different kinds of&#xD;
      malignancies, pancreatic malignancy, esophageal malignancy and ovarian malignancy.&#xD;
      Furthermore, in a second study we will include patients undergoing cardiac surgery, with a&#xD;
      heart lung machine in operation during the surgery. These patients will also be included from&#xD;
      the surgical waiting list.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients in septic shock will be included from daily rounds at the central intensive care&#xD;
      unit at the Sahlgrenska university Hospital. Septic shock is defined by criteria from&#xD;
      Surviving sepsis campaign or sepsis III. As only around 30% of patients that are diagnosed&#xD;
      with septic shock has a positive blood culture we will include both patients with or without&#xD;
      a positive blood culture. After obtaining informed consent, patients will leave venous blood&#xD;
      samples 3-5 times during their admission. The rationale for this was that we are not entirely&#xD;
      sure of when patients may or may not enter the stage of emergency granulopoesis, but based on&#xD;
      results from previous studies, and to achieve reasonable feasibility of the study protocol&#xD;
      with as little missing data as possible these three sampling occasions seemed a reasonable&#xD;
      compromise.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical significance The basic characterization of glycome and glycoproteome in neutrophil&#xD;
      granules will give in¬sights into, and be correlated with, the glycoconjugate status in the&#xD;
      cell precursor populations that may be prematurely released from the bone marrow upon&#xD;
      emergency granulopoiesis in¬duced by disease, such as sepsis, severe aseptic inflammation&#xD;
      (trauma), autoimmune disease and cancer. Hence, our studies of neutrophils from blood and&#xD;
      bone marrow, as well as emergency neutrophils from patients with sepsis and corresponding&#xD;
      model systems will enable us not only to build mechanistic models and glycan databases, but&#xD;
      also to develop novel diagnostic tools to identify and monitor disease. Here, our primary&#xD;
      focus is sepsis and the subsequent development of ARDS. In ARDS neutrophils migrate into the&#xD;
      alveoli of the lungs and degranulate in order to kill off bacteria. However, in the process&#xD;
      lung tissue is injured and the inflammatory process causing severe hypoxemia and life&#xD;
      threatening respiratory failure is fueled-on. As the glycome and glycoproteome seems to play&#xD;
      a role in discriminating between harmful bacteria and endogenous structures it is of&#xD;
      importance to clarify if there is any possible interactions that could be made to control&#xD;
      this part of the destructive inflammation.&#xD;
