  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Anticoagulant therapy is indicated during pregnancy for the prevention and treatment of&#xD;
      venous thromboembolism, systemic embolism in patients with mechanical heart valves and, in&#xD;
      combination with aspirin, for the prevention of recurrent pregnancy loss in women with&#xD;
      antiphospholipid antibodies Sildenafil citrate increases uterine blood flow and potentiates&#xD;
      estrogen-induced vasodilatation. Intravaginal administration of Sildenafil in the success of&#xD;
      in vitro fertilization describes no deleterious effects on mother and fetus&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Pregnancy is considered an acquired hypercoagulable state due to increased concentration of&#xD;
      coagulation factors, decreased levels of anticoagulants and decreased fibrinolytic capacity.&#xD;
      Adverse pregnancy outcomes affect up to 15% of gestations and are the major cause of maternal&#xD;
      and fetal morbidity and mortality. A poor perinatal outcome is expected in pregnancies with&#xD;
      high vascular resistance in uterine circulation, but the pregnancies in which the resistance&#xD;
      values are normalized in the later trimesters have a significantly better outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the prevention of fetal growth restriction, a recent large-study level meta-analysis and&#xD;
      individual patient data meta-analysis confirm that aspirin modestly reduces&#xD;
      small-for-gestational-age pregnancy in women at high risk (relative risk, 0.90, 95%&#xD;
      confidence interval, 0.81-1.00) and that a dose of â‰¥100 mg should be recommended and to start&#xD;
      at or before 16 weeks of gestation. Moreover, in vitro and in vivo studies suggest that&#xD;
      low-molecular-weight heparin may prevent fetal growth restriction; however, evidence from&#xD;
      randomized control trials is inconsistent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a normal pregnancy, the trophoblast produces nitric oxide (NO) which plays an important&#xD;
      role in vasodilatation in the fetoplacental circulation to improve oxygen and nutritional&#xD;
      supply to the fetus (9,10). Nitric oxide relaxes arterial and venous smooth muscle potently&#xD;
      and might inhibit platelet aggregation and adhesion. Moreover, increased circulating&#xD;
      phosphodiesterase (PDE) activity is suspected in women with preeclampsia. In pregnancies with&#xD;
      fetal growth restriction and without preeclampsia, a reversible increased myometrial arterial&#xD;
      tone by phosphodiesterase inhibition has been reported in vitro.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors that potentiate nitric oxide availability such as&#xD;
      sildenafil citrate have been extensively researched both in preclinical and clinical studies;&#xD;
      Sildenafil citrate is a selective inhibitor of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP)-specific&#xD;
      phosphodiesterase (PDE)-5 leading to cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) accumulation and&#xD;
      enhances the relaxation elicited by exogenous and neural-released nitric oxide in corpus&#xD;
      cavernous. Sildenafil citrate increases uterine blood flow and potentiates estrogen-induced&#xD;
      vasodilatation. Intravaginal administration of Sildenafil in the success of in vitro&#xD;
      fertilization describes no deleterious effects on mother and fetus. The Natural Killer Cells&#xD;
      activity and endometrial thickness were significantly changed after vaginal Sildenafil&#xD;
      therapy so it might be an interesting therapeutic option before conception in women with&#xD;
      recurrent reproductive failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Reduced flow / increased resistance in uterine and umbilical arteries, indicative of reduced&#xD;
      uteroplacental flow in pregnancies with fetal growth restriction, has been documented by&#xD;
      non-invasive Doppler ultrasound velocimetry.&#xD;
