  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Recent policy from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) mandates that&#xD;
      all public housing units go smoke-free by August 2018. Residents in public housing units have&#xD;
      little access to proven cessation interventions and support is imperative to increase&#xD;
      quitting success and is currently lacking in these communities;' thus this mandate is causing&#xD;
      stress without providing resources to quit. Using a Community Engaged Research (CEnR)&#xD;
      approach, we propose to partner the Durham County Department of Public Health and the Durham&#xD;
      Housing Authority to develop sustainable Community Health Advisor tobacco cessation program&#xD;
      that can be implemented in public housing communities. To achieve this goal, we plan to build&#xD;
      on our previous collaborations to 1) form a team of previously identified DHA residents who&#xD;
      are activated to support smoking cessation among public housing residents who can serve as&#xD;
      Community Health Advisors and deliver cessation interventions in DHA properties, and 2)&#xD;
      co-develop and pilot test a Community Health Advisor smoking cessation program to promote&#xD;
      linkages with cessation services and to provide cessation education to DHA residents. This&#xD;
      collaboration builds on our previous work to understand barriers and identify solutions for&#xD;
      supporting smoking cessation among DHA residents. We will work with Community Health Advisors&#xD;
      to develop an intervention and conduct a pilot study with up to 30 participants, Our primary&#xD;
      outcomes are feasibility and acceptability of the co-development cessation intervention. We&#xD;
      will collect survey data for the pilot in REDCap. Potential risks of study participation&#xD;
      include breach of confidentiality with regard to identifiable personal information and&#xD;
      questions that might make participants feel uncomfortable.&#xD;

    <description>CHAs meet with all interested residents to discuss taking steps towards quitting. The CHAs follow a four step program with all participant 1) get to know the resident and their smoking, 2) Assess what the resident is ready to do to take steps towards quitting, 3) discuss using nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) in the form of patches, gum or lozenges, 4) set one goal for taking steps towards quitting. CHAs will attempt to follow up with participants after the initial encounter. There is no limit on the number of times the CHA may talk with the participants. Some follow interactions will be brief encounters in the neighborhood, while others will be at scheduled. All contacts with each participant will be tracked.&#xD;
We will provide up to 6 weeks of NRT patches, gum and lozenges to participants who are interested in using NRT to help them quit.</description>
