  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, dose-escalation study to evaluate the safety, tolerability,&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of a single dose of MT1002 for injection following&#xD;
      intravenous bolus/infusion ascending dose administration.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A total of 36 subjects (6 subjects per cohort) in 6 dose levels . At each dose level, a&#xD;
      single sentinel subject will be dosed first. Sentinel subjects will receive a phone call at&#xD;
      48 hours ±4 hours to inquire about their status. If no dose-limiting toxicity is observed for&#xD;
      48 hours post-dose, the remaining 5 subjects in that dose level will be treated.&#xD;
