  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In prostate cancer bone is the most common site for cancer spread, causing pain, fractures,&#xD;
      nerve compression and death.&#xD;
&#xD;
      New therapies are available for treating bone disease from cancer and this means that by&#xD;
      maintaining patients on drugs that are effective and switching patients to other drugs when&#xD;
      current treatment becomes ineffective, patients can be maintained 'better for longer'.&#xD;
      However, to do this, it is necessary to accurately tell whether a given treatment is working&#xD;
      or not.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, the investigators will perform whole body MRI scans, which include a special&#xD;
      scan called diffusion-weighted MRI (DWI MRI) that can provide more information about the&#xD;
      participants extent of disease. The investigators aim to show that this test is better than&#xD;
      the standard tests of CT and bone scan currently used in the NHS to monitor bone disease. The&#xD;
      information from this study will be used to test a special software so that the test may more&#xD;
      widely benefit patients across the NHS in the future.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In patients with prostate cancer the current methods to assess treatment response of bone&#xD;
      disease such as computer tomography (CT) and bone scan (BS)are unreliable, insensitive to&#xD;
      bone disease and have limited criteria to assess disease response confined to bones. Blood&#xD;
      tests are inaccurate although some newer tests (e.g. circulating tumour cells tests) show&#xD;
      promise but are still under investigation and nuclear medicine investigations such as PET/CT&#xD;
      imaging have higher sensitivity, meaning they can detect more sites of disease who are indeed&#xD;
      disease than CT or BS but they are more costly and less widely available compared with MRI&#xD;
      within the NHS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For this study the Whole body MRI (WB-MRI) includes a measurement called diffusion-weighted&#xD;
      imaging (DWI) which is relatively new and has a high sensitivity for bone metastases. This&#xD;
      technique can be used to measure total bone disease volume (TDV) and the disease apparent&#xD;
      diffusion coefficient (ADC) which reflects the tumour tissue cell density. Previous studies&#xD;
      have shown good reproducibility of both these measurements and a significant increase in the&#xD;
      mean tumour ADC is observed in patients who are responding to effective treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However WB-MRI application across the NHS is ad-hoc, CT and BS techniques are entrenched&#xD;
      within clinical practice despite their known limitations. Another factor that limits wider&#xD;
      adoption of WB-MRI is the lack of sophisticated analysis software to enable disease across&#xD;
      the body to be quickly evaluated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This multi-centre imaging study will provide the opportunity to evaluate the performance of&#xD;
      WB-MRI with a novel software diagnostics for evaluating the treatment response of advanced&#xD;
      prostate cancer patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This prototype can used to evaluate WB-MRI data from different scanners and address a current&#xD;
      major unmet need for the treatment and follow-up of patients with bone disease from cancers,&#xD;
      so that the test may more widely benefit patients across the NHS in the future.&#xD;
