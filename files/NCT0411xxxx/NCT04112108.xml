      This research was designed as single-technique (Inoue balloon), multicenter retrospective-&#xD;
      prospective cohort study. The target group of this study consisted of 220 patients with&#xD;
      symptomatic MS who had undergone PTMC at in 4 hospitals (Baqiyatallah, Namazi, Shahid-Faghihi&#xD;
      and Kowsar) under the supervision of Baqiyatallah University of Medical Sciences and Shiraz&#xD;
      University of Medical Sciences between April 2006 and January 2018. The demographic data of&#xD;
      the patients were obtained from the medical records departments at each center.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The inclusion criteria for the participants were: 1) age more than 20 years at the time of&#xD;
      PTMC; 2) immediate post-PTMC mitral valve area (IMVA) ≥1.5 cm2, or for lower values, at least&#xD;
      50% increase in pre-PTMC mitral valve area (MVA); 3) an initial cardiovascular event-free&#xD;
      period of at least 6 months after the procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The exclusion criteria consisted of: 1) more than 2+ mitral regurgitation (MR) immediately&#xD;
      after the procedure; 2) immediate cardiovascular event during the hospital stay after the&#xD;
      procedure; 3) more than mild aortic stenosis or sufficiency before PTMC; 4) history of&#xD;
      previous PTMC or surgical mitral procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study design and steps were approved by the ethics committees at both Baqiyatallah and&#xD;
      Shiraz University of Medical Sciences.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PTMC Technique All PTMC procedures were done with an Inoue balloon catheter by skilled&#xD;
      interventional cardiologists via anterograde trans-septal approach in all patients. Right and&#xD;
      left cardiac catheterization was performed before and during the procedure to assess&#xD;
      hemodynamic changes. Optimal balloon size (in millimeters) was estimated with the height&#xD;
      (cm)/10 + 10 formula. The balloon was inflated in a step-wise fashion from lower to higher&#xD;
      volumes. After each inflation, changes in trans-mitral mean pressure gradient (TMPG) and the&#xD;
      degree of mitral regurgitation (MR) were monitored. Based on interventionist's judgement and&#xD;
      in order to achieve optimal results, balloon inflation could be continued up to 1-2 mm more&#xD;
      than the estimated size. In the last stage, left ventriculography was conducted to assess the&#xD;
      degree of final MR.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Echocardiography All the patient included underwent transthoracic Doppler echocardiography&#xD;
      (TTE) in the week before PTMC by expert cardiologists with an advanced echocardiography&#xD;
      fellowship. All general echocardiographic findings and significant mitral valve-related&#xD;
      characteristics were reported. MVA was measured by planimetry in the short axis view, and&#xD;
      also by pressure half-time quantification when atrial fibrillation (AF) or MR were not&#xD;
      serious enough to interfere with its interpretation. The degree of MR was reported on a&#xD;
      semi-quantitative scale of 0 to 4 based on Doppler color flow mapping. Mitral valve&#xD;
      morphology was also evaluated with the standard Wilkins echocardiographic scoring system in&#xD;
      the spectrum of 4 to 16. Pulmonary arterial pressure was estimated by measuring systolic&#xD;
      pulmonary arterial pressure (sPAP) in mmHg based on the trans-tricuspid regurgitation jet.&#xD;
      Other significant variables in this study were left atrial diameter in centimeters, and mean&#xD;
      trans-mitral pressure gradient (TMPG) in mmHg.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each patient also had one session of transesophageal echocardiography during the day before&#xD;
      the procedure in order to rule out thrombi in the left atrium or the left atrial appendage.&#xD;
      Another session of TTE was performed during the first day after the procedure to confirm the&#xD;
      immediate success of PTMC, with the main focus on mitral valve-related parameters, and also&#xD;
      to rule out acute complications such as severe MR or cardiac tamponade.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up The clinical condition of the patients was recorded as their New York Heart&#xD;
      Association (NYHA) functional class before the procedure. Their clinical status was also&#xD;
      followed in their inpatient and outpatient records. For the purpose of this study, the&#xD;
      patients or their first-degree relatives were contacted by telephone in order to record the&#xD;
      occurrence and exact timing of any adverse cardiac events, and also to reassess their current&#xD;
      NYHA functional class status. Clinical events considered significant for the purpose of this&#xD;
      study included: 1) cardiac-related death, 2) another session of PTMC, or 3) surgical&#xD;
      procedure of mitral valve replacement (MVR). Patients who had been event-free until that time&#xD;
      were asked to undergo another TTE evaluation after providing their informed consent, in order&#xD;
      to compare the echocardiographic variables noted above with their previous records.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis Continuous variables are reported as the mean ± SD. Categorical and&#xD;
      nominal variables are shown as the number and percentage, and were pooled in some cases in&#xD;
      order to facilitate the interpretation of the results. Initially, univariate Cox proportional&#xD;
      hazards regression analysis was used to assess the relationship between variables and adverse&#xD;
      cardiac events at follow-up. In the next stage, Cox multivariable regression was also&#xD;
      performed to single out the independent variables. To evaluate the variables for the&#xD;
      occurrence of restenosis during follow-up, uni- and multivariate logistic regression analysis&#xD;
      was used. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were generated to determine the best&#xD;
      cut-off point for IMVA in interpreting the results. For all analyses a p-value of 0.05 or&#xD;
      less was considered statistically significant. All data analyses were done with IBM SPSS&#xD;
      Statistics version 23 software.&#xD;
