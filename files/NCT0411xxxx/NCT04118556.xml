      Main inclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adult patients (age ≥ 18 years) with steroid refractory (SR) acute GvHD (aGVHD) grades II-IV&#xD;
      after allo-HSCT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Signed written study informed consent once SR-aGvHD is confirmed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main exclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Presence of an active uncontrolled infection requiring treatment. Has received systemic&#xD;
      treatment for aGvHD apart from steroids. Clinical presentation resembling de novo chronic&#xD;
      GvHD or GvHD overlap syndrome. Known human immunodeficiency virus infection (HIV). Patients&#xD;
      suffering on active tuberculosis or viral hepatitis. Significant respiratory disease Presence&#xD;
      of severely impaired renal function Patients with coagulopathy Pregnant or nursing&#xD;
      (lactating) women Malignancy that has required treatment in the previous two years Any&#xD;
      condition that would, in the Investigator's judgment, interfere with full participation in&#xD;
      the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a phase I/II, multicenter, open-label trial of DSC in patients with steroid&#xD;
      refractory acute GvHD grades II-IV.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The trial will consist of 2 main parts: Phase 1 (open, non-randomized, 3+3 DSC dose&#xD;
      escalating scheme), and Phase II, randomized (1:1), open label study investigating the&#xD;
      efficacy and safety of DSC vs. BAT added to the patient's immunosuppressive regimen in adults&#xD;
      with SR-aGvHD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase I dose escalating study. The main objective of the first part of the study is safety&#xD;
      and tolerability of two different doses of DSC and to establish the optimal dose for the&#xD;
      second, Phase II, part of the study. Six patients will be enrolled, 3 patients given the&#xD;
      lower dose (1x10^6 DSC/kg) and 3 patients given the higher dose (3x10^6 DSC/kg). Patients&#xD;
      will receive 2 doses of DSC (low or high) one week apart. If none of the initial 3 patients&#xD;
      in the low-dose cohort experience a Severe Adverse Event (SAE), enrolment into the high dose&#xD;
      level will commence. If the low and high dose in the Phase I study show similar safety&#xD;
      results, the lower dose will be chosen for the Phase II, randomized study. The reason for the&#xD;
      chosen doses in the phase I part is that in the pilot study, 1x10^6/kg showed very promising&#xD;
      clinical results without any significant side-effects. The higher dose is chosen as this is&#xD;
      the highest dose used clinically without any severe side-effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The dose proposed for cohort 2 may change pending review of the data from the previous cohort&#xD;
      by the Safety committee.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the second part of the study (Phase II) primary objectives will be safety and to compare&#xD;
      durable overall response (DOR) at 56 days after randomization between patients receiving DSC&#xD;
      with patients receiving BAT as treatment for SR acute GvHD grades II-IV. Target enrollment is&#xD;
      50 patients, 25 in the DSC treatment-arm and 25 in the BAT arm. Patients will be given the&#xD;
      optimal dose of DSC from the Phase I, dose escalating part of the study, as mentioned above.&#xD;
      At least 2 doses of DSC will be given one week apart. Additional doses of DSC (maximum 6&#xD;
      doses) may be given depending on response. Additional doses (beyond the first 2 doses) may be&#xD;
      given one week apart until response, or whenever needed if aGVHD flare occur within 6 months&#xD;
      after randomization (EOT).&#xD;
&#xD;
      BAT: Investigator's choice Best Available Therapy (BAT) will vary depending upon&#xD;
      Investigator's choice identified prior to randomization. Dose and frequency will depend on&#xD;
      label (where approved) and institutional guidelines for various BAT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objective&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the phase I part:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Assess the safety and tolerability profile of DSC&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Select the recommended DSC dose for the phase II study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the phase II part:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Assess the Safety of DSC.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Durable Overall Response (DOR) at Day 56.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess Overall Response Rate (ORR) at day 28&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess 1-year Overall Survival (OS)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess 1-year Non-Relapse Mortality (NRM)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess incidence of infections&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exploratory objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the cumulative steroid dose until Day 56 and Day 90&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess Event-Free Survival (EFS)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess incidence of Malignancy Relapse/Progression&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To measure the incidence of chronic GvHD&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To measure immune reconstitution&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate changes in Patient Reported Outcomes&#xD;

The FACT-BMT (Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Bone Marrow Transplant) has a total of 50 questions. This is a questionnaire of general questions divided into four primary quality of life domains: physical well-being (PWB; 7-items), social/family well-being (SWB; 7-items), emotional well-being (EWB; 6-items); and functional well-being (FWB; 7-items), 18 items address the BMT related side effects, specifically designed to assess the BMT patients' quality of life. Five other questions from different QoL questionnaire were added as they were considered relevant to FACT-BMT.</description>

The product consists of a viable allogeneic DSCs frozen in 5% of human serum albumin (HSA) in sodium chloride (NaCl) 0.9% and 10% dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO), that is thawed and immediately diluted in 40 mL sodium chloride (NaCl) 0.9% prior to infusion. That will give a final concentration of 2.2% HSA and 2% DMSO.&#xD;
DSC will be infused when steroid-refractory acute GVHD after allogenic stem-cell transplantation has been diagnosed. Two doses, one week apart, will be given to all patients. Additional doses will be used depending on response.</description>
