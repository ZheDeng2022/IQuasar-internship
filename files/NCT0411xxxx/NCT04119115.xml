      The purpose of this study is to find out if combining a state-of-the-art form imaging&#xD;
      modality with metabolomics in different types of Interstitial Lung Diseases (ILD) patients&#xD;
      compared to controls with chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder (COPD)/emphysema and healthy&#xD;
      controls will be a better predictor of disease progression. ILD's are a group of chronic,&#xD;
      progressive lung diseases. The most common ILD is idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF).&#xD;
      Metabolomics provides a &quot;snapshot&quot; in time of all metabolites present in a biological sample.&#xD;
      The imaging procedure should take approximately 20 minutes. All study related collections of&#xD;
      samples will be done in a single visit if possible. There are no direct benefits to&#xD;
      participants. This is not a treatment study.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Interstitial lung diseases (ILD) are a group of chronic, progressive lung disorders. The most&#xD;
      common ILD is idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) with an average survival ranging between&#xD;
      2.5-5 years after diagnosis. The term pulmonary fibrosis means scarring of the lung tissue&#xD;
      and is the cause of worsening shortness of breath. IPF can frequently affect the tissue&#xD;
      between the air sacs in the lung called the interstitium and many other areas in lung (blood&#xD;
      vessels and air passage ways). Earlier diagnosis of ILD is a prerequisite for better&#xD;
      long-term outcomes. However, disease detection and assessment of progression are reliant on&#xD;
      many varying host and environmental influences. As a result, patients with ILD are often&#xD;
      misdiagnosed early in the disease process. Moreover, patients diagnosed with ILD have&#xD;
      different disease courses and predicting which patient is at risk of progression is a&#xD;
      challenging problem. Many personalized medicine approaches are being developed but there is a&#xD;
      lack of available biomarkers in clinical practice. Biomarkers comes from a new experimental&#xD;
      technique called metabolomics which is becoming widely used in medicine and biology for&#xD;
      studying living organisms. The method measures the levels of large numbers of naturally&#xD;
      occurring small molecules (called metabolites) that are present in the blood, saliva, breath&#xD;
      and tissues. The pattern, or fingerprint, of metabolites in human samples can be used to&#xD;
      learn about the health of an organism and perhaps allow physicians to diagnose, treat, and&#xD;
      follow the progress of specific diseases. Clinical and functional models lack predictive&#xD;
      ability to detect patients at risk of disease progression. Thus, there is an urgent need to&#xD;
      develop accurate prediction models for disease diagnosis and assess treatment effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CT-derived ventilation (CT-V) imaging includes quantitative lung function imaging and lung&#xD;
      compliance imaging. CT-V is a newer image processing based technique that uses mathematical&#xD;
      modeling and scientific computing to gather changes in lung tissue volumes during the&#xD;
      breathing cycle. Beaumont is currently using CT-V for radiotherapy planning. CT-V produces a&#xD;
      full 3D map of ventilation/breathing, has better image resolution, provides pertinent&#xD;
      measurable imaging information, and does not require a contrast agent. Thus, high-resolution&#xD;
      anatomical and functional information can be derived using CT-V.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To better understand the functional and radiographic changes seen in patients with ILD, there&#xD;
      is a need to further examine the downstream changes occurring at the level of proteins and&#xD;
      metabolites. Metabolomics provides a &quot;snapshot&quot; in time of all metabolites present in a&#xD;
      biological sample. Proteins alone or integrated with other systems, is a particularly&#xD;
      informative tool for understanding disease biology in ILD patients.Using an untargeted&#xD;
      metabolomics platform and profiling serum and breathe from the patients will determine if&#xD;
      additional or more robust biomarkers of disease can be identified and, in conjunction with&#xD;
      the assessment of regional ventilation differences through CT-V, will provide a better&#xD;
      insight into disease process and further help with accurate prognostication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants who have consented for the study and have meet all the inclusion criteria and&#xD;
      none of the exclusion criteria will have one full inspiration and expiration CT, and two&#xD;
      4D-CT scans under two different pressures (5 and 10 cm water), except for healthy volunteers.&#xD;
      They will have their breath profiled using Owlstone platform and serum collected for&#xD;
      metabolomics testing within one week period. Participants will be asked to refrain from&#xD;
      smoking one day prior to the study date. All study related sampling will be done in a single&#xD;
      visit if possible and if not possible all study procedures and samples will be collected&#xD;
      within a one week period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Disease progression will be assessed using chart review over the next 24 months to assess&#xD;
      standard of care pulmonary function evaluation and corresponding CT features respiratory&#xD;
      hospitalizations and mortality.&#xD;

    <description>CT-V scores between inhalation and exhalation will be calculated at a voxel level on each lung using the &quot;Integrated Jacobian Formulation&quot; (IJV) CT-V method in patients with IPF, non-IPF ILD and COPD/emphysema patients. Several factors, including the volume of identified &quot;cold spots&quot; (areas with decreased ventilation), total ventilation (the integral of CT-V image over the whole lung), and texture analytics (local means, variances, etc.) will be used to define a CT-V pulmonary function metric. This measure is reported in liters with lower numbers indicating reduced lung function.</description>
