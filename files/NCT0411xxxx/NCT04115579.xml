  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To investigate whether low glycaemic index (GI) biscuits have the greatest impact on the&#xD;
      post-meal glucose response and on the overall 24 hour blood glucose control, using the&#xD;
      continuous glucose monitoring system (CGMS™)&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study was a randomized, non-blinded, crossover design. Randomization conducted using&#xD;
      www.randomizer.org. Each participant came for two test sessions (each of 3 days- Days 0, 1&#xD;
      and 2) with each session separated by at least three days (to avoid crossover effects). Test&#xD;
      foods: The foods were Control and Test [Low glycemic index (GI)] biscuits. The foods will&#xD;
      vary in macronutrient, micronutrients and fibre contents. Screening session: Potential&#xD;
      participants attend a first session for consenting and screening procedures. Subjects will be&#xD;
      at the centre for the study between 8:00-9:00am, with screening session lasting approximately&#xD;
      1 hour. Subjects will have to come following a 10-12 hour overnight fast each day.&#xD;
      Fingerprick blood sample (5μl) is required for the screening session (to establish fasting&#xD;
      glucose concentration). Screening questionnaire: The screening questionnaire will include&#xD;
      contact information, demographic, general health details, and physical activity level. This&#xD;
      information will be used to determine whether the participant is eligible for the study, as&#xD;
      well as to check for any possible confounders that may influence the study outcomes.&#xD;
      Anthropometric measurements: Body weight and body composition will be measured using&#xD;
      bioelectrical impedance analysis (Tanita scale). Height will be measured using a stadiometer&#xD;
      in order to calculate participants' BMI. Waist circumference will be measured at the minimum&#xD;
      circumference between the iliac crest and the rib cage. Hip circumference will be measured at&#xD;
      the maximum protuberance of the buttocks. Biceps and triceps skinfold measurements will also&#xD;
      be taken. Blood pressure will also be measured. Blood pressure: Blood pressure will be&#xD;
      measured using an Omron blood pressure monitor (Model HEM-907) at baseline. Participants will&#xD;
      be seated for five minutes before blood pressure is measured. Measurements will be taken in&#xD;
      duplicate and the averaged results will be recorded. (approximately 1 teaspoon or 5 ml) will&#xD;
      be collected from subject via passive drooling (only once during). Start of test session (Day&#xD;
      0-Day 2) Day 0 If subject is eligible, subjects will be enrolled into the study. Subject will&#xD;
      undergo the insertion of the Continuous Glucose Monitoring System (CGMS™) sensor the day&#xD;
      before the test day (Day 0) to allow for the monitor to stabilize overnight. Medtronic's&#xD;
      iPro2 Professional CGMS, designed to gain more complete insights into the glycaemic profiles&#xD;
      of a person. The CGMS sensor will be inserted into the adipose tissue in the abdominal area&#xD;
      by trained researchers and nurses. Subjects will have to wait in the laboratory for 1 hour&#xD;
      after insertion for the sensor to be stabilized. After 1 hour the inserted CGMS sensor will&#xD;
      be calibrated against a manual finger-prick blood glucose sample (5 μL, a small drop). Manual&#xD;
      calibration using finger-prick blood samples will need to be carried out before every meal&#xD;
      and before bed in the night (5 μL each for before dinner and before sleeping). The&#xD;
      calibrations before dinner and bed will have to be carried out the subjects at home.&#xD;
      Therefore, the subjects will be provided with a finger-prick blood glucose test kit to take&#xD;
      home and instructed on how to correctly use it and measure blood glucose values. Calibration&#xD;
      finger pricks will be made using disposable individual lancets. This may cause minimal&#xD;
      discomfort. The volume of blood taken each time will be 5 μL (a small drop). For Day 0,&#xD;
      subjects will be provided a standard dinner meal to be consumed at home at 7pm. Afterwhich,&#xD;
      they will be asked to not eat and drink anything except water after 10:30 pm. They will also&#xD;
      be instructed to arrive at the CNRC the following morning in an overnight fasted state. On&#xD;
      the evenings before the test sessions, subject will be reminded to have no strenuous physical&#xD;
      activities and no consumption of alcoholic beverages. Day 1 On the test Day 1, participants&#xD;
      will be asked to attend the testing sessions after an overnight fast of ten to twelve hours,&#xD;
      and arrive between 8:00-9:00am, with each session lasting approximately 4 hours. One fasting&#xD;
      blood sample will be collected by fingerprick for calibration of the CGMS glucose meter (5&#xD;
      μL, a small drop). Then, an indwelling catheter will be inserted into a vein in the forearm.&#xD;
      Subsequently, a blood sample will be taken from a cannula to measure baseline values.&#xD;
      Immediately after that, participants will be served a test breakfast, where they will be&#xD;
      asked to consume within 15 minutes. Following the test breakfast meal, further blood samples&#xD;
      will be taken (from the cannula) for the next 15, 30, 45, 60, 90, 120, 150, 180 minutes. The&#xD;
      blood samples collected at each timepoint will be measured for insulin and metabolic&#xD;
      biomarkers related to the intake of the test meal ingredients. The amount of blood that will&#xD;
      be collected at every time point will be about 1.2 teaspoon of blood (approximately 6 ml),&#xD;
      the accumulative amount per test session will not be more than 11 teaspoons of blood&#xD;
      (approximately 55 ml), and the accumulative amount for the entire study duration will not be&#xD;
      more than 22 teaspoons of blood (approximately 110 ml), by cannula. For the fingerprick&#xD;
      calibration, 5 μL is taken after insertion of sensor, before each meal and before sleeping.&#xD;
      So a total of 9 fingerpricks will be taken for one test session. Therefore, a total of 18&#xD;
      fingerpricks for the entire two sessions. (approximately 90 μL equivalent to approximately&#xD;
      1/5 of a teaspoon). A standard lunch will then be served and afterwhich the cannula is&#xD;
      removed. Subjects will take a fingerprick blood glucose (5 μL, a small drop) for calibration&#xD;
      of the CGMS before their standard lunch meal. Subjects are to consume the entire lunch meal&#xD;
      in 15 minutes. After lunch, participants will be provided with their snack and dinner meal to&#xD;
      be consumed at home and they will leave the research facility. Before snack, dinner and&#xD;
      before sleeping, participants are to take their own fingerprick blood glucose for calibration&#xD;
      of the CGMS.Day 2 Participants will return the following day, Day 2, between 8:00-9:00am.&#xD;
      Participants will have the CGMS sensor removed. A final fingerprick (5 μL, a small drop) for&#xD;
      calibration purposes will be done 15 minutes before removal of the sensor. This marks the end&#xD;
      of one session and participant will return for the next session after 3 days of washout&#xD;
      period. Participants attend a total of about 15 hours for two sessions (including one&#xD;
      screening visit lasting around 1 hour). Participants will spend approximately 1 hour for&#xD;
      screening session, 1 hour for Day 0, 4 hours for Day 1 and about half hour on Day 2. This&#xD;
      will repeat for the next session. All test and standard meals in the research facility will&#xD;
      be served with 250ml of water. All the study diets will be prepared in the CNRC food&#xD;
      preparation kitchen and will use locally sourced ingredients and food purchased from local&#xD;
      supermarkets and food distributors.&#xD;
