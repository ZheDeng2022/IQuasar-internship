  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ultrasound has become clinical skill widely used in most medical disciplines. Institutions&#xD;
      are changing their curricula to implementing basic ultrasound knowledge, often supplementing&#xD;
      traditional teaching with 'near-peer' tutoring through classes held by advanced peers.&#xD;
      Near-peer tutoring has been found to be both effective and cost-effective.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Switzerland the most popular course in postgraduate training is a resource-intensive&#xD;
      21-hour basic course for abdominal ultrasound. However, this is expensive, and may not be the&#xD;
      best way to impart these skills to undergraduates, who need training more adapted to their&#xD;
      needs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore a 21-hour blended-learning ultrasound course, comprising 5 hours of e-learning and&#xD;
      16 hours of near-peer tutoring has been developped. Students and their near-peer tutors&#xD;
      autonomously organize individual practical teaching sessions within a 16 weeks time period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Medical students from second to fourth year at the Universities of Bern, Fribourg and Zurich&#xD;
      will be included. Stratified by study site, students will be randomized to one of the two&#xD;
      interventions. The blended-learning group will receive e-learning and near-peer tutoring over&#xD;
      16 weeks; the other group will receive 21 hours of teaching, from ultrasound experts, in a&#xD;
      2.5-day course. All participants will undergo a six-station OSCE directly after the course&#xD;
      and 6 months later. Students will fill out online questionnaires at baseline, directly after&#xD;
      the course and 6 months later. The mean scores of both groups will be compared at six months&#xD;
      after the end of both courses. Secondary outcome measures will be students' ultrasound skills&#xD;
      immediately after the courses, student satisfaction, multivariate regression exploring&#xD;
      factors that affect outcome at 6 months and exploratory subgroup analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Discussion:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is designed to compare the current way of ultrasound education in Switzerland with&#xD;
      a new blended learning course. It aims to determine whether the blended learning course is as&#xD;
      good as, or better than the existing 21-hour standard course. If this is found to be the&#xD;
      case, blended learning could help to expand capacity to offer such courses to undergraduate&#xD;
      medical students. It would eventually allow undergraduate Swiss medical students to acquire&#xD;
      ultrasound skills before starting their residencies. This study also aims at improving the&#xD;
      understanding of how to achieve effective student-centred learning supported by near-peer&#xD;
      tutoring.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Over the last decades, ultrasound (US) examination has become commonly used in many medical&#xD;
      specialties, including internal medicine and primary care. Young doctors often perform simple&#xD;
      ultrasound investigations as residents in internal medicine or primary care especially in&#xD;
      emergency care. Currently, 30% of Swiss primary care practices are equipped with an&#xD;
      ultrasound machine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Swiss Society for Ultrasound in Medicine (SGUM/SSUM) is the accreditation body for&#xD;
      ultrasound education in Switzerland. Doctors must obtain a certificate from the SGUM before&#xD;
      they can bill ultrasound examinations for insurance payments. However, ultrasound courses are&#xD;
      time-intensive (63 hours total, plus a final examination), and are offered in the&#xD;
      postgraduate phase, when doctors often have few resources and little time. This may explain&#xD;
      why only about half of General Practitioners who use ultrasound have the SGUM certificate.&#xD;
      For the half without the certificate, not only can they not bill their ultrasound examination&#xD;
      to an insurance company, but also the quality of the examination is less assured, as they&#xD;
      have not demonstrated their competence in US skills in the SGUM examination. This may lead to&#xD;
      insecurity for the patient and for the performing doctor. There is also a risk that this&#xD;
      results in unnecessary examinations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The SGUM certificate is achieved by passing three courses (basic/advanced/final; 21 hours&#xD;
      each) as well as a summative final examination. Between courses, trainees must perform a&#xD;
      certain number of US examinations on real patients, under direct and distant supervision.&#xD;
      These courses are now being opened to undergraduates, and the 2017 revision of the Swiss&#xD;
      learning objectives for medical studies (PROFILES) added basic US skills as mandatory&#xD;
      learning goal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the past years US training courses at Swiss medical universities were mostly optional, and&#xD;
      were quickly overbooked. This shortage of courses could be addressed by using near-peer&#xD;
      tutors, which are increasingly used in faculty-organized US classes. Near-peer tutors are&#xD;
      &quot;trainees one or more years senior to trainees on the same level of medical education&#xD;
      spectrum&quot;. Five randomized-controlled trials of ultrasound training have compared near-peer&#xD;
      tutoring with faculty-led teaching and assessed students' practical ultrasound skills as a&#xD;
      primary outcome measure. Four of these found peer-tutoring to be non-inferior and one found&#xD;
      that students in the near-peer-tutoring group slightly underperformed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Near-peer tutoring in undergraduate US training offers many potential advantages over&#xD;
      traditional faculty-based teaching:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Since mostly reciprocal US is being done by the participating medical students, perfect&#xD;
           conditions for learning basic sonographic anatomy can be found. Medical students, in&#xD;
           contrast to patients, are mostly slender, healthy and mobile.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In near-peer tutoring settings, students are more likely to ask questions and&#xD;
           participate actively. In addition, having ultrasound skills can help students feel more&#xD;
           secure in their basic clinical examination skills.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Near-peer tutoring relieves pressure on the university by alleviating the increasing&#xD;
           teaching demand and by being cost-effective.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  There is evidence that students who work as tutors constantly improve their own skills.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Autumn 2017, the Institute of Primary Health Care (BIHAM) at the University of Bern set up&#xD;
      a working group of 24 US experts from all Swiss universities and of representatives of SGUM&#xD;
      sections. The group decided on the &quot;Swiss standard&quot; for basic abdominal ultrasound&#xD;
      examination after discussing it at two consensus-building meetings. In Spring 2018,&#xD;
      videotapes of SGUM experts demonstrating the ultrasound examination of the various abdominal&#xD;
      organs, based on that consensus, were recorded. These videos were integrated into interactive&#xD;
      e-learning modules. They have been available to all Swiss medical students since the&#xD;
      beginning of 2019.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In parallel, a formal system of training and continuous education for near-peer tutors was&#xD;
      put in place by a collaboration of motivated students and faculty staff. Near-peer tutors&#xD;
      receive at least 6 days of US training, including teaching on didactic techniques, and&#xD;
      afterwards be registered as so-called 'junior-tutors' by SGUM. They must offer at least four&#xD;
      hours of US class per semester, but can choose the times and dates. Tutors will be reimbursed&#xD;
      for their teaching through course fees paid by course participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The standard &quot;Basic course in abdominal ultrasound&quot;, delivered over 2.5 consecutive days,&#xD;
      contains 5 hours of theory and 16 hours of practical training. In contrast, our&#xD;
      blended-learning course is more student-centred, in that it expects students to take the&#xD;
      initiative to learn the theory from (A) the e-learning developed by the working group, and&#xD;
      (B) 16 hours of near-peer tutoring in groups of two to four, at times that are mutually&#xD;
      agreeable for tutors and students, without faculty involvement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The e-learning is made up of five modules starting by an introductory e-learning module on&#xD;
      technical basics in ultrasound, followed by four practical modules comprising the abdominal&#xD;
      organs. For each of the four practical modules, students start by working through the&#xD;
      e-learning module, followed by four hours of individual near-peer tutoring sessions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Students decide the pace of their 16 hours of training, typically over a four-month period.&#xD;
      When a student completes all five e-learning modules and has gathered 16 signatures from the&#xD;
      peer-tutored classes, they can apply to take a summative final examination. If they pass the&#xD;
      Objective Structured Clinical Examination (OSCE) validated by Hofer et al. (2011) and adapted&#xD;
      to Swiss needs, they are accredited by SGUM, according to Swiss national accreditation&#xD;
      guidelines, for the &quot;Basic course in abdominal ultrasound&quot; - the first of the three&#xD;
      ultrasound courses within the SGUM curriculum.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The OSCE will be assessed twice for every participant. Once at the end of the course and once&#xD;
      6 months after the end of the course. The second OSCE will be the primary outcome, since it&#xD;
      evaluates long-term retention of acquired US knowledge. Every student will be tested by six&#xD;
      different examiners in each OSCE. Differences in difficulty of the four series of OSCE&#xD;
      stations as well as difficulty of every station will be taken into account in the statistical&#xD;
      analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The blended-learning course offers several other advantages by implementing modern didactics:&#xD;
      by distributing teaching sessions over 16 weeks instead of just 2.5 consecutive days,&#xD;
      students benefit from &quot;spaced repetition&quot; which improves long term retention. In our&#xD;
      programme, students can decide which session to choose next, and tutors and students arrange&#xD;
      the teaching sessions according to their availability and needs, so learning is&#xD;
      student-centred. These factors differentiate our study from the near-peer tutoring in&#xD;
      ultrasound education reported in some studies, in which tutors engage in scheduled courses&#xD;
      organized by university faculty.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Between randomization and the end of the training (t = 16 weeks), students will be instructed&#xD;
      not to undergo any additional training (e-learning, practical sessions or other) other than&#xD;
      those provided within the intervention. Additional training will be recorded directly after&#xD;
      the end of the training by questionnaire and by going through e-learning logs. During the&#xD;
      6-month follow-up period, students in both groups will be equally encouraged to continue&#xD;
      self-organised training and both will be granted access to ultrasound machines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adjusting to local curricula we will primarily recruit students in semester 7 in Bern (total&#xD;
      medical student intake per year = 220) and in semester 6 in Zurich (240) and Fribourg (120).&#xD;
      At each site, we will present the programme during a plenary session, assisted by our local&#xD;
      co-investigators.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To avoid systematic differences in additional training during the follow-up period, the&#xD;
      following rules will put in place:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Students will only be told their test results from the first test after the end of the&#xD;
           study&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Test performance in the follow-up test will have no effect on the accreditation&#xD;
&#xD;
      To reduce loss to follow-up, we will:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Require all students who apply for the programme to sign a separate form confirming&#xD;
           their availability and intention to complete the course and the examinations&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Reimburse participants 50.- CHF after they have taken the second OSCE.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Reimburse travel costs for the second OSCE&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Hand out the test result and the course certificate only after the second OSCE&#xD;
&#xD;
      Students' motivation for ultrasound training is very high. The optional courses at Swiss&#xD;
      universities are typically overbooked within minutes and many students are disappointed that&#xD;
      they are unable to take part. Our study will give students the opportunity to get a&#xD;
      certificate accredited by the SGUM for a course fee of 200.- CHF, regardless of the&#xD;
      intervention they are assigned to. Postgraduate training for the same degree costs around&#xD;
      1200.- CHF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will use centralized computed randomization in blocks of 4 to allocate each of the&#xD;
      participants to one of the two study arms, with allocation in a 1:1 ratio, stratified by&#xD;
      study site. The reason for block randomisation is the requirement of the control group to&#xD;
      comprise of exactly 24 or 28 students due to the maximum group size of 4 students per tutor.&#xD;
      The randomization will be performed by a blinded external partner (Clinical Trials Unit in&#xD;
      Bern).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome assessors will be experienced sonographers who have not taught course participants of&#xD;
      either group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To ensure high interrater-reliability, faculty training for all assessors will be held&#xD;
      immediately before the OSCE. In the first part of this training, the assessors discuss key&#xD;
      aspects of the rating using videotaped examples of OSCE stations to achieve a common&#xD;
      standard. At the end of the training, assessors will rate another video example, where the&#xD;
      interrater-reliability will be assessed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OSCE assessors will be blinded to group allocation. The assessments will be at the same time&#xD;
      for each group. We will instruct students not to reveal their group allocation to the OSCE&#xD;
      assessors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size calculation has been done as follows: Based on a pilot with 20 students we expect&#xD;
      a mean score of 33/50 points per station with a standard deviation (SD) of 4 points. The&#xD;
      study was powered for non-inferiority using a margin of a -1.5 points for the difference in&#xD;
      mean OSCE scores between the intervention and control group in the practical exam at 6 months&#xD;
      (primary outcome). 1.5 points difference would correspond to an effect size of 0.375 standard&#xD;
      deviations (SD), which we would still consider as non-inferior. We calculated the sample size&#xD;
      with the assumption that the intervention group will perform somewhat better (+0.5 in mean&#xD;
      score) than the control group based on test results from previous pilots. We chose a 1-sided&#xD;
      alpha-error of 0.05 and a power of 90% (138 participants). Allowing for a 9% dropout rate we&#xD;
      decided to include 152 students.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Discussion:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the new blended-learning format is shown to be at least as good as the existing standard&#xD;
      course, we could quickly expand our capacity to offer such courses to undergraduate medical&#xD;
      students, replacing resource-intensive faculty-led courses with peer-assisted learning&#xD;
      programmes. This will eventually allow all undergraduate students to acquire ultrasound&#xD;
      skills that will help them in their residencies. The national accreditation body fully&#xD;
      supports this near-peer-tutoring-based course both financially and through full accreditation&#xD;
      of a pilot project and has committed to continue its support if we find that this teaching&#xD;
      format produces results that are just as good as, or better than, the usual faculty-led&#xD;
      courses. Learning more about the advantages conferred by student-centred learning through&#xD;
      near-peer teaching will enable us to design better peer-assisted learning programmes and to&#xD;
      design new, similar programmes in other areas.&#xD;
