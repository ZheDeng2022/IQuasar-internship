      INTRODUTION The increasing prevalence of obesity in developed countries has also reached&#xD;
      Brazil in the last two decades and is now among the ten countries with the largest number of&#xD;
      obese people in the world1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to the Vigilance Survey of Risk Factors and Protection for Chronic Diseases by&#xD;
      Telephone Inquiry (Vigitel, 2014), overweight in Brazil affects 49.1% of women and obesity&#xD;
      affects 18.2% of male population2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The most recent data on the spread of the disease in the world present alarming numbers. It&#xD;
      is estimated that 1.9 billion adults around the world are overweight and more than 600&#xD;
      million are considered obese3.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Characterized by excess of body fat, obesity is a chronic disease of multifactorial origin&#xD;
      that is difficult to handle when it reaches body mass index (BMI) above 40 kg/m2. In these&#xD;
      cases, conventional treatments such as restriction food intake, medication and monitored&#xD;
      physical exercise are not efficient to sustained weight loss and in some cases, weight&#xD;
      reduction in individuals refractory to these methods4.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For those individuals who do not respond to these treatments for more than two years and BMI&#xD;
      ≥35 kg/m2 with comorbidities such as sleep apnea, Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus, hypertension,&#xD;
      dyslipidemias, depression, asthma, infertility among others, surgery has been considered as&#xD;
      the most efficient long-term treatment. Surgical treatment results in loss of between 20 and&#xD;
      40% of the initial weight or between 60 and 80% of the excess weight, as well as higher rates&#xD;
      of remission of Type 2 Diabetes and Metabolic Syndrome, improvement in the quality of life&#xD;
      and reduction in use hypoglycemic, antihypertensive and hypolipidemic drugs5-7.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, numerous studies have reported weight regain in approximately 20% of these patients,&#xD;
      from the second year of surgery. The review by Shah et al. demonstrates long-term weight loss&#xD;
      and the risk of recurrence of obesity-related comorbidities8. Similar results were observed&#xD;
      in the study by Pajecki et al. when evaluated between 5 and 9 years after surgery9.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Weight recovery has been justified by a variety of causes, such as the surgical method used,&#xD;
      especially those that are strictly restrictive, the technical failure of the operation and&#xD;
      the eating behavior, influenced or not by mental health factors such as anxiety, depression,&#xD;
      binge eating. More recently, it has been discussed possible failures in entero-hormonal&#xD;
      stimulation that could influence the reduction of satiety as demonstrated by Santo et&#xD;
      al10,11.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Another hypothesis for weight regain would be the reduction of metabolic rate due to massive&#xD;
      weight loss. Das et al. observed a 25% drop in resting energy expenditure after weight loss&#xD;
      and stabilization due to loss of free fat mass and fat mass suggesting that there was a&#xD;
      metabolic adaptation and an increase in energy efficiency when evaluated after 14 and 24&#xD;
      months12.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The association of weight loss and marked fall in the resting metabolic rate (RMR) probably&#xD;
      occurs due to thermogenic adaptation, since the loss of 10% or more of body weight (BW) can&#xD;
      reduce the energy expenditure of 24h by approximately 20-25%. Thus, the energy needs fall by&#xD;
      300-400 calories/day for weight maintenance is 10-15% lower when compared to a non-obese&#xD;
      individual, based only on FFM and FM reduction13,14.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bariatric surgery is associated with a decrease in total energy expenditure due to a&#xD;
      reduction in the resting metabolic rate, which may be justified by the alteration of the body&#xD;
      composition (BC) of both FFM and FM15.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For Abdeen and Roux, patients regaining weight after 2 years had low resting energy&#xD;
      expenditure after RYGB and the decrease in metabolic rate can be attenuated when the relative&#xD;
      lean mass preservation occurs16. However, in this same review, in the study by Carrasco et&#xD;
      al. it could be observed that the drop in energy expenditure/FFM% was positively related to&#xD;
      the initial energy expenditure and to the change in the percentage of FM, indicating that the&#xD;
      metabolic adaptation was not associated with loss of FFM but with high RMR before surgery17.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Olbers et al. observed the reduction in the RMR of 50 individuals submitted to gastric bypass&#xD;
      and vertical gastroplasty after one year and did not find a statistical difference when&#xD;
      compared between the different surgical techniques18.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study conducted by Faria et al. evaluated the RMR of 36 patients after two years of&#xD;
      surgery, separating them into two groups. The group of individuals who had recovered from 2&#xD;
      kg of the total weight presented an average difference of 260 kcal/day lower than the group&#xD;
      that maintained the weight. When RMR was calculated from predictive equations it was observed&#xD;
      that they are overestimated in this weight regimen19.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although the impact of diet-induced weight loss on energy expenditure has been widely&#xD;
      studied, the impact of bariatric surgery on total energy expenditure, resting energy&#xD;
      expenditure, and diet-induced thermogenesis has not yet been fully elucidated. A compelling&#xD;
      hypothesis would be the modification of the BCn20.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends the Body Mass Index (BMI),&#xD;
      where weight (kg)/height (m)2, as a reference for the diagnosis of obesity, using different&#xD;
      classifications to determine the degrees of severity of disease. However, although its use is&#xD;
      widely diffused due to its simple applicability, either in ease of measurement or in the&#xD;
      minimum cost, it is considered an imprecise measure since it does not consider the great&#xD;
      variation of fat distribution and the body components such as FM, FFM, muscle mass, bone mass&#xD;
      and water21,22.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The precise evaluation of the BC through the determination of its components allows&#xD;
      establishing prognostic of the occurrence of diseases associated with the high amount of&#xD;
      corporal fat. It would also be possible to establish interventions with adequate evaluation&#xD;
      of body compartment alterations, especially after surgical treatment of obesity, where weight&#xD;
      loss occurs intensely and leads to a change in BC23-26.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the study by Flanbaum et al. the group of patients stratified as hypometabolic presented a&#xD;
      significant increase in the metabolic rate in the first six weeks post-bypass, while there&#xD;
      was no change in the normometabolic group. This pattern changed significantly in reevaluation&#xD;
      after 2 years, when the normometabolic group had a reduction in the resting metabolic rate,&#xD;
      although it remained within the normality norm, indicating a compensatory metabolic response&#xD;
      to the food restriction designed to &quot;protect&quot; body weight27.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The maintenance of basic body activities is represented by RMR or resting energy&#xD;
      expenditure28. RMR can be defined as the energy required by the body at rest or the amount of&#xD;
      energy spent by the individual while awake after an absorptive period in a thermally neutral&#xD;
      environment and without having exercised in the last 24 hours29.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RMR and basal metabolic rate (BMR) are similar and differ only in gauging, since BMR is&#xD;
      measured in the morning, after a fasting night, without any exercise in the last 24 hours,&#xD;
      free of emotional stress, familiarized with the appliance and completely rested30. In&#xD;
      general, RMR may be a better indicator of daily energy requirements than RMR31.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RMR is slightly larger than BMR, since it adds to the latter the additional energy&#xD;
      expenditure required for muscle contraction. However, it differs from the former by less than&#xD;
      10%, allowing both to be used. Representing the main component of daily energy expenditure,&#xD;
      RMR corresponds to 60% to 75% of total expenditure and in active individuals can reach&#xD;
      50%32-34. while in sedentary individuals, up to 75%. Dietary energy expenditure, when&#xD;
      macronutrient absorption occurs, lasts around 12 hours after the last meal, corresponds to&#xD;
      approximately 10%, and energy expenditure with physical activity (acute or chronic) is not&#xD;
      included. between 15% and 30% (Figure 1)32-34.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The determination of RMR depends to a large extent on the amount of muscle mass and the&#xD;
      activity of other metabolically active tissues such as heart, brain, kidneys and liver35.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Figure 1. The thermodynamic perspective of energy expenditure&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bradford B. (2000)36 In a meta-analysis conducted by McMurray et al. comparative studies on&#xD;
      the influence of sex, age and nutritional status on RMR have recently been identified.&#xD;
      African Americans had approximately 10% to 20% lower RMR than whites and lower FM than in&#xD;
      Caucasians or Hispanics. Among women, rates are lower than in men and in the elderly lower&#xD;
      than in young adults. Differences between gender and age groups could be related to the&#xD;
      composition of FFM, a metabolically more active tissue, mainly muscle mass37. In addition,&#xD;
      the literature on RMR is clear about the location of FM in the body, important for its&#xD;
      understanding38.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Studies have shown that FM can influence RMR as well as muscle mass, especially when it is&#xD;
      predominantly located in the abdominal region, which indicates that it also has a metabolic&#xD;
      function when compared to total fat. The study by Luhrmann evaluated the relationship between&#xD;
      abdominal and peripheral fat with MRT and demonstrated that abdominal fat influenced in&#xD;
      women39.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visceral fat is metabolically more active than the others because it is associated with the&#xD;
      release of free fatty acids in the portal circulation which can lead to peripheral&#xD;
      hyperinsulinemia and, therefore, less sensitivity to its anti-lipolytic effect. Visceral fat&#xD;
      plays a predominant role in the development of metabolic complications, in addition to&#xD;
      justifying the correlation between central fat and RMR40-42.&#xD;
&#xD;
      JUSTIFICATION The relevance of this study is to identify/analyze the changes in RMR and BC&#xD;
      after bariatric surgery and its relation to weight regain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OBJECTIVE To analize RMR and body composition (FM, FFM) before and after weight loss (6 and&#xD;
      36 months) induced by bariatric surgery with weight regain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODS Ethic This study was elaborated and will be performed at the Clinical Hospital of the&#xD;
      Medical School of the University of São Paulo (HCFMUSP). The patients involved will receive&#xD;
      the Informed Consent Form (ICF) for their agreement to participate in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Prospective study keywords: obesity, resting metabolic rate, body composition analysis,&#xD;
      bariatric surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Casuistic The sample, calculated through Test t (Annex 1), consists of 49 adults selected at&#xD;
      the ambulatory of the Bariatric and Metabolic Surgery Unit of the Department of&#xD;
      Gastroenterology of HCFMUSP in the periods: preoperative, 6 and 36 months after surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria Patients of both sexes, above 16 years of age, will undergo bypass&#xD;
      techniques and vertical gastroplasty performed at the institution.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion Criteria Adult patients over 60 years old, undergoing revision surgery and other&#xD;
      surgical techniques will be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anthropometric Assessment Anthropometric variables will be obtained on the same day as the&#xD;
      evaluation of BC by trained evaluators.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The PC body weight (kg) will be measured by In Body 230, 2.0, (Biospace Seoul, Korea). The&#xD;
      patient should be in the orthostatic position, facing the display, in the center of the&#xD;
      scale, barefoot, in light clothes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The height measurement (m) will be performed in a stadiometer coupled to the scale W 300,&#xD;
      Class III, with a maximum capacity of 2m. The patient will be kept with his back to the&#xD;
      meter, with the feet united, in an erect position, looking at horizon and arms extended to&#xD;
      the side of the body. The reading will be made in the nearest centimeter when the horizontal&#xD;
      rod of the vertical bar of the stature scale rests against the individual's head.&#xD;
&#xD;
      BMI (kg/m2) shall be determined by dividing body weight (kg) by height (m) squared.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Excess weight (EW, kg): difference in preoperative weight versus ideal weight. The ideal&#xD;
      weight (IW, kg) considered for the calculation of weight regain will be weight for BMI&#xD;
      25kg/m2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Weight loss (WL, kg): pre-surgery weight difference in relation to the lowest weight reached&#xD;
      after 18 or 24 months, obtained through the medical record.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Percentage of excess of weight loss (% EWL): percentage difference of weight loss in relation&#xD;
      to overweight, used as an indicator of success of surgery43.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evaluation of BC and RMR The evaluations will be held between 8:00 am and 10:00 am in the&#xD;
      Laboratory of Exercise and Movement Studies at the Institute of Orthopedics and Traumatology&#xD;
      of FMUSP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bioimpedance The BC measurements as FM (% and kg), FFM (% and kg), will be obtained by the&#xD;
      indirect noninvasive method of electrical bioimpedance (BIA) 230, 2.0, (Biospace Seoul,&#xD;
      Korea). Those evaluated will be standing and positioned on the platform electrodes, barefoot&#xD;
      and with their arms extended with their hands on the two supports (electrodes).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evaluation of RMR For the evaluation of the RMR, the values of VO2 and VCO2 will be collected&#xD;
      by the indirect calorimetry (IC) method using the Ultima CPX metabolic analyzer (MedGraphics,&#xD;
      USA), calibrated with each test. The daily energy expenditure (kcal/day) will be calculated&#xD;
      by the Weir equation44.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Equation Weir = [(3,9 * O2) + (1,1 * CO2) * 1440], where: O2 is the mean value consumed&#xD;
      (L/min) and CO2 is the expired mean value (L/min) 20 minutes computed for analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the day before the test day patients will be instructed to avoid drinking coffee, alcohol&#xD;
      or stimulants. For the test, they will be advised to wear light and comfortable clothing, to&#xD;
      fast from 4 h to 6 h and to make minimal physical effort on the way to the laboratory on the&#xD;
      test day. During the test, the patient should remain supine, avoid moving or sleeping.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The test will be performed under laboratory conditions for 40 min, and the spirometric values&#xD;
      will be collected from respiration to respiration. To begin the computation of the data, with&#xD;
      the individual already connected to the metabolic analyzer, data from the initial 20 minutes&#xD;
      for the stability of the physiological variables at rest will be neglected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RMRs will be calculated from the BIA and the Milflin's equation45. Evaluation of parameters&#xD;
      laboratory.&#xD;
