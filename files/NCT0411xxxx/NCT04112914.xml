  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Investigators will conduct a hybrid implementation-effectiveness evaluation of an&#xD;
      implementation toolkit that supports communication with families post-concussion in the&#xD;
      emergency department. Primary outcomes will be parent self-report of specific concussion&#xD;
      management behaviors two weeks post-visit. Investigators will also explore whether successful&#xD;
      implementation is associated with (1) improved parent knowledge and self-efficacy related to&#xD;
      helping their child adhere to CDC guidelines for returning to daily activities, school and&#xD;
      sports, and (2) decreased disparity in knowledge and self-efficacy between high and low&#xD;
      health literacy parents.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Parents can play an important role in evidence-based concussion management by (1) monitoring&#xD;
      their child's activity and level of stimulation, (2) communicating with school personnel&#xD;
      about potential need for short-term academic accommodations, and (3) ensuring their child&#xD;
      does not return to contact or collision sport prematurely and risk greater injury. However,&#xD;
      not all parents follow these evidence-based guidelines, in part due to health literacy&#xD;
      deficits, and further compounded by the poor fit and inconsistent implementation of&#xD;
      educational materials. The initial medical encounter following a concussion provides an&#xD;
      important opportunity for evidence-based knowledge translation to parents. Families at risk&#xD;
      of low health literacy most often seek initial post-concussion care in emergency departments&#xD;
      (ED) and often do not follow-up with a primary care provider or concussion specialist.&#xD;
      Knowledge translation to parents in the ED is often inconsistent in terms of content and&#xD;
      delivery, and existing approaches often do not meet the needs of families with low health&#xD;
      literacy. The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality's (AHRQ) Re-Engineered Discharge&#xD;
      (RED) Toolkit provides an evidence-based approach to supporting the implementation of parent&#xD;
      education that has not as yet been adapted for use post-concussion in the ED setting.&#xD;
      Investigators will work with stakeholders to develop toolkit to support evidence-based parent&#xD;
      education post-concussion in the ED. Guided by the Consolidated Framework for Implementation&#xD;
      Research, investigators will adapt the AHRQ RED Toolkit to facilitate post-concussion parent&#xD;
      education in the ED. The evidence-based parent education to be shared will be an asynchronous&#xD;
      text-based intervention, adapted to meet learning needs of parents with low health literacy&#xD;
      and limited English proficiency. Investigators will use parent and provider interviews to&#xD;
      iteratively develop the implementation toolkit in consultation with an advisory board&#xD;
      comprised of parents. The clinical trial component of the study will be a hybrid&#xD;
      implementation-effectiveness evaluation of the educational intervention. Primary outcomes&#xD;
      will be parent self-report of specific concussion management behaviors two weeks post-visit.&#xD;
      Investigators will also explore whether successful implementation is associated with (1)&#xD;
      improved parent knowledge and self-efficacy related to helping their child adhere to CDC&#xD;
      guidelines for returning to daily activities, school and sports, and (2) decreased disparity&#xD;
      in knowledge and self-efficacy between high and low health literacy parents. Achieving these&#xD;
      aims will result in a scalable approach to the implementation of the developed parent&#xD;
      education toolkit in the pediatric ED post-concussion. If parents are better able to follow&#xD;
      evidence-based guidelines for concussion, they will better advocate and care for their&#xD;
      children, and this should improve outcomes for all youth. More broadly, achieving these aims&#xD;
      will provide a model for engaging low health literacy parents in adapting evidence-based&#xD;
      educational practices for implementation in ED settings.&#xD;
