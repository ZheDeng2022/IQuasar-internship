  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a single-dose incremental, randomized, double-blind, parallel,&#xD;
      placebo-controlled study on safety, tolerance and pharmacokinetics healthy subjects.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Six dose-group trials are planned: 1 mg,4 mg,10 mg,20 mg,30 mg,and 45 mg.When the dose&#xD;
      reaches 45mg, if the standard of increasing dose termination is still not reached, the&#xD;
      researcher and the sponsor shall decide whether to continue the increasing dose after&#xD;
      reviewing the previous study data, and each increasing dose shall not exceed 33.3% (e.g.,&#xD;
      60mg) of the previous dose group. In the process of dose increasing, when the dose exceeds 20&#xD;
      mg, if the dose level reaches the dose termination standard, an intermediate dose is set&#xD;
      between this dose and the previous dose, and the study is returned to the intermediate dose&#xD;
      group.In this study, a parallel design was adopted, in which each subject received only one&#xD;
      dose of drug from one dose group, which ensured the safety of the subject to the greatest&#xD;
      extent, and also avoided the interference of safety and PK results caused by possible&#xD;
      insufficient elution or other factors.Among them, 1 mg dose group was the starting dose&#xD;
      group, and 6 subjects were randomly assigned into sy-007 group for injection or placebo group&#xD;
      at a ratio of 2:1. Only 2 subjects were given the drug for the first time. One day after the&#xD;
      first two subjects were given the drug, after ensuring the safety of the first two subjects,&#xD;
      the drug was given to the remaining 4 subjects.In other dose groups, sentry administration&#xD;
      was also used. The first 2 subjects received sy-007 injection or placebo respectively. After&#xD;
      3 days of hospitalization observation, the safety data of the first 2 cases were reviewed by&#xD;
      the researcher and the sponsor, and the remaining subjects in this dose group were determined&#xD;
      accordingly.Pharmacokinetic biological samples were collected from all dose groups and their&#xD;
      safety was assessed.A total of 66~90 healthy subjects will be enrolled.&#xD;
