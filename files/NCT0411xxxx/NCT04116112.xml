      The purpose of this study is to assess the safety of lowering blood pressure in acute stroke&#xD;
      patients that are successfully treated with a mechanical thrombectomy procedure. The&#xD;
      investogators will evaluate the hypothesis that lower blood pressure management strategies do&#xD;
      not result in larger volume of stroke or worse 3-month clinical outcome in these patients.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Several thousand patients suffer from an ischemic stroke caused by an occlusion of a large&#xD;
      blood vessel supplying the brain. Endovascular mechanical thrombectomy (EVT) has&#xD;
      revolutionized management of this most devastating type of ischemic stroke by allowing&#xD;
      removal of the occlusive clot. However, about half of the successfully EVT-treated patients&#xD;
      (~85% of all treated patients) still remain disabled at 90 days. Early evidence suggests that&#xD;
      patients with lower blood pressure (BP) after the thrombectomy procedure have better&#xD;
      outcomes. However, safety of lowering BP in these patients has not been determined. The&#xD;
      primary safety concern of lowering BP comes from the potential of compromising blood flow to&#xD;
      the &quot;at risk&quot; area of the brain following the stroke.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this trial is to evaluate the safety of lower BP management strategies in&#xD;
      patients who are successfully treated with endovascular treatment for ischemic stroke. The&#xD;
      investigator will enroll 120 individuals who qualify and randomly assign them to one of the&#xD;
      three systolic BP (SBP) targets: ≤180 mmHg, &lt;160 mmHg, and &lt;140 mmHg (40 patients in each&#xD;
      group). Treatment will begin soon after the blood clot causing the stroke is removed, using&#xD;
      anti-hypertensive medication given intravenously with a goal to lower and maintain the SBP&#xD;
      below assigned target for 24 hrs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The scientists will assess the safety of lower BP targets (&lt;160 mmHg and &lt;140 mmHg) by&#xD;
      quantifying the volume of stroke measured with an MRI scan obtained at 36+/-12 hours and&#xD;
      participants' functional status at 90 days measured with a patient centered disability score.&#xD;
      Participants will undergo the 36 +/-12-hour MRI scan as part of their routine clinical care&#xD;
      and will not be asked to prolong their hospital stay for study purpose. A phone interview&#xD;
      will take place to determine their functional status at 90-days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Enrollment of 120 patients will provide 80% power to detect a 10 cubic centimeter increase in&#xD;
      stroke volume and a 0.10 decrease in utility-weighted modified Rankin score (a&#xD;
      patient-centered disability score) for every 20 mmHg decrease in SBP. An interim analysis&#xD;
      will be conducted after enrollment of 60 patients at which time the study may stop for safety&#xD;
      concerns.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Utility-weighted modified Rankin Score</measure>
    <time_frame>90 days after treatment initiation</time_frame>
    <description>Modified Rankin score (mRS) is a scale for measuring the degree of disability or dependence of people who have suffered a stroke. 0 - no symptoms at all; 1 - no significant disability despite symptoms; able to carry out all usual duties and activities; 2- slight disability; unable to carry out all previous activities, but able to look after own affairs without assistance; 3- moderate disability; requiring some help, but able to walk without assistance; 4 - moderately severe disability; unable to walk without assistance and unable to attend to own bodily needs without assistance; 5 - severe disability; bedridden, incontinent and requiring constant nursing care and attention; 6- dead.&#xD;
Patient centered utility weights are applied to these scores as 1.0 for mRS level 0; 0.91 for mRS level 1; 0.76 for mRS level 2; 0.65 for mRS level 3; 0.33 for mRS level 4; 0 for mRS level 5; and 0 for mRS level 6. Unlike the mRS, the utility-weighted mRS runs from 0 to 1, with 0 being the worst.</description>
