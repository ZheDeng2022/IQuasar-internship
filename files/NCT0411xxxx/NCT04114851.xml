    <textblock>
      There are different types of pain generators that give different pain symptoms. In anesthesia&#xD;
      and surgery, the pain generator in connection with, for example, surgical procedures is&#xD;
      referred to as nociceptive pain. However, there is not enough evidence to support that these&#xD;
      physiological changes are direct signs of nociceptive stimulation. The same changes can be&#xD;
      seen with an autonomous stress trigger of origin other than just nociceptive stimulation.&#xD;
      This means that healthcare professionals who provide anesthesia to patients during, for&#xD;
      example, surgery may provide unnecessary pain relief drugs or do not provide pain relief when&#xD;
      needed. This is also true in awake patients when pain is complex that, for example, concerns&#xD;
      may increase the experience of pain and that healthcare professionals may even then&#xD;
      misinterpret and provide more pain-relieving drugs despite the actual need for another drug&#xD;
      or complementary treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Examples of these include heart rate variation, specific patterns in blood pressure and heart&#xD;
      rate response, heart rate amplitude, heart rate range, skin sweating and pupil response. The&#xD;
      reason why these changes have not been used to interpret nociceptive stimulation is directly&#xD;
      linked to an absence of technology that makes it possible to collect data and interpret these&#xD;
      changes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      list a number of methods / techniques that are under development, one of which is the&#xD;
      Nociception Level Index (NoL). NoL is an indexed value between 0 and 100 and is based on a&#xD;
      non-linear combination of nociception-related physiological variables (including heart rate&#xD;
      variation, plethysmograph pulse wave amplitude (PPGA) and changes in skin resistance).&#xD;
      Possibly NoL is the first evidence-based clinical technology that can discriminate pain&#xD;
      response when physiological response is not measured.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research field in the area of non-invasive objective monitoring of pain response in&#xD;
      relation to patients' experience of pain is currently almost non-existent in anesthesia /&#xD;
      anesthesia care This in turn can also lead to the development of patient safety both during&#xD;
      anesthesia and after surgery at nursing department for example, patient-controlled and&#xD;
      epidural pain relief in postoperative pain care. investigators intend to study the variation&#xD;
      of the NoL index linked to the need for opioids during anesthesia and also after completed&#xD;
      anesthesia when the patient wakes up and is in the ward.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Investigators study patients undergoing functional endoscopic sinus surgery (FESS),&#xD;
      concaplasty or lateral rhinotomy and who receive routine general anesthesia (anesthesia).&#xD;
      These patients often have an age between 30-60 years and not infrequently assessed with&#xD;
      regard to intraoperative and postoperative pain response. During the anesthesia study and&#xD;
      after anesthesia, an equipment that monitors the pain response NoL (pain monitor) is used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This kind of pain monitor has been around for about 10 years. Over the past 5 years, its&#xD;
      technology has evolved so much that in various countries it has become a monitoring system&#xD;
      that is used as a complement to anesthesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be a randomized intervention study in which the random determines whether the&#xD;
      patient's pain level is monitored using NoL or only according to traditional clinical&#xD;
      assessment intra- and post-operatively. The patient will be assessed with the post-Qrs test,&#xD;
      partly preoperatively (baseline) and partly post-operatively to assess the rate of recovery&#xD;
      compared to baseline. The collected data is analyzed afterwards to possibly determine whether&#xD;
      it is possible to determine differences in recovery, based on choice of pain monitoring&#xD;
      method (Pain NoL or clinical assessment, pulse, blood pressure, BIS index, NoL index, amount&#xD;
      of opioid intraoperatively and opioid amount postoperatively, VAS / NRS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients included in the study will be persons over the age of 18 and who agree to&#xD;
      participate. Both women and men are included. Exclusion criteria include problems with the&#xD;
      Swedish language or other communicative difficulties that make the assessment more difficult&#xD;
      and patients with pacemakers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both groups are anesthetized with propofol infusion and oxygen in the air, which is given&#xD;
      analgesic remifentanil during surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization is done through mixed, closed envelopes. Prior to the anesthesia, extra oxygen&#xD;
      will be added and standard monitoring will be connected to the patient (ECG, noninvasive&#xD;
      blood pressure measurement, saturation, NMT, NoL).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Form, Postop-QRS test, with questions will be reviewed with the patient the day before or the&#xD;
      same day as the surgery and postoperatively. The tests are intended to measure alertness,&#xD;
      pain, nausea, vomiting and cognitive function and general recovery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The BIS index, NoL index, heart rate, blood pressure and saturation are regularly measured&#xD;
      and recorded in special protocol. (NoL blinded, these index values are stored directly from&#xD;
      the monitor on a so-called USB memory stick)&#xD;
