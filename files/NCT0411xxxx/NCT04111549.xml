      This study will use technology to deliver effective treatment for cognitive problems&#xD;
      associated with TBI to Veterans at home, which may result in improved daily functioning and&#xD;
      increased access to health care for the growing population of aging Veterans with history of&#xD;
      TBI. The successful completion of this project may also increase older Veterans' ability to&#xD;
      participate in research through increased understanding of the effect of in-home research&#xD;
      opportunities on recruitment and retention. Additionally, the evidence gathered from this&#xD;
      study may be used in future research studying home-based cognitive rehabilitation treatments&#xD;
      for Veterans using telehealth technology.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this project is to investigate the feasibility and acceptability of using&#xD;
      technology to implement home-based executive function training for aging Veterans with&#xD;
      history of traumatic brain injury (TBI).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background: Problems with attention and executive control are some of the most common&#xD;
      sequelae of TBI, and these areas of cognition are also known to be vulnerable to aging. Goal&#xD;
      Oriented Attentional Self-Regulation (GOALS) is a manualized cognitive training intervention&#xD;
      for problems with attention and executive control that has been shown to improve cognitive,&#xD;
      emotional, and functional outcomes in civilians and Veterans with history of TBI, including&#xD;
      Veterans 65 and older, and healthy older adults.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Relevance and significance to Veteran's health: TBI is prevalent among Veterans. Home-based&#xD;
      telehealth (HBT) may be an effective tool to address lack of access to health care for aging&#xD;
      Veterans.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1: Complete adaptation of the IP-GOALS protocol for a) HBT use and b) use with older&#xD;
      Veterans via collection of feedback from [n=8] Veterans 65+ with history of TBI and cognitive&#xD;
      complaints. Aim 2: Examine the feasibility (defined as recruitment yield, dropout after&#xD;
      randomization, retention, and adherence) and participant-rated acceptability of [IP and]&#xD;
      HBT-GOALS in n=36 Veterans 65+ with history of TBI and cognitive complaints. Hypothesis 2:&#xD;
      Feasibility will be demonstrated by achieving targeted recruitment goals with reasonable&#xD;
      rates of dropout after randomization, retention, and adherence, and high levels of&#xD;
      participant-rated acceptability in both groups. Aim 3: Estimate effect sizes for [HBT-GOALS&#xD;
      and IP-GOALS using a double-baseline control] on improving a) cognitive performance and&#xD;
      self-reported b) emotional regulation and c) daily functioning in the same Aim 2 study cohort&#xD;
      to inform sample size requirements for a future clinical trial. Hypothesis 3: Effect size&#xD;
      estimates will provide evidence of clinically meaningful improvement on a) cognitive&#xD;
      functioning (Attention and Executive Function Composite), b) emotional regulation (Profile of&#xD;
      Mood States Total Mood Disturbance Score), and c) daily functioning outcomes (Mayo-Portland&#xD;
      Adaptability Inventory Total Score). Exploratory analysis a) will examine whether Veteran&#xD;
      characteristics (e.g., age, sex, family/caregiver support, distance to nearest clinic, and&#xD;
      health/mobility issues including chronic pain) are associated with differences in&#xD;
      participant-rated acceptability and feasibility (i.e., recruitment yield, dropout after&#xD;
      randomization, retention and adherence), and [response to IP/HBT-GOALS vs. double baseline&#xD;
      control.] Exploratory analysis b) will examine distribution of responses to select criteria&#xD;
      to define responders in future studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: Adaptation phase (Aim 1): Adaptation of the existing GOALS protocol for a) HBT use&#xD;
      and b) use with older Veterans will be completed by collecting post-training feasibility and&#xD;
      acceptability data. Pilot phase (Aims 2 and 3 and Exploratory Analyses): Feasibility,&#xD;
      acceptability, cognitive, emotional, and daily functioning data will be collected from n=36&#xD;
      Veterans 65 or older before (baseline and delay baseline) and after participation in GOALS&#xD;
      training delivered in person (IP) or via HBT. Veterans will be randomly assigned to IP or&#xD;
      HBT. Outcome measures include participant-rated acceptability; feasibility (i.e., recruitment&#xD;
      yield, dropout after randomization, retention, and adherence); standardized and validated&#xD;
      measures of neurocognitive functioning; self-report of symptoms of depression, PTSD, mood&#xD;
      disturbance, and daily functioning.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Innovation: The proposed study is the first to investigate implementation of an established&#xD;
      cognitive rehabilitation intervention for use with aging Veterans with history of TBI and&#xD;
      delivery via in-home videoconferencing technology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Implications: This research may promote improved daily functioning for aging Veterans with&#xD;
      history of TBI through rehabilitation of executive function, and increase access to such&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
