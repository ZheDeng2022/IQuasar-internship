  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      All patients will be required to have a biopsy of a metastatic tumor deposit at study entry.&#xD;
      Pembrolizumab will be administered at a dose of 200 mg as a 30 minute IV infusion every 3&#xD;
      weeks. Enzalutamide will be continued at dose of 160 mg orally every day. Patients who have&#xD;
      neither rapid disease progression or disease response will undergo a fecal microbiota&#xD;
      transplant, have a second biopsy (if medically feasible), and be re-treated with&#xD;
      pembrolizumab.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine the anticancer effect of fecal microbiota transplant from participants who&#xD;
      respond to pembrolizumab into those who have not responded in metastatic castration resistant&#xD;
      prostate cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators propose to study the effects of fecal microbiota transplant (FMT) in&#xD;
      patients whose disease does not respond to treatment with the combination of pembrolizumab&#xD;
      and enzalutamide. Patients will remain on enzalutamide throughout the study and be treated&#xD;
      with pembrolizumab for 4 cycles. Their disease will be assessed by tumor imaging. Patients&#xD;
      whose disease responds to treatment will become stool donors to non-responders.&#xD;
      Non-responders will undergo a second biopsy (if medically feasible) and be re-treated with&#xD;
      pembrolizumab.&#xD;

    <description>INITIAL TREATMENT PHASE: Patients progressing on enzalutamide will receive 200 mg of pembrolizumab IV over 30 minutes. Treatment repeats every 3 weeks for 4 cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients continue to receive standard of care enzalutamide PO daily and androgen deprivation therapy.&#xD;
ASSESSMENT PHASE: After completion of the initial treatment phase, patients will have their disease assessed by tumor imaging. Patients who respond to treatment will become stool donors to patients who do not respond. Non-responders will move on to the retreatment phase.&#xD;
RETREATMENT PHASE: Non-responders will undergo a fecal transplant and be retreated with 200 mg of pembrolizumab IV over 30 minutes. Treatment repeats every 3 weeks for an additional 4 cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients continue to receive standard of care enzalutamide PO daily and androgen deprivation therapy.</description>

&#xD;
          2. Has known active central nervous system (CNS) metastases and/or carcinomatous&#xD;

             weeks prior to the first dose of study intervention and any neurologic symptoms have&#xD;
             returned to baseline), have no evidence of new or enlarging brain metastases, and are&#xD;
             not using steroids for at least 7 days prior to study intervention. This exception&#xD;

             adverse events due to a previously administered agent.&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Note: Participants with ≤ Grade 2 neuropathy are an exception to this criterion&#xD;
                  and may qualify for the study.&#xD;
