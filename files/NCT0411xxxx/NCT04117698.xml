  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Uveitis accounts for 15% of the causes of legal blindness. The etiological diagnosis of&#xD;
      uveitis is difficult because of the poor bacteriological performance of aqueous or vitreous&#xD;
      fluid analysis. At the end of a medical and paramedical check-up, oriented by the typology of&#xD;
      uveitis, a clinical situation is frequently encountered: idiopathic uveitis with a&#xD;
      Quantiferon test (QFN) positive orienting to an old or recent contact with tuberculosis.&#xD;
      Ocular tuberculosis is often characterized by a partial and transient response to&#xD;
      corticosteroid therapy (local or general), due to predominant hypersensitivity phenomena and&#xD;
      low inoculum. Therefore, antitubercular treatment is recommended for idiopathic posterior&#xD;
      uveitis with positive QFN. This treatment of 6-9 months has shown, in combination with&#xD;
      systemic corticosteroids, its effectiveness on ocular inflammation and significant decrease&#xD;
      in recurrence frequency.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For previous uveitis with QFN positive, there is no study or recommendation in the low&#xD;
      endemic countries on the indication of anti-tuberculosis drugs and practices are variable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tuberculous anterior uveitis is distinguished by high rate of relapses and chronic uveitis&#xD;
      upon discontinuation of topic corticosteroid therapy that exposes to broad posterior&#xD;
      synechiae leading to an ocular functional impairment. Optimizing the management of recurrent&#xD;
      anterior uveitis is therefore crucial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this prospective, randomized, controlled, open, two parallel arm trial is to&#xD;
      compared antitubercular treatment &quot;add-on &quot;of local corticosteroid therapy to Local&#xD;
      Corticosteroid Therapy Only in patients with recurrent or chronic anterior uveitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary outcome is the treatment succes defined as uveitis recovery at 3 months and the&#xD;
      absence of recurrence at 18 months of follow-up.&#xD;

    <description>Success is defined by uveitis recovery at 3 months and the absence of recurrence at 18 months of follow-up.&#xD;
The intensity of the ocular inflammation will be evaluated using the Standardization of Uveitis Nomenclature (SUN) classification (score of cellular Tyndall and &quot;Flare&quot; of the aqueous humor) Failure is therefore defined as failure to recovery at 3 months of anterior uveitis or recurrence at 18 months.</description>
