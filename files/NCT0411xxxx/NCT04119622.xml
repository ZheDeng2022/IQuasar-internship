  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Gastric cancer (GC) is one of the most common malignancies. According to the global cancer&#xD;
      statistics 2018, there were 1,033,701 new cases of gastric cancer per year, ranked the fifth&#xD;
      place in new tumors, and 782,685 deaths, ranked the second place in cancer deaths. At&#xD;
      present, surgery is the only way to cure gastric cancer, but the 5-year survival rate is only&#xD;
      20%-30%. studies have confirmed that neoadjuvant therapy could improve the R0 resection rate&#xD;
      and overall survival, which is considered a better treatment strategy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PD 1 monoclonal antibody is definitely effective in neoadjuvant therapy in other tumors such&#xD;
      as NSCLC and bladder cancer, especially in PD-L1+ patients. However, there is no research of&#xD;
      PD-1 monoclonal antibody in neoadjuvant therapy of gastric cancer. Thus we plan to conduct&#xD;
      this prospective phase II clinical trial, evaluating the safety and efficacy of toripalimab,&#xD;
      also known as JS001, in combination with XELOX for the neoadjuvant therapy of gastric cancer.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial is a single-arm, open Label, non-randomized and single-center clinical&#xD;
      study. Patients who met the study criteria will receive the combination of toripalimab (240&#xD;
      mg d1) with XELOX (oxaliplatin 130 mg/m2 QD, d1, capecitabine 1000 mg/m2 BID, d1-d14) of a&#xD;
      3-week treatment cycle up to two cycles. After the second cycle of treatment, clinical&#xD;
      efficacy evaluation will be done by MDT according to iRECIST. For patients with CR/PR/SD,&#xD;
      surgery will be performed within 4 weeks. For patients with disease progress, MDT will&#xD;
      determine whether the surgery could be performed. If resection could not be done, the&#xD;
      patients would receive Original chemotherapy with toripalimab for 1 more cycle,&#xD;
      chemoradiotherapy or the second line chemotherapy. The primary endpoint is Major pathological&#xD;
      response.&#xD;
