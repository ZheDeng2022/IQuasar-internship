  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cognitive and mobility impairments are critical contributors to dementia and disability in&#xD;
      older adults, and can be caused by neurodegenerative and neurovascular changes at the&#xD;
      pre-frontal (PF) brain areas. In a previous technological project funded by ISCiii, the&#xD;
      investigators adapted a non-invasive, point-of-care optical methods (fNRIS/fDCS technology)&#xD;
      to study PF metabolism and blood flow activation during cognitive and motor tasks, in older&#xD;
      adults with and without cognitive impairment. These methods are sensitive to change after&#xD;
      physical exercise (PE) and after selectively and safely stimulating PF areas with electrical&#xD;
      transcranial direct current stimulation (tCS). PE and tCS have shown benefits for cognition&#xD;
      and mobility in the elderly, but their prolonged effect on PF hemodynamic activation has not&#xD;
      been studied. Understanding the specific action of these interventions on the brain, and&#xD;
      their clinical cognitive and motor impact, is key to fine-tune appropriate treatment&#xD;
      strategies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The FRONT STAGE project aims to compare, through a 3 arms single-blind randomized clinical&#xD;
      trial, the impact of a 10 weeks, 1 hour/week program of PE (arm 1) Vs PE+tCS (arm 2) and Vs a&#xD;
      control group (arm 3, healthy aging sessions and control of cardiovascular risk factors). The&#xD;
      PE program is already implemented in primary care, as part of another previous project of the&#xD;
      investigators' research group. Outcomes will include the optical measurement of PF metabolism&#xD;
      and blood flow and clinical measures of cognitive and physical function. Front STAGE project&#xD;
      will recruit 93 older adults with cognitive impairment and slow gait, but without dementia or&#xD;
      disability in the activities of daily living (N=31 per arm). They will receive a&#xD;
      comprehensive geriatric assessment at baseline, together with the optical, cognitive and&#xD;
      physical measures, and will be follow-up at 3 and 6 months. Weekly physical activity through&#xD;
      accelerometry will be controlled in analyses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      FRONT STAGE project centered on aging and the prevention of dementia and disability, will&#xD;
      provide, translationally, more evidence to support and enlarge the clinical application of&#xD;
      these interventions, and will contribute to foster further research in this field.&#xD;

    <description>The Charlson Comorbidity Index is a method of categorizing comorbidities of patients based on the International Classification of Diseases (ICD) diagnosis codes found in administrative data, such as hospital abstracts data. Each comorbidity category has an associated weight (from 1 to 6), based on the adjusted risk of mortality or resource use, and the sum of all the weights results in a single comorbidity score for a patient. A score of zero indicates that no comorbidities were found. The higher the score, the more likely the predicted outcome will result in mortality or higher resource use.</description>

    <measure>Quality of sleep</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Total score of the Jenkins questionnaire will be used to estimate quality of sleep. This questionnaire consists of 4 items rated on a 6-point scale. The 4 items ask how frequently during the previous 4 weeks the respondent experienced difficulty falling asleep, difficulty staying asleep, waking up several times per night, and waking up feeling tired and worn out after the usual amount of sleep. A dichotomous index is computed and coded as 1 if the respondents reported that any of the above sleep disturbances occurred 15 or more nights during the previous 4 weeks or as 0, if not. The selection of 15 nights as the cut-off point for sleep disturbance was based on criteria from the DSM-IV-TR, which stipulate that difficulty maintaining/initiating sleep or non-restorative sleep should be present for 3 or more nights per week for at least 1 month. A similar cut-off point for sleep disturbance was used in previous studies.</description>

    <description>This arm includes 10 sessions of multi-component exercise sessions (including aerobic, resistance, flexibility, dual-tasking) of 1 hour/week of functional group exercise, directed to foster empowerment for subsequent continuation of exercise in community-dwelling older adults referred by primary care to a geriatrician and an expert physical therapist. Participants will receive a leaflet with instructions to perform five strength-based exercises and instructors will recommend participants to perform the exercises and walk at least 15 minutes daily.</description>

    <description>This arm includes 1 application/week for 10 weeks during PE, through an adapted commercial helmet. Transcranial current stimulation (tCS) is a neural stimulation technique based on electrical stimulation of selected parts of the brain with direct or alternated electrical current (tDCS or tACS) of very low intensity of 1,5 milliamps (mA), using one or more electrodes placed on the skull. tCS is non-invasive (no surgical procedures) and it is painless, as applied in the proposed protocols.</description>
