    <textblock>
      This study evaluates two methods of prescribing exercise intensity in a Phase IV cardiac&#xD;
      rehabilitation programme. One method is using specific ventilatory markers and the other&#xD;
      following standard care guidelines.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Coronary heart disease (CHD) is one of the United Kingdom's (UK) biggest killers. In the UK&#xD;
      alone 175,000 myocardial infarctions are recorded annually. While these numbers are&#xD;
      significant advances in preventative therapy and medical treatment have contributed to an&#xD;
      overall reduction in mortality in the UK. As such there is a growing need for effective&#xD;
      secondary prevention. To lower the financial burden on the National Health Service (NHS),&#xD;
      cardiac rehabilitation (CR) facilitates a systematic and multidisciplinary approach to&#xD;
      secondary prevention aimed to improve functional capacity and health-related quality of life,&#xD;
      lower rehospitalisation rates and reduce all-cause and cardiovascular mortality with exercise&#xD;
      training being the cornerstones.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A 2016 Cochrane review found benefits of exercise-based CR for patients with coronary artery&#xD;
      disease. Both cardiovascular mortality and hospital readmissions were reduced, when compared&#xD;
      with a no-exercise control. However, in contrast to previous systematic reviews and&#xD;
      meta-analyses, there was no significant reduction in risk of reinfarction or all-cause&#xD;
      mortality. Further a recent systematic review and meta-analysis (2018) found no differences&#xD;
      in outcomes between exercise-based CR and a no-exercise control at their longest follow-up&#xD;
      period for: all-cause mortality or cardiovascular mortality. The authors also found a small&#xD;
      reduction in hospital admissions of borderline statistical significance. One possible answer&#xD;
      to the above findings is the under dosage of exercise intensity and duration in UK CR. A&#xD;
      recent multicentre study of routine UK-based CR (current clinical practice) indicated that&#xD;
      the 'exercise dose' within outpatient UK CR may be insufficient to meaningfully improve&#xD;
      cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) when compared with international programmes. Given the&#xD;
      prognostic relevance of improving CRF and that exercise and physical activity has a&#xD;
      'dose-response' relationship with cardiovascular disease risk, these findings may explain why&#xD;
      UK CR programmes do not appear to improve patient survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
      UK-based guidelines advocate a percentage range-based method for prescribing exercise&#xD;
      intensity. However, there are a number of limitations of this method. The investigators and&#xD;
      others have recently shown that prescribing exercise intensity using percentage heart rate&#xD;
      reserve (%HRR) can lead to patients receiving different exercise training doses from what&#xD;
      would be historically viewed as the same exercise training intervention. Prescribing exercise&#xD;
      based on %HRR ignores the important role that metabolic perturbations play in stimulating&#xD;
      physiological adaptation in response to exercise training. The ventilatory anaerobic&#xD;
      threshold (VAT) is an important objective metabolic threshold that indicates when&#xD;
      incrementally greater contributions from anaerobic metabolism are required to sustain further&#xD;
      increases in workload. The VAT has been proposed as a minimum exercise training intensity&#xD;
      that must be exceeded in order to improve aerobic fitness. Compelling data has shown that the&#xD;
      occurrence of the VAT is patient-specific, and can occur at different percentage of a&#xD;
      patient's HRR. Basing an exercise training programme on estimated, or even directly measured&#xD;
      %HRR could therefore result in heart rate training zones being set either above, or below the&#xD;
      VAT. Patients who are prescribed the 'same' exercise training programme based on %HRR could&#xD;
      be exposed to different metabolic stimuli and therefore a different exercise training dose.&#xD;
      This may explain why some patients appear to 'respond' to a treatment, whilst others may be&#xD;
      classified as &quot;non-responders.&quot; Prescribing exercise that can improve CRF for patients&#xD;
      attending CR is essential, and greater consideration for how exercise is prescribed in a&#xD;
      community-based setting is required.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Given the VAT is a significant threshold, with evidence reporting it to be a superior method,&#xD;
      comparisons to the %HRR method are limited in clinical populations. As such the primary focus&#xD;
      of the study is to compare the effectiveness of a threshold-based model (ventilatory&#xD;
      threshold) versus a relative percent model (%HRR) for improving cardiorespiratory fitness in&#xD;
      patient attending Phase IV community based cardiac rehabilitation.&#xD;
