  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Ankle sprain is very common. In France, its daily incidence is estimated at 6000. It often&#xD;
      causes pain, a temporary period of disability and can results in recurrence and chronic ankle&#xD;
      instability. Therefore, an early management and follow up treatment is necessary. Now,&#xD;
      functional treatment is clinically the treatment strategy of choice for ankle sprain. It is&#xD;
      based on rest, ice, compression, elevation and can use a functional support (like an ankle&#xD;
      brace). To evaluate gravity and improve management, a clinical assessment delayed between 4&#xD;
      and 5 days post injury is necessary.&#xD;
