    <textblock>
      The goal of the current pragmatic trial is to evaluate the impact of a simple method of&#xD;
      selecting a treatment approach for identified mutations on participants' progression free&#xD;
      survival (PFS). The study also intends to collect information on barriers that investigators&#xD;
      encounter when prescribing treatment options using the Next Generation Sequencing (NGS)&#xD;
      reports. Additionally, patients' quality of life will be measured before, after, and during&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be followed until death for monitoring survival study endpoints.&#xD;

      Primary Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      â€¢ To estimate the progression-free ratio, as defined by the progression-free survival time on&#xD;
      study treatment divided by the progression-free survival time on the last treatment received&#xD;
      by patient, for an identified actionable mutation, who will be treated with an off-label&#xD;
      treatment off label therapy based on a simplified selection methodology using the Next&#xD;
      Generation Sequencing results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To estimate patient response rate on off-label treatments for actionable mutations based&#xD;
           on Next Generation Sequencing results.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To estimate overall survival (OS) for patients treated with off-label treatments for&#xD;
           actionable mutations based on Next Generation Sequencing results.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To describe the safety of using off-label or other experimental treatments for patients&#xD;
           with actionable mutations based on Next Generation Sequencing results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exploratory Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To describe health related quality of life in patients undergoing off-label treatment&#xD;
           targeting genetic mutations, as measured by the PROMIS-29 Overall Health-Related Quality&#xD;
           of Life, Including 4-Item Anxiety Subscale.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Using the Satisfaction with Medical Decision Scale, to describe patient satisfaction&#xD;
           with decision to pursue off-label treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To identify types of actionable mutations with available targeted treatment occurring in&#xD;
           cancer patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To characterize the historical treatment regimens for these patients relative to the&#xD;
           targetable mutation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To describe patient clinical and demographic characteristics of those with actionable&#xD;
           mutations based on Next Generation Sequencing results.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To identify barriers to treatment based on Next Generation Sequencing results.&#xD;

    <description>Estimation of progression-free ratio defined as the duration of time from start of treatment to the time of progression divided by the duration of time from the last treatment received pre-trial to the time of progression on that treatment. The median progression-free ratio will be estimated with the range and a two-sided Wilcoxon Signed Rank test will be calculated to see if the progression free survival ratio is different from 1.0. This trial is powered to detect differences in the progression-free ratio for those with actionable mutations identified by NGS results and then treated with a targeted therapy. A hypothesized PFS ratio larger than 1.3 would suggest that the targeted therapy is doing better than the previous treatment received (not targeted), and we assume a null hypothesis PFS ratio of 1.0 (no difference).</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Cancer patients at Wake Forest Baptist Comprehensive Cancer Center and its satellites&#xD;
             who have next generation DNA sequencing results on their tumor biopsy or surgically&#xD;
             resected tissue and/or blood samples and/or consent to the Wake Forest Comprehensive&#xD;
             Cancer Center Precision Oncology Registry to use their information for research.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Actionable mutation (defined as a mutation or gene amplification for which an&#xD;
             off-label therapy is identified on the patient's NGS report for which NCCN guidelines&#xD;
             do not recommend a specific treatment in the particular disease or for which there is&#xD;
             no documentation in the patient's medical record of clinical data demonstrating lack&#xD;
             of activity with the targeting of the specific mutation or amplification in the&#xD;
             patient's specific disease) uncovered by the genomic sequencing of a tumor or those&#xD;
             that have undergone liquid biopsy assay of their tumor genomic, performed by Wake&#xD;
             Forest or another and who are medically able to receive targeted therapy based on&#xD;
             those results.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Sequencing on a sample collected within 3 months prior to registration is strongly&#xD;
             encouraged but must have been performed within the 12 months prior to registration.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have progressed through at least two lines of treatment, or are not&#xD;
             candidates for or unwilling to receive any standard therapies. Patients who have&#xD;
             received treatment on the present protocol who have progression of disease may be&#xD;
             recruited to the trial for treatment using another targeted therapy provided that they&#xD;
             fulfill the other criteria for participation in the trial. If a patient discontinues&#xD;
             treatment on this protocol they can be considered for further participation in this&#xD;
             trial provided they meet all of the eligibility criteria and are eligible for&#xD;
             re-registration and re-consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) of less than or equal to 3&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Life expectancy of greater than 6 weeks&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The effects of the drugs used for cancer treatment on the developing human fetus are&#xD;
             unknown. For this reason and because of the possibility that the agents are&#xD;
             teratogenic, women of child-bearing potential and men must agree to use adequate&#xD;
             contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study&#xD;
             entry and for the duration of study participation. Should a woman become pregnant or&#xD;
             suspect she is pregnant while participating in this study, she should inform her&#xD;
             treating physician immediately.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have had or will receive chemotherapy or radiotherapy to major bone&#xD;
             marrow bearing sites within 2 weeks prior to receiving treatment on the study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have not recovered from toxicity of prior treatment if such toxicity will&#xD;
             preclude treatment with the proposed targeted agent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients may not be receiving any other investigational agents.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to ongoing or active&#xD;
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac&#xD;
             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with&#xD;
             study requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because of the potential for teratogenic&#xD;
             or abortifacient effects. Because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse&#xD;
             events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with the targeted&#xD;
             agent, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated with the targeted&#xD;
             agent.&#xD;
