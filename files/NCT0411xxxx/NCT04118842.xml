  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase I, open-label, 3 treatment period, fixed-sequence study in healthy&#xD;
      non-Japanese male subjects, aged 18 to 65 years (inclusive), performed at a single study&#xD;
      centre. Treatment Period 1 will establish the single dose pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of&#xD;
      savolitinib. Dosing of daily rifampicin during Treatment Period 2 will result in maximal&#xD;
      induction of the CYP450 enzymes including CYP3A4. Treatment Period 3 will then establish the&#xD;
      single dose PK profile of savolitinib under maximum CYP450 induction conditions. Comparison&#xD;
      of the PK profile of savolitinib between Treatment Period 1 and Treatment Period 3 will&#xD;
      quantify the effect of CYP450 enzyme induction.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The treatment starts with a single dose of savolitinib (Treatment Period 1), followed by a&#xD;
      washout period at least of 14 days after savolitinib dosing and before the start of Treatment&#xD;
      Period 2, followed by rifampicin administration for 5 days (Treatment Period 2), and lastly,&#xD;
      a combination of savolitinib + rifampicin (Treatment Period 3). Overall, all subjects will&#xD;
      receive 2 single doses of 600 mg savolitinib and 7 daily doses of 600 mg rifampicin. Subjects&#xD;
      will be resident in the study centre when receiving study drug administrations (savolitinib&#xD;
      [Treatment Period 1], rifampicin [Treatment Period 2] and savolitinib+rifampicin [Treatment&#xD;
      Period 3]). Subjects are required to fast overnight before each dosing day. Rifampicin will&#xD;
      be administered 1 hour before breakfast with 240 mL water. The subjects will need to complete&#xD;
      high-fat, high calorie breakfast before administration of savolitinib in Treatment Period 1,&#xD;
      Day 1 (Study Day 1) and Treatment Period 3 Day 1 (Study Day 20).&#xD;
