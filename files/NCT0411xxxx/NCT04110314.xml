  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This trial is taking place in Los Angeles, CA among patients from primary care practices&#xD;
      within the UCLA Health System.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommendation in 2010 that&#xD;
      all people above 6 months of age should receive an annual flu vaccine, vaccination rates&#xD;
      remain low. The investigators will assess the effectiveness of message-framing (gain-framed,&#xD;
      loss-framed messages, no messages), as well as the effectiveness of a pre-commitment prompt&#xD;
      (pre-commitment prompt, no prompt) asking about a patient's intention to get the influenza&#xD;
      vaccination, using a 3 x 2 factorial design.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Sub-optimal vaccination rates are a significant problem in the U.S., despite their&#xD;
      effectiveness in preventing morbidity and mortality from vaccine-preventable illness. For&#xD;
      influenza specifically, annual epidemics of influenza cause substantial morbidity in the U.S.&#xD;
      with up to 40,00-80,000 deaths/year and many hospitalizations, emergency and outpatient&#xD;
      visits, and significant costs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Reminder/recall (R/R), sent by phone, mail or other modality, can improve child and adult&#xD;
      influenza vaccination rates. However, the majority of pediatric or adult primary care&#xD;
      practices to not conduct R/R. Barriers are lack of finances, personnel, and algorithms to&#xD;
      identify eligible patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A technological breakthrough that might overcome these barriers involves patient portals--&#xD;
      secure, web-based communication systems, embedded within electronic health records (EHRs),&#xD;
      for patients and providers to communicate with each other via email and the internet. Portals&#xD;
      are used by about half of Americans and half of UCLA patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There has been considerable research on how best to communicate about vaccines with families.&#xD;
      A number of studies have examined the impact of gain-framed (messages emphasizing the&#xD;
      benefits of vaccination) versus loss-framed (messages emphasizing the risks of not getting&#xD;
      vaccinated); however, the findings have been inconsistent across studies and by&#xD;
      sub-population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to framing, another potential influence on the decision to vaccinate is&#xD;
      pre-commitment. Previous studies suggest that, upon being prompted, indicating an intention&#xD;
      to do something increases the likelihood of following through. Therefore, a pre-commitment&#xD;
      prompt is being asked of half the participants in each arm to evaluate its impact on&#xD;
      influenza vaccination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this randomized controlled trial is to evaluate the impact of gain-framed and&#xD;
      loss-framed reminder-recall messages sent via the patient portal, pre-commitment prompts sent&#xD;
      via the patient portal, and the interactions between the two type of messages and&#xD;
      pre-commitment on influenza vaccination among UCLA Health System's primary care patients aged&#xD;
      6 months and older.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed design of this randomized-controlled trial is a 3 x 2 factorial design.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Standard of care control (no reminder messages, no pre-commitment prompt) No portal messages,&#xD;
      pre-commitment prompt Gain-framed portal messages, pre-commitment prompt Gain-framed portal&#xD;
      messages, no pre-commitment prompt Loss-framed portal messages, pre-commitment prompt&#xD;
      Loss-framed portal messages, no pre-commitment prompt&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hyp 1. Vaccination rates will differ by receipt of no reminders, gain-framed reminders and&#xD;
      loss-framed reminders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      1a. Vaccination rates will be higher among patients receiving gain-framed reminders than&#xD;
      among patients receiving no reminders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      1b. Vaccination rates will be higher among patients receiving loss-framed reminders than&#xD;
      among patients receiving no reminders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      1c. Vaccination rates will be higher among patients receiving gain-framed reminders than&#xD;
      among patients receiving loss-framed reminders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hyp 2. Vaccination rates will be higher among patients receiving a pre-commitment prompt than&#xD;
      among patients not receiving any prompt.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For relevant study arms, the first R/R messages will be sent in October 2019.&#xD;

    <description>Receipt of the annual influenza vaccination (between 10/2/19 - 4/1/20) among index patients. Outcomes will be assessed via vaccine data extraction from the electronic health record and external claims and pharmacy data.&#xD;
Index patients will be randomly selected individuals within an included household, eligible for the following groups (age &lt;18, 18-64 non-diabetic, 65+ non-diabetic, and 18+ diabetic). One index patient per group may be selected from each household.&#xD;
The index patients must also be an active UCLA Health MyChart user (&gt;= 1 login over the last 12 months from 8/1/19, excluding activity on the user's initial profile activation date). Individuals not affiliated with any primary care practice will be excluded from the primary analysis.</description>
