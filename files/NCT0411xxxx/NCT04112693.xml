  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Achalasia is a primary esophageal motility disorder characterized on high-resolution&#xD;
      manometry (HRM) studies by 100% failed peristalsis and elevated integrated relaxation&#xD;
      pressure of the lower esophageal sphincter. It is further divided into 3 sub-types according&#xD;
      to the Chicago classification v3.01. The pathophysiology of achalasia is poorly understood;&#xD;
      however, the NGEU is increasingly recognized as playing a key role in the development of this&#xD;
      disorder. Similarly, the esophageal muscle tissue is probably involved, but its sampling&#xD;
      remained challenging until the recent advent of the POEM procedure. Indeed, it is now&#xD;
      possible, easy and safe to take biopsies of the muscle tissue during POEM. Therefore, POEM&#xD;
      not only represents an innovative and effective treatment for achalasia, but also an&#xD;
      opportunity to better understand its underlying pathophysiological mechanisms. Currently&#xD;
      available treatments for achalasia (pneumatic dilation (PD), Heller's myotomy (HM), botox&#xD;
      injections, POEM) are &quot;palliative&quot; procedures that do not restore normal contractile function&#xD;
      of the esophagus, but a better understanding of the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying&#xD;
      this disorder could potentially help developing curative, or even preventative treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To date, muscle tissue sampled during a POEM has only been characterized qualitatively&#xD;
      (normal, atrophic, hypertrophic) with no assessment of the enteric nervous system. Moreover,&#xD;
      there has been no studies of the mucosal or NGEU anomalies on biopsies taken during a&#xD;
      minimally invasive procedure for achalasia such as a POEM.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aims to evaluate the feasibility of the assessment of NGEU and esophageal muscle&#xD;
      tissue in biopsies taken during a POEM for achalasia. It also aims to determine whether&#xD;
      specific biomarkers within the NGEU and muscle tissue can predict a better therapeutic&#xD;
      response to a POEM. The goal is to include 30 patients within 12 months. Given that&#xD;
      approximately 100 new cases of achalasia are diagnosed each year at the included centers, and&#xD;
      that about 50% of treatment-naive patients are offered and accept to undergo a POEM,&#xD;
      recruitment should be completed relatively rapidly. All POEMs will be performed at the CHU de&#xD;
      Nantes by a single endoscopist who has already performed more than 100 procedures. Other than&#xD;
      the complications related to the POEM itself, the addition of 14 esophageal biopsies required&#xD;
      for our study is a very low-risk intervention. Biopsy sampling extends the length of the&#xD;
      procedure by only 4-5 minutes and has not been associated with an increased risk of&#xD;
      complications in a previous study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be evaluated at five time points: preinclusion visit (up to four months before&#xD;
      the POEM), inclusion visit (day of the POEM), post-POEM phone calls (3-6, 9-12, 22-26 months&#xD;
      after POEM). During the preinclusion visit, relevant information regarding&#xD;
      inclusion/exclusion criteria, consent, HRM and pH impedance results, past medical history,&#xD;
      and pregnancy status (if applicable) will be gathered. At each time point, current medical&#xD;
      history, Eckhardt score2 and pH impedance results (if available) will be documented. The&#xD;
      patient will also answer the quality of life (SF36)3 and nutritional status questionnaires&#xD;
      and will undergo blood sampling for albumin and prealbumin levels. Additionally, on the day&#xD;
      of the POEM, there will be another blood sampling for complete blood count, PT, APTT, serum&#xD;
      electrolytes and CRP level. Finally, at each post-POEM phone calls, the occurrence of adverse&#xD;
      events will be reported.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our primary hypothesis is that the analysis of mucosal and muscle tissue biopsies taken&#xD;
      safely during a POEM will allow better characterization of transcriptomic and molecular&#xD;
      remodeling of the mucosa (especially the NGEU) and the muscularis propria in achalasia. We&#xD;
      also hypothesize that these anomalies could eventually serve as treatment targets and as a&#xD;
      way of better stratifying patients according to achalasia type and treatment (in our case,&#xD;
      POEM) response.&#xD;
