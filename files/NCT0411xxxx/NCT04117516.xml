      Background: Carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) is the most common compressive neuropathy in the&#xD;
      upper limb, with a prevalence of around 1'14% and 14'4% of the population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The clinical symptoms are usually pain, paresthesias and numbness on the sensitive&#xD;
      distribution territory of the median nerve in the hand.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Conservative treatment is used for the mild cases, and surgery for the moderate and severe&#xD;
      ones, or when the conservative treatment has failed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Open carpal tunnel release is the gold standard surgery, with a short longitudinal volar&#xD;
      approach that allows to visualize the complete division of the ligament.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Over the last few years, endoscopic techniques have been introduced, offering some advantages&#xD;
      such as: lower postoperative pain, earlier return to work and less complications due to the&#xD;
      wound. Despite this, it has not been popularised, probably, because it is a challenging and&#xD;
      more expensive surgical procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on the minimally invasive endoscopic approach, and with the aim of obtaining the same&#xD;
      benefits, and avoid the complications of the open surgery, several devices have been&#xD;
      developed to perform a percutaneous release.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: Percutaneous ambulatory carpal tunnel release offers similar outcomes to the open&#xD;
      approach in the theatre.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design: Two-groups randomized single-blind interventional non-inferiority clinical&#xD;
      trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: Sixty patients reporting CTS symptoms, that are confirmed by clinical exam and nerve&#xD;
      conduction studies, will be included. Participants will be randomized in two arms. Patients&#xD;
      from one group will be operated with an open carpal tunnel release, in the theatre, with&#xD;
      tourniquet, under local anesthesia and sedation, through a short longitudinal volar&#xD;
      &quot;classical&quot; approach of the hand, that allows to visualize the complete division of the&#xD;
      ligament. The other group will be operated with a percutaneous approach, ambulatory, with a&#xD;
      short transverse volar approach, 1-2cm proximal to the wrist, under Wide Awake Local&#xD;
      Anesthesia with No Tourniquet.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main outcome measures will be the Boston Carpal Tunnel Questionnaire, Quick DASH&#xD;
      questionnaire, Douleur Neuropathique 4 questions, Visual Numeric Scale and grip strength. The&#xD;
      scales and questionnaires will be administrated to participants preoperative, 4 weeks and 24&#xD;
      weeks postoperative.&#xD;
