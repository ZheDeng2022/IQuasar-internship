    <textblock>
      The EMISI trial is a randomized, double blind, controlled trial (RCT) using a factorial&#xD;
      design in patients with a new low back pain episode. The study aims to assess (A) whether&#xD;
      metamizole, a non-opioid drug approved in Switzerland for pain treatment, is non-inferior to&#xD;
      ibuprofen in a new episode of acute or subacute LBP and (B) whether a short educational&#xD;
      intervention including evidence-based patient information is superior to usual care alone.&#xD;
      Despite its increased use, the role of metamizole for the treatment of LBP is unclear and has&#xD;
      so far not been systematically studied.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Purpose Low back pain (LBP) is among the top three most common diseases worldwide resulting&#xD;
      in a life with pain-related disability. In patients with persistent LBP over 3 months, the&#xD;
      risk for chronic pain increases dramatically and effective interventions should aim to&#xD;
      prevent pain persistence without overtreatment. Therefore, during an acute LBP episode, the&#xD;
      most common recommendations are to use pain medication to alleviate pain and to keep patients&#xD;
      physically active. Non-opioid and opioid pain medication is increasingly used to control&#xD;
      pain. Despite the frequency of LBP, only few high-quality studies assessed the efficacy of&#xD;
      pain medication. Since the 1990s, the use of opioid pain medication for non-cancer pain has&#xD;
      soared and resulted in an epidemic of opioid dependence and abuse in the U.S. This, despite&#xD;
      the fact that randomized clinical trials found little or no additional efficacy of opioids&#xD;
      compared to non-opioid medication in LBP. Moreover, opioids are associated with potentially&#xD;
      severe side-effects, including confusion, sedation, respiratory depression and dependence.&#xD;
      Therefore, non-opioid pain medications that are safe and effective are urgently needed to&#xD;
      control pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are considered to be effective for LBP and&#xD;
      recommended by guidelines. However, adverse events including kidney injury and&#xD;
      gastrointestinal bleeding, limit the use of NSAIDs in many patients. Metamizole is an&#xD;
      effective non-opioid analgesic and antipyretic with a favorable gastrointestinal and renal&#xD;
      safety profile and therefore, a valuable treatment option in many LBP patients with&#xD;
      contraindications for NSAIDs. Metamizole has been increasingly used in many countries such as&#xD;
      Germany, France, Spain, and Switzerland. Despite its increased use, the role of metamizole&#xD;
      for the treatment of LBP is unclear and has so far not been systematically studied. This&#xD;
      surprising lack of efficacy data may be due to an ongoing controversy over the risk of&#xD;
      metamizole-associated agranulocytosis, a serious hematological adverse event. Even though the&#xD;
      overall risk of agranulocytosis is increased compared to other drugs, it only occurs in a&#xD;
      small proportion of susceptible patients and the overall safety profile of metamizole is&#xD;
      still favorable compared to other analgesics such as NSAIDs or opioids, which carry their own&#xD;
      specific risks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Many patients have reservations against regular intake of pain medication and limit physical&#xD;
      activity to keep pain manageable without medication, which is against the guidelines'&#xD;
      recommendation. However, education to encourage activity may help to improve pain control and&#xD;
      function as well. In a busy primary care practice extended educational sessions that have&#xD;
      been shown to be effective are not feasible. A short educational intervention that provides&#xD;
      evidence-based information on the nature of LBP and promotes physical activity may also&#xD;
      improve outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives This study aims to assess (A) whether metamizole is non-inferior to ibuprofen in a&#xD;
      new episode of acute or subacute LBP and (B) whether a short educational intervention&#xD;
      including evidence-based patient information is superior to usual care alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods The EMISI trial is a randomized, double-blind, controlled trial (RCT) using a&#xD;
      factorial design recruiting patients consulting general practitioners (GP) practices and the&#xD;
      outpatient Division of the Department of General Internal Medicine at the University Hospital&#xD;
      Bern, Switzerland. Patients are randomized into one of four groups (1:1:1:1): metamizole +&#xD;
      educational intervention vs. metamizole + standard care vs. ibuprofen + educational&#xD;
      intervention vs. ibuprofen + standard care. Patients assigned to the educational information&#xD;
      will receive an information leaflet and a phone call by a member of the research team to&#xD;
      discuss evidence based information on LBP. All patients will receive usual care provided by&#xD;
      their GPs that includes additional pain medications and non-pharmacological measures at the&#xD;
      GPs discretion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome (A) Comparison of ibuprofen vs. metamizole: change from baseline pain on&#xD;
      the numeric rating scale (NRS) to day 14 (non-inferiority).&#xD;
&#xD;
      B) Comparison of the short intervention vs. usual care: change from baseline Core Outcome&#xD;
      Measures Index (COMI) sum-score to 42 days follow-up (superiority).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis Analysis will include an intention-to-treat (ITT) and a per-protocol&#xD;
      (PP) analysis for the comparison of the primary between metamizole and ibuprofen outcome (NRS&#xD;
      change from baseline to follow-up at 14 days). Both analyses need to meet non-inferiority in&#xD;
      order to claim success. The comparison of the primary outcome between the intervention and&#xD;
      the usual care group (COMI change from baseline to day 42) will be performed according to&#xD;
      intention-to-treat principle. Based on the sample size calculation for both interventions,&#xD;
      120 patients will be included into the study.&#xD;
