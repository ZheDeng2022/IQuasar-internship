  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      An observational prospective study to determine the impact of foam sclerotherapy of large,&#xD;
      dominant kidney/liver cysts on quality of life outcomes and kidney/liver cyst volumes at up&#xD;
      to 12 months of follow-up in patients with autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease&#xD;
      (ADPKD) and autosomal dominant polycystic liver disease (ADPLD).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cyst burden is an important determinant of outcomes in both autosomal dominant polycystic&#xD;
      kidney disease (ADPKD) (1, 2) and autosomal dominant polycystic liver disease (ADPLD) (3, 4).&#xD;
      Furthermore, mass symptoms (from liver and kidney volume) greatly impact upon quality of life&#xD;
      in patients with severe disease. Cyst volume increases exponentially with age and results in&#xD;
      the development of end-stage renal disease and hypertension, compromised quality of life due&#xD;
      to compressive symptoms, and predisposes patients to cyst complications such as infection,&#xD;
      hemorrhage, rupture, and torsion. Existing percutaneous treatments for cyst burden in ADPKD&#xD;
      and ADPLD include cyst aspiration with or without sclerotherapy. Although frequently&#xD;
      effective in the short-term, recurrence rates and the need for repeat procedures are high&#xD;
      after these procedures (5, 6). Extrarenal disease (primarily liver disease) is the most&#xD;
      important aspect of disease burden to ADPKD patients (7), and there are few effective&#xD;
      treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Foam sclerotherapy (FS) with 3% Sodium Tetradecyl Sulfate (STS) a sclerosing agent.&#xD;
      (Sotradecol®; Mylan, Galway, Ireland) is approved by the FDA for the management of varicose&#xD;
      veins. While increasing cyst burden significantly compromises quality of life, the impact of&#xD;
      FS on patient-reported outcomes has not been evaluated. In collaboration with the Center for&#xD;
      Science of Healthcare delivery, we have developed a patient-reported outcome tool for&#xD;
      polycystic liver disease capable of detecting symptom burden in individuals with polycystic&#xD;
      liver disease that has been approved by the FDA as a patient-reported outcomes tool in&#xD;
      research. Furthermore measurement of liver and kidney volumes can be performed in the&#xD;
      Polycystic Kidney Disease Imaging Research Core that monitors organ volumes before and after&#xD;
      interventions. At this time, patients are interested in procedures that will alleviate and&#xD;
      palliate their mass symptoms but desire preliminary information on the procedural efficacy.&#xD;
      We aim to report our experience with a new therapeutic advance - FS for the treatment of&#xD;
      liver and kidney cysts at Mayo Clinic - and to determine the impact of this procedure on&#xD;
      patient-reported quality of life measures and changes in organ volumes.&#xD;
