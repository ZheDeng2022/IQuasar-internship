  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is being done because, despite major advances in therapy, MM is still considered&#xD;
      an incurable disease. The purpose of this study is to determine the efficacy (how well it&#xD;
      works) of the study treatment that combines the following drugs: daratumumab, carfilzomib,&#xD;
      lenalidomide, dexamethasone in subjects who have a recent diagnosis of multiple myeloma (MM).&#xD;
      Normal plasma (blood) cells are found in the bone marrow and are an important part of the&#xD;
      immune system. MM is a cancer formed by malignant (cancerous) plasma cells. Daratumumab, one&#xD;
      of the study drugs, is a man-made protein that works with your immune system by attaching&#xD;
      itself to the cancerous cells. Once daratumumab attaches itself to these cells, it gets your&#xD;
      body's immune system to attack and destroy the MM cells. Daratumumab has shown to be&#xD;
      effective in subjects with MM when combined with medicines like bortezomib, or lenalidomide +&#xD;
      dexamethasone.&#xD;

      This single arm, two-stage, open-label Phase II study is designed with the primary objective&#xD;
      of evaluating the efficacy of induction therapy comprised of 8 cycles of carfilzomib,&#xD;
      lenalidomide, dexamethasone and daratumumab (KRd+daratumumab) in terms of complete response&#xD;
      or better (CR) in subjects with NDMM, and comparing to relevant historical controls. Post&#xD;
      induction, all subjects will undergo disease evaluation, including assessment of minimal&#xD;
      residual disease (MRD). Post-induction disease evaluation will be followed by an MRD-based&#xD;
      treatment algorithm. This trial will allow us to gather preliminary data on use of MRD status&#xD;
      to direct post-induction therapy.&#xD;

             must have recovered from treatment-induced toxicities to ≤ grade 1 or baseline.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Demonstrate adequate organ function within 1 week of day 1 of treatment as defined in&#xD;
             the table below:&#xD;

             Renal:&#xD;
&#xD;
             Serum creatinine with Creatinine clearance : ≤ 1.5 × upper limit of normal (ULN) with&#xD;
             creatinine clearance&#xD;
&#xD;
             ≥ 30 mL/min as measured by a 24-hour urine collection or estimated by the Cockcroft -&#xD;
             Gault formula ( See formula in Appendix B, Section 18.2 )&#xD;
&#xD;
             Hepatic:&#xD;

&#xD;
          9. Females of childbearing potential (FCBP) must have a negative serum pregnancy test&#xD;
             (minimum sensitivity 25 IU/L or equivalent units of HCG) within 24 hours prior to day&#xD;
             1 of treatment, and be willing to undergo serial serum or urine pregnancy testing.&#xD;
             NOTE: Females are considered of child bearing potential unless they are surgically&#xD;
             sterile (have undergone a hysterectomy, bilateral tubal ligation, or bilateral&#xD;
             oophorectomy) or are postmenopausal (at least 12 consecutive months with no menses&#xD;
             without an alternative medical cause).&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. FCBP must be willing to use a highly effective contraceptive method (i.e., achieves a&#xD;
             failure rate of &lt;1% per year when used consistently and correctly) plus a second&#xD;
             contraceptive method (considered acceptable [failure rate of &gt;1% per year] or highly&#xD;
             effective) from the time of informed consent until 3 months after the last protocol&#xD;
             prescribed therapy (which also includes FCBP on carfilzomib) has been discontinued.&#xD;
             NOTE: estrogens may further increase the risk of thrombosis (beyond that associated&#xD;
             with lenalidomide) and their use should be based on a benefit-risk decision. For the&#xD;
             highly effective contraceptive method, a method with low user dependency is preferable&#xD;
             but not required (see tables, adapted from:&#xD;
             http://www.hma.eu/fileadmin/dateien/Human_Medicines/01-About_HMA/Working_Groups/CTFG/2&#xD;
             014_09_HMA_CTFG_Contraception.pdf)&#xD;
&#xD;
             Highly Effective Birth Control Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  combined (estrogen and progestogen containing) hormonal contraception associated&#xD;
                  with inhibition of ovulation&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  oral&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  intravaginal&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  transdermal&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  progestogen-only hormonal contraception associated with inhibition of ovulation&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  oral&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  injectable&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  implantable (Contraception method considered to have low user dependency)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  intrauterine devide (IUD) (Contraception method considered to have low user&#xD;
                  dependency)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  intrauterine hormone-releasing system (IUS) (Contraception method considered to&#xD;
                  have low user dependency)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  vasectomised partner (Contraception method considered to have low user&#xD;
                  dependency) Vasectomised partner is a highly effective birth control method&#xD;
                  provided that partner is the sole sexual partner of the FCBP trial participant&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  sexual abstinence (Sexual abstinence is considered a highly effective method only&#xD;
                  if defined as refraining from heterosexual intercourse during the entire period&#xD;
                  of risk associated with the study treatments)&#xD;
&#xD;
             Acceptable Birth Control Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Progestogen-only oral hormonal contraception, where inhibition of ovulation is&#xD;
                  not the primary mode of action&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Male or female condom with or without spermicide (A combination of male condom&#xD;
                  with either cap, diaphragm or sponge with spermicide (double barrier methods) are&#xD;
                  also considered acceptable, but not highly effective, birth control methods.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Male subjects (even those who have had a vasectomy) who are sexually active with a&#xD;
             FCBP must be willing to use latex or synthetic condoms from initiation of study&#xD;
             treatment until 3 months after the last protocol prescribed therapy has been&#xD;
             discontinued. They must also refrain from donating sperm for at least 90 days after&#xD;
             the last dose of carfilzomib and at least 90 days from the last dose of daratumumab.&#xD;
             The FCBP partner should also consider contraception recommendations (see inclusion&#xD;
             #10).&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. As determined by the enrolling physician, ability of the subject to understand and&#xD;
             comply with study procedures for the entire length of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Subjects meeting any of the criteria below may not participate in the study:&#xD;
