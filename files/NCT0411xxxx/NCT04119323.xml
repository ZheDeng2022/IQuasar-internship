  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, multi-site, non-randomized, data collection study. The purpose of this&#xD;
      study is to investigate the correlation between pacing sites and ECG morphology or pacing&#xD;
      parameters during left bundle branch pacing (LBBP) and perform the use condition analysis to&#xD;
      assess the long-term performance of pacing lead during LBBP.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      His bundle pacing (HBP) is a physiological pacing, but also has some limitations, including&#xD;
      high and unstable pacing threshold in 5-10% patients, low R-wave amplitude causing&#xD;
      inappropriate pacing management, damage to the His bundle during implantation. On the other&#xD;
      hand, left bundle branch pacing (LBBP), achieved via trans-ventricular septal approach with&#xD;
      the pacing lead tip at the left side of the ventricular septum, has recently initiated and&#xD;
      been widely practiced in China because of easy implantation, relatively narrow paced QRS&#xD;
      duration, low and stable pacing threshold, high R wave amplitude, and the LBBB correction by&#xD;
      a low pacing output.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As LBBP is in the early phase of clinical practice in China, in order to better conduct LBBP&#xD;
      implantation and understand mechanisms of LBBP therapy, physicians often do imaging&#xD;
      assessment of the pacing lead in patients implanted with LBBP based on clinical necessity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additionally, there is no report of mid/long-term correlation between lead location and&#xD;
      ventricular electrical activity, nor mid/long-term pacing lead performance assessment during&#xD;
      LBBP.&#xD;
