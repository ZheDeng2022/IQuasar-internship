      This study will assess the effects of moderate vs. high intensity aerobic exercise, performed&#xD;
      3 times a week for 12 weeks under supervised conditions, on symptoms of depression, cognitive&#xD;
      functioning and brain function in transitional aged youth (TAY: aged 16-24 years).&#xD;

      Rationale: Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a debilitating disorder characterized by&#xD;
      persistent negative mood and a broad range of cognitive, and functional impairments. MDD is&#xD;
      estimated to affect 4.4% of the global population, or over 300 million individuals,&#xD;
      representing the single largest contributor to non-fatal health loss worldwide. Current&#xD;
      treatment options are associated with sub-optimal rates of remission, with only 30-35% of MDD&#xD;
      sufferers attaining remission with antidepressant drug monotherapy. One group for whom&#xD;
      treatment selection is a particular challenge is transitional aged youth (TAY), encompassing&#xD;
      the late teenage years into the early twenties. Although MDD onset typically occurs during&#xD;
      this period - as high as 8.2% in Canadian TAY - the psychiatric community has only recently&#xD;
      begun to recognize TAY as a unique psychiatric cohort in need of directed treatment. For&#xD;
      example, although the use selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) is the first-line&#xD;
      treatment for MDD in adults, their utility in TAY is hampered by the possibility of increased&#xD;
      suicidal ideation within this cohort. The need for alternative and tailored treatment options&#xD;
      for TAY with MDD is therefore of paramount importance. Aerobic exercise (AE) has recently&#xD;
      been recognized as one such intervention, with some reports showing outcomes comparable to&#xD;
      pharmacological and psychotherapeutic approaches in adult populations. Few studies however,&#xD;
      have investigated to what extent these findings extend to TAY. Further, there is little&#xD;
      consensus as to which intensity level, or &quot;dose&quot;, of AE offers the most benefit, which neural&#xD;
      features underlie the putative benefits of AE in depressed TAY, and the impact on both&#xD;
      psychosocial and cognitive processes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives: The primary objectives of this study are: 1) to determine the effects of moderate&#xD;
      vs. high intensity AE on clinically-rated and subjective symptoms of MDD in TAY; and 2) to&#xD;
      examine the psychosocial, cognitive, and neuromodulatory effects of these interventions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: This two-arm, randomized trial will recruit 40 TAY (16-24 yrs) with MDD/persistent&#xD;
      depressive disorder (PDD) into one of two AE intensity groups: medium or high. Intensity is&#xD;
      defined as a percentage of heart rate reserve (HRR) achieved during exercise, as outlined in&#xD;
      the American College of Sports Medicine (ACSM) guidelines (moderate: 50-55% of HRR; N=20;&#xD;
      high: 80-85% HRR; N=20). All participants will undergo supervised and guided AE intervention&#xD;
      sessions (~30min), three times per week, for twelve consecutive weeks. Pertinent clinical and&#xD;
      psychosocial scores, as well as cardiac function (as assessed by maximal oxygen consumption&#xD;
      [VO2max]), will be recorded pre-intervention (Week 0), mid-intervention (Week 6), and&#xD;
      post-intervention (Week 12). Additionally, participants will undergo electroencephalographic&#xD;
      (EEG) and functional magnetic resonance neuroimaging (fMRI) before and after the completion&#xD;
      of AE intervention. Specifically, neural dynamics will be recorded at rest and during&#xD;
      cognitive tasks engaging working memory (N-Back task) and response inhibition (Flanker task)&#xD;
      - cognitive abilities, which have been shown to be impaired in MDD in TAY. Both&#xD;
      clinical/psychosocial and neuroimaging outcomes will be compared using time as the&#xD;
      within-group, and intervention type as between-group factors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypotheses: The investigators expect a significant reduction in depression symptoms post (vs.&#xD;
      pre) intervention and, based on preliminary evidence in adults, a greater reduction may&#xD;
      emerge in those participating in the high (vs. moderate) intensity AE. Further, the&#xD;
      investigators expect changes in fMRI profiles from pre- to post-intervention (showing&#xD;
      normalization of brain activity and connectivity profiles); the same is true of&#xD;
      EEG/event-related potential (ERP) features. They also expect a positive relation between&#xD;
      VO2max and brain-based changes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Significance: Findings from this project will help guide future large-scale investigations of&#xD;
      AE as a potential treatment for TAY by clarifying the relation between changes to physical&#xD;
      indices, depressive symptoms and neural profiles. Importantly, identifying the brain features&#xD;
      modulated by AE will broaden our understanding of the neurobiological markers underlying&#xD;
      depressive states, allowing for targeted therapeutic approaches and better outcomes for TAY&#xD;
      suffering from MDD.&#xD;
