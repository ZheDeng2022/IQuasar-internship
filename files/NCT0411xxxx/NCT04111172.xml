    <textblock>
      This phase IIA trial investigates the side effects of Ad5.F35-hGCC-PADRE vaccine and to see&#xD;
      how well it works in treating patients with gastrointestinal adenocarcinoma.&#xD;
      Ad5.F35-hGCC-PADRE vaccine may help to train the patient's own immune system to identify and&#xD;
      kill tumor cells and prevent it from coming back.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Evaluate the safety and tolerability of sequential adenovirus 5/F35-human guanylyl cyclase&#xD;
      C-PADRE (Ad5.F35-hGCC-PADRE), delivered intramuscularly three times at three dose levels in&#xD;
      subjects with high-risk colorectal, pancreatic, gastric, or esophageal adenocarcinomas with&#xD;
      no evidence of disease (NED) after surgery and standard therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Evaluate the cellular (T-cell) responses to Ad5.F35-hGCC-PADRE at three different dose&#xD;
      levels (10^11, 10^12, and 5 x 10^12 vp) administered intramuscularly three times, four weeks&#xD;
      apart in subjects with high-risk colorectal, pancreatic, gastric, or esophageal cancer with&#xD;
      NED after surgery and standard therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Evaluate the humoral immunologic response to guanylyl cyclase C (GCC), defined as an&#xD;
      incremental or sustained antibody (pan-Ig) response, measured at weeks 5, 9, and 13 following&#xD;
      the first vaccination (week 1).&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Evaluate the relationship between immunological responses to GCC and 1) neutralizing&#xD;
      antibodies to Ad5 and Ad5.F35 and 2) GCC protein expression in tumors to assess immune&#xD;
      tolerance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. Evaluate disease free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS), where feasible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 3 arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM A: Patients receive low dose Ad5.F35-hGCC-PADRE vaccine intramuscularly (IM) on day 1 of&#xD;
      weeks 1, 5, and 9 in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM B: Patients receive medium dose Ad5.F35-hGCC-PADRE vaccine IM on day 1 of weeks 1, 5, and&#xD;
      9 in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM C: Patients receive high dose Ad5.F35-hGCC-PADRE vaccine IM on day 1 of weeks 1, 5, and 9&#xD;
      in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 28 days, and then every 3&#xD;
      months for at least 24 months.&#xD;

Injection-site reactions including, but not necessarily limited to, local skin erythema, induration, pain and tenderness at administration site.

    <measure>Antigen-specific T-cell response to guanylyl cyclase C (GCC)</measure>
    <time_frame>13 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Will be measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent spot (ELISpot) assay. the immune parameters will be summarized via percentages of responders and mean/median values, along with corresponding 95% confidence intervals, by treatment arm and measurement time. Antibody and T-cell data will be summarized by positive response rates (each subject recorded as yes/no) and exact 2-sided 95% confidence intervals. For this study, a statistically significant increase in GCC-specific T-cell response at Weeks 5, 9, or 13 compared with baseline will be considered a response at that time. Significance of the change from baseline will be assessed using the modified distribution-free resampling (DFR) method. Will estimate response rates across disease types.</description>
