  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study objective is to demonstrate the clinical performance of ShearWave Elastography&#xD;
      (SWE) in Endoscopic Ultrasound (EUS) when compared to FibroScan for evaluation of liver&#xD;
      fibrosis.&#xD;

      This study has been designed as prospective, single center, single arm, consecutive, blinded,&#xD;
      pilot study conducted in a post-market setting using commercially available devices to&#xD;
      evaluate the effectiveness of Endoscopic Ultrasound with ShearWave Elastography to estimate&#xD;
      hepatic fibrosis in patients with chronic liver disease. It is anticipated that the data from&#xD;
      this study will support the need for additional clinical trials. All consenting, eligible&#xD;
      patients reporting for an ultrasound and/or liver biopsy for evaluation of fibrosis meeting&#xD;
      the inclusion criteria will be consecutively enrolled into the study and assigned a unique&#xD;
      study identification number. A total of 52 subjects will be enrolled and treated at a single&#xD;
      study site in the US. Enrollment is expected to be completed within 6 months. Each subject&#xD;
      will undergo both procedures (FibroScan and EUS with SW Elastography), End of study will be&#xD;
      reached after pathology results have been obtained (within a week of the initial procedure).&#xD;
