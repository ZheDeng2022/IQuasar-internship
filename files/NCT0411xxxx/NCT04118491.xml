  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      in some patients, a few days or weeks after they recover from carbon monoxide poisoning they&#xD;
      develop new symptoms. These can affect mood, ability to think or remember clearly, and&#xD;
      movements. Some people develop movement problems that are similar to Parkinson's disease.&#xD;
      This damage to brain tissue is called &quot;encephalopathy,&quot; and this study will look at the&#xD;
      effect of pressurized oxygen therapy on long term, or chronic, encephalopathy.&#xD;

      1. Project title Hyperbaric Oxygen for Carbon Monoxide induced Chronic Encephalopathy&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Principle investigator(s) Jeffrey Cooper, MD Diego Torres-Russo, MD&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Participating institution(s) UNMC, Departments of Emergency Medicine and Neurology&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Study aims, hypotheses, methods (brief overview of design, sample, measures, budget and&#xD;
           statistical analysis plan)&#xD;
&#xD;
           a. Design i. prospective, blinded sham controlled crossover study. ii. N=10 iii. We will&#xD;
           divide the subjects into two groups of five. One group will receive 40 Hyperbaric Oxygen&#xD;
           (HBO2) treatments (100% oxygen at twice normal air pressure (2 ATA)) followed by 40 sham&#xD;
           HBO2 treatments (air at near normal pressure (1.2 ATA)). Treatments will be done once&#xD;
           daily for 2 hours, Monday through Friday. The second block will be treated similarly&#xD;
           except that they will receive sham treatments in the first block and oxygen treatments&#xD;
           in the second block.&#xD;
&#xD;
           iv. Neurological and psychologic assessments will be done prior to starting treatments,&#xD;
           after the first block of 40 and again after the second block of 40.&#xD;
&#xD;
           b. Sample i. Ages: 10-90 ii. CO induced neurological or cognitive sequelae assessed as&#xD;
           at least mild (e.g. UPDRS part 3 (motor)&gt;15).&#xD;
&#xD;
      2. chronicity- signs or symptoms present for greater than one year after exposure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      iii. Exclusions:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. other morbidities which may contribute to chronic neurocognitive deficits such as&#xD;
           traumatic brain injury, poisoning by other toxins, other neurodegenerative diseases&#xD;
           (e.g. Parkinson's disease)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Pregnancy&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. routine contraindications to hyperbaric oxygen (refer to NM policy HM04) c. Measures i.&#xD;
           Primary Outcome: Sf36&#xD;
&#xD;
      1. The Short Form (36) Health Survey is a 36-item, patient-reported survey of patient health&#xD;
      ii. Secondary Outcomes&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Updrs part 3 (motor function)&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. BARS- Brief Ataxia Rating Scale&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. FMDRS a. Fahn-Marsden Dystonia Rating Scale&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Physician assessment&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Moca a. The Montreal Cognitive Assessment- a brief cognitive screening tool for Mild&#xD;
           Cognitive Impairment d. Budget i. Nebraska Medicine has not yet given us a cost per&#xD;
           treatment rate but we estimate $300 each yielding:10 patients @ 80 treatments @&#xD;
           $300=$240,000 e. Statistics i. We will analyze this using standard linear crossover&#xD;
           model techniques on the primary outcome (SF36) as well as the secondary rating scales&#xD;
           (UPDRS, BARS, MOCA, FMDRS) ii. N=10 will be enough to establish mean responses and&#xD;
           standard deviations in order to establish effect sizes to power a future study and to&#xD;
           demonstrate the promise of HBO2 rather than establish statistical significance&#xD;
&#xD;
      5. One-year deliverables&#xD;
&#xD;
      a. Study approved by IRB b. patient recruitment almost done c. several subjects completed d.&#xD;
      We anticipate data collection and study completed by the end of year two.&#xD;
&#xD;
      6. How the project advances clinical and translational research&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Basic science research has established that hyperbaric medicine has a number of&#xD;
           potentially useful effects in healing the injured brain including stem cell migration,&#xD;
           fibroblast proliferation, angiogenesis and neurogenesis in areas of infarct. Case&#xD;
           reports and some small, poorly controlled clinical trials have shown favorable results&#xD;
           in traumatic brain injury, CO induced encephalopathy, and stroke as well as in chronic&#xD;
           issues such as cerebral palsy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. This project looks specifically at CO induced chronic brain injury in a blinded and&#xD;
           controlled fashion as a next step in providing an efficacious treatment option for an&#xD;
           otherwise untreatable condition. If positive results, a larger study would be needed to&#xD;
           confirm its findings.&#xD;
&#xD;
           7. Lay summary of project, including disease/health relevance Carbon monoxide (CO)&#xD;
           poisoning is a leading cause of unintentional poisoning deaths in the United States.&#xD;
           After a period of apparent recovery, survivors of acute CO-poisoning can develop a&#xD;
           potentially permanent neurologic deterioration (DNS). DNS is a rare, poorly known&#xD;
           encephalopathy with a 25-50% prevalence among severely poisoned CO-poisoned patients.&#xD;
           Its symptoms and signs range from subtle abnormalities to severe dementia, Parkinsonism,&#xD;
           gait disturbances, mutism, and incontinence. Recovery from delayed neuropsychiatric&#xD;
           syndrome occurs in 50-75% of patients within 1 year. However, this leaves 25-50%&#xD;
           permanently impaired. Hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBO2) is useful after acute poisoning&#xD;
           to reduce the chance of developing DNS. However, appropriate therapy for DNS is widely&#xD;
           debated; particularly, the role of hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBO2) after DNS has&#xD;
           developed is controversial.&#xD;
&#xD;
           There are research efforts looking into HBO2 for other forms of brain injury such as&#xD;
           trauma, stroke, cerebral palsy and other chronic neurological disorders. We have&#xD;
           reported on a patient treated with remarkable success who was gravely disabled 14 months&#xD;
           from his CO poisoning. A few other similar reports exist in the medical literature. We,&#xD;
           therefore, propose to ascertain whether hyperbaric oxygen is efficacious in the&#xD;
           treatment of chronic DNS brain injury from carbon monoxide (CO) poisoning.&#xD;
&#xD;
           As a pilot study, we intend to recruit, as subjects, ten patients suffering from DNS for&#xD;
           longer than one year. This will be a prospective, blinded sham controlled crossover&#xD;
           study. We will divide the subjects into two groups of five. One group will receive 40&#xD;
           HBO2 treatments (100% oxygen at twice normal air pressure (2 ATA)) followed by 40 sham&#xD;
           HBO2 treatments (air at near normal pressure (1.2 ATA)). Treatments will be done once&#xD;
           daily for 2 hours, Monday through Friday. Neurological and psychologic assessments will&#xD;
           be done prior to starting treatments, after the first block of 40 and again after the&#xD;
           second block of 40. The second block will be treated similarly except that they will&#xD;
           receive sham treatments in the first block and oxygen treatments in the second block. In&#xD;
           this manner, all patients will receive treatment which we believe is therapeutic. All&#xD;
           patients will act as both experimental and control subject.&#xD;
