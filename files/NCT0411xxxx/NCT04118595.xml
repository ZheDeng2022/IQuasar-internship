  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators have developed a three component intervention to support shared&#xD;
      decision-making during the early recovery phase for older adults who present to the emergency&#xD;
      department (ED) or orthopedic urgent care with acute musculoskeletal pain. The first&#xD;
      component is a brief interactive video to enhance patient knowledge and self-efficacy&#xD;
      regarding treatment options with the intent of facilitating conversations between patients&#xD;
      and emergency providers. The second component is a protocol-guided phone conversation&#xD;
      (telecare) between a nurse care manager and the patient at 48-72 hours following discharge to&#xD;
      assess pain severity and interference with daily activities, review analgesic use and side&#xD;
      effects and recovery-promoting behaviors, and discuss adjustments to the patients treatment.&#xD;
      The third component is communication with the patient's primary care provider following the&#xD;
      telecare call to inform them of the patient's condition and treatment plan and encourage&#xD;
      primary care followup. The short-term objective of this project is to test the efficacy of&#xD;
      this intervention to reduce the transition from acute to chronic musculoskeletal pain among&#xD;
      older adults and obtain data to inform implementation. The investigators will conduct a&#xD;
      three-arm randomized controlled trial with adults aged 50 years and older who present to the&#xD;
      ED or orthopedic urgent care with acute musculoskeletal pain. Patients will be randomized to&#xD;
      (1) the full intervention (video + telecare + communication with primary provider), (2) video&#xD;
      alone, or (3) usual care. The primary outcome will be pain, measured longitudinally over the&#xD;
      course of the year following the acute care visit. Secondary outcomes will include physical&#xD;
      function, analgesic side effects and adverse events, opioid use, depression and anxiety&#xD;
      symptoms, sleep duration and quality, and healthcare utilization at one, three, six, and&#xD;
      twelve months. Secondary analyses will (1) examine whether the intervention has its effect by&#xD;
      promoting shared decision-making, and (2) estimate the cost-effectiveness of the&#xD;
      intervention. The long-term goal of this work is to develop, test, and implement&#xD;
      interventions that improve long-term health outcomes for older adults with acute&#xD;
      musculoskeletal pain.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients will be assigned to one of the three treatment arms using 1:1:1 randomization,&#xD;
      stratified by access to a primary care provider, using randomly permuted blocks with random&#xD;
      block sizes. (Primary care access will be determined using Source of Care questions from the&#xD;
      Primary Care Assessment tool.) Randomization will be based on computer generated lists and&#xD;
      allocated within subgroups based on access to a PCP using REDCap's integrated randomization&#xD;
      module. One arm will receive the full intervention (educational video, telecare call,&#xD;
      transmission of clinical information to the PCP), one will view the educational video only,&#xD;
      and one will receive usual care. The investigators decided against a 2x2 factorial design,&#xD;
      which would add a telecare only arm, because our team' s collective understanding is that a&#xD;
      basic understanding of pain management (as provided by the educational video) is essential&#xD;
      for effective SDM (shared decision-making) and often missing among older patients. Screening,&#xD;
      consent, randomization, and assessments will be completed by the study coordinator.&#xD;
      Interventions&#xD;
&#xD;
      Educational Video:Development of the original video was funded by the John A. Hartford&#xD;
      Foundation and used a systematic approach that included a review of literature and current&#xD;
      pain management guidelines and input from emergency physicians, geriatricians, and experts in&#xD;
      pharmacology, physical therapy, and risk communication. The video offers information about&#xD;
      the pharmacologic management of acute musculoskeletal pain (MSP) and recovery-promoting&#xD;
      behaviors. Each video section is followed by a multiple-choice question to promote&#xD;
      interaction and reinforce learning. The actress for the 13-minute video is a 56-year-old&#xD;
      mixed-race woman who presents herself as a healthcare provider. The video script was&#xD;
      developed for a grade level 5.5 and will be shown to the patient within 24 hours of the acute&#xD;
      care visit. A link to the video is emailed or texted to the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Telecare: Telecare will be provided via a protocol-guided phone call from a nurse care&#xD;
      manager 48-72 hours after discharge. The call is designed to support patient decision-making&#xD;
      regarding analgesics and behaviors following the content presented in the video. Before the&#xD;
      call, the nurse will review the note from the index visit to obtain information about&#xD;
      comorbidities,medications, allergies, and the patient's evaluation and treatment in the ED.&#xD;
      Topics covered in the call will include discussion of pain management goals and priorities,&#xD;
      current analgesic use, non-pharmacologic methods of pain management, warnings about potential&#xD;
      side effects, and open-ended questions to address additional patient care needs.&#xD;
      Conversations will be guided by an SDM framework in which the nurse elicits information from&#xD;
      the patient, then discusses with the patient alternative strategies, and actively elicits&#xD;
      feedback from the patient. Patients will be encouraged to follow-up with their PCP; uninsured&#xD;
      patients will be referred to local free or low-cost medical clinics. The telecare call is&#xD;
      designed to last 15 minutes and the nurse will be trained to complete the call in 15 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Correspondence with PCP: Following the telecare conversation, the nurse will enter a note in&#xD;
      the EHR (Electronic Health Record) documenting the patient's current clinical status,&#xD;
      information reviewed, and any recommendations or referrals made. The nurse will then share&#xD;
      this note directly with the patient's PCP using a secure e-mail or an electronic message&#xD;
      within the EHR if the PCP is a University of North Carolina (UNC)-affiliated provider. (If&#xD;
      the PCP's email address is not available, the research staff will contact the PCP or their&#xD;
      office by phone to obtain an email address or fax number.) This communication with also&#xD;
      include: (1) The date, time, location and reason for the initial visit; (2) Results of&#xD;
      diagnostics studies; (3) Discharge prescriptions/recommendations; (4) A summary of and link&#xD;
      to the video, explaining the emphasis on patient knowledge and SDM; (5) summary of the&#xD;
      telecare conversation; and (6) encouragement for follow-up. PCPs will be asked to confirm&#xD;
      receipt of this message.&#xD;

    <measure>Longitudinal Combined Pain Severity and Interference Scores from Month 1 to Month 6</measure>
    <time_frame>Month 1 (following ED or orthopedic urgent care visit) to Month 6</time_frame>
    <description>The BPI-SF is an 11-item measure of pain severity and pain interference. Patients will rate their pain severity and interference over the past week on a 0-10 numeric scale at 3 discrete time periods (1, 3, and 6 months). End points for the severity items include 0 which equals &quot;no pain&quot; and 10 which equals &quot;pain as bad as you can imagine.&quot; End points for the interference items include 0 which equals &quot;does not interfere&quot; and 10 &quot;completely interferes.&quot; Higher scores reflect more pain severity and more pain interference. A composite score will be calculated by averaging scores from both the pain severity and interference items (all 11-items). Results from the 3 time periods will be analyzed longitudinally.</description>

    <measure>Side Effect Frequency and Severity Composite Score at Discrete Time Points: 1 week and 1 month</measure>
    <time_frame>1 week &amp; 1 month</time_frame>
    <description>The Opioid-Related Symptom Distress Scale (OR-SDS) will be used to assess subject-reported levels of frequency and severity concerning 10 symptoms known to be associated with opioid medication usage, such as drowsiness, dizziness, and constipation. Added to this measure are 5 other symptoms (including shortness of breath, falls, abdominal pain, bloody stool, and 'other'), reflecting side effects for patients taking NSAIDs or acetaminophen. Symptom frequency will be rated as: 1=rarely, 2=occasionally, 3=frequently, or 4=almost constantly, with higher ratings indicating more frequent symptoms. Symptom severity will be rated as: 1=slightly, 2-moderate, 3=severe, or 4=very severe, with higher ratings indicating more severe symptoms. Patients who deny a symptom will be given a score of zero for frequency and severity. A mean symptom distress score will be calculated for each arm based on patient reported scores for frequency and severity.</description>
