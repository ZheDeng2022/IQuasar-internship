    <textblock>
      Pemphigus is a rare autoimmune disease involving skin and mucous membranes characterized by&#xD;
      the production of pathogenic autoantibodies directed against desmosomal transmembrane&#xD;
      glycoproteins belonging to the cadherin family,responsible for the disruption of desmosomes&#xD;
      leading to the acantholysis phenomenon.Two main classical subtypes of pemphigus have been&#xD;
      individualized:pemphigus vulgaris and foliaceus,in which pathogenic autoantibodies are&#xD;
      directed against desmoglein 3 and 1 respectively.The knowledge about B-cell populations&#xD;
      responsible for pemphigus activity increased a lot.In pemphigus patients,B-cell population&#xD;
      was shown to comprise auto-reactive B lymphocytes producing antibodies targeting&#xD;
      desmogleins,directly responsible for disease activity,and regulatory B lymphocytes.After&#xD;
      rituximab treatment,clinical activity was proved to be associated with circulating&#xD;
      auto-antibodies high titers and an increase of auto-reactive B-cells,whereas clinical&#xD;
      remission was associated with a change in B-cell populations,as B cell repertoire changed&#xD;
      from oligoclonal to polyclonal when reconstituting after treatment,with an increase of&#xD;
      immatures and transitional B-cells producing IL-10.The mechanisms leading to autoreactive&#xD;
      B-cells appearance,the precise role of B-reg in immune tolerance and the factors triggering&#xD;
      the imbalance between pro autoimmune and regulatory immune B-cells leading to pemphigus&#xD;
      activity remain to be discovered.Polymorphonuclear neutrophil granulocytes(PMN) are the first&#xD;
      responders of the immune system to threats by invading microorganisms.Since 2004, PMN were&#xD;
      shown to produce neutrophil extracellular traps(NET),structures consisting of decondensed&#xD;
      chromatin embedded with histones,granular and cytoplasmic proteins that trap and kill&#xD;
      microbes.In lupus recent works demonstrated evidences that NETs components are found in&#xD;
      immune complexes responsible for tissue inflammation and that polyclonal activation of B-cell&#xD;
      as well as memory B-cell activation could be obtain in presence of immune complexes derived&#xD;
      from NET.Besides lupus,other works showed evidence of NETs implication in inflammatory and&#xD;
      auto-immune states in rheumatoid arthritis and small vessel vasculitis.The hypotheses is that&#xD;
      B-cell activation by NET might not be restricted to autoimmune diseases of which antibodies&#xD;
      target NETs components.The aim is to assess the effects on B-cell activation and the&#xD;
      phenotypic changes in B-cell population from pemphigus patients after stimulation by NET.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Pemphigus is a rare autoimmune disease involving skin and mucous membranes with an incidence&#xD;
      estimated as 0.7 to 7 new cases per million per year, responsible for non-negligible&#xD;
      morbidity and mortality. Pemphigus is characterized by the production of pathogenic&#xD;
      autoantibodies directed against two desmosomal proteins involved in keratinocyte adhesion&#xD;
      (i.e. desmoglein 1 and desmoglein 3). These antibodies are responsible for the disruption of&#xD;
      desmosomes leading to the acantholysis phenomenon, which results in the formation of skin and&#xD;
      mucosal blisters. Two main classical subtypes of pemphigus have been individualized,&#xD;
      pemphigus vulgaris (PV) and pemphigus foliaceus (PF), in which pathogenic autoantibodies are&#xD;
      directed against desmosomal transmembrane glycoproteins belonging to the cadherin family,&#xD;
      desmoglein 3, and desmoglein 1, respectively. As for many auto-immune diseases, high doses of&#xD;
      corticosteroids (CS) remained the mainstay of first-line treatment for long time, alone or in&#xD;
      conjunction with immunosuppressants. However, on these regimens, frequent relapses occurs&#xD;
      when tapering CS dosage leading to long-term treatment and its associated risk of CS side&#xD;
      effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since ten years, the improvement in the knowledge of B-cell activation and survival, as well&#xD;
      as their direct implication in auto-immune disease such as pemphigus through pathogenic&#xD;
      auto-antibodies production, led to the identification of new therapeutic targets. New&#xD;
      biological therapies based on B cell depletion were developed in severe autoimmune disorders,&#xD;
      notably in pemphigus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several teams demonstrated the safety and efficacy of Rituximab, a chimeric immunoglobulin&#xD;
      gamma-1(IgG1) monoclonal antibody(mAb) targeting the cluster of differentiation antigen&#xD;
      20(CD20) molecule expressed by normal B-cells from pre-B cells except for plasma cells, in&#xD;
      severe pemphigus refractory to corticosteroids as well as in first line of treatment. Across&#xD;
      these works, some of them concurred to improve the knowledge about B-cell populations&#xD;
      responsible for pemphigus activity. In pemphigus patients, B-cell population was shown to&#xD;
      comprise auto-reactive B lymphocytes producing antibodies targeting desmogleins, directly&#xD;
      responsible for disease activity, and regulatory B lymphocytes (B-reg). After rituximab&#xD;
      treatment of pemphigus patients, clinical activity was proved to be associated with&#xD;
      circulating auto-antibodies high titers and an increase of auto-reactive B-cells, whereas&#xD;
      clinical remission was associated with a change in B-cell populations, as B cell repertoire&#xD;
      changed from oligoclonal to polyclonal when reconstituting after treatment, with an increase&#xD;
      of immatures and transitional B-cells producing IL-10 (B-reg).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The mechanisms leading to autoreactive B-cells appearance, the precise role of B-reg in&#xD;
      immune tolerance, and the factors triggering the imbalance between pro autoimmune and&#xD;
      regulatory immune B-cells leading to pemphigus activity remain to be discovered. As for other&#xD;
      auto-immune diseases, first flares and relapses were described following infectious events.&#xD;
      Thus, infectious agents might trigger unknown mechanisms participating in the immune system&#xD;
      imbalance by the activation of previously quiescent auto reactive B-cells or effector&#xD;
      B-cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Polymorphonuclear neutrophil granulocytes (PMN) are the first responders of the immune system&#xD;
      to threats by invading microorganisms; performing essential functions of innate immunity in&#xD;
      host defence against a broad range of pathogens, notably by phagocytosis, intracellular&#xD;
      degradation and extracellular discharge of antimicrobial factors. Since 2004, Polynuclear&#xD;
      Neutral Neutrophil (PNN) were shown to produce neutrophil extracellular traps (NET),&#xD;
      structures consisting of decondensed chromatin embedded with histones, granular and&#xD;
      cytoplasmic proteins that trap and kill microbes. NET were initially consider to arise&#xD;
      following cell death (NETosis) but NET formation was also described without PMN death with&#xD;
      mitochondrial DNA extrusion. NET production during infectious events is responsible for the&#xD;
      release of cytosolic, nuclear and mitochondrial antigens in the extracellular environment;&#xD;
      this auto-antigen exposure constituting favourable conditions for autoimmune disease such as&#xD;
      lupus erythematosus and AntiNeutrophil Cytoplasmic Antibody (ANCA) vasculitis, of which&#xD;
      auto-antibodies targets belong to NET components (DNA, RNA, MPO, PR3). Besides antimicrobial&#xD;
      function, an excessive production of NET or NET insufficient clearance were found to maintain&#xD;
      tissue inflammation and excessive tissue damages that contribute to autoinflammatory and&#xD;
      autoimmune diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In lupus, recent works demonstrated evidences that NET components are found in immune&#xD;
      complexes responsible for tissue inflammation and that polyclonal activation of B-cell as&#xD;
      well as memory B-cell activation could be obtain in presence of immune complexes derived from&#xD;
      NET.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Besides lupus, other works showed evidence of NET implication in inflammatory and auto-immune&#xD;
      states in rheumatoid arthritis and small vessel vasculitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that B-cell activation by NET might not be restricted to&#xD;
      autoimmune diseases of which antibodies target NET components, as it is the case for lupus&#xD;
      (DNA, RNA, LL37), Rheumatoid Arthritis(RA) (citrullinated proteins) or small vessel&#xD;
      vasculitis (PR3, MPO).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus, the primary aim is to assess the effects on B-cell activation and the phenotypic&#xD;
      changes in B-cell population from pemphigus patients after stimulation by neutrophil&#xD;
      extracellular traps.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary aim is to compare the results obtained in pemphigus patients to patients with&#xD;
      other autoimmune diseases such as lupus, rheumatoid arthritis a Gougerot-Sjögren syndrome.&#xD;
