  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      According to the World Health Organization (WHO), headaches are one of the most common&#xD;
      nervous system disorders. The therapeutic strategy is well established for certain&#xD;
      subcategories of headache. On the other hand, when headaches become refractory, some nerves&#xD;
      may become the target of targeted therapies. This is the case of the Arnold nerve, also&#xD;
      called the great occipital nerve, which is involved in certain pathologies, both&#xD;
      physiopathologically and therapeutically. The Arnold nerve infiltration has a relatively&#xD;
      short duration of effectiveness (about 1 month on average), some teams have reported the&#xD;
      interest of achieving a destruction of the Arnold nerve by radio frequency, with extended&#xD;
      durations of efficiencies to several months. The use of cryoneurolysis has been known for a&#xD;
      long time and its effectiveness in the management of cranio-facial pain is already reported.&#xD;
      It is thus possible to obtain, at the end of the cryoanalgesia needle, very low temperatures&#xD;
      around -40 Â° C, which leads to the formation of an ice cube and, where appropriate, the&#xD;
      freezing of the structures (nerves among others) to the needle contacts. This induces the&#xD;
      formation of microcrystals leading to irreversible lesions of vasa-nervorums resulting in an&#xD;
      endoneural edema. In the long run, it appears a Wallerian degeneration without destruction of&#xD;
      this endoneurum. This is associated with the lack of destruction of the structure of the&#xD;
      Schwann cell. Nerve regeneration is possible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The diffusion MRI study allows tractographic reconstruction of the nerves. This is the only&#xD;
      imaging technique that focuses on the fibrillar structure of the nerves, thus enabling the&#xD;
      detection of nerves throughout its path. It is a morphological imaging technique nevertheless&#xD;
      it also allows a quantitative analysis of the nerve through certain parameters.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Investigators hypothesize that the cryoneurolysis of the Arnold nerve will result in the&#xD;
      disappearance of visualization of the nerve by MRI tractography. The effect of cryoneurolysis&#xD;
      on Arnold nerves, as on other peripheral nerves through diffusion MRI has never been&#xD;
      described. The follow-up of MRI patients who had undergone cryoneurolysis would make it&#xD;
      possible to study the behavior of these nerves after cryoneurolysis, and to correlate the&#xD;
      aspect in tractography with the clinical data. Painful recurrence can then be correlated with&#xD;
      visualization of the nerves by MRI.&#xD;
