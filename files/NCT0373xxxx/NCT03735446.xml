    <textblock>
      This research study is studying a targeted therapy combined with chemotherapy as a possible&#xD;
      treatment for acute myeloid leukemia (AML) or high risk myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The drugs involved in this study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Prexasertib (LY2606368)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Mitoxantrone&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Etoposide&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cytarabine&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This research study is a Phase I clinical trial, which tests the safety of an investigational&#xD;
      drug or combination of drugs and also tries to define the appropriate dose of the&#xD;
      investigational intervention to use for further studies. &quot;Investigational&quot; means that the&#xD;
      drug is being studied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has not approved prexasertib as a treatment&#xD;
      for any disease. Prexasertib is a checkpoint kinase 1 (CHK1) inhibitor that is being&#xD;
      developed as a treatment for patients with advanced cancer. CHK1 inhibitors work by&#xD;
      preventing cancer cells from being able to repair damaged DNA (one of the building blocks of&#xD;
      a cell) which then leads to cell death.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The drugs mitoxantrone, etoposide, and cytarabine (MEC) have all been approved by the FDA.&#xD;
      MEC is a standard chemotherapy treatment option, commonly used for AML that has not responded&#xD;
      to other standard treatment or returned following standard treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this research study, the investigators are combining prexasertib with MEC therapy to test&#xD;
      if it is a safe treatment for AML or MDS that has returned or not responded to standard&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;

             considered a second regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  For relapsed AML: relapse as defined by IWG criteria. Relapsed patients must be first&#xD;
             or second relapse (hydroxyurea is not considered a prior treatment regimen).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  For patients with MDS, ≥ 10% myeloblasts in the bone marrow, and no more than 2 prior&#xD;
             treatment regimens (hydroxyurea is not considered a prior treatment regimen).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must be medically eligible to receive mitoxantrone, etoposide, and cytarabine&#xD;
             (MEC) therapy.&#xD;

             or suspect she is pregnant while she or her partner is participating in this study,&#xD;
             she should inform her treating physician immediately. Men treated or enrolled on this&#xD;
             protocol must also agree to use adequate contraception prior to the study, for the&#xD;
             duration of study participation, and 4 months after completion of study therapy&#xD;
             administration. A negative serum pregnancy test is required for women of child-bearing&#xD;

        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have had chemotherapy, other investigational therapy, radiotherapy, or&#xD;
             immune therapy within 2 weeks prior to the first dose of study medication. Hydroxyurea&#xD;

&#xD;
               -  Malignancies that have been curatively treated and have not recurred within the&#xD;
                  past 2 years&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Adequately treated carcinoma in situ of any type&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Curatively treated non-melanoma skin cancers&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Any other malignancy that has been curatively treated with a low likelihood of&#xD;
                  recurrence as judged by the treating investigator and agreed upon with the&#xD;
                  overall principal investigator prior to study entry&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Patients with other secondary malignancies may be allowed to enroll with&#xD;
                  agreement from the overall principal investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to: uncontrolled active&#xD;
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris,&#xD;
             uncontrolled cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would&#xD;
             limit compliance with study requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because prexasertib, mitoxantrone,&#xD;
             etoposide, and cytarabine are anti-cancer agents with the potential for teratogenic or&#xD;
             abortifacient effects. Because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse&#xD;
             events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with the study agents,&#xD;
             breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated with prexasertib,&#xD;
             mitoxantrone, etoposide, or cytarabine.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who are known to be seropositive for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or&#xD;
             hepatitis B or C.&#xD;
