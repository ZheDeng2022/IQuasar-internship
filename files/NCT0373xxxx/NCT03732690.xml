      Context and justification:&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is growing evidence that the gut microbiota is a key element in the pathophysiology of&#xD;
      cardio-metabolic diseases (CMD) such as Type 2 Diabetes (T2D). One hypothesis is that&#xD;
      gut-derived metabolites (from diet) have an important role in the host metabolism.&#xD;
      Preliminary results show that imidazole propionate (ImP), a degradation product of the&#xD;
      essential amino acid histidine, is produced by the gut microbiota of T2D patients, but not&#xD;
      healthy subjects. The gut microbiota itself is strongly influenced by diet and ethnicity.&#xD;
      However, most dietary intervention studies have focused on the role of fiber intake and the&#xD;
      effect of dietary protein on the gut microbiota composition and metabolite production is not&#xD;
      well known. Our hypothesis is that, depending on the baseline gut microbiome composition, a&#xD;
      diminution in protein intake could decrease the microbial production of metabolites such as&#xD;
      ImP and improve the metabolism of the host. We also hypothesize that the effects of such an&#xD;
      intervention could depend the ethnic background.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To study the effects of a high protein (HP) vs a low protein (LP) diet on gut microbiota&#xD;
      composition and production of pro-diabetic metabolites in type 2 diabetes (T2D) patients from&#xD;
      Caucasian and Caribbean ethnicity depending on baseline metagenomics richness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomized controlled three months dietary intervention study&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population:&#xD;
&#xD;
      T2D patients from Caucasian (N=80) and Caribbean (N=40) background who are on a stable dose&#xD;
      of metformin and do not use insulin or proton-pump inhibitors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be randomized to either a high protein (HP) or low protein (LP) diet for three&#xD;
      months. Individuals of Caucasian ethnicity, will also be stratified according to either a&#xD;
      high or low gut microbiota gene richness. All subjects will receive pre-cooked meals 6 days&#xD;
      per week and daily food packages. Subjects are required to keep food diaries three days a&#xD;
      week and will also have weekly contact with an Pitié-Salpêtrière dietician.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome measures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary endpoint is the change in glycemic excursion (area under the curve) after a mixed&#xD;
      meal test between baseline and 12 weeks after the beginning of the intervention. Furthermore,&#xD;
      we will study oral and fecal microbiota composition changes as well as serum levels of&#xD;
      intestinal metabolites, such as ImP, body weight and body composition at baseline and after&#xD;
      12 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample Size:&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is calculated that a total of 20 patients per arm are needed so 120 patients in total.&#xD;

      Context and justification:&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is growing evidence that the gut microbiota is a key element in the pathophysiology of&#xD;

      gut-derived metabolites (from diet) have an important role in the host metabolism.&#xD;

      However, most dietary intervention studies have focused on the role of fiber intake and the&#xD;
      effect of dietary protein on the gut microbiota composition and metabolite production is not&#xD;
      well known. Moreover, it has been shown that the response to a dietary intervention may&#xD;
      depend on the baseline gut microbiome richness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main hypothesis: Depending on the baseline gut microbiome composition, a diminution in&#xD;
      protein intake could decrease the microbial production of metabolites such as ImP and improve&#xD;
      the metabolism of the host. We also hypothesize that the effects of such an intervention&#xD;
      could depend the ethnic background.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Individuals with type 2 diabetes (T2D), of Caucasian or Caribbean origin, 120 patients will&#xD;
      be included in total&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assignment after randomization to one of the following 2 diets:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  HP diet: high protein (High Protein, HP) diet with 30% protein, 40% carbohydrate and 30%&#xD;
           fat (as% of total energy intake)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  LP diet: low protein diet (Low Protein, LP) with 10% protein, 55% carbohydrate and 35%&#xD;
           fat (as% of total energy intake) Food boxes adapted to each diet (HP or LP pre-cooked&#xD;
           meals, HP or LP breads and snacks) will be provided to the participants throughout the&#xD;
           study reaching 40-50% of their prescribed daily energy intake for 6 days per week.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects are required to keep food diaries three days a week and will also have weekly&#xD;
      contact with a dietician.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visits:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Inclusion visit V0 (maximum 1 month before V1): Participants will first be recruited from&#xD;
      the diabetic population of the French cohort of the European project METACARDIS. Individuals&#xD;
      eligible for the study are screened for inclusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline phenotyping is performed (metabolic, inflammatory blood markers, stool and oral&#xD;
      microbiota sampling, body composition by DXA, questionnaires)&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Randomization visit V1 (T0 - start of the intervention): Randomization into 2 parallel&#xD;
      groups (High Protein or Low protein diet) will be stratified based on metagenomics richness&#xD;
      (obtained from Metacardis results), age (&lt; or ≥ 60), gender, ethnic background (Caribbean or&#xD;
      Caucasian).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Meal tolerance test, anthropometric measures, resting energy expenditure measure, one week&#xD;
      CGMS, 24h urinary urea measure are performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Follow-up visit V2 (T42 +/- 7 days): Mid protocol visit with anthropometric measures, one&#xD;
      week CGMS, 24h urinary urea measures, stool sampling.&#xD;
&#xD;
      - End of study visit V3 (T84 +/- 7 days): Phenotyping is performed (metabolic, inflammatory&#xD;
      blood markers, stool and oral microbiota sampling, body composition by DXA, questionnaires,&#xD;
      meal tolerance test, anthropometric measures, resting energy expenditure measure, one week&#xD;
      CGMS, 24h urinary urea measure)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are no multiple hypotheses since our study has only one primary objective (AUC delta of&#xD;
      the glycemic excursion after a mixed meal tolerance test (MMT) between the beginning of study&#xD;
      and 3 months post intervention). Thus, the problem of the type 1 error will not arise.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary endpoint will be analyzed to compare changes in AUC for glycemic excursion versus&#xD;
      diet (rich vs. low protein), based on initial metagenomic richness (high vs. low) and&#xD;
      ethnicity (Caucasian vs. Caribbean). AUC changes after dietary intervention between the&#xD;
      different groups will be tested using linear regression models for repeated measurements with&#xD;
      adjustment for initial levels. The effect of diet composition within the groups will be&#xD;
      tested using Bonferroni's post-hoc covariance analysis (ANCOVA) analyzes. For secondary&#xD;
      endpoints, the same approaches will be used for analysis of postprandial metabolites (AUC,&#xD;
      AUC, post-MMT variation). Differences in relative abundance of bacterial species and&#xD;
      functional modules (generated by metagenomic sequencing) and quality of life questionnaires&#xD;
      will also be analyzed by subgroups using uni / multivariate analyzes. Correlations will be&#xD;
      sought between changes in bio-clinical variables and changes in measurements of different&#xD;
      metabolites.&#xD;
