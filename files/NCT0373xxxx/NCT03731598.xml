  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Overnutrition and physical inactivity promote the accumulation of sphingolipids such as&#xD;
      ceramides which block insulin signaling and anabolic metabolism. Implementation of&#xD;
      pharmacological or genetic interventions to reduce sphingolipid levels in rodents prevents or&#xD;
      reverses an impressive array of metabolic pathologies (e.g. insulin resistance, diabetes,&#xD;
      steatohepatitis, hypertension, cardiomyopathy, and atherosclerosis). To elucidate the&#xD;
      tissue-specific mechanisms through which ceramides contribute to these diseases, mice have&#xD;
      been produced to allow for the conditional, cell-type restricted ablation of enzymes required&#xD;
      for ceramide biosynthesis or degradation (i.e. serine palmitoyltransferase and&#xD;
      dihydroceramide desaturases-1) or degradation (i.e. acid ceramidase). Aims of the project&#xD;
      include the following: To use these novel mouse models to evaluate the effect of&#xD;
      muscle-specific ceramide depletion or induction on insulin sensitivity, muscle growth, and&#xD;
      genomic/proteomic signatures under conditions of overnutrition and inactivity. To apply a&#xD;
      ceramide flux assay in isolated human myotubes to identify the regulatory mechanisms that&#xD;
      influence rates of ceramide biosynthesis; and, To determine the efficacy of a new class of&#xD;
      inhibitors of dihydroceramide desaturases-1, our preferred target in the ceramide synthesis&#xD;
      pathway, as therapeutics that improve muscle insulin sensitivity and prevent muscle loss in&#xD;
      rodents. Findings obtained from these studies could uncover new nutrient-sensing machinery&#xD;
      that modulates insulin sensitivity and muscle growth. Moreover, the translational component&#xD;
      could lead to new pharmacological approaches for improving muscle health.&#xD;

      Healthy, insulin sensitive, physically active male and female adults will be studied (N=15;&#xD;
      65-80 years as determined by sample size calculation below) recruited from the Salt Lake City&#xD;
      area. Inclusion and exclusion criteria can be found in Protection of Human Subjects.&#xD;
      Outpatient blood screening, including an oral glucose tolerance (OGTT) test, and bed rest&#xD;
      experiments will take place in the University Center for Clinical and Translational Sciences&#xD;
      (CCTS), a clinical service supported by an NIH Clinical and Translational Science Award. The&#xD;
      CCTS medical supervising physician oversees procedures. Participants will arrive at the CCTS&#xD;
      fasted on Day 1 and a euglycemic-hyperinsulinemic clamp study will be performed as done&#xD;
      previously with this unit. Vastus lateralis muscle biopsies will be obtained before and three&#xD;
      hours after the clamp. Periodic blood samples will be obtained as part of the clamp procedure&#xD;
      for measurement of insulin and glucose. Muscle samples will be either cultured or&#xD;
      flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored for later analysis. After completion of the first&#xD;
      insulin clamp experiment (Day 1), subjects will adhere to 5-days of strict bed rest as this&#xD;
      is a clinically-relevant time frame for older adults hospitalized for acute medical illness,&#xD;
      as well as being sufficient to induced insulin resistance. Established safety and comfort&#xD;
      guidelines will be followed as done previously. On Day 5, after an overnight fast, a second&#xD;
      insulin clamp study will be conducted and muscle biopsies will be again obtained.&#xD;
