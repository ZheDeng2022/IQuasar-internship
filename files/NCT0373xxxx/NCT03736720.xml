    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well liposomal irinotecan, leucovorin, and fluorouracil work&#xD;
      in treating patients with high grade neuroendocrine cancer of gastrointestinal, unknown, or&#xD;
      pancreatic origin that does not respond to treatment and has spread to other places in the&#xD;
      body. Lliposomal irinotecan may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the&#xD;
      enzymes needed for cell growth. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as fluorouracil and&#xD;
      leucovorin, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the&#xD;
      cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Giving liposomal&#xD;
      irinotecan, leucovorin and fluorouracil may work better in treating patients with&#xD;
      neuroendocrine cancer.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the objective response rate liposomal irinotecan (nanoliposomal irinotecan&#xD;
      [Nal-IRI]) + fluorouracil (5FU) and leucovorin in patients with refractory advanced high&#xD;
      grade neuroendocrine cancer of gastrointestinal (GI), unknown or pancreatic origin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine overall survival, progression-free survival, time to treatment failure,&#xD;
      safety, clinical response and, quality of life (QOL) changes resulting from the combination&#xD;
      treatment of nanoliposomal irinotecan (Nal-IRI) + fluorouracil (5FU) and leucovorin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Genetic profiling for mutations will be conducted on all pre-study tumor samples and&#xD;
      compared to changes in immune response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive liposomal irinotecan intravenously (IV) over 90 minutes, leucovorin IV over&#xD;
      30 minutes, and fluorouracil IV over 46 hours on days 1 and 15. Courses repeat every 28 days&#xD;
      for in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 30 days, then every 2&#xD;
      months thereafter.&#xD;
