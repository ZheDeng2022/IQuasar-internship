  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Breast cancer patients commonly take medications to reduce the risk of recurrence, including&#xD;
      aromatase inhibitors (AIs). AIs can cause significant side effects that reduce patient&#xD;
      adherence. Early discontinuation of AI therapy results in an increased risk of cancer&#xD;
      recurrence and increased risk of breast cancer-related death. Common side effects include&#xD;
      vaginal dryness and vulvovaginal atrophy leading to worsening sexual function. To increase AI&#xD;
      adherence, the investigators will study a non-pharmaceutical Vaginal Renewal Program (VRP)&#xD;
      aimed at stimulating nitric oxide production to consequently increase vaginal lubrication,&#xD;
      and improve the symptoms of vulvovaginal atrophy.&#xD;

    <description>The investigators expect the percentage of superficial vaginal cells to be greater at the post-intervention time point when compared to the pre-intervention time point. If the percentage of superficial vaginal cells is ≥ 4% following the intervention, then the response will be considered positive.</description>

    <measure>Change in Vaginal pH</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Changes in the vaginal pH will be analyzed to determine the extent to which the changes correlate with changes in the primary outcome and with patient reported outcomes. Given the longitudinal nature of the study, linear and generalized linear mixed effects models will be fit to the data gathered. The restricted maximum likelihood (REML) criterion will be used and 95% semi-parametrically bootstrapped confidence intervals will be obtained for all parameters. All statistical analyses will be conducted using R (R Core Team 2014).</description>

    <description>Number of subjects with improved anxiety outcomes per over baseline. The PROMIS (Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System) Emotional Distress - Anxiety scale measures patient perceived changes in anxiety and includes 8 questions that they answer about their emotional state in the past 7 days. Descriptive answers are scored from 1 (never) to 5 (always). The total possible range of scores is from 8-40, with higher scores indicating a worse outcome.</description>
