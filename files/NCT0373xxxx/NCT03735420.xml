  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A pilot study to assess the safety and tolerability of oral xanthohumol in humans, to&#xD;
      identify a biological signature of xanthohumol exposure, and to characterize the role of&#xD;
      xanthohumol metabolism by intestinal microorganisms in that signature.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a double-masked, placebo controlled, randomized clinical trial of xanthohumol, which&#xD;
      is a constituent of hops (Humulus lupulus). Hops and its constituents have a long history of&#xD;
      use for a variety of conditions. However, knowledge is limited regarding the measurable&#xD;
      biological markers of human exposure, and the role of xanthohumol metabolism by&#xD;
      microorganisms present in the gut. This information is necessary for the development of&#xD;
      xanthohumol as a potential therapeutic intervention in conditions such as inflammatory bowel&#xD;
      disease.&#xD;

    <masking_description>Randomization will occur in up to 8 blocks of 4 based on biological sex. Initial randomization series will be generated using readily available random sequence generators designed to do so. A series of sequential envelopes will be generated, each containing the allocation for one participant. Envelopes will be opaque and signed across the seal. The randomization &quot;code&quot; will be kept in a sealed envelope with a signature across the label and dated the day of creation. Study product and comparator (placebo) will be compounded and placed in identical opaque capsules outside the institution.</masking_description>
