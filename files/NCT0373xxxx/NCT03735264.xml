  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Anlotinib is a multi-target receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor in domestic research and&#xD;
      development. It can inhibit the angiogenesis related kinase, such as VEGFR, FGFR, PDGFR, and&#xD;
      tumor cell proliferation related kinase -c-Kit kinase. In the phase Ⅲ study, patients who&#xD;
      failed at least two kinds of systemic chemotherapy (third line or beyond) or drug intolerance&#xD;
      were treated with anlotinib or placebo, the anlotinib group PFS and OS were 5.37 months and&#xD;
      9.63 months, the placebo group PFS and OS were 1.4 months and 6.3 months. Therefore,we&#xD;
      envisage using anlotinib plus docetaxel treat the advanced non-small cell lung cancer after&#xD;
      the failure of Platinum-Based Doublet-Chemotherapy to further improve the patient's PFS or&#xD;
      OS.&#xD;

      This is a multicentre single arm clinical trial conducted in China,the purpose of this study&#xD;
      is To Evaluate the Effectiveness and Safety of Anlotinib (12mg QD PO d1-14, 21 days per&#xD;
      cycle)Combined with Docetaxel (75mg/m2 IV d1) for advanced non-small cell lung cancer after&#xD;
      the failure of Platinum-Based Doublet-Chemotherapy.According to the result of TAX317,the ORR&#xD;
      of second line standard chemotherapy was 5- 8%. We expect the ORR was 20%. Using PASS11, we&#xD;
      calculated the sample size of this study was 41 , according to 10% censoring,the expected&#xD;
      sample size is 46.&#xD;
