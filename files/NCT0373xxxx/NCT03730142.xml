  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      WXFL10030390 (WX390) is a novel oral small molecular that inhibits phosphoinositide-3 kinase&#xD;
      (PI3K) and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) and has demonstrated potent inhibitory&#xD;
      effects on multiple human tumor xenografts. The first-in-human study is conducted to assess&#xD;
      the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and dose-limiting toxicity (DLT), to evaluate the&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics, safety and preliminary anti-tumor activity of WX390 at single dose and&#xD;
      multiple doses.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will be an open-lable, phase Ⅰ study and will evaluate the safety and&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics of WX390 after a single administration followed by a 28-day continuous&#xD;
      course of therapy; evaluate the safety and preliminary efficacy in an open-lable&#xD;
      administration of WX390 at the MTD.&#xD;
