      This study is to validate 1-hour and 3-hours diagnostic strategy using Architect&#xD;
      high-sensitivity cardiac troponin I (hs-cTnI) in Chinese patients with suspected&#xD;
      Non-ST-elevation Myocardial Infarction (NSTEMI). The accuracy of 1-hour and 3-hours algorithm&#xD;
      of NSTEMI using hs-cTnI assays will be evaluated in China emergency patients. This trail is&#xD;
      going to determine the optimal diagnostic cut-off value of NSTEMI in Chinese population&#xD;
      according to 24-hour or longer clinical diagnosis of MI in routine way.&#xD;

      Cardiac Troponin is recommended as a preferred cardiac biomarker in third universal&#xD;
      definition of myocardial infraction. The validated high-sensitive cardiac troponin I is also&#xD;
      considered competent 1-hour algorithm to rule out and/ rule in NSTEMI in 2015 ESC Guidelines&#xD;
      for the management of acute coronary syndromes in patients presenting without persistent&#xD;
      ST-segment elevation. However, the diagnostic threshold of 1-hour and 3-hour need more solid&#xD;
      evidence in Chinese population. This study is to validate 1-hour and 3-hours diagnostic&#xD;
      strategy using Architect high-sensitivity cardiac troponin I (hs-cTnI) in Chinese patients&#xD;
      with suspected non-ST-elevation Myocardial Infarction (NSTEMI). The accuracy of 1-hour and&#xD;
      3-hours algorithm of NSTEMI using Architect hs-cTnI assays will be assessment in China&#xD;
      emergency patients. This trail is going to determine the optimal diagnostic cut-off value of&#xD;
      NSTEMI in Chinese population according to 24-hour or even longer clinical diagnosis of MI in&#xD;
      routine way.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In primary phase of the present study, 400 patients with acute chest pain, who suspected&#xD;
      NSTE-ACS, will be enrolled when visiting emergency department of Fuwai hospital. In&#xD;
      subsequent study, multi center emergency department in China plan to recruit 2000 patients&#xD;
      suspected NSTE-ACS. The inclusion and exclusion criteria had been described in the following&#xD;
      eligibility part. All recruited patients undergo an initial clinical assessment including&#xD;
      clinical history, physical examination, 12-lead ECG monitoring, routine blood measurements&#xD;
      and echocardiogram. The blood samples of patients will be collected according to standard&#xD;
      biobank protocol. Cardiac troponin I, CK-MB and myoglobin will be measured at presentation,&#xD;
      1-hour, 3-hours and 12-hours employing contemporary cTnI and high-sensitive cTnI,&#xD;
      respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The diagnosis of each enrolled patient will be made according to routine clinical approach&#xD;
      and 1-hour and 3-hours clinical approach, respectively. The routine clinical diagnosis will&#xD;
      be made by cardiologist panel according to third universal definition of myocardial&#xD;
      infraction through reviewing all available medical records. The NSTEMI diagnosis depended on&#xD;
      Architect hs-cTnI assessment will be made a senior cardiologist according to 1-hour and&#xD;
      3-hours clinical approach recommended by 2015 ESC guidelines for the management of NSTEMI.&#xD;
      When there was disagreement about the diagnosis, cases were reviewed and adjudicated in&#xD;
      conjunction with a third senior cardiologist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Finally, statistical expert will evaluate the diagnostic performance of 1-hour and 3-hours&#xD;
      clinical approach and diagnostic threshold of NSTEMI when the new hs-cTnI employed.&#xD;
