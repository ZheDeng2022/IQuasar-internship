  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the efficacy of REGN3500 monotherapy&#xD;
      compared with placebo treatment in adult patients with moderate-to-severe Atopic dermatitis&#xD;
      (AD).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives are to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluate the efficacy of REGN3500 in combination with dupilumab compared with placebo&#xD;
           treatment in adult patients with moderate-to-severe AD&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Assess the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of subcutaneous (SC) doses of&#xD;
           REGN3500 monotherapy and REGN3500 in combination with dupilumab in adult patients with&#xD;
           moderate-to-severe AD&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluate the Pharmacokinetic (PK) of REGN3500 monotherapy and REGN3500 in combination&#xD;

    <description>The EASI score was used to measure the severity and extent of atopic dermatitis (AD) and measures erythema, induration, excoriation and lichenification on 4 anatomic regions of the body: head, trunk, upper and lower extremities. The total EASI score ranges from 0 (minimum) to 72 (maximum) points, with the higher scores reflecting the worse severity of AD. Percent change from baseline in EASI score at Week 16 based on observed values set to missing after rescue treatment was reported. Values after first rescue treatment were set to missing and participants with missing EASI score at Week 16 were counted as non-responders.</description>

Due to study discontinuation, not all planned participants were enrolled. For those already enrolled, the study drug was discontinued and participants were transitioned to post-treatment follow-up period. A large amount of data remained uncollected as not all enrolled participants completed all planned study visits and procedures for assessments for some endpoints. Therefore, this endpoint was removed and no data was collected for this outcome measure.</description>

The total EASI score ranges from 0 (minimum) to 72 (maximum) points, with the higher scores reflecting the worse severity of AD. Percent change from baseline in EASI score at Week 16 based on observed values set to missing after rescue treatment was reported.

        <title>Absolute Change From Baseline in Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI) Score Based on All Observed Values Regardless of Rescue Treatment at Week 16</title>
        <description>The EASI score was used to measure the severity and extent of AD and measures erythema, induration, excoriation and lichenification on 4 anatomic regions of the body: head, trunk, upper and lower extremities. The total EASI score ranges from 0 (minimum) to 72 (maximum) points, with the higher scores reflecting the worse severity of AD. Absolute change from baseline in EASI score at Week 16 based on all observed values regardless of rescue treatment was reported.</description>

        <title>Absolute Change From Baseline in Weekly Average of Daily Peak Pruritus NRS Score Based on All Observed Values Regardless of Rescue Treatment at Week 16</title>
        <description>Pruritus NRS was an assessment tool used to report the intensity of a participant's pruritus (itch), both maximum and average intensity, using an electronic questionnaire (e-diary). Participants were asked the following question: how would you rate your itch at the worst moment during the previous 24 hours (for maximum itch intensity on a scale of 0 - 10 [0 = no itch; 10 = worst itch imaginable]). Absolute change from baseline in weekly average of daily Peak Pruritus NRS score at Week 16 based on all observed values regardless of rescue treatment was reported.</description>

Participants were asked the following question: how would you rate your itch at the worst moment during the previous 24 hours (for maximum itch intensity on a scale of 0 - 10 [0 = no itch; 10 = worst itch imaginable]). Percentage of participants with improvement of weekly average of daily peak pruritus NRS from baseline to Week 16 based on observed values set to missing after rescue treatment were reported. Values after first rescue treatment were set to missing and participants with missing NRS at Week 16 were counted as non-responders.</description>

      <restrictive_agreement>The investigator has the right to independently publish study results from the investigator's site after a multi-center publication, or a defined period after the completion of the study by all sites. The investigator must provide the sponsor a copy of any such publication derived from the study for review and comment in advance of any submission, and delay publication, if requested, to allow the Sponsor to preserve its proprietary rights.</restrictive_agreement>
    </certain_agreements>
    <limitations_and_caveats>The decision was made by the sponsor to terminate the study on 12 Feb 2020 due to lack of efficacy. Study enrollment was not complete at that time, therefore planned sample sizes were not met. Participants discontinued study drug and transitioned into the post-treatment follow-up period. As a result of the decision to terminate the study, all statistical analyses were descriptive and no hypothesis testing was performed.</limitations_and_caveats>
