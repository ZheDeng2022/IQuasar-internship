      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are many people living with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection in Liberia.&#xD;
      Most experts consider HIV an epidemic there. Researchers want to collect health data from&#xD;
      Liberians with HIV over several years. This may help HIV prevention and treatment programs in&#xD;
      Liberia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To learn more about how HIV affects people in Liberia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      People with HIV in Liberia&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be screened with a blood sample.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will visit the study clinic about 10 times over 3 years. They will need to&#xD;
      return to the clinic after some visits to get test results. The visits will be closer&#xD;
      together during the first part of the study and less frequent later.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At each study visit, participants will:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Have a brief physical exam&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Answer questions about how they are feeling and what medicines they are taking&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Have blood taken from an arm vein by a needle&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Give urine samples&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants ages 12 years or older may be asked questions about HIV risk behaviors. These&#xD;
      include sex practices and drug use. Participants ages 18 years or older may be asked how&#xD;
      their&#xD;
&#xD;
      HIV infection makes them feel emotionally.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants may be asked to join a research substudy. This will be about tuberculosis (TB)&#xD;
      testing in people with HIV. For this substudy, participants will have a TB skin test. A small&#xD;
      amount of liquid will be injected under the skin on the arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will return to the clinic a few days later. The test area will be checked. They&#xD;
      will get their test results.&#xD;
&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Resources for management of HIV-positive individuals are extremely limited in the West&#xD;
      African country of Liberia, and many knowledge gaps exist about the nature of the HIV&#xD;
      epidemic in this country. While the prevalence is likely low compared to other regions in&#xD;
      Sub-Saharan Africa, the burden of disease is likely high given the current state of the&#xD;
      Liberian health care system, despite attempts to improve HIV treatment services and coverage.&#xD;
      The Ebola epidemic of 2014-2016 created tremendous strain on a health care system already&#xD;
      weakened by years of civil strife, and it is suspected that care for many HIV-positive&#xD;
      individuals was disrupted by this event. Currently, clinicians do not have regular access to&#xD;
      measurements of CD4 levels or viral loads, making management of people living with HIV in&#xD;
      Liberia difficult. While there is some access to antiretroviral (ARV) medications through the&#xD;
      National AIDS and Sexually Transmitted Infection (STI) Control Program, several details,&#xD;
      including the extent of this access and the impact on disease outcomes, remain unknown. This&#xD;
      cohort study will examine these basic factors; attempt to characterize major&#xD;
      social/demographic, clinical, immunologic, and virologic features of HIV/AIDS; and&#xD;
      investigate the course of HIV disease, including rates of hospitalization, frequencies of ARV&#xD;
      regimen modifications, and incidence of certain opportunistic diseases, STIs, other&#xD;
      co-infections, and non-AIDS comorbidities among those who are enrolled. Study participants&#xD;
      will attend periodic study visits over 3 years. Clinical information will be collected, as&#xD;
      will blood and urine samples for clinical and research tests. This protocol is not designed&#xD;
      to estimate the prevalence of HIV infection; however, it provides a unique opportunity to&#xD;
      generate quality data to understand the course and epidemiology of HIV and AIDS in Liberia.&#xD;
      It also provides an opportunity to contribute to the quality and impact of HIV prevention,&#xD;
      treatment, and care programs in Liberia.&#xD;
