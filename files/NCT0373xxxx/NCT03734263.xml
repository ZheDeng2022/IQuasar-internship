  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study phenylbutyrate is used for patients with pyruvate dehydrogenase complex&#xD;
      deficiency. The aim of the study is to investigate the safety and efficacy of therapy.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The Investigator will evaluate the safety and efficacy of a 4-weeks treatment with sodium&#xD;
      phenylbutyrate in patients with pyruvate dehydrogenase complex deficiency. Efficacy will be&#xD;
      evaluated based on biochemical endpoints (blood lactate and pyruvate).&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>An open-label, uncontrolled, multicentric clinical trial will be performed on pediatric patients with PDC deficiency. Enrolled subjects will receive a four-week period of treatment with NaPB; primary and secondary endpoints will be evaluated at defined time points. Before NaPB treatment, all patients will undergo a four-week period of observation during which the same parameters will be analyzed at different time points, with the aim of evaluating basal conditions in the absence of treatment.</intervention_model_description>
