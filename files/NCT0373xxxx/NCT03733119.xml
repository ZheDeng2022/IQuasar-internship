  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well Akt/ERK inhibitor ONC201 (ONC201) with a&#xD;
      methionine-restricted (MR) diet works in treating participants with triple negative breast&#xD;
      cancer that has spread to other places in the body or cannot be removed by surgery. ONC201&#xD;
      activates a process that leads to the death of a cell. ONC201 is able to target tumor cells&#xD;
      to get rid of them, but does not affect normal cells. MR diet is a methionine-free amino acid&#xD;
      modified medical food. The addition of an intermittent MR diet may enhance the activity of&#xD;
      ONC201. Giving ONC201 and an MR diet may work better in treating participants with breast&#xD;
      cancer.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine objective response rate (ORR) to ONC201 with a methionine-restricted diet in&#xD;
      patients with metastatic triple negative breast cancer (TNBC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine progression-free survival (PFS) to ONC201 with a methionine-restricted diet&#xD;
      in patients with metastatic TNBC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To determine clinical benefit rate (complete or partial response plus stable disease)&#xD;
      (CBR) at 4 months to ONC201 with a methionine-restricted diet in patients with metastatic&#xD;
      TNBC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To determine overall survival (OS) to ONC201 with a methionine-restricted diet in&#xD;
      patients with metastatic TNBC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To assess metabolic indices in patients with metastatic TNBC treated with ONC201 and a&#xD;
      methionine-restricted diet.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. To assess the expression of TRAIL receptor in circulating tumor cells (CTCs) prior, during&#xD;
      and upon progression in patients with metastatic TNBC treated with ONC201 with a&#xD;
      methionine-restricted diet.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine time to development of brain metastases or worsening of brain metastases in&#xD;
      patients with metastatic TNBC treated with ONC201 with a methionine-restricted diet.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY DESIGN Patients with metastatic TNBC will be enrolled in a single-arm study evaluating&#xD;
      ONC201 with a methionine-restricted diet.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, participants are followed up every 3 months for 2 years.&#xD;
