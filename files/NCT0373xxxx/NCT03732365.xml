  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized study to compare the safety and efficacy of a single dose of up to 2&#xD;
      grams of cefazolin administered using a new drug delivery method called Ultrasonic Drug&#xD;
      Delivery (UDD), combined with standard of care (SOC) antibiotic therapy, oral or IV, compared&#xD;
      to standard of care (SOC) antibiotic therapy alone, in treating chronic wounds with skin and&#xD;
      soft tissue infection, containing gram-positive pathogens, in lower extremities.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 2, single-center, parallel-group study to compare the efficacy and safety of&#xD;
      UDD plus standard of care (SOC) with SOC alone for the treatment of skin and soft tissue&#xD;
      infections in non-healing wounds. After review of screening results to determine eligibility,&#xD;
      a patient will be randomly assigned to one of the two treatments:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigational Group: This group will receive administration of a single dose of cefazolin,&#xD;
      using a novel new drug delivery system called Ultrasonic Drug Delivery (UDD), to the site of&#xD;
      infection, combined with SOC, followed by best available adjunct therapy. An optional two&#xD;
      additional treatments will be available if needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Comparator Group: This group will receive conventional standard of care treatment followed by&#xD;
      best available adjunct therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Efficacy will be assessed by clinical response based on the presence of vascularized&#xD;
      granulation tissue, reduction of pain, temperature, measurement of lesion size and&#xD;
      temperature, culture and gram stain results, and clinical signs of infection (erythema,&#xD;
      induration/swelling, fluctuance, purulent drainage, warmth/localized heat, and&#xD;
      tenderness/pain). Additionally, efficacy will be assessed by resolution of infection and&#xD;
      microbiological assessments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety will be assessed by reported adverse events, clinical laboratory tests (hematology,&#xD;
      serum chemistry, fasting glucose, hs-CRP), and concomitant medication.&#xD;

    <masking_description>This study will be observer-blinded. Each investigational site will be required to have a Sponsor-approved plan (a site-specific Blinding Plan) that describes site-specific precautions being taken to ensure that the study is observer-blinded, taking into account the specific subject care procedures, equipment, and information accessibility at that site. At each investigational site, at least 1 blinded investigator (referred to as &quot;Blinded Observer&quot;) will not know the subject's treatment assignment and will conduct clinical assessments (including efficacy and safety. The Blinded Observer will not ask other members of the study team, the subject, or the subject's parent(s)/legally acceptable representative(s) which study treatment is being given, and will avoid all attempts to uncover treatment assignment. The Blinded Observer will see the subject during times when study treatment is NOT being administered.</masking_description>
