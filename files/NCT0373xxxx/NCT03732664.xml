      The proposed study will evaluate the safety and feasibility of preoperative administration&#xD;
      nivolumab in patients with high-risk resectable NSCLC, and will facilitate a comprehensive&#xD;
      exploratory characterization of the tumor immune milieu and circulating immune cells and&#xD;
      soluble factors in these patients. Data obtained in this study will provide valuable&#xD;
      information for planning further prospective clinical trials of anti-PD-1 and other&#xD;
      immunotherapies in NSCLC, both in the peri-operative and advanced disease setting.&#xD;

      The proposed study will evaluate the safety and feasibility of preoperative administration&#xD;

      information for planning further prospective clinical trials of anti-PD-1 and other&#xD;
      immunotherapies in NSCLC, both in the peri-operative and advanced disease setting.&#xD;
      Ultimately, it is highly desirable to discover prospective biomarkers of response and&#xD;
      toxicity to allow patients with NSCLC who are most likely to derive benefit to receive&#xD;
      anti-PD-1 treatment, and conversely to minimize the risk of toxicity and ineffective&#xD;
      treatment for patients who are unlikely to benefit.&#xD;

&#xD;
               -  Subjects must have adequate lung function to permit surgical resection determined&#xD;
                  by pre-enrollment pulmonary function tests to include DLCO.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The effects of nivolumab on the developing human fetus are unknown. For this reason,&#xD;
             women of child-bearing potential (WOCBP) and men must agree to use adequate&#xD;
             contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study&#xD;
             entry and for the duration of study participation and for up to 23 weeks after the&#xD;
             last dose of nivolumab. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant&#xD;
             while she or her partner is participating in this study, she should inform her&#xD;
             treating physician immediately. Sexually active fertile men must use effective barrier&#xD;
             birth control if their partners are WOCBP for up to 31 weeks after the last dose of&#xD;
             nivolumab. WOCBP must have a negative serum or urine pregnancy test (minimum&#xD;
             sensitivity 25 IU/L or equivalent units of HCG) within two weeks of registration.&#xD;
             Women must not be breastfeeding.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient understands the study regimen, its requirements, risks and discomforts and is&#xD;
             able and willing to sign the informed consent form. Voluntary signed and dated IRB/IEC&#xD;
             approved written informed consent form in accordance with regulatory and institutional&#xD;
             guidelines must be obtained before the performance of any protocol related procedures&#xD;
             that are not part of normal patient care. Subjects must be competent to report AEs,&#xD;
             understand the drug dosing schedule and use of medications to control AEs.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects are excluded if they have an active, known or suspected autoimmune disease.&#xD;
             Subjects are permitted to enroll if they have vitiligo, type I diabetes mellitus,&#xD;
             residual hypothyroidism due to autoimmune condition only requiring hormone&#xD;
             replacement, psoriasis not requiring systemic treatment, or conditions not expected to&#xD;
             recur in the absence of an external trigger.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects are excluded if they have a condition requiring systemic treatment with&#xD;
             either corticosteroids (&gt; 10 mg daily prednisone equivalents) or other&#xD;
             immunosuppressive medications within 14 days of study drug administration. Inhaled or&#xD;
             topical steroids and adrenal replacement doses &gt; 10 mg daily prednisone equivalents&#xD;
             are permitted in the absence of active autoimmune disease. As there is potential for&#xD;
             hepatic toxicity with nivolumab or nivolumab/ipilimumab combinations, drugs with a&#xD;
             predisposition to hepatoxicity should be used with caution in patients treated with&#xD;
             nivolumab-containing regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Administration of chemotherapy or any other cancer therapy in the pre-operative&#xD;
             period.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects with active concurrent malignancies are excluded i.e. cancers other than&#xD;
             NSCLC (except non melanoma skin cancers, in situ bladder, gastric, breast, colon or&#xD;
             cervical cancers/dysplasia).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects with brain metastasis are excluded from this study, and all patients should&#xD;
             have brain imaging (either MRI brain or CT brain with contrast) prior to enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects with a history of symptomatic interstitial lung disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Active systemic infection requiring therapy, positive tests for Hepatitis B surface&#xD;
             antigen or Hepatitis C ribonucleic acid (RNA).&#xD;

          -  History of allergy to study drug components.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Women who are pregnant or nursing.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Men with female partners (WOCBP) that are not willing to use contraception.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prior therapy with an anti-PD-1, anti-PD-L1, anti-PDL-2, or anti-CTLA-4 antibody (or&#xD;
             any other antibody targeting T cell co-regulatory pathways).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Underlying medical conditions that, in the Investigator's opinion, will make the&#xD;
             administration of study drug hazardous or obscure the interpretation of toxicity or&#xD;
             adverse events.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prisoners or subjects who are involuntarily incarcerated or compulsorily detained for&#xD;
             treatment of either a psychiatric or physical (e.g. infectious disease) illness.&#xD;
