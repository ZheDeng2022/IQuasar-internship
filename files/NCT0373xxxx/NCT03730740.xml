  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of lenalidomide maintenance therapy in&#xD;
      patients with T-cell lymphoma who have undergone more than one treatment or relapsed after&#xD;
      treatment and who acquired a response of more than a partial response after rescue&#xD;
      chemotherapy. This is a phase 2 clinical trial.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      T-cell lymphoma that has relapsed after primary treatment or is refractory to treatment&#xD;
      generally requires salvage therapy. In case of partial or complete response to such salvage&#xD;
      therapy (partial response is determined by CT), consolidation therapy is performed to&#xD;
      maintain the response and prevent relapse and autologous stem cell transplantation after&#xD;
      high-dosage chemotherapy is generally adopted. However, autologous stem cell transplantation&#xD;
      is unavailable if patient is over 65 years of age or not in a good full-body condition and&#xD;
      additional treatment plans are required to prevent relapse in such cases. Allogenic stem cell&#xD;
      transplantation after salvage therapy is also available in limited events in case of relapse&#xD;
      after autologous stem cell transplantation and the effect of allogenic stem cell&#xD;
      transplantation still not definite but experimental.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As a result, the treatment results of T-cell lymphoma that has relapsed are very poor despite&#xD;
      active application of salvage therapy and overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival&#xD;
      (PFS) have only been 5.5 and 3.1 months as a result of a previous study on 153 patients.&#xD;
      Also, 3-year PFS after primary relapse was reportedly 16%. Likewise, overall survival (OS) of&#xD;
      patients with T-cell lymphoma who experienced relapse or progression within first 24 months&#xD;
      of diagnosis was 4.9 months (95% CI: 3.8-5.9 months). Therefore, additional therapy&#xD;
      strategies are required to prevent relapse or progression of disease in patients who received&#xD;
      salvage therapy for relapsed and/or refractory T-cell lymphoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently, the results of phase 2 study were reported where progressive survival period was&#xD;
      effectively extended with Lenalidomide Maintenance for patients with relapsed and/or&#xD;
      refractory diffuse large B cell lymphoma in cases where autologous stem cell transplantation&#xD;
      is unattainable after salvage therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lenalidomide controls the immune system to activate the T cells or NK cells in the&#xD;
      microenvironment of tumor for anti-tumor effects. Also, it combines with cerebron to lower&#xD;
      IKZF1 and IKZF3 and inhibit MYC through the NF-kB route. MYC inhibition by Lenalidomide&#xD;
      eventually lowers IRF4 to increase apoptosis and inhibit cell proliferation and induce&#xD;
      anti-cancer effect accordingly . As a result, Lenalidomide was recognized as a treatment for&#xD;
      multiple myeloma and lymphoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The results of clinical studies on the effect of Lenalidomide for T-cell lymphoma are still&#xD;
      limited, but 26% OS has been reported for patients with T-cell lymphoma as a result of phase&#xD;
      2 clinical test where 25 mg (Day 1 - Day21, every 28 days) Lenalidomide was used as the only&#xD;
      drug. Also, it has been proven that the increase of IRF4/MUM1, one of the major targets of&#xD;
      Lenalidomide, is related to the poor prognosis of T-cell lymphoma, so the effect of&#xD;
      Lenalidomide can be expected for T-cell lymphoma. Therefore, this study was conducted to&#xD;
      evaluate the efficacies and safety of Lenalidomide Maintenance on patients who have shown&#xD;
      partial response or complete response to salvage therapy for T-cell lymphoma that have been&#xD;
      progressive after one or more therapies or relapsed after treatment.&#xD;
