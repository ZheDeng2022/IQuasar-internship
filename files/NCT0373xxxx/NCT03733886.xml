  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the effect of Burst spinal cord stimulation (SCS) in the treatment&#xD;
      of painful radiculopathy in lower extremity(ies) with or without lower back pain. It is a&#xD;
      multicenter double-blinded &quot;n-of-1&quot; RCT with repeated two-week periods of Burst SCS or sham&#xD;
      in randomised order.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      SCS is a treatment offered to patients with peripheral neuropathic pain, and involves&#xD;
      electrical stimulation of the spinal cord. The analgesic effect is possibly mediated via both&#xD;
      spinal and supra-spinal mechanisms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Traditional &quot;tonic&quot; SCS causes paresthesia during treatment, but the newer burst technique&#xD;
      (five electrical pulses at 500Hz delivered in intermittent packets of 40 Hz) can be performed&#xD;
      below detection level. Thus, it is possible to do double-blinded sham-controlled studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, we will study the effect of burst SCS compared with sham on pain intensity and&#xD;
      function (Patient-Specific Functional Scale). In addition, we will use several questionnaires&#xD;
      (psychometric data, health-related quality of life, sleep, global impression of change, use&#xD;
      of analgesics, blinding).&#xD;
