    <textblock>
      This study will assess the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and antiviral activity of&#xD;
      long-acting cabotegravir (CAB LA) plus the broadly neutralizing monoclonal antibody,&#xD;
      VRC-HIVMAB075-00-AB (VRC07-523LS), in adults living with HIV-1 with suppressed plasma&#xD;
      viremia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be conducted in three steps. At Step 1 entry, all participants will&#xD;
      discontinue their current antiretroviral therapy (ART) regimen except for nucleoside reverse&#xD;
      transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs), and initiate oral CAB.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During Step 1, participants tolerating oral CAB plus their current two NRTIs, and displaying&#xD;
      viral suppression (HIV-1 RNA &lt;50 copies/mL), will register to Step 2. At entry into Step 2,&#xD;
      eligible participants will stop their oral CAB and NRTIs and will receive a VRC07-523LS&#xD;
      infusion plus CAB LA injection. After entry in Step 2, participants will receive CAB LA every&#xD;
      4 weeks through Week R2+44 plus VRC07-523LS every 8 weeks through Week R2+40.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the last visit in Step 2 (Week R2+48), or at premature study treatment discontinuation,&#xD;
      all participants who received any CAB LA or VRC07-523LS will enter Step 3 and switch to&#xD;
      standard of care (SOC) oral ART for approximately 48 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will attend a number of study visits throughout the study. Study visits may&#xD;
      include a physical examination, clinical assessment, pregnancy testing, and blood and urine&#xD;
      collection. Participants will remain in the study for up to 101 weeks, including&#xD;
      approximately 5 weeks in Step 1, 48 weeks in Step 2, followed by 48 weeks in Step 3.&#xD;

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Step 1 Inclusion Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  HIV-1 infection, documented by any licensed rapid HIV test or HIV enzyme or&#xD;
             chemiluminescence immunoassay (E/CIA) test kit at any time prior to study entry and&#xD;
             confirmed by a licensed Western blot or a second antibody test by a method other than&#xD;
             the initial rapid HIV and/or E/CIA, or by HIV-1 antigen, plasma HIV-1 RNA viral load.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  NOTE: The term &quot;licensed&quot; refers to a US Food and Drug Administration&#xD;
                  (FDA)-approved kit, which is required for all IND studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  World Health Organization (WHO) and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&#xD;
                  (CDC) guidelines mandate that confirmation of the initial test result must use a&#xD;
                  test that is different from the one used for the initial assessment. A reactive&#xD;
                  initial rapid test should be confirmed by either another type of rapid assay or&#xD;
                  an E/CIA that is based on a different antigen preparation and/or different test&#xD;
                  principle (e.g., indirect versus competitive), or a Western blot or a plasma&#xD;
                  HIV-1 RNA viral load.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Clinically stable (i.e.,in the opinion of the site investigator, doing well and not&#xD;
             sick from treatment) for at least 8 weeks prior to study entry on a three-drug ART&#xD;
             regimen that includes a boosted protease inhibitor, a nonnucleoside reverse&#xD;
             transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI), or an integrase inhibitor, plus two NRTIs, with no&#xD;
             history of a switch due to virologic failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  NOTE: Previous switches for reasons other than virologic failure prior to&#xD;
                  screening are allowed.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Screening CD4+ T-cell count greater than or equal to 350 cells/mm^3 obtained within 60&#xD;
             days prior to study entry at any US laboratory that has a Clinical Laboratory&#xD;
             Improvement Amendments (CLIA) certification or its equivalent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  All available HIV-1 RNA measurements must be less than 50 copies/mL within the 2 years&#xD;
             prior to study entry except as allowed by the note below.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  NOTE: One plasma HIV-1 RNA greater than or equal to 50 copies/mL but less than&#xD;
                  200 copies/mL is allowed if followed by a subsequent HIV-1 RNA value below 50&#xD;
                  copies/mL.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants must have at least two documented HIV-1 RNA less than 50 copies/mL within&#xD;
             12 months prior to study entry.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  NOTE: The HIV-1 RNA level obtained at the screening visit can be used as the&#xD;
                  second measurement, but must meet the requirements of screening plasma HIV-1 RNA&#xD;
                  criterion below.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Screening plasma HIV-1 RNA less than 50 copies/mL by any FDA-approved assay with&#xD;
             minimum limit of detection of 50 copies/mL or lower obtained within 60 days prior to&#xD;
             study entry by any US laboratory that has a CLIA certification or its equivalent.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  For females of reproductive potential, negative serum or urine pregnancy test within&#xD;
             48 hours prior to entry by any clinic or laboratory that has a CLIA certification or&#xD;
             its equivalent, or is using a point of care (POC)/CLIA-waived test.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  NOTE A: Reproductive potential is defined as girls who have reached menarche and&#xD;
                  women who have had menses within the prior 12 months, and have not undergone&#xD;
                  surgical sterilization. If no menses for a year or longer, the&#xD;
                  follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) should be less than or equal to 40 IU/mL to be&#xD;
                  considered of reproductive potential. If an FSH is not available, and they have&#xD;
                  not had menses in 24 or more consecutive months, they would be considered not to&#xD;
                  be of reproductive potential. Women who have undergone surgical sterilization&#xD;
                  (e.g., hysterectomy, bilateral oophorectomy, tubal micro-inserts, tubal ligation&#xD;
                  or salpingectomy) are considered not to be of reproductive potential.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  NOTE B: Participant-reported history of hysterectomy and bilateral oophorectomy,&#xD;
                  tubal ligation, bilateral salpingectomy, tubal micro-inserts, and menopause is&#xD;
                  acceptable documentation.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Female participants of reproductive potential, who are participating in sexual&#xD;
                  activity that could lead to pregnancy, must agree to use an effective form of&#xD;
                  contraception from 30 days prior to the first dose of study medication, while&#xD;
                  receiving the study drugs, and for 30 days after stopping oral medications, or&#xD;
                  the duration specified in the product label if receiving ARV drugs not supplied&#xD;
                  by the study, or for approximately 48 weeks after last dose of CAB LA or&#xD;
                  VRC07-523LS. Acceptable methods of contraception include:&#xD;

&#xD;
               -  Women who are not of reproductive potential are eligible to start study treatment&#xD;
                  drugs without requiring the use of contraceptives. Refer to above criterion for&#xD;
                  definition of female who is not of reproductive potential.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  NOTE: All participants in the study should be counseled on safer sexual practices&#xD;
                  including the use and benefit/risk of effective barrier methods (e.g., male&#xD;
                  condom) and on the risk of HIV transmission to a partner without HIV.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Men and women aged greater than or equal to 18 years.&#xD;
