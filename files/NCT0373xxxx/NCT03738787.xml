  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study evaluates the safety and efficacy of Neoprene-based glue in the management of&#xD;
      pancreatic stump after pancreatoduodenectomy (PD) in patients at high risk for pancreatic&#xD;
      fistula and early neoplastic recurrence, compared with a population of patients at&#xD;
      conventional risk.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Although improved in many aspects, the PD intervention is still burdened by a significant&#xD;
      morbidity, related above all to the delicate phase following the removal of the tumor which&#xD;
      involves the reconstruction of the gastro-enteric, biliary and especially pancreatic pathway.&#xD;
      Among the many variants of the reconstructive phase, that of pancreato-jejunal anastomosis is&#xD;
      the one burdened by the highest complication rate (quantified around 40%, with a percentage&#xD;
      of pancreatic fistula between 5% and 35%).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In cases at risk of pancreatic fistula it is possible not to perform a conventional&#xD;
      pancreato-jejunal anastomosis, but to decide to inject into the pancreatic stump the&#xD;
      solidifying glues with the aim of inducing a chemical pancreatectomy of the exocrine&#xD;
      component of the pancreas.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Neoprene® (Polychloroprene) has the property of polymerizing and solidifying in an&#xD;
      environment with a pH lower than its own (pH &lt;12).&#xD;
&#xD;
      After a systematic review of the sporadic experiences of chemical pancreatectomy published&#xD;
      until today, due to the increased complexity of the surgical cases of patients undergoing PD,&#xD;
      the investigators have undertaken a formal, single-center prospective study, aimed at&#xD;
      clarifying the safety and efficacy data of a Neoprene®-based glue in patients selected&#xD;
      through objective criteria (such as the high risk of pancreatic fistula and early tumor&#xD;
      recovery after pancreatoduodenectomy).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study is expected the prospective collection of a cohort of patients with tumor of&#xD;
      the head of the pancreas, papilla, duodenum and distal choledochus to undergo&#xD;
      pancreatoduodenectomy (PD) at high risk of pancreatic fistula and / or local recurrence&#xD;
      (&quot;Study Arm&quot;).&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the same time a second cohort of patients with the same type of neoplasia will be&#xD;
      collected, subjected to PD intervention in which however it will be possible to proceed with&#xD;
      pancreato-jejunal anastomosis. This group will be defined as &quot;Control Arm&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first cohort will be the group of patients in which to detect the safety and efficacy of&#xD;
      the treatment with Neoprene®-based glue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The second cohort will be the comparative control group against which patients treated with&#xD;
      Neoprene®-based glue can be compared in the hypothesis that peri-operative&#xD;
      morbidity,mortality and short and long-term side effects of the intervention are equivalent.&#xD;
