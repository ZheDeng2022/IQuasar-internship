    <textblock>
      This trial studies how well online psychosocial intervention works in improving social&#xD;
      well-being and support in women who are undergoing treatment for stage I-IV non-small cell&#xD;
      lung cancer. Psychosocial intervention techniques, such as mindfulness, compassion, and&#xD;
      emotional processing, may improve distress and help patients manage symptoms related to&#xD;
      non-small cell lung cancer.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Examine the feasibility (primary outcome) of the BREATHE intervention in women with lung&#xD;
      cancer (LC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Establish the initial intervention efficacy regarding psychological distress (secondary&#xD;
      outcome) and cancer symptoms (tertiary outcome) relative to an education comparison (EC)&#xD;
      group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Explore potential mediation (e.g., mindfulness, compassion, inflammatory processes) and&#xD;
      moderation (e.g., demographic and medical factors) of the intervention effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      GROUP I (PSYCHOLOGICAL): Patients participate in 5 psychological sessions and complete&#xD;
      training on mindfulness, compassion, emotional processing, social support, generating&#xD;
      positive emotions, and proactive coping strategies once a week for up to 5 weeks. Patients&#xD;
      also complete questionnaires over 35 minutes and participate in video-based group sessions&#xD;
      weekly for 5 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      GROUP II (EDUCATIONAL): Patients participate in 5 information sessions and receive education&#xD;
      on lung cancer, symptom management, communication, and practicing self-care once a week for&#xD;
      up to 5 weeks. Patients also complete questionnaires and participate in group sessions as in&#xD;
      group I.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study intervention, patients are followed up at 1 week and at 3 months.&#xD;

    <measure>Efficacy regarding psychological distress: CES-D</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>The study will examine preliminary evidence of intervention efficacy. Will calculate effect sizes for between-group comparisons based on the primary efficacy endpoint of Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D), a 20-item self-report measure focusing on the affective component of depression.&#xD;
Answers range from: almost never (less than 1 day), sometimes (1 to 2 days), often (3 to 4 days), almost always (5 to 7 days).</description>

    <measure>Efficacy regarding cancer symptoms: IES</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>The study will examine preliminary evidence of intervention efficacy. Will calculate effect sizes for between-group comparisons based on the primary efficacy endpoint of Impact of Event Scale (IES) measured at T2 using analysis of covariance (ANCOVA). IES scale answers range from NOT AT ALL, RARELY, SOMETIMES, OFTEN.</description>
