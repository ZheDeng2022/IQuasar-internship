      The purpose of this study is to validate the oxygen saturation (SpO2) accuracy of the Polso&#xD;
      Monitoring System during non-motion conditions over the range of 70-100% SaO2 as compared to&#xD;
      arterial blood samples assessed by CO-Oximetry for SpO2 validation&#xD;

      The purpose of this study is to validate the SpO2 accuracy and performance of the Polso&#xD;
      Monitoring System during non-motion conditions over the range of 70-100% SaO2 as compared to&#xD;
      arterial blood samples assessed by CO-Oximetry for SpO2 validation. It is expected that the&#xD;
      Accuracy Root Mean Square (Arms) performance of the Polso Monitoring System will meet a&#xD;
      specification of 3.5% or less in non-motion conditions for the range of 70-100% SaO2 thereby&#xD;
      demonstrating an acceptable SpO2 accuracy performance specification.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Control Pulse Oximeter, an FDA cleared device, is used to monitor the oxygen saturation&#xD;
      levels real time throughout the study for subject safety and to target stable plateaus. This&#xD;
      device is used to assess the stability of the data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A whole blood analyzer (CO-Oximeter) is used as the reference standard device for obtaining&#xD;
      the functional SaO2 value from arterial blood samples obtained during the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A minimum of 10 healthy adult subjects, ranging in pigmentation from light to dark, will be&#xD;
      enrolled in the study to meet the study design requirements defined by ISO 80601-2-61:2011&#xD;
      and by the FDA's Guidance for Pulse Oximeters. The subjects will have an arterial catheter&#xD;
      placed in the radial artery to allow for simultaneous blood samples during stable plateaus of&#xD;
      induced hypoxic levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study population will include 10-15 healthy non-smoking (or has refrained from smoking&#xD;
      for 2 days) competent adults 18-50 years of age. The subject selection will be an equitable&#xD;
      distribution of males and females of any race with varying skin tones including at least 2&#xD;
      darkly pigmented subjects or 15% of the subject pool, whichever is larger. Data collection&#xD;
      will occur over a 2-5 day period for this study population.&#xD;
