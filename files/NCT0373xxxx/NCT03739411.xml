      This pilot trial studies the side effects of hyperpolarized carbon C 13 pyruvate magnetic&#xD;
      resonance imaging (MRI) in diagnosing participants with glioma. Diagnostic procedures, such&#xD;
      as hyperpolarized carbon C 13 pyruvate MRI, may help find and diagnose glioma.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To assess the safety and feasibility of hyperpolarized 13C MR metabolic imaging as a new&#xD;
           and unique tool for evaluating tumor burden and detecting early response to standard&#xD;
           therapy in patients with glioma.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To define the most appropriate imaging parameters for obtaining hyperpolarized 13C data&#xD;
           from the brain, one hundred patients with evidence of residual disease from a prior MRI&#xD;
           examination will have hyperpolarized metabolic imaging after receiving one or two&#xD;
           injections of hyperpolarized 13 C pyruvate. For subjects who are willing to receive two&#xD;
           injections, the 2nd injection will be used to assess reproducibility, evaluate the&#xD;
           performance of new acquisition methods, or compare metabolism between [1-13C]pyruvate&#xD;
           and [213C]pyruvate.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To establish the time course of changes in hyperpolarized pyruvate and lactate peaks on&#xD;
           a voxel by voxel basis from the dynamic hyperpolarized data after the injection(s) of&#xD;
           hyperpolarized 13C pyruvate. Twenty patients will be studied before and after treatment&#xD;
           with standard radiation and temozolomide in order to determine the time course of&#xD;
           delivery of 13C pyruvate and the location of maximum pyruvate and lactate or glutamate&#xD;
           signals in normal brain and in the region of T2 hyperintensity (T2L).&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To evaluate if patients who receive treatment with standard radiation and temozolomide&#xD;
           exhibit a reduction in hyperpolarized 13C lactate/pyruvate or 13C glutamate/pyruvate at&#xD;
           post-radiation follow-up compared to their baseline scan. A second group of twenty&#xD;
           patients will be studied at the time determined from the prior group to provide the&#xD;
           maximum contrast between lactate/pyruvate or glutamate/pyruvate in the lesion versus&#xD;
           normal brain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: Participants are assigned to 1 of 2 cohorts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      COHORT I: Patients receive one or two hyperpolarized carbon C 13 pyruvate injections&#xD;
      intravenously (IV) and undergo MRI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      COHORT II: Patients receive hyperpolarized carbon C 13 pyruvate IV and undergo MRI before&#xD;
      standard treatment with radiation therapy and temozolomide and 4 weeks after completion of&#xD;
      radiation therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, participants are followed for up to 24 months.&#xD;

    <description>Adverse events will be monitored from just before investigational medicinal product (IMP) administration until the end of study participation. Vital signs (blood pressure and heart rate only) will be recorded at baseline and 30 minutes post injection. For blood pressures and heart rate recorded after IMP administration, the following safety endpoints will be summarized for each part of the study: (1) The occurrence of changes from baseline, at each post-administration time point, greater than a pre-specified magnitude (20 mm Hg for systolic blood pressure, 10 mm Hg for diastolic blood pressure, 10 beats per minute for heart rate). (2) The occurrence of post-administration values outside the normal limits. Toxicities will be graded using the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology (Toxicity) Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.0</description>
