      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Approximately 150 cases of cancer per one million per year are considered rare cancers. While&#xD;
      all tumors originate from genetic changes, a small percentage of these tumors are familial.&#xD;
      Researchers want to study these changes in biological samples from people with rare tumors in&#xD;
      order to learn more about how these tumors develop. The information obtained from this study&#xD;
      may lead to improved screening, preventive guidelines, and treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To better understand rare cancers and hereditary cancer syndromes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      People who have a rare tumor, a family history of a rare tumor, a hereditary cancer syndrome,&#xD;
      or a mutation that leads to rare tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be screened with questions about their medical history and/or that of their&#xD;
      family members. They will give a saliva sample.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants who have a tumor will have their medical records and tests reviewed. They will&#xD;
      answer questions about their wellbeing and needs. They may provide a tumor tissue sample.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants may also have:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Physical exam&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Clinical photography&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood, urine, saliva, and stool samples taken&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Consultation with specialists&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A scan that produces a picture of the body. Either one that uses a small amount of&#xD;
           radiation, or one that uses a magnetic field.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Genetic testing/genetic counseling.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be contacted once a year. They will answer updated questions about their&#xD;
      medical and family history.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be asked to contact the study team if there are changes in their tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants may be invited to join focus groups for people with the same diagnosis of rare&#xD;
      tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants may be invited to participate in other NIH protocols.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rare tumors are defined as fewer than 150 incident cases per one million per year.&#xD;
      Consequently, only 11 tumor types are common in U.S. adults (prostate, breast, lung/bronchus,&#xD;
      colon, uterus, bladder, melanoma, rectum, ovary, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, and kidney/renal&#xD;
      pelvis neoplasms) and will not be studied in this trial. One-quarter of all adults with tumor&#xD;
      have a rare tumor diagnosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All pediatric tumors meet this definition of rare affecting &lt; 1% individuals younger than 20&#xD;
      years per year in the US.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Notably, there is a group of solid tumors that occur so infrequently in children and adults&#xD;
      that little is known about the natural history of these tumors, their clinical behavior,&#xD;
      molecular/genetic characteristics, optimal management, and drug response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The NCI and the NIH Clinical Center infrastructure are uniquely suited to conduct studies of&#xD;
      rare tumors. There is a precedent in the NCI when even non-interventional studies or&#xD;
      initiatives were paradigm-changing. The NCI neurofibromatosis type 1 natural history study&#xD;
      allowed the development of groundbreaking interventional trials in participants with&#xD;
      plexiform neurofibromas. The Pediatric and Wild-Type Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumor (GIST)&#xD;
      Clinic, which involves intramural and extramural experts, not only provided the background&#xD;
      for discovery of the molecular features of a very rare disease such as succinate&#xD;
      dehydrogenase deficient GIST, but also was able identify therapeutic strategies for this&#xD;
      group of participants (for example, avoidance of unnecessarily aggressive surgery).&#xD;
      Similarly, studies in adults at the CCR have tremendously advanced the understanding of rare&#xD;
      solid tumors occurring primarily in adults such as thymoma, renal cell cancer, and endocrine&#xD;
      tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Systematic and longitudinal collection and annotation of clinical history, tissue samples,&#xD;
      imaging studies, patient reported outcomes, and other pertinent information in participants&#xD;
      with these rare tumors and return of results to participants will provide a service to the&#xD;
      participants themselves and to the medical community, in line with the NIH mission of to seek&#xD;
      fundamental knowledge about the nature and behavior of living systems and the application of&#xD;
      that knowledge to enhance health, lengthen life, and reduce illness and disability .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To comprehensively and longitudinally evaluate the natural history of participants with rare&#xD;
      solid tumors or tumor predisposition syndromes, estimating and defining their clinical&#xD;
      spectrum (e.g. disease course and survival).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants with a diagnosis of a rare solid tumor (fewer than 15 cases in 100,000 people&#xD;
      per year).&#xD;
&#xD;
      OR&#xD;
&#xD;
      Relatives of participants with diagnosis of rare solid tumors&#xD;
&#xD;
      OR&#xD;
&#xD;
      Carriers of germline genetic variants that predispose to rare solid tumor and their&#xD;
      relatives.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This will be a long-term study to comprehensively study participants (and their relatives)&#xD;
      with select rare tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Initially participants will provide clinical information (medical history, family medical&#xD;
      history, imaging studies and reports, surgical pathology reports, genetic test results,&#xD;
      patient-reported outcomes) and biospecimens (archival pathology specimen and saliva) for&#xD;
      review by and feedback from the study team.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If indicated, participants will be invited to the study site for additional evaluations and&#xD;
      consultation, including clinical phenotyping, genotyping, imaging of tumor sites, and patient&#xD;
      reported or other appropriate outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After evaluation, participants will be provided with recommendations about possible treatment&#xD;
      options and might be enrolled into disease specific sub-protocols of this trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since long-term follow-up of individuals with rare tumors, their family members at high risk&#xD;
      for developing tumors, and carriers of germline genetic variants is a major feature of the&#xD;
      study, we intend to maintain active contact with study subjects for as long as possible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to evaluating individual participants, this protocol will allow bringing groups&#xD;
      of participants (approximately 10-20) with specific rare tumors for a rare tumor clinic on&#xD;
      the same day to allow for development of a deeper understanding of rare tumors through the&#xD;
      conduct of focus groups.&#xD;
