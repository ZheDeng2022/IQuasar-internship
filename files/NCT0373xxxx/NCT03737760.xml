  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to determine the central neural control of mobility in older&#xD;
      adults by acquiring data with multiple modalities of neuroimaging (EEG, fNIRS, MRI) and&#xD;
      associating these data with a comprehensive set of diverse mobility outcomes (clinic-based&#xD;
      walking, complex walking and community mobility measures).&#xD;

      This study is a longitudinal, prospective cohort study with a follow-up period of 1.2 - 3.5&#xD;
      years, dependent on when the participant enrolls. Participants will be assessed at baseline,&#xD;
      and then every six months for 3.5 years or until the study ends, whichever comes first.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators plan to enroll 200 community-dwelling men and women age 70+ years.&#xD;
