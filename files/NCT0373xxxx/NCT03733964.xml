  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study was to determine whether the use of combination therapy consisting of&#xD;
      manual therapy and proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation (PNF) is more effective than the&#xD;
      use of the techniques of manual therapy, PNF method or traditional physiotherapy as single&#xD;
      methods in the treatment of non-specific low back pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study was designed as single-blinded Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT) and conducted on a&#xD;
      group of 200 patients of Hospital in Parczew. The patients were randomly divided into four&#xD;
      50-person groups: A used manual therapy, B - PNF, C - manual therapy and PNF, and D&#xD;
      -kinesiotherapy. Pain intensity was measured using VAS and Laitinen's questionnaire.&#xD;
      Functional disability was assessed using Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) and Back Pain&#xD;
      Functional Scale (BPFS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      . The hypotheses were:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The greatest reduction of pain is observed in the combined therapy group consisting of&#xD;
           manual therapy and PNF method&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The range of movement of the lumbar spine is the most improved in the combination&#xD;
           therapy group consisting of manual therapy and PNF method.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Neurological symptoms assessed by neurodynamic tests are reduced to the greatest extent&#xD;
           in the combined therapy group consisting of manual therapy and PNF method.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. The degree of disability due to back pain as assessed using the Oswestry Disability&#xD;
           Index (ODI) decreases in all study groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. The functioning of patients in everyday life assessed using Back Pain Functional Scale&#xD;
           (BPFS) shows the biggest improvement in the combination therapy group consisting of&#xD;
           manual therapy and PNF method.&#xD;

      The research was conducted upon acquiring an approval of the Bioethical Commission of the&#xD;
      Medical University in Lublin, no. KE-0254/14/2014.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients were qualified for physiotherapeutic treatment by a physician working in the&#xD;
      given centre - a specialist on medical rehabilitation or balneotherapy and physical medicine.&#xD;
      None of the physicians were personally involved in the preparation and the manner of&#xD;
      performing the test. Before commencing the tests, each patient was familiarised with their&#xD;
      course, expressed their informed written consent for participation and random assignment to a&#xD;
      specified tested group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following selection criteria were used for the groups: the patients' age between 25 and&#xD;
      55, symptomatic spinal disc herniation of the lumbar spine at levels L4-L5 and/or L5-S1,&#xD;
      confirmed by imaging examinations (MR, TK), and the patients' lack of use of non-steroid&#xD;
      anti-inflammatory medications (NSAID) for a period of at least one week before the start of&#xD;
      the tests. People with cancer, past spinal injuries with damage to anatomical structures and&#xD;
      osteoporosis were excluded from the tests. Patients who did not qualify also included those&#xD;
      with a severe inflammatory condition (sciatica) and a massive hernia of the intervertebral&#xD;
      disc which required surgical treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients were randomly divided into four groups of 50 people: the manual therapy group&#xD;
      (A), the PNF method group (B), the manual therapy and the PNF method group (C), as well as&#xD;
      the traditional kinesiotherapy group (D).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The analgesic effectiveness of the used treatment was evaluated by means of the commonly used&#xD;
      10-point visual analogue scale of pain (VAS), the modified Laitinen questionnaire of pain&#xD;
      indicators and Stratford's back pain functional scale (BPFS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The functional evaluation involved a goniometric examination of active movements in the&#xD;
      thoracic-lumbar spine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measurements of pain intensity using visual analogue pain scale (VAS) and a modified&#xD;
      Laitinen's pain questionnaire were carried out four times (before the start of the therapy,&#xD;
      in the middle of it, immediately after its completion and two weeks after the end of the&#xD;
      treatment). The clinical examination (goniometric measurements of range of motion of the&#xD;
      spine) and the evaluation of nerve root irritation (Laseque's and Mackiewicz's signs) was&#xD;
      done twice - before and immediately after the treatment. At the same time the functional&#xD;
      ability in patients in everyday activities using the Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) and Back&#xD;
      Pain Functional Scale (BPFS) was evaluated too.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A statistical analysis of the obtained results was performed by means of the SPSS 17.0 suite&#xD;
      (Softonic, USA). Qualitative variables were described by stating the number of observations&#xD;
      with the feature variant (n) and its corresponding percentage. The qualitative-nominal data&#xD;
      was calculated using the following dependence coefficients based on the Chi-squared test:&#xD;
      Phi, Cram√©r's V, and for variables in ordinal scales: Kendall's Tau-b and Tau-c.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Quantitative variables were described based on their nonparametric distribution (verified by&#xD;
      the Shapiro-Wilk and Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests) by providing descriptive characteristics: the&#xD;
      mean, the median and the standard deviation. In order to compare differences between&#xD;
      analogical parameters, the following nonparametric tests were used: Mann-Whitney U for two&#xD;
      samples, Kruskal-Wallis for more than two samples. In the case of comparisons of equinumerous&#xD;
      groups, a parametric test was used: a one-way analysis of variance ANOVA and post hoc&#xD;
      comparisons.&#xD;
