      This study evaluates the effect of sotatercept (ACE-011) in adults with Pulmonary Arterial&#xD;
      Hypertension. Each eligible participant will receive standard of care (SOC) plus sotatercept&#xD;
      (ACE-011) for a 24 week treatment period, followed by an 18 month Extension Period and an 8&#xD;
      week follow up period.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 2a, single arm, open-label, multi center exploratory study to determine the&#xD;
      effects of sotatercept (ACE-011) plus standard of care (SOC) in adults with WHO functional&#xD;
      class III pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH).&#xD;
&#xD;
      All eligible participants will receive standard of care (SOC) plus sotatercept (ACE-011) at a&#xD;
      starting dose level of 0.3 mg/kg SC for Cycle 1 and escalating to 0.7 mg/kg at cycle 2 for&#xD;
      the remainder of the treatment period. Participants will be required to attend clinic visits&#xD;
      once every three weeks for the 24 week Treatment Period and once every three weeks for the 18&#xD;
      month Extension Period to perform one or more protocol specified evaluations. Evaluations&#xD;
      include hemodynamic measures collected during right heart catheterization (RHC) with invasive&#xD;
      cardiopulmonary exercise test (iCPET), and cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MR), 6-minute&#xD;
      walk distance (6MWD), pharmacokinetic parameters, pharmacodynamic parameters, anti-drug&#xD;
      antibody testing, and adverse events.&#xD;
