      Background/aim: Investigators aimed to investigate the effect of D vitamin levels on&#xD;
      Sugammadex and Neostigmine reverse durations in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Materials and methods: Eighty patients between 18 and 65 years, with ASA I-III status who&#xD;
      were undergoing surgery under general anaesthesia were included the study. All patients were&#xD;
      randomly divided into two groups with double blindness and 1.25 (OH) 2 vitamin D, 25 (OH) 2&#xD;
      vitamin D, and calcium levels were measured. At the end of the operation, 2 mg/kg of&#xD;
      Sugammadex was administered to one group and Atropine + Neostigmine to the other group. The&#xD;
      patients were also divided into two groups as to whether their vitamin D levels were â‰¥ 30&#xD;
      ng/mL or below.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A train of four values was recorded after a hypnotic agent was given at the beginning and&#xD;
      throughout the operation. The time to complete the disappearance of response to TOF&#xD;
      stimulation was recorded as T0.&#xD;
&#xD;
      End of the operation: When 2 responses to TOF stimulation were taken, the following times&#xD;
      were recorded until the extubation phase by administering at least 2 mg/kg of Sugammadex or&#xD;
      0.05 mg/kg of Neostigmine 0.05 mg/kg of Atropine per kg of body weight. The time until the&#xD;
      TOF value reached 50,70,90% and extubation were recorded.&#xD;

      Prospective observational study was carried out in the same centre after the approval of the&#xD;
      University Hospital by the ethical committee of non-invasive research (Duzce University,&#xD;
      School of Medicine, Ethics Committee of Non-invasive clinical research approval for&#xD;
      application Date: 11.10.2013, Decision Number: 2013/439) and done by Anaesthesiology&#xD;
      Department in the same centre. This research was also funded by our University Scientific&#xD;
      Research Project Coordinating Department (2014.04.02.221).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eighty-four patients with ASA I-III status, undergoing surgery under general anaesthesia&#xD;
      between the ages of 18 and 65 years were included the study. Twenty millilitre blood samples&#xD;
      were taken from the antecubital ven before the operation, after taken the approval of all&#xD;
      patients. 1.25 (OH) 2 vitamin D, 25 (OH) 2 vitamin D, calcium, magnesium, phosphorus and&#xD;
      parathormone levels were measured in the blood samples. All patients were randomly divided&#xD;
      into two groups with double blindness. At the end of the operation, a 2 mg/kg dose of&#xD;
      Sugammadex (Group Sugammadex n = 40) and 0.55 mg/kg + 0.015 mg/kg atropine Neostigmine (to&#xD;
      the other group) were administered intravenously. The patients were also divided into two&#xD;
      groups, having vitamin D levels above 30 ng/mL and below 30 ng/mL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients were connected to a kinemyograph, which placed the neuromuscular transmission&#xD;
      (NMT) module (GE Health Care) on the patients' adductor pollicis muscle before the&#xD;
      anaesthesia induction. Patients body temperature were monitored and maintained within 35-37 0&#xD;
      C. Subsequently, the hypnotic agent was given at the beginning of the operation and Train of&#xD;
      Four (TOF) values were recorded as % values throughout the operation. All patients received 2&#xD;
      mg of Midazolam intravenously for premedication. All patients were monitored by standard&#xD;
      monitoring and received 2 mg / kg Propofol and 1 mcg/kg Fentanyl. Train of Four (TOF)&#xD;
      stimulation started at 1 Hz intervals at a frequency of 2 Hz in 1-minute intervals. The&#xD;
      initial values determined were recorded as the baseline TOF values and 0.5 mg / kg Rocuronium&#xD;
      (Esmeron amp, Organon, Holland) was administered intravenously, which was calculated on ideal&#xD;
      body weight. The time to complete disappearance of response to TOF stimulation was recorded&#xD;
      as T0 and endotracheal intubation was performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anaesthetic maintenance was proven by 50% oxygen + 50% air + 2% volume Sevoflurane via&#xD;
      endotracheal tube. Remifentanil was administered intravenously at 0.05-1 mcgr /kg /h. When a&#xD;
      2-point response to TOF was received, the muscle relaxant was administered in repeated doses&#xD;
      as 10 mg of Rocuronium.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The total muscle relaxant quantities were recorded. At the end of the operation: when 2&#xD;
      responses to TOF stimulation were taken, the following times were recorded until the&#xD;
      extubation phase by administering at least 2 mg/kg of Sugammadex (Bridion flk, Merck Sharp &amp;&#xD;
      Dohme) or 0.05 mg/kg of Neostigmine (Neostigmin amp, Adeka, Turkey) and 0.05 mg/kg of&#xD;
      Atropine per kg body weight.&#xD;
&#xD;
      T0.5: The time until the TOF value reached 50% T0.7: The time until the TOF value reached 70%&#xD;
      T0.9: The time until the TOF value reached 90% Teks: Time to extubation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients, who were able to open their eyes with spontaneous breathing, had a tidal volume of&#xD;
      10 ml/kg, according to ideal body weight during spontaneous breathing, pulse oximetry values&#xD;
      above 95%, headache for 5 seconds, and TOF values above 90%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators used the independent samples t-test for two variables, continuous variables for&#xD;
      comparison, and the Pearson Chi-square test for categorical variables. Repeated measures&#xD;
      ANOVA was used to examine the interaction between drug groups and TOF measurement time.&#xD;
      Co-effects of drug groups and vitamin D subgroups were examined by two-way analysis of&#xD;
      variance (ANOVA). Repeated measures ANOVA, one of the three-factor differentials, were used&#xD;
      to examine the TOF measurement time interaction of drug effects and vitamin D subgroups'&#xD;
      concerted effects. Statistical analyses were performed with the SPSS v.22 packet program and&#xD;
      the significance level was taken as 0.05.&#xD;
