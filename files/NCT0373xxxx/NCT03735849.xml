    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the safety and pharmacokinetics of a human monoclonal antibody&#xD;
      (VRC07-523LS) in the sera and mucosae of healthy, HIV-uninfected adults.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be randomly assigned to one of two groups. Participants in Group 1 will&#xD;
      receive 10 mg/kg of VRC07-523LS at Weeks 0, 16, and 32. Participants in Group 2 will receive&#xD;
      30 mg/kg of VRC07-523LS at Weeks 0, 16, and 32.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study visits will occur at Weeks 0, 2, 16, 18, 32, 34, and 48. Visits may include physical&#xD;
      examinations; blood and urine collection; rectal, cervicovaginal, and seminal secretion&#xD;
      collection; cervical, rectal, and vaginal biopsy collection; HIV testing; risk reduction&#xD;
      counseling; and questionnaires. Study staff will contact participants at Week 50 for&#xD;
      follow-up safety monitoring.&#xD;

                  less than or equal to 150 mm Hg systolic and less than or equal to 100 mm Hg&#xD;
                  diastolic. For these volunteers, blood pressure must be less than or equal to 140&#xD;
                  mm Hg systolic and less than or equal to 90 mm Hg diastolic at enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  If a person has NOT been found to have elevated blood pressure or hypertension&#xD;
                  during screening or previously, exclude for systolic blood pressure greater than&#xD;
                  or equal to 150 mm Hg at enrollment or diastolic blood pressure greater than or&#xD;
                  equal to 100 mm Hg at enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Malignancy (Not excluded from participation: Volunteer who has had malignancy excised&#xD;
             surgically and who, in the investigator's estimation, has a reasonable assurance of&#xD;
             sustained cure, or who is unlikely to experience recurrence of malignancy during the&#xD;
             period of the study)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Seizure disorder: History of seizure(s) within past three years. Also exclude if&#xD;
             volunteer has used medications in order to prevent or treat seizure(s) at any time&#xD;
             within the past 3 years&#xD;

             of the colorectal area (eg, an HSV-2 outbreak or inflamed hemorrhoids or&#xD;
             colitis/diarrhea), internal hemorrhoids, or any other condition noted during screening&#xD;
             rectal exam via anoscope or in medical history that in the opinion of the clinician&#xD;
             represents a contraindication to mucosal sampling.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  For those who were assigned female sex at birth (for vaginal and cervical biopsies),&#xD;
             any condition noted during pelvic exam via speculum or in medical history that in the&#xD;
             opinion of the clinician represents a contraindication to mucosal sampling (eg,&#xD;
             bacterial vaginosis).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  An active genital tract condition, such as an active infection or inflammation of the&#xD;
             genital tract (eg, genital sores or ulcers, penile or abnormal vaginal discharge,&#xD;
             genital warts that are symptomatic or requiring treatment) or any other condition that&#xD;
             in the opinion of the clinician represents a contraindication to mucosal sampling.&#xD;
