  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to examine the effects of rapamycin (sirolimus) versus a&#xD;
      placebo, an inactive substance, on responses to alcohol cues in individuals with alcohol use&#xD;
      disorder. Rapamycin (sirolimus) is a FDA-approved antibiotic and immunosuppressive drug that&#xD;
      is currently used to (a) prevent organ transplant recipients from rejecting their transplants&#xD;
      (b) treat cardiovascular diseases, and (c) treat some forms of cancer. Rapamycin (sirolimus)&#xD;
      is not FDA-approved to treat alcohol use disorder. The use of rapamycin (sirolimus) in this&#xD;
      study is investigational, meaning that the study medication is not a proven treatment for&#xD;
      alcohol use disorder. The study will examine the medication's use as a potential treatment&#xD;
      for alcohol use disorder, as well as how safe and tolerable it is to take.&#xD;

    <description>Participants will be given a timeline to record any drinking that occurs between visits 2 and 3.&#xD;
Time line follow back procedures were used to record daily drinking behavior for all study days; recorded as standard drinks. The total number of days where drinking was recorded is summed for each participants during the study window.</description>
