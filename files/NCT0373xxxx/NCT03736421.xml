  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall goal of this multicenter project is to characterize the expected normal range of&#xD;
      Peripheral IntraVenous Volume Analysis (PIVA) values during a euvolemic state, and how those&#xD;
      ranges may be altered by comorbidities; the relationship between PIVA and intravenous volume&#xD;
      administration during resuscitation of infected patients with presumed hypovolemia; and, the&#xD;
      relationship between PIVA and volume decreases during diuresis in acute heart failure&#xD;
      patients with hypervolemia.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The determination of volume status remains a clinical challenge in medicine. Patients may&#xD;
      develop hypovolemia (too little fluids in the vascular space) due to conditions such as&#xD;
      hemorrhage, dehydration, or infection with vascular leak. Alternatively, patients may become&#xD;
      hypervolemic (too much fluids in the vascular space), due to conditions such as heart&#xD;
      failure, renal failure, or iatragenic over-resuscitation all of which overwhelm the kidney's&#xD;
      ability to regulate intravascular volume status. In clinical practice, clinicians strive to&#xD;
      return patients to euvolemia (the &quot;right&quot; volume status) through the administration of&#xD;
      intravenous fluids or diuretics which remove fluids to achieve homeostasis. While there are a&#xD;
      number of proposed clinical exam findings (e.g. dry mucous membranes or skin turgor),&#xD;
      measurements (e.g. central venous pressure), or laboratory tests (e.g. blood urea nitrogen),&#xD;
      none are precise or universally accepted as reliable methodologies to assess volume status.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goal of this study is to perform a prospective observational study on three distinct&#xD;
      cohorts during ED presentation to assess the variability and performance of PIVA in tracking&#xD;
      volume status.&#xD;
