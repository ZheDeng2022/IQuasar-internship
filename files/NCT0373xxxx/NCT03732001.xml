      Evaluate the efficacy and safety of Anlotinib in combination with Docetaxel versus Docetaxel&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Anlotinib is a multi-target receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor in domestic research and&#xD;
      development. It can inhibit the angiogenesis related kinase, such as VEGFR, FGFR, PDGFR, and&#xD;
      tumor cell proliferation related kinase -c-Kit kinase. In the phase Ⅲ study, patients who&#xD;
      failed at least two kinds of systemic chemotherapy (third line or beyond) or drug intolerance&#xD;
      were treated with anlotinib（12mg，po. qd. on day 1to14 of a 21-day cycle） or placebo, the&#xD;
      anlotinib group PFS and OS were 5.37 months and 9.63 months, the placebo group PFS and OS&#xD;
      were 1.4 months and 6.3 months. Therefore, the investigators envisage using anlotinib plus&#xD;
      docetaxel treat the advanced Non-small cell lung cancer patients who were failure of&#xD;
      first-line Chemotherapy , to further improve the patient's PFS.&#xD;
