  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Alzheimer's disease (AD) and other forms of dementia are rapidly increasing with the aging of&#xD;
      the population, and show a clear preponderance among people with insulin resistance.&#xD;
      Metformin, an insulin sensitizer, is being examined in clinical trials as an anti-aging drug.&#xD;
      However, very little objective data is available regarding metformin's effect on the brain, a&#xD;
      major organ affected by aging.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Insulin resistance is highly prevalent with advancing age. Metformin is an insulin sensitizer&#xD;
      and is currently being extensively investigated for its potential anti-aging effect. However,&#xD;
      only very limited information is available on metformin effect on brain, which is a major&#xD;
      organ affected by aging. With appropriate experimental design, the investigators are&#xD;
      attempting to understand the mechanism of metformin treatment on the physiology of the brain&#xD;
      as well as cognitive effects. These studies may uncover relationships that could be favorably&#xD;
      manipulated to decrease health risks associated with insulin sensitivity and the effect on&#xD;
      the brain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study results may lead to a breakthrough in providing either definitive data or&#xD;
      sufficiently strong preliminary data regarding metformin's effect on elderly people with&#xD;
      insulin resistance, on whether the drug enhances brain mitochondrial function in conjunction&#xD;
      with improvement of brain functional network and cognitive function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The overall hypothesis is that metformin administration to elderly people with insulin&#xD;
      resistance enhances brain mitochondrial function in conjunction with improvement of brain&#xD;
      function. To test this hypothesis, the investigators will address the following Specific&#xD;
      Aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Determine whether 40 weeks of metformin administration in elderly people (&gt; 65 years)&#xD;
           with insulin resistance enhances brain mitochondrial ATP production. The investigators&#xD;
           will measure brain ATP production by 31P-MRS.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Determine the effect of 40 weeks of metformin administration in elderly people (&gt; 65&#xD;
           years) with insulin resistance on blood flow and functional network in different areas&#xD;
           of brain. As a secondary outcome, the investigators will measure structural changes in&#xD;
           white and grey matter areas of brain to determine whether metformin has any effect on&#xD;
           brain structure.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Determine the effect of 40 weeks of metformin administration in elderly people (&gt; 65&#xD;
           years) with insulin resistance on cognitive function. The investigators will utilize the&#xD;
           computerized NIH Toolbox to measure cognitive outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will also associate outcomes from our specific aims with improvements in&#xD;
      whole-body insulin sensitivity and skeletal muscle mitochondrial function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators propose to complete 40 weeks of study in 40 elderly (&gt; 65 years)&#xD;
      participants with fasting glucose between 100 to 140 mg/dl and abdominal girth of &gt;102 cm in&#xD;
      men and &gt; 88 cm in women. All participants will be those who are not oral hypoglycemic agents&#xD;
      including metformin. In this double-blind placebo trial, the investigators will randomly&#xD;
      assign the participants to placebo or metformin in an escalated dose to reach a maximum of&#xD;
      2500 mg per day.&#xD;
