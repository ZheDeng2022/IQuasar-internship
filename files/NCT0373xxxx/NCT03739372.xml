  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a 2 strata pilot trial within the Pacific Pediatric Neuro-Oncology Consortium (PNOC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will use a new treatment approach based on each patient's tumor gene expression,&#xD;
      whole-exome sequencing (WES), targeted panel profile (UCSF 500 gene panel), and RNA-Seq. The&#xD;
      current study will test the efficacy of such an approach in children with High-grade gliomas&#xD;
      HGG.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      For children with High-grade gliomas (HGG) including HGG presenting within the midline&#xD;
      structures of the brain and spine, outcome remains poor and the majority of children die from&#xD;
      this disease. The current study will use a new treatment approach based on each patient's&#xD;
      tumor gene expression, whole-exome sequencing (WES), targeted panel profile (UCSF 500 gene&#xD;
      panel), and RNA-Seq. This treatment strategy has shown promising results in adult patients&#xD;
      with solid tumors and is currently being explored in children with DIPG, neuroblastoma and&#xD;
      other solid tumors. The current study will test the efficacy of such an approach in children&#xD;
      with HGG for which outcomes remain dismal.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with newly diagnosed HGG (including midline HGG but excluding DIPG), who&#xD;
             undergo tissue collection as part of standard of care. HGG is defined as either World&#xD;
             Health Organization (WHO) grade III or IV, or testing positive for H3K27M mutation.&#xD;
             Patients with disseminated disease are not eligible, and MRI of the spine must be&#xD;
             performed if disseminated disease is suspected by the treating physician. Primary&#xD;
             spinal cord tumors are eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Enrollment within 3 weeks of the start of radiation therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Start of radiation therapy within 6 weeks from initial tissue diagnosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age ≤ 21 years&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Karnofsky score ≥ 50 for patients ≥ 16 years of age and Lansky score ≥ 50 for patients&#xD;
             ≤15 years of age. Patients who are unable to walk because of paralysis but who are up&#xD;
             in a wheelchair, will be considered ambulatory for the purpose of assessing the&#xD;
             performance score&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Adequate tissue for molecular profiling (see Section 8 of the protocol for full&#xD;
             details)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The effects of the current treatment paradigm on the developing human fetus are&#xD;
             unknown. For this reason, females of child-bearing potential and males must agree to&#xD;
             use adequate contraception: hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence&#xD;
             prior to study entry and for the duration of study participation, and 30 days after&#xD;
             completion of study drug administration. Should a female become pregnant or suspect&#xD;
             she is pregnant while she or her partner is participating in this study, she should&#xD;
             inform her treating physician immediately. Males treated or enrolled on this protocol&#xD;
             must also agree to use adequate contraception prior to the study, for the duration of&#xD;
             study participation, and 30 days after completion of study drug administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Adequate neurologic function defined as: Patients with seizure disorder may be&#xD;
             enrolled if seizures are well controlled.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ability by patient or parent/legal guardian to understand a written informed consent&#xD;
             document, and the willingness to sign it.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who are currently enrolled on another therapeutic clinical trial. Individual&#xD;
             cases should be discussed with the study chair.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who are currently taking any anti-cancer directed therapy. Steroids are not&#xD;
             considered anti-cancer therapy. The use of temozolomide during radiation therapy is&#xD;
             allowed at standard dosing (maximum 75 to 90 mg/m^2 daily for a total of 42 days). Any&#xD;
             other schedule(s) need to be discussed with the study chair.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active&#xD;
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac&#xD;
             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with&#xD;
             study requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Female patients of childbearing potential must not be pregnant or breast-feeding.&#xD;
             Female patients of childbearing potential must have a negative serum or urine&#xD;
             pregnancy test prior to the start of therapy (as clinically indicated).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with inability to return for follow-up visits or obtain follow-up studies&#xD;
             required to assess toxicity to therapy. Telemedicine visits are acceptable.&#xD;
