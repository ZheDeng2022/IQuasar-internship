      Introduction: The prevalence of asthma and exercise-induced bronchoconstriction is high in&#xD;
      the athletic population. In endurance sport, the prevalence has been reported to be as high&#xD;
      as 30-50% compared to the general population prevalence of approximately 5-10% in Western&#xD;
      countries. First-line treatment in asthma is reliever medication and inhaled corticosteroids&#xD;
      (ICS). Therefore, β2-adrenoceptor agonists and ICS are commonly prescribed drugs to athletes.&#xD;
      Although long-acting β2-agonists (LABA) are the most commonly used β2-agonists in asthma&#xD;
      management, development of ultra-long acting β2-agonists (U-LABA) as vilanterol may change&#xD;
      this. U-LABA has a long duration of action (24 hours) compared with LABA (12 hours). The&#xD;
      accumulated number of inhalations per day for elite athletes may thus be reduced when&#xD;
      prescribed with U-LABA as compared to LABA. Use of β2-agonists are restricted by the World&#xD;
      Anti-Doping Agency (WADA). As of 2018, β2-agonists salbutamol, formoterol and salmeterol are&#xD;
      allowed by inhalation in therapeutic doses, whereas other β2-agonists, such as terbutaline&#xD;
      and vilanterol still require the athlete to obtain a therapeutic use exemption (TUE). To&#xD;
      discriminate therapeutic use from supra-therapeutic misuse, WADA has established urinary&#xD;
      thresholds and decision limits based on urine concentrations of salbutamol, salmeterol and&#xD;
      formoterol. However, while data on urine concentrations of these three β2-agonists are&#xD;
      well-described in studies that simulate sport-specific situations that are applicable for&#xD;
      doping control, no such data exist for the novel U-LABA vilanterol. For instance, asthmatic&#xD;
      athletes using β2-agonists usually inhale the drug before training or competition as&#xD;
      prophylaxis for bronchoconstriction. Thus, studies are needed to investigate the urine&#xD;
      concentrations of vilanterol after inhaled administration in set-ups that are applicable to&#xD;
      doping control which this study aims to investigate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Method: The study is divided in two phases. The first phase consists of a pharmacokinetic&#xD;
      pilot trial (EXP1). Depending on the analytical outcome of the pilot study, the study&#xD;
      proceeds into the second phase, which is a larger pharmacokinetic trial (EXP2). Both EXP1 and&#xD;
      EXP 2 are open label studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXP1: 6 healthy, well trained individuals are recruited to perform two trial days. First&#xD;
      trial day consists of inhalation of the study drug in 4 times therapeutic dose followed by an&#xD;
      exercise session. Before second trial day subjects inhales 4 times the therapeutic dose at&#xD;
      home and on day 7 perform a training session. Urine and blood are collected in the following&#xD;
      72 hours both days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXP2: 20 healthy, well trained individuals are recruited to perform four trial days in the&#xD;
      same way as EXP1. But here both normal use and four times normal dose is investigated.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES The main objective of the present study is to investigate urine concentrations of&#xD;
      vilanterol and its metabolites (GSK932009 and GW630200) after single dose inhalation of&#xD;
      Relvar® (22/184 mcg VI/FF) at therapeutic and supratherapeutic doses. A secondary objective&#xD;
      is to investigate whether vilanterol and its metabolites (GSK932009 and GW630200) are present&#xD;
      at higher concentrations in urine after seven days of daily inhalation of Relvar® at&#xD;
      therapeutic and supratherapeutic doses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Applicability The results from the study will help establish a urine threshold and decision&#xD;
      limit for vilanterol on the WADA list of prohibited substances, thus lessening the&#xD;
      administrative burdens associated with TUEs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study drug Study treatment in this study is refers to either therapeutic dosage of 22/184&#xD;
      micrograms of vilanterol/fluticasone furoate or four times therapeutic dosage of&#xD;
      vilanterol/fluticasone furoate (88/736 micrograms, 4 puffs).&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODS Study design The study is divided in two phases. The first phase consists of a&#xD;
      pharmacokinetic pilot trial (EXP1). Depending on the analytical outcome of the pilot study,&#xD;
      the study proceeds into the second phase which is a larger pharmacokinetic trial (EXP2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Progression from the pilot phase (EXP1) of the study to the second phase (EXP2) of the study&#xD;
      depends on a successful pilot phase (EXP1). Success will be concluded provided the pilot&#xD;
      phase generates adequate urine concentration data for vilanterol and/or its metabolites&#xD;
      (GSK932009, GW630200) with values above the assay limits of quantitation for at least 8 hours&#xD;
      post dose. The pilot phase urine concentration data, together with plasma concentration data,&#xD;
      will also be used to estimate the urinary concentrations of vilanterol and/or its metabolites&#xD;
      at therapeutic and supratherapeutic under various conditions. These estimates will be used to&#xD;
      determine whether progression to the second phase of the study is feasible and has a high&#xD;
      probability of success in achieving its objectives.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Type of study The study is an open-label study. The study is classified as a Phase II study&#xD;
      investigating pharmacokinetics Screening In EXP1 and EXP2, subjects are examined by a medical&#xD;
      doctor and electrocardiography (ECG) is performed. Furthermore, subjects' lung function is&#xD;
      measured with a spirometer and maximal oxygen consumption (VO2max) and performance are&#xD;
      determined during an incremental bike ergometer test to exhaustion. Prior to the test,&#xD;
      subjects warm up for 15 min. Subjects are told to keep a cadence of 80-100 rpm during the&#xD;
      test. During the warm-up and incremental test, gas exchange is measured breath-by-breath.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the VO2max-test, inhaler technique is practiced with a demonstrator device.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pharmacokinetic trials&#xD;
&#xD;
      In EXP1, subjects meet at the laboratory for two trials:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Trial A1: Supra-therapeutic inhalation of Relvar® 22/184 (4 puffs) once Trial A2:&#xD;
      Supra-therapeutic inhalation of Relvar® 22/184 (4 puffs) daily for 7 days&#xD;
&#xD;
      In EXP2, subjects meet at the laboratory for four trials:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Trial A1: Supra-therapeutic inhalation of Relvar® 22/184 (4 puffs) once Trial A2:&#xD;
      Supra-therapeutic inhalation of Relvar® 22/184 (4 puffs) daily for 7 days Trial B1:&#xD;
      Therapeutic inhalation of Relvar® 22/184 (1 puff) once Trial B2: Therapeutic inhalation of&#xD;
      Relvar® 22/184 (1 puff) daily for 7 days&#xD;
&#xD;
      During each of the trials, subjects meet in the morning after an overnight fast. A urine&#xD;
      sample is collected and subjects ingest a standardized meal and drink. One hour after the&#xD;
      meal, study drug is administered during supervision and subjects start performing 60 min of&#xD;
      exercise on a bike ergometer. Exercise is based on subjects' individual VO2max. To simulate&#xD;
      the shifts in intensity during real-life competitive stages, the exercise protocol is&#xD;
      performed at various shifting intensities, but still at a relative load of subjects' VO2max&#xD;
      for inter-individual comparisons. Subjects are allowed to drink water during the exercise.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After exercise, subjects remain inactive for the rest of the trial. Three hours after&#xD;
      administration of the study drug, subjects receive a standardized lunch and drink.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Urine is collected 0-1, 1-2, 2-4, 4-6, 6-8, 8-12, 12-16, 16-24, 24-36, 36-48 and 48-72 h&#xD;
      following administration (corresponding to 0-71 h post exercise).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Venous blood samples are collected through a catheter in the antecubital vein ½, 1½, 3, 5, 7&#xD;
      and 10 h following administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Detailed instructions for urine and blood sample collection, processing, storage and&#xD;
      transportation will be provided in the Study Procedures Manual) Concerning the Pilot study&#xD;
      (EXP1) and the main study (EXP2): Between trials 1 and 2, subjects receive a Relvar® inhaler&#xD;
      for six days of home use of 4 puffs per day, which will be monitored by staff via Skype or&#xD;
      Facetime video call at the same time of the day as during trial 1. Twenty-four hours after&#xD;
      the sixth day of home inhalation, subjects meet for trial 2. In EXP1 Trial A1 and Trial A2 is&#xD;
      separated with minimum one week to ensure washout. In EXP2, Trial A1 and A2 and B1 and B2 are&#xD;
      separated by at least 1 week to ensure washout.&#xD;
&#xD;
      End of trial The trial is finished when the last patient has been at the last visit. Pilot&#xD;
      study (EXP1) is estimated to end at the end of 2018 and the large study is estimated to end&#xD;
      at the end of 2019.&#xD;
