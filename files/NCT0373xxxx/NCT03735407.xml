      Overall Design: Up to 45 healthy subjects will participate in this study. Subjects to be&#xD;
      enrolled in this study are indicated and scheduled to undergo optical colonoscopy based on&#xD;
      the following symptoms or by being classified as higher than average risk based on one or&#xD;
      more of the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Surveillance - Significant findings in previous optical colonoscopy&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Diagnostic - Polyps detected in virtual colonoscopy referred for polypectomy&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Diagnostic - Polyps detected in previous optical colonoscopy (community setting)&#xD;
           referred for polypectomy&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Diagnostic - Positive FIT (Fecal Immunochemical Test)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Diagnostic - one or more of the typical symptoms:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  abdominal pain&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Change in bowel habits&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Anemia or overt bleeding in stool&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Significant weight loss&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  First degree relatives of CRC (Colo-Rectal Cancer)subjects Alternatively, average risk&#xD;
           based on their age and demographics referred for screening for polyps&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each subject will receive a comprehensive explanation regarding the study nature. During this&#xD;
      process, and per ethical committee approval, subjects may be asked several questions (over&#xD;
      the phone) regarding their medical background for preliminary assessment of eligibility. Once&#xD;
      informed consent is obtained, a thorough evaluation of subject's eligibility will be&#xD;
      performed based on inclusion / exclusion criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible subjects will be required to undergo FIT procedure, per package insert instructions,&#xD;
      within pre-defined timelines. All subjects will be scheduled to undergo capsule procedure, to&#xD;
      be followed later on with optical colonoscopy procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One to three days following end of C-Scan procedure the subjects will be contacted by phone&#xD;
      by the clinical coordinator to follow-up on the subject well-being. Same follow-up procedures&#xD;
      will be applied one to three days following Optical Colonoscopy procedure. Medical history&#xD;
      and concomitant medication information will be collected for all subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Duration: The duration of study participation for each subject is expected to be&#xD;
      approximately 8-10 weeks. The total study duration across all patients is expected to be&#xD;
      approximately 6 months, dependent upon subject recruitment rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      C-Scan Procedure: Subjects will be instructed to skip breakfast or lunch on the day of C-Scan&#xD;
      Capsule ingestion to expedite gastric passage. Liquids are allowed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The subjects will be connected to the C-Scan Track and after successful system's activation&#xD;
      (BIT - built in test), the subject will be asked to ingest the C-Scan Capsule with some&#xD;
      water, contrast media (GE Omnipaque 350) and non-soluble fiber, in the presence of a&#xD;
      physician investigator or designee. The subject will also be provided with an RF watch. A&#xD;
      representative of the sponsor will attend the ingestion procedure, as needed to assure proper&#xD;
      activation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post ingestion, the subject will receive detailed instructions about the daily routine and&#xD;
      activities as well as use of the RF watch and then will be discharged home with written&#xD;
      instructions on the procedure Instructions for use (IFU), daily diary, FIT kit and capsule&#xD;
      return kit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      FIT Procedure: All subjects will be required to perform FIT procedure using [OC-Light] FIT&#xD;
      Kit prior or during the capsule procedure Capsule Return: Capsule procedure is completed upon&#xD;
      capsule excretion or system auditory indication of 'End of Procedure'. Subjects will be&#xD;
      instructed to inform the study coordinator or designee upon capsule excretion&#xD;
