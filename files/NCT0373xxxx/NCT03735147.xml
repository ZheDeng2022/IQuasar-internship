  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      LAIV shedding studies in children could be an important way to confirm whether impediments to&#xD;
      viral replication do indeed explain these observed reductions in vaccine effectiveness (VE),&#xD;
      whether prior vaccination has any influence on replication and what future implications (if&#xD;
      any) this might have for the UK paediatric LAIV programme. LAIV virus replication in children&#xD;
      will be dependent on virological and host factors. The virus factors include replicative&#xD;
      fitness of individual strains and the susceptibility to inhibition by other replicating&#xD;
      strains (ability to compete). Host factors which may influence this include pre-existing&#xD;
      specific immunity as a result of prior infection or previous vaccination (with either LAIV or&#xD;
      IIV), and innate immune factors including mucosal immunity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is significant variability in shedding across viral subtypes in studies done to date,&#xD;
      so there is a need to obtain local data in a small pilot observational study which will look&#xD;
      in detail at virus shedding by sequential daily virus samples, something not possible on a&#xD;
      larger scale. The data generated will inform future LAIV studies in the UK in terms of&#xD;
      optimum time of sample collection for viral shedding studies, which are likely to be required&#xD;
      on a regular basis, to supplement field studies of vaccine effectiveness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will enrol up to 30 children that will allow these factors to be assessed. Both&#xD;
      written informed consent from parent/ guardian and written assent from the child will be in&#xD;
      place prior to any study procedure. All participants will have a baseline assessment of&#xD;
      pre--existing influenza immunity (blood test, oral fluid collection and nasal swabs),&#xD;
      followed by a single dose of LAIV. Parents will then be asked to take nasal swabs at home on&#xD;
      days 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, with further nasal swab, blood test and oral fluid collection in&#xD;
      hospital 4 weeks later, in order to assess for immune responses to LAIV.&#xD;
