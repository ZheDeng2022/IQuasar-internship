  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Lack of adherence to an exercise program is a major problem for older Veterans. Several fall&#xD;
      prevention programs fail in the home setting due to lack of adherence. Exercise adherence is&#xD;
      dependent on brain function among other factors. Magnetic stimulation of the front part of&#xD;
      the brain improves brain function necessary for planning and following-through. The&#xD;
      investigators propose a three-phase study in 106 sedentary older Veterans. Everyone will be&#xD;
      trained on use of the exergame, Nintendo Wii-Fit, that the investigators' team has found&#xD;
      beneficial in improving balance and gait. They will be asked to exercise using Wii-Fit at&#xD;
      home for 45 minutes daily five days/week for 12-weeks. Those that exercise less than&#xD;
      recommended dose and those that exercise adequately but have low executive function will&#xD;
      receive either real or sham magnetic stimulation to the front part of their brain over ten&#xD;
      sessions paired with exercise training. All subjects will further complete 24-weeks of&#xD;
      Wii-Fit home exercises. Adherence, executive function, balance and gait, self-efficacy, delay&#xD;
      discounting, and falls will be measured periodically.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Background: Fall-related hospitalizations and consequent morbidity and mortality continue to&#xD;
      rise despite the availability for over two decades of evidence-based fall-prevention&#xD;
      programs. This is a major problem since more than 2.5 million older adults are treated&#xD;
      annually for fall-related injuries in the US. Fall-prevention programs focusing on strength&#xD;
      and balance exercises have been successful in facility settings but exercise programs are&#xD;
      ineffective at home due to lack of adherence. Estimates indicate that only 1 in 5 individuals&#xD;
      adhere to home exercise programs for fall prevention. Thus, there is an urgent need to&#xD;
      improve adherence to exercise performed at home by older adults seeking to improve balance&#xD;
      for the sake of fall prevention. Behavioral interventions have failed to consistently improve&#xD;
      adherence to exercise. Biological reasons for poor exercise adherence, such as executive&#xD;
      dysfunction, have not been explored. Adherence to long-term exercise is dependent on&#xD;
      executive function (EF), which is controlled by the [dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC)]&#xD;
      of the brain. EF influences choices in scheduling, forgoing competing activities, enduring&#xD;
      subtle costs of time and inconvenience, and the ability to delay gratification. Repetitive&#xD;
      transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is a non-invasive neuromodulation increasingly used&#xD;
      for neural network specific interventions. rTMS of the DLPFC improves EF, memory, motivation,&#xD;
      and mental flexibility. rTMS studies to date have stimulated the motor cortex for gait and&#xD;
      balance improvements. The role of DLPFC in exercise adherence has not been explored. The&#xD;
      proposed study will be the first to test DLPFC stimulation for improving exercise adherence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: The study objective is to determine the effects of rTMS treatment of the&#xD;
      dorsolateral prefrontal cortex compared to sham on: [1. Short-term (2-wk) changes in&#xD;
      executive function;] 2. Long-term (24-wk) adherence to a home-based exercise program; 3.&#xD;
      Long-term (24-wk) changes in balance and gait; and [4. Short-term (2-wk) changes in&#xD;
      self-efficacy and delay discounting.]&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: Sedentary community-dwelling older Veterans (age 65 years, [N=106]) will participate&#xD;
      in a double-blind randomized sham-controlled three-phase study. The proposed study will use&#xD;
      Nintendo Wii-Fit exercises. Phase I will include two weeks of facility-based exercise for&#xD;
      safety assessment and learning the program, followed by 12 weeks of home-based exercises.&#xD;
      [Subjects with poor adherence and those with good adherence with low EF] will then be&#xD;
      randomized to rTMS or sham treatments. Phase II will include ten consecutive weekdays of rTMS&#xD;
      or sham treatment along with exercise training for subjects with poor adherence [and for&#xD;
      those with good adherence and low EF] and continuation of home-based exercises for those with&#xD;
      good adherence and EF. Phase III includes 24-weeks of a home-based exercise program. All&#xD;
      subjects will exercise for 45 minutes five days/week. [Objective measure of adherence&#xD;
      collected from Wii-Fit console and Conner's continuous performance test for EF will be the&#xD;
      primary outcome measures.] Balance and gait will be assessed. [Self-efficacy, delay&#xD;
      discounting along with fear of falls, and falls incidence will be assessed. Outcome measures&#xD;
      will be assessed at baseline, and at 14, 16, and 40 weeks.]&#xD;
&#xD;
      Significance: This project will have a major impact in improving adherence to an exercise&#xD;
      program and in turn, improve balance in sedentary community-dwelling older Veterans. At the&#xD;
      end of the proposed project, the investigators will gain knowledge about the efficacy of rTMS&#xD;
      in improving EF and exercise adherence. Knowledge gained about the adherence to home-based&#xD;
      exercises would be applicable to multiple conditions such as diabetes. Since Wii-Fit and rTMS&#xD;
      are readily available, translation of the study results to clinical practice would be&#xD;
      expeditious.&#xD;
