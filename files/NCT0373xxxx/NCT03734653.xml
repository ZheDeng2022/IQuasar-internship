      This is an open-labeled, single-arm, interventional pilot study. It is being done to&#xD;
      determine the feasibility of the administration of transdermal testosterone alternating with&#xD;
      enzalutamide, as well as the safety and efficacy.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary endpoint of this trial is to determine the feasibility of the administration of&#xD;
      transdermal testosterone alternating with enzalutamide. High dose testosterone has shown&#xD;
      activity in phase II studies of patients with castration resistant metastatic prostate&#xD;
      cancer; however, these studies have generally employed the intramuscular formulation. It has&#xD;
      been hypothesized that the transdermal formulation will show activity but will have less&#xD;
      potential for toxicity due to extremely high levels of circulating testosterone (i.e.&#xD;
      thrombotic events). In addition, this will allow for a steady state of elevated testosterone,&#xD;
      rather than the peaks and troughs seen with the IM approach.&#xD;
