      The UCB transplant is a type of stem cell transplant used to treat cancer of the blood or&#xD;
      lymph glands. The UCB transplant has advantages over other types of transplants such as ease&#xD;
      of obtaining the umbilical cord blood, absence of donor risks, reduced risks of contagious&#xD;
      infections, and the availability for immediate use. The UCB transplant is also associated&#xD;
      with a lower incidence of graft versus host disease, or GvHD (in GvHD, the transplanted graft&#xD;
      attacks the recipient organs).&#xD;

      However, UCB as a graft source for a bone marrow transplant has drawbacks related to the&#xD;
      limited cell dose available for transplant and defects in homing. Homing is the process of&#xD;
      UCB stem cell lodging in the bone marrow. If the homing is not efficient it could delay the&#xD;
      re-population of the stem cells (or engraftment), possibly lead to engraftment failure, and&#xD;
      delay the rebuilding of the immune system after transplant. This could, in turn, provide a&#xD;
      higher risk to infection after the UCB transplant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This research study is aimed at investigating the use of hyperbaric oxygen (HBO) therapy&#xD;
      prior to the UCB transplant to find out if it will improve the stem cell homing, and&#xD;
      subsequently, the engraftment. HBO therapy involves breathing 100% pure oxygen while in a&#xD;
      sealed chamber that has been pressurized at 2 ½ times the normal atmospheric pressure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is a specific hormone which tells stem cells in the bone marrow to make more red blood&#xD;
      cells. This hormone (called EPO) is increased when blood oxygen levels are low. When the EPO&#xD;
      is increased, it might impair the bone marrow homing process of your transplant. Therefore,&#xD;
      the researchers conducting this study hope to determine if providing 100% pure oxygen to you&#xD;
      prior to your UCB transplant will decrease this hormone, and in turn, improve the homing&#xD;
      process after your transplant.&#xD;
