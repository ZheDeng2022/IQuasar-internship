  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Developed from a piloted intervention and based on scientific evidence, About Us is an&#xD;
      innovative healthy relationships intervention that promotes positive adolescent romantic&#xD;
      relationships and use of condoms and highly effective contraceptives if having sex. The&#xD;
      program includes 10 lessons (2 that are between 30-45 minutes long 8 that are 50 minutes&#xD;
      long) that blend group-based activities with online activities implemented in a small group&#xD;
      format with students in grades 9 or 10 who have parental consent and provide assent to take&#xD;
      part. The program will be implemented in school-based health centers (SBHCs).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary research question:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Nine months following the end of the program, what is the impact of About Us relative to&#xD;
           the standard of care on:&#xD;
&#xD;
           1.1. Rates of vaginal or anal sex without condoms in the past three months?&#xD;
&#xD;
           Secondary research questions:&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Three and nine months following the end of the program, what is the impact of About Us&#xD;
           relative to the standard of care on:&#xD;
&#xD;
           2.1. Rates of abstinence from vaginal or anal sex in the past three months? 2.2.&#xD;
           Frequency of communicating without abuse? 2.3. Utilization of school-based health center&#xD;
           services? 2.4. Rates of behavioral willingness and attitudes toward birth control?&#xD;
&#xD;
           Exploratory research questions:&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Three and nine months following the end of the program, what is the impact of About Us&#xD;
           relative to the standard of care on:&#xD;
&#xD;
           3.1. The psychosocial variables stemming from the theoretical framework (e.g., attitudes&#xD;
           toward condom and contraceptive use, normative beliefs, perceived self-efficacy to use&#xD;
           condoms or have difficult conversations) and enumerated in the logic model.&#xD;
&#xD;
           3.2. Outcomes listed above within key sub-groups including those defined by sex&#xD;
           (male/female), race/ethnicity, and exposure to violence;&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Among those receiving About Us, how do effect sizes for the primary and secondary&#xD;
           behavioral outcomes vary by dosage?&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Students will be screened for eligibility through each school-based health center (SBHC) by&#xD;
      SBHC staff, and those participants meeting the screening eligibility requirements (previous&#xD;
      exposure to violence and/or previous or current involvement in a romantic relationship) will&#xD;
      be offered a parental consent form and informational packet. Consent forms will be available&#xD;
      in English and Spanish. Pending parental consent and youth assent, students will be&#xD;
      randomized into either the intervention or control group.&#xD;

    <description>Each program session includes an initial soap opera-like story to build interest and illustrate key concepts, 2-3 group-based activities with reflection, individual app-based work on tablets to allow for personalization of the content, and a group-based debrief to reflect on the day and reinforce key messages. The group-based content is delivered by trained facilitators from the participating school-based health centers. The app-based content is housed on a secure website and accessed through tablets with unique log-ins for each participant. Activities are completed individually during the session (e.g., completing a poll; watching and responding to a brief video). Several lessons include homework activities that encourage communication between students and a caring adult.</description>
