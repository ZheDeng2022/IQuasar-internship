    <textblock>
      Monetary incentive programs can reduce weight short-term; however, many studies have shown&#xD;
      weight regain when the incentive program ends. This relapse is unsurprising; it is&#xD;
      well-established that a specific behavior is extinguished when reinforcement for the behavior&#xD;
      is removed. It is unlikely, then, given the expense, that monetary incentive programs could&#xD;
      be implemented long-term for chronic diseases like obesity. Thus, programs are needed to&#xD;
      bridge the gap between the short-term effects of a monetary incentive program and long-term&#xD;
      effects at program end.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A program that could be effective at bridging this gap is thought training, namely, episodic&#xD;
      future thinking (EFT). EFT teaches individuals to think prospectively about future events as&#xD;
      if they are happening now. EFT can reduce delay discounting (DD) which is defined as&#xD;
      discounting larger rewards in the future for smaller rewards now (e.g. people with high DD&#xD;
      levels may place more value on eating an unhealthy food now vs. the future health benefits of&#xD;
      forgoing the food). It is suggested that EFT increases the value of the future reward and&#xD;
      helps individuals make choices with lasting benefits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Given the power of EFT to reduce DD, it is plausible that EFT training during an incentive&#xD;
      program could help shift one's thought processes towards the long-term consequences of&#xD;
      behavior, promoting behavioral change even after the incentive program ends. Thus, the&#xD;
      purpose of this study is to assess whether EFT promotes weight-loss in N=40 parent/child&#xD;
      dyads (BMI â‰¥ 25) after a monetary incentive program ends vs. a control thought training&#xD;
      program, Healthy Thinking (HT).&#xD;
&#xD;
      We hypothesize:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The EFT and HT group will both have a reduction in BMI for adults/percent over BMI for&#xD;
           children and weight from baseline during the monetary incentives program.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The EFT vs. HT group will have a greater reduction in BMI/percent over BMI and weight&#xD;
           from baseline during the monetary incentives program.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The EFT group will maintain the reduction in BMI/percent over BMI and weight from&#xD;
           baseline after the termination of the monetary incentives program.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The HT group will not maintain the reduction in BMI/percent over BMI and weight from&#xD;
           baseline after the termination of the monetary incentives program.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The EFT vs. HT group will have a reduction in DD over time.&#xD;

      The study program is organized into 20 sessions. There is a mix of group sessions, individual&#xD;
      family in-person sessions, and individual family phone sessions. Each session is outlined&#xD;
      below:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Session 1 will be an in-lab screening session to ensure participants are eligible to&#xD;
      participate. During this session, participants will have their height and weight measured and&#xD;
      complete surveys: Eating Disorders Examination Questionnaire (EDE) for parents, Kid's Eating&#xD;
      Disorders Survey (KEDS) for kids, Sociodemographic, and a clinical interview. Participants&#xD;
      will also be instructed to track their eating and physical activity in MyFitnessPal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Session 2 will be a group workshop. Families will learn the core components of the program in&#xD;
      presentations by the research staff. The workshop will also include activities to keep the&#xD;
      families engaged and a meal will be provided. If the participants attend the workshop,&#xD;
      successfully logged in MyFitnessPal, and still want to participate, they will be randomized&#xD;
      to a treatment group and scheduled for a baseline session.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Session 3 will be a baseline session. Participants will have their height, weight, and&#xD;
      delayed discounting (DD) measured to establish baseline data. Participants will also complete&#xD;
      baseline surveys including: Consideration of Future Consequences Scale (CFCS), Palatable&#xD;
      Eating Motives Scale (PEMS), Relative Reinforcing Value, and Living to 75 assessment.&#xD;
      Participants will also create their first EFT or HT cues.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For EFT cue generation, participants will talk about a specific future positive event where&#xD;
      they imagine themselves in vivid detail. To generate the cues, participants in the EFT group&#xD;
      will be given standardized instructions asking them to think about and list specific events&#xD;
      that they are looking forward to in the future (ex: parties, holidays). Participants will be&#xD;
      instructed to generate the EFT cue by describing their events, including a detailed&#xD;
      description of themselves at the specific event. After the participant has created their&#xD;
      cues, they will save their cue for later use in the intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To control for the timing and attention of the EFT cue, participants in the HT group will&#xD;
      generate cues that include specific nutrition statements that they feel will be of personal&#xD;
      benefit. To generate the cues, participants in the HT group will select from a list of&#xD;
      nutrition statements that they feel will be personally useful in making healthy&#xD;
      decisions.After the participant has created their cues, the participant will save their cue&#xD;
      for later use in the intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sessions 4-19 will be intervention sessions split into 2 phases:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 1:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sessions 4-11 will be in person sessions between an individual family and a researcher.&#xD;
      Participants will have weight measured, do the thought training program, and talk to staff&#xD;
      about progress in the program. Phase 1 is when the monetary incentives program will be&#xD;
      implemented.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 2:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sessions 12-19 will be phone sessions between an individual family and a researcher.&#xD;
      Participants will do the thought training program and talk to staff about progress in the&#xD;
      program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During both phases of intervention, participants will be encouraged to send weekly weights&#xD;
      from a provided Bluetooth enabled scale. Participants will also be asked to log their&#xD;
      activity related to the program in the MyFitnessPal app. Researchers will access the&#xD;
      information and send feedback to the participants (via text, phone, and/or email) to help&#xD;
      them succeed in the program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Session 20 will be an in person session between an individual family and the researcher. This&#xD;
      session will act as a follow-up session as there will be an 8 week gap between Session 19 and&#xD;
      Session 20 where there is no study intervention.&#xD;
