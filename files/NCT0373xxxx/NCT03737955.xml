    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies the how well fractionated gemtuzumab ozogamicin works in treating&#xD;
      measurable residual disease in patients with acute myeloid leukemia, high-risk&#xD;
      myelodysplastic syndrome or high-risk myeloproliferative neoplasm. Gemtuzumab ozogamicin is a&#xD;
      monoclonal antibody, called gemtuzumab, linked to a chemotherapy drug, called ozogamicin.&#xD;
      Gemtuzumab is a form of targeted therapy because it attaches to specific molecules&#xD;
      (receptors) on the surface of cancer cells, known as CD33 receptors, and delivers a&#xD;
      chemotherapy known as calicheamicin to kill them.&#xD;

      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive gemtuzumab ozogamicin intravenously (IV) on days 1, 4, 7. Treatment&#xD;
      continues for 35 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
      Responders and non-responders, without significant adverse events during the first course,&#xD;
      may receive a second course of gemtuzumab ozogamicin within 60 days after course 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 6 months.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prior diagnosis AML based on 2016 World Health Organization criteria. Acute&#xD;
             promyelocytic leukemia (APL) and biphenotypic AML are not eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have MRD-level disease only and otherwise meet criteria for complete&#xD;
             response (CR) or complete remission with incomplete hematologic recovery (CRi) per the&#xD;
             2017 European Leukemia Net response criteria (&lt; 5% blasts in the marrow without a&#xD;
             requirement for peripheral blood count recovery). MRD must be measurable by&#xD;
             multiparameter flow cytometry (MPFC) and/or polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based&#xD;
             molecular markers and/or karyotypic markers (e.g., classical cytogenetics or&#xD;
             fluorescence in situ hybridization). MRD status will be centrally confirmed by the&#xD;

             administration of study therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have received at least 1 cycle of standard induction chemotherapy prior&#xD;

             for participation at any time point in treatment (after induction, during or after&#xD;
             consolidation, pre-transplant, or post-transplant). Pediatric patients (2-18 years of&#xD;

             aminotransferase (ALT) &lt; 2.5 x institutional upper limit of normal for age (unless&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  For children (&lt; 18 years of age): Glomerular filtration rate (GFR) in ml/min (age 2:&#xD;
             63-175; age 3-12: 89-165; females 13 and older: 75-115; males 13 and older: 85-125).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  For children (&lt; 18 years of age): Total bilirubin =&lt; 2 x institutional upper limit of&#xD;
             normal for age (unless known history of Gilbert's disease).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  For children (&lt; 18 years of age): AST and ALT &lt; 2.5 x institutional upper limit of&#xD;
             normal for age (unless thought to be related to resolving infectious complications).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ability of patient or representative to provide written informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Females of childbearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test prior to&#xD;
             receiving GO.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects who have had chemotherapy or radiation therapy within 14 days prior to&#xD;
             entering the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects may not be receiving other investigational agents.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Uncontrolled or concurrent illness including, but not limited to, uncontrolled&#xD;
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac&#xD;
             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with&#xD;
             study requirements.&#xD;
