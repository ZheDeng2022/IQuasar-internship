      This study aims to determine changes in kidney function during and after critical illness,&#xD;
      comparing conventional creatinine based methods with the gold standard to accurately&#xD;
      establish the presence of new or worsened chronic kidney disease. In addition, investigators&#xD;
      will assess the confounding effect of muscle wasting on the conventional assessment of kidney&#xD;
      function and investigate the information that measures of kidney function may contribute to&#xD;
      the assessment of musculoskeletal health after critical illness.&#xD;

      More people than ever are surviving life-threatening illnesses such as major trauma. However,&#xD;
      until now doctors and researchers have focused more on improving short term survival than on&#xD;
      the serious, long-term complications experienced by survivors of critical illness. In&#xD;
      response, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) and patient-clinician&#xD;
      partnerships such as the James Lind Alliance, have now prioritised research into the&#xD;
      diagnosis, follow-up and treatment of critical care survivors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Development of chronic kidney disease and persistent muscle weakness are two commonly&#xD;
      encountered complications which significantly impact long-term health and wellbeing after&#xD;
      critical illness. Worsening of kidney function strongly predisposes to development of heart&#xD;
      disease, premature death or need for long-term dialysis. Similarly, the muscle wasting&#xD;
      experienced by almost all survivors of critical illness can result in persistent, life&#xD;
      changing limitations to daily living, inability to work and decreased quality of life.&#xD;
      Importantly, the human and economic consequences of critical illness may be particularly&#xD;
      profound in major trauma victims who are often young and previously healthy. In this project,&#xD;
      investigators will aim to simultaneously measure changes in kidney function and muscle mass&#xD;
      after critical illness allowing researchers to understand how these processes interact in&#xD;
      affecting longer-term patient outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will recruit 62 patients, 31 admitted to intensive care after major trauma&#xD;
      and 31 admitted for other reasons. Complementary methods will be used to accurately monitor&#xD;
      muscle mass and kidney function. Six months after discharge from hospital, patient's ability&#xD;
      to manage their daily activities and quality of life will be assessed alongside measurements&#xD;
      of muscle mass, strength and kidney function. The study will be performed at the Royal London&#xD;
      Hospital, an internationally renowned centre for critical care and trauma research.&#xD;
