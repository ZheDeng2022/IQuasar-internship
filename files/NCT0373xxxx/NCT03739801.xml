    <textblock>
      This phase I/II trial studies the side effects and best dose of MM-398 and ramucirumab in&#xD;
      treating patients with gastric cancer or gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma. MM-398&#xD;
      contains a chemotherapy drug called irinotecan, which in its active form interrupts cell&#xD;
      reproduction. MM-398 builds irinotecan into a container called a liposome which may be able&#xD;
      to release the medicine slowly over time to reduce side effects and increase its ability to&#xD;
      kill tumor cells. Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as ramucirumab, may help the&#xD;
      body's immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to&#xD;
      grow and spread. Giving MM-398 and ramucirumab together may work better in treating patients&#xD;
      with gastric cancer or gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Phase I portion is to determine the recommended phase II dose (RP2D) of liposomal&#xD;
      irinotecan (MM-398) when given in combination with ramucirumab at 8 mg/kg every 2 weeks in&#xD;
      patients with gastric and gastroesophageal adenocarcinoma (GEAC) who had failed or are&#xD;
      intolerant of platinum-based therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Phase II portion is to assess the preliminary efficacy and tolerability of MM-398 in&#xD;
      combination with ramucirumab in patients with GEAC who had failed or are intolerant of&#xD;
      platinum based therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To estimate the best overall response rate through up to three cycles of therapy among&#xD;
      patients with measurable disease at study entry.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To assess the incidence and severity of toxicity of the combination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Descriptive of quality of life domains using Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement&#xD;
      Information System (PROMIS) global health instrument (PRO).&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Descriptive of altered genes on liquid biopsies. III. To assess the effect of the&#xD;
      anti-angiogenic ramucirumab on distribution of MM-398 via magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)&#xD;
      with and without ferumoxytol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose escalation study of MM-398followed by a phase II study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive ramucirumab intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes and MM-398 IV over 90 minutes&#xD;
      on days 1 and 15. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or&#xD;
      unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for up to 6&#xD;
      months.&#xD;
