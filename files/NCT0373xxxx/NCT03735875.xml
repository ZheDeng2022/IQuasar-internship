  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase Ib/II trial studies the side effects and best dose of venetoclax in combination&#xD;
      with quizartinib and how well they work in treating patients with acute myeloid leukemia that&#xD;
      has come back or does not respond to treatment, and who are FLT3-mutation positive.&#xD;
      Venetoclax and quizartinib may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking some of the&#xD;
      enzymes needed for cell growth.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of&#xD;
      the combination of venetoclax with quizartinib in FLT3-internal tandem duplication (ITD)&#xD;
      mutated patients with relapsed/refractory acute myeloid leukemia (AML). (Phase Ib) II. To&#xD;
      determine the composite complete remission (CR) (CRc) rate including CR + CRp (complete&#xD;
      remission with incomplete platelet recovery) + CRi (complete remission with incomplete count&#xD;
      recovery) within 3 months of treatment initiation in FLT3-ITD mutated patients with&#xD;
      relapsed/refractory AML. (Phase II)&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the composite CRc rate including CR + CRp + CRi within 3 months of treatment&#xD;
      initiation in FLT3-ITD mutated patients with relapsed/ refractory AML. (Phase Ib) II. To&#xD;
      determine the overall response rate (ORR) including CRc + partial remission (PR) within 3&#xD;
      months of treatment initiation in FLT3-ITD mutated patients with relapsed/refractory AML.&#xD;
      (Phase Ib) III. To determine the duration of response (DOR), progression free survival,&#xD;
      event-free survival (EFS), overall survival (OS), and number of patients bridged to&#xD;
      hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) and median duration to HSCT from the initiation of&#xD;
      the combination in FLT3-ITD mutated patients with relapsed/ refractory AML. (Phase Ib) IV. To&#xD;
      characterize the pharmacokinetic (PK) profiles of combination therapy of venetoclax and&#xD;
      quizartinib in FLT3-ITD mutated patients with relapsed/refractory AML. (Phase Ib) V. To&#xD;
      determine the ORR within 3 months of treatment initiation in FLT3-ITD mutated patients with&#xD;
      relapsed/ refractory AML. (Phase II) VI. To determine the DOR, progression-free survival&#xD;
      (PFS), EFS, OS, and number of patients bridged to HSCT and median duration to HSCT from the&#xD;
      initiation of the combination in FLT3-ITD mutated patients with relapsed/refractory AML.&#xD;
      (Phase II) VII. To determine the safety and tolerability of the combination in FLT3-ITD&#xD;
      mutated patients with relapsed/refractory AML. (Phase II)&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To investigate possible relationships between baseline next generation gene sequencing and&#xD;
      clinical response to the combination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To investigate quantitative changes of FLT3-ITD allelic burden with time and the extent&#xD;
      of pharmacodynamics biomarker (such as phosphorylated [p]-FLT3, p-ribosomal protein S6 kinase&#xD;
      beta-1 [p70S6K], pERK, pSTAT) inhibition, and the induction of apoptosis in the bone marrow&#xD;
      and peripheral blasts in patients treated with the combination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To investigate possible relationships between baseline gene expression signatures, Bcl-2&#xD;
      family messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) and protein levels of AML blasts and/or stem cell&#xD;
      sub-population, BH3 profiling of Bcl-2 family member dependency and ex vivo functional screen&#xD;
      and clinical response to the combination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To analyze immune modulation including alterations in total and percent of CD3+ T-cells,&#xD;
      total and percent of various T-cell subsets (CD4-effector, CD4-regs, CD8 cytotoxic T-cells),&#xD;
      and total and percent of T-cell/T-cell subsets expressing specific checkpoint&#xD;
      receptors/ligands with the combination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. To store and/or analyze surplus blood or tissue including bone marrow, if available, for&#xD;
      potential future exploratory research into molecular and immune factors that may influence&#xD;
      response to venetoclax and/or quizartinib (where response is defined broadly to include&#xD;
      efficacy, tolerability or safety).&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a phase Ib dose-escalation study of quizartinib, followed by a phase II&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive quizartinib orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-28 and venetoclax PO QD&#xD;
      beginning on day 8 of cycle 1. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 24 cycles in the&#xD;
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients may continue treatment&#xD;
      beyond 24 cycles at the discretion of the treating physician.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days and then every 3-6&#xD;
      months for up to 5 years.&#xD;

               -  Known history of second or third degree heart block (may be eligible if the&#xD;
                  patient currently has a pacemaker) within 3 months prior to starting study drug&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Sustained heart rate of &lt; 50/minute on screening or day 1 ECG&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Right bundle branch block + left anterior hemiblock (i.e. bifascicular block)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Isolated right bundle branch block (RBBB) will not be an exclusion criterion&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Complete left bundle branch block&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Patients with myocardial infarction or unstable angina within 6 months prior to&#xD;
                  starting study drug&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Congestive heart failure (CHF) New York (NY) Heart Association class III or IV&#xD;
                  within 3 months prior to starting study drug&#xD;

&#xD;
               -  Patients who are actively taking CYP3A inducers. CYP3A4 inducers should be&#xD;
                  stopped at least 3 days prior to the first dose of quizartinib and are prohibited&#xD;
                  at any time on study. Moderate and strong CYP3A4 inhibitors should be stopped at&#xD;
                  least 3 days prior to the first dose of quizartinib and are prohibited during&#xD;
                  cycle 1. Moderate (but not strong) CYP3A4 inhibitors may be used with the below&#xD;
                  dose reductions of venetoclax after cycle 1. Patients may receive weak CYP3A4&#xD;
                  inhibitors at any time on study. The venetoclax and quizartinib doses do not need&#xD;
                  to be adjusted for weak CYP3A4 inhibitors&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Patients who require treatment with concomitant drugs that prolong QT/QTc&#xD;
                  interval. QT/QTc prolonging drugs should be stopped at least 3 days prior to the&#xD;
