    <textblock>
      SPEED is a three arm interventional trial nested within a cohort (Trials Within Cohorts or&#xD;
      TWiCs design). This tests more aggressive early therapy in patients newly diagnosed with&#xD;
      moderate to severe PsA. Arm 1 will receive standard step up therapy in the cohort and act as&#xD;
      the control group. Arm 2 will receive early combination conventional synthetic disease&#xD;
      modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (csDMARDs). Arm 3 will receive early tumour necrosis factor&#xD;
      (TNF) inhibitor therapy.&#xD;

      Arm 1: Control 'step-up' therapy in the cohort (MONITOR-PsA study). Therapy for the cohort is&#xD;
      defined by standard practice in these PsA clinics following current international&#xD;
      recommendations[11] and National requirements for the prescription of biologic&#xD;
      therapy[19-22]. Whilst physician discretion is used, most commonly Initial therapy will be&#xD;
      with methotrexate alone (15mg/week rising to 25mg/week as tolerated by week 8 of therapy)&#xD;
      unless this is contraindicated. In cases of non-response or intolerance to methotrexate,&#xD;
      participants will have an alternative DMARD (most commonly sulfasalazine or leflunomide)&#xD;
      added or switched to at the discretion of the rheumatologist. In cases of failure of two&#xD;
      DMARDs, treatment can be escalated to biologic therapy as per National Institute for Health&#xD;
      and Clinical Excellence (NICE) recommendations[19-22] usually with a TNF inhibitor as first&#xD;
      line. If the requisite disease activity is not met or if there are contraindications to&#xD;
      biologics, alternative DMARD combinations will be used. Further details are available in the&#xD;
      PsA clinic treatment protocol which is Appendix D in the MONITOR-PsA protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM 2: Combination DMARD arm. All participants will be prescribed methotrexate with an&#xD;
      additional DMARD (either sulfasalazine or leflunomide) at baseline, staggering the start of&#xD;
      these additional therapies by one week to allow more accurate attribution of adverse events.&#xD;
      Either sulfasalazine or leflumonide will be used in combination depending on physician&#xD;
      preference (taking into account disease presentation, arthritis, enthesitis, skin disease,&#xD;
      risk of hypertension and liver disease).Response will be assessed after 12 weeks of therapy&#xD;
      using the Minimal Disease Activity (MDA) criteria. These assess 7 different outcomes and&#xD;
      patients should meet at least 5 of the 7 items to be classified as being in MDA. Participants&#xD;
      who achieve the MDA criteria by week 12 on this combination therapy will continue on this&#xD;
      therapy. Participants who show a significant response by in week 12 (a reduction in tender&#xD;
      and swollen joint counts of at least 20%) but do not yet meet the MDA criteria should&#xD;
      continue on this therapy for an additional 12 weeks before review. Participants failing to&#xD;
      show significant response (reduction in joint counts by less than 20%) by week 12 on this&#xD;
      combination therapy or those failing to meet MDA criteria by week 24 will be eligible for&#xD;
      rescue therapy following the standard PsA clinic treatment protocol (as per arm 1 above and&#xD;
      as detailed in the PsA clinic treatment protocol which is found in appendix D of the&#xD;
      MONITOR-PsA protocol). Participants may be eligible at this time point for biologic therapy&#xD;
      most commonly using TNF inhibitors under NICE guidelines. These state that patients should&#xD;
      have failed adequate trials of at least 2 standard DMARDs and that they should have active&#xD;
      disease defined as at least 3 tender and 3 swollen joints. If they do not fulfil these NICE&#xD;
      criteria (≥3 tender and ≥3 swollen joints) they will be prescribed alternative DMARDs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM 3: Early biologic arm. All participants will be prescribed methotrexate (given weekly)&#xD;
      with a TNF inhibitor (adalimumab given every two weeks) at baseline staggering the start of&#xD;
      these therapies by one week to allow more accurate attribution of adverse events (TNF&#xD;
      inhibitor from week 0, methotrexate from week 1). Treatment with TNF inhibitor will be&#xD;
      continued until week 24 at which time the TNF inhibitor will be tapered by spacing out doses&#xD;
      which will be received at week 28 and week 32. The TNF inhibitor will be stopped completely&#xD;
      after week 32 and participants will continue on methotrexate. In case of flare of disease,&#xD;
      participants will be eligible for rescue therapy following the standard PsA clinic treatment&#xD;
      protocol (as per arm 1 above and as detailed in the PsA clinic treatment protocol which is&#xD;
      found in appendix D of the MONITOR-PsA protocol). According to this protocol they will be&#xD;
      started on combination DMARD therapy (sulfasalazine or leflunomide) and may subsequently be&#xD;
      eligible for further TNF inhibitor treatment at a later point if they fulfil NICE criteria&#xD;
      (as above).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Investigational Medicinal Products (IMPs) used in this trial are methotrexate,&#xD;
      sulfasalazine, leflunomide and adalimumab. All of these medications are used routinely in PsA&#xD;
      patients in standard care.&#xD;
