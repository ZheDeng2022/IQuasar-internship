  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the proposed project is to pilot test an automated mobile phone-based&#xD;
      contingency management (CM) approach to tobacco (smoking) cessation. With the assistance of&#xD;
      the Mobile Health (mHealth) shared resource at the University of Oklahoma Health Sciences&#xD;
      Center (OUHSC) and Stephenson Cancer Center (SCC), the investigators have combined&#xD;
      technologies including 1) low-cost carbon monoxide monitors that connect with mobile phones&#xD;
      to remotely verify smoking abstinence, 2) facial recognition software to confirm the identity&#xD;
      of participants while they provide a breath sample, and 3) remote delivery of incentives&#xD;
      automatically triggered by biochemical confirmation of self-reported smoking abstinence. This&#xD;
      automated, mobile CM approach will be evaluated in a randomized controlled pilot trial of 40&#xD;
      socioeconomically disadvantaged males and females seeking smoking cessation treatment.&#xD;
      Participants will be randomly assigned to telephone counseling plus nicotine replacement&#xD;
      therapy (standard care [SC]) or SC plus a 12-week mobile financial incentives intervention&#xD;
      (CM) for biochemically-confirmed abstinence. Participants will be followed for 12 weeks after&#xD;
      a scheduled quit attempt to assess smoking status.&#xD;

      Tobacco Cessation Treatment. Participants referred to the Tobacco Treatment Research Program&#xD;
      (TTRP) for smoking cessation treatment who are interested and eligible for the current study&#xD;
      will be offered weekly telephone counseling/support sessions led by a staff counselor. Six&#xD;
      unique sessions covering the following topics will be offered: 1) quit planning 2) the impact&#xD;
      of tobacco on health/benefits of quitting, 2) stress management strategies, 3) making&#xD;
      positive lifestyle changes, 4) developing coping skills, and 5) relapse prevention. The&#xD;
      counselor will check in with participants each week about the difficulties and successes they&#xD;
      have experienced, and plan for any challenging situations that are anticipated. Advice and&#xD;
      support will be provided as needed. A two-week supply of nicotine replacement therapy&#xD;
      (patches and gum) will be offered during the first session for medically eligible&#xD;
      participants. Additional patches and gum will be mailed out for participants who wish to&#xD;
      continue using pharmacotherapy (for up to 12 weeks).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Financial Incentives. Participants will be provided with a smartphone that has the SCC&#xD;
      PREVAILgo EMA app preloaded, as well as a Smokerlyzer iCO monitor. Participants will be&#xD;
      randomly prompted 4 times daily during waking hours to complete smartphone-based EMAs&#xD;
      (ecological momentary assessments). During random prompts, participants who self-report&#xD;
      abstinence will be asked to provide a CO breath sample on 5 randomly selected days out of the&#xD;
      week. Participants will be prompted to provide a CO breath sample at the last random&#xD;
      assessment of the day, Participants will be reminded 2 additional times on the same day&#xD;
      during their normal waking hours to provide a CO breath sample if they miss the initial&#xD;
      assessment. A gift card credit may be earned following a self-report of abstinence during the&#xD;
      past 24 hours combined with a breath CO sample of ≤ 6 ppm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment/Screening (Visit 1, Part 1; Screening). Individuals who are referred to the TTRP&#xD;
      for smoking cessation treatment and report that they are uninsured or receiving Medicaid&#xD;
      benefits will be sent an informational handout with their TTRP information packet (prior to&#xD;
      their first visit). Participants will be reminded of all future in-person appointments via&#xD;
      telephone, mail, email, and/or text. Additionally, research staff may attempt to collect&#xD;
      smoking cessation status with each reminder. Participants with transportation difficulties&#xD;
      living in the Oklahoma City metro area may be scheduled for pick-up and drop-off for key&#xD;
      visits with SendaRide through their secure dashboard. At the first visit, study staff will&#xD;
      inquire about their interest in finding out more about the study. Study staff will review the&#xD;
      consent form with interested participants, and they will be screened for eligibility on-site&#xD;
      in a private room in the clinic. Participant eligibility for the current study will not&#xD;
      influence eligibility for the TTRP. The Rapid Estimate of Adult Literacy in Medicine (REALM;&#xD;
      see Appendix A) will be administered to ensure that all participants are able to read at ≥&#xD;
      sixth grade level (i.e., required to complete EMA and self-report questionnaires). Expired&#xD;
      carbon monoxide (CO) will be measured and participants will be questioned about their 1)&#xD;
      insurance status 2) age, 3) current level of smoking, 4) willingness to quit smoking, 5)&#xD;
      willingness/ability to complete 6 weekly counseling sessions (including the first visit), 6)&#xD;
      pregnancy/breastfeeding status, 7) computer/internet access, and 8) contraindications for&#xD;
      nicotine replacement therapy. Expired CO will be measured. Eligible participants may complete&#xD;
      the assessment portion of the visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pre-Quit (Visit 1, Part 2; Assessment). Participants will complete self-report questionnaires&#xD;
      on a laptop computer; weight and height will be measured in a private room to ensure&#xD;
      confidentiality. Visit 1 will be 1 of 2 in-person visits. Participants will be provided with&#xD;
      an Android smartphone and a Smokerlyzer iCO breathe monitor. They will be instructed&#xD;
      regarding the use of the phone (participants may make personal calls), the EMA procedures,&#xD;
      and use of the portable CO monitor. Participants will receive 4 random prompts and 1 daily&#xD;
      diary prompt (in the morning) during the normal waking hours each day for five consecutive&#xD;
      weeks. Participants will be instructed to quit smoking at bedtime or 10:00 pm (whichever&#xD;
      occurs first) 7 days after enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Quit Day. Participants will remotely complete web-based self-report questionnaires and&#xD;
      provide a smartphone-based CO measurement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One Week Post-Quit. Participants will remotely complete web-based self-report questionnaires&#xD;
      and provide a smartphone-based CO measurement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two Weeks Post-Quit. Participants will remotely complete web-based self-report questionnaires&#xD;
      and provide a smartphone-based CO measurement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Three Weeks Post-Quit. Participants will remotely complete web-based self-report&#xD;
      questionnaires and provide a smartphone-based CO measurement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Four Weeks Post-Quit. Participants will remotely complete web-based self-report&#xD;
      questionnaires and provide a smartphone-based CO measurement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eight Weeks Post-Quit. Participants will remotely complete web-based self-report&#xD;
      questionnaires and provide a smartphone-based CO measurement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Twelve Weeks Post-Quit. Participants will return to the TTRP and complete self-report&#xD;
      questionnaires on a tablet or laptop computer and provide a CO measurement.&#xD;
