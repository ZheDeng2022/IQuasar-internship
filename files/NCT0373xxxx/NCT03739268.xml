  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to investigate the potential GLP-1-mediated contribution to&#xD;
      the well-established glucose-lowering effect of sevelamer-induced bile acid sequestration .&#xD;
      Exendin9-39 has been demonstrated to act as a potent and specific GLP-1 receptor antagonist&#xD;
      with no partial agonistic potential and is considered a useful tool in the assessment of&#xD;
      GLP-1 physiology. The aim is to evaluate any contribution of sevelamer-induced GLP-1&#xD;
      secretion to the reduced plasma glucose concentrations observed after treatment with&#xD;
      sevelamer. A randomised placebo-controlled cross-over study involving two 17-day treatment&#xD;
      periods with sevelamer and placebo, respectively, in metformin-treated patients with type 2&#xD;
      diabetes, will be conducted. The impact of bile acid sequestration on GLP-1 secretion and&#xD;
      effect will be examined during two randomised experimental days after 15 and 17 days of&#xD;
      treatment with sevelamer (1,600 mg three times a day) and placebo, respectively. During each&#xD;
      of these two experimental days, a meal test with concomitant exendin9-39 infusion or placebo&#xD;
      will be performed (for evaluation of any GLP-1-mediated effects). Postprandial plasma glucose&#xD;
      excursion is the primary endpoint, and secondary endpoints include postprandial plasma/serum&#xD;
      excursions of insulin, C-peptide, GLP-1, glucagon, glucose-dependent insulinotropic&#xD;
      polypeptide (GIP), glucagon-like peptide-2 (GLP-2), peptide YY (PYY), oxyntomodulin, ghrelin,&#xD;
      fibroblast growth factor (FGF)-19, FGF-21, C4 (an intermediate in the de novo synthesis of&#xD;
      bile acids), cholecystokinin (CCK), bile acids and plasma lipids. Furthermore, gastric&#xD;
      emptying, gallbladder emptying, liver fat content, appetite and ad libitum food intake will&#xD;
      be examined.&#xD;
