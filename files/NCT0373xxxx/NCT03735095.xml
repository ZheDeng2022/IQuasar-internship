    <textblock>
      This Phase I/Ila studies the side effects of endobronchial ultrasound guided interstitial&#xD;
      photodynamic therapy work in treating patients with lung cancer that has spread to nearby&#xD;
      tissues or lymph nodes. Photodynamic therapy consists of injecting a light sensitive drug&#xD;
      called a photosensitizer, such as porfimer sodium, into the vein, waiting for it to&#xD;
      accumulate in the tumor, and then activating it with a red laser light. Giving photodynamic&#xD;
      therapy with Porfimer sodium may reduce the tumor size in patients with lung cancer.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES PHASE 1:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate the safety and potential efficacy of endobronchial ultrasound with&#xD;
      transbronchial needle (EBUS-TBN) guided interstitial photodynamic therapy (EBUS-TBN I-PDT)&#xD;
      and/or I-PDT and/or photodynamic therapy (PDT) in patients with locally advanced lung cancer&#xD;
      (LALC) in the central airway, using porfimer sodium as a photosensitizer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE Phase II&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  I. To assess the tumor response to treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  II To observe changes in well being&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  I. To evaluate local progression-free survival (PFS).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  II.To compare the treatment planning in DOSIE™ with the plan generated in COMSOL™&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Examine porfimer sodium retention in the target tumor tissue. II. Examine the relationship&#xD;
      between immune biomarkers and response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive Porfimer sodium intravenously (IV) over 20 minutes 2-4 hours prior to the&#xD;
      delivery of I-PDT. Patients then undergo EBUS-TBN guided I-PDT over 30-45 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 4, 8, 12, and 24 weeks.&#xD;
