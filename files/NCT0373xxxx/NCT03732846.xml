                  times), serum creatinine ≤ 1.5 times the upper limit of normal;&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Subjects voluntarily joined the study and signed informed consent, with good adherence&#xD;
             and follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Subjects who have previously used Anlotinib;&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Systematic anti-tumor treatments have been performed for the past 2 weeks, including&#xD;
             chemotherapy, radiotherapy (except for metastatic lesions other than thoracic&#xD;
             radiation), targeted therapy, immunotherapy, and biotherapy;&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Imaging (CT or MRI) shows central tumors in which tumor lesions invade local large&#xD;
             blood vessels; imaging (CT or MRI) shows significant pulmonary cavitary or necrotizing&#xD;

             clear tendency to gastrointestinal bleeding (such as esophageal varices with bleeding&#xD;
             risk, local activity) Ulcer lesions, etc.) or active hemoptysis;&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. A thrombotic event occurs within 6 months (including arteriovenous thrombosis,&#xD;
             pulmonary embolism, cerebrovascular accident, including transient ischemic attack,&#xD;
             etc.);&#xD;

             (including clinically significant QTc interval prolongation history, or screening&#xD;
             period QTc interval women &gt;470ms, Male &gt; 450ms), had myocardial infarction within 6&#xD;
             months, or cardiac insufficiency;&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Hypertension, which is uncontrolled by the drug, is defined as: systolic blood&#xD;
             pressure ≥ 160 mmHg, or diastolic blood pressure ≥ 100 mmHg;&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Clinically obvious gastrointestinal abnormalities, which may affect the intake,&#xD;
             transport or absorption of drugs (such as inability to swallow, chronic diarrhea,&#xD;
             intestinal obstruction, etc.), or patients with total gastrectomy;&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Surgery (&lt;28 days) before the study was selected or the surgical incision did not&#xD;
             completely heal, or there were other unhealed wounds;&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Active or uncontrolled serious infections;&#xD;
