  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators are conducting a study on pain control for dilation and curettage (D&amp;C).&#xD;
      Participants are eligible to enroll if they are a planning to have a D&amp;C in a participating&#xD;
      clinic. The investigators are studying how different ratios of medication to liquid affect&#xD;
      pain when injected around the cervix. Both potential methods use the same dose of medication,&#xD;
      though researchers would like to know which one works better. To be in this study,&#xD;
      participants must be over the age of 18 with an early pregnancy loss or undesired pregnancy&#xD;
      measuring less than 12 weeks gestation undergoing D&amp;C while awake in clinic.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Dilation and Curettage (D&amp;C) is often performed in the first trimester for surgical abortion&#xD;
      and management of miscarriage and can be painful for patients before and after the procedure.&#xD;
      Most procedures are performed while the patient is awake or with minimal sedation in the&#xD;
      clinic setting, and a key component of pain control is the paracervical block, or injecting&#xD;
      lidocaine into the tissue around the cervix. A paracervical block with 20cc of 1% buffered&#xD;
      lidocaine has been proven to provide superior pain control than a sham paracervical block.&#xD;
      However, many providers often use similar doses of lidocaine in a higher volume to improve&#xD;
      pain control. At University of California, San Diego (UCSD) and University of California, Los&#xD;
      Angeles (UCLA), some providers routinely use a 20cc of 1% buffered lidocaine block and some&#xD;
      routinely use a 40cc of 0.5% buffered lidocaine block. This practice has not been studied in&#xD;
      a randomized controlled trial. The purpose of this study is to compare pain control during&#xD;
      D&amp;C with a 20cc 1% buffered lidocaine with vasopressin paracervical block compared to a 40cc&#xD;
      0.5% buffered lidocaine with vasopressin paracervical block.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An inclusion criterion for this study is that patients must specifically be referred to&#xD;
      family planning clinics at UCSD and UCLA for an in-clinic D&amp;C. Therefore, the D&amp;C is a&#xD;
      required procedure for both study groups. The only difference in care between the study&#xD;
      groups will be which paracervical block they receive.&#xD;
