      a prospective non-randomized study conducted upon 24 patients with severe lower punctual&#xD;
      stenosis (grade 0 according to Kashkouli scale) attending at Menoufia University hospitals.&#xD;
      The upper punctum and canaliculus were patent. All patients were complaining of epiphora and&#xD;
      had a thorough ophthalmological examination including dye disappearance test, and slit-lamp&#xD;
      examination. Pigtail probe was used from patent upper punctum to detect the lower stenosed&#xD;
      punctum which was opened with a scalpel. Syringing of the lower lacrimal passages was done to&#xD;
      confirm its patency and self retaining silicone bicanalicular stent was inserted. The&#xD;
      silicone tube was left in place for 6 months before it was removed. Patients were then&#xD;
      followed up for 1 year after the surgery.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This is a prospective non-randomized study which was conducted upon 24 patients with total&#xD;
      lower punctual occlusion attending at Menoufia University hospitals in the period from&#xD;
      January 2014 to January 2018. Ethics approval from the institutional review board was&#xD;
      obtained, and a written informed consent was taken from every patient according to the&#xD;
      Declaration of Helsinki.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients of the study were complaining of epiphora and had a thorough ophthalmological&#xD;
      examination including dye disappearance test, and slit-lamp examination. The dye&#xD;
      disappearance test was performed with a drop of 2% fluorescein sodium and assessment after 5&#xD;
      minutes of the remaining dye in the tear meniscus was done and results were graded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Surgical procedure&#xD;
&#xD;
      All operations were done under general anesthesia and were performed by two authors (SSM,&#xD;
      KES). The authors performed lacrimal probing and syringing test through the normal punctum to&#xD;
      exclude concomitant occluded common canaliculus or nasolacrimal duct. The pigtail probe was&#xD;
      passed through the canalicular system from the normal punctum to the occluded aspect. When&#xD;
      the tip of the pigtail probe was positioned near the occluded punctal area, the surgeon&#xD;
      pushed the area to be tented with the pigtail probe. After they advanced the pigtail probe&#xD;
      back and forth several times until they could locate the correct position of the occluded&#xD;
      punctum, the authors incised the tented area with a scalpel No. 11 to make a new punctal&#xD;
      opening.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To ensure punctal and canalicular patency, syringing was repeated through the perforated&#xD;
      punctum. To prevent re-occlusion of punctal opening, a self retaining bicanalicular tube&#xD;
      (FCI®; Paris, France) was inserted through the normal and perforated puncti.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The silicone tube was left in place for 6 months before it was removed. Patients were then&#xD;
      followed up for 1 year after the surgery (6 months after removal of the tube). During the&#xD;
      follow-up period, the authors investigated the improvement of subjective epiphora symptoms&#xD;
      based on Munk score, fluorescein disappearance test, maintenance of newly formed punctal&#xD;
      opening, and incidence of complications.&#xD;
