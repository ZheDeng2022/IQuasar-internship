      Dry eye disease, ocular graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), and superior limbic&#xD;
      keratoconjunctivitis (SLK) are all ocular surface disorders which mostly involve the outer&#xD;
      surface of the eye. Many of the ocular surface disorders may result from or be aggravated by&#xD;
      the mechanical stress from eyelid blinking. Specifically, SLK is an inflammatory ocular&#xD;
      surface disorder characterizing by redundant superior bulbar conjunctiva. Since redundant&#xD;
      superior bulbar conjunctiva can cause a significant mechanical force during eyelid blinking,&#xD;
      we found that conjunctival resection with Tenon's capsule excision is helpful in relieving&#xD;
      the symptoms of SLK patients. Therapeutic contact lens, protecting the ocular surface from&#xD;
      the microtrauma between eyelid and ocular surface, is also an effective treatment for severe&#xD;
      dry eye disease, ocular GVHD, and SLK. Although shearing force/mechanical stress has been&#xD;
      studied in many different tissues and disease entities, the impact of shearing force over&#xD;
      ocular surface is still unclear.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While the importance of mechanical stress in ocular surface disorder has been reported, the&#xD;
      specific molecule involving the pathogenesis is still unknown. Diadenosine polyphosphates are&#xD;
      a family of dinucleotides. They can enhance tear secretion and increase corneal wound healing&#xD;
      rate from previous reports. Shear-stress stimuli was also noted to be able to induce&#xD;
      diadenosine polyphosphates releasing from human corneal epithelium. In addition, mucin, one&#xD;
      of the three components of tear film, has been greatly emphasized in the pathogenesis of dry&#xD;
      eye disease. There are also some reports about the shearing force compensating the mucin&#xD;
      contents in the inflammatory lung/bowel diseases. If diadenosine polyphosphates or mucin&#xD;
      indeed play a role in mechanical stress-related ocular surface disorders, it will be a&#xD;
      promising therapeutic targeting in the future.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Ocular surface disorders are diseases involving the most outer surface of the eyeball - the&#xD;
      transparent layers that forms the front of the eye, including cornea and conjunctiva. One of&#xD;
      the most common ocular surface disorders is dry eye disease (DED) which has a great impact on&#xD;
      patients' quality of life. In addition, ocular graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) and superior&#xD;
      limbic keratoconjunctivitis (SLK) are also ocular surface disorders affecting patients'&#xD;
      quality of life significantly.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Great impact of ocular surface disorders on quality of life 1.1. Impact of dry eye&#xD;
           disease Dry eye disease (DED) is a common ocular surface disorder. Vision-related&#xD;
           quality of life in dry eye patients is impaired and is correlated with anxiety and&#xD;
           depression.1 Patients with DED are often evaluated by a symptom scale called ocular&#xD;
           surface disorder index (OSDI). The OSDI is a valid and reliable scale for diagnosis and&#xD;
           measurement of the severity of DED or other ocular surface disorder. It is also a&#xD;
           convenient option for clinical use as a result of its shorter completion time.&#xD;
&#xD;
           1.2. Impact of GVHD GVHD caused by alloreactive donor T cells is an important cause of&#xD;
           nonrelapse mortality and morbidity after allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation&#xD;
           (HCT). Ocular GVHD reportedly occurs in more than 50% of allogeneic HCT recipients with&#xD;
           chronic GVHD. It can affect all parts of the eye, but the ocular surface is the most&#xD;
           common level of involvement. Yoshi et al suggested strong correlations of serial changes&#xD;
           in the NIH eye score, the OSDI, and the Lee eye subscale. Given that the OSDI consists&#xD;
           of 12 items instead of the 3 for the Lee eye subscale, they found little basis for&#xD;
           recommending the OSDI to measure change in the activity of ocular GVHD. Therefore, the&#xD;
           Lee eye subscale might be a good choice for determining the impact of ocular GVHD on&#xD;
           quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
           1.3. Impact of SLK SLK is an ocular surface disorder characterized by unilateral or&#xD;
           bilateral redundancy of the superior bulbar conjunctiva with inflammation of the&#xD;
           superior tarsal and bulbar conjunctiva. There are many patients suffering by the&#xD;
           symptoms of SLK because of its unclear etiology and no standard treatment. In addition,&#xD;
           SLK is not easy to make a definite diagnosis, the impact of SLK on quality of life could&#xD;
           be underestimated.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Mechanical stress from eyelid blinking may be an aggravating or contributing factor of&#xD;
           ocular GVHD and SLK 2.1. The symptoms of ocular GVHD relieved by bandage soft contact&#xD;
           lens (BSCL) application via the isolation from mechanical stress (eyelid blinking) and&#xD;
           ocular surface The standard treatment of ocular GVHD is still not in consensus. Because&#xD;
           of the immune reaction participating in the pathogenesis of ocular GVHD, some topical&#xD;
           immunosuppressants, such as cyclosporine A (CsA) and tacrolimus, are applied on the&#xD;
           patients with ocular GVHD. Allogeneic serum eye drops and autologous plasma rich in&#xD;
           platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) eye drops were also reported to be effective in&#xD;
           chronic ocular GVHD patients. For medication refractory cases, punctal plugs, scleral&#xD;
           lens, and bandage soft contact lens (BSCL) could be applied as alternative treatments&#xD;
           for ocular GVHD patient. According to previous report, BSCL is a safe and effective&#xD;
           treatment option that improves manifestations of ocular GVHD. BSCL can act as a barrier&#xD;
           to further epithelial disruption and corneal nerve stimulation by the shearing force of&#xD;
           the upper lid during the blink.&#xD;
&#xD;
           2.2. Mechanical stress plays a role in the pathogenesis of SLK Mechanical stimulation&#xD;
           may contribute to the pathogenesis of SLK. We speculated that this kind of physical&#xD;
           trauma not only results in the keratinization of conjunctival epithelium, but also&#xD;
           induced inflammatory cells and mediators, such as mast cells and cytokines,&#xD;
           respectively. Three out of 8 SLK patients benefitted from large diameter contact lens&#xD;
           application. Conjunctival resection with Tenon's capsule excision was also reported as a&#xD;
           beneficial treatment for medication refractory SLK patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. The expression of diadenosine polyphosphates and mucin may alter the clinical&#xD;
           presentation or diagnosis of ocular surface disorders 3.1. Dinucleoside polyphosphates&#xD;
           in ocular surface disorder Diadenosine polyphosphates are a family of dinucleotides,&#xD;
           consisting of two adenosine nucleosides joined by a phosphate chain whose length can&#xD;
           vary from 2 to 7 phosphates. They are released from nerve terminals to the extracellular&#xD;
           milieu where they can exert actions by interacting with purinergic receptors.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Since the levels of diadenosine tetraphosphate (Ap4A) and diadenosine pentaphosphate&#xD;
           (Ap5A) in tears were found to be greater in all dry eye patients, these compounds could&#xD;
           be objective markers to score dry eye. In the forced blink experiments, concentrations&#xD;
           of the diadenosine polyphosphates rose with increasing blink frequency.13 In addition,&#xD;
           topical application of diadenosine tetraphosphate was also noted to be able to stimulate&#xD;
           tear secretion in vivo. Because of the higher levels of Ap4A found in refractive surgery&#xD;
           patients during the first day after the surgery, this dinucleotide release might help in&#xD;
           the wound healing process as well.&#xD;
&#xD;
           3.2. Mucin in ocular surface disorder Mucin plays an important role over the ocular&#xD;
           surface. It converts the hydrophobic corneal surface to a hydrophilic surface by&#xD;
           adhering to the glycocalyx on the corneal microvilli. It also contributes differently to&#xD;
           the protection of the ocular surface against allergens, pathogens, extracellular&#xD;
           molecules, abrasive stress, and drying. MUC1 (mucin 1), 2, 4, 5AC, and 7 are the&#xD;
           subtypes of mucin that can be found over ocular surface, including cornea, conjunctiva,&#xD;
           goblet cell, and lacrimal gland.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Ocular surface pathologies, i.e. dry eye syndrome or allergic conjunctivitis, are&#xD;
           reportedly associated with alteration of expression pattern of mucin components.&#xD;
           Although dryness of the ocular surface is a fundamental situation, local inflammation in&#xD;
           the epithelium plays critical roles in the pathogenesis and symptom in patients with dry&#xD;
           eye syndrome. Mucin deficiency can lead to inflammation in the ocular surface.&#xD;
           Expression of MUC1, MUC2, MUC4, and MUC5AC are significantly lower in conjunctival&#xD;
           epithelium gathered by impression cytology in the patients with dry eye syndrome&#xD;
           compared with that in normal subject.18 Reduction of MUC1 expression in dry eye local&#xD;
           tissue is reportedly most prominent and could be a marker for diagnosis or evaluation of&#xD;
           the disease severity. Topical eye drop of Rebamipide, a drug that is capable of&#xD;
           stimulating of mucin secretion in gastrointestinal tract or conjunctiva, is approved in&#xD;
           Japanese government for use in the treatment of dry eye diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Mucin was also reported as an important factor contributing to some allergic&#xD;
           keratoconjunctivitis. In the patients with atopic keratoconjunctivitis, expression of&#xD;
           goblet cell-specific mucin, MUC5AC mRNA, was reduced and MUC16 mRNA expression was&#xD;
           upregulated in brush cytology specimens. Besides, patients with vernal&#xD;
           keratoconjunctivitis had increased numbers of conjunctival goblet cells from impression&#xD;
           cytology specimen. This phenomenon also altered the levels of mucin over the ocular&#xD;
           surface.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Mechanical stress can violate the levels of diadenosine polyphosphates and mucin 4.1.&#xD;
           Diadenosine polyphosphate under mechanical stress It is known that cells under stress&#xD;
           accumulate various dinucleoside polyphosphates, compounds suggested to function as&#xD;
           alarmones. The release of diadenosine polyphosphates to the tears can be caused by shear&#xD;
           stress, such as that corneal epithelial cells release these molecules as a consequence&#xD;
           of the lid contact during the blinking process. Daily wear of rigid gas permeable lenses&#xD;
           also can increase the levels of Ap4A due to mechanical stimulation by blinking of the&#xD;
           corneal epithelium, and this is associated with discomfort.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4.2. Mucin under mechanical stress Gastrointestinal tract and upper airway are the organ&#xD;
      systems filled with mucin as an important protection. MUC1 and MUC4 in the colon and MUC3 in&#xD;
      the duodenum were upregulated in stressed animals. These findings suggest that chronic stress&#xD;
      may affect mucin expression in the gastrointestinal tract. In addition, human bronchial&#xD;
      epithelial cell cultures (HBECCs) are very sensitive to the mechanical stress associated with&#xD;
      handling and pipetting. Mucin secretion at baseline in vivo occurs in a mechanically dynamic&#xD;
      lung environment: goblet cells are exposed continuously to mechanical forces, shear stress&#xD;
      and compressive stress, that may stimulate and/or influence the production and secretion of&#xD;
      mucins.&#xD;
