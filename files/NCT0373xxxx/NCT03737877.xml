  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Children with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) can suffer debilitating&#xD;
      symptoms, including problematic behaviour and sleep. Research suggests dietary manipulations&#xD;
      may be a helpful treatment option for children with ADHD, although the most effective are&#xD;
      highly restrictive, with little known about why they might work. Optimising gut bacteria in&#xD;
      individuals with ADHD may help alleviate some of the symptoms of this condition via the&#xD;
      gut-brain-axis and would provide a plausible mechanism by which dietary interventions&#xD;
      operate. We propose to conduct a feasibility pilot study of a dietary intervention designed&#xD;
      to optimise gut bacteria in children diagnosed with ADHD.&#xD;

    <description>The parents will have four group sessions with a nutritional therapist, where in depth advice and information about the diet will be provided. Ongoing support will also be provided throughout the study by use of a closed Facebook or WhatsApp group (whichever the parents choose as most appropriate). The diet is based on five main principles:&#xD;
Eat at least seven portions of different varieties of fruit and vegetables each day.&#xD;
Have a 12 hour overnight break from food (water only during this time).&#xD;
Drink a Kefir drink each day - provided free of charge.&#xD;
Eat a microbiome friendly, protein rich, breakfast from our menu.&#xD;
Reduce sugar and artificial sweeteners.</description>
