  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase II single arm efficacy/safety trial that will evaluate the effectiveness of&#xD;
      combining intensive locoregional intraperitoneal (IP) chemoimmunotherapy of cisplatin with IP&#xD;
      rintatolimod (TLR-3 agonist) and IV infusion of the checkpoint inhibitor pembrolizumab (IVP)&#xD;
      for patients with recurrent platinum-sensitive ovarian cancer (OC).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients will receive a total of six treatment cycles, at 3-week intervals. The study will&#xD;
      use an IP neoadjuvant approach (IP chemoimmunotherapy of cisplatin with IP rintatolimod and&#xD;
      IV infusion of pembrolizumab), followed by interval cytoreduction (usually laparoscopically)&#xD;
      of residual tumor. Cytoreduction will occur approximately 4 weeks after the fourth treatment&#xD;
      cycle. Post-surgery the investigators will consolidate with 2 additional courses of same&#xD;
      chemo-immunotherapy regimen. Catheter will be removed 12 weeks after the last treatment. All&#xD;
      surgical procedures, if done laparoscopically, are outpatient and will yield up to three&#xD;
      serial biopsies of the tumor sites: 1) at catheter placement; 2) at interval cytoreduction&#xD;
      which consists of removal of any visible tumor sites and the site biopsied initially whether&#xD;
      tumor is present or not; 3) at catheter removal, when site of first tumor biopsy will be&#xD;
      re-biopsied for pathologic response.&#xD;

             the subject to participate, in the opinion of the treating investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
         21. Has known psychiatric or substance abuse disorders that would interfere with&#xD;
