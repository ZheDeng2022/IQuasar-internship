      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The human microbiota is the bacteria and other microbes found in and on the human body.&#xD;
      Scientists study the microbiota because it is related to many health conditions. The way&#xD;
      samples are collected and handled can greatly affect microbiota study findings. Researchers&#xD;
      want to learn more about how collection methods affect these studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To compare different oral and fecal collection methods. To test the effect of new methods to&#xD;
      get DNA out of these samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adults ages 18 and older who are National Cancer Institute employees and have not taken&#xD;
      antibiotics in the past 3 months&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will discuss the study with researchers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will give an oral or fecal sample or both.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the oral sample, participants will be told what not to do beforehand. This includes&#xD;
      chewing gum and smoking. Participants will spit saliva into a tube. Then they will get&#xD;
      mouthwash in a vial. They will swish and gargle the mouthwash for 30 seconds then spit it&#xD;
      back in the vial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants giving a fecal sample will get a collection kit. They can collect the sample at&#xD;
      home or elsewhere. Participants will have a bowel movement into the collection container.&#xD;
      They will smear some of it on a card with a stick and put the rest in 2 tubes. They will mix&#xD;
      the feces with the solution in the tubes. Participants will write the date and time of&#xD;
      collection on the instructions and return the sample within 24 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants providing both samples could have 3 study visits: 1 to give an oral sample, 1 to&#xD;
      get the fecal sample collection kit, and 1 to return that sample.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The human microbiome (i.e., the collection of microbial genes found in and on the human body)&#xD;
      has been observed to be associated with numerous health conditions, but current&#xD;
      methodological studies suggest that collection method, laboratory handling, bioinformatic&#xD;
      processing of the data, and other factors can greatly affect microbiome study findings. In&#xD;
      cohort studies, samples should be collected using validated methods that can be analyzed&#xD;
      using multiple technologies, however these technologies and methods are regularly changing&#xD;
      and being modified. Therefore, we need to test multiple collection methods for new&#xD;
      technologies or test new collection methods to assess the comparability of the results. We&#xD;
      will evaluate the effect of several collection methods for oral and/or fecal samples from 100&#xD;
      individuals who work at the NCI on microbial characteristics. Once the samples are collected,&#xD;
      we will create aliquots and store the samples for further processing. We will then test the&#xD;
      effect of new DNA extraction methods, sequencing technologies, and bioinformatics pipelines&#xD;
      using these samples. Any remaining aliquots will remain in the -80 degrees Celsius freezer&#xD;
      for other future studies. This study will be essential to understand the impact of collection&#xD;
      methods for oral and fecal samples for future epidemiologic studies.&#xD;

        We plan to recruit 100 adults who work at the NCI, either in Shady Grove or in the Advanced&#xD;
        Technology Center (ATC), who are willing to provide oral and/or fecal samples. We will&#xD;
        include any participant that is at least 18 years of age or older who is employed at NCI&#xD;
        and has not taken antibiotics anytime in the past 3 months since antibiotic use has been&#xD;
        shown to disrupt the microbiota.&#xD;
