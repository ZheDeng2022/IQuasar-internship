  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Supporting patients in exerting choice over their treatment is a central aspect of modern&#xD;
      healthcare. In Improving Access to Psychological Therapies (IAPT) services, then patients&#xD;
      treated at step 2 are only and always offered cognitive-behaviourally informed guided&#xD;
      self-help (GSH), when they are deemed suitable for treatment at step 2 of IAPT services&#xD;
      (termed CBT-GSH). Step 2 interventions are guided self-help (GSH) delivered by Psychological&#xD;
      Wellbeing Practitioners (PWPs). Recently, a new type of GSH has been developed and found to&#xD;
      be feasible and effective in IAPT services - this is called cognitive-analytic guided&#xD;
      self-help (CAT-GSH). This research aims to test the efficacy of CAT-GSH by comparing outcomes&#xD;
      over time achieved in both types of GSH and interviewing participants about their experience&#xD;
      of the GSH. The methodology to support patient choice is a patient preference trial. In this&#xD;
      method, then patients that meet inclusion criteria for the trial are offered and choose&#xD;
      between either CAT-GSH and CBT-GSH. Those patients that are unconcerned with the type of&#xD;
      treatment are randomised to either CAT-GSH or CBT-GSH. The primary outcome measure is the&#xD;
      Beck Anxiety Inventory. No changes to the standard practice of the PWPs will occur during the&#xD;
      trial, the trial will be situated in a standard IAPT service and be a therefore conducted in&#xD;
      a routine practice setting.&#xD;
