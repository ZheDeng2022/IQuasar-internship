      A questionnaire based study to investigate the effectiveness of an Augmented Reality App in&#xD;
      the selection of teeth for dentures. Patients dentists and dental technicians are asked to&#xD;
      assess the effectiveness of the App in structured questionnaires.&#xD;

      Background The selection of teeth for dentures has difficulties. The main problem is that&#xD;
      patients find it hard to envisage how a particular shape or 'mold' of tooth will look in&#xD;
      their mouth. They are currently shown a number of different shaped teeth asked to express&#xD;
      their preference.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This research team has developed computer software which now offers an alternative way to&#xD;
      assist patients in the selection of the different shaped teeth. The new method uses&#xD;
      'Augmented Reality' (AR) to show the patient a live image of themselves with a selection of&#xD;
      teeth in position in the picture. Effectively the patient takes a live video 'selfie' and the&#xD;
      image on the screen shows the chosen teeth in their smile. The investigators want to know if&#xD;
      this new method of selection improves the process of tooth selection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigation Design This is a prospective observational cohort study which follows selected&#xD;
      patients over 2 clinical visits carrying out a questionnaire based investigation of the new&#xD;
      Augmented Reality (AR) method to select teeth for dentures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives This aim of this research is to investigate the effectiveness of the technology.&#xD;
      This will be undertaken using 5 questionnaire based outcome measures to be completed by&#xD;
      patients, dentists and dental technicians.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objective The primary objective is to assess the use of Augmented Reality (AR) for&#xD;
      tooth selection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objectives use structured questionnaires to determine:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. the patients' assessment of using the Augmented Reality (AR) for tooth selection.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. the clinicians' assessment of using the Augmented Reality (AR) for tooth selection&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. the dental technicians assessment of using Augmented Reality (AR) for tooth selection&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. the clinicians' assessment of the quality and reality of the images produced by the&#xD;
           Augmented Reality (AR) for tooth selection&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. the dentists' assessment of the quality and reality of the images produced by Augmented&#xD;
           Reality (AR) for tooth selection&#xD;
&#xD;
      Number of Patients 30 patients will be recruited&#xD;
&#xD;
      Informed Consent Witten Informed consent will be obtained from each participant.&#xD;
