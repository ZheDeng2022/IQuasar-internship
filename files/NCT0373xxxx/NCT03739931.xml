  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The clinical study will assess the safety and tolerability of escalating intratumoral doses&#xD;
      of mRNA-2752 in participants with relapsed/refractory solid tumor malignancies or lymphoma.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1, open-label, multicenter, dose-escalation study of intratumoral injections&#xD;
      of mRNA-2752 alone and in combination with intravenously administered immune checkpoint&#xD;
      blockade therapy in participants with histologically confirmed advanced or metastatic solid&#xD;
      tumor malignancies or lymphoma. The study consists of Dose Escalation and Dose Confirmation&#xD;
      Parts, which will occur in Arm A and Arm B, followed by a Dose Expansion Part, which will&#xD;
      occur in Arm B, and a Dose Exploration in Arm C as a neoadjuvant therapy for cutaneous&#xD;
      melanoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants in Arm A and in Arm B will be enrolled into the Dose Escalation Part and the&#xD;
      doses of mRNA-2752 will be administered in a dose escalation regimen until a maximum&#xD;
      tolerated dose (MTD) or a recommended dose for expansion (RDE) is identified. When the&#xD;
      MTD/RDE is identified, participants with solid tumors or lymphoma with visceral lesions may&#xD;
      be enrolled into the Dose Confirmation Part to confirm that the dose is also appropriate for&#xD;
      this subgroup.&#xD;
