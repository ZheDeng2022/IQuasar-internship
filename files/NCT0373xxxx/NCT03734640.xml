      OPTIMISTmain is an investigator-initiated and conducted, international, multicentre, stepped&#xD;
      wedge cluster randomized controlled trial comparing the effects of different intensities of&#xD;
      nursing care monitoring for patients with acute ischemic stroke of mild severity and without&#xD;
      critical care needs after IV-tPA.&#xD;

      Research question: Patients receiving thrombolytic therapy (tissue plasminogen activator&#xD;
      [tPA]) for acute ischaemic stroke (AIS), have been monitored with a high intensity schedule&#xD;
      of vital signs and neurologic assessments, which often requires 1:1 nursing and/or admission&#xD;
      in an intensive care unit (ICU) or similar ward for at least 24 hours after receiving tPA.&#xD;
      Studies indicate that patients with mild degrees of AIS after tPA do not require such&#xD;
      intensive monitoring, yet most stroke services continue to follow a practice recommended in&#xD;
      guidelines based on the initial cautious evaluation of tPA in AIS over 20 years ago.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: Stepped-wedge cluster randomised design. With 3 groups and 4 phases. All groups&#xD;
      starting with standard care and in each subsequent phase, groups I through III will switch to&#xD;
      the intervention (low-intensity monitoring).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study centers: This is a global study. Approximately 157 hospitals ('sites') in Australasia,&#xD;
      Europe, South American, and North American regions, who are willing to accept the randomized&#xD;
      intervention change and adhere to the protocol, collect a required minimum data set on&#xD;
      patients over 7 days in hospital (or discharge or death, if sooner), and record any serious&#xD;
      adverse event (SAE) during and at clinical outcome assessed at 90 days of follow-up of&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Consent/randomization: Hospitals will be eligible if they are using the proposed&#xD;
      low-intensity nursing monitoring strategy. A stepped-wedge cluster randomized design has been&#xD;
      chosen to avoid contamination, facilitate hospital-wide implementation, and maximize&#xD;
      adherence, as the intervention under investigation is to become usual standard of care. The&#xD;
      process of one direction (from control to intervention) is to facilitate the low intensity&#xD;
      monitoring protocol being applied in clinical practice. The stepped-wedge design means that&#xD;
      all hospitals will be randomly allocated to 3 groups: in phase 1, all hospitals will be&#xD;
      observed under standard care 'control' conditions according to guideline recommended&#xD;
      monitoring; in phase 2, the first cluster of hospitals (Group I) will start receiving the&#xD;
      intervention (low-intensity), and then sequentially, Groups II and III will start receiving&#xD;
      the interventional package in phase 3 and 4, respectively, so that by phase 4, all hospitals&#xD;
      will have the intervention. Those hospitals in Group I are exposed to the intervention for&#xD;
      longest time, and those in Group III, the shortest time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In each phase, hospitals are to maintain a register of all thrombolyzed AIS patients, and to&#xD;
      identify all those eligible for, or excluded from participating in the study. Hospitals are&#xD;
      required to manage at minimum target of at least 10 consecutive thrombolyzed AIS patients who&#xD;
      fulfill the eligibility criteria (presumed 50% of all thrombolyzed AIS patients) over each 4&#xD;
      month period. The recruitment number will vary from 10 to 30 patients, according to seasonal&#xD;
      fluctuation and overall numbers of thrombolyzed AIS patients across hospitals. The target&#xD;
      number and time limits for each phase will be pre-determined and agreed to with each&#xD;
      hospital, to ensure an orderly completion of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On average, for Group I, the time for initiation of the low-intensive intervention is 4&#xD;
      months after activation into phase 1 of the study; for Groups II and III, the time periods&#xD;
      for initiation of the low-intensive intervention are 6 and 9 months, after activation,&#xD;
      respectively. Data collection will occur at baseline, the first 24 hours, Day 7 (or death or&#xD;
      time of hospital discharge, if earlier), and at 90 days (end of follow-up). Patients will be&#xD;
      asked to consent to being contacted at some future date to examine long-term outcomes,&#xD;
      according to available resources.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A senior executive officer at each center will act as a 'guardian', to provide consent at an&#xD;
      institutional level for the intervention to be applied as a 'low risk' intervention to&#xD;
      clusters of patients as part of routine care; and written informed consent is to be&#xD;
      subsequently obtained from participants, or their approved surrogates, for collection of&#xD;
      medical data and participation in the follow-up assessments Randomized allocation of&#xD;
      intervention will be assigned by a statistician not otherwise involved in the study according&#xD;
      to a statistical program stratified by the country of the site.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size: The sample size required to detect a plausible treatment effect on a clinical&#xD;
      outcome in a stepped-wedge trial (3 groups, 4 phases) is 157 hospitals, each recruiting an&#xD;
      average of 80 patients (20 per phase), for a total of 12,394 AIS patients. The basis of this&#xD;
      calculation is that the study is designed with 90% power (one-sided α = 0.025) to detect&#xD;
      non-inferiority (non-inferiority OR margin is 1.25, presumed actual OR is 1.0; the proportion&#xD;
      of a bad outcome [mRS 2-6] is 50%) of low-intensity monitoring on the primary outcome.&#xD;
      Assuming a stepped-wedge trial of 3 groups and 4 phases, 157 hospitals are required to be&#xD;
      randomized into 3 groups of 53 hospitals, each recruiting an average of 16 patients per&#xD;
      phase, for a total of 9340 subjects. Assuming 10% with missing primary endpoint data and 5%&#xD;
      with nonadherence to randomized treatment, the overall sample size increases to an average of&#xD;
      20 subjects per hospital per phase (i.e. total sample size of 12,394 AIS patients). Allowance&#xD;
      will be made to include some very large hospitals (10%, 7) to recruit 50 patients per phase,&#xD;
      and smaller hospitals (10%, 7) to recruit 8 patients per phase, in order to allow a broad&#xD;
      range of hospitals with variable experience and systems of care for the management of AIS.&#xD;
