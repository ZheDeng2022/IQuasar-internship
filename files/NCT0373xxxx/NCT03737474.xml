    <description>The incidence of the following events will be summarized:&#xD;
•Adverse events occurring after initiation of Interventional Medicinal Product administration</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Mean changes from baseline in Montgomery Åsberg Depression Rating Scale（MADRS) at Week 52.</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 52</time_frame>
    <description>The proportion of subjects who decrease MADRS total scores more than 50%. Reaction Rate and Remission Rate.The MADRS consists of 10 items assessing apparent sadness, reported sadness, inner tension, reduced sleep, reduced appetite, concentration difficulties, lassitude, inability to feel, pessimistic thoughts, suicidal thought. Each item is scored from 0 to 6, with higher scores indicating worse condition.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>

    <measure>The proportion of subjects who score 1 or 2 on the Clinical Global Impression-Improvement(CGI-I) scale at Week 52</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 52</time_frame>
    <description>The CGI-I Scale is a clinician-rated scale which assesses the total improvement of the patient's condition compared to that at baseline. Scores range from 0 to 7: 0 = Not assessed, 1= Very much improved, 2 = Much improved, 3= Minimally improved, 4= No change, 5= Minimally worse, 6= Much worse, 7= Very much worse. Higher scores indicate worse condition.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Mean changes from baseline in Clinical Global Impression-Severity of illness(CGI-S) at Week 52</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 52</time_frame>
    <description>The CGI-S Scale is a clinician-rated scale which assesses how mentally ill the patient is at the time. Scores range from 0 to 7: 0 = Not assessed, 1= Normal, not at all ill, 2 =Borderline mentally ill, 3= Mildly ill, 4= Moderately ill, 5= Markedly ill, 6= Severely ill, 7= Among the most extremely ill patients. Higher scores indicate worse condition.</description>

    <measure>Mean changes from baseline in Hamiliton Depression Rating Scale(HAM-D) item total scores at Week 52</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 52</time_frame>
    <description>The HAM-D is a clinician-rated scale which evaluates the level of depression. The HAM-D consists of 17 items such as depression mood, feeling of guilt, suicide, insomnia, work and activities, retardation, and so on. Each item is scored from 0 to 2, 3 or 4, with higher scores indicating worse condition. Summed subscales are combined to compute a total score. Total score ranges from 0 to 53 , with higher score indicating worse condition.</description>

    <measure>Mean changes from baseline in Sheehan Disability Scale (SDS) scores at Week 52</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 52</time_frame>
    <description>SDS Scale is a patient-rated scale which assesses the degree of impairment for each of 3 items (&quot;work/school,&quot; &quot;social life,&quot; and &quot;family life/home responsibilities&quot;) on a 11-point scale ranging from 0 to 10 and the number of &quot;days lost&quot; and &quot;days unproductive&quot; caused by in the past week.</description>
