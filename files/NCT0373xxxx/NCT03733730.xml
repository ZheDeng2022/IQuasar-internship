      This is a prospective, multicenter, post-approval active surveillance study. The purpose of&#xD;
      this study is to report the rate of post-surgical intraocular inflammation (based upon a&#xD;
      specified case definition) reported within a 180-day post-surgical period following attempted&#xD;
      implantation of an ACRYSOF IQ RESTOR Toric or ACRYSOF IQ RESTOR IOL in the US.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      If a second eye will participate in the study, subjects will receive the second eye cataract&#xD;
      surgery within 60 days of the screening Visit 0. Four postoperative follow-up visits are&#xD;
      planned to occur at 1-2 days, 7-14 days, 30-60 days, and 90-180 days, for each enrolled eye.&#xD;
      Subject participation in this study is expected to last up to 7 months, including a total of&#xD;
      6 study visits for subjects implanted in one eye and up to 11 visits for subjects implanted&#xD;
      in both eyes. Upon completion of the 180 days follow-up visit, subjects will be exited from&#xD;
      the study.&#xD;

    <description>Post-surgical intraocular inflammation is defined as exacerbated intraocular inflammation within 180 days after IOL implantation, indicated by ≥ 3+ aqueous cell within the first 14 days post-operative, and/or ≥ 2+ aqueous cell ˃ 14 days and ≤ 60 days post-operative, and/or ≥ 1+ aqueous cell ˃ 60 days post-operatively or later.

    <description>Uncategorized post-surgical intraocular inflammation is defined as signs of exacerbated intraocular inflammation within 180 days after IOL implantation associated with t he following findings that do not fall in the given category of TASS, Acute Postoperative Endophthalmitis, or Chronic Postoperative Endophthalmitis: ≥ 3+ aqueous cell within the first 14 days post-op, and/or ≥ 2+ aqueous cell ˃ 14 days and ≤ 60 days post-op, and/or ≥ 1+ aqueous cell ˃ 60 days post-operatlvely or later.
