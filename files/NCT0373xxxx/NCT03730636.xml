  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The duration of antibiotic (ATB) therapy in late onset sepsis (LOS) of the neonate is&#xD;
      currently not based on scientific data. The current PROABIS trial will study the use of a&#xD;
      biological marker, procalcitonin (PCT), to guide ATB therapy duration in neonates with LOS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our hypothesis is that the use of procalcitonin guidance can reduce of 30% the duration of&#xD;
      ATB treatment without increasing recurrence of infection and mortality.&#xD;

      Randomized controlled multicenter open trial comparing the efficacy of PCT guided strategy&#xD;
      (superiority aspect) and safety (non-inferiority aspect) versus usual strategy in LOS of the&#xD;
      neonate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After inclusion, patients are randomly assigned (in a 1:1 ratio) to duration of ATB therapy&#xD;
      according to PCT guidance (experimental group) or to standard of care (control group).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experimental group:&#xD;
&#xD;
      For patients randomly assigned in the PCT-guided group, a PCT concentration is measured at D0&#xD;
      (randomisation), at D2 and then, every two days until PCT value is equal or below 0.5 ng/mL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The physician in charge of the neonate will be strongly encouraged to stop ATB treatment as&#xD;
      soon as the PCT value is equal or below 0.5 ng/mL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Control group:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the control group, management of LOS and treatment are based on the attending clinician's&#xD;
      practice and according to the usual practice (No PCT dosage).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In both groups data will be collected at the follow-up visit (day 14±2 after randomization)&#xD;
      or the day of discharge from the hospital (if before 14±2 days) and at the end of the study&#xD;
      visit (day 28± 2 after randomization) In case of transfer to another service or hospital or&#xD;
      known re hospitalization before day28, outcomes will be collected from the service receiving&#xD;
      the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A phone call will be made to the parents, only in case of discharge before 28 days. following&#xD;
      randomization. This phone call will be made 28± 2 days after randomization to identify&#xD;
      adverse outcomes.&#xD;
