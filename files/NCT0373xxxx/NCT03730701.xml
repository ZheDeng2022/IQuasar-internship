    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the feasibility and effect of an ongoing digital,&#xD;
      person-centered stroke prevention program with a focus on primary prevention. The program is&#xD;
      aiming to enable lifestyle change and to promote healthy activity patterns to decrease risk&#xD;
      factors for stroke and in that way prevent future stroke.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is a randomized controlled pilot study evaluating the feasibility and effect of an&#xD;
      ongoing digital augmented person-centered stroke prevention program with a focus on primary&#xD;
      prevention. The program is aiming to enable lifestyle change and to promote healthy activity&#xD;
      patterns to decrease risk factors for stroke and in that way prevent future stroke. With&#xD;
      activity patterns (individual actions and behaviour) in everyday life we mean a persons&#xD;
      overall lifestyle that may or may not contribute to health.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The prevention program is a theoretically grounded, complex intervention tested against a&#xD;
      controll-group that are reciving usual care. The prevention program is based on activities in&#xD;
      people's everyday lives and integrates health and well-being with what people do, as well as&#xD;
      with what they want or need to do, in order to thrive and live well. Lifestyle change refers&#xD;
      to a conscious change of behaviour and everyday activities in order to promote health. The&#xD;
      process of changing behaviour results from an interaction between the person (eg,&#xD;
      self-efficacy), the environment (support and material) and the action. In the project, the&#xD;
      key behavioural change technique is incorporating engaging everyday activities (EEAs) that&#xD;
      contribute to a healthy lifestyle. This might include changing the form of current EEAs or&#xD;
      finding new health-promoting EEAs.&#xD;

Three colums with different colours. Red, yellow and green. Red is High risk, Yellow is Caution, and Green is Low risk. In total there is 8 points per column.&#xD;
High risk: &gt;3 red points: Ask about stroke prevention right away. Caution: 4-6: A good start. Work on reducing risk. Low risk: 6-8: You're doing very well at controlling stroke risk.</description>
