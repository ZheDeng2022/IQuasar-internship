  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase 1 open label study to evaluate the dose, safety and tolerability of an IP&#xD;
      α-emitting radionuclide therapy (Radspherin®) in subjects with peritoneal carcinomatosis (PC)&#xD;
      from colorectal carcinoma following complete CRS (cytoreduction score CC-0) and HIPEC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study consists of three different cohorts:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Dose escalation cohorts (Phase 1a)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Repeated injection cohorts (Phase 1b)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Expansion cohort&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Primary objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To investigate safety and toxicity of Radspherin®&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the maximum-tolerated dose (MTD) of Radspherin®, among the four suggested&#xD;
           doses 1, 2, 4 and 7 MBq, as a single intraperitoneal (IP) injection and two repeated IP&#xD;
           injections following cytoreductive surgery (CRS) and hyperthermic IP chemotherapy&#xD;
           (HIPEC)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To establish a recommended dose of Radspherin® as a single IP injection and two repeated&#xD;
           IP injections following CRS and HIPEC&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To describe the biodistribution of Radspherin®&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To examine the efficacy and clinical benefit of Radspherin® following CRS and HIPEC&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exploratory objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To explore the association of biomarkers with activity/clinical benefits, adverse events&#xD;
           (AEs), or other effects associated with Radspherin®&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To explore effects of catheter placement, Radspherin® administration technique, and&#xD;
           infusion volume on the distribution of 224Ra labelled micro particles in the peritoneal&#xD;
           cavity&#xD;
&#xD;
      The maximum number of subjects receiving Radspherin® in this study is 39. Subjects who&#xD;
      discontinue prior to Radspherin® administration will be replaced.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dose escalation cohorts (Phase 1a): 3 - 24 subjects Repeated injection cohorts (Phase 1b): 3&#xD;
      - 9 subjects Expansion cohort: 6 subjects&#xD;
