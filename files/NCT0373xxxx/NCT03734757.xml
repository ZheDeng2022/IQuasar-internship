  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The initial staging of locally advanced prostate cancer is made with Computed Tomography scan&#xD;
      (CT), Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), and bone scan (BS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      For this type of cancer, reference treatment is radiotherapy combined with hormone therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The added value of MRI in the delineation of volumes for radiotherapy is known, especially&#xD;
      for the definition of extra-prostatic extensions and prostatic apex. However, its regular use&#xD;
      is difficult. Indeed, acquisition of Magnetic Resonance Imaging parameters for diagnostic are&#xD;
      not adapted to be fused with the planning Computed Tomography.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The literature shows that Positron Emission Tomography-Computed Tomography with Fluorocholine&#xD;
      is better in terms of diagnostic performance compared to bone scan for bone metastases and to&#xD;
      pelvic Magnetic Resonance Imaging for nodal extension.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It would therefore improve staging for these patients with a high risk of locoregional and&#xD;
      metastatic invasion even if its use is currently not recommended in the initial staging.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thanks to Magnetic Resonance Imaging acquisition parameters adapted to Radiotherapy and&#xD;
      additional functional information, an acquisition in tri-modality Positron Emission&#xD;
      Tomography/computed Tomography/ Magnetic Resonance Imaging could have an impact on the&#xD;
      volumes definition for radiotherapy or even on the therapeutic strategy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the study is to evaluate the volume modifications obtained on the trimodality&#xD;
      evaluation, compared to the standard initial staging (geometric comparison).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, it would be a preliminary study for a project using Prostate-specific membrane&#xD;
      antigen (PSMA) in trimodality, and / or for a therapeutic interventional study.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Prostate cancer (Pca) is the first human cancer in terms of incidence and the third leading&#xD;
      cause of tumor death (56,000 new cases/year in France in 2012 and nearly 9,000 deaths).&#xD;
      According to the French Association of Urology 2013, an individual screening based on rectal&#xD;
      examination and prostatic specific antigen (PSA) is recommended for men over 50. Ultrasound&#xD;
      (US) guided biopsy allows the histological diagnosis and the Gleason score evaluation. For&#xD;
      high-risk of prostate Cancer, initial staging is based on pelvic Magnetic Resonance Imaging,&#xD;
      abdominal pelvic computed tomography and bone scan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      External radiotherapy combined with prolonged hormone therapy is the reference treatment for&#xD;
      these cancers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Radiotherapy requires a planning Computed Tomography. Magnetic Resonance Imaging is known to&#xD;
      be better for definition of extra-prostatic extensions and prostatic apex. However, its&#xD;
      regular use is difficult for the radiotherapy planning.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Moreover, Positron Emission Tomography-Computed Tomography with Fluorocholine detects earlier&#xD;
      nodal and bone metastasis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: A single planning acquisition in trimodality in radiotherapy position should&#xD;
      improve simultaneously the initial staging and the volume delineation for radiotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main objective: Main objective is to compare volumes delineation (prostatic target and organ&#xD;
      at risk) thanks to geometric index (Jaccard, Dice and overlap), got by trimodality and by&#xD;
      standard initial staging and planning Computed Tomography.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expected results: Thanks to literature data, it can be expected that prostatic delineation&#xD;
      target volume will significantly decrease with Magnetic Resonance Imaging.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Furthermore, thanks to Positron Emission Tomography-Computed Tomography with Fluorocholine,&#xD;
      radiotherapy planning would be different, detecting 14% of nodal extension and 7% of bone&#xD;
      metastasis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Finally, with trimodality the investigators expect a smaller prostate volume and a higher&#xD;
      detection of metastatic lymph node or bone metastasis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Then, the investigators expect an improvement of the management of patients by:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Detecting more nodal or bone metastasis and avoiding a useless local treatment by&#xD;
           radiotherapy&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Improving prostatic target volume delineation and allowing a better protection of organ&#xD;
           at risk.&#xD;
