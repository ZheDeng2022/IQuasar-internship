      Background: This study aims to obtain the most favorable syringe and needle combination,&#xD;
      which causes the least pain during local anesthesia tumescent injection in the simulation of&#xD;
      fully awake hand surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: A randomized single-blinded controlled trial is designed for 30 adult male healthy&#xD;
      subjects to compare the pain from injection using syringe and needle combination i.e. 1) 1 cc&#xD;
      syringe with 26G needle, 2) 3 cc syringe with 26 G needle, and 3) 5 cc needle with 26 G&#xD;
      needle. The injection will be performed in any of at the second, third and fourth fingers of&#xD;
      either subject's hand randomly. The injection will be SIMPLE block technique using 1 cc of&#xD;
      NaCl 0.9% solution under the injection speed of 30 seconds/cc. Subjects are required to rate&#xD;
      two check-point of VAS at the timing of needle puncture and just right after the completion&#xD;
      of the infiltration. Upon the completion of each finger, the subject is also asked to give&#xD;
      response to seri of questions regarding the procedures and their preferences. At the end of&#xD;
      all injections, subject is asked to rate his preference of syringe and needle combination.&#xD;

      METHODS&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.1 DESIGN This is a randomized, single-blinded controlled trial to measure local pain&#xD;
      following local anesthesia tumescent injection using a different combination of syringe and&#xD;
      needle in a healthy volunteer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.2 TIME AND PLACE The study will be conducted at Cipto Mangunkusumo Hospital (RSCM) in&#xD;
      February to March 2018&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.3 SAMPLE 30 male healthy subjects (aged 18-60 years) who volunteer to join this study and&#xD;
      meet the inclusion criteria are going to be selected with the convenient sampling method&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.4 SAMPLE SIZE Sample size for pilot study are used. The expected sample size is between&#xD;
      10-40 per groups, therefore we choose 30 subjects (90 fingers tested) to be included into 3&#xD;
      different treatment group&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.5 INCLUSION AND EXCLUSION CRITERIA As for the trial, we will include subjects who are&#xD;
      healthy in general, male and aged 18 to 60 years old. However, we also plan to exclude&#xD;
      subjects with history of blood or coagulation disorder, history of neuro vasculopathy,&#xD;
      history of liver and renal disease, currently active smoker or already stopped less than 1&#xD;
      month, had previous injury or surgery in hand, or hand scar detected, history of Raynaud's&#xD;
      phenomenon, history of vasospastic disorders, history of scleroderma, history of Buerger's&#xD;
      disease, history of Dupuytren's disease, and history of complex regional pain syndrome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.6 SUBJECTS ENROLLMENT Sampling method used are convenient method&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.7 METHODS Healthy subjects who met the inclusion criteria are included in the study.&#xD;
      Subjects are given explanations about the research and are requested to sign the informed&#xD;
      consent form, should they agree to join the study. Each subject will be assigned to three&#xD;
      injections using different combination of syringe and needle: 1. 1 cc syringe with 26 G&#xD;
      needle, 2. 3 cc syringe with 26 G needle and 3. 5 cc needle with 26 G needle. The injection&#xD;
      will be randomized to take place in any of at the second, third and fourth fingers of both&#xD;
      hands. Once one side is injected, the subject is asked to introduce the second hand, and for&#xD;
      the third injection, the hand is changed again. No washout periods are intentionally given&#xD;
      between needles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Every subject is randomized into treatment of sequence using digital random generator from&#xD;
      www.randomizer.org. The first sequence for randomization is syringe choice, (code 1cc =1, 3&#xD;
      cc= 2., 5cc=3) randomized for 30 sets, with no repetition. The second sequence for&#xD;
      randomization is the hand choice (left hand=1, right hand=2) randomized for 30 sets, with&#xD;
      repetition. The third sequence for randomization is the finger choice for either hand (2nd&#xD;
      finger=1, 3rd finger=2, 4th finger=3) randomized for 30 sets, with repetition. The example&#xD;
      for subject randomization table are shown at APPENDICES.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The injection technique used is SIMPLE block. A SIMPLE block is a block technique using&#xD;
      infiltration where the point of needle injection is at the digitopalmar crease at its&#xD;
      mid-axis. The tumescent solution used is Normal Saline (NaCl 0.9%), the amount of solution is&#xD;
      one cc for each finger. We do not use lidocaine or anesthetic agents to avoid the bias of&#xD;
      reduced pain along the course of injection. The rates of injection of each finger are 30&#xD;
      seconds (slow infusion) to inject all one cc of tumescent solution subcutaneously, regardless&#xD;
      of syringe-needle combinations used. The metronome with the rate of 120 BPM is used so that&#xD;
      the injection rate is constant along 30 s period. The metronome was used using headphone in&#xD;
      injector ear, to avoid bias and creating anxiety to the subjects. The senior author (T.O.H.P)&#xD;
      will perform all injection, and are given three pieces of paper before ever injection, to&#xD;
      silently give information on tumescent technique, fingers sequence, syringe-needle&#xD;
      combinations sequence and the solution used. Subjects are seated comfortably, behind a screen&#xD;
      with a small opening large enough to introduce the tested hand. Both hands are placed on the&#xD;
      supine position on the table. Seating positions and hand positions are designed somewhat&#xD;
      ergonomics and comfort, to avoid creating bias due to positional discomfort. They could not&#xD;
      see any of the procedure and won't know which syringe-needle combinations is used. The&#xD;
      ambiance of procedure's room is situated to be silent, no music or unnecessary sounds are&#xD;
      made. Subjects are actively communicated of what treatment is coming next during the&#xD;
      procedures, so the readiness of subjects is precipitated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A baseline subjective pain was marked by the subject using VAS, with the pain score from&#xD;
      1-10, 1 (very mild pain) to 10 (worst pain ever). VAS chart along with description placed on&#xD;
      the table within subject's visual field. Pen are prepared so the subjects could mark their&#xD;
      VAS score on the chart, with non-injected hand, when asked by operator. Its ensured that&#xD;
      operator don't know the score when VAS noted to avoid bias. The person in charge of&#xD;
      randomization prepared the syringe-needle combinations and solution as stated in the&#xD;
      envelope. He/she also note the VAS score during all the injection and distribute the&#xD;
      questionnaire after each injection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The region of injection was sterilized with 70 % alcohol, and a waiting duration of 30 s was&#xD;
      provided for total evaporation. The point needle insertion is at digitopalmar crease at its&#xD;
      mid-axis at selected fingers. The procedure initiated by pinching the needle insertion point&#xD;
      using operator fingers to create the tactile distraction, pinching is maintained for 10&#xD;
      seconds. Then the needle inserted in a perpendicular fashion (90 degrees to the skin&#xD;
      surface), needles are proceeded down subcutaneously just beneath the dermis. Patient is asked&#xD;
      the VAS score at this point (Check-point 1-needle prick). After the needles inserted&#xD;
      subcutaneously, 30 second period of waiting is given to let the patient adapt to the needle&#xD;
      prick pain. After 30 seconds, the infiltration of the tumescent solution is initiated. All&#xD;
      one cc of the tumescent solution is infiltrated into the tissues within 30 seconds regardless&#xD;
      of the syringe size, metronome with 120 bpm are used to control the rate. Two check-point of&#xD;
      VAS are noted: the first initial injection and just after the completion of the infiltration.&#xD;
      For all injections, the needle was kept subcutaneous for whole procedures with great care to&#xD;
      stand still and minimize movement. Fresh needles are used when moving from one finger to the&#xD;
      other fingers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Upon the completion of each fingers, the subject is asked to give answer to series of a&#xD;
      question regarding the procedures and their preferences. The answer given is written by&#xD;
      giving only checks or cross on the question papers, so that patient can use any hand to write&#xD;
      the answer with ease. Thus, these moments also could give some washout period for pain from&#xD;
      the injected hand before. At the end of all injections, subjects are asked which combinations&#xD;
      of syringe and needle they are preferred. The subjects were provided with four tablets of&#xD;
      paracetamol 500 mg after the whole injection for they to take in case he suffers persistent&#xD;
      pain. Subjects are asked to contact the researchers if pain persists or any adverse event&#xD;
      occurred.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Some parameters, which will be recorded and documented are: 1. Pain scale using VAS during&#xD;
      three checkpoints which are initial needle prick, initial infiltration of tumescent injection&#xD;
      and after the infiltration finished, 2. Patient responses and preference regarding the&#xD;
      procedures using questionnaire and 3. Patient preference of combinations of syringe and&#xD;
      needle&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.8 VARIABLE The research design includes several independent variables to be tested such as:&#xD;
      1 cc syringe with 26 G needle, 3 cc syringe with 26 G needle and 5 cc needle with 26 G&#xD;
      needle, tumescent solution used which is 1 cc NaCl 0.9% and finally the 3 choices of finger&#xD;
      to be injected which are selected between 2nd, 3rd or 4th finger on both hands. The dependent&#xD;
      variable in this study that will be analyzed are VAS score during three checkpoints; the&#xD;
      initial needle prick, the initial infiltration of tumescent injection, and after all the&#xD;
      infiltration finished, the patient preference and responses in patient preference&#xD;
      questionnaire are also tested, along with the patient choices of injections kits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.9 OPERATIONAL DEFINITION&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  2nd finger: index finger in either hand&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  3rd finger: long finger in either hand&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  4th finger: ring finger in either hand&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  SIMPLE finger block is a block technique using infiltration where the point of needle&#xD;
           injection is at the digitopalmar crease at its mid-axis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Tumescent solution: The solution injected to finger during anesthesia, here we use&#xD;
           Normal Saline (NaCl 0.9%) only. The amount of solution is 1 cc for each finger.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Rates of injection: the speed or time required to inject all solution in the syringe to&#xD;
           fingers&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) a subjective measure of pain that consist of a 10-cm&#xD;
           line with two end-point representing &quot;no pain&quot; and &quot;worst pain imaginable.&quot; Subjects&#xD;
           were asked to rate their pain by placing mark on the line corresponding to their current&#xD;
           level of pain. The length along the line from &quot;no pain&quot; marker was then measured with a&#xD;
           ruler giving a pain score out of 10. The VAS chart is translated into Bahasa Indonesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  1 cc syringe: in this research, we are using 1 cc syringe produced by Terumo® (Terumo&#xD;
           Corporation; Tokyo, Japan)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  3 cc syringe: in this research, we are using 3 cc syringe produced by Terumo®&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  5 cc syringe: in this research, we are using 5 cc syringe produced by Terumo®&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  26-gauge needle: in this research, we are using 27-gauge needle produced by Terumo®&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Questionnaire: series of questionnaire asked after each injection procedure to assess&#xD;
           patient preferences and responses. The questionnaire is translated into Bahasa&#xD;
           Indonesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.10 DATA ANALYSIS In this research, data processing is performed using an SPSS version 22.0&#xD;
      software. We assume that variance for each finger injected is the same (no significance&#xD;
      difference). For VAS score data is presented a table and graphic form of the mean and&#xD;
      standard deviation for numerical data, and with normal distribution and median. Minimum and&#xD;
      maximum for numerical data with abnormal distribution. An ANOVA test analysis were used if&#xD;
      the distribution is normal, Kruskall Wallis test analysis is used if the distribution is not&#xD;
      normal, to assess the significance of three combinations of syringe and needle and VAS. The&#xD;
      response for questionnaire also analyzed for their correlation with syringe used using chi&#xD;
      square test. The significance level was set at P&lt;0.05 with Confidence Interval 95%.&#xD;
