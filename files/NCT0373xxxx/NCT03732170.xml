  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study design is a double blinded randomized controlled trial and 170 subjects (teeth) ,&#xD;
      85 in each of the 2 groups, will be enrolled from the patients at the NUH dental centre&#xD;
      endodontic unit. The study aims to assess how the use of TotalFill® bioceramic sealer affects&#xD;
      the healing outcome of apical periodontitis compared to a control AH plus®.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Conventional root canal treatment will be done during this study. Radiographs will be taken&#xD;
      at each study visit during the study for root canal. The preoperative, postoperative and&#xD;
      review clinical and radiographic data will be analysed.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Randomization and Blinding Study subject (tooth) will be randomized in a 1:1 allocation ratio&#xD;
      between the two treatment groups. Allocation will be by random permuted block and stratified&#xD;
      by gender to enhance balance. Computer generated randomized allocation for each subject will&#xD;
      be concealed in opaque envelope. The envelope will only be opened by the operator on the&#xD;
      obturation visit of the enrolled patient and the randomization number assigned to them.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the event that a patient has more than 1 tooth eligible for the study, only one tooth on&#xD;
      left and/or right side of the mouth will be recruited for the study. Therefore, a patient&#xD;
      could contribute a maximum of two teeth for this study (i.e. a maximum of one tooth on each&#xD;
      side of the mouth). Selection of tooth will be done using computer generated randomization&#xD;
      number.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Visits and Procedures After cleaning and shaping and the patients are deemed ready for&#xD;
      obturation, the patients will be randomly assigned to one of the 2 groups for obturation&#xD;
      using AH plus® or TotalFill® bioceramic sealer.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The patients and the examiners will be blinded to the type of sealer used but it would&#xD;
           not be possible to blind the operators.&#xD;
&#xD;
           b. Post Study Follow up and Procedures&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A follow up phone call will be made to collect the patient pain experience on day 1, day&#xD;
           3 and day 7 post treatment which they have recorded on their pain/discomfort diary.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  At the 6-month and 12-month review, patients will be examined for any clinical signs and&#xD;
           symptoms and a review radiograph will be taken to assess the size of the periapical&#xD;
           lesion.&#xD;
&#xD;
           c. Radiographic assessment&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  All radiographs will be taken with a localising device to control for angulation and&#xD;
           magnification.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Calibrated measurement tools in the dental practice management software will be used to&#xD;
           measure the diameter of the lesion across the longest diameter.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical and Analytical Plans&#xD;
&#xD;
      a. General Considerations Intention-to-treat population is considered the main analysis&#xD;
      population. The intention-to-treat population includes all subjects who were assigned a&#xD;
      randomization number. Study subject's demographic and pre-operative characteristics will be&#xD;
      summarized for each treatment group.&#xD;

    <description>Proportion z-test will be carried to compare the proportion of study subjects with improved apical lesion size between the two treatment groups. Odds ratio with 95% confidence interval will be reported.

    <description>Proportion z-test will be carried out. The odds ratio with a 95% confidence interval will be reported. A two-sample t-test will be performed to access the change in pain score (Pain was recorded as &quot;no pain&quot; (score = 0) or a 5-point Likert scale ranging from very mild pain (score = 1) to severe pain (score = 5)) at post-op compared with pre-op between the two treatment groups. Shapiro Wilk's test and Levene's test will be performed to check the normality and homogenous variance assumption of the two-sample t-test. Non-parametric approach (Mann-Whitney U-test) will be employed if there is significant violations of the normality assumption.</description>
