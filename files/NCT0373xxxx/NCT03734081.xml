  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study represents the first effort to prospectively investigate the Melcap's&#xD;
      bio-electrical ingestible ODC system in human. The study goal is to evaluate the safety and&#xD;
      feasibility of GES treatment in stomach and in the small and large bowel during and following&#xD;
      the ingestion of the bio-electrical capsule under tight and controlled conditions.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The problem of obesity in the adult population requires the exploration and development of&#xD;
      new, safe and effective therapies to combat increasing growth. A novel Implantable Gastric&#xD;
      Electrical Stimulation (GES), MEASTRO(R) Rechargeable System, has been recently approved by&#xD;
      the American Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use in weight reduction in patients aged&#xD;
      18 years through adulthood who have a Body Mass Index (BMI) of 40 to 45 kg/m2 with one or&#xD;
      more obesity related co-morbid conditions, and have failed at least one supervised management&#xD;
      program within the past 5 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Melcap System Ltd. has developed an innovative ingestible capsule system device that uses GES&#xD;
      for the treatment of overweight and obesity. The system is intended to suppress hunger,&#xD;
      reduce appetite, increase satiation and promote weight reduction in overweight and class I&#xD;
      obese adults who have a Body Mass Index of 27 kg/m2 to 34.9 kg/m2 with no related co-morbid&#xD;
      conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is a FIH prospective, open label, randomized study. It will include a 3 days&#xD;
      screening period and 4 days treatment session under a close supervision and follow up. Each&#xD;
      subject will ingest a total of 2 capsules (ODC) on the first and the third day of the study.&#xD;
      The total duration of subject participation including the termination visit will be eight&#xD;
      days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be conducted at a single medical center, Meir Hospital, Israel.&#xD;
