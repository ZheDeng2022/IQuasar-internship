  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC) is a widespread surgical procedure with superior outcomes&#xD;
      in terms of the incurred postoperative pain, recovery time, cosmetic, and morbidity issues.&#xD;
      Although it is associated with less postoperative pain compared to open cholecystectomy, but&#xD;
      patients still experience significant pain. Pain after LC is categorized into three types:&#xD;
      referred pain to the right shoulder due to diaphragmatic stretching during gas insufflation;&#xD;
      visceral pain due to dissection and injury at the hepatic fossa during gall bladder removal;&#xD;
      and somatic pain due to tissue injury at the port sites. Since the discovery of LC in 1987 by&#xD;
      a French surgeon, Phillipe Mouret, it became the gold standard for surgical excision of the&#xD;
      gallbladder. Local anesthetics (LA) has been tried for analgesia after LC in variable&#xD;
      techniques and concentrations. It was proved to be a safe and valid method for reducing pain&#xD;
      after LC instilled intraperitoneal and infiltrated at the port sites.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Surgicel is an absorbable gelatin sponge that is non-toxic, non-allergenic, non-immunogenic,&#xD;
      and non-pyrogenic. It is gamma-sterilized and provided with double packing. The sponge is&#xD;
      easily cut to fit the surgical cavity. It may be applied dry to the wound. It absorbs 40&#xD;
      times its weight of whole blood or 50 times of water and adheres easily to the bleeding site.&#xD;
      It forms a stable adherent coagulum. When implanted in vivo, it is completely absorbed within&#xD;
      3-5 weeks. The rationale for using this sponge as interposition material is to act as a&#xD;
      carrier for the analgesic drugs and allow for its local sustained release, and for local&#xD;
      hemostasis. Bupivacaine will be used as the main local anesthetic medication in the study. It&#xD;
      provides variable pain relief when either used to irrigate intraperitoneal space as a sole&#xD;
      analgesic or combined with opioids. Lidocaine 2% will be mixed with bupivacaine to expedite&#xD;
      the onset of analgesia. Epinephrine will be used as 5 microgram/ml of the total mixture of&#xD;
      used fluids in order to prolong the time of action of the block.&#xD;

      Eligibility and type of the study: This prospective randomized placebo-controlled&#xD;
      double-blind study will be conducted after approval from the Institutional Ethics Committee&#xD;
      and obtaining a written informed consent from patients undergoing elective laparoscopic&#xD;
      cholecystectomy under general anesthesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample Size: Sample size was calculated according to the previously conducted similar studies&#xD;
      in the same field. Based on a pilot study, where the incidence of postoperative pain after&#xD;
      laparoscopies was found to be more than 70% and intervention that can cause 50% reduction in&#xD;
      this incidence was required. With a power of 90% and type I error of 5%, 26 patients were&#xD;
      required to be in each group but to avoid possible patients dropouts, the number of patients&#xD;
      in each group is increased to 30 (total of 90 patients).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Drugs Coding and Randomization: Patients will be randomly allocated into three equal groups&#xD;
      (30 patients each) using a computer-generated table of random numbers in order to allocate&#xD;
      the patients into the three study groups. Neither the anesthesia provider nor the participant&#xD;
      will be aware of the study group or the drug used. One anesthesiologist (not included in the&#xD;
      procedure, observation or in the data collection) will prepare the study drugs. Two surgeons&#xD;
      with average similar level of experience in the field will operate upon patients sequentially&#xD;
      without a specific order. All patients will have full explanation about the anesthetic and&#xD;
      analgesic techniques they will have before signing their consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anesthesia Technique:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Before the day of the surgery, patients will visit the outpatient clinic for medical&#xD;
           assessment and description of the study protocol after securing their eligibility to&#xD;
           participate in the study. Laboratory investigations will be performed and patients will&#xD;
           sign the consent. All patients will receive the standard general anesthesia technique&#xD;
           followed in the hospital: preoperative 8 hours of NPO, premedication with proton pump&#xD;
           inhibitor and antiemetic.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  At operative theatre, patients will be connected to five standard monitoring measures:&#xD;
           electrocardiography (ECG), non-invasive blood pressure (NIBP), pulse oxymetry (SpO2),&#xD;
           core body temperature, and end-tidal carbon dioxide. An intravenous cannula 18G will be&#xD;
           inserted in the dorsum of the non-dominant hand and normal saline 0.9% IV fluids will be&#xD;
           infused at a rate of (6-8 ml/kg/h) throughout the surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  After 3 minutes of pre-oxygenation with 100% O2 via the appropriate size face mask,&#xD;
           general anesthesia will be induced with 1 Âµg/kg of fentanyl, 2-3 mg/kg of propofol,&#xD;
           cisatracurium (0.15 mg/kg). Patients will be intubated with an appropriate size cuffed&#xD;
           endotracheal tube under direct laryngoscopy after complete muscular relaxation.&#xD;
           Anesthesia will be maintained with sevoflurane at 2-3% MAC and cisatracurium 0.03 mg/kg.&#xD;
           Mechanical ventilation will be maintained and respiratory parameters will be adjusted to&#xD;
           keep the end-tidal CO2 at 35-45 mmHg. At the end of the surgery, residual neuromuscular&#xD;
           blockade will be pharmacologically reversed using neostigmine 0.04 mg/kg and atropine&#xD;
           0.02 mg/kg, and trachea will be extubated once the patient is showing clinical signs of&#xD;
           clearance from neuromuscular blockade and TOF ratio of 0.9 is achieved. In order to&#xD;
           control postoperative pain; the patients will receive I.V. paracetamol 1 gm (Perfalgan,&#xD;
           Paracetamol 1000 mg. UPSA laboratories, France).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Study Technique:&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the end of the operative procedure, the patient will have a cut piece of surgicel&#xD;
      folded, passed through the big port and intersected dry to cover the gallbladder bed area of&#xD;
      the hepatic fossa. The prepared study mixture of medicine will be 32 ml:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Instilled to soak the surgicel at the hepatic fossa (10 ml).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Splash the undersurface of the right copula of the diaphragm (10 ml).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Instilled to soak small pieces of surgicel intersected in the port areas (12 ml).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. First study group (LAM) will receive local anesthesia Bupivacaine 0.5% 20 ml (no more&#xD;
           than 2 mg/kg) plus lidocaine 2% 10 ml (no more than 3 mg/kg) mixed together, plus&#xD;
           epinephrine 5 mcg/ml (max 150 mcg), combined with morphine 0.1 mg/kg (max10 mg)&#xD;
           instilled into the assigned areas according to the technique.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Second study group (LAMG) will receive the same mixture in LAM-group to soak the&#xD;
           surgicel according to the previous planned technique&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Control group (CG) will receive normal saline 0.9% to soak the surgicel according to the&#xD;
           planned technique&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will be collected and analyzed by computer program SPSS (SPSS Inc., Chicago, Illinos,&#xD;
      USA) version 23. Data will be expressed as means, standard deviations, ranges, numbers and&#xD;
      percentages. The analysis of variance and Chi-square test will be used to assess that the&#xD;
      study groups are matched in terms of demographic data. Chi-Square or Fisher exact test will&#xD;
      be used to determine significance for categorical variables. T-test or Mann-Whitney test if&#xD;
      necessary will be used to determine significance for numeric variables. Kruskal-Wallis test&#xD;
      followed by the Wilcoxon matched pairs rank test; will be used specifically to compare VAS&#xD;
      and VRS. P value &lt;0.05 will be considered statistically significant.&#xD;
