  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study attempts to demonstrate improvement in analgesia in a more diverse laparoscopic&#xD;
      surgery group with the use of laparoscopic assisted transversus abdominis plane blocks. The&#xD;
      investigators will compare bupivacaine (treatment arm 1) versus liposomal bupivacaine&#xD;
      (treatment arm 2) versus port site injection of local anesthesia with injection of saline&#xD;
      placebo (control). The hypothesis is that liposomal bupivacaine will result in improved&#xD;
      analgesia when compared to bupivacaine LAPB and control. The investigators further&#xD;
      hypothesize that bupivacaine LAPB will be more effective than the control.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Patients will either be pre-screened prior to their pre-operative appointment for&#xD;
      eligibility, or screening will occur on the day of surgery. Informed Consent will be obtained&#xD;
      from amenable, eligible patients prior to their operation by a member of the research team. A&#xD;
      study number will be assigned, and the patient will be randomized to a treatment group. The&#xD;
      patients will not be aware to which treatment group they have been randomized.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After consent is obtained and randomization has been completed, the operating room registered&#xD;
      nurse will calculate maximum dose of allowable bupivacaine per patient based on body weight.&#xD;
      Anesthesia will provide the intravenous lidocaine bolus on induction to all patients without&#xD;
      a contraindication to the medication. The port placement will occur using a needle to raise&#xD;
      skin/preperitoneal wheal*. Up to 20cc of 1% lidocaine/epinephrine will be divided among all&#xD;
      ports and stab incisions. At end of case, no further skin or port-specific preperitoneal&#xD;
      anesthetic will be injected unless a skin incision was extended.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For patients randomized to port site injection (Control): 60 cc of sterile,&#xD;
      preservative-free, injectable saline will be given as a placebo per the protocol in item 6.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For patients randomized to bupivacaine plain LAPB (Treatment Arm 1): The maximum weight-based&#xD;
      dose of plain bupivacaine will be diluted with sterile, injectable, preservative-free saline&#xD;
      to a total of 60cc with a maximum of 250mg bupivacaine (regardless of weight) and loaded into&#xD;
      a 30cc syringe with a 22g spinal needle (one 30cc syringe used for each side).&#xD;
&#xD;
      For patients randomized to liposomal bupivacaine LAPB (Treatment Arm 2): The maximum dose for&#xD;
      adult patients is 266mg (20mL) of liposomal bupivacaine. This will be diluted with 40cc of&#xD;
      preservative-free normal saline for injection, per manufacturer recommendations. The solution&#xD;
      will then be loaded into a 30cc syringe with a 22g spinal needle and injected in the same&#xD;
      fashion as the bupivacaine plain LAPB.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection will include total doses of IV and skin and block anesthetic used, patient&#xD;
      weight, number and size of ports, if fascial closure of port site was conducted, and&#xD;
      post-operative narcotic medication used up to 48 hours with timing and doses marked, and use&#xD;
      of any pain adjuncts (nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs [NSAIDs], acetaminophen,&#xD;
      gabapentin, tricyclic antidepressants [TCA], pregabalin, clonidine, etc.) although doses of&#xD;
      these medications are not to be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Provision of home narcotic prescription will be based on a standardized protocol developed by&#xD;
      Dartmouth. Based on the past 24 hours of pain medication usage, patients will receive either&#xD;
      15 or 30 tablets of hydrocodone/acetaminophen 5/325mg (or liquid equivalent for bariatric&#xD;
      patients). Use of narcotic medications at home will be evaluated at 1 week post-procedure by&#xD;
      a member of the research team through a phone survey.&#xD;

    <description>Post-operative nausea will be quantified through chart review by recording the amount of anti-emetic medication administered in the 24 hour period the patient is admitted post-operatively.

    <description>Emesis is recorded as part of the standard intake/output medical charting, and the number of episodes of emesis will be quantified from chart review. This will be analyzed between groups to determine if the intervention has an impact on the number of episodes of post-operative emesis.</description>
