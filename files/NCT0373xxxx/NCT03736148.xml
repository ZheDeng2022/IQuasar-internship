  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the effects of manual and instrument-assisted cervical manipulation on&#xD;
      electromyographic activity and sympathetic nervous system. Subjects were divided in four&#xD;
      groups, one group was submitted to a manual cervical manipulation, other group was submitted&#xD;
      to an instrument-assisted cervical manipulation, other group was submitted to a sham&#xD;
      manipulation and another group served as control.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The manual manipulation was applied over C3/C4, as the participants were positioned in supine&#xD;
      with the cervical spine in a neutral position. Slight ipsilateral side flexion and&#xD;
      contralateral rotation were introduced until tension was perceived in the tissues at the&#xD;
      contact point. A high-velocity, low-amplitude thrust manipulation was directed upward and&#xD;
      medially in the direction of the subject's contralateral eye.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The instrument-assisted manipulation was applied using a handheld Activator IV Adjusting&#xD;
      Instrument. Contacts were made firm enough to prevent slipping of the rubber tip but not so&#xD;
      firm as to load the spring, in consistence with customary clinical use of the instrument. The&#xD;
      spring was then loaded by means of the instrument's trigger mechanism, and the impulse was&#xD;
      delivered in an anterosuperior direction, over the posterolateral aspect of the vertebra on&#xD;
      the right lamina-pedicle junction of C3.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sham manipulation to the right C3/C4 segment was administered using the same 'set-up' as&#xD;
      for the manual manipulation; however, once the barrier was engaged, the head was&#xD;
      re-positioned to neutral with no thrust applied. The control group individuals were&#xD;
      positioned supine for the same twenty minutes as the other groups and they received no manual&#xD;
      contact.&#xD;
