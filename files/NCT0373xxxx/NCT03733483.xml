  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a small intervention study with healthy males aged 20-65 years old who habitually&#xD;
      sleep 7-9 hours/night.This study investigates if and how sleep restriction, independent of&#xD;
      circadian misalignment (e.g. shift work, jet lag), induces a decrease in the bone formation&#xD;
      marker Procollagen I Intact N-Terminal Propeptide (PINP). The specific aim is to evaluate the&#xD;
      mechanistic underpinnings for the relationship between sleep restriction and suppression of&#xD;
      bone formation. The study will enroll 12 healthy male participants and have a two-week&#xD;
      intervention after enrollment.&#xD;

    <description>Participants in this arm will sleep for 8 hours at their habitual time for 1 week outpatient. Food will be provided for the outpatient week by the study. After the outpatient week participants will check into our inpatient Clinical Translational Research Center (CTRC) for a 9 day inpatient stay. During their inpatient stay participants will be sleep restricted to a 5 hour/night sleep opportunity for nights 2-7 of their inpatient stay. Outcome measures include a 24-hour serum draw (urine and blood) which will occur on night 1 (pre) and night 8 (post). Patients will be given a 10 + hour recovery sleep period on night 8 of their inpatient stay.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        o Adult men aged 20-65 years old who habitually sleep 7-9 hours/night.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Regularly go to sleep after midnight;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Shift work 1 year prior to study;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Travel &gt;1 time zone 4 weeks prior to study or need to travel during study;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  More than moderate activity level (&gt;3 days of exercise per week &gt;30 min of exercise&#xD;
             per session);&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Individuals who are concurrently participating in another research protocol that would&#xD;
             influence their safe participation in this study. For example, participants involved&#xD;
             in a study that requires blood draws or ingestion of experimental medication as this&#xD;
             would increase the risk of participation in our study and/or compromise study results.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any clinically significant unstable medical or surgical condition within the last year&#xD;
             (treated or untreated), including history of a clinically significant abnormality of&#xD;
             the neurological system (including cognitive disorders or significant head injury) or&#xD;
             any history of seizure (including febrile seizure-sleep loss has been used clinically&#xD;
             to induce seizures in patients with epilepsy). Given the wide range of illnesses that&#xD;
             are encountered in medical practice, it would not be possible to provide a&#xD;
             comprehensive list of each and every disease that could serve as grounds for exclusion&#xD;
             for the subject. However, the following is a list of illness categories that would&#xD;
             certainly be grounds for exclusion: Connective Tissue and Joint Disorders;&#xD;
             Neurologic/cognitive Disorders; Musculoskeletal Disorders; Immune Disorders;&#xD;
             Chronobiologic Disorders; Cardiovascular Disorders; Respiratory Disorders; Kidney&#xD;
             Disorders; Infectious Diseases; Hematopoietic Disorders; Neoplastic Diseases; and&#xD;
             Endocrine and Metabolic Diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Self-reported or newly diagnosed medical condition that is still being investigated or&#xD;
             is not under good control, including those identified on screening labs such as:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Out-of-range values measured on a fasting blood sample: glucose &gt; 100 mg/dl,&#xD;
                  thyroid stimulating hormone &lt;0.5 or &gt;5.0 uU/ml, abnormal alkaline phosphatase &lt;39&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Any clinically significant psychiatric condition, as defined by DSM-V. Individuals&#xD;
             with a history of most psychiatric illnesses or psychiatric disorders will be&#xD;
             excluded, such as but not limited to depression, anxiety, alcoholism, drug dependency,&#xD;
             schizophrenic disorders, and personality disorders (performed by medical history and&#xD;
             physician interview). However, a personal history of limited prior counseling,&#xD;
             psychotherapy (e.g., for adjustment reactions) will NOT be exclusionary. Evaluation of&#xD;
             Psychiatric/Psychological Suitability:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Subjects must demonstrate a full understanding of the requirements and demands of&#xD;

                  the CES-D are reviewed immediately and appropriate referrals are made if&#xD;
                  necessary.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Individuals who are unaware of specific psychiatric diagnoses who have a history&#xD;
                  of having been treated with antidepressants, neuroleptic medications or major&#xD;

             frequent sleep walking], insomnia, including but not limited to hypersomnias such as&#xD;
             apnea, periodic limb movements, narcolepsy). Sleep disorders will be screened by&#xD;

          -  Dwelling below Denver altitude (1,600 m) 6 months prior to testing;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Greater than moderate caffeine (&gt;500 mg/day) or alcohol use (&gt;14 standard drinks/week&#xD;

    <limitations_and_caveats>1) A protocol deviation resulted in slightly longer sleep duration on one night in one participant. Results were unchanged when data were re-analyzed without data from that participant. 2) This data was from a small cohort of young, healthy, physically active men. 3) Activity restrictions imposed during sleep restriction may not accurately reflect activity during real-life sleep restriction. 4) Study diets provided may not accurately replicate real-life changes in diet due to sleep restriction.</limitations_and_caveats>
