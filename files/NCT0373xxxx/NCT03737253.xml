  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim is to be able to predict the hormonal response according to gonadotropin receptor&#xD;
      genotype and hormone type used for treatment of women undergoing in vitro fertilization or&#xD;
      egg donation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome will be measured as pregnancy success, live born babies and unwanted side effects.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Women undergoing in vitro fertilization receive high doses of the gonadotropins follicle&#xD;
      stimulating hormone (FSH) and human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG), which is acting as&#xD;
      luteinizing hormone (LH) for stimulation of the ovaries in order to obtain a high number of&#xD;
      eggs. There are however marked individual differences in the hormonal response, ranging from&#xD;
      lack of increased egg maturation to hyper stimulation. The hypothesis is that genetic&#xD;
      variants in the gonadotropin receptors (LH and FSH receptors), are influencing the outcome.&#xD;
      This assumption is supported by a recent study on more than 600 women undergoing in vitro&#xD;
      fertilization, demonstrating that whereas only 10% of women with asparagine in both genes&#xD;
      (FSHR N680S and LHR N312S) became pregnant, 40% of those with serine did (Lindgren I et al.&#xD;
      Hum Repr 2016; 3:672-83).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Most (90%) of the women were treated with rFSH (recombinant). However, of the 10% asparagine&#xD;
      carriers who actually became pregnant, most if not all, were treated with menotropin - a&#xD;
      urine derivated compound (Menopur, Ferring), which contains both LH and FSH. This finding was&#xD;
      not stressed in the manuscript as it could have been due to chance because of the small&#xD;
      number of women treated with menotropin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective is therefore to perform a prospective randomized study regarding efficacy of&#xD;
      treatment in the first and second in vitro fertilization trial with rFSH and menotropin,&#xD;
      respectively, genotype taken into account.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In total 890 women, 445 in Poznan, Poland and 445 in Malmö, Sweden, with unexplained&#xD;
      infertility or a male or tubal factor indication for treatment will be invited to participate&#xD;
      in the study. At first appointment, information is provided and informed consent retrieved.&#xD;
      Two blood samples are drawn and stored at -20°C; one for subsequent genotyping and one for&#xD;
      anti mullerian hormone measurement. The succeeding treatment is according to normal&#xD;
      procedures at respective clinic.&#xD;
