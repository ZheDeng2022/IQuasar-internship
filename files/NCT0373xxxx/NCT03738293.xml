  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Women undergoing late preterm birth are at high risk of delivering a newborn with neonatal&#xD;
      hypoglycemia. The investigators plan to monitor interstitial glucose levels prior to delivery&#xD;
      in these women in order to develop a better understanding of the relationship between&#xD;
      maternal hyperglycemia and neonatal hypoglycemia.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnancy admitted to labor and delivery between 34w0d and 36w5d&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  English speaking women&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  High probability of delivery in late preterm period defined by any of the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Membrane rupture by 2 criteria (pooling, positive nitrazine, or ferning) OR&#xD;
                  leaking amniotic fluid from the cervix&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Preterm labor with intact membrane, defined as at least 6 uterine contractions in&#xD;
                  60 minutes and at least: cervical dilation greater than or equal to 3cm dilated&#xD;
                  OR 80% effaced OR planned delivery by induction of labor or cesarean in no less&#xD;
                  than 24 hrs and no more than 7 days, for any indication as deemed necessary by&#xD;
                  the provider&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Received at least one dose of corticosteroid within twelve hours of enrollment&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any prior antenatal corticosteroid course in current pregnancy&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Systemic corticosteroid administration during current pregnancy&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Fetal demise or known major fetal anomaly, including cardiac anomaly or hydrops&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Maternal contraindication to betamethasone: hypersensitivity reaction to any component&#xD;
             of the medication, idiopathic thrombocytopenic, purpura, systemic fungal infection, or&#xD;
             current use of amphotericin B&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Diabetes, pregestational or gestational&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Preexisting plan for intrapartum monitoring of maternal glucose levels for any reason&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Delivery expected within 12 hours of randomization, because of insufficient time for&#xD;
             corticosteroids to confer benefit, including:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Ruptured membranes with cervical dilation ≥ 3cm or with more than 6 contractions&#xD;
                  per hour unless Pitocin is deferred for at least 12 hours&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Chorioamnionitis&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. Cervical dilation ≥ 8cm&#xD;
&#xD;
               4. Evidence of non-reassuring fetal status requiring immediate delivery&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  To ensure that there is an adequate proportion of women presenting at 34 to 35 weeks&#xD;
             gestation, enrollment will be restricted so that no more than 50% of the women in the&#xD;
             trial present at 36 weeks.&#xD;
