  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of Dr. Rogers' research plan involves developing and pilot testing a&#xD;
      theory-driven, culture-specific intervention that specifically targets masculinity barriers&#xD;
      care and colorectal cancer (CRC) uptake among African-American men (ages 45-75). CRC is&#xD;
      preventable as screening leads to identification and removal pre-cancerous polyps; however,&#xD;
      African-American men consistently have the highest CRC mortality rates across all gender and&#xD;
      racial/ethnic groups; and their CRC screening uptake remains low for uncertain reason.&#xD;
      Contributing factors are etiologically complex, yet but culture-specific masculinity barriers&#xD;
      to care may contribute to low CRC screening uptake among African-American men. Examining&#xD;
      masculinity barriers to care is vital as CRC screening may challenge some cultural role&#xD;
      expectations and self-representations of African-American men whose tendency is to delay&#xD;
      help-seeking medical care. The study's specific aims are to: 1) develop, validate, and test a&#xD;
      culture specific measure of masculinity barriers to care relative to CRC screening uptake&#xD;
      among African-American men; and 2) develop and pilot test a theory-driven, culture-specific&#xD;
      intervention that targets masculinity barriers to care, psychosocial factors, and CRC&#xD;
      screening uptake among African-American men. Barbershops are historically known as culturally&#xD;
      appropriate and trusted venues in African-American communities, and are critical for this&#xD;
      research as they provide a pathway for reaching African-American men with masculinity&#xD;
      barriers to care who are not regularly receiving healthcare services, and in particular, CRC&#xD;
      screening. The proposed study and integrated training plan well-position Dr. Rogers to launch&#xD;
      an independent investigator career focused on informing culture-specific interventions to&#xD;
      eliminate cancer inequities among African-American men.&#xD;

      The investigator will conduct research in the Salt Lake City metro area (Salt Lake&#xD;
      City-Provo-Orem) of Utah. African American men's CRC screening rates in UT are substantially&#xD;
      lower than in other states, and the Salt Lake City region has the largest population of&#xD;
      African-Americans in the state.10,50 Approach. The investigator propose a multi-stage mixed&#xD;
      methods study (Figure 1), beginning with an exploratory sequential design validating the&#xD;
      items for subsequent use in a pilot mixed methods intervention to accomplish aims. For Aim 1&#xD;
      (Years 1-2), the investigator will collect and analyze QUALitative data from 2 sources -&#xD;
      focus groups and cognitive interviews - to validate and test a culture-specific scale of&#xD;
      masculinity barriers to care among African-American men (hereafter called the Masculinity&#xD;
      Barriers to Care Scale, MBCS). Next, the investigator will administer the MBCS as an online&#xD;
      QUANTtitative survey with the target population to evaluate the association between scale&#xD;
      scores and CRC screening uptake. For Aim 2 (Years 3-5), the investigator will consider&#xD;
      existing evidence-based approaches (e.g., motivation interviewing), the integrated results&#xD;
      (QUAL + QUANT) from Aim 1 regarding masculinity barriers to care, and community input to&#xD;
      design a novel, culturespecific, behavioral intervention - one aimed at increasing CRC&#xD;
      screening uptake (fecal immunochemical test; FIT) among African-American men and feasible for&#xD;
      delivery in barber shops. The investigator will pilot test the peer intervention in a two-arm&#xD;
      cluster randomized intervention (6 barbershops, randomized by site) to account for&#xD;
      differences in barbershop culture and reduce contamination. The primary outcomes for the&#xD;
      pilot are recruitment, sample size estimation, preliminary efficacy, and acceptability. The&#xD;
      investigator will also conduct post-intervention interviews with participants from both arms&#xD;
      to evaluate acceptability (i.e., why and how each arm was or was not successful).&#xD;

    <description>We anticipate the culture-specific arm developed minimally will include two core components: barbers as motivational interviewers, and (2) fecal immunochemical test (FIT) kits distributed by barbers. If we choose this route for the culture-specific arm, preliminary data from our barbers suggest I teach the barbers the MI technique using content that stems from Aim 1 findings. Additional components for this arm may be developed during the APEASE process.</description>
