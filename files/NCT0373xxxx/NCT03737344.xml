    <textblock>
      This trial will help inform the development of a new treatment for intracerebral haemorrhage&#xD;
      (ICH; also known as haemorrhagic stroke). ICH is a type of stroke caused by spontaneous&#xD;
      bleeding into the brain. In the hours to days after bleeding occurs, inflammation develops in&#xD;
      the brain around the haematoma (collection of blood in the brain). Inflammation is the body's&#xD;
      natural response to injury, however when it continues unchecked there is a risk that the&#xD;
      brain tissue around the haematoma will become swollen. This type of swelling can worsen&#xD;
      existing stroke symptoms or cause new deficits such as speech disturbance and limb weakness,&#xD;
      which can lead to long term disability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The level of inflammation in the blood is high after ICH. The investigators want to&#xD;
      investigate whether blocking this inflammation can improve overall recovery. The&#xD;
      investigators research group has extensively investigated the use of a well-established&#xD;
      anti-inflammatory drug, Kineret® in trials with patients who have suffered a stroke or brain&#xD;
      haemorrhage. Kineret® is similar to a naturally-produced protein called interleukin-1&#xD;
      receptor antagonist (IL-1Ra) and is already licensed to treat patients with rheumatoid&#xD;
      arthritis. The investigators have evidence from these previous studies that Kineret® reduced&#xD;
      levels of inflammation in the blood after ischaemic stroke (caused by a blockage in an&#xD;
      artery). However, in order to develop Kineret® as a treatment for ICH, the investigators need&#xD;
      to know if it reduces levels of inflammation present in the blood following ICH and if it&#xD;
      reduces swelling in the brain.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators know from previous studies that the level of inflammation in the blood is&#xD;
      high after haemorrhagic stroke and want to investigate whether blocking this inflammation can&#xD;
      improve outcomes. The only current treatments for haemorrhagic stroke are aimed at&#xD;
      significantly reducing the blood pressure and reversing the action of any anticoagulants&#xD;
      (e.g. warfarin) where necessary. Surgery to remove the blood clot is not an option for all&#xD;
      participants and the benefits of this are not clear.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators research group has extensively investigated the use of a well-established&#xD;
      anti-inflammatory drug, Kineret® in trials with participants who have suffered a stroke or&#xD;
      brain haemorrhage. Kineret® is similar to a naturally-produced protein called interleukin-1&#xD;
      receptor antagonist (IL-1Ra) and is already licensed to treat patients with rheumatoid&#xD;
      arthritis. The investigators have evidence from these previous studies that Kineret® reduced&#xD;
      levels of inflammation in the blood after ischaemic stroke (caused by a blockage in an&#xD;
      artery). In another trial, the investigators collected samples of the haematoma blot clot&#xD;
      removed during surgery in 47 participants who had suffered a haemorrhagic stroke. These&#xD;
      participants were taking part in a trial of 'keyhole' surgery as a treatment for haemorrhagic&#xD;
      stroke. The investigators found that higher levels of naturally occurring IL-1Ra in and&#xD;
      around the haematoma blood clot is linked to less brain swelling a few days later. This&#xD;
      suggests that Kineret® may reduce swelling in the brain after haemorrhagic stroke. However,&#xD;
      in order to develop Kineret® as a treatment for haemorrhagic stroke, the investigators need&#xD;
      to know if it reduces levels of inflammation present in the blood and if it reduces swelling&#xD;
      in the brain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators also want to investigate whether blocking inflammation can improve outcomes&#xD;
      following ICH. If the results of this trial show promise, it could support the decision to&#xD;
      run a much larger trial to establish whether lowering inflammation improves recovery after&#xD;
      haemorrhagic stroke.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients admitted to a neurosurgical centre within 8 hours of intracerebral haemorrhage (ICH)&#xD;
      on brain imaging will be considered for study participation. Potential participants will be&#xD;
      identified by the clinical team and will be referred to the research teams at the sites&#xD;
      following usual and established pathways. These pathways may include potential participants&#xD;
      being identified by; (i) Screening the acute referral databases/medical records, (ii)&#xD;
      Attendance at ward round and, (iii) Referral by Accident and Emergency team. All members of&#xD;
      the research teams at the sites have an existing working relationship with the clinical teams&#xD;
      and are employed by the research site (hospital Trust). This procedure is employed at sites&#xD;
      in order to identify potential participants for all acute and hyper acute research studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Capacity to consent may be an issue within this patient group. An appropriately trained&#xD;
      member of the research team will carry out a formal assessment of capacity, where&#xD;
      appropriate. Where it is not possible to obtain consent from the patient due to lack of&#xD;
      capacity, the investigators will seek consent from their personal legal representative. If&#xD;
      the patient lacks capacity to consent to participation and no personal legal representative&#xD;
      exists, the decision to include the patient will be made by a senior member of the clinical&#xD;
      team who is independent of the research team (professional legal representative).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the event that a patient has the capacity to consent to participation, but is unable to&#xD;
      complete and sign the relevant consent form due to physical difficulties resulting from their&#xD;
      clinical condition or pre-existing physical impairments (e.g. visual difficulties or limb&#xD;
      weaknesses), witnessed, verbal consent will be obtained. The patient will be asked to orally&#xD;
      confirm their willingness to participate in each stage of the trial to the professional legal&#xD;
      representative (most likely a member of the clinical team independent of the research group)&#xD;
      who will then be asked to confirm this consent in writing. In the event that the physical&#xD;
      difficulties resolve during the patient's inclusion in the trial, a further consent form will&#xD;
      be completed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Where initial consent is obtained from the patient's personal legal representative or the&#xD;
      professional legal representative, the capacity of the patient to consent will be reassessed&#xD;
      before each research assessment/intervention. If the patient regains capacity, they will be&#xD;
      given information about the trial and asked to confirm willingness to continue trial&#xD;
      participation by signing a consent form. Where initial consent is given by the patient, it&#xD;
      will be made clear that they will remain in the trial should capacity be lost unless the&#xD;
      decision to withdraw them is made by their representative, the research team, or by their&#xD;
      clinical team.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Consent to trial participation will include sharing of personal contact data with the trial&#xD;
      centre in order to conduct follow up assessment and the optional consent to storage of blood&#xD;
      samples for use in other ethically-approved research.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following consent, the research nurse will conduct an initial 'baseline' assessment. This&#xD;
      will be written in the medical notes and also in an individual research file (Case Report&#xD;
      Form). This first assessment will record details of how well the patient was at the time of&#xD;
      inclusion in the trial as well as how well they were in the 3 months before stroke. The&#xD;
      assessment will also record information such as age, sex and ethnicity and past medical&#xD;
      history (including recent infections, previous stroke, risk factors, medications and&#xD;
      vaccinations). A physical examination will record measurements of temperature, heart rate and&#xD;
      blood pressure. A similar assessment will be repeated on each of the following 4 days after&#xD;
      symptom-onset. The final assessment will be completed the morning after the final injection&#xD;
      has been given. After this assessment the research team will ask the patient to verbally&#xD;
      reconfirm consent that contact details can be passed to the coordinating centre (Chief&#xD;
      Investigator's Team at University of Manchester) In addition to the baseline assessment, a&#xD;
      research blood sample will be obtained to measure levels of inflammation at baseline. This&#xD;
      blood sample will be up to 10ml (2 teaspoons) and will be taken from existing venous lines&#xD;
      (where possible) to minimise discomfort for the participant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After obtaining the baseline blood samples and baseline assessments, the participant will be&#xD;
      randomised to treatment arm or placebo. The system will generate a unique participant&#xD;
      identification number which will be used on all documentation from this point to identify&#xD;
      subsequent samples, for communications and for data collection purposes. First dose of trial&#xD;
      medication must be delivered within 8 hours of ICH and as soon as possible after&#xD;
      randomisation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will receive 6 injections of identical doses of Trial Drug (Kineret® or placebo)&#xD;
      over 3 days after ICH. However, only half the participants will receive Kineret® and the&#xD;
      other half will receive placebo (dummy drug). The investigators will measure and compare&#xD;
      levels of inflammation in the blood of both groups of participants before and after treatment&#xD;
      with Trial Drug to assess if inflammation is lower in those who receive Kineret® compared to&#xD;
      those given placebo. The investigators will also assess all brain imaging performed on trial&#xD;
      participants in both treatment groups during their in-patient stay to see if there are&#xD;
      differences in the number showing signs of further bleeding and brain swelling. If the&#xD;
      results of this trial show promise, it could support the decision to run a much larger trial&#xD;
      to establish whether lowering inflammation improves recovery after ICH.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At approximately 3 days after randomisation, the patient will undergo a repeat CT brain scan&#xD;
      as part of the research trial. This scan is the same type as the one performed at admission.&#xD;
      Although this scan is being performed as part of the research trial, the results will also be&#xD;
      available to the doctors looking after the patient and may assist them in deciding on&#xD;
      specific treatments. This scan will take approximately 10 minutes to perform but the&#xD;
      participant may be away from the ward or department for up to 45 minutes. The scan will be&#xD;
      used by the researchers who will compare it to brain imaging performed on admission to&#xD;
      hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to the CT scan, participants may also be asked to undergo a Magnetic Resonance&#xD;
      (MR) brain scan between 2-4 days from the onset of the stroke symptoms. This is optional and&#xD;
      is dependent on availability of hospital scan appointments. Members of the research team at&#xD;
      the recruiting hospital will record everything that happens to the patient during their&#xD;
      in-patient stay. At 30 days after randomisation, participants will be followed up to further&#xD;
      check their well-being. If the patient is still in hospital on this date, this assessment may&#xD;
      be performed face-to-face by a member of the research team. However, if the participant has&#xD;
      been discharged home or returned to their local hospital, the researcher will perform this&#xD;
      assessment by telephone with the participant or their relative/friend if they are not able or&#xD;
      their local healthcare provider. It is expected that this assessment will take around 45&#xD;
      minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participant will be contacted again by telephone at approximately 90 days (3 months) by a&#xD;
      member of the research team at the trial coordinating centre in Manchester. This assessment&#xD;
      will assess the participant's recovery after ICH and will include questions about their mood,&#xD;
      level of fatigue and quality of life. It is expected that this assessment will take around 45&#xD;
      minutes. If for any reason, the participant is unable to complete this assessment, a member&#xD;
      of their family may answer the questions on their behalf.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This will complete the patient's participation in the trial. With the participant's&#xD;
      permission, the researchers at the recruiting hospital will contact the participant's family&#xD;
      doctor (GP), Consultant and any other Health Care Professional involved in their care to let&#xD;
      them know of the patient's participation in the trial.&#xD;
