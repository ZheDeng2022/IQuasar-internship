      This is a single site, open-label, randomized, single-dose, Phase 1 study in post-menopausal&#xD;
      women.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The objective of the study is to characterize the pharmacokinetics of progesterone in&#xD;
      post-menopausal women after the insertion of a vaginal ring containing 2.0 g of progesterone.&#xD;
      Progesterone is slowly released from the ring within 90 days (sustained-release). Study&#xD;
      participants will use the vaginal ring for a period of 91 days (13 weeks).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Progesterone blood concentrations will be determined during the use of the vaginal ring and&#xD;
      after removal of the vaginal ring after a period of use of 13 weeks. In subgroups of&#xD;
      participants, progesterone blood concentrations will also be determined after removal of the&#xD;
      ring for a period of 2 hours or 4 hours on Day 28 of use. A study participant has completed&#xD;
      the study when the final evaluation takes place, which is 7-15 days after removal of the&#xD;
      vaginal ring on Day 91.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The safety of the progesterone vaginal ring will be assessed based on the adverse events&#xD;
      reported.&#xD;
