      Importance: The chronic consequences of TBI are established, but ongoing support for adults&#xD;
      with TBI living in the community is limited. This puts undue burden on care partners,&#xD;
      particularly during the transition from hospital to home. It often leads to adverse&#xD;
      consequences among care partners, such as emotional distress and increased substance abuse.&#xD;
      Currently, there are no evidence-based interventions for care partners of adults with TBI to&#xD;
      prepare them for this role. Problem Solving Training (PST) is an evidence-based,&#xD;
      self-management approach with demonstrated efficacy for care partners of individuals with&#xD;
      disabilities, but it has not been delivered or evaluated during inpatient rehabilitation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aims: Aim 1): To assess the feasibility of providing PST to care partners of adults with TBI&#xD;
      during the inpatient rehabilitation stay; Aim 2) To assess the efficacy of PST + education vs&#xD;
      education alone for improving caregiver burden, depressive symptoms, and coping skills&#xD;
      Method: The investigators will conduct a randomized control trial of PST + Education vs&#xD;
      Education alone during the inpatient rehabilitation stay of individuals with TBI. The&#xD;
      investigators will enroll 172 care partners and conduct baseline assessment, with follow-up&#xD;
      assessment at 1 month and 6 months post-discharge. For Aim 1, the investigators will measure&#xD;
      number of sessions of PST completed and care partner satisfaction. For Aim 2, the&#xD;
      investigators will compare differences in PST+Educaion vs. Education alone in measures of&#xD;
      caregiver burden, depressive symptoms, and coping skills at 1-month and 6-months&#xD;
      post-discharge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Conclusion: The investigators anticipate that care partners will be able to complete a&#xD;
      minimum of 3 sessions during the inpatient rehabilitation stay and that PST + Education will&#xD;
      be more effective than Education alone for reducing caregiver burden and depressive symptoms&#xD;
      and improving positive coping among care partners. PST is an evidence-based, self-management&#xD;
      approach with a strong theoretical foundation that has demonstrated efficacy for care&#xD;
      partners of individuals with disabilities. Early work indicates that it is also effective for&#xD;
      care partners of adults with TBI. However, there are no studies evaluating whether delivery&#xD;
      of PST to care partners is feasible during inpatient rehabilitation. The proposed project&#xD;
      builds upon this foundation of evidence to address this critical gap in the literature. It&#xD;
      will provide evidence for effective ways to support and improve outcomes for care partners&#xD;
      during the transition from hospital to home.&#xD;

      North TX TBIMS Module Project: Problem Solving Training (PST) for Care Partners of Adults&#xD;
      with Traumatic Brain Injuries (TBI) during Inpatient Rehabilitation&#xD;
&#xD;
      Care partners of adults with TBI report substantial burden and emotional distress and a need&#xD;
      for more resources and skills training to manage the transition from hospital to home.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will assess the feasibility and efficacy of Problem Solving Training for&#xD;
      care partners during inpatient rehabilitation to reduce burden and depressive symptoms and&#xD;
      improve coping across the critical transition from inpatient rehabilitation to the community.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statement of Problem: The chronic consequences of TBI are recognized, but ongoing support for&#xD;
      adults with TBI living in the community is limited. This puts undue burden on care partners,&#xD;
      particularly during the transition from hospital to home. It often leads to adverse&#xD;
      consequences among care partners, such as emotional distress and increased substance&#xD;
      abuse.1,2 Care partners of individuals with TBI often experience high levels of burden, which&#xD;
      may result in depression, anxiety, increased somatic symptoms, and reduced quality of&#xD;
      life.1,3,4 Care partner burden is largely predicted by the extent to which care partners'&#xD;
      perceived needs are met.1,5,6 As the consequences of TBI continue to change over time, so too&#xD;
      do the perceived needs of care partners.7-11 One study suggests that only 55% of care partner&#xD;
      needs are perceived as being met.12 A systematic review of qualitative studies for care&#xD;
      partners of adults with stroke revealed seven themes with regard to experiences, needs, and&#xD;
      preferences of care partners during inpatient rehabilitation.13 Care partners expressed a&#xD;
      desire to be included, informed, and recognized as a stakeholder in recovery, the need to&#xD;
      navigate an alien culture and environment, and the need to manage the transition home.13 The&#xD;
      authors concluded that &quot;the investigators need to make deliberate efforts to provide a more&#xD;
      inclusive environment that better supports and prepares carers for their new role&quot;.13 Despite&#xD;
      this established need during inpatient rehabilitation, there are currently no evidence-based&#xD;
      interventions for care partners of adults with TBI to prepare them for their new role prior&#xD;
      to discharge of care recipients from inpatient rehabilitation. Hence, there is a critical&#xD;
      need to provide care partners of individuals with TBI with the necessary skills to navigate&#xD;
      this difficult transition from hospital to home.14 Self-management training for care partners&#xD;
      of adults with other chronic conditions demonstrates strong potential for application to care&#xD;
      partners of adults with TBI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Proposed Solution: Problem-Solving Training (PST) is an evidence-based, self-management&#xD;
      approach that teaches a simple, systematic method for evaluating problems, generating and&#xD;
      selecting solutions, creating and implementing realistic goals and action plans, and&#xD;
      evaluating whether those plans effectively addressed the specific goal.15,16 A growing body&#xD;
      of evidence indicates that PST post-discharge is associated with reduced distress among care&#xD;
      partners of adults with TBI.17-19 Problems previously seen as overwhelming are regarded as&#xD;
      solvable and manageable when approached in a stepwise fashion using PST, thereby reducing&#xD;
      perceived burden and emotional distress. PST empowers care partners to be active participants&#xD;
      in directing health and rehabilitation services.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 1: To assess the feasibility (compliance, satisfaction) of delivering Problem&#xD;
      Solving Training (PST) to care partners of individuals with TBI during inpatient&#xD;
      rehabilitation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 2: To assess the efficacy of PST plus TBI-specific education compared to&#xD;
      TBI-specific education alone for improving the outcomes of care partners of individuals with&#xD;
      TBI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Method: The investigators will conduct a randomized control trial of PST + Education vs&#xD;
      Education alone during the inpatient rehabilitation stay of individuals with TBI. The&#xD;
      investigators will enroll 172 care partners across sites and conduct baseline assessment,&#xD;
      with follow-up assessment at 1 month and 6 months post-discharge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size: The investigators plan to enroll 172 care partners to achieve an effect size&#xD;
      (group differences in burden at 1 month) of Cohen's d=.40; α=0.05, power=80%, and&#xD;
      attrition=10%. With recruitment projected to occur for 27 months, this would require&#xD;
      recruiting 6-7 participants per month across participating sites.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Description of Intervention: Care partners in the intervention group will receive PST&#xD;
      training plus TBI-specific education (6 sessions). Participants in the Control group will&#xD;
      receive TBI-specific education alone (6 points of contact).19 Sessions will last ~30-60&#xD;
      minutes each. All sessions will occur in-person whenever possible, or over the telephone when&#xD;
      meeting is not feasible. PST has been successfully delivered via both modalities, with&#xD;
      similar effects. Our group has particular experience delivering PST via telephone.19-22&#xD;
      Control group points of contact for education will last ~15 minutes each, with the first and&#xD;
      last session conducted in person and other contacts by phone. Trained members of the research&#xD;
      team with master's level education or equivalent experience will provide both interventions&#xD;
      using a specific curriculum that has been validated in our previous research studies20. These&#xD;
      activities will take place before discharge from inpatient rehabilitation. A structured&#xD;
      database will be used to record the session delivery to ensure fidelity, including&#xD;
      completion, reasons for non-compliance, method of delivery, session length, and a brief&#xD;
      summary of the PST steps covered during session.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessments: For Aim 1, the investigators will measure number of PST sessions completed, if a&#xD;
      minimum of 3 sessions were completed (Y/N), and care partner satisfaction. For Aim 2, the&#xD;
      investigators will compare differences in PST+Education vs. Education alone in measures of&#xD;
      caregiver burden, depressive symptoms, and coping skills, including alcohol use, at 1-month&#xD;
      and 6-months post-discharge. The investigators will explore sustainability of the PST&#xD;
      intervention at 6-months, testing group by time interactions for caregiver burden, depressive&#xD;
      symptoms, and coping. Outcomes measures will include the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification&#xD;
      Test (AUDIT),23 Brief Coping Orientation to Problems Experienced (Brief COPE),24 Patient&#xD;
      Health Questionnaire 9 (PHQ9),25 Zarit Burden Interview (ZBI),26 and the Client Satisfaction&#xD;
      Questionnaire (CSQ8).27 Analysis Plan: The primary outcome to assess feasibility is the&#xD;
      completion of a minimum of 3 sessions of PST. The investigators will also report the number&#xD;
      of sessions completed prior to discharge, and method of completion (in person or via&#xD;
      telephone), to inform future intervention design. The investigators will descriptively&#xD;
      present reasons for non-compliance, captured through our intervention database. The&#xD;
      investigators will divide the participants into two groups, based upon completion of &lt;3&#xD;
      sessions or &gt;3 sessions. The investigators will then compare the two groups and explore&#xD;
      demographic or other baseline differences (e.g. in outcomes of interest, in inpatient length&#xD;
      of stay, etc.) to identify factors associated with compliance. The investigators will compare&#xD;
      the level of client satisfaction (CSQ-8) with the intervention in both groups. For all group&#xD;
      comparisons, the investigators will use t-tests, Mann-Whitney U test, or Chi Squared tests,&#xD;
      as appropriate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will calculate measures of central tendency or numbers and percentages for&#xD;
      all demographic baseline variables and descriptively compare PST Intervention to Education&#xD;
      groups, to reduce the overall number of comparisons and the likelihood of a type I error. If&#xD;
      there are group differences, the investigators will conduct formal statistical testing&#xD;
      (t-tests, Mann Whitney U tests, or Chi Square tests, as appropriate) to determine potential&#xD;
      confounding variables resulting from initial group differences and adjust for these variables&#xD;
      accordingly. The investigators will use intent-to-treat analyses to measure the differences&#xD;
      in each outcome measure between PST Intervention vs. Education groups at 1-month follow-up&#xD;
      using t-tests or Mann Whitney U tests, as appropriate. If covariate adjustment is determined&#xD;
      to be necessary based on baseline differences between the two groups, the investigators will&#xD;
      conduct Analysis of Covariance (ANCOVA) for each outcome, adjusting for relevant factors. To&#xD;
      address our second hypothesis, the investigators will assess group by time interactions,&#xD;
      including baseline, 1-month, and 6-month time points, using repeated-measures ANOVA/ANCOVA.&#xD;
      For the coping skills outcome, the investigators will use baseline data from all participants&#xD;
      and conduct exploratory factor analysis to identify second-order factors in our sample as a&#xD;
      means of data reduction and analyze total scores within the second-order factors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Implementation of research design is feasible given the time and resources: The investigators&#xD;
      have previously conducted a RCT delivering PST to 77 care partners of adults with TBI via&#xD;
      telephone beginning one week post-discharge.19 Care partners completed up to 10 sessions,&#xD;
      with 8 sessions as a target. Of the 77 participants, 41 (53.2%) completed 7-10 sessions, 30&#xD;
      (39.0%) completed 1-6 sessions, and 6 (7.8%) did not complete any sessions after&#xD;
      randomization. Dr. Juengst has experience as a treating therapist, trainer, and supervisor&#xD;
      for self-management interventions, including assessing treatment fidelity and navigating&#xD;
      intervention delivery during inpatient rehabilitation. She will train participating centers&#xD;
      in the conduct of this project via webinar and using a written manual. Interventionists will&#xD;
      demonstrate competency in the intervention before use. Assessments are self-reported, can be&#xD;
      completed by a research assistant (blinded to intervention allocation), and take 20-30&#xD;
      minutes to complete. Our timeline is feasible based on our past experience recruiting&#xD;
      participants, delivering self-management interventions, and participating in TBIMS modules&#xD;
      Addition to State-of-the-Art: The investigators anticipate that care partners will be able to&#xD;
      complete a minimum of 3 sessions during the inpatient rehabilitation stay, with the goal of&#xD;
      completing 6 sessions. The investigators also anticipate that PST + Education will be more&#xD;
      effective than Education alone for reducing caregiver burden and depressive symptoms and&#xD;
      improving positive coping among care partners. This study will provide evidence for effective&#xD;
      strategies to support and improve outcomes for care partners during the transition from&#xD;
      hospital to home. This will benefit the TBIMS as a whole by providing an evidence-based and&#xD;
      feasible intervention for care partners, upon whom the TBIMS relies heavily for participant&#xD;
      enrollment and data collection, in addition to the ongoing support that care partners provide&#xD;
      to the primary beneficiaries of TBIMS services, individuals with TBI. PST is an&#xD;
      evidence-based, self-management approach with a strong theoretical foundation that has&#xD;
      demonstrated efficacy for care partners of individuals with disabilities. Early work&#xD;
      indicates that it is also effective for care partners of adults with TBI. However, there are&#xD;
      no studies evaluating whether delivery of PST to care partners is feasible and effective&#xD;
      during inpatient rehabilitation. The proposed project builds upon this foundation of evidence&#xD;
      to address this critical gap in the literature.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>Participants are randomized and allocated after baseline assessment to PST + Education or Education only via stratified, blocked randomization. Randomization is stratified by participating center and then based on whether a single care partner or multiple care partners are participating for the same patient by participating TBIMS Center. The investigators used a block size of four to ensure equal numbers across groups and to account for potentially small numbers of participants at any given TBIMS Center. Randomization is computer-generated and maintained by the TBI Model Systems National and Statistical Data Center. Allocation assignments for each center are distributed to the site PI and maintained in a password-protected electronic file. Outcome assessors are blinded to intervention allocation.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>The PST intervention consists of six sessions that will follow a structured format based on the PST manual. In these sessions, the interventionist will first provide the TBI-specific education, introduce the participant to the PST steps, then help the care partner generate and select a problem to address first. Interventionist will facilitate the care partner's use of the ABCDEF steps of PST to develop a specific action plan to solve the problem. As problems are attempted or solved, the care partner will learn how to perform the steps on his/her own, thus acquiring self-management problem solving skills that will be applicable to future problems. The final session will include a review and generalization of the PST steps and progress made.</description>
