      Intubation processes of patients under general anesthesia are important in terms of patient&#xD;
      morbidity and mortality. The cervical region has also anatomical and physiologic speciality&#xD;
      in which stability of the general condition of the patient during this intubation process.&#xD;
      The cervical region needs to be manipulated very carefully due to respiratory center,&#xD;
      cardiovascular balance and neurological integrity. During general anesthesia, the patient&#xD;
      will be under the effect of muscle relaxant and especially the cervical region becomes&#xD;
      vulnerable to trauma. The intubations made by affecting the cervical region as little as&#xD;
      possible change the morbidity and mortality. Intubation with fiberoptic bronchoscopy and&#xD;
      videolaryngoscopy has reduced the complications that other methods can cause. Awake&#xD;
      intubation with fiberoptic bronchoscopy and videolaryngoscopy is important for neurological&#xD;
      evaluation during the procedure. In this study, we aimed to compare awake intubation by&#xD;
      videolaringoscopy and fiberotic bronchoscopy in patients with intubation difficulties due to&#xD;
      restriction of neck movements in cervical surgery.&#xD;

      INTRODUCTION: Intubation processes of patients under general anesthesia are important in&#xD;
      terms of patient morbidity and mortality. The cervical region has also anatomical and&#xD;
      physiologic speciality in which stability of the general condition of the patient during this&#xD;
      intubation process. The cervical region needs to be manipulated very carefully due to&#xD;
      respiratory center, cardiovascular balance and neurological integrity. During general&#xD;
      anesthesia, the patient will be under the effect of muscle relaxant and especially the&#xD;
      cervical region becomes vulnerable to trauma. The intubations made by affecting the cervical&#xD;
      region as little as possible change the morbidity and mortality. Intubation with fiberoptic&#xD;
      bronchoscopy and videolaryngoscopy has reduced the complications that other methods can&#xD;
      cause. Awake intubation with fiberoptic bronchoscopy and videolaryngoscopy is important for&#xD;
      neurological evaluation during the procedure. In this study, we aimed to compare awake&#xD;
      intubation by videolaringoscopy and fiberotic bronchoscopy in patients with intubation&#xD;
      difficulties due to restriction of neck movements in cervical surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODS: Patients in the ASA I-II-III risk group, aged 18-80 years, who will undergo cervical&#xD;
      surgery operation between 01.04.2018 and 01.04.2020 by the Brain and Neurosurgeon at Trakya&#xD;
      University Medical Faculty Hospital will be included. Patients will be prospectively&#xD;
      randomized into 2 groups; Group F (intubation with fiberoptic in awake patients), Group V&#xD;
      (intubation with videolaringoscopy in awake patients). In successful intubations the time&#xD;
      between the time of access to the criterion laryngoscope and the appearance of the vocal cord&#xD;
      will be assumed to be 60 seconds. Complications during intubation (mucosal injury, tooth&#xD;
      trauma, lip injury, hypoxia (SpO2 &lt;95%) and esophageal intubation) will be recorded. After&#xD;
      intubation, the presence of blood in the Endotracheal Tube (ETT) or sore throat, which is&#xD;
      expressed by the patient after recovery, will also be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STATISTICAL METHODS: Student-T test or Mann Whitney U test will be applied among the groups.&#xD;
      Ki-Kara test will be used to compare categorical data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CONCLUSION: Evaluation of mortality and morbidity of the patients awake intubation with&#xD;
      fiberoptic bronchoscopy and videolaryngoscopy for cervical trauma surgery.&#xD;
