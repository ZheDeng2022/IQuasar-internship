    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well pembrolizumab works in treating participants with&#xD;
      ovarian cancer that has come back after previous treatment. Monoclonal antibodies, such as&#xD;
      pembrolizumab, may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate clinical anti-tumor activity of pembrolizumab monotherapy based on objective&#xD;
      response rate (ORR) as assessed by the investigator per immune related Response Evaluation&#xD;
      Criteria in Solid Tumors (irRECIST) in patients with recurrent ovarian cancer (ROC) whose&#xD;
      tumors show an immunoreactive gene expression signature.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate clinical anti-tumor activity of pembrolizumab monotherapy based on&#xD;
      progression-free survival (PFS) as assessed by the investigator per irRECIST in patients with&#xD;
      ROC whose tumors show an immunoreactive gene expression signature.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To evaluate clinical anti-tumor activity of pembrolizumab monotherapy based on PFS rate&#xD;
      at 6, 12 and 18 months as assessed by the investigator per irRECIST in patients with ROC&#xD;
      whose tumors show an immunoreactive gene expression signature.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To evaluate and characterize the tolerability and safety profile of the study population&#xD;
      after being treated with pembrolizumab as monotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To assess correlations of the immunoreactive gene signature with the validated a PD-L1&#xD;
      immunohistochemistry (IHC) assay using Merck's proprietary 22C3 antibody and the clinical&#xD;
      activity observed in the study population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants receive pembrolizumab intravenously (IV) on day 1. Courses repeat every 3 weeks&#xD;
      for up to 35 courses (2 years) in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable&#xD;
      toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, participants are followed up at 30 and then every 9 and&#xD;
      12 weeks thereafter.&#xD;
