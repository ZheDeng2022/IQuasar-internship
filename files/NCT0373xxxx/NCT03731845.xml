  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Over the past decade, advances in diagnosis and treatments have dramatically increased the&#xD;
      rates of cure for young patients with cancer. As a consequence, a new population of cancer&#xD;
      survivors has emerged whose fertility is compromised after cancer therapy. Indeed,&#xD;
      gonadotoxicity is a well-known long-term side effect of cancer treatment in young patients&#xD;
      having survived malignant diseases. More than 80% of women of childbearing age, treated for&#xD;
      breast cancer with standard protocol of neoadjuvant (4 cycles of 5-fluorouracile -&#xD;
      epirubicin- cyclophosphamide (FEC) and 4 cycles of docetaxel) or adjuvant chemotherapy (3 FEC&#xD;
      and 3 docetaxel), show an alteration of their ovarian reserve 2 years after completion of the&#xD;
      treatment, as a result of chemotherapy-related follicular loss. Therefore, according to the&#xD;
      extent of the follicular damages, the gonadal function may vary from moderate to severe&#xD;
      diminished ovarian reserve (DOR) and possibly to the ultimate stage of premature ovarian&#xD;
      insufficiency (POI).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators propose a multicentric and prospective study of a cohort of young women with&#xD;
      breast cancer to evaluate whether genetic polymorphisms, previously identified as being&#xD;
      correlated with age at menopause in the healthy population, are associated with the intensity&#xD;
      of the follicular decline following chemotherapy in young breast cancer survivors.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      With 48 763 new cases in 2012, breast cancer represents the first female cancer in France.&#xD;
      Although the incidence of this malignancy peaks after the age of 60 years, nearly 2500 of&#xD;
      reproductive-age women are diagnosed with breast cancer every year. Recent advances in cancer&#xD;
      therapy markedly improved the rates of cure for young adult suffering from cancers. Over the&#xD;
      past decade, the mortality rates in breast cancer patients has decreased by more than 1.6%&#xD;
      per year. The five year survival rate for women under 45 with breast cancer is now&#xD;
      approaching 80%. As a consequence, a new population of young cancer survivors has emerged&#xD;
      whose fertility is compromised after cancer therapy. Thus, the question of fertility&#xD;
      preservation (FP) in young cancer patients has become a major issue in the care-personalized&#xD;
      path. Indeed, information regarding the risks of infertility and FP counselling may&#xD;
      contribute to improving the quality of life and the coping of patients with the burden of&#xD;
      cancer treatment. Therefore, oncofertility counselling by a specialist is now recommended for&#xD;
      all young cancer patients having to undergo treatment that may reduce the fertility&#xD;
      potential.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Gonadotoxicity is a well-known long-term side effect of cancer treatment in young patient&#xD;
      having survived malignant diseases. Neoadjuvant or adjuvant chemotherapy usually combining&#xD;
      alkylating agent and taxane, is often recommended for young women presenting with breast&#xD;
      cancer. However, alkylating agents, such as cyclophosphamide have been shown to cause&#xD;
      extensive dose-dependent loss of primordial follicles in cancer patients. Beside a&#xD;
      enhancement of apoptosis, cyclophosphamide might induce a follicular loss through an&#xD;
      activation of the primordial follicle recruitment: the &quot;burnout&quot; phenomenon.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Moreover, the extent of ovarian damages depends not only on the nature and dose of&#xD;
      chemotherapy but also on age and ovarian reserve before treatment. Women age at chemotherapy&#xD;
      administration is one of the most predictive risk factor of follicular depletion after the&#xD;
      end of treatment. Therefore, according to the extent of the follicular damages, the gonadal&#xD;
      function may vary from moderate to severe diminished ovarian reserve (DOR) and possibly to&#xD;
      the ultimate stage of premature ovarian insufficiency (POI).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently, patients' age and the values of markers of the follicular ovarian status (serum&#xD;
      anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH) levels and ultrasonographic antral follicle count (AFC),&#xD;
      measured before the initiation of gonadotoxic treatment, are considered the most accurate&#xD;
      predictive factors of post chemotherapy ovarian function. However, they may have some&#xD;
      limitations since important inter-individual variations in the ovarian reserve two years&#xD;
      after completion of treatment are reported in patients displaying similar age, AMH as well as&#xD;
      AFC. This observation suggests that, besides environmental and pathologic variables, genetic&#xD;
      variations, inducing different ovarian sensitivity to chemotherapy, might be at play.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Indeed, in healthy women, age at natural menopause varies from 40 to 55 years and is&#xD;
      characterized by a strong familial concordance. Many studies of large genome-wide association&#xD;
      (GWAS) found a link between the age and variants of some genes involved in DNA repair, DNA&#xD;
      maintenance and folliculogenesis as initial follicular recruitment. Since these genes may&#xD;
      have an influence on the ovarian reserve (together with the effects of gonadotoxic treatment&#xD;
      regimens), investigators hypothesize that genetic polymorphisms known to be associated with&#xD;
      age at menopause (BRSK1 (rs1 172822), ARHGEF7 (rs7333181), MCM8 (rs236114), PCSK1 (rs271924),&#xD;
      IGF2R (rs9457827), TNF (rs909253), AMH (rs10407022) and AMHR2 (rs2002555) could be linked to&#xD;
      the intensity of the follicular depletion after chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective is to evaluate whether genetic polymorphisms, previously identified as&#xD;
      being correlated with age at menopause onset in the healthy population, are associated with&#xD;
      the intensity of the follicular decline following chemotherapy in young breast cancer&#xD;
      survivors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objectives are to evaluate the association between genetic polymorphisms and&#xD;
      other parameters related to female fertility, as menstrual cycle profile, pregnancy rate,&#xD;
      serum anti-mullerian hormone (AMH) levels and ultrasonographic antral count (AFC) after&#xD;
      chemotherapy such as the menstrual cycle profile and pregnancy rates.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible subjects followed in the different participating centers will be included in this&#xD;
      study. Informed consent will be obtained from all participating individuals before blood&#xD;
      sample collection and molecular studies. AMH measurement and AFC will be performed before the&#xD;
      cancer treatment randomly during the menstrual cycle phase. In the same time, blood samples&#xD;
      will be taken for the genotyping. All patients will receive adjuvant or neoadjuvant&#xD;
      chemotherapy containing cyclophosphamide, epirubicin, 5-FU and docetaxel. Patients will be&#xD;
      evaluated 12 and 24 months after the end of the treatment. A clinical (menstrual cyclicity)&#xD;
      and hormonal (AMH, FSH) evaluation associated with ultrasound evaluation of AFC of enrolled&#xD;
      patients will be performed. Thus, association between genetic polymorphism and the depth of&#xD;
      ovarian decline (classified as: normal ovarian reserve, moderate DOR, severe DOR or POI)&#xD;
      after healing will be evaluated.&#xD;
