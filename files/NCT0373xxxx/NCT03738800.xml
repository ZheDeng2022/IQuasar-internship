    <textblock>
      This is a phase 2 randomized, multi-center, double-blind, vehicle controlled, 90 day, safety,&#xD;
      efficacy, and systemic exposure study followed by a 90 day open-label extension of&#xD;
      trifarotene cream in adults and adolescents with autosomal recessive ichthyosis with lamellar&#xD;
      scale.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a 2-cohort, multicenter study in subjects with moderate to severe LI. Adults (Cohort&#xD;
      A) and adults and adolescents (Cohort B) will be randomized in a double-blind fashion to 1 of&#xD;
      2 doses of active or vehicle and treated twice weekly for 90 days. Subjects who complete the&#xD;
      randomized, double-blind portion of the study will be eligible to enter a 90 day, open-label&#xD;
      extension study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Approximately 15 adults (≥18 years old) will be randomized into the first cohort of subjects&#xD;
      (Cohort A) in a 1:1:1 ratio and treated twice weekly for up to 90 days. If no safety issues&#xD;
      are identified, both adults and adolescents (ages 12-17 years, inclusive) will be allowed to&#xD;
      enroll in Cohort B. Subjects in Cohort B will be randomized 1:1:1 and treated twice weekly&#xD;
      for up to 90 days in the same manner as subjects in Cohort A.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All subjects who complete 90 days of double-blind study treatment will be eligible to enroll&#xD;
      in a 90 open-label extension. Subjects in the open-label extension will receive active twice&#xD;
      weekly for up to 90 days.&#xD;

    <measure>Quality of life measurement per Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI)</measure>
    <time_frame>90 Days</time_frame>
    <description>The DLQI, or the Dermatology Quality of Life Index, is a dermatology-specific Quality of Life instrument. It is a simple 10-question validated questionnaire with 6 domains (symptoms and feelings, daily activities, leisure, work and school, personal relationships, and treatment); higher scores indicate poorer quality of life. Responses collected are on a scale of 0-3 depending on the question relevance to the subject.&#xD;
Response (Score) Very much (scored 3) A lot (scored 2) A little (scored 1) Not at all (scored 0) Not relevant (scored 0) A minimum score of 0 and maximum score of 30 is obtained by summing the score of each question. The higher the score, the more quality of life is impaired.&#xD;
0-1 = no effect at all on patient's life 2-5 = small effect on patient's life 6-10 = moderate effect on patient's life 11-20 = very large effect on patient's life 21-30 = extremely large effect on patient's life</description>

    <description>The Ectropion Severity Score (ESS), is a proven system to be reliable and sensitive to the presence of ectropion and has a maximum score of 8 points (0-8). A higher score indicates a worse ectropion. The score takes the severity of ectropion in terms of lateral and medial apposition, scleral show, conjunctival show, and roundness of the eye into account and gives an indication of the functional aspects involved in ectropion by scoring redness, excess tear film, and the position of the lacrimal punctum A point scale of 0=Nonaffected, 0.5=Emerging, 1= Affected is assigned to 8 observations.&#xD;

    <measure>Quality of life measurement per EQ-5D-5L</measure>
    <time_frame>180 Days</time_frame>
    <description>The EQ-5D is a standardized instrument developed by the EuroQol Group as a measure of health-related quality of life used in a wide range of health conditions and treatments. The EQ-5D consists of a descriptive system and the EQ visual analog scale (VAS). Descriptive system of health-related quality of life states consisting of 5 dimensions (mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, anxiety/depression) each of which can take 1 of 5 responses.&#xD;
no problem&#xD;
slight problems&#xD;
moderate problems&#xD;
severe problems&#xD;
extreme problems It should be noted that the numerals 1-5 have no arithmetic properties and should not be used as a cardinal score. The EQ VAS records the respondent's self-rated health on a 20 cm vertical, visual analogue scale with endpoints labelled 100-'the best health you can imagine' and 0-'the worst health you can imagine'. This information can be used as a quantitative measure of health as judged by the individual respondents.</description>
