  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hepatic encephalopathy (HE) corresponds to the neurological or the neuropsychological&#xD;
      symptoms caused by an acute or chronic liver disease and/or porto-systemic shunt. Many&#xD;
      patients present neurological symptoms even if their liver disease is stabilized.&#xD;
      Furthermore, HE is associated with an altered quality of life and an increased mortality. Its&#xD;
      incidence is high with 30 to 80% of cirrhotic patients that will display according to&#xD;
      retained diagnostic criteria. HE symptoms are going from subtle neuropsychological&#xD;
      abnormalities detected only on neuropsychological testing, minimal HE, to altered&#xD;
      consciousness, overt HE. Recently, the therapeutic armamentarium has increased with now&#xD;
      several drugs (rifaximin, ammonia lowering agents) that are able to prevent new bouts of HE.&#xD;
      Unfortunately, the diagnosis of minimal HE is difficult and no gold-standard is available.&#xD;
      None of the proposed test is rapid and easily performed at bedside.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently, different studies suggest the potential interest of the study of the ocular&#xD;
      movements in HE. Abnormalities in ocular saccades could be an early predictor of cortical&#xD;
      impairment. In a pilot feasibility study using an eye-tracker, we could show that cirrhotic&#xD;
      patients with minimal HE had, compared to healthy controls, increased latencies, decreased&#xD;
      speed of voluntary and reflex saccades, more errors in anti-saccades, more anticipations&#xD;
      saccades and more difficulties to fix the target.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our hypothesis was that the use of the eye-tracker will enable the diagnosis of minimal HE by&#xD;
      studying the characteristics of saccades and anti-saccades.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since no gold-standard is available for the diagnosis of minimal HE, we will use the&#xD;
      conclusion of an adjudication committee formed by 2 experts. Their clinical judgment will&#xD;
      take into account the results of medical history, clinical examination, neuropsychological&#xD;
      testing, PHES, Critical Flicker Frequency test (CFF), ammonemia levels, EEG and brain MRI&#xD;
      with spectroscopy.&#xD;

      Hepatic encephalopathy (HE) corresponds to the neurological or the neuropsychological&#xD;

      Recently, different studies suggest the potential interest of the study of the ocular&#xD;
      movements in HE. Abnormalities in ocular saccads could be an early predictor of cortical&#xD;
      impairment. In a pilot feasibility study using an eye-tracker, we could show that cirrhotic&#xD;

&#xD;
      Our hypothesis was that the use of the eye-tracker will enable the diagnosis of minimal HE by&#xD;
      studying the characteristics of saccads and anti-saccads.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since no gold-standard is available for the diagnosis of minimal HE, we will use the&#xD;
      conclusion of an adjudication committee formed by 2 experts. Their clinical judgment will&#xD;
      take into account the results of medical history, clinical examination, neuropsychological&#xD;
      testing, PHES, Critical Flicker Frequency test (CFF), ammonemia levels, EEG and brain MRI&#xD;
      with spectroscopy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Gold standard definition: diagnostic of minimal HE as stated by adjudication committee&#xD;
      composed of 2 experts. Each patient will be classified as : patient without EH (neither&#xD;
      clinical or minimal) and patient with EHM. The results of medical history, clinical&#xD;
      examination, EEG results (triphasic waves, decreased frequency), ammonia level (above&#xD;
      50mcmol/L or not), neuropsychological testing encompassing PHES (below -4 or not) and CFF&#xD;
      (below 39Hz or not), brain MRI with MR-spectroscopy (HE profile on MRS) will be aggregated to&#xD;
      obtain their adjudication. All the tests will be performed by trained personal aware of the&#xD;
      evaluation of cirrhotic patients with possible HE. The eye-tracking evaluation will be&#xD;
      blinded to the conclusion of the adjudication committee (presence or absence of HE).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since the data from the eye-tracker are quantitative, a ROC curve will be used to evaluate&#xD;
      the diagnostic performance of each parameters measured by the study device (mainly, saccads&#xD;
      latencies, voluntary and reflexes ones, and the percentage of errors in saccads, anti-saccads&#xD;
      and voluntary anticipations).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The ability of each measure to diagnose minimal HE will be evaluated by the area under the&#xD;
      ROC and its 95% confidence interval. Sensibility, specificity, positive and negative&#xD;
      predictive values will be given for each possible cut-off with their 95% confidence interval.&#xD;
      In order to optimize the diagnostic performance, the most discriminating values will be used&#xD;
      to build a multivariate diagnostic model. To prevent overfitting frequently associated with&#xD;
      &quot;standard&quot; logistic regression, the selection of variables of interest will be performed with&#xD;
      the LASSO method. This method is valuable when the number of subjects are limited.&#xD;
