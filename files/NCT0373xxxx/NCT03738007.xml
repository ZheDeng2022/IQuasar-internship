  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study was purposed to evaluate the non-inferiority of YVOIRE volume, a hyaluronic acid&#xD;
      product, in terms of correction of wrinkles and safety in nasolabial fold deep-dermal&#xD;
      injection, compared to Perlane, the control preparation.&#xD;

    <description>Wrinkle Severity Rating Scale (WSRS)&#xD;
Absent: no visible fold; continuous line&#xD;
Mild: Shallow but visible fold with slight indentation; minor facial feature&#xD;
Moderate: moderately deep fold; clear facial feature visible at normal appearance but not when stretched. Excellent correction expected.&#xD;
Severe: very long and deep; prominent facial feature; less than 2mm visible fold when stretched&#xD;
Extreme: extremely deep and long folds; 2-4mm visible v-shaped fold when stretched; detrimental to appearance; unlikely to have satisfactory correction with injectable implant alone</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Age: Women in 30~55 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Those whose wrinkle scores in the treatment site (nasolabial fold) at the screening&#xD;
             visit were Stage 3 or 4 in the 5-stage Wrinkle Severity Rating Scale (WSRS)&#xD;
             symmetrically&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Those who were informed on this study in detail, understood it completely, decided to&#xD;
             participate in the study own their own and signed on the informed consent form.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Those with a skin disease in the face (skin infection, eczema, psoriasis, rosacea,&#xD;
             herpes etc.)&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Those with a history of severe allergy&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Those with hypertrophic scar or a history of kelloid&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
          7. Those who had underwent a chemical peeling, laser procedure (including IPL) or&#xD;
             insertion of other bioadaptive materials (however, those who had been treated with HA&#xD;
             filler could participate in the study if the date of treatment was known and the&#xD;
             investigator judged that the filler effect had disappeared).&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Patients with a malignant tumor&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Women in pregnancy or lactation&#xD;
&#xD;
