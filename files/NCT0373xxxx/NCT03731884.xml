  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) is mostly caused by the rupture or the erosion of&#xD;
      a vulnerable atherosclerotic plaque, initiating with intraluminal thrombosis and resulting in&#xD;
      total occlusion of the coronary artery. Thrombus formation is a complex and dynamic process&#xD;
      involving flow, blood cells and several plasma proteins, and it has not been clearly&#xD;
      elucidated. To define - through proteomic approach - the composition of occluding thrombus&#xD;
      and its time changes in patients with STEMI, trying to identify novel biomarkers of coronary&#xD;
      thrombosis.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Ischemic heart disease is the leading contributor to the worldwide burden of disease, as&#xD;
      assessed on the basis of disability-adjusted life-years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ST-Elevation Myocardial Infarction (STEMI) is associated with a coronary occlusive thrombosis&#xD;
      in 90% of patients, non-ST Elevation Myocardial Infarction (NSTEMI) only in 26% of cases. In&#xD;
      this regard, increasing attention is given to the composition of coronary thrombus. In acute&#xD;
      STEMI, platelet and fibrin content in the occlusive thrombus is highly dependent on ischemia&#xD;
      time, thus one can infer that this may have a substantial impact on the efficacy of drugs or&#xD;
      devices used for coronary reperfusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Among several circulating cell types - platelets, erythrocytes, monocytes, and neutrophils -&#xD;
      as well as plasma molecules, modulating the thrombosis process, platelets constitute the&#xD;
      major cellular component of the thrombus and their activation is essential for thrombus&#xD;
      formation. Although the role of platelets in thrombosis has been deeply characterized, the&#xD;
      molecular mechanisms underlying platelet activation and focal adhesion within human coronary&#xD;
      thrombi, the composition, time changes of the occluding thrombus and its interaction with the&#xD;
      other cells have not been clearly elucidated, mainly due to the difficult accessibility to&#xD;
      the thrombotic material. Thrombus aspiration, although having a controversial role as an&#xD;
      adjunctive strategy in primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) for STEMI and NSTEMI,&#xD;
      relies on the extraction of occlusive thrombi by an aspiration catheter, advanced in the&#xD;
      coronary arterial tree and constitutes a unique opportunity for obtaining coronary thrombi&#xD;
      from patients suffering from AMI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Defining variable molecular pathways responsible for thrombus formation according to time&#xD;
      lapse and pathophysiology may pave the way to newer therapeutic strategies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis of the study Coronary thrombus undergoes significant modification according to the&#xD;
      pathophysiology of formation (erosion, plaque rupture or metal strut exposure) and time-lapse&#xD;
      from symptom onset.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The exact definition the molecular composition of coronary thrombus and of its proteomic and&#xD;
      metabolomics patterns may identify the target of newer therapeutic strategies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aims of the study are: to elucidate the molecular composition of coronary thrombus in AMI, to&#xD;
      understand, at molecular level, phenotypic alteration related to thrombus formation, to&#xD;
      highlight new potential factors involved in disease's onset or related to time of thrombus&#xD;
      formation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A consecutive series of patients admitted for an ACS, with either STEMI and occluded&#xD;
      infarct-related artery or NSTEMI and visible thrombus in the culprit artery will be deemed&#xD;
      suitable for thrombus aspiration. PCI will be performed with a standard procedure, with&#xD;
      either femoral or radial access. All patients will be receiving acetylsalicylic acid (100 mg&#xD;
      daily) and a P2Y12 inhibitor - clopidogrel (600 mg, then 75 mg daily), prasugrel (60 mg, then&#xD;
      10 mg daily) or ticagrelor (180 mg daily). After insertion of the arterial sheath, every&#xD;
      patient will receive 70 IU/kg of heparin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After guidewire positioning across the lesion, the thrombus aspiration system will be&#xD;
      advanced with gentle suction and several passages will be performed through the culprit&#xD;
      lesion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The lyophilized thrombus from each patient enrolled will undergo to extensive molecular&#xD;
      characterization in term of proteins, metabolites (Amino Acids and Acylcarnitines) and polar&#xD;
      lipids.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Polar metabolites and lipids from thrombus will be extracted and analyzed following a&#xD;
      validated methodology: 5 mg of wet thrombus will be added to a 330 μL of methanol solution&#xD;
      containing deuterated internal standards of amino acids and carnitines and lyso-sphingomyelin&#xD;
      100 µg/ml as internal standard for lipidomics. These solutions will be incubated at 45 °C for&#xD;
      50 min and finally divided into two aliquots. The first one will be used to analyze amino&#xD;
      acids and acyl-carnitines following our LC-MS/MS method already used in the analysis of CSF&#xD;
      as previously reported. The second aliquot will be employed to screen phospholipids by&#xD;
      LC-MS/MS. Data obtained will be quantified using MarkerLynx and NeoLynx software, and&#xD;
      statistically investigated using GraphPad Prism, Simca P+ and MetaboAnalyst software.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The lyophilized thrombus will be digested by Filter Aided Sample Prep (FASP) protocol. Then,&#xD;
      instrumental triplicates will be acquired for each sample by a platform nanoLC-ESI-QTOF-MS/MS&#xD;
      performing label free shotgun proteomics experiments in order to identify, and&#xD;
      simultaneously, quantify expressed proteins as already reported. The result of this study&#xD;
      will be a list of expressed proteins during coronary thrombus in acute myocardial infarction,&#xD;
      that may be used for bioinformatics analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will be processed by a dedicated software (Profile Analysis, Bruker, Markerlynx).&#xD;
      Highlighted metabolites/proteins will be identified by database and by fragmentation&#xD;
      analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specifically for metabolomics and lipidomics, the data will be processed to obtain peak&#xD;
      deconvolution and alignment, denoise and Total Ion Count normalization to give a table of&#xD;
      mass pairs with associated relative intensities for all the detected peak for each sample&#xD;
      analyzed. Then, the data matrix will be used for multivariate Analysis (PCA; PLS-DA) using&#xD;
      SIMCA-P + 11.0 (Umetrics AB, Umeå, Sweden).&#xD;
&#xD;
      By multi-omics researches and data processing, it will be available a panel of interesting&#xD;
      molecules as a framework for each clinical group studied. These biological compounds will be&#xD;
      then subjected to an in-silico analysis to rebuild their functional implications in the&#xD;
      physiology and molecular homeostasis of coronary thrombus in acute myocardial infarction. To&#xD;
      perform such a meta-analysis of the data we will mainly use Ingenuity Pathways Analysis&#xD;
      (IPA), (Ingenuity Systems, Mountain View, CA). Through the Pathways analysis and the Gene&#xD;
      Ontology it will be possible to identify the metabolic pathways and the secondary&#xD;
      genes/proteins inhibited and/or stimulated for a specific phenotype and consequently classify&#xD;
      potential effectors molecules and/or pharmacological target.&#xD;
