  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a prospective, open-label study to examine the performance of the LightPath®&#xD;
      Imaging System using the PET tracer 68Ga-RM2 in patients scheduled for and/or undergoing wide&#xD;
      local excision (WLE) with or without sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) or complete axillary&#xD;
      lymph node dissection(cALND) for breast cancer with an ER-positive invasive primary cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study consists of 3 sequential groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 1 (N=20 patients): Torso, i.e. base of skull to thighs, PET/CT imaging and axillary&#xD;
      gamma probe measurements (using a collimator) of 68Ga-RM2 to: determine the optimal scan&#xD;
      time-window post-injection; to extrapolate the optimal dose for resolution against axillary&#xD;
      background signal on gamma probe measurements (first 6 patients); and the value of 68Ga-RM2&#xD;
      PET/CT imaging for breast cancer staging (all 20 patients).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 2 (N=10 patients): Intraoperative LightPath® imaging with 68Ga-RM2 to familiarise site&#xD;
      with procedure and interpretation of intraoperative scans,validate the dose and timings&#xD;
      determined from Group 1, and optimise LightPath® Imaging parameters such as acquisition&#xD;
      resolution and duration. Group 2 scans will acquire LightPath® images of both intact and&#xD;
      incised cancer specimens for post-operative standardised, controlled assessment. Group 2 will&#xD;
      use the optimal scan time-window and 68Ga-RM2 activity extrapolated from at least the first 6&#xD;
      patients in Group 1. The dose of 68Ga-RM2 will be determined to optimise the intra-operative&#xD;
      imaging and axillary gamma probe measurements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 3 (N=50 patients): Intraoperative LightPath® imaging with 68Ga-RM2 to measure agreement&#xD;
      between LightPath® images and post-operative histopathology. Group 3 scans will acquire&#xD;
      LightPath® images of intact and incised cancer specimens for post-operative standardised,&#xD;
      controlled assessment. Group 3 will use the optimal scan time-window and 68Ga-RM2 activity&#xD;
      extrapolated from the first 6 patients in Group 1 with the optimised imaging parameters, and&#xD;
      dose developed from Group 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intraoperative LightPath® Images will be used to inform the surgeons about detectable&#xD;
      residual cancer in an attempt to achieve better guided cancer surgery and complete tumour&#xD;
      excision with clear WLE resection margins&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study site will use the local criteria considered standard of care to guide decisions to&#xD;
      act on positive margins. Lightpoint Medical will provide guidance to act on LightPath® Images&#xD;
      in the Instructions forUse (IFU). It will be at the Investigator's discretion to choose&#xD;
      whether to act based upon the intraoperative LightPath® Images.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Group 3,the resection margin status of the WLE specimen, cavity shavings (if any) and the&#xD;
      metastatic status of axillary (sentinel) lymph nodes as measured with the LightPath® Imaging&#xD;
      System will be compared with histopathology results. A positive margin on histology will be&#xD;
      defined as&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Invasive carcinoma: positive: ink on tumour; close: &lt;1mm; negative ≥1mm&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS)or pleomorphic lobular carcinoma in situ (LCIS) (if&#xD;
           present): positive: ink on tumour; close: &lt;2mm; negative ≥2mm.&#xD;
