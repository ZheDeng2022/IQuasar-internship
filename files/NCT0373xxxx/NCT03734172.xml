      This study will serve as a platform to evaluate new diagnostics in children suspected to have&#xD;
      TB, to establish diagnostic performance (sensitivity and specificity) and calculation of&#xD;
      positive and negative predictive values in a real-life cohort.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Finally, this study will comprise results of several tests in its database. This will allow&#xD;
      simulation of diagnostic algorithms, that may be composed of screening (i.e. rule-out) tests&#xD;
      together with confirmatory tests to maximize sensitivity and specificity.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Tuberculosis (TB) is a major cause of child morbidity and mortality in the world. There are&#xD;
      an estimated one million new paediatric cases and at least 239.000 deaths per year. As&#xD;
      childhood mortality on TB treatment is low at 1%, this highlights the fact that a large&#xD;
      proportion of cases are never diagnosed and thereby never receive appropriate treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The inability to correctly and timely diagnose paediatric TB is the main obstacle to control&#xD;
      disease and prevent adverse outcomes, specifically among infants and young children, children&#xD;
      with malnutrition, HIV-infection, and drug-resistant TB. Paediatric samples, which are&#xD;
      difficult to obtain, have small volumes and low bacterial burden, leading to low sensitivity&#xD;
      of currently applied diagnostic tests for TB, which are geared towards adults.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The World Health Organization has clearly stated that new and improved diagnostics for&#xD;
      children are a top priority.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With RaPaed TB, we designed a project that is ideally suited to evaluate a range of novel&#xD;
      diagnostics and sampling strategies in a population of symptomatic children with presumptive&#xD;
      TB with a high likelihood of mycobacteriological confirmation of disease. The key aspects of&#xD;
      the project are a multi-site collaboration of five geographically distinct sites in highly TB&#xD;
      endemic settings allowing a large sample size, high proportion of bacteriologically confirmed&#xD;
      cases, and making study findings generalizable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Internationally recognized experts in child TB clinical research are included in the study;&#xD;
      FIND's panel of diagnostic tests and expertise in diagnostics development and evaluation as&#xD;
      well in the WHO submission and review process of the gathered data; LMU with its track record&#xD;
      of delivering high-quality studies in the TB field; two large industry partners dedicated to&#xD;
      the development of robust point-of-care assays; and finally, early involvement of National TB&#xD;
      Programmes in the studies which will not only add to local capacity development, but also&#xD;
      enable rapid local approval and uptake.&#xD;
&#xD;
      974 paediatric patients were enrolled into the RaPaed study in the four African and one&#xD;
      Indian sites, with an average confirmation rate of 24% (study target: 25%).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ten new diagnostic techniques suitable for children are being assessed in this study. These&#xD;
      include a new stool protocol and Nasopharyngeal Aspirate for Xpert® MTB/RIF Ultra, TAM-TB&#xD;
      from the University of Munich/Beckman Coulter Inc., a host biomarker panel by the University&#xD;
      of Stellenbosch, host RNA tests, host protein biomarker tests (i.e. FIND and SomaLogic's&#xD;
      host-response serum markers), and two novel urinary LAM tests (i.e. UriTB direct,&#xD;
      FUJIFILM-urinary-LAM), and Cepheid's Fingerprick test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is realistic to think that this study will lead to WHO endorsement or recommendation of at&#xD;
      least two or more new assays or sampling strategies; with FIND leading the WHO submission&#xD;
      process which could therefore impact childhood TB policies globally.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this third period of the RaPaed-TB study, all relevant study documents have been&#xD;
      maintained such as the protocol, the Manual of Procedures, SOPs and Worksheets for collecting&#xD;
      the data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethics approval for the study conduct and all updates have been obtained centrally and in all&#xD;
      study sites by the time of submission of this report.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The database has been maintained and updated, fulfilling its function for study data&#xD;
      collection and analysis, as well as enabling study oversight and quality control.&#xD;
