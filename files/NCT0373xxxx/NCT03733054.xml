    <textblock>
      The proportion of US Veterans who are women is currently at its highest point in history and&#xD;
      is projected to continue increasing. Nonetheless, the literature regarding prosthetic and&#xD;
      functional outcomes in women Veterans with lower extremity amputation (LEA) is nearly&#xD;
      non-existent. Research in other healthcare systems indicates the presence of concerning&#xD;
      gender differences in both prosthetic outcomes and functional mobility, with women being less&#xD;
      likely to be prescribed a prosthesis, less likely to use it, and more likely to be&#xD;
      dissatisfied than men. This mixed-methods study will use VA administrative data, qualitative&#xD;
      interviews, and a patient survey to characterize women Veterans' outcomes as well as compare&#xD;
      them to those of male Veterans, resulting in the largest study to date on women Veterans with&#xD;
      LEA. Data from this rigorous evaluation will inform clinical care by identifying intervention&#xD;
      targets to improve prosthetic and functional outcomes for this understudied population.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Background: The VA has a long history of developing and providing state-of-the-art prosthetic&#xD;
      technology and rehabilitation services for Veterans with lower extremity amputations (LEA).&#xD;
      Despite VA's goal to provide patient-centered, gender-sensitive care to all Veterans,&#xD;
      prosthetics research in VA has mainly included and focused on the needs of men. Women are the&#xD;
      fastest growing demographic in VA, and VA currently provides care to over 1,200 women with a&#xD;
      major LEA. That number will likely increase as the number of women Veterans, currently at its&#xD;
      highest point in history, is expected to continue rising. Primary goals of rehabilitation&#xD;
      following a major LEA include successfully fitting a prosthesis and providing training to use&#xD;
      the prosthesis to achieve functional mobility. Greater prosthesis use is associated with&#xD;
      improved mobility, functioning, and independence as well as better quality of life. Thus,&#xD;
      identifying the extent to which women achieve functional mobility through prostheses that fit&#xD;
      them and meet their needs is critical to ensure that VA is providing excellent and equitable&#xD;
      care. Accordingly, the goal of this research is to provide information that will improve&#xD;
      clinical care for women Veterans with LEA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives: The objectives of this study are to: 1) characterize prosthetic prescription&#xD;
      rates, prosthetic-device types, time to prescription, and their correlates among women with&#xD;
      major LEA as well as evaluate gender differences in these outcomes using administrative data;&#xD;
      2) identify barriers and facilitators to achieving successful functional mobility, factors&#xD;
      impacting prosthetic use and satisfaction, and needs and preferences related to prostheses&#xD;
      among women with major LEA who were prescribed a prosthesis using qualitative interviews; and&#xD;
      3) characterize prosthetic use, prosthetic satisfaction, functional mobility, and&#xD;
      health-related quality of life and their correlates among women as well as evaluate gender&#xD;
      differences in these outcomes using survey data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: To achieve these objectives, the investigators will capitalize on VA's extensive&#xD;
      electronic medical record data, including the Corporate Data Warehouse (Aim 1), qualitative&#xD;
      interviews (Aim 2) and a quantitative survey (Aim 3) with Veterans with LEA. Both&#xD;
      administrative data and the survey will include women and men, to characterize women overall&#xD;
      and in comparison to men. The investigators will determine which patients have received&#xD;
      prescriptions for definitive prostheses by linking procedure data related to amputations and&#xD;
      prosthetics data (which are all available within the Corporate Data Warehouse); other&#xD;
      outcomes will be assessed via survey. For Aim 2, the investigators will conduct&#xD;
      semi-structured telephone interviews with a sample of women with a major LEA who were&#xD;
      prescribed a prosthesis. Aim 3 will involve a self-administered mailed survey that will&#xD;
      permit us to characterize prosthetic use, prosthetic satisfaction, functional mobility, and&#xD;
      health-related quality of life and evaluate clinical, social/environmental, and&#xD;
      prosthetist/prostheses-related factors as potential determinants of outcomes among women as&#xD;
      well as potential mediators that explain observed gender differences.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Impact: For VA to realize its vision of being a world leader in providing lifelong,&#xD;
      gender-sensitive amputation care, assessing prosthetic and functional outcomes among women is&#xD;
      critical, as is understanding the factors that may negatively and positively contribute to&#xD;
      women's prosthetic and functional outcomes. This study would significantly expand the&#xD;
      evidence base for women Veterans with LEA and produce information that would inform&#xD;
      improvements in clinical care for this population.&#xD;
