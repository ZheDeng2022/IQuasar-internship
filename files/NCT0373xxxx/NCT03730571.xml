  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study investigates the efficacy and safety of the AbsorbaSeal 6Fr Vascular Closure&#xD;
      device (VCD) for the closure of access site of patients requiring percutaneous diagnostic or&#xD;
      interventional procedures. An expected total of 50 patients will be enrolled in this study. A&#xD;
      total of 12 patients (4 patients per site) will be treated as roll-in phase, prior to&#xD;
      enrollment of the first patient. The primary objective of this study is to assess the safety&#xD;
      and effectiveness of the AbsorbaSeal 6Fr VCD. Enrollment into this study will include&#xD;
      anatomically eligible patients requiring diagnostic and interventional procedures. Following&#xD;
      physician training, patients will be enrolled. Efficacy and safety analyses will be based on&#xD;
      these patients.Patients will be followed procedurally to discharge, at one month, (follow-up&#xD;
      commitment). Secondary objectives are to further characterize adverse events (serious and&#xD;
      non-serious), clinical utility measures and health-related quality of life.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      With the increased number of percutaneous interventions being performed in outpatient&#xD;
      settings there is a growing need to obtain faster, safer, and more secure hemostasis&#xD;
      following these outpatient procedures. CyndRx believes an improved VCD will lead to more&#xD;
      widespread use and ultimately improve patient outcomes. The AbsorbaSeal Vascular Closure&#xD;
      Device (ABS-6) has been developed to meet this need. The ease of use and automatic deployment&#xD;
      of the device will eliminate the learning curve associated with the use of VCDs. The active&#xD;
      closure system used in the ABS-6 ensures a secure closure with every deployment. The&#xD;
      composition of the seal used is completely bio-absorbable and does not require the use of&#xD;
      adjunct materials (i.e. collagen, sutures, staples, etc.) needed in many of the devices&#xD;
      currently available.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The First In Man (FIM) trial demonstrated the safety and efficacy of the ABS-6 system in&#xD;
      humans (N=20). To further evaluate the safety and efficacy, up to 50 patients will be&#xD;
      enrolled in the CP002CE-study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of this study is to assess the safety and effectiveness of the&#xD;
      AbsorbaSeal 6Fr VCD. Enrollment into this study will include anatomically eligible patients&#xD;
      requiring diagnostic and interventional procedures. Patients will be followed procedurally to&#xD;
      discharge, at one month, (follow-up commitment). Secondary objectives are to further&#xD;
      characterize adverse events (serious and non-serious), clinical utility measures, and&#xD;
      health-related quality of life.&#xD;
