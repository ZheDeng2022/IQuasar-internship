  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of a drug called benralizumab in&#xD;
      individuals with severe, poorly controlled asthma with eosinophilic airway inflammation.&#xD;
      Eosinophils are a type of white blood cell that help fight off infections. Some people with&#xD;
      asthma have too many eosinophils in their airways and blood, which can cause airway&#xD;
      inflammation. Benralizumab is a new drug that is Health Canada approved and has been shown to&#xD;
      rapidly eliminate eosinophils. It has been used in patients with severe asthma to improve&#xD;
      lung function and reduce flair-ups, also known as exacerbations. Magnetic Resonance Imaging&#xD;
      (MRI) is an imaging tool that can look at the structure of the lungs when a subject inhales a&#xD;
      xenon gas mixture. In healthy individuals, the gas fills the lungs evenly, but in individuals&#xD;
      with lung disease, some of the areas of the lungs are not filled by the gas and the image&#xD;
      looks patchy. These patchy areas are called ventilation defects and they contribute to&#xD;
      reduced lung function. The goal of the study is to see if treatment with benralizumab will&#xD;
      improve these ventilation defects, overall lung function and blood and sputum eosinophil&#xD;
      levels. Subjects will receive treatment with benralizumab a total of 3 times, 4 weeks apart.&#xD;
      Before and after treatment, subjects will undergo a series of MRI tests, breathing tests,&#xD;
      blood and sputum analysis and a series of questionnaires to evaluate daily quality of life.&#xD;
      The hypothesis is that ventilation defects will significantly improve after benralizumab&#xD;
      treatment, and that this improvement will be different based on how long the patient has had&#xD;
      asthma.&#xD;

      This is an open-label, single arm, pilot study in patients with severe, poorly-controlled&#xD;
      eosinophilic asthma to quantify hyperpolarized 129-Xenon MRI ventilation defect percent (VDP)&#xD;
      before and after benralizumab therapy administered every 4 weeks for the first three&#xD;
      injections (subcutaneous injection). Male and female patients between 18 and 70 years of age&#xD;
      will be screened (Enrolment, Visit 1) and those that satisfy all inclusion and exclusion&#xD;
      criteria will undergo five additional two-hour study visits (Visit 2=Day 0/baseline, Visit&#xD;
      3=Day 14±2 days and Visit 4=Day 28±2 days, Visit 5=Day 56±2 days, Visit 6=112±2 days) which&#xD;
      will involve spirometry, plethysmography for airways resistance (Raw) and lung volumes,&#xD;
      forced oscillation technique (FOT), multiple breath nitrogen washout (MBNW) for the lung&#xD;
      clearance index (LCI) and 129-Xenon MRI pre- and post-bronchodilator, with the exception of&#xD;
      Visit 5, which will not include MRIs. At all visits fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO)&#xD;
      will be measured pre-bronchodilator. The Asthma Control Questionnaire (ACQ-6), the Asthma&#xD;
      Quality of Life Questionnaire (AQLQ) and the St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SQRQ)&#xD;
      will be completed at all visits except Visit 3. Sputum induction will be performed on Visits&#xD;
      2 and 4 to measure sputum eosinophils, and blood samples will be performed on Visits 1 and 4&#xD;
      to measure blood eosinophils. Participants that satisfy all inclusion and exclusion criteria&#xD;
      will complete a total of six study visits. Upon study enrolment, all participants will be&#xD;
      allocated to a benralizumab treatment arm (30 mg injection after completion of study&#xD;
      assessments on Visit 2/Day 0, Visit 4/Day 28 and Visit 5/Day 56). After Visit 6/Day 112, all&#xD;
      participants will be offered participation in the AstraZeneca Patient Support Program to&#xD;
      receive benralizumab therapy on Day 112 and every 8 weeks thereafter.&#xD;
