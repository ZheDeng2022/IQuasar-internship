      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      CTLA4 stands for cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen-4. It is a protein the body makes naturally&#xD;
      to check its immune system from attacking itself. Some people don t produce enough CTLA4&#xD;
      protein, causing problems due to overactive immune system such as big spleens, repeated lung&#xD;
      infections, breathing problems, stomach and intestine symptoms as well as inflamed brain and&#xD;
      nerve problems. Many have problems with their bone marrow causing low numbers of blood cells&#xD;
      like platelets, red blood cells or white blood cells, which is called cytopenia. Researchers&#xD;
      want to see if the drug abatacept can treat cytopenias by replacing the missing protein&#xD;
      CTLA4.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To see if abatacept is safe and helps treat cytopenias caused by CTLA4 deficiency.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      People ages 8-65 years who have CTLA4 deficiency with cytopenia&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be screened with medical history, medication review, physical exam and&#xD;
      blood and urine tests. They will continue their current medications and may start taking&#xD;
      antibiotics daily. Participants will receive either abatacept or placebo through a vein for 6&#xD;
      months. The study team will not know if you are receiving the study drug or the placebo&#xD;
&#xD;
      Women who can become pregnant must agree to use birth control measures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Men who get someone pregnant during the study will be asked to collect information and have&#xD;
      the partner contact the study team.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will undergo the following procedures before starting the study and at the&#xD;
      completion:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  radiology scans of body and brain&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  heart and lung function tests&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Bone marrow examination by a needle inserted into the hip bone to remove a small amount&#xD;
           of tissue to study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants may have a small camera on a long, thin tool passed down the throat into&#xD;
           the stomach and small intestine for evaluation of their gut.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Questionnaires about their disease, symptoms and quality of life&#xD;
&#xD;
      Over 6 months, participants will have regular study visits and get 8 doses of the study drug&#xD;
      or a placebo by intravenous injection. They will repeat some of the same tests done earlier&#xD;
      at the end of the study at assess response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      About 1 month after the last study drug visit, participants will have a final study visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Some participants may join a treatment extension for the study drug abatacept with no&#xD;
      placebo. They will sign a separate consent form for this.&#xD;

&#xD;
      Rare heterozygous mutations in cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen-4 (CTLA4) lead to a monogenetic&#xD;
      defect that presents with a heterogeneous clinical phenotype of recurrent infections,&#xD;
      lymphoproliferation, autoimmunity, and lymphocytic infiltration of target organs. Management&#xD;
      is challenging and focuses on treating infections, autoimmune complications, and end organ&#xD;
      damage due to lymphocytic infiltrates. Experience with the natural history of the disease and&#xD;
      therapies for underlying complications are limited. There is no established standard of care&#xD;
      for these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Abatacept is a biologically engineered CTLA4-mimetic that is approved as an intravenous (IV)&#xD;
      infusion to treat adult rheumatoid arthritis, adult psoriatic arthritis, and juvenile&#xD;
      idiopathic arthritis. Given that abatacept mimics CTLA4 function, we hypothesize that the&#xD;
      drug will prevent T-cell hyper activation, restore regulatory T-cell function, and thereby&#xD;
      treat the autoimmune and immune dysregulatory manifestations of CTLA4 deficiency.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is a phase 1/2, double-blind, randomized, intra-patient dose-escalation, placebo&#xD;
      controlled trial designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of abatacept in participants&#xD;
      with CTLA4 deficiency and cytopenia. Participants will come to the NIH Clinical Center&#xD;
      monthly for 210 days to receive infusions of study agent or placebo and to undergo safety and&#xD;
      research evaluations, including blood draw for cytopenia evaluation and scoring of disease&#xD;
      severity. Before and after the treatment period, participants will also have imaging,&#xD;
      pulmonary function testing, bone marrow biopsy, and endoscopy (symptomatic participants&#xD;
      only). Primary endpoints will be evaluated at Day 210. After completing the blinded treatment&#xD;
      trial, participants will be offered the option to enroll in a 6-month open-label extension&#xD;
      study for long term safety evaluation of abatacept.&#xD;
