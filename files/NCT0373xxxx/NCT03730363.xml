      Primary Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To evaluate dose limiting toxicity and to determine the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of&#xD;
      pentamidine in combination with salvage chemotherapy with ifosfamide, carboplatin and&#xD;
      etoposide (ICE) on a 3-weeks schedule in relapsed/refractory classical Hodgkin lymphoma&#xD;
      (cHL).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To estimate the overall best treatment response at 5- and 16-weeks from study&#xD;
           enrollment. Although the clinical benefit of these drugs in combination has not been&#xD;
           established, offering this treatment may provide a therapeutic benefit. The patients&#xD;
           will be carefully monitored for tumor response and symptom relief, in addition to safety&#xD;
           and tolerability.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To estimate the duration of response to the proposed combined therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To measure the protein of regenerating liver-3 (PRL-3) level of expression in patients&#xD;
           at time of relapse.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To measure circulating biomarkers of response (soluble CD30 (sCD30), and thymus and&#xD;
           activation-related chemokine (TARC)) in serum samples collected throughout treatment and&#xD;
           inhibition of (pSTAT, pAKT) in peripheral blood mononucleated cells (PBMC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exploratory Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To measure cell-free messenger RNA (cfmRNA) in peripheral blood.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To measure cell-free DNA in peripheral blood&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this Phase I study is to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD)&#xD;
      of Pentamidine. A two-stage continual reassessment method (CRM) will be employed to determine&#xD;
      dose escalation levels and the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of Pentamidine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specifically, a modified two-stage CRM will be employed with 2 patients per cohort at each&#xD;
      dose level. The trial starts with an escalation design from the lowest dose (2 mg/kg) with a&#xD;
      traditional 2+2 dose escalation method. After occurrence of the first DLT, dose assignment&#xD;
      will be determined by the CRM (2 patients/per cohort) using empirical model with restrictions&#xD;
      to avoid dose-skipping and escalation immediately after a toxicity outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A maximum of 12 patients will be enrolled into the trial during the escalation phase. Once&#xD;
      the MTD is reached, an additional 4 patients will be treated at this dose. Thus, 6 or more&#xD;
      patients will be treated at the MTD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The target DLT rate is 33% and the investigators choose to use 0.10, 0.20 and 0.33 as prior&#xD;
      toxicity distribution. CRM simulations indicate optimal performance of this design with high&#xD;
      dose recommendation probabilities (at least 48%) and more patients allocated to the correct&#xD;
      dose&#xD;
