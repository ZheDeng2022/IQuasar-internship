  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research study is evaluating a psychological intervention for caregivers of loved ones&#xD;
      with malignant gliomas.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Caregivers of loved ones with malignant gliomas frequently experience a physical and&#xD;
      psychological burden caring for their loved ones. The purpose of this study is to find out&#xD;
      whether a psychological intervention can help caregivers learn effective coping methods&#xD;
      during their loved one's treatment and make the experience of being a caregiver more&#xD;
      manageable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The psychological intervention will take place in a series of six sessions. A trained social&#xD;
      worker or psychologist will meet with the participant or talk with the participant over the&#xD;
      telephone or by video conference for 45 minutes at a time to discuss the caregiver experience&#xD;
      while developing effective skills to support the loved one as well as the participant over&#xD;
      the course of the loved one's illness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Upon the completion of the sessions, the investigators will have a short (30-minute) exit&#xD;
      interview to obtain the participant's feedback on the intervention. The investigators will&#xD;
      use the feedback to improve the intervention before further testing its effectiveness in&#xD;
      future research studies. The investigators will also ask the participant to complete&#xD;
      questionnaires before and after their participation in the intervention to help the&#xD;
      investigators understand the participant's coping skills, caregiving burden, mood, and&#xD;
      understanding about the loved one's illness.&#xD;
