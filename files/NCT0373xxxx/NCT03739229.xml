      This is a single center phase I, double-blind placebo-controlled study to assess&#xD;
      reactogenicity, safety and immunogenicity of a live monovalent A/17/Hong Kong/2017/75108&#xD;
      (H7N9) influenza vaccine in healthy male and female adults, 18 through 49 years of age.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase I, double-blind, individually-randomized (3:1, vaccine:placebo), controlled&#xD;
      trial with two groups, LAIV H7N9 and matched placebo. Healthy male and female adults 18&#xD;
      through 49 years of age will be invited to participate. For feasibility reasons and in order&#xD;
      for an independent Safety Monitoring Committee (SMC) to review safety data in a portion of&#xD;
      subjects initially, the total cohort of 40 subjects will be enrolled in two cohorts: one&#xD;
      cohort of 20 subjects, randomized at 3:1 (15 vaccine and 5 placebo), followed two weeks later&#xD;
      by a second identically composed cohort of 20 subjects randomized at 3:1 (15 vaccine and 5&#xD;
      placebo). After all volunteers of the first cohort have been observed for the first isolation&#xD;
      period (Day 0 to Day 6) after receipt of dose one, an interim safety review will be performed&#xD;
      by a SMC. The SMC will review all AEs and shedding data, for all subjects and will advise if&#xD;
      the volunteers of the first cohort may receive dose two of study vaccine or placebo and if&#xD;
      the additional 20 volunteers of the second cohort may be enrolled into the study. For each&#xD;
      cohort, the procedures and timelines are here summarized.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the day of first screening (S1), about 7 days (between 4 and 14 days) prior to&#xD;
      administration of dose one of study vaccine or placebo, subjects will be screened for&#xD;
      eligibility through medical history review, physical examination, testing for serologic&#xD;
      evidence of chronic viral infection [human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B virus&#xD;
      (HBV) or hepatitis C virus (HCV)], routine biochemical and hematological blood tests and&#xD;
      routine urinalysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For screening for serologic evidence of chronic viral infections, appropriate pre- and&#xD;
      post-test counseling must be provided.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subject screening for eligibility will continue and be completed on the second screening day&#xD;
      (S2). This second screening day will occur the same day as scheduled admission to the&#xD;
      isolation unit and administration of study vaccine or placebo (Day 0). Women will undergo&#xD;
      pregnancy tests using urine samples. All subjects will undergo an ear, nose and throat (ENT)&#xD;
      examination and examination by neurologist. Fully eligible subjects will be admitted to the&#xD;
      isolation unit. At that time, nasal swabs, nasal wick, saliva and blood specimens will be&#xD;
      collected for virologic and immunological testing prior to administration of study vaccine or&#xD;
      placebo. Blood and urine specimens will be again collected for routine biochemical and&#xD;
      hematological blood tests and urinanalysis; these results will serve to define baseline&#xD;
      status for subject prior to receipt of study vaccine or placebo but will not be used for&#xD;
      screening purposes. Subjects and investigators conducting assessments of safety will be&#xD;
      unaware of which allocation, LAIV H7N9 or matched placebo, is received; study vaccine and&#xD;
      placebo will be masked. Subjects will be carefully monitored for adverse reactions while in&#xD;
      the isolation unit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All subjects will remain in the isolation unit for at least 6 days after receipt of study&#xD;
      vaccine or placebo. Nasal swabs will be collected daily while subjects are in isolation to&#xD;
      test for presence of influenza virus shed in the nasal passage. Any subject exhibiting&#xD;
      conjunctivitis will also have a conjunctival swab collected on the day of appearance of the&#xD;
      sign. Any subject exhibiting influenza A virus shedding, as determined by real-time RT-PCR&#xD;
      positivity on a nasal swabs specimen, in the 2 days prior to each planned discharge day after&#xD;
      each dose (Days 5 or 6 or Days 33 or 34) will be kept in the isolation until PCR-diagnosis&#xD;
      results confirm that no influenza virus is present in a tested clinical specimens for at&#xD;
      least two consecutive days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Any subject still exhibiting evidence of influenza virus shedding in a nasal swabs on Days 5&#xD;
      or 6 or Days 33 or 34 post-administration with each dose will be placed on approved influenza&#xD;
      antiviral (oseltamivir) treatment at the standard dose for treatment of 75 milligrams (mg)&#xD;
      twice a day for a course of 5 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After discharge from the isolation unit, subjects will complete diary cards for AEs and use&#xD;
      of concomitant medications. Subjects will return to the isolation unit at four weeks (Day 28)&#xD;
      after administration of dose one of study vaccine or placebo. At that time, similar&#xD;
      procedures will be used for admittance to the isolation unit, for receipt of dose two of&#xD;
      study vaccine or placebo and for isolation and follow-up, with the additional procedure of&#xD;
      review of interim histories (and diary cards) since first discharge after dose one.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After second discharge from the isolation unit, subjects will again complete diary cards for&#xD;
      AEs and use of concomitant medications. Subjects will then return to the study center at four&#xD;
      weeks (Day 56) after administration of dose two of study vaccine or placebo for their study&#xD;
      visit. Interim histories (and diary cards) will again be reviewed and blood and nasal wick&#xD;
      specimens will be collected. Women will also undergo a final pregnancy screen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For assessment of safety, subjects will be observed for two hours after each administration&#xD;
      of study vaccine or placebo. Twice daily (early morning and late afternoon) examination will&#xD;
      be also used to assess reactions for 6 days after each administration of study vaccine or&#xD;
      placebo. ENT examination and examination by neurologist will also occur once per day on Days&#xD;
      6, 28, 34 and 56. Subjects will complete diary cards for unsolicited AEs from the day of each&#xD;
      discharge until return to the isolation unit for dose two (at Day 28) or until return to the&#xD;
      study center for the final study visit at four weeks post dose two (at Day 56). To assess&#xD;
      safety, blood and urine specimens will also be collected on days 3, 6, 28 (prior to&#xD;
      administration of dose two of study vaccine or placebo), days 31, 34 and 56 for testing by&#xD;
      routine biochemical and hematological blood tests and urinanalysis respectively. On the 0th,&#xD;
      3rd and 31st days of the study, instrumental examinations will be carried out (ECG,&#xD;
      echocardiogram, and spirometry with the assessment of respiratory function). In order to&#xD;
      assess late adverse events, volunteers will remain under observation for 6 months after the&#xD;
      second vaccination (28th day of the study) with monthly monitoring of their health condition&#xD;
      by telephone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the evaluation of mucosal IgA antibody, nasal wick and saliva specimens will be collected&#xD;
      on Day 0 (prior to administration of dose one of study vaccine or placebo), on Day 28 (prior&#xD;
      to administration of dose two of study vaccine or placebo) and on Day 56. For the evaluation&#xD;
      of serum antibodies (by HAI, microneutralization and IgA and IgG ELISA), serum specimens will&#xD;
      be collected on Day 0 (prior to administration of dose one of study vaccine or placebo), on&#xD;
      Day 28 (prior to administration of dose two of study vaccine or placebo) and on Day 56. To&#xD;
      study virus infectivity (by isolation in embryonated chicken eggs) and viral genetic&#xD;
      stability (by molecular sequencing of any isolated virus), nasal swab specimens will be taken&#xD;
      on Days 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 29, 30 and 31. To assess priming and stimulation of cytotoxic T&#xD;
      lymphocytes and other cytokine indicators, whole blood for isolation of PBMCs will be&#xD;
      collected on Days 0 (prior to administration of dose one of study vaccine or placebo), on Day&#xD;
      6 (prior to discharge from isolation unit), on Day 28 (prior to administration of dose two of&#xD;
      study vaccine or placebo), and on Day 56.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary study hypothesis is that two doses of cold-adapted, live monovalent (H7N9)&#xD;
      influenza vaccine will be safe in healthy adults.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Observed proportions of subjects exhibiting reactions, adverse events and clinical chemistry&#xD;
      anomalies, as well as proportions of subjects seroconverting or seropositive for influenza&#xD;
      antibodies using various methods, will be estimated with 95% confidence intervals. Geometric&#xD;
      mean titers (GMTs) will be estimated with 95% confidence intervals. The study will be&#xD;
      primarily evaluated based on the exact two-sided 95% confidence interval of the percentage of&#xD;
      vaccine recipients experiencing vaccine-related serious adverse events within 28 days of any&#xD;
      dose.&#xD;
