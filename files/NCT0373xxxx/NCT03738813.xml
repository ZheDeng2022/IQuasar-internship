  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Stroke is one of the leading causes of death and disability and has been described as a&#xD;
      worldwide epidemic (1). Stroke survivors are affected by impairments and limitations of&#xD;
      cognitive, language, perceptual, sensory, and motor functions. After a stroke, patients can&#xD;
      improve spontaneously within the first 3 months (2) and then more slowly in the following&#xD;
      year. The first day, decreased oedema and partial reperfusion of the ischemic penumbra may&#xD;
      possibly explain these phenomena, but the improvement of neurological deficit in the&#xD;
      following weeks suggests plasticity phenomena and brain cortical reorganization (3). While&#xD;
      most recovery is thought to be made in the first few weeks after stroke, patients may make&#xD;
      improvements on functional tasks many months after having a stroke (4). Restoring arm and&#xD;
      hand skill after a stroke remains challenging, even though stroke rehabilitation programs&#xD;
      have proven partial efficacy Repetitive task training has been shown to be effective in some&#xD;
      aspects of rehabilitation, such as improving walking distance and speed and improving upper&#xD;
      limb function (5).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this project, the investigators will use &quot;Gloreha ARIA&quot; (7) a new sensor-based therapy&#xD;
      device designed for motor recovery of impaired upper limb Gloreha Aria offers specific&#xD;
      programs that help patients to move arm, wrist and fingers. Therapists can customize therapy&#xD;
      by focusing on a specific motor task.&#xD;

      The hypothesis was that rehabilitation with this device could be not inferior in comparison&#xD;
      with hands-on physiotherapy, in the reeducation of upper arm in the patient affected by&#xD;
      stroke from cerebral ischemia or hemorrhage that had occurred â‰¤ 30 days before.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The principle purpose of this study will be to evaluate:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The feasibility of this new device&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Efficacy in improving arm function abilities in the rehabilitation of patients with&#xD;
           stroke in the sub-acute phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post-stroke patients admitted for inpatient rehabilitation to the Neurological Rehabilitation&#xD;
      will be screened for enrolment and randomized in a controlled trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All the patients will be informed about the aim and experimental procedures before enrolment,&#xD;
      thus written informed consent will be obtained from all of them. Patients included in the&#xD;
      study will be randomly assigned to intervention or control group according to simple&#xD;
      randomization technique (computerized random numbers).&#xD;

    <description>The specific hand intervention consisted of 30 sessions, lasting 60 min/ day, for 6 days/week. All patients will be educated by physiotherapist to perform the movements for wrist, hand and arm in complete autonomy.&#xD;
In Treatment Group, the movements will be performed using Gloreha ARIA. Gloreha Aria is a sensor-based therapy device designed for motor recovery of impaired upper limb. Gloreha Aria is equipped with sensors that can detect any movements in space: the software processes and displays them on the screen.</description>
