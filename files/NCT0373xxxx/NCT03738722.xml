    <textblock>
      The main objective of this explorative observational study is to investigate the pressures in&#xD;
      infraglottic airway and the pharynx provided by THRIVE , using flows ranging from 1l/min to&#xD;
      80 l/min, in patients hospitalized for elective surgical procedure; to investigate the&#xD;
      correlation between airway pressure and nasal oxygen flow.&#xD;

      Eligible adults with written informed consent will be monitored for general anaesthesia&#xD;
      according standard operating procedure of the Bern University Hospital's anaesthesia&#xD;
      department. Additional non-invasive monitoring for this study are transcutaneous measurement&#xD;
      of carbon dioxide and oxygen (TCM 5®, Radiometer, Krefeld, Germany), NarcotrendTM (&#xD;
      Narcotrend-Group, Hannover, Germany)and thoracic electrical impedance tomography (EIT,&#xD;
      PulmoVista® 500, Draeger, Luebeck, Germany).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Normal pre-oxygenation (until end expiratory carbon dioxide is &gt; 90% or time &gt; 3 minutes)&#xD;
      will occur. Anaesthesia will be started using a target -controlled infusion system for&#xD;
      Propofol and Remifentanil, using NarcotrendTM to measure depth of anaesthesia. All patients&#xD;
      will receive a standard dose of neuromuscular blockage to facilitate airway management and&#xD;
      total intravenous anaesthesia will be installed. Using the train of four measurement (TOF)&#xD;
      full neuromuscular blockage with Rocuronium will be confirmed every 30 seconds. After&#xD;
      administration of rocuronium, proper bag-mask ventilation will be confirmed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intratracheal pressure will be measured by 11 Fr. catheter (Cook Medical, Bloomington, IN,&#xD;
      USA), connected to a CODAN Xtrans®-transducer (CODAN ARGUS Ag, Baar, Switzerland). A 11 Fr.&#xD;
      catheter (Cook Medical, Bloomington, IN, USA) will be introduced oral in the trachea&#xD;
      facilitated by video-laryngoscopy. To ensure patency of the upper airway jaw thrust via&#xD;
      Esmarch manoeuvre will be applied and flexible bronchoscopy will confirm upper airway&#xD;
      patency. Initially this 11 Fr. catheter will be positioned in the right main bronchus (2 cm&#xD;
      below the carina). The first measurement will be performed with a randomized sequence of flow&#xD;
      rates of 80, 60, 40, 20 or 1 l/min with opened and closed mouth. Each pressure measurement&#xD;
      will be performed after a stable pressure plateau of 10 seconds will be observed. The&#xD;
      catheter will then be retracted and the pressure quantification are performed with the same&#xD;
      sequence, defined above, in different positions (50% of trachea length and pharyngeal&#xD;
      pressures 10 cm from upper front teeth). The order of flow and mouth opening will be&#xD;
      randomized.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study intervention will end when all measurements are taken or upper airway patency&#xD;
      cannot be ensured under direct endoscopy view. If one of the following criteria is met:&#xD;
      peripheral oxygen saturation (SpO2) &lt;92% or transcutaneous carbon dioxide (PtCO2) &gt;80mmHg,&#xD;
      immediately bag mask ventilation will be initiated, until normal values of SpO2 and PtCO2 are&#xD;
      reached.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When any of the end points is reached, normal anesthesiologic care will be established as&#xD;
      planned.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A safety interview will be conducted on the first post-operative day to evaluate injuries&#xD;
      during airway management (e.g. bleeding, sore throat, hoarseness, lip injuries), pain,&#xD;
      postoperative nausea and vomiting.&#xD;
