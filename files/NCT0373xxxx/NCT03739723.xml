  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Due to a number of factors, including power differentials and adverse events, residents are&#xD;
      susceptible to mistreatment (i.e., discrimination, harassment, and abuse) and toxic outcomes&#xD;
      (i.e., burnout, attrition, and suicide). Our subsequent work following the FIRST Trial&#xD;
      identified considerable variation in program-level rates of resident-reported burnout, severe&#xD;
      stress, gender discrimination, racial discrimination, sexual harassment, and verbal abuse. To&#xD;
      investigate these issues, the SECOND Trial will include a national mixed-methods analysis of&#xD;
      and a pragmatic randomized trial to improve resident program culture and wellness.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The prospective, pragmatic randomized trial will include approximately 320 surgical training&#xD;
      programs across the United States. Participating programs will be randomized to the&#xD;
      intervention or usual care arm. The intervention arm (vs. usual care) will receive&#xD;
      program-specific cultural outcomes reports and a Surgical Culture Toolkit at the start of the&#xD;
      trial as well as participate in Coaching Calls and In-Person Meetings to help facilitate and&#xD;
      support intervention uptake throughout the trial period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To assess the individual efficacy of the reports in regards to decreasing rates of&#xD;
      mistreatment and toxic outcomes, the reports will be given to programs approximately 2 months&#xD;
      to 6 months prior to toolkit dissemination. Prior to toolkit dissemination, programs will&#xD;
      have the opportunity to fully review the report, form internal teams to address the issues,&#xD;
      and mobilize necessary resources in preparation of receiving the toolkit. A comprehensive&#xD;
      list of all activities performed after report dissemination will be kept at a program level.&#xD;
      Toolkit dissemination to intervention programs will occur within 6 months of report&#xD;
      dissemination. Coaching Calls and In-Person/virtual Meetings will be held at a variety of&#xD;
      time points during the trial. The usual care arm will continue to perform their normal&#xD;
      quality improvement activities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will compare multiple postoperative outcomes between the two study arms&#xD;
      using data collected from an annual resident survey.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subsequent extensions of these work will include surgical subspecialty training programs&#xD;
      (e.g., vascular surgery, thoracic surgery). Eligible programs will be assigned in parallel to&#xD;
      the randomization scheme of corresponding programs at their institution. Similar&#xD;
      interventions and control protocols will be in-place for surgical subspecialties, with&#xD;
      modifications to investigate specialty-specific survey items and interventions.&#xD;
