      A tailored management of COPD patients would obviously allow to reduce costs for&#xD;
      hospitalizations and improve quality of life. This management could benefit of the&#xD;
      Information and Comunication Technology support, which can offer the possibility of&#xD;
      telemonitoring patients without the need of repeated hospital visits and improving the&#xD;
      efficacy of healthcare services. Moreover, the high frequency of exacerbations and their&#xD;
      often atypical clinical presentation in the aged patient make particularly desirable the&#xD;
      availability of a telemonitoring system which could guarantee continuous control and early&#xD;
      intervention in case of necessity. The aim of the present study is to test an innovative&#xD;
      telemonitoring system in patients with COPD.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a global health problem throughout the world.&#xD;
      It's not only the fourth cause of death with 600 million deaths every year, but it's also the&#xD;
      most rapidly increasing pathology in terms of mortality in industrialized countries and in&#xD;
      2020 it will become the second cause of death (WHO data). Moreover it's impact is largely&#xD;
      underestimated. Only one patient on four is diagnosed, often with delay, and this obviously&#xD;
      reduces therapeutic chance. Consequently, COPD is often identified and cured only in late&#xD;
      stages, while it constitutes an important health problem also in younger people (from 45-50&#xD;
      years). Recent studies estimated an average cost of 1.300 euro per patient every year, which&#xD;
      can increase to 7.000 euro in more severe stages. A tailored management of COPD patients&#xD;
      would obviously allow to reduce costs for hospitalizations and improve quality of life. This&#xD;
      management could benefit of the Information and Comunication Technology support, which can&#xD;
      offer the possibility of telemonitoring patients without the need of repeated hospital visits&#xD;
      and improving the efficacy of healthcare services. Moreover, the high frequency of&#xD;
      exacerbations and their often atypical clinical presentation in the aged patient make&#xD;
      particularly desirable the availability of a telemonitoring system which could guarantee&#xD;
      continuous control and early intervention in case of necessity. The use of telemonitoring&#xD;
      systems in COPD patients has already demonstrated a moderate efficacy in reducing&#xD;
      hospidalizations and other related outcomes (Pedone C et al. BMC Health Serv Res 2003), but&#xD;
      evidence is not homogeneous (Pedone C e Lelli D Pneumonol Alergol Pol 2015). A further&#xD;
      improvement of the impact of telemonitoring systems on health status of COPD patients could&#xD;
      derive from Decision Support System (DSS), able to predict clinical events (i.e.&#xD;
      exacerbations) and to assist healthcare providers in monitoring or predicting events on the&#xD;
      basis of variation of clinical parameters, not directly collected with conventional&#xD;
      strategies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our research group (L.I.A., Universit√† Campus Biomedico di Roma, Asl n. 4 Lanusei) has&#xD;
      already developed a predictive algorithm for exacerbations or clinical worrisome events&#xD;
      before the onset of symptoms. The project has been financed by Provincia Autonoma di Bolzano&#xD;
      (Italy) and presented at the IEEE-EMBS International Conference on Biomedical and Health&#xD;
      Informatics (BHI) in Las Vegas on February 24-27th 2016 [&quot;On the Remote Detection of&#xD;
      COPD-Related Worrisome Events&quot; - BHI 2016]. The full paper has been published on the IEEE&#xD;
      Journal of Biomedical and Health Informatics [&quot;A decision support system for tele-monitoring&#xD;
      COPD-related worrisome events&quot;] on March 2017.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exploiting our results, an innovative medical device for health status monitoring has been&#xD;
      developed to detect exacerbations or clinical worrisome events through the consideration of&#xD;
      early signs the patient is not still aware of and, accordingly, suggesting him to refer to&#xD;
      doctors before the onset of symptoms. The device is made up of a Bluetooth digital pulse&#xD;
      oximeter and of an APP. The APP connects with the pulse oximeter that measure heart rate and&#xD;
      blood oxygen saturation. The APP, at first, adapts to the physiological characteristics of&#xD;
      each patient, thus personalizing its responses, setting its own coefficients for the analysis&#xD;
      of the parameters used on the basis of the continuous flow of data received from the pulse&#xD;
      oximeter. The initial period of &quot;adaptation&quot; for the basic setting of the machine has been&#xD;
      estimated in 5 days, after which the device will continue to model itself on the patient both&#xD;
      through self-learning using the input data, and through a possible, but not obligatory,&#xD;
      intervention from medical doctors modifying the configuration parameters for a better&#xD;
      response from the machine. Our results suggest the algorithm is able to detect potentially&#xD;
      critical situations with a sensitivity index of 98% and a specificity of 100%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3. Study objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
      To test the algorithm on a larger population to verify the performance of the current system.&#xD;
      Based on the number of descriptors used by the system, considering a drop-off rate of 15%,&#xD;
      error margin of 0.02, p = 0.05, the number of patients enrolled is 120.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To train the algorithm for the recognition of exacerbations, defined as worsening of dyspnoea&#xD;
      or sputum of entities superior to the normal circadian variability and requiring treatment&#xD;
      modifications, ascertained through clinical evaluation; To calibrate and validate the&#xD;
      algorithm for recognition of exacerbation episodes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To evaluate the effectiveness of the system in terms of costs and quality of life of the&#xD;
      patient:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Efficacy:&#xD;
&#xD;
      it will be based on the comparison of the frequency of ER and hospital admissions in the&#xD;
      three years before the intervention and during the intervention period in order to verify the&#xD;
      expected decline in the need for extraordinary care. To this end, after authorization, the&#xD;
      File A and File L of the Scheda di Dimissione Ospedaliera (SDO) will be used. In this way,&#xD;
      all the data concerning ER and hospital admissions, causes and days of hospitalization will&#xD;
      be retrieved for each patients. A significant reduction in the cumulative frequency of the&#xD;
      outcome will be considered proof of efficacy. The comparison between the year of intervention&#xD;
      and the previous year will be supplemented by the analysis of the time series including the&#xD;
      previous 3 years and the intervention to avoid that an apparently significant difference&#xD;
      between the year of intervention and the previous year reflects only the evolution of a&#xD;
      trend. Moreover, since detected parameters can be modified also by incident not only&#xD;
      respiratory, but also of other origin (e.g. cardiac) pathology, the causes of ER or hospital&#xD;
      admissions will be detected and catalogued for the purpose of an analytical evaluation of the&#xD;
      effects of the intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      the analysis of objective outcomes, that are expression of the care needs (efficacy check 1),&#xD;
      will be complemented by that of the health effects expressed by a baseline and final&#xD;
      oligodimensional evaluation including a measure of dyspnea (MRC), a physical performance&#xD;
      index ( 6'WT), a personal autonomy scale (ADL, IADL) and a health status questionnaire&#xD;
      correlated with respiratory disease (CAT). Since there is no comparison for this outcome, the&#xD;
      same will be considered achieved in the case of stability of performance compared to&#xD;
      baseline.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cost/effectiveness: assuming a weighted average cost of hospitalization for exacerbated COPD&#xD;
      and estimating the cost of the proposed intervention (see the attached analytical scheme),&#xD;
      the intervention will be considered cost / effective if the savings achieved will exceed at&#xD;
      least 25% the expenditure incurred. This threshold, albeit arbitrary, is convenient and&#xD;
      reasonable because lower values could be penalized by variously localized defects in the&#xD;
      procedure for calculating the variables involved.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with COPD with frequent exacerbations will be enrolled regardless from bronchial&#xD;
      obstruction degree or GOLD stage. According to the 2018 GOLD guidelines, two or more&#xD;
      exacerbations every year or at least one leading to hospitalization are considered frequent.&#xD;
      Exacerbation means any change in respiratory health that requires a change in drug therapy,&#xD;
      regardless of the need for ER or hospital admission, which conversely characterize the&#xD;
      proportion of exacerbations constituting the first efficacy outcome. Patients in long-term&#xD;
      oxygen therapy, with cognitive impairment hampering, in the opinion of the investigator, the&#xD;
      possibility of adhering to the protocol and with a life expectancy limited to one year, will&#xD;
      be excluded. No other exclusion criteria will be foreseen, in particular co-morbidity, since&#xD;
      the study is designed for a real life dimension and the algorithm can be used to convey&#xD;
      information of interest for worsening of non-respiratory pathology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each patient will be provided with the BPCOmedia Kit for measuring the status of patient's&#xD;
      health COPD. The kit is composed of a Bluetooth pulse oximeter and an APP for Android system&#xD;
      downloadable from Google Play and installed on the Android smartphone of the patient from&#xD;
      version 4.1 on.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During sperimentation, a dedicated case manager nurse will care, for the professional team&#xD;
      leader (GP) and for the entire team where the specialist pneumologist is present, an&#xD;
      impartial and transversal approach for the development of a personalized treatment plan,&#xD;
      facilitating the coordination and appropriate use of the various services.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measurements of oxyhemoglobinic saturation and heart rate will be performed 3 times a day,&#xD;
      according to a predefined monitoring plan, and whenever the patient experiences symptoms. The&#xD;
      patient will firstly refer to the case manager nurse or to the GP, if the first is&#xD;
      unavailable, whenever the algorithm will detect a potentially dangerous situation or when its&#xD;
      perceived health status will deviate from measurement performed by the telemonitoring system.&#xD;
      On the other hand, the case manager nurse and the GP will daily monitor the parameters and&#xD;
      will evaluate if the received values are compatible with an ongoing or imminent deterioration&#xD;
      of the state of health (&quot;worrisome event&quot;). In this case, the patient will be contacted by&#xD;
      telephone to investigate the symptoms or the presence of signs of exacerbation (dyspnoea,&#xD;
      asthenia, increased secretions). On the basis of the obtained data, the worrisome event will&#xD;
      be reclassified as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      False alarm; Minor event (clinical worsening not requiring therapeutical intervention or&#xD;
      other interventions) Possible exacerbation. In case of possible exacerbation, the patient&#xD;
      will be visited by the GP who will establish the actual presence of an exacerbation (with&#xD;
      consequent modification of therapy, indication of further diagnostic investigations, or&#xD;
      sending to higher levels of treatment, depending on the indication), or reclassify the event&#xD;
      as &quot;Minor Event&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The pneumologist will be always available for the interpretation of situations involving&#xD;
      specialist knowledge and will be contacted by both the case manager nurse and the GP&#xD;
      depending on availability. In case of particular situations, for example important&#xD;
      desaturations, preferential routes will be activated so that the specialist pneumologist can&#xD;
      intervene promptly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to obtain a sufficient number of events for the objectives of the project, it is&#xD;
      planned to enroll at least 120 patients, who will be followed for a period of 12 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main outcome will be bronchial exacerbations, which are assumed to have a Poisson&#xD;
      distribution with an average of 2/patient/year. Considering as clinically significant a&#xD;
      reduction of 0.25 exacerbations/patient/year, using Lehr's equation with Type I and Type II&#xD;
      error of 5% and 20%, respectively, we obtain an estimate of the sample size of 480 people&#xD;
      followed for a year; it is considered appropriate to increase to 500 to offset any losses&#xD;
      during follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This sample size is also sufficient for the development of the event prediction algorithm: in&#xD;
      fact, based on the number of descriptors used by the system and considering a drop-off rate&#xD;
      of 15%, error margin of 0.02, p = 0.05 , the number of patients required is 120.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The instrumentation will be delivered within a training session in which the patient will be&#xD;
      instructed on the functioning of the telemonitoring system and on the behavior to be taken in&#xD;
      case of changes in health status.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Appropriate understanding will be verified at the end of the session, and the study staff&#xD;
      will offer the patient additional sessions even after some time in case of need.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patient will also be specified that the investigating system is not substitutive of the&#xD;
      usual assistance and that in case of any variation of the symptoms it is necessary to follow&#xD;
      the usual procedures by contacting the primary care physician or the specialist as needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will sign an informed consent. The telemonitoring system used is not intended as&#xD;
      a substitute for normal assistance and the study procedures do not provide emergency&#xD;
      interventions, therefore participants will be advised to contact their doctor for the&#xD;
      evaluation of any health problems and to activate the usual emergency procedures in case of&#xD;
      critical situations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data analysis Data will be analyzed according to descriptive statistics methods to evaluate&#xD;
      the performance, calculating accuracy, precision, specificity and sensitivity. Initially, the&#xD;
      training phase will use data from a reference population. Subsequently, using the leave-one&#xD;
      person out, the system training will be evaluated again using the data acquired during the&#xD;
      present experimentation, then proceeding to the estimate of the performances.&#xD;
&#xD;
      5. Telemonitoring system&#xD;
&#xD;
      Basic characteristics are summarized below:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The system consisting of the app and of a pulse oximeter and is certified as a medical device&#xD;
      (next June 2017); The patient receives a kit consisting of a pulse oximeter and the Android&#xD;
      app that can be downloaded from Google Play and can be installed on your Android smartphone&#xD;
      from version 4.1 and up; The patient uses the app to perform measurements at home, without&#xD;
      the need for external support; The app works in three modes: configuration, training /&#xD;
      calibration, monitoring; During configuration, the user creates an account associated with&#xD;
      the purchased pulse oximeter and the app, in order to reduce the abuse of the device by&#xD;
      people who have not purchased it; During the training phase, the app acquires the necessary&#xD;
      information to calibrate the algorithm and to make it able to identify the occurrence of one&#xD;
      of the aforementioned dangerous events; During the monitoring phase the patient uses the app&#xD;
      to monitor the onset of one of the aforementioned dangerous events; The user, using the&#xD;
      credentials provided during the configuration, can access a web portal called the patient&#xD;
      portal where he can check the history of the performed measurements; The patient portal&#xD;
      allows the end user to view their data in a graphical and intuitive form and to share&#xD;
      measurements with their doctor; Doctors access a portal dedicated to them and called the&#xD;
      medical portal; In the medical portal, the doctor can consult the measurements performed by&#xD;
      his patients provided that the patient has enabled the doctor to consult his data;&#xD;
      Possibility for the doctor to obtain reports of the measures performed by the patients; The&#xD;
      app and both the patient portal and the medical portal support the main European languages&#xD;
      starting from Italian and English.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Installation and configuration phase The user downloads the Android app from the Google Play&#xD;
      store. At the time of installation, the app guides the user to register a new account, if not&#xD;
      already in possession of one, and to register the pulse oximeter purchased, by entering the&#xD;
      alphanumeric commercial code available inside the package.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A single account can be linked to the commercial code.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the account creation and association with the pulse oximetry wizard, the app requires&#xD;
      the minimum information necessary for registration and user profiling:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Name and surname Email address Telephone number Username and password In order to proceed&#xD;
      with registration, the patient must view the privacy statement and consent to the processing&#xD;
      of personal health data as required by current legislation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of the installation / configuration phase the app starts in training / calibration&#xD;
      mode.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Training and calibration phase For the correct functioning, the app needs an initial training&#xD;
      phase of the predefined duration of N = 5 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The training phase is based on a monitoring plan consisting of three measurements / day&#xD;
      divided by predefined time period: morning, afternoon, evening. A measurement is required for&#xD;
      each time slot.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The monitoring plan includes a series of reminders that, through the push notification&#xD;
      associated with a sound signal, remind the patient of the measurements to be performed. The&#xD;
      monitoring plan can be consulted in read only on the app in a special section.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At each measurement indicated by M the app acquires the value of the percentage of hemoglobin&#xD;
      saturation SpO2, the value of the HR heart rate measured by the pulse oximeter and the date&#xD;
      and time when the measurement takes place. The input data are formally indicated with the&#xD;
      triad (SPO2, HR, t), where the value t indicates both the date and the time of measurement M&#xD;
      and therefore serves to classify the band of measurement: morning, afternoon, evening.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of the 5 days, ie of the training phase, using the measurements and a dataset of&#xD;
      patient profiles pre-stored in the APP, it is automatically passed during the monitoring&#xD;
      phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The APP displays in a special band always clearly visible the phase in which it finds:&#xD;
      training or monitoring.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the training phase, the app stores the data of the individual measurements and the&#xD;
      result of the calibration on the backend at the end of the training phase. The app also works&#xD;
      in an independent way from the backend so the data are synchronized in the background in a&#xD;
      transparent way to the user even in the absence of connectivity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Monitoring phase Once the training and calibration phase is complete, the app goes into the&#xD;
      monitoring phase in which the patient performs the measures to keep his health checked and&#xD;
      monitored.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The information to be memorized in this phase are:&#xD;
&#xD;
      HR heart rate; SpO2 hemoglobin saturation; Date and Time of detection According to the&#xD;
      monitoring plan, the app invites the user to perform the measurement by wearing and turning&#xD;
      on the pulse oximeter. Upon detection, the app alerts the user by inviting him to remove the&#xD;
      pulse oximeter. The single measurement, completely transparent to the user, is implemented as&#xD;
      a series of measures more appropriately filtered (indicatively the average of the&#xD;
      measurements performed in 5 - 10 seconds).&#xD;
&#xD;
      At each measurement, the app, received the parameters from the pulse oximeter, queries the&#xD;
      algorithm by sending SpO2, heart rate, date and time and displays the result of the&#xD;
      processing by the algorithm. This result is presented to the patient through easily&#xD;
      comprehensible text and with appropriate icons that provide a clear and immediate&#xD;
      understanding of the patient's state of health.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The app is able to perform the measurement even in the absence of connectivity, so all&#xD;
      configuration parameters (see monitoring plan) are stored locally to the app and from time to&#xD;
      time synchronized with what is present remotely to the backend.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the measurement, the parameters of the measurement itself and the result of the&#xD;
      processing are stored locally and, if possible, on the cloud. In case it is not possible to&#xD;
      immediately store them on the cloud due to lack of connection, the alignment of the data will&#xD;
      happen in a transparent way to the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The app also keeps a measurement history locally so as to allow the patient to consult the&#xD;
      measurements directly from the app. These measures are presented in tabular and graphic mode.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the monitoring phase the patient must have the possibility to contact the relative&#xD;
      doctor in case of a worsening of the perceived conditions and if he finds a disagreement&#xD;
      between his / her perceived condition and the result of the app. It is therefore possible&#xD;
      directly from the app to start a new training / training phase to recalibrate the algorithm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Settings The app provides a special section dedicated to personal settings. In this section&#xD;
      the patient can consult his personal data, the monitoring plan and perform a reset to restart&#xD;
      the training and calibration phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Algorithm library The algorithm is encapsulated in a library developed by the Biomedical&#xD;
      Campus of the University of Rome and owned by the L.I.A of Giuseppe Capasso.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients' interface&#xD;
&#xD;
      Using the credentials chosen during the initial configuration phase, the patient can access a&#xD;
      web portal dedicated to patients. After access to this portal the patient has the possibility&#xD;
      of:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Manage your personal data and change the password for accessing the portal and the app.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Consult the standard monitoring plan available as read-only. Consult the list of measurements&#xD;
      made and display them in graphical mode, with the possibility to filter and view them for&#xD;
      time periods.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Set up your own doctor with whom you can then share your monitoring data. The patient invites&#xD;
      the doctor to access his data in a manner similar to that used by the most common social&#xD;
      networks to share information.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Doctors' interface This portal allows treating physicians to access their patients' data via&#xD;
      the web. By following the appropriate link 'Register as a doctor on the login page of the&#xD;
      medical portal, the doctor can register at the portal. The activation must take place after&#xD;
      adequate verification by the administrators, who may request further documentation to&#xD;
      ascertain the identity of the doctor requesting registration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once registered, the doctor can use his credentials to access the portal where he can manage&#xD;
      his personal data entered during registration and access the measurements of patients who&#xD;
      have shared access. The doctor can in turn search for patients and send a request for access&#xD;
      to data. The patient can then accept the request or not.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The doctor can not make any changes to the patient's data, he has them read-only. There are&#xD;
      known fields where you can enter other information deriving from a medical history or a&#xD;
      visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Doctors' interface - specific features In order to support the achievement of the objectives&#xD;
      of the study / experimentation, a series of functionalities are foreseen in order to collect&#xD;
      a set of &quot;certain&quot; data, that is validated by the doctor near the detected measure so that&#xD;
      the same doctor has the possibility to confront the patient and confirm or redirect the&#xD;
      result generated by the algorithm. From a technical point of view it is about collecting the&#xD;
      data sent by the app in the backend but allows the doctor to confirm the data or reclassify&#xD;
      the result that, according to his opinion, should have been generated. Therefore, as already&#xD;
      foreseen, the doctor will access the back end with the possibility to select the patient in&#xD;
      question, to examine the measures interested in the judgment confirming the outcome or&#xD;
      modifying it according to a series of labels that will be indicated by the scientific&#xD;
      committee.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The information can then be extracted ad hoc and provided for analysis at the Biomedical&#xD;
      Campus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Working scheme The following diagram represents the logical architecture of the whole system.&#xD;
      The diagram also shows which parts reside in the smartphone (Smarpthone area) and which are&#xD;
      instead ancillary components that reside in the web (Web area). It is important to keep in&#xD;
      mind that the medical device consists of the app and the algorithm included in the area&#xD;
      marked as Smartphone. The users of the system are the patient and the doctor. The patient&#xD;
      uses the smartphone for monitoring and consultation, while the web part is used for simple&#xD;
      consultation both by the patient and by the doctor in the appropriate web portals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Principal components are described below.&#xD;
&#xD;
      App This represents the app installed in the patient's smartphone. The app receives&#xD;
      measurements from the pulse oximetry during the monitoring phase and interacts with the&#xD;
      predictive algorithm to determine the patient's health status. The data useful for processing&#xD;
      health status and for consultation are then saved in a local database so that you can work&#xD;
      independently from the web-side connectivity. The app interacts with the backend for the sole&#xD;
      purpose of saving measurements and health data remotely.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Predictive algorithm Although it is physically integrated into the app, the algorithm is&#xD;
      locally a block in itself, given its criticality. The app takes care of managing the time&#xD;
      slots of the measures based on the monitoring plan and to call accordingly the predictive&#xD;
      algorithm passing the information collected by the pulse oximeter and other information&#xD;
      processed from the historical data stored in the local database. Starting from this&#xD;
      information, the algorithm determines the patient's health status.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Local database The local database is used by the app to maintain locally the necessary&#xD;
      measures in the first instance to the algorithm to perform the processing and to determine&#xD;
      the health status of the patient, and secondly to allow the patient to consult the previous&#xD;
      measures directly on the smartphone . For the correct processing the algorithm requires the&#xD;
      measurements of the last 90 days. These are the measures stored in the local database.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pulse oximeter. It is the medical device used by the patient to perform the measurement of&#xD;
      SpO2 and heart rate. Interacts via bluetooth with the app to share the measurement performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Backend&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is the remote hardware / software component on which the measurements made by the&#xD;
      various patients and the patient profiles are saved. Here the data are stored in a remote&#xD;
      database and are always available to be downloaded on smartphones in case of need, to be&#xD;
      consulted by patients and doctors through the appropriate portals, or to be used by&#xD;
      researchers of the Rome Biomedical Campus to refine and further develop the algorithm. The&#xD;
      following section dedicated to the detailed architecture will also describe the various&#xD;
      protocols used for the interaction with the other components of the system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Remote Database Remote database on which patient measurements and patient and medical profile&#xD;
      data are saved.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Web interface These are the components of the system that allow patients and physicians to&#xD;
      consult the data stored in the backend.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Structure The following diagram represents the physical architecture of the whole system and&#xD;
      how the components of the whole system interact / communicate with each other.&#xD;
