  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase I trial studies how well atezolizumab before and/or with standard of care&#xD;
      chemoradiotherapy works in immune system activation in patients with stage IB2, II, IIIB, or&#xD;
      IVA cervical cancer that has spread to the lymph nodes. Immunotherapy with monoclonal&#xD;
      antibodies, such as atezolizumab, may help the body's immune system attack the cancer, and&#xD;
      may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Giving atezolizumab before&#xD;
      and/or with chemoradiotherapy may lower the chance of tumors growing or spreading.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine whether differences in sequencing of atezolizumab and chemoradiation result&#xD;
      in differential immune activation, as determined by clonal expansion of T cell receptor beta&#xD;
      (TCRB) repertoires in peripheral blood on day 21.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To investigate the feasibility of administration of the anti PD-L1 antibody (atezolizumab)&#xD;
      as an immune primer and concurrent with chemoradiation (CRT) therapy in patients with locally&#xD;
      advanced cervical cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To determine the nature and degree of toxicity of the anti PD-L1 antibody (atezolizumab)&#xD;
      administered as an immune primer and concurrent with chemoradiation (CRT) therapy in patients&#xD;
      with locally advanced cervical cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To examine the changes in T cell receptor (TCR) clonality, diversity, and frequency in&#xD;
      peripheral blood and tissue and correlate this with clinical outcomes, such as the&#xD;
      exploratory response assessment on the post-treatment positron emission tomography&#xD;
      (PET)-computed tomography (CT) scan and 2-year disease-free survival (DFS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To assess the predictive value of baseline and on-treatment PD-L1 expression in the&#xD;
      tissue in each treatment arm for clinical outcomes using post-treatment PET-CT scan and&#xD;
      2-year DFS as the outcome measures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To explore baseline and on-treatment blood and tissue biomarkers that could predict&#xD;
      response to the combination therapy, as correlated to the exploratory clinical endpoint of&#xD;
      the week 12 (day 140) PET-CT scan and 2-year DFS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To explore the response assessment on the exploratory and optional post-treatment week 12&#xD;
      (day 140) PET-CT scan and the clinical 2-year disease free survival (DFS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM A: Patients receive atezolizumab intravenously (IV) over 30-60 minutes on days -21, 0,&#xD;
      and 21 in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients also receive&#xD;
      standard of care cisplatin chemotherapy IV over 90 minutes on days 0, 7, 14, 21, 28, and 35.&#xD;
      Beginning on day 0, patients also receive standard of care radiation therapy once daily&#xD;
      (Monday-Friday) for a total of 25 fractions with image guided brachytherapy beginning in week&#xD;
      4, 5, or at the end of radiation therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM B: Patients receive atezolizumab IV over 30-60 minutes on days 0, 21, and 42 in the&#xD;
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients also receive standard of&#xD;
      care cisplatin chemotherapy, radiation therapy, and image guided brachytherapy as in Arm A.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 1 and 3 months, and then&#xD;
      every 3 months for 2 years.&#xD;

             potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Because there is an unknown but&#xD;
             potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the&#xD;
             mother with atezolizumab, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is&#xD;

             dose of the study agent. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant&#xD;
