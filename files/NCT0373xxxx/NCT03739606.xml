    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well flotetuzumab works in treating patients with CD123&#xD;
      positive blood cancer that has come back or does not respond to treatment. Immunotherapy with&#xD;
      monoclonal antibodies, such as flotetuzumab, may help the body's immune system attack the&#xD;
      cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Evaluate the anti-tumor activity of flotetuzumab in CD123-positive advanced acute&#xD;
      lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) (Cohort A) and other hematological malignancies (Cohort B), as&#xD;
      assessed by complete remission (complete remission [CR]/complete remission with incomplete&#xD;
      count recovery [CRi]/complete remission with partial hematological recovery [CRh]) rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Evaluate toxicity profile of flotetuzumab. II. Evaluate remission duration among&#xD;
      responders. III. Estimate 1-year overall survival. IV. Evaluate minimal residual disease&#xD;
      (MRD) status in responders in the ALL cohort.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. Evaluate the percentage of patients who receive subsequent allogeneic transplantation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Examine immune profile pre- and post-treatment with flotetuzumab. II. Assess the&#xD;
      association between CD123 expression and tumor response. III. Assess the association between&#xD;
      alterations in tumor genetic or microenvironment with response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. Assess cytokine levels during therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive flotetuzumab intravenously (IV) continuously for 28 days. Patients who&#xD;
      achieve partial response or stable disease or any clinical benefit (partial remission [PR],&#xD;
      stable disease [SD]) that did not meet CR, CRi, CRh or morphologic leukemia free state (MLFS)&#xD;
      criteria receive a second 28-day continuous flotetuzumab IV infusion. Patients who achieve&#xD;
      CR/CRi/CRh/MLFS after course 1 or course 2 receive flotetuzumab IV at a 4 days on-3 days off&#xD;
      schedule. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 6 courses in the absence of disease&#xD;
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days and then up to 1&#xD;
      year.&#xD;
