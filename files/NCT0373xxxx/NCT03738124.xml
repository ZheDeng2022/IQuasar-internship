  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To ensure adequate seal of currently available stent grafts, a proximal 20 mm of healthy&#xD;
      aorta is recommended. Extending the proximal landing zone into the arch by intentional&#xD;
      covering of the left subclavian artery (LSA) without revascularization expose to serious&#xD;
      neurologic complications. Serious risks are also known to accompany subclavian&#xD;
      revascularization. The Valiant Mona LSA Thoracic Stent Graft System (Medtronic,Santa Rosa,&#xD;
      Calif) consists of a main stent graft and a branch stent graft designed to maintain LSA&#xD;
      patency. The purpose of this study is to characterize the safety and effectiveness of this&#xD;
      device for the treatment of Aneurysms and chronic Type B dissections of the arch.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Stent graft coverage of the left subclavian artery (LSA) may be required to achieve an&#xD;
      adequate landing zone in up to 40% of descending thoracic aneurysms (DTAs). To ensure&#xD;
      adequate seal of currently available off-the-shelf stent grafts, 20 mm of healthy aorta is&#xD;
      recommended between the proximal neck of the aneurysm and the leading edge of the stent&#xD;
      graft. Stent graft placement can be facilitated by extending the proximal landing zone into&#xD;
      the arch and covering the LSA; however, there may be a higher risk of serious neurologic&#xD;
      outcomes (cerebral and paraplegia), although this is still a matter of debate. Serious risks&#xD;
      are also known to accompany subclavian revascularization, which may involve bypass or&#xD;
      transposition. The Valiant Mona LSA Thoracic Stent Graft System (Medtronic,Santa Rosa, Calif)&#xD;
      consists of a main stent graft and a branch stent graft designed to maintain LSA patency&#xD;
      while diverting circulation through the encroaching aneurysm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of the feasibility study is to characterize the safety of the Valiant Mona LSA&#xD;
      Thoracic Stent Graft System, including an assessment of the safety and effectiveness of the&#xD;
      device acutely and at the 1-month visit in the identified subject population (Aneurysms and&#xD;
      chronic, Type B dissections). A follow up of this population will be annually during 5 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This pilot, non-randomized, single-arm prospective study will concern 20 patients. Inclusion&#xD;
      criteria required patients with a thoracic aortic aneurysm (TAA) or dissection with an&#xD;
      indication of a stent-Graft insertion. Primary end points will be aneurysm-related mortality,&#xD;
      stroke, paraplegia, left arm/hand ischemia, and treatment success. Technical success will be&#xD;
      assessed by imaging at 1 month, 6 months then annually during 5 years.&#xD;

    <description>The Valiant Mona LSA device is a modular two-component system consisting of a main stent graft (MSG) and a branch stent graft (BSG), delivered separately, designed to maintain LSA perfusion. Briefly, under general anesthesia and after heparin injection, a MSG access is achieved via a femoral artery. A Through-and-through wire access for delivery of the BSG is achieved via a brachial artery. After the placement of the main aortic stent graft in the arch with the cuff at the level of the ostium of the LSA, the BSG is placed through a femoral access.</description>
