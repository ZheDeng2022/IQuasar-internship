  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase one study investigating the safety and efficacy profile of allogeneic cord&#xD;
      blood hematopoietic progenitor cells (HPC, Cord Blood), when administered by intravenous&#xD;
      infusion and intrathecal injection, in subjects who have sustained an acute ischemic stroke&#xD;
      within the past 9 days. Treatment period consisting of 3 sessions of both intravenous&#xD;
      infusion and intrathecal injection (or intravenous infusion in conjunction with mannitol for&#xD;
      subjects unable to tolerate intrathecal injection). Follow-up phone calls for adverse event&#xD;
      (AE) assessment will be conducted at 1 week, 1 month, and 2 months after the first&#xD;
      intravenous/intrathecal treatment. A follow up clinic visit at 3 months, 6 months and 12&#xD;
      months will include a neurological exam, MRI, and clinical laboratory tests/urinalysis.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the safety of HPC, Cord Blood (administered&#xD;
      via intravenous infusion and intrathecal injection, or intravenous infusion in conjunction&#xD;
      with mannitol for subjects unable to tolerate intrathecal injection) in subjects with acute&#xD;
      ischemic stroke. The secondary objective is to evaluate the efficacy of HPC, Cord Blood (as&#xD;
      assessed by changes in neurological tests and cerebral infarct volume as measured by&#xD;
      diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)) in subjects with acute ischemic stroke.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a prospective, open-label, single-center, exploratory clinical study in subjects ≥ 18&#xD;
      years of age who have sustained a recent ischemic stroke. A total of 10 subjects will be&#xD;
      enrolled. Subjects will be given a series of baseline neurological assessments, blood tests,&#xD;
      and MRI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All subjects will be administered only ABO- and Rh-matched units of HPC, Cord Blood. Subjects&#xD;
      will not be matched for human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-typing. For each administration of HPC,&#xD;
      cord blood, the total dose (2.5 × 10^7 cells/kg; 150 × 10^7 cells) will be split for&#xD;
      intrathecal injection followed immediately by intravenous infusion. HPC, Cord Blood will be&#xD;
      administered via intravenous infusion and intrathecal injection, in subjects who have&#xD;
      sustained an acute ischemic stroke within the past 9 days. Intravenous infusion in&#xD;
      conjunction with mannitol will be used in instances where a subject is unable to tolerate&#xD;
      intrathecal administration. Treatment period consisting of 3 sessions, timed 5 to 12 days&#xD;
      apart. Subjects will be monitored for 6 hours post-infusion, and follow up will occur 24&#xD;
      hours after each therapy session. Follow-up phone calls for adverse event (AE) assessment&#xD;
      will be conducted at 1 week, 1 month, and 2 months after the first intravenous/intrathecal&#xD;
      treatment. A follow up clinic visit at 2 weeks, 3 months, 6 months, and 12 months after the&#xD;
      first intravenous/intrathecal treatment will include a neurological exam, MRI, and clinical&#xD;
      laboratory tests/urinalysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Risks of cord blood infusion include infusion-related reactions such as anaphylaxis,&#xD;
      urticaria, dyspnea, hypoxia, cough, wheezing, bronchospasm, nausea, vomiting, hives, fever,&#xD;
      hypertension, hypotension, bradycardia, tachycardia, rigors, chills, infection, and&#xD;
      hemoglobinuria. Less likely, long-term risks include transmission of infection or Graft vs&#xD;
      Host Disease.&#xD;
