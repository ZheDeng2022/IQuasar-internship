  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Bronchiectasis is a common chronic lung condition where patients have permanent airways&#xD;
      damage leading to daily symptoms of cough, sputum production and recurrent respiratory tract&#xD;
      infections.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preliminary studies in our research group have found a severe deficiency of the immune system&#xD;
      as a rare cause of bronchiectasis (called immunoglobulin G subclass 2 deficiency) and occurs&#xD;
      in about 1 in 20 bronchiectasis patients. The pilot work shows that these patients have more&#xD;
      chest infections and their lung function deteriorates more rapidly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are no trials to date to guide doctors to decide whether we should replace this&#xD;
      deficiency from donated blood or not. The aim with treatment is to prevent disease&#xD;
      progression and avoid the need for long term antibiotics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This trial will help us understand how this treatment works and its acceptability to&#xD;
      patients. This study will help us decide whether investigators should pursue future&#xD;
      formalised trials in many centres throughout the UK and how investigators should evaluate&#xD;
      such a treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We are looking to recruit 20 patients to this study 10 of which will receive weekly&#xD;
      replacement therapy and the remaining 10 will receive standard care.&#xD;

      Background What is bronchiectasis? Bronchiectasis is a chronic disabling condition due to&#xD;
      permanently inflamed and damaged airways with patients suffering chronic cough, chronic&#xD;
      sputum production and recurrent infections affecting 4-6 per 1,000 populations in the UK.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Causes of bronchiectasis There are a variety of causes of bronchiectasis with past infection&#xD;
      being the commonest cause (29-42%). In about 30-53% no cause can be identified in&#xD;
      bronchiectasis. National guidelines recommend screening for causes that are potentially&#xD;
      treatable including immune deficiency, allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis, active&#xD;
      environmental bacterial infection and cystic fibrosis as they all have therapies that may&#xD;
      alter the disease progression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Immunoglobulins in bronchiectasis Immunoglobulin A (IgA) and Immunoglobulin G (IgG) are the&#xD;
      most common antibodies found in the lung, where they opsonize pathogens and protect the body&#xD;
      from infection together with neutrophils and macrophages. Most bronchiectasis patients show&#xD;
      higher than normal IgG and IgA antibody levels, which reflects the high degree of recurrent&#xD;
      lung infections and chronic inflammation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IgG has four subclasses (1-4), which bind to and opsonize different kinds of antigens. IgG2&#xD;
      primarily binds polysaccharides and carbohydrates that are found in bacterial capsules, the&#xD;
      cell wall in gram-positive bacteria and the O-antigen of lipopolysaccharides found on the&#xD;
      outer membrane of gram-negative bacteria, which makes IgG2 an important part of bacterial&#xD;
      clearance in the lung.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The frequency of IgG2 deficiency in the general healthy population lies between 2 to 20% (N =&#xD;
      106). Paediatric studies show IgG2 deficiency was the most frequent IgG subclass deficiency,&#xD;
      and in their study 10% already had bronchiectasis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Studies to date investigating the frequency of IgG2 deficiency in bronchiectasis have been&#xD;
      small in 56, 65 and 89 patients with IgG2 subclass deficiency varying between 5 and 29%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis/Rationale Immunoglobulin replacement therapy is recommended for IgG deficiency&#xD;
      such as common variable immunodeficiency or agammaglobulinaemia to reduce infections but&#xD;
      there is international debate whether patients with IgG subclass deficiency should be offered&#xD;
      such treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesis is that IgG replacement therapy will benefit IgG2 deficient&#xD;
      patients with bronchiectasis by reducing the bacterial burden in the airways and reducing the&#xD;
      time to first exacerbation and reducing the overall exacerbation frequency.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY DESIGN This will be an open labelled proof of concept randomised controlled trial in 20&#xD;
      patients- 10 will receive weekly subcutaneous IgG replacement therapy for 52 weeks and the&#xD;
      other group no added treatment to standard care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The technician will be blinded to the patient's treatment. The investigators have chosen the&#xD;
      minimum patients per group to assess study feasibility and endpoints on mechanism and&#xD;
      efficacy will help on deciding the endpoint and power of this endpoint for a future&#xD;
      Randomised Controlled Trial (RCT).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be assessed at the following time points.&#xD;
&#xD;
      BASELINE Following confirmation of eligibility, participants will be invited to attend a&#xD;
      baseline visit (this must take place within 8 weeks of screening).&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the baseline visit, participants will be randomised to remain on standard care alone or to&#xD;
      receive standard care plus 52 weekly infusions of Cuvitru.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A trial diary will be provided to participant of both groups and the following assessments&#xD;
      will be made:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  24 hour sputum sample&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Induced sputum sample&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Lung function assessment&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Incremental Shuttle Walk Test&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood samples (approximately 80 ml)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Questionnaires&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Adverse Events&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Concomitant Medications&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Sample pot provided for 24 hour sputum sample (week 26)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pregnancy Test (women of child bearing potential only)&#xD;
&#xD;
      For those randomised to the interventional group, weight will be measured and training will&#xD;
      be provided to permit self-administration of the IMP at home. The first infusion of IMP will&#xD;
      take place at the baseline visit. Weekly infusion visits will continue to take place at the&#xD;
      Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh until the participant has been deemed competent to&#xD;
      self-administer at home. At such time, sufficient IMP (and contingency supply) will be&#xD;
      dispensed to permit weekly infusions until the Week 13 visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      WEEKLY All participants will complete their diary on at least a weekly basis to record&#xD;
      adverse events, exacerbations and concomitant medications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once competent, participants randomised to IgG replacement therapy will self-administer a&#xD;
      weekly infusion of IMP at home (7±2 days following previous infusion). The date of infusion&#xD;
      will be recorded in the diary and the vial sticker attached to document IMP use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      WEEK 13 (IgG Replacement Therapy Group Only) Participants will be asked to attend the&#xD;
      hospital for an infusion visit 13 weeks (±2 weeks) following the baseline visit. A pregnancy&#xD;
      test will be repeated for women of childbearing potential. Self-administration competency&#xD;
      will be assessed during IMP infusion. Used/partially used vials of IMP and needles will be&#xD;
      returned to the research team for destruction according to local policy. A 3 month supply of&#xD;
      IMP (with contingency, if required) and necessary consumables will be dispensed. The&#xD;
      completed diary will be returned to the research team and a new diary issued.&#xD;
&#xD;
      WEEK 26&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will attend a visit at 26 weeks (±2 weeks) following baseline. The following&#xD;
      assessment will take place:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  24 hour sputum sample&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Induced sputum sample&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Lung function assessment&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Incremental Shuttle Walk Test (ISWT)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood samples (approximately 80 ml)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Questionnaires&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Adverse Events&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Concomitant Medications&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Sample pot provided for 24 sputum sample (week 52)&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will return their completed trial diary to the research team and be issued a&#xD;
      new one.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For participants in the IgG replacement therapy group only, self-administration competency&#xD;
      will be assessed during IMP infusion. A pregnancy test will be repeated for women of&#xD;
      childbearing potential. Used/partially used vials of IMP and needles will be returned to the&#xD;
      research team for destruction according to local policy. A 3 month supply of IMP (with&#xD;
      contingency, if required) and necessary consumables will be dispensed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      WEEK 39 (IgG Replacement Therapy Group Only) Participants will be asked to attend the&#xD;
      hospital for an infusion visit 39 weeks (±2 weeks) following the baseline visit. A pregnancy&#xD;
      test will be repeated for women of childbearing potential. Self-administration competency&#xD;
      will be assessed during IMP infusion. Used/partially used vials of IMP and needles will be&#xD;
      returned to the research team for destruction according to local policy. A 3 month supply of&#xD;
      IMP (with contingency, if required) and necessary consumables will be dispensed. The&#xD;
      completed diary will be returned to the research team and a new diary issued.&#xD;
&#xD;
      WEEK 52&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will attend the final visit at 52 weeks (or at a maximum of 54 weeks) following&#xD;
      baseline. The following assessment will take place:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  24 hour sputum sample&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Induced sputum sample&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Lung function assessment&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Incremental Shuttle Walk Test (ISWT)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood samples (approximately 80 ml)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Questionnaires&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Adverse Events&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Concomitant Medications&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will return their completed trial diary to the research team.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For participants in the IgG replacement therapy group only, all trial equipment will be&#xD;
      returned to the research team. All used/partially used vials of IMP and needles will be&#xD;
      returned to the research team for destruction according to local policy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      FOLLOW-UP 4 weeks (to a maximum of 5 weeks) following the 52 week visit, the research team&#xD;
      will contact the participant by telephone to record any adverse events that have taken place&#xD;
      since the previous visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This telephone call will be the last contact from the research team. Participants will then&#xD;
      return to routine clinical care.&#xD;
