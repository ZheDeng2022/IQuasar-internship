  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this study is to examine the efficacy and safety of E6011 at 12 weeks&#xD;
      after administration by means of double-blind placebo-controlled trial.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Participants with moderate to severe Crohn's disease will be enrolled in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will include screening period, remission-induction period (double-blind), rescue&#xD;
      period (open-label), extension period (open-label), post-observation period, and a follow-up&#xD;
      period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of remission-induction period, participants with reduction in Crohn's disease&#xD;
      activity index (CDAI) score of 70 points or more when compared to baseline will move on to&#xD;
      the open-label extension period, and participants with less than 70 points reduction in CDAI&#xD;
      score will move on to the rescue period. At the end of the rescue period, participants with a&#xD;
      reduction in the CDAI of 70 points or more will move on to the open-label extension period&#xD;
      and with less than 70 points reduction in the CDAI score will be discontinued.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The post-observation period will include in-person assessment after the completion or&#xD;
      discontinuation of the extension period, and participants will be contacted by telephone,&#xD;
      etc. after the last dose of study drug administration. Participants will be contacted over&#xD;
      phone after the last dose of study drug administration for follow up assessments.&#xD;
