      The overall objective of this study is to acquire ultrasound images, spectral data and&#xD;
      prostate tissue biopsy cores using the ClariCore System via a transperineal approach.&#xD;
      Ultrasound images corresponding to each needle insertion and T2-weighted MR scans will be&#xD;
      saved for the purpose of further algorithm development that will provide physicians with real&#xD;
      time tissue classification in conjunction with location information from the ultrasound&#xD;
      imaging.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Males per Investigator assessment appropriate for transperineal prostate biopsy&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Patient scheduled for transperineal prostate biopsy based on standard of care urologic&#xD;
             requirements to assess for tissue malignancy&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Prostate volume &gt; 20cc and length at least 22mm as verified by ultrasound or prostate&#xD;
             MRI prior to the procedure&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Patient must be able to provide legal consent and signs an IRB (Institutional Review&#xD;
             Board)/EC (Ethics Committee) approved Informed Consent form to participate in the&#xD;
             study prior to any study mandated determinations or procedure&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Any anatomical or co-morbidity contraindications to transperineal prostate biopsy or&#xD;
             transperineal prostate mapping biopsy&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Acute painful perianal disorder (i.e. rectal abscess)&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Symptomatic, acute prostatitis&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Surgical absence of a rectum or the presence of a rectal fistula&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Patient has systemic infection or evidence of any surgical site infection (superficial&#xD;
             or organ space), including active urinary tract infection&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Previous prostate intervention [TURP (bipolar, monopolar, laser)] TUMT, HIFU, Cryo,&#xD;
             Rezum, Urolift], not including previous prostate biopsy&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Current required use of blood thinning agents for medical comorbidity which prohibits&#xD;
             the cessation of use as typically required per standard of care (SOC) prior to a&#xD;
             medical procedure; or history of a bleeding disorder (e.g. coagulopathy)&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Prior pelvic irradiation&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Actively receiving therapy for the treatment of cancer (except for patients on 5-alpha&#xD;
             reductase inhibitors, or non-melanoma skin cancers that are managed nonsystemically)&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Actively receiving intravesical therapy or within 6 months of treatment for bladder&#xD;
             cancer&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Patient has compromised immune system, in the opinion of the Investigator&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Active inflammatory bowel disease within the last 6 months&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. Any condition, or history of illness or surgery that, in the opinion of the&#xD;
             Investigator, might confound the results of the study or pose additional risks to the&#xD;
             patient (e.g.&#xD;
&#xD;
             significant cardiovascular conditions or allergies)&#xD;
&#xD;
         14. Patient is not likely to comply with the protocol or follow up evaluation&#xD;
&#xD;
         15. Patient is participating in a clinical trial of another investigational drug or device&#xD;
             that may impact participation in this clinical study&#xD;
