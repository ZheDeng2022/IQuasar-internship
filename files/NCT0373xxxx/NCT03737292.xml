  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess pharmacokinetics of liposomal bupivacaine (Exparel)&#xD;
      after multilevel intercostal injections of this local anesthetic for pain control during and&#xD;
      after thoracoscopic surgeries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The specific aim of this study is to evaluate plasma concentration of bupivacaine after&#xD;
      intraoperative intercostal injections of 266 mg of liposomal bupivacaine and compare it to&#xD;
      plasma concentrations of bupivacaine after intercostal injections of 2mg/kg of 0.5% plain&#xD;
      Bupivacaine with maximal dose of 30 ml or 150 mg.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis of the study is that plasma concentration of bupivacaine after intercostal&#xD;
      injections of 266 mg of liposomal bupivacaine will be similar to concentrations after&#xD;
      injections of plain bupivacaine, and will remain below the toxic level threshold range of&#xD;
      2000-3000 ng/mL (2-3 mg/L) at which central nervous system and cardiovascular adverse events&#xD;
      would be expected to occur.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objective is to evaluate if intercostal injections of 266 mg of liposomal&#xD;
      bupivacaine will significantly reduce opioid consumption and postsurgical pain, within the&#xD;
      first 48 hours and up to 3 months after minimally invasive thoracic surgeries, to determine&#xD;
      if both acute and chronic post-thoracotomy pain can be decreased by intraoperative&#xD;
      intercostal injections of liposomal bupivacaine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additionally, the rate of pneumonia, the rate of atrial fibrillation and length of hospital&#xD;
      stay will be assessed as secondary outcomes after thoracic surgeries. These outcomes can be&#xD;
      affected by the level of postoperative pain and inflammation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Significance of this study: If positive, the results of this research have the potential to&#xD;
      significantly improve pain management after thoracoscopic surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on prior experience, prolonged analgesia after liposomal bupivacaine injection is safe,&#xD;
      and may help reduce perioperative opioid consumption and decrease opioid related&#xD;
      complications. It will improve patient comfort, eliminate need for indwelling neuraxial&#xD;
      catheters and risks associated with them.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Liposomal bupivacaine is a relatively new drug formulation. Its safety and side effect&#xD;
      profile after intercostal injection has not been extensively studied. Most of the data comes&#xD;
      from studies where the medicine was used for wound infiltrations and peripheral nerve blocks&#xD;
      for orthopedic surgeries, or from preclinical volunteer studies. PK profile of Exparel varies&#xD;
      significantly with different blocks and administration techniques. Very few data are&#xD;
      available about pharmacokinetics of the drug after intercostal injections.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Because Exparel contains plain bupivacaine in a liposomal form, it allows for a slower&#xD;
      release of the medication from the injection site into the blood stream, and prolongs the&#xD;
      duration of action of this local anesthetic. During intercostal infiltration, a local&#xD;
      anesthetic is injected into a highly vascular area with increased rate of intravascular&#xD;
      absorption and potential risk of toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Also, because liposomal formulation provides a slow release of local anesthetic, the maximum&#xD;
      recommended dose of Exparel (266mg) for intercostal injections is higher than a maximum&#xD;
      recommended dose for plain bupivacaine (150mg), which can theoretically increase the risk of&#xD;
      local anesthetic toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The plan of this s to analyze a pharmacokinetic profile and safety of liposomal bupivacaine&#xD;
      compared with plain bupivacaine HCl. it is understood that absolute numbers can differ&#xD;
      because the doses of the two formulations are different. Unfortunately, the dose of plain&#xD;
      bupivacaine cannot be increased to match the dose of Exparel because of the risk of toxicity.&#xD;
      The dose of Exparel should not be lowered, because lower doses have been shown to be less&#xD;
      effective and are not clinically used at Hershey Medical Center.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on prior experience, it is known that prolonged analgesia after Exparel injection is&#xD;
      safe, and can help reduce perioperative opioid consumption and decrease opioid related&#xD;
      complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goal of this study is to demonstrate that despite the higher total dose of bupivacaine&#xD;
      administered via Exparel formulation as an intercostal injection, maximal plasma&#xD;
      concentration will remain within therapeutic levels of 700-1,000 ng/mL, and below toxic level&#xD;
      threshold range of 2000-3000 ng/mL at which central nervous system and cardiovascular adverse&#xD;
      events would be expected to occur. As a result, many more patients in the future can benefit&#xD;
      from a wider use of Exparel for pain management after thoracic surgeries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pneumonia and atrial fibrillation are well known complications of thoracic surgeries. The&#xD;
      etiology of atrial fibrillation after lung resection involves a combination of postoperative&#xD;
      hyperadrenergic activity and atrial dilatation. Increased vagal tone, atrial inflammation,&#xD;
      pulmonary hypertension, hypoxemia, or infection may also contribute. Preclinical studies have&#xD;
      shown a multitude of interactions between local anesthetics and the inflammatory system. It&#xD;
      is known that proinflammatory effects are attenuated by perioperative intravenous lidocaine&#xD;
      infusion via blocking the process of priming of polymorphonuclear granulocytes (PMN). Since&#xD;
      pneumonia and atrial fibrillation after thoracic surgery can be attributed in part to&#xD;
      inflammation, the hypothesis is that liposomal bupivacaine, due to higher concentration and&#xD;
      longer duration of action, can decrease incidence of these complications and improve hospital&#xD;
      length of stay.&#xD;
