    <textblock>
      Functional Neurological Disorder (FND/ Conversion Disorder) is a highly prevalent and&#xD;
      disabling neuropsychiatric condition. Motor FND symptoms include Functional Movement&#xD;
      Disorders (FMD) and Functional Weakness and Psychogenic Nonepileptic Seizures (PNES).Though&#xD;
      patients with FND present with a wide variety of symptoms, FMD, PNES, and functional weakness&#xD;
      may be viewed as overlapping conditions lying along a phenotypic spectrum for a single&#xD;
      disorder. Patients with FND frequently present with psychiatric symptoms, including&#xD;
      depression, anxiety, Borderline Personality Disorder, and Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder,&#xD;
      alongside their physical symptoms. To treat these symptoms, patients with FND are frequently&#xD;
      enrolled in physical therapy and cognitive behavioral therapy, which are considered usual&#xD;
      care for FND at our center. Developing a further understanding of treatment outcome,&#xD;
      including biomarkers of clinical improvement and psychometric factors associated with&#xD;
      treatment response, could inform future interventions and better tailor treatments to&#xD;
      patients with specific FND symptom profiles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We hypothesize that treatment response will be associated with structural and functional&#xD;
      alterations in salience network regions and that more adaptive neuropsychiatric profiles at&#xD;
      baseline will predict a positive treatment outcome.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Functional Neurological Disorder (FND) (Conversion Disorder) is a poorly understood and&#xD;
      prevalent somatoform disorder, making up 16% of outpatient neurology referrals. Patients with&#xD;
      motor FND (mFND) are difficult to treat, result in major morbidity, and are costly to the US.&#xD;
      An estimated $256 billion is spent annually treating this population. mFND includes&#xD;
      Functional Movement Disorders (FMD), Functional Weakness (FW) and Psychogenic Nonepileptic&#xD;
      Seizures (PNES).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This project will investigate brain network profiles associated with and predictive of&#xD;
      clinical improvement in patients with Functional Neurological Disorder (FND) following a&#xD;
      12-week cognitive behavioral therapy-informed physical therapy treatment program. Integrated&#xD;
      physical therapy along with self-guided cognitive behavioral therapy is usual care for&#xD;
      patients with FND experiencing motor symptoms at the Massachusetts General Hospital. Patients&#xD;
      with motor FND experience significant impairment and often face issues with treatment&#xD;
      management. Recent advancements in clinical research, catalyzed by new diagnostic criteria&#xD;
      and an updated care model, have emphasized physical therapy and cognitive behavioral therapy&#xD;
      as important evidence-based treatments for this population. Additionally, developments in&#xD;
      neuroscience have allowed for a more comprehensive understanding of the neurobiology of FND.&#xD;
      However, there has been limited investigation of longitudinal biomarkers associated with and&#xD;
      predictive of treatment response, highlighting the need for an improved understanding of&#xD;
      neurobiological changes underlying prognosis in FND.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We propose acquiring structural and functional brain imaging data in combination with&#xD;
      psychometric assessments and patient chart review to examine neurobiological mechanisms of&#xD;
      associated with participation in a cognitive behavioral therapy-informed physical therapy&#xD;
      treatment program for patients with FND.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Aim and Hypotheses The primary goal of this study is to provide structural and&#xD;
      functional biomarkers related to and predictive of treatment response and clinical outcome in&#xD;
      patients with motor FND following a 12-week cognitive behavioral therapy-informed physical&#xD;
      therapy treatment program (usual care).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 1:&#xD;
&#xD;
      SA1) Identify structural MRI biomarkers linked to and predictive of improvement following&#xD;
      cognitive behavioral therapy-informed physical therapy in FND.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypotheses: Improvement will correlate with increased volume, cortical thickness, and/or&#xD;
      white matter integrity in salience network-related regions post- versus pre- treatment.&#xD;
      Pre-treatment (baseline) salience network volume, cortical thickness, and/or white mater&#xD;
      integrity will predict clinical outcome of the 12-week treatment program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 2:&#xD;
&#xD;
      SA2) Identify resting-state functional MRI biomarkers linked to and predictive of improvement&#xD;
      following cognitive behavioral therapy-informed physical therapy in FND.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypotheses: Improvement will correlate with reduced post- versus pre- treatment&#xD;
      salience-somatomotor network resting state functional connectivity, and pre-treatment&#xD;
      salience-somatomotor network functional connectivity strength will predict clinical outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SA3) Identify baseline psychometric factors that correlate with clinical improvement (post&#xD;
      vs. pre-treatment), including differences among FND sub-populations and baseline predictors&#xD;
      of clinical improvement in FND.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypotheses: FND patients with more adaptive psychological profiles at baseline will be more&#xD;
      responsive to treatment.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  FND patients will be recruited from the FND clinic and allied neurology and psychiatry&#xD;
             clinics at Massachusetts General Hospital, with additional recruitment occurring&#xD;
             through the physical therapy department. This study aims to recruit a total of 70&#xD;
             patients with motor FND. FND subjects will meet established clinical diagnostic&#xD;
             criteria and patients with functional weakness will be diagnosed by &quot;positive&quot; signs&#xD;
             suggestive of functional weakness including but not limited to a positive Hoover's&#xD;
             sign. Individuals with PNES who have a concurrent functional limb weakness and/or a&#xD;
             functional movement disorder will also be recruited. In addition, all individuals will&#xD;
             have a clinical indication for PT (i.e. limb weakness, gait difficulties, abnormal&#xD;
             movements).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any significant major neurological disorder resulting in specific MRI abnormalities&#xD;
             (i.e. encephalomalacia, severe traumatic brain injury (TBI)), poorly controlled major&#xD;
             medical illness with known central nervous system consequences, inability to read&#xD;
             English, pregnancy, claustrophobia, or inability to satisfy MRI safety measures.&#xD;
             Additionally, patients with isolated PNES will not be considered for this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Note: individuals who are eligible for the study but have an MRI contraindication may be&#xD;
        offered study enrollment with MRI data collection for participation in aim 3 of this study.&#xD;
