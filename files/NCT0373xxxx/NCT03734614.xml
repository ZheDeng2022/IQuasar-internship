      The study evaluates the protective effect of low-dose aspirin use as adjuvant therapy on&#xD;
      locally advanced renal cell carcinoma in users and non-users of aspirin in Renji Hospital,&#xD;
      Shanghai, China.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) accounts for 2%~3% of all malignant tumors worldwide. In China,&#xD;
      the incidence of renal cancer is increasing year by year. It is reported about one-third of&#xD;
      patients were at late stage when diagnosed while about one-third of patients who received&#xD;
      surgical treatment would eventually lead to recurrence or metastasis. The 5-years survival is&#xD;
      only about 50% in patients with locally advanced RCC, which lacks of effective adjuvant&#xD;
      treatments, although the S-TRAC study showed improved Disease-free Survival (DFS) in&#xD;
      high-risk renal cell carcinoma after nephrectomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aspirin, also called acetylsalicylic acid, belongs to non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs&#xD;
      (NSAIDs). Its inhibitory effect on platelet aggregation makes it widely used in&#xD;
      cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases. In addition, a number of epidemiology, basic and&#xD;
      clinical researches confirmed that aspirin may be the most promising chemopreventive agent to&#xD;
      date, especially against CRC. Prospective studies have also shown that aspirin can improve&#xD;
      survival of patients with breast cancer,colorectal cancer, gastro-esophageal cancer and&#xD;
      prostate cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the investigator's clinical practice, we'd like to investigate the preventive effects of&#xD;
      low-dose aspirin use as an adjuvant therapy after radical nephrectomy on disease&#xD;
      recurrence/metastasis and survival in patients with locally advanced renal cell carcinoma in&#xD;
      Renji Hospital affiliated to Shanghai Jiao Tong University school of medicine. The study is&#xD;
      observational and prospective, patients with locally advanced RCC will decide whether or not&#xD;
      to take low-dose Aspirin(100mg/d) after radical nephrectomy as adjuvant therapy for 1 year.&#xD;
      The primary end point was the duration of disease-free survival, and the secondary end points&#xD;
      included overall survival and safety.&#xD;
