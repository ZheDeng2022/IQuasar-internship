  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is Phase 1b/2a, open label, multi-center study to assess safety, tolerability,&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics and anti-tumor activity of vactosertib in combination with durvalumab in&#xD;
      patients advanced NSCLC. This study has been designed to allow for an investigation of the&#xD;
      optimal dose of vactosertib in combination with durvalumab. There are two parts to this&#xD;
      study: Phase 1b, vactosertib dose-escalation study to determine the recommended phase 2 dose&#xD;
      (RP2D) and Phase 2a, non-randomized parallel dose expansion study to confirm RP2D.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the current dose-escalation (Phase 1b) study to determine RP2D, vactosertib dosing will&#xD;
      begin at 100 mg BID for 5 days per week in combination with durvalumab 1500 mg, Q4W.&#xD;
      According to the following dose escalation rule, 200 mg BID oral dose as maximum administered&#xD;
      dose (MAD) will be administered in combination with durvalumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This phase 2a study is a study designed to evaluate the anti-tumor effects of vactosertib in&#xD;
      combination with durvalumab in a total of 45 patients with PD-L1 positive advanced NSCLC who&#xD;
      progressed following platinum-based chemotherapy (no prior immunotherapy)&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Capable of giving signed informed consent which includes compliance with the&#xD;
             requirements and restrictions listed in the informed consent form (ICF) and in this&#xD;
             protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Age ≥19 years at the time of screening&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status (PS) of 0 or 1 at&#xD;
             enrollment&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Histological or cytological confirmation of advanced NSCLC who progressed following&#xD;
             platinum-based chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. If there is measurable disease based on RECIST 1.1 identified by the investigator at&#xD;
             screening and there is at least one non-irradiated lesion suitable for selection as a&#xD;
             target lesion according to RECIST 1.1 on imaging test, tumor assessment by computed&#xD;
             tomography (CT) scan or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) must be performed within 28&#xD;
             days prior to the first dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. No prior exposure to immune-mediated therapy including, but not limited to, other anti&#xD;
             CTLA-4, anti-PD-1, anti-PD-L1, and anti programmed cell death ligand 2 (anti-PD-L2)&#xD;
             antibodies, excluding therapeutic anticancer vaccines for treatment purpose.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. In dose escalation phase, 6 DLT evaluable patients whose tumor cell PD-L1 expression&#xD;
             less than 25% will be enrolled in each cohort. In dose expansion phase, 45 patients&#xD;
             with confirmed PD-L1-positive NSCLC by using the Ventana SP263 IHC assay will be&#xD;
             enrolled&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Evaluation in newly acquired tumor tissue (preferred) or archival tissue (≤3&#xD;
                  years old).&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  If the patient's PD-L1 status has already been assessed using Ventana SP263&#xD;
                  assay, this test result can be used to assess eligibility for enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Note: A positive PD-L1 sample is measured using a defined cut-off based on ≥1% of&#xD;
                  tumor cells with membrane staining of any intensity for PD-L1.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. All patients must be able to provide an available tumor sample collected within ≤3&#xD;
             years after the last anticancer therapies prior to screening. At least 25 patients&#xD;
             enrolled in the dose expansion phase must be able to provide newly acquired tumor&#xD;
             biopsy taken within 6 months prior to the first dosing. Tumor lesions used for newly&#xD;
             acquired biopsies should not be target lesions, unless there are no other lesions&#xD;
             suitable for biopsy, and only a core needle (not excisional/incisional) biopsy is&#xD;
             allowed when biopsies are performed on target lesions as there is no other lesions&#xD;
             suitable for biopsy. In patients with only one target lesion, biopsy for baseline&#xD;
             tumor evaluation should be performed prior to the imaging test with an interval of at&#xD;
             least 2 weeks after biopsy. Samples with limited tumor content and fine needle&#xD;
             aspirate specimens are not acceptable. Specimens from metastatic bone lesions are&#xD;
             typically unacceptable unless there is a significant soft tissue component. The tumor&#xD;
             specimen quantity should be as sufficient as possible to allow for exploratory&#xD;
             biomarker analyses and is preferred in formalin-fixed paraffin embedded blocks. An&#xD;
             additional subsequent tumour biopsy will be performed on C2D3~6 or C2D10~13 only in&#xD;
             patients who provide newly acquired tumor biopsy taken within 6 months prior to the&#xD;
             first dosing. The same tumor lesion should be biopsied at all timepoints, if feasible,&#xD;
             to avoid introduction of heterogeneity related to the site of tumor or metastasis.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Adequate organ and marrow function as defined below:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Hemoglobin ≥9.0 g/dL&#xD;

&#xD;
               -  Serum bilirubin ≤1.5 × the upper limit of normal (ULN). This will not apply to&#xD;
                  patients with confirmed Gilbert's syndrome, who will be allowed enrollment in&#xD;
                  consultation with their physician.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  ALT and AST ≤2.5 × ULN; for patients with hepatic metastases, ALT and AST ≤5 ×&#xD;
                  ULN&#xD;

             psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study&#xD;
             requirement, substantially increase risk of incurring AEs or compromise the ability of&#xD;
             the patient to give written informed consent&#xD;

             with a past or resolved HBV infection (defined as the presence of hepatitis B core&#xD;
             antibody (anti-HBc) and negative of HBsAg) are eligible. Patients positive for&#xD;
             hepatitis C (HCV) antibody are eligible only with negative HCV RNA measured by&#xD;
             polymerase chain reaction.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Any unresolved toxicity NCI CTCAE Grade ≥2 from previous anticancer therapy with the&#xD;

             RECIST Target Lesions at baseline. Note: Patients whose brain metastases have been&#xD;
             treated may participate provided they show radiographic stability defined as 2 brain&#xD;
             imaging results, both of which are obtained after treatment to the brain metastases.&#xD;
             These imaging scans should both be obtained at least 4 weeks apart and show no&#xD;
             evidence of intracranial progression. In addition, any neurologic symptoms that&#xD;
             developed either as a result of the brain metastases or their treatment must have&#xD;

             time has not occurred due to the medication administration schedule or PK properties&#xD;
             of an agent, a longer wash-out period will be required, as agreed by Sponsor and the&#xD;
             Investigator. Concurrent use of following therapies is acceptable.&#xD;
