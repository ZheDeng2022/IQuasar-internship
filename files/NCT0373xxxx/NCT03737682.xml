      Assessment of pulp inflammation by hemostasis achievement after pulp exposure&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The possibility has been raised of diagnosing pulpal pathological status using the cytokines&#xD;
      that are released during the inflammation process in healthy as well as infected tooth pulp.&#xD;
      Cytokines are small polypeptides secreted by leucocytes and other inflammatory cells and are&#xD;
      known to play important roles in the intensity and duration of the immune response&#xD;
