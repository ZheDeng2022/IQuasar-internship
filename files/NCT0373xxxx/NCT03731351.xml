  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Stroke remains the leading cause of disability in the United States. An estimated 40-50% of&#xD;
      all ischemic strokes are caused by large-vessel occlusion of a major cerebral artery (LVO).&#xD;
      However, in some cases, the occlusion results in mild symptoms, at least initially, and these&#xD;
      patients frequently do not receive any treatment. These strokes, however, may result in&#xD;
      unfavorable long-term outcomes despite relatively benign initial course. Recent large&#xD;
      randomized studies in patients with severe stroke symptoms and associated LVO showed efficacy&#xD;
      and safety of endovascular mechanical thrombectomy, but patients with mild symptoms were not&#xD;
      specifically addressed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on the investigators' own data and limited evidence in the literature, the&#xD;
      investigators propose that early mechanical thrombectomy in patients with LVO associated with&#xD;
      mild stroke symptoms (defined as NIHSS ≤ 5) is safe, and results in favorable long-term&#xD;
      patient outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this prospective pilot study is to assess the safety and outcomes of&#xD;
      mechanical thrombectomy in patients presenting with acute ischemic stroke due to a large&#xD;
      vessel occlusion in the anterior or posterior circulation under 24 hours with mild symptoms&#xD;
      (NIHSS ≤ 5).&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Patients who present with mild stroke symptoms (mAIS), and are also found to have an&#xD;
      intracranial large vessel occlusion (LVO) pose an exceptionally difficult therapeutic&#xD;
      dilemma. The need for any acute treatment is often debated since these patients &quot;only&quot; have&#xD;
      mild deficits, and any therapy has associated risks. However, it has been shown that acute&#xD;
      ischemic stroke (AIS) can lead to considerable morbidity and mortality even in patients&#xD;
      presenting with mild symptoms (mAIS) in the presence of LVO. Despite reports that such&#xD;
      patients have less favorable outcomes, these patients are often excluded from acute stroke&#xD;
      therapy. Recent studies demonstrated that, despite mild and rapidly improving symptoms, many&#xD;
      patients end up with unfavorable outcome. While the most recent AHA/ASA guidelines no longer&#xD;
      recommend excluding patients with milder improving symptoms from intravenous tissue&#xD;
      plasminogen activator administration, the role of endovascular intervention has not been&#xD;
      clarified for these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior data has shown high morbidity and mortality in mAIS patients (without specified large&#xD;
      vessel status), who did not receive IV tPA, demonstrating that as high as 32% of patients was&#xD;
      dependent during discharge or died in one study. A common reason for foregoing treatment in&#xD;
      this patient group was that mild symptoms or rapid improvement were a contraindication to&#xD;
      IV-tPA administration according to previous ASA/AHA guidelines. Higher morbidity was&#xD;
      specifically noted in patients with concurrent large vessel occlusion as a cause of the&#xD;
      symptom in another study. Mokin et al showed that for LVO patients excluded from&#xD;
      thrombolysis, only 2/3rd could walk independently at discharge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When assessing predictors of poor outcome, LVO seems to correlate with poor outcome despite&#xD;
      mild symptoms. Nedeltchev et al published a study with 162 patients with either mild stroke&#xD;
      symptoms (NIHSS of 3 or less) or rapidly improving symptoms (NIHSS improvement of 4 points or&#xD;
      more), in which 25% of the patients had an unfavorable outcome. NIHSS of 10 or more and&#xD;
      proximal vessel occlusion were independent predictors of poor outcome. LVO in patients with&#xD;
      rapidly improving /mild symptoms conferred an 18-fold increased risk of early neurological&#xD;
      deficit with infarct expansion. Patients with LVO were also more likely to have increased&#xD;
      modified ranking scale (mRS), and LVO was an independent predictor of decline in functional&#xD;
      status and a borderline significant predictor of poor outcome when adjusting for age, gender&#xD;
      and presenting NIHSS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      NIH Stroke Scale Score Threshold The ideal NIHSS cutoff value for &quot;mild&quot; stroke remains&#xD;
      unclear, and varies across studies. The investigators specifically chose the NIHSS 5 cut-off&#xD;
      value for the cohort after careful consideration of the results of several earlier reports,&#xD;
      which were available at the initiation of our research project. These studies, albeit with&#xD;
      limited sensitivity and specificity, have concluded that an NIHSS cut-off of 7-10 and higher&#xD;
      might be a reliable predictor of LVO. Since the investigators were trying to capture a&#xD;
      controversial stroke population that was unlikely to have LVO because of mild symptoms, the&#xD;
      investigators decided to include patients with NIHSS 5 or less.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently approved treatment and limitations At present, the American Heart Association and&#xD;
      American Stroke Association guidelines recommend that eligible ischemic strokes be treated&#xD;
      with IV tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) and/or mechanical thrombectomy. Severity of the&#xD;
      stroke is based on the National institute of health stroke scale (NIHSS), and the guidelines&#xD;
      do not specify any thrombolysis treatment for mild strokes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mechanical thrombectomy using stent retrievers for LVO stroke has become the standard of&#xD;
      care; however, current guidelines exclude patients with mild or improving symptoms. These&#xD;
      recommendations were made based on the 2015 randomized control trials, most of which did not&#xD;
      include patients with NIHSS &lt;6.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite the MR-CLEAN trial's inclusion of patients with NIHSS as low as 2, which showed&#xD;
      efficacy of IAT for LVO, it is unclear what proportion of successfully treated patients were&#xD;
      actually in the mAIS category. The PRISMS study investigated the efficacy IV-tPA in mAIS&#xD;
      patients, although establishment of large vessel status was not specifically required&#xD;
      (NCT02072226). The TEMPO -1 trial showed safety and feasibility of tenecteplase in patients&#xD;
      with LVO and mAIS, and the TEMPO - 2 trial (NCT02398656) comparing tenecteplase to standard&#xD;
      therapy is currently ongoing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The recently completed DAWN trial is an international multi-center randomized trial study of&#xD;
      patients with acute ischemic anterior stroke due to large vessel occlusions between 6 -24&#xD;
      hours of stroke with endovascular therapy. The results from 206 patients enrolled in the&#xD;
      trial demonstrated treatment with use of stentriver significantly decreased post-stroke&#xD;
      disability and improved functional independence at 90 days when compared to medical&#xD;
      management alone (48.6% vs 13.1%, p&lt;0.001), a relative reduction in disability of 73%&#xD;
      percent. The study showed that one in 2.8 patients treated with the stentriever within 24&#xD;
      hours of a stroke is saved from severe disability. Another large trial, the Diffusion and&#xD;
      Perfusion Imaging Evaluation for Understanding Stroke Evolution 3 (DEFUSE 3), was halted&#xD;
      after the DAWN trial results were presented. This study enrolled patients with large vessel&#xD;
      occlusion presenting within 6 and 16 hours of stroke onset based on advanced imaging&#xD;
      criteria. Patients who underwent endovascular therapy had 2.77 times greater odds of&#xD;
      regaining functional independence at 90 days, versus medical management alone (45% vs 17%,&#xD;
      p&lt;0.001), showing benefit for the endovascular group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Acute vertebrobasilar occlusion The efficacy of mechanical thrombectomy in the anterior&#xD;
      circulation raised the question of its potential applicability in the posterior circulation.&#xD;
      Acute basilar occlusion accounts for approximately 1% of all acute ischemic strokes, and is&#xD;
      disproportionately associated with a mortality rate of approximately 70%. Given these&#xD;
      statistics, procedural risks in acute basilar occlusion syndromes have long been regarded&#xD;
      much lower than the risk of unfavorable outcome without intervention. Therefore these&#xD;
      patients have largely been omitted from clinical trials resulting in a paucity of clinical&#xD;
      evidence, in contrast with anterior circulation strokes. Patients with mild-to-moderate&#xD;
      posterior circulation AIS pose a unique challenge, as retrospective data correlate the&#xD;
      patients' clinical outcome with severity at presentation, giving them up to 67% chance of&#xD;
      achieving a favorable outcome.&#xD;
