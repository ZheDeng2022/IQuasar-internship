  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The decision for red cell transfusion is usually made empirically by clinicians. We aim to&#xD;
      perform a two-year retrospective audit of obstetric red cell transfusions at a tertairy&#xD;
      women's hospital to evaluate the (1) incidence of obstetric red cell transfusion, (2)&#xD;
      indications for transfusion and (3) haemoglobin triggers and targets of transfusion.&#xD;
      Obstetric patients who were given red cell or whole blood transfusion during their pregnancy&#xD;
      and who delivered a live or still birth between 1 Jan 2014 to 31 Dec 2015 are included in the&#xD;
      analysis. Findings of this study would provide insights into transfusion practice and&#xD;
      appropriateness of obstetric red cell transfusion at a tertiary obstetric hospital in&#xD;
      Singapore.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Studies suggest an inter-hospital variation in transfusion rates, despite the availability of&#xD;
      transfusion guidelines. As part of an initiative to implement patient blood management at our&#xD;
      institution, we conducted this retrospective cohort study with the aims of defining the&#xD;
      incidence of red cell transfusion among our multiethnic obstetric population and evaluating&#xD;
      transfusion practice, with regard to indications and appropriateness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethics approval has been obtained from the institutional review board. Patients who fulfil&#xD;
      study criteria would be identified from the hospital's delivery and blood bank registries.&#xD;
      Further information would be extracted from the medical records and blood bank database. The&#xD;
      delivery registry would also be accessed to obtain the total number of parturients who&#xD;
      delivered for the study period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following data would be collected and a pro-forma completed:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Demographic data: age, body mass index, gravidity, parity&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Obstetric data: gestation age at pregnancy booking, occurrence of obstetric conditions&#xD;
           associated with bleeding, mode of delivery, estimated blood loss at delivery and&#xD;
           antenatal prescription of iron therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Transfusion data: indications for red cell transfusion, number of transfusion events,&#xD;
           haemoglobin (Hb) levels at different time points of pregnancy, location of transfusion,&#xD;
           adverse events associated with transfusion, activation of massive transfusion protocol&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the purpose of the study, a &quot;transfusion event&quot; is defined as the time interval between&#xD;
      prescription of red cells and complete administration to patient. If multiple units were&#xD;
      prescribed, all units are considered part of the single event if the time of prescription&#xD;
      between consecutive units does not exceed 72 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The incidence of transfusion would be defined as the percentage of patients ('cases')&#xD;
      requiring red cell transfusion antenatally and up to 6 weeks postnatally among ALL patients&#xD;
      who delivered a live or still birth in the period 2014-2015.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis would be performed using SPSS for windows, version 19 (IBM, Armonk, NY).&#xD;
      Data would be presented as mean (+/- SD), median (IQR) or count (%), as appropriate. Missing&#xD;
      data would be excluded from the analysis.&#xD;
