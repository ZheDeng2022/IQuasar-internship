  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall goal of this project is to demonstrate the feasibility, implementation, and&#xD;
      preliminary efficacy of a technology-assisted stepped care (TASC) adherence-promotion&#xD;
      intervention in adolescents with asthma. Preliminary efficacy will be demonstrated by&#xD;
      improved adherence to daily inhaled corticosteroids as measured by Propeller Health&#xD;
      electronic monitoring devices. The TASC intervention will result in improved disease severity&#xD;
      measured by the Composite Asthma Severity Index (combining dose of asthma medication&#xD;
      required, asthma symptom burden, and frequency of exacerbations and health care utilization)&#xD;
      and lung function as measured by mobile spirometry. The TASC adherence-promotion intervention&#xD;
      implementation will be successful as evidenced by high levels of feasibility (e.g.,&#xD;
      attendance), acceptability (20 item Acceptability Questionnaire), and usability (10 item&#xD;
      Usability Scale).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Up to thirty adolescents with asthma will be enrolled in an open label pilot trial of the&#xD;
      TASC adherence-promotion intervention for a duration of five months. First, participants will&#xD;
      complete baseline questionnaires related to demographic, and clinical predictors of adherence&#xD;
      and asthma and a 4 week run-in phase to assess baseline adherence using electronic inhaler&#xD;
      monitoring with a cellphone that is provided to them. Following the run-in period, all&#xD;
      participants will receive Step 1 of the TASC intervention for a minimum of 4 weeks. Step 1&#xD;
      (Information) will include electronic educational information related to asthma symptoms and&#xD;
      triggers, attacks, self-monitoring, treatments, action plans, and automated text message&#xD;
      medication reminders. Following the initial four weeks of Step 1, adherence will be evaluated&#xD;
      and a rate of less than 68% will serve as the cause for &quot;stepping up&quot; to the next level of&#xD;
      the intervention. Adherence checks will continue to occur every four weeks for the duration&#xD;
      of the study and adherence &lt;68% will prompt movement from one level of treatment to the next.&#xD;
      Participants may remain at a treatment level for more than four weeks and may complete 1, 2,&#xD;
      or 3 interventions steps during the 5 month study depending on the adolescent's adherence.&#xD;
      Step 2 (Motivation) will include electronic monitoring of adherence and personally tailored&#xD;
      feedback via text messages. Adolescents will be given access to the adherence tracking&#xD;
      smartphone app and graphs of their inhaler adherence. Adolescents will also receive brief,&#xD;
      personalized text messages that provide supportive motivation and directive, tangible&#xD;
      actions. Step 3 (Behavioral) will include problem-solving telehealth intervention with a&#xD;
      trained clinician. Four telehealth sessions individually tailored to the unique needs and&#xD;
      barriers of the adolescent will be provided. The primary outcome measure will be&#xD;
      electronically-monitored adherence assessed at post-treatment. Secondary outcomes include&#xD;
      asthma severity as well as process evaluation questions and quantitative measures of&#xD;
      feasibility, acceptability, and satisfaction to demonstrate implementation.&#xD;

    <measure>Electronic Monitoring</measure>
    <time_frame>5 Months</time_frame>
    <description>The Propeller Health monitoring system includes a Bluetooth enabled sensor that attaches to the patient's inhaler. This sensor records every dose, or &quot;puff&quot;, the patient takes and sends it to a corresponding online database that is accessible to study staff. Participants will be given this sensor at baseline.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Composite Asthma Severity Index (CASI)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline assessment and then once a month for 5 months</time_frame>
    <description>The participants' composite asthma severity index score will be calculated through the TreatSmart program. TreatSmart will be used to determine the participant's symptom burden, health care utilization, systemic corticosteroid use, and current medication use to determine the level of asthma severity/control the participant has. The program also makes an initial treatment recommendation based on the National Asthma Education and Prevention Program (NAEPP asthma guidelines). Individuals are placed in Step 1 through Step 6 depending on the strength and frequency of their inhaled corticosteroid (1 being low dose and 6 being a high dose). In addition, individuals are categorized as very poorly controlled, not well controlled, or well controlled based on how frequently they have had asthma symptoms or used their rescue inhaler, gone to the hospital or urgent care, or received steroids for asthma symptoms.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Asthma Control Test (ACT)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline assessment and then once a month for 5 months</time_frame>
    <description>The ACT will be used as a measure of disease severity in this study. The ACT is a 5-question scoring tool designed for patients with asthma who are 12 years and older. The questions ask the patient to rate their asthma severity, symptom frequency, control, and inhaler use on a scale of 1-5. The total score is calculated by the sum of each response, which determines how well-controlled the patient's asthma is on a scale from 5-25.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Attendance/Participation rates</measure>
    <time_frame>5 months</time_frame>
    <description>Participation rates will be measured 3 different ways. The first measure will be how often participants accessed the electronic material (educational materials and/or Propeller Health app), the second measure will be how many responses to directive text messaging were received, and the third measure will be attendance to the telehealth sessions.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Feasibility/Acceptability Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>5 months</time_frame>
    <description>A 5-31 item measure of format, content, length, skills and acceptability of the intervention will be given to participants in the form of a questionnaire at the end of each step and the end of the study. The feasibility section is on a scale of 0 to 4, 0 being the worst and 4 being the best. The acceptability questionnaire is on a scale from 'Not at all' to 'Very,' 'Not at all' being the worst and 'Very' being the best.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>System Usability Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>5 months</time_frame>
    <description>A 10 item, Likert scale giving a global view of usability will be given to participants in the form of a questionnaire at the end of each step and at the end of the study. The scale ranges from 'Strongly Disagree' to 'Strongly Agree, with half of the items reverse scored.</description>
