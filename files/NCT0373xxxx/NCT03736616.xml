      To evaluate the tolerability,feasibility, and efficacy of combining acalabrutinib with RICE&#xD;
      chemotherapy as second line therapy in relapsed/refractory DLBCL patients with separate&#xD;
      primary objectives in each of in two cohorts:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cohort A: Hematopoeitic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) eligible patients undergoing&#xD;
      second-line salvage chemoimmunotherapy [Rituximab, Ifosfamide, Carboplatin, and Etoposide&#xD;
      (RICE)] plus acalabrutinib:.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cohort B: Individuals not eligible for HSCT undergoing second-line salvage chemoimmunotherapy&#xD;
      [Rituximab, Ifosfamide, Carboplatin, and Etoposide (RICE)] plus acalabrutinib followed by&#xD;
      acalabrutinib as a maintenance therapy&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase II study with a safety run-in. There will be two planned cohorts, Cohort A&#xD;
      and Cohort B. Cohort A will be open to R/R DLBCL patients who are medically eligible for&#xD;
      autologous HSCT (autoHSCT). Cohort B will be open to R/R DLBCL patients who are medically&#xD;
      ineligible for autologous transplant. Historical outcomes from completed, published&#xD;
      prospective clinical trials using RICE salvage chemotherapy will serve as a comparator&#xD;
      population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety run-in: To assess for safety of the combination of acalabrutinib and RICE&#xD;
      chemotherapy, we will pause enrollment in both cohorts to assess for any safety concerns once&#xD;
      a total 10 patients have been enrolled to either cohort. After the first ten patients have&#xD;
      all completed at least one cycle of therapy without unacceptable or unexpected concerns,&#xD;
      enrollment will resume. If there are concerns about adverse events or the ability of patients&#xD;
      to proceed as expected to HSCT, then the study team will convene to determine whether the&#xD;
      protocol should be modified. Data obtained for the first ten patients will be included in the&#xD;
      data sample for final analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cohort A: After confirmation of medical eligibility for autologous HSCT, patients enrolled in&#xD;
      Cohort A will receive 2 cycles of standard dose RICE salvage chemotherapy in combination with&#xD;
      acalabrutinib 100mg twice daily (BID) day 1-21 of a 21 day cycle. After 2 cycles of therapy,&#xD;
      patients will undergo autologous cell collection per standard institutional procedures.&#xD;
      Acalabrutinib will be held 3 days before planned placement of an apheresis collection&#xD;
      catheter and resumed 3 days after completion of stem cell collection and catheter removal.&#xD;
      Patients will then receive a 3rd cycle of RICE chemotherapy in combination with acalabrutinib&#xD;
      100mg BID. For patients with bone marrow disease at enrollment, a repeat bone marrow will be&#xD;
      performed after 2 cycles of salvage therapy, prior to autologous stem cell collection. For&#xD;
      patients with continued bone marrow disease after 2 cycles of salvage therapy, a 3rd cycle&#xD;
      may be given prior to autologous cell collection. PET-CT (PET3) will be performed 14-21 days&#xD;
      after day 1 of cycle 3 to assess response. Those patients with complete response (CR) or&#xD;
      partial response (PR) after PET3 will move onto autologous transplant with Carmustine,&#xD;
      Etoposide, Cytarabine, and Melphalan (BEAM) conditioning within 28-42 days of PET3. After&#xD;
      adequate hematopoietic recovery (expected around 30 days after autologous HSCT), patients&#xD;
      will restart acalabrutinib 100mg BID as maintenance therapy for a period of 12 months.&#xD;
      Patients with a minor response (MR) or stable disease (SD) after PET3 will delay HSCT and&#xD;
      will continue acalabrutinib 100mg BID with repeat PET every 6 weeks. If patient converts to&#xD;
      CR at subsequent PET-CT, they may proceed with BEAM autologous HSCT within 28-42 days of&#xD;
      achieving this response followed by 12 months of post-transplant acalabrutinib maintenance.&#xD;
      Patients with continued PR/MR/SD may continue on study, if felt to be clinically benefitting&#xD;
      without limiting toxicity, but will not receive a transplant. Patients demonstrating&#xD;
      progressive disease (PD) at any stage will be withdrawn from study treatment but their&#xD;
      outcomes will be tracked and included in final data analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cohort B: Patients medically ineligible for autologous HSCT but fit for salvage chemotherapy&#xD;
      will receive 3 cycles or RICE salvage chemotherapy in combination with acalabrutinib 100mg&#xD;
      BID day 1-21 of a 21 day cycle followed by PET-CT (PET3) 14-21 days after start of Cycle 3.&#xD;
      Patients with CR/PR/MR/SD would continue with acalabrutinib maintenance with repeat PET-CT&#xD;
      every 3 months until disease progression or toxicity. Patients demonstrating progressive&#xD;
      disease (PD) will be withdrawn from study treatment but their outcomes will be tracked and&#xD;
      included in final data analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Establishing the feasibility of combining acalabrutinib with RICE chemotherapy in transplant&#xD;
      eligible and transplant ineligible patients with R/R DLBCL will provide the foundation for a&#xD;
      larger study of efficacy and long-term outcomes of the combination therapy for patients with&#xD;
      R/R DLBCL. Such a study, if demonstrative of improvements in the complete response rate to&#xD;
      salvage therapy at PET3, could provide evidence to support a new standard of care of for&#xD;
      patients with R/R DLBCL.&#xD;
