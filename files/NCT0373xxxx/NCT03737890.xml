    <textblock>
      Frailty is a clinical syndrome that alters the structure and function of respiratory system&#xD;
      which causes stiffness of thoracic cage and reduces the chest wall compliance in addition of&#xD;
      respiratory muscle weakness that can lead to the reduction of pulmonary function. The aim of&#xD;
      this study was to compare the effect of inspiratory muscle training (IMT) and hold-relax&#xD;
      pectoral stretch on pulmonary function (FVC, FEV1 and FEV1/FVC) among frail elderly&#xD;

      Aging leads to the biological and physiological changes in the human body but it is more&#xD;
      pronounced in frail elderly. One of the body systems which will undergo changes due to aging&#xD;
      is the respiratory system. Respiratory system changes can be in terms of mechanics, muscular&#xD;
      and immunological aspects. These changes often lead to respiratory impairment or more often&#xD;
      defined as spirometrically airflow limitation or restrictive- pattern. Aging will change the&#xD;
      structure of thoracic cage, causing a reduction in chest wall compliance. Moreover, aging&#xD;
      disease such as osteoporosis also causes stiffening of the thoracic cage and kyphosis. As a&#xD;
      result, the ribcage is unable to expand and contract, causing difficulty in breathing. In&#xD;
      addition, atrophy of skeletal muscles leads to increased loss of lean tissue. With the loss&#xD;
      of lean tissue in the respiratory muscles, the pulmonary function of an elderly will&#xD;
      subsequently be compromised. All these changes decrease the volume of the thoracic cavity and&#xD;
      reduce lung volumes which leads to limitation of air flow, decrease of FEV1, FVC and FEV1/FVC&#xD;
      as well as increase in residual volume and functional residual capacity. As a result, elderly&#xD;
      will tend to have increased work of breathing compared to younger individuals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Other than that, immunological changes that occur in the elderly increases their risk of&#xD;
      getting respiratory tract infection, leading to development of pulmonary disease such as&#xD;
      pneumonia. In addition, elderly have higher exposure to second-hand smoke, toxin exposure&#xD;
      from the environment which can predispose them to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease&#xD;
      leading to dyspnea and alter the pulmonary function. All these changes can have a strong&#xD;
      impact on morbidity, mortality and quality of life in elderly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As a person ages, observable changes can be seen in body composition and body phenotype.&#xD;
      These changes will alter the structure and function of the respiratory system. Prevention and&#xD;
      intervention programs are necessary to minimize the loss of respiratory function in order to&#xD;
      reverse the progression of frailty condition. Exercises such as inspiratory muscle training&#xD;
      (IMT) and hold relax pectoral stretch has been found to be helpful in strengthening the&#xD;
      breathing muscles and improving pulmonary function respectively. Studies have shown that&#xD;
      these two exercises will help in increasing the pulmonary function but till date there is no&#xD;
      study which has been carried out to find the effectiveness of these 2 exercises on pulmonary&#xD;
      function in frail elderly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 34 residents from Seavoy Nursing Home were recruited after screening (excluded;&#xD;
      bed ridden participants, not able to communicate and give their consent, suffering from a&#xD;
      ruptured eardrum or any other condition of the ear, abnormally low perception of dyspnea,&#xD;
      presence of cardiac pacemaker, unable to do overhead movement and hyper-mobility of&#xD;
      shoulder). Based on the inclusion criteria, the participants needed to be above 60 years of&#xD;
      age, currently residing in a care facility, a citizen of Malaysia, ability to understand&#xD;
      Malay, English, Mandarin and Cantonese and able to score more than 16 out of 30 in Montreal&#xD;
      Cognitive assessment (MoCA). Score of 16 and above on MoCA was to make sure participants were&#xD;
      able to follow and understand the instructions given during testing and intervention. This&#xD;
      was followed by assessment for frail criteria. At least 3 of the frail criteria; shrinking,&#xD;
      weakness, poor endurance, slowness of gait, and low physical activity level needed to be met&#xD;
      by participants. Questions such as body weight, height, losing weight, their daily physical&#xD;
      activity, their endurance and power status by self reported exhaustion were asked. For&#xD;
      shrinking, body weight and height were measured and compared to nursing homes past 1 year&#xD;
      record. Participants with unintentional weight loss of 4.5Kgs or more from past 1 year were&#xD;
      considered for this study. Weakness criterion was evaluated by checking the grip strength of&#xD;
      the dominant hand with cut-off point for different BMI. Besides that, the poor endurance&#xD;
      criterion was assessed using two statements of the CES-D scale: &quot;I felt that everything I did&#xD;
      was an effort&quot; and &quot;I could not get going&quot; for much or most of the time, when asked. A low&#xD;
      physical activity criterion was met if male scored less than 64 and female less than 52 on&#xD;
      Physical Activity Scale for the Elderly (PASE). Besides the slow gait speed criterion was met&#xD;
      if the participant took more than 10 seconds to walk back and forth over a ten-foot.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After meeting all the inclusion criteria, participants were randomly divided into either into&#xD;
      experimental group who did inspiratory muscle training or control group who did hold-relax&#xD;
      pectoral stretch. Pulmonary function (FVC, FEV1, FEV1/FVC) were measured by spirometer in&#xD;
      sitting upright position. A nose clip was used and participants were instructed to tightly&#xD;
      securing the lips around the mouth piece of spirometer. A single trail was run to make sure&#xD;
      participants know how to use the spiromter before actual test was conducted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For screening purpose, Montreal Cognitive assessment (MoCA) was used to evaluate the&#xD;
      cognitive status. Physical Activity Scale for the Elderly (PASE) was used to evaluate the&#xD;
      physical activity level of the elderly. Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale&#xD;
      (CES- D) was used to evaluate the poor endurance and energy of the elderly. Dynamometer&#xD;
      (Jamar hydraulic hand dynamometer) was used to measure the grip strength of the elderly to&#xD;
      evaluate the weakness. Furthermore, Portable spirometer (MIR Spirobank II Â®) was used to&#xD;
      measure the outcome measures (FVC, FEV1, FEV1/FVC). Last but not least, IMT device&#xD;
      (Respironics Threshold IMT) was used for inspiratory muscle training.&#xD;
&#xD;
      34 participants were assigned into two groups; control group and experimental group. Each&#xD;
      participant was supposed to complete a total of 12 sessions of exercises, 3 sessions per week&#xD;
      for 4 weeks. In control group, the participants received 3 sets of passive hold- relax&#xD;
      pectoral stretch for each session. Each stretch was maintained for 10 seconds with a rest&#xD;
      period of 30 seconds given between the sets. Participants were in sitting position, shoulders&#xD;
      held in abducted position with elbows flexed and both hand joined behind the neck. The&#xD;
      subjects were asked to contract the agonist muscles and hold for 10 seconds while resistance&#xD;
      was applied to the contraction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the other hand, participants in the experimental group were given Inspiratory Muscle&#xD;
      Training by using an IMT device (Respironics Threshold IMT). Participants were in Fowler's&#xD;
      position. Based on the protocol of Inspiratory Muscle Training, a nose clip was used during&#xD;
      the training. Participants were advised to inform the researchers and stop the exercise&#xD;
      immediately if they felt dizziness or breathlessness. Before the training, participants were&#xD;
      taught how to use the device and were instructed to use the correct breathing technique while&#xD;
      using the device. For this training, the inspiratory load for each participant was set at 30&#xD;
      cmH2O. During the protocol, researchers observed the participants for their facial expression&#xD;
      to ensure that they do not breath forcefully to exhaust themselves. Verbal cue such as don't&#xD;
      lift up the chest when doing the breathing exercise, use diaphragm to perform the exercise&#xD;
      were given. Participants performed three sets of ten breaths with resting period of one&#xD;
      minute between the sets.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome measure in this study was pulmonary function. The measures of pulmonary&#xD;
      function were: Forced vital capacity (FVC), forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1),&#xD;
      FEV1/FVC. These were assessed by spirometry and expressed in litres. The measures were&#xD;
      assessed with the participants in sitting position with the use of nose clip. A clear&#xD;
      instruction was given to the participants to expire forcefully out into the disposable&#xD;
      mouthpiece and after the machine provide a sound, the participants were asked to inspire&#xD;
      forcefully from the disposable mouthpiece. A trail run was performed before running the&#xD;
      actual test. The measurement of FVC, FEV1 and FEV1/FVC was evaluated before and after the&#xD;
      intervention. Data was recorded in the data collection sheet. However, during this study&#xD;
      there were 2 dropouts from experimental group who refused to continue the exercise after&#xD;
      first week of intervention. There were also 2 dropouts from the control group as 1&#xD;
      participant was discharged from the nursing home in the second week of the study and another&#xD;
      one felt sick in the last week of intervention. Hence, data analysis was performed only for&#xD;
      15 participants in each group.&#xD;
