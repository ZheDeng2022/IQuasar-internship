  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the combination of lenvatinib with denosumab in bone-predominant&#xD;
      metastatic Radioiodine Refractory Differentiated Thyroid Carcinomas. All patients will&#xD;
      receive this combination of treatments.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients are usually considered for directed therapy (radiotherapy and/or surgery and/or&#xD;
      thermo-ablation) in case of symptomatic lesions or at high risk of local complications. They&#xD;
      also usually receive systemic bone-directed agents (bisphosphonate or denosumab), despite&#xD;
      sparse available data in the context of differentiated thyroid carcinomas (DTC). As&#xD;
      bone-directed agents have no antitumor activity, patients may require additional treatments.&#xD;
      To date, only sorafenib and lenvatinib have been approved in the treatment of advanced&#xD;
      Radioiodine Refractory Differentiated Thyroid Carcinomas (RR-DTC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lenvatinib demonstrated efficacy in RR-DTC compared to placebo. While other kinase inhibitors&#xD;
      appeared to be less effective in controlling bone metastatic disease compared to other soft&#xD;
      tissue sites, lenvatinib showed, in a small number of patients, significant decrease in bone&#xD;
      tumors size.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Even if both study drugs are indicated in the treatment of patients suffering from RR-DTC&#xD;
      with bone metastases, it is of essential importance to confirm that lenvatinib can provide&#xD;
      clinical benefit and antitumor activity when combined with denosumab in this population.&#xD;
