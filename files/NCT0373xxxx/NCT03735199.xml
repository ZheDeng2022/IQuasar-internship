  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Following tooth extraction, the socket heals naturally with bone in 1 to 2 months. This&#xD;
      healing process occurs with substantial reduction of the original height and width of the&#xD;
      alveolar ridge. In a significantly resorbed ridge, bone augmentation procedures are necessary&#xD;
      before dental implant placement. Autogenous bone is the gold standard for this purpose but&#xD;
      the harvesting procedure results in additional morbidities and expenses. Ridge preservation&#xD;
      techniques have been introduced, using xenografts, allografts or synthetic materials to fill&#xD;
      the tooth socket immediately after extraction. While the current materials used have improved&#xD;
      ridge dimensions to various extents, their osteoconductivity is suboptimal and unpredictable.&#xD;
      They do not reduce vertical resorption of the bony walls and often interfered with the normal&#xD;
      healing process. Polycaprolactone - tricalcium phosphate (PCL-TCP) is a bioactive,&#xD;
      bioresorbable composite polymer that is non-toxic and tissue-compatible. This study will test&#xD;
      the use of a novel 3D printed PCL-TCP device for ridge preservation, leveraging on its 3D&#xD;
      shape that fits snugly in the tooth socket, high porosity and bioactivity to promote&#xD;
      osteogenesis and reduce resorption. The hypothesis is that the insertion of a PCL-TCP&#xD;
      scaffold in extraction sockets allows normal bone healing and better maintenance of ridge&#xD;
      dimensions after 6 months compared to extraction sockets without a space filler. This will be&#xD;
      a prospective, randomized controlled clinical trial in patients who require single tooth&#xD;
      extraction and replacement with a dental implant. The study will compare the ridge dimensions&#xD;
      and the quality and quantity of bone formed in tooth sockets, using histology and&#xD;
      microcomputed tomography, in both groups after 6 months. The PCL-TCP scaffold to be used in&#xD;
      this study will be fabricated by a local spin-off company, Osteopore International Pte Ltd.&#xD;
      The market potential for this device is tremendous due to a growing demand for tooth&#xD;
      replacement from an ageing population worldwide.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This will be a prospective, non-blinded randomized controlled clinical trial in adult&#xD;
      patients who require single tooth extraction and who are suitable for dental implant therapy&#xD;
      after extraction. The participants will be randomised by a clinician, using sealed envelopes&#xD;
      that has been prepared by an independent party, to either the test or control group on a 1:1&#xD;
      ratio:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Test Group: insertion of PCL-TCP scaffold after tooth extraction Control Group: no space&#xD;
      filler after tooth extraction&#xD;
&#xD;
      Proposed study interventions 138 patients who give written consent to participating in the&#xD;
      study will be recruited from the Departments of Oral &amp; Maxillofacial Surgery and Restorative&#xD;
      Dentistry at the NDCS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pre-extraction Preparation Dental models and standardised dental radiographs, including&#xD;
      periapical and orthopantomogram, will be taken. A customised acrylic dental stent will be&#xD;
      fabricated as a reference tool for standardised measurement of ridge dimensions. Three&#xD;
      markings will be made (mesio-buccal, mid-buccal, disto-buccal) on the acrylic stent at the&#xD;
      intended extraction site.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Surgical Extraction and Socket Management&#xD;
&#xD;
      Under local anesthesia, a trapezoidal buccal mucoperiosteal flap will be raised and an&#xD;
      atraumatic extraction of the tooth will be performed. The tooth socket will be thoroughly&#xD;
      debrided and any granulation tissue will be curetted out. The acrylic measuring stent will&#xD;
      then be positioned by fitting it to the adjacent teeth and the following measurements will be&#xD;
      taken using a periodontal probe (PCPUNC15; Hu-Friedy USA):&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ridge height This will be measured indirectly as the vertical distance from each reference&#xD;
      marking on the stent to the marginal bone of the tooth socket at the mesio-buccal, mid-buccal&#xD;
      and disto-buccal aspects (Figure 1) and will recorded as RHmeb1, RHmib1 and RHdb1&#xD;
      respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ridge width This will be the horizontal distance from the buccal aspect to the lingual/&#xD;
      palatal aspect of the alveolar crest at the mid-buccal region of the extraction socket (RW1).&#xD;
&#xD;
      All measurements will be taken by 2 independent parties. Measurements that differ by less&#xD;
      than or equal to 1mm will be averaged. Those that differ by more than 1mm will be repeated&#xD;
      and a consensus will be reached by the parties. All measurements will be approximated to the&#xD;
      nearest 0.5 mm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The extraction sockets will be managed differently for the test and control groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Test Group&#xD;
&#xD;
      PCL-TCP scaffold:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The PCL-TCP scaffolds will be supplied by Osteopore International (Singapore). The scaffolds&#xD;
      will be fabricated by the latest FDM techniques (FDM 3000; Stratasys, Eden Prairie, MN), in a&#xD;
      class 10K clean room environment. Each scaffold will have a lay-down pattern of 0°/60°/120°,&#xD;
      porosity of 70% and will be conical in shape. The scaffolds will a typical honeycomb&#xD;
      structure with interconnected equilateral triangles of regular porous morphology. They will&#xD;
      be individually packed and sterilized using gamma irradiation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A suitable size scaffold will be chosen (small or large) based on the tooth to be extracted.&#xD;
      During the surgery, the scaffold will be shaped by cutting and shaving with a scalpel so as&#xD;
      to fit the extraction socket snugly at the crestal half to two-thirds aspect. A collagen&#xD;
      membrane will be placed over the scaffold at the crestal aspect of the socket. The periosteum&#xD;
      of the buccal flap will then be incised to allow a tension-free primary closure with 4/0&#xD;
      Vicryl® suture.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Control Group No space filler will be inserted in the extraction socket but similar to the&#xD;
      test group, a collagen membrane will be placed over the crestal aspect of the socket and the&#xD;
      periosteum of the buccal flap will be incised to allow a tension-free primary closure with&#xD;
      4/0 Vicryl® suture.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A periapical radiograph of the extraction site will be taken using standardised settings&#xD;
      immediately postoperatively. A 5-day course of Amoxicillin (or Clindamycin if the patient is&#xD;
      allergic to Penicillin) will be prescribed together with an analgesic and chlorhexidine&#xD;
      digluconate 0.2% mouthrinse. The sutures will be removed 1 week postoperatively. The surgical&#xD;
      site will be examined clinically for any signs of infection or wound dehiscence. A temporary&#xD;
      denture will be issued where necessary. The denture overlying the extraction site will be&#xD;
      completely relieved.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stage I Dental Implant Surgery Surgical placement of a dental implant will be performed at 6&#xD;
      months after tooth extraction. Radiographs, including a periapical of the study site, will be&#xD;
      taken before the surgery. Following local anaesthesia and elevation of a full-thickness&#xD;
      mucoperiosteal flap, the site will be clinically observed for any signs of inflammation,&#xD;
      infection and presence of fibrous or bone tissue ingrowth. The same customised acrylic stent&#xD;
      used for the case at the time of the tooth extraction will be used for measuring new ridge&#xD;
      height dimensions in a manner similar to that described previously. Readings will be recorded&#xD;
      as RHmeb2, RHmib2 and RHdb2. Ridge width will be measured as previously described and&#xD;
      recorded as RW2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patient in either the test or control group will be taken out of the study at this stage&#xD;
      if it is found that the extraction site has undergone extensive bone resorption such as to&#xD;
      warrant simultaneous bone grafting with implant placement or pre-implant bone grafting with&#xD;
      delayed implant placement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior to implant placement, a core of bone of 2 mm diameter and 6 mm length at the healed&#xD;
      extraction site will be obtained using a trephine bur (3i Implant Innovations Inc.; USA). The&#xD;
      core of bone will be fixed and stored in 10% neutral buffered formalin and sent for&#xD;
      microcomputed tomography (micro CT) scanning and histological preparation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The implant site will be prepared using successive drills, according to the Straumann®&#xD;
      (Institut Straumann AG, Basel, Switzerland) dental implant surgical protocol. A dental&#xD;
      implant (Straumann® Bone Level) of the appropriate length and diameter will then be inserted&#xD;
      at an insertion torque of between 20 Ncm and 40 Ncm. After placement of the dental implant,&#xD;
      Implant Stability Quotient (ISQ) will be measured by Resonance Frequency Analysis (RFA) using&#xD;
      the Osstell® machine. A cover screw will be placed over the implant. A releasing incision of&#xD;
      the periosteum will be done if necessary and the surgical wound will be closed primarily with&#xD;
      4/0 Vicryl®.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A 5-day course of Amoxicillin (or Clindamycin if the patient was allergic to Penicillin) will&#xD;
      be prescribed postoperatively, together with an analgesic and chlorhexidine digluconate 0.2%&#xD;
      mouthrinse. The sutures will be removed 1 week postoperatively. The surgical site will be&#xD;
      examined clinically for any signs of infection or wound dehiscence. The denture overlying the&#xD;
      extraction site will be completely relieved.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stage II Dental Implant Surgery This will be performed 3 months after Stage I dental implant&#xD;
      surgery. The site will be observed for any signs of inflammation, infection as well as&#xD;
      clinical stability of the dental implant. ISQ will be measured by RFA using the Osstell®&#xD;
      machine before attachment of the healing abutment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analyses&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Clinical Analysis of Bone Resorption&#xD;
&#xD;
           The amount of vertical bone resorption in millimeters (mm) at 3 aspects will be&#xD;
           calculated:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Mesio-buccal: RHmeb2 - RHmeb1 Mid-buccal: RHmib2 - RHmib1 Disto-buccal: RHdb2 - RHdb1&#xD;
&#xD;
           The amount of horizontal bone resorption in millimeters at the mid-buccal aspect will be&#xD;
           calculated:&#xD;
&#xD;
           RW1 - RW2&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. ISQ ISQ at Stage I and II dental implant surgery will be measured by 2 independent&#xD;
           parties using RFA for both the test and control groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Radiopacity Grading Scale The degree of radiopacity of the tooth socket observed on the&#xD;
           periapical radiograph taken at 6 months post-extraction in both the test and control&#xD;
           groups will be graded according to the following scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
      1 = radiolucent similar to tooth socket* 2 = increased radiopacity but less than surrounding&#xD;
      bone 3 = increased radiopacity similar to surrounding bone 4 = increased radiopacity more&#xD;
      than surrounding bone&#xD;
&#xD;
      * compared with baseline periapical taken of tooth socket immediately after surgical&#xD;
      extraction&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigator performing the grading will be blinded to the grouping of the radiographs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4) Micro CT Analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
      Quantitative analysis of bone regeneration in the test and control specimens will be&#xD;
      performed using micro CT (SkyScan 1076, Kontich, Belgium). The specimens, consisting of 2 mm&#xD;
      diameter by 6 mm length core of bone, will be placed in a sample holder and scanned through&#xD;
      180° at a spatial resolution of 30μm. The image data from the scanned planes will be&#xD;
      subsequently thresholded, reconstructed to create 3D images and analysed using VGStudio Max&#xD;
      1.1 and CT Analyzer software (Volume Graphics GmbH, Heidelberg, Germany). The region of&#xD;
      interest (ROI) will be defined by the boundaries of the specimen of each slice. The ROI will&#xD;
      be interpolated through the entire length of the specimen to form the volume of interest&#xD;
      (VOI). To select the area for bone, a bone-defining threshold will be set manually and kept&#xD;
      constant for all the images. The percentage bone volume (BV%) will be obtained from the ratio&#xD;
      of bone volume (BV) to total volume (TV):&#xD;
&#xD;
      BV% = BV/ TV&#xD;
&#xD;
      5) Histological Analysis After micro CT scanning, the specimens will be dehydrated in a&#xD;
      graded series of ethanol, embedded in glycol methacrylate resin and polymerised. The block&#xD;
      will be trimmed to remove excess plastic with an industrial vertical band saw and cut along&#xD;
      its long axis with a diamond band saw (EXAKT standard saw). Ground polished sections of 10 μm&#xD;
      thickness will be made using the EXAKT micro grinder system (EXAKT Technologies, Inc.,&#xD;
      Oklahoma City, OK) and will be subsequently stained with Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&amp;E),&#xD;
      Goldner's trichrome and von Kossa for descriptive histology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      (iii) Methods for protecting against other sources of bias (eg. blinding or masking. If&#xD;
      blinding is not possible, please explain why and give details of alternative methods proposed&#xD;
      or implications for interpretation of trials results)&#xD;
&#xD;
      As this study will compare the use of a device in a tooth socket (test group) versus no&#xD;
      device (control group), blinding is not possible. To reduce bias, 2 independent parties will&#xD;
      perform the ridge dimension and ISQ measurements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigator performing the Radiopacity Grading Scale will be blinded to the grouping of&#xD;
      the radiographs. Blinding for the micro CT and histology analyses is not possible as the&#xD;
      presence/ absence of PCL-TCP scaffold will be obvious in the specimens.&#xD;
