             a target lesion not subjected to local therapy and/or disease progression has been&#xD;
             documented in the target lesion subjected to local therapy. The treatment must be&#xD;
             completed at least 4 weeks and patient has recovered from all the acute toxicities of&#xD;
             that treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. At least 28 days, or at least 5 half-lives (whichever is shorter), since last systemic&#xD;
             therapy (i.e., chemotherapy, targeted therapy, immunotherapy) before the first dosing&#xD;
             of TG02, and have recovered from any clinically significant toxicity associated with&#xD;
             such treatment;&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. HCC subjects must be of Child-Pugh class A (not amenable to or refractory to&#xD;
             locoregional therapy). Subjects with HCC associated with hepatitis B virus must be&#xD;
             receiving adequate antiviral therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Must have at least 1 measurable lesion per RECIST 1.1 and evidence of disease&#xD;
             progression since the last anti-tumor therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Adequate hematologic, renal and hepatic function:&#xD;
&#xD;

             of normal (ULN) Bilirubin ≤2 x ULN (except subjects with Gilbert's syndrome, who must&#xD;
             have total bilirubin &lt;3.0mg/dL) INR ≤1.5&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Persistent clinically significant toxicities from prior chemotherapy must be ≤ grade&#xD;

             the study. For this study, acceptable methods of contraception include a reliable&#xD;
             intrauterine device or a spermicide in combination with a barrier method. Hormonal&#xD;
             forms of birth control (oral, implantable, or injectable) may only be used if combined&#xD;
             with a barrier method.&#xD;
