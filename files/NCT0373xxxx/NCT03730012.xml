  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the safety and tolerability of gilteritinib given&#xD;
      in combination with atezolizumab in participants with relapsed or treatment refractory&#xD;
      FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3) mutated AML and to determine the composite complete&#xD;
      remission (CRc) rate for participants who either discontinued the study or completed 2 cycles&#xD;
      of gilteritinib given in combination with atezolizumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will also evaluate pharmacokinetics (PK), response to treatment, remission and&#xD;
      survival. Adverse events (AEs), clinical laboratory results, vital signs, electrocardiograms&#xD;
      (ECGs), and Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status scores will also be&#xD;
      assessed.&#xD;

      This study will have 2 phases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 1:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The phase 1 portion of this study is to establish the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of&#xD;
      gilteritinib given in combination with atezolizumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 2:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The phase 2 portion of the study will treat patients with gilteritinib and atezolizumab at&#xD;
      the RP2D and will enroll in two stages. The first stage will evaluate the remission rate and&#xD;
      if a minimum rate is achieved, a second stage of enrollment will continue.&#xD;
