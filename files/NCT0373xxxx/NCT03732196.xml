  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The present study aims to evaluate the reproducibility and relative validity of a&#xD;
      semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) to assess food group consumption and&#xD;
      nutrient intake for Chinese pregnant women in Hong Kong.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 100 apparently healthy pregnant women aged 18 or above and with gestational age of&#xD;
      at least 5 weeks willl be recruited from the antenatal clinic of the Prince of Wales&#xD;
      Hospital. The research staff will check for eligible subjects, explain study details and&#xD;
      invite them to join the study. Written consent will be obtained from all subjects. Various&#xD;
      maternal data will be collected using standardized methods and questionnaires, and retrieved&#xD;
      from the hospital record.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each participant will be asked to complete the FFQ twice within 3 to 4 weeks interval (for&#xD;
      reproducibility evaluation), and three 24-hour food recalls in between the two&#xD;
      administrations of the FFQ as a reference method to validate the FFQ (for validity&#xD;
      evaluation). The three 24-hour food recalls will include two weekdays and one weekend day. On&#xD;
      the interview day in which the 1st FFQ is administrated (FFQ1), each participant will be&#xD;
      explained by trained research staff on how to complete the FFQ by herself with the provision&#xD;
      of the food portion booklet. Each participant will be asked to complete the 1st FFQ regarding&#xD;
      her intake of various food groups over the past month. The frequency of food group intake&#xD;
      will be reported per day, week or month, and portions will be reported based on standard&#xD;
      referent portion sizes, as pieces, glasses, cups, spoons, centilitres or grams. Data on use&#xD;
      of supplements will be collected by asking subjects to specify the brand, the frequency, and&#xD;
      the dosage of supplements used. On the same interview day, participant will also be asked by&#xD;
      trained research staff to recall all foods and beverages that have been consumed over the&#xD;
      past 24 hours. Food photo albums and eating utensils of standardized portions will be&#xD;
      displayed to help recall. The 2nd administration of the FFQ (FFQ2) will be done 3 to 4 weeks&#xD;
      after the 1st administration of the FFQ. The FFQ2 and the food portion booklet as well as the&#xD;
      additional 24-hour recall forms will be given to the participants by email or post within 3&#xD;
      to 4 weeks after the 1st administration of the FFQ (FFQ1). Between the intervals of two FFQs,&#xD;
      the research staff will give phone call to the participant on two separate days to complete&#xD;
      two more 24-hour food recalls for validity evaluation purpose. Daily dietary and nutrient&#xD;
      intake collected by both FFQs and 24-hour recalls will be entered and calculated using the&#xD;
      nutrition analysis software Food Processor Nutrition analysis and Fitness software version&#xD;
      8.0 (ESHA Research, Salem, USA) including local foods selected from food composition tables&#xD;
      from China and Hong Kong.&#xD;
