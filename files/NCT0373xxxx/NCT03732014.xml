      This study will be conducted in Ojha Institute of Chest Diseases and Department of Medicine,&#xD;
      Dow Medical College, Karachi both affiliated with Dow University of Health Sciences, Karachi,&#xD;
      Pakistan after IRB approval. All patients of either gender with clinical suspicion of PTB on&#xD;
      history, examination and CXR and not expectorating sputum or less than 1 ml will be included&#xD;
      in the study. Patients with extra pulmonary tuberculosis, those with age &lt; 12 years will be&#xD;
      excluded. Demographic data of selected patients including age, gender, contact with PTB&#xD;
      patient will be collected. Data will be entered in study proforma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Selected patients will undergo bronchoscopy using Olympus 180 series video bronchoscope.&#xD;
      Bronchial Wash will be done and 3 aliquots of BW samples will be collected by suctioning. One&#xD;
      part of washing will be immediately inoculated in AFB Culture media and second will be&#xD;
      submitted for Xpert MTB/RIF testing. Third part will be centrifuged, and sediment will be&#xD;
      subjected to AFB microscopy after staining with Ziehl-Neelsen technique.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Results of microscopy and Xpert MTB/RIF will be collected next day, and treatment will be&#xD;
      started if MTB comes positive, while results of AFB Culture will be collected after 6 weeks&#xD;
      and treatment will be started if not already started on previous reports.&#xD;
      Sensitivity/Resistance pattern will be recorded for both Xpert MTB/RIF and ABF Culture.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sample size of 72 was taken for conduct of study. Sample size calculations were done&#xD;
      using PASS software version 15.0. Frequency of positive tests will be calculated. Mean age&#xD;
      will be calculated according to gender and compared by Student's t-test. Sensitivity &amp;&#xD;
      specificity of tests will be calculated using online calculator by VassarStats. Frequency of&#xD;
      positive yield of Xpert MTB/RIF will be compared to that of microscopy by χ2- test. P-value&#xD;
      of &lt;0.05 was considered significant.&#xD;

      This cross-sectional study will be conducted in Ojha Institute of Chest Diseases and&#xD;
      Department of Medicine, Dow Medical College, Karachi both affiliated with Dow University of&#xD;
      Health Sciences, Karachi, Pakistan after IRB approval. Patients were informed of study&#xD;
      protocol, benefits and risks and written consent will be taken. All patients of either gender&#xD;
      with clinical suspicion of PTB on history, examination and CXR and not expectorating sputum&#xD;
      or less than 1 ml will be included in the study. Patients with extra pulmonary tuberculosis,&#xD;
      those with age &lt; 12 years will be excluded. Demographic data of selected patients including&#xD;
      age, gender, contact with PTB patient will be collected. Data will be entered in study&#xD;
      proforma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Selected patients will undergo bronchoscopy using Olympus 180 series video bronchoscope. BW&#xD;
      will be done by instilling 60 ml of normal saline via bronchoscope and 3 aliquots of BW&#xD;
      samples will be collected by suctioning. One part of washing will be immediately inoculated&#xD;
      in AFB Culture media and second will be submitted for Xpert MTB/RIF testing. Third part will&#xD;
      be centrifuged, and sediment will be subjected to AFB microscopy after staining with&#xD;
      Ziehl-Neelsen technique.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Results of microscopy and Xpert MTB/RIF will be collected next day, and treatment will be&#xD;
      started if MTB comes positive, while results of AFB Culture will be collected after 6 weeks&#xD;
      and treatment will be started if not already started on previous reports.&#xD;
      Sensitivity/Resistance pattern will be recorded for both Xpert MTB/RIF and ABF Culture.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size was calculated using reported both for smear microscopy and Xpert MTB/RIF. Using&#xD;
      the reported sensitivity of Xpert MTB/RIF of 82.4% by Rakotoarivelo R, et al and keeping the&#xD;
      power at 95% and alpha at 0.05 the sample size for Xpert MTB/RIF is estimated as 25. For&#xD;
      smear microscopy the reported sensitivity of 70.47% by Chowdhury R et al was used and sample&#xD;
      size of 72 was calculated using same parameters as those for Xpert MTB/RIF. Higher sample&#xD;
      size of 72 was taken for conduct of study. Sample size calculations were done using PASS&#xD;
      software version 15.0. Frequency of positive tests will be calculated. Mean age will be&#xD;
      calculated according to gender and compared by Student's t-test. Sensitivity &amp; specificity of&#xD;
      tests will be calculated using online calculator by VassarStats. Frequency of positive yield&#xD;
      of Xpert MTB/RIF will be compared to that of microscopy by χ2- test. P-value of &lt;0.05 was&#xD;
      considered significant.&#xD;
