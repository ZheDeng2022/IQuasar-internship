    <textblock>
      Anger is the mostly commonly reported reintegration concern among combat Veterans, especially&#xD;
      those with PTSD. Problematic anger is associated with significant functional impairment. In&#xD;
      the current project, the investigators will pilot-test a newly developed mobile app, entitled&#xD;
      Mobile Intervention for Reducing Anger (MIRA), among Veterans with PTSD and problematic&#xD;
      anger. The project will compare the MIRA app to a contact control condition. The&#xD;
      investigators hypothesize that Veterans with PTSD and problematic anger will find the MIRA&#xD;
      app acceptable and will be willing to use it to reduce their anger difficulties and improve&#xD;
      psychosocial and occupational functioning.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Anger is the mostly commonly reported reintegration concern among combat Veterans, especially&#xD;
      those with PTSD. Problematic anger is associated with significant functional impairment. One&#xD;
      of the mechanisms associated with problematic anger and aggression is hostile interpretation&#xD;
      bias, i.e., a tendency to interpret ambiguous interpersonal situations as hostile. The&#xD;
      investigator has previously developed and piloted a computer-based interpretation bias&#xD;
      modification intervention that successfully reduces both hostile interpretation bias and&#xD;
      anger outcomes. In the current project, the investigators will pilot-test a mobile&#xD;
      application version of the existing computer-based intervention, entitled Mobile Intervention&#xD;
      for Reducing Anger (MIRA), among Veterans with PTSD and problematic anger. The project will&#xD;
      compare the MIRA app to a contact control condition to evaluate the feasibility of&#xD;
      recruitment, randomization, and retention procedures. The investigators will also utilize&#xD;
      psychophysiological and electronic diary monitoring to determine whether this assessment&#xD;
      could be used as an outcome or mechanistic variable in a subsequent randomized clinical trial&#xD;
      application focused on evaluating the efficacy of the MIRA intervention.&#xD;

    <description>This is a mobile intervention that uses interpretation bias modification (IBM) techniques to reduce the hostile interpretation bias. Participants will be given a mobile device with the MIRA app and instructed to complete 5 treatment sessions each week for a period of 4 weeks. Each session takes approximately 10 minutes. The app also includes a Nightly Diary to track symptoms, a calendar to program session reminders, and a My Progress feature to track use and performance.</description>

    <description>This is a mobile intervention that uses the Mindful Breathing and Body Scan exercises from the &quot;Mindfulness Coach&quot; app. These audio-guided exercises take approximately 10 minutes each. Participants will be given a mobile device with the Mindfulness app and instructed to complete 5 exercises (i.e., Body Scan or Mindful Breathing) each week for a period of 4 weeks. The app also includes a Nightly Diary to track symptoms, a calendar to program reminders, and a My Progress feature to track use and performance.</description>
