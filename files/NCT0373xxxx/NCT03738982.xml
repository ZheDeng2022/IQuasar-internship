    <textblock>
      Patient Empowerment through Predictive PERsonalised decision support (PEPPER) is an European&#xD;
      Union (EU) funded research project to develop a personalised clinical decision support system&#xD;
      for Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus (T1DM) self-management. The tool provides insulin bolus dose&#xD;
      advice, tailored to the needs of individuals. The system uses Case-Based Reasoning (CBR), an&#xD;
      artificial intelligence methodology that adapts to new situations according to past&#xD;
      experience. The PEPPER system also incorporates a safety module that promotes safety by&#xD;
      providing glucose alarms, low-glucose insulin suspension, carbohydrate recommendations and&#xD;
      fault detection.The principal research objectives are to assess the usability, safety, and&#xD;
      technical proof of concept and feasibility of the PEPPER in participants with T1DM.&#xD;
      Evaluation of safety is a priority and will be assessed throughout the clinical studies. The&#xD;
      safety components only of the PEPPER system will initially be evaluated in an out-of-clinic&#xD;
      environment (phase 1) and will measure incidence and percentage time spent in hypoglycaemia,&#xD;
      evaluate usability and incidence of technical faults. Following the initial safety study, the&#xD;
      overall PEPPER system (integrated with the CBR algorithm) will be assessed (phase 2) and the&#xD;
      primary outcome will be percentage time spent in hypoglycaemia.&#xD;

      1. Description of the components of the PEPPER system:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Decision support algorithm The decision support algorithm is based on case-based reasoning&#xD;
      (CBR). CBR is an artificial intelligence technique that tries to solve newly encountered&#xD;
      problems by applying the solutions learned from solved problems encountered in the past. A&#xD;
      combination of parameters makes up the case problem presented to the CBR algorithm. Using&#xD;
      this information the algorithm will find a similar case scenario from the pool of previously&#xD;
      encountered cases and recommend an improved solution (insulin dose) to achieve the best&#xD;
      possible outcome (post-prandial blood glucose). Each new case includes information about the&#xD;
      problem (e.g. capillary blood glucose, meal information etc), solution (recommended insulin&#xD;
      dose) and outcome (post-prandial blood glucose).&#xD;
&#xD;
      PEPPER offers a dual architecture for both Multiple Daily Injections (MDI) or Continuous&#xD;
      Subcutaneous Insulin Infusion (CSII) therapy. In both cases, the user periodically wears a&#xD;
      continuous glucose monitor (CGM) and an activity monitor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Handset CSII version: The handset is a portable touch-screen device, which communicates&#xD;
      directly with the insulin pump. Its primary function in PEPPER is to allow the user to&#xD;
      precisely manage insulin therapy by accepting or rejecting bolus insulin dose&#xD;
      recommendations, calculated by the CBR based decision support algorithm, via a graphical&#xD;
      interface. In addition, it measures and automatically records glucose levels (via a built-in&#xD;
      Blood Glucose (BG) strip reader) and allows logging of food intake and other parameters.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MDI version: This handset is a commercially available Smartphone with the insulin&#xD;
      recommendation application running locally on a standard operating system such as iPhone&#xD;
      Operating System (iOS) or Android. It has the same functionality as the CSII version, except&#xD;
      that it does not have a built-in capillary blood glucose (CBG) reader but instead imports&#xD;
      data wirelessly from external CBG monitors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secure web server Revision: The handset wirelessly reports the user's case history to the&#xD;
      secure portal, a web site which allows the clinician to add new patients, and review the&#xD;
      cases to decide which ones should be kept. A case comprises multiple parameters such as&#xD;
      carbohydrate intake, BG reading, meal composition, physical activity and hormone cycle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Personal Health Record on the secure portal allows patients and clinicians to view and update&#xD;
      selected components of the detailed history.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Insulin delivery system MDI: will continue using the same insulin they were on. CSII: will&#xD;
      use the Cellnovo insulin pump.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Continuous glucose monitoring system The glucose sensor that will be used throughout the&#xD;
      clinical studies is the Dexcom sensor (CE marked, manufactured by Dexcom). This current is&#xD;
      proportional to the glucose concentration in interstitial fluid and is calibrated against&#xD;
      blood glucose a minimum of 12-hourly. The Dexcom CGM data is automatically transmitted to a&#xD;
      secure web-based server and the secure PEPPER web-portal. Participants will be able to see&#xD;
      their CGM data at all times and this will be used continuously throughout the studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety features Low and high glucose alarms will be incorporated to alert the user when hypo-&#xD;
      and hyperglycaemia is detected to enable the user to act accordingly to bring the glucose&#xD;
      levels back to target range.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Glucose prediction algorithm for hypoglycaemia prediction The hypoglycaemia prediction&#xD;
      algorithm will enable the system to automatically activate the low glucose suspension feature&#xD;
      in pump participants (suspension of insulin delivery until glucose levels are within the&#xD;
      target range) and/or trigger an adaptive carbohydrate adviser, which will recommend a&#xD;
      personalised carbohydrate snack.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Insulin safety constraints Personalised maximum insulin dose thresholds will be incorporated&#xD;
      to prevent overdosing on insulin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fault detection Insulin pumps and CGMs are well-established technologies, but faults in these&#xD;
      devices (e.g. pump occlusion, loss of sensor sensitivity) may occur. A fault detection system&#xD;
      will identify such faults and alert the user to recommend a corresponding action to revert to&#xD;
      the normal state.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have the opportunity to call a physician for medical support and an&#xD;
      engineer for technical support 24 hours a day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.2 Recruitment This is a multicentre study and recruiting for the clinical study will be&#xD;
      undertaken in the diabetes clinics at the Institut d'Investigació Biomédica de Girona&#xD;
      (IdIBGi) (Spain) and the Imperial College London (ICL) (UK) from registered research&#xD;
      databases and from interested participants who contact us.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.3 Clinical studies: 2.3.1 Phase 1&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: To demonstrate safety and technical proof of concept of the PEPPER safety system&#xD;
      (without the CBR algorithm) in the participant's own environment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary outcome and secondary outcomes are defined in Outcome Measures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Timescale: Each participant will be in the study for 8 weeks: run-in period (2 weeks period)&#xD;
      and intervention period (6 weeks period). It is anticipated that it will take 6 months to&#xD;
      complete this phase.&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
      Objective: To demonstrate safety and technical proof of concept of the overall PEPPER system&#xD;
      (integrated with the CBR algorithm).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary outcome and secondary outcomes are defined in Outcome Measures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Timescale and population are the same as in phase 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 1: Screening Same as for phase 1&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 2: CGM review and study start Switch on the PEPPER handset (CBR algorithm and PEPPER&#xD;
      safety system enabled) The rest of steps the same as in phase 1 visit 2&#xD;

&#xD;
      Visit 4: 6-week visit (6 weeks after visit 2) Same as in phase 1 visit 4&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 5: Final visit Step 5 of usability study&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.3.3 Usability study&#xD;
&#xD;
      Usability of the system will be evaluated throughout the clinical trial phases and&#xD;
      redevelopment of the system will be done accordingly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives: to evaluate usability of the PEPPER handsets over a sustained time period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Step 1: Training observation Participants will be trained in use of devices. The handset will&#xD;
      be filmed during the training to see which aspect is being described.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Step 2: Contextual interview The aim is to gather data at an early stage of the usability&#xD;
      engineering process. They will be used to understand the intended use of all parts of the&#xD;
      system and the characteristics that relate to safety, within an everyday context. The&#xD;
      interview will be semi-structured with choice of questions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Step 3: Diary study Data will be collected via the Smartphone in a variety of formats. The&#xD;
      study follows on from the contextual interview and concludes with an exit interview.&#xD;
      Participants will also be phoned at weekly intervals to see how they are finding the bolus&#xD;
      advice and to check that there are no problems.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection. Participants will be asked to make diary entries each time they use the&#xD;
      PEPPER bolus advisor. Data will be collected using a Smartphone app. It may take a variety of&#xD;
      formats including photos, voice memos, text. In addition, written notes will be made after&#xD;
      each weekly phone call.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Step 4: Diary exit interview The purpose is to drill down into some of the diary entries to&#xD;
      discover supplementary information. Participants will be asked to review each of the diary&#xD;
      entries, giving further explanation.This will be followed by an unstructured interview.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The diary will be filmed during the conversation to see which entry is being described.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Step 5: Contextual group All of the members of the feasibility study will be invited to a&#xD;
      social meeting in an informal location. The purpose of the session will be to validate the&#xD;
      findings from the previous steps.The researcher will endeavour to be an unobtrusive bystander&#xD;
      in the discussion, and not offer personal opinions but listen for common issues and themes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection. Data will be gathered on a notepad or laptop in a visible way.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will be gathered using an audio recorder in steps 1-4.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.4 Statistics The sample size is comparable to other technology pilot safety studies, is a&#xD;
      realistic number for recruitment and provides robust safety data. The study is not powered to&#xD;
      show a change in the primary or secondary outcomes compared with usual care but is an&#xD;
      assessment of a new technology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.5 Confidentiality of data collected during interviews To ensure security, data obtained&#xD;
      during the course of the interviews will be encrypted and stored securely, with access&#xD;
      limited solely to the researchers. Data will be de-identified such that only the researchers&#xD;
      will be able to link the data to the participant involved using reversible codes. This is&#xD;
      done purely for the purpose of comparison and evaluation across the separate interviews. Any&#xD;
      resulting publications using the data will not identify the participants, and any quotes will&#xD;
      kept anonymous should participants consent to this.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.6 Electronic data storage on secure web-server Data security and privacy will be a priority&#xD;
      whilst dealing with medical data such as that held in the PEPPER system. During the clinical&#xD;
      studies (phases 1-2) anonymous clinical data will be entered and stored on a secure&#xD;
      web-server. Anonymous data collected by the PEPPER handset (such as glucose, meal&#xD;
      information, physical activity, alcohol, exercise) and the Dexcom CGM system will be&#xD;
      automatically transmitted to the secure web-server. For this purpose, EU regulatory&#xD;
      procedures (Directives 95/46/EC and 2002/58/EC) will be observed. Medical data will be stored&#xD;
      and protected against non-authorised access; transmission of data will be secured; only&#xD;
      authorised users will have access to services and stored data. Authentication will be&#xD;
      required for application use and data synchronisation. PEPPER will operate according to&#xD;
      standard interoperability guidelines (e.g. HL7), so that information can be exchanged&#xD;
      seamlessly between the various components. Authorised users will include study team members&#xD;
      from the PEPPER collaborators. Collaborators will only be able to view anonymous PEPPER&#xD;
      handset data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The data generated by the study will be analysed by the collaborative PEPPER research team at&#xD;
      their respective sites. The analysis will be on anonymised data which will be aggregated&#xD;
      during joint meetings on either clinical site.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Missing, unused, and spurious data will be assessed on an individual basis and may be&#xD;
      ignored, withdrawn or the visit may be removed from the analysis with appropriate&#xD;
      justification adjudicated by the Principal Investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.7 Adverse Events (AEs) Reporting Procedures All adverse events will be reported. Depending&#xD;
      on the nature of the event the reporting procedures below will be followed. Any questions&#xD;
      concerning adverse event reporting will be directed to the Chief Investigator in the first&#xD;
      instance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Non serious AEs: All such events will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Serious Adverse Events (SAEs): An SAE form will be completed and faxed to the Chief&#xD;
      Investigator within 24 hours. However, hospitalisations for elective treatment of a&#xD;
      pre-existing condition do not need reporting as SAEs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Reports of related and unexpected SAEs will be submitted within 15 days of the Chief&#xD;
      Investigator becoming aware of the event. The Chief Investigator will also notify the Sponsor&#xD;
      of all SAEs, where in the opinion of the Chief Investigator, the event is:&#xD;
&#xD;
      'related', i.e resulted from the administration of any of the research procedures; and&#xD;
      'unexpected', i.e an event that is not listed in the protocol as an expected occurrence Local&#xD;
      investigators will report any SAEs as required by their Local Research Ethics Committee,&#xD;
      Sponsor and/or Research &amp; Development Office.&#xD;
