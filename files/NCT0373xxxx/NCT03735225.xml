  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the trial is to characterize the safety and tolerability of dasiglucagon 4&#xD;
      mg/mL following IV administration at increasing doses in healthy volunteers. One cohort of&#xD;
      subjects will receive a SC dose of dasiglucagon to characterize the bioavailability of&#xD;
      dasiglucagon following SC administration compared to IV administration. Furthermore, the&#xD;
      trial aims to assess the potential effect of dasiglucagon on corrected QT interval (QTc)&#xD;
      prolongation via a concentrationresponse analysis.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hypoglycemia in patients with diabetes is defined as episodes of an abnormally low plasma&#xD;
      glucose concentration. Hypoglycemia is a common, unpredictable, and potentially dangerous&#xD;
      side effect of treatment of diabetes mellitus, especially with insulin or sulfonylureas.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dasiglucagon (ZP4207) is a stable peptide analog of human glucagon, available in a&#xD;
      ready-to-use liquid formulation. Dasiglucagon is in development for the treatment of severe&#xD;
      hypoglycemia in patients with diabetes mellitus. Dasiglucagon is a specific and full glucagon&#xD;
      receptor agonist designed to mimic the effects of glucagon, having a fast absorption and&#xD;
      elimination (minutes).&#xD;
