      This study tests the effectiveness of patient navigation for increasing enrollment in&#xD;
      substance abuse treatment programs and preventing readmission to detoxification. Participants&#xD;
      will be randomized to receive motivational interviewing or motivation interviewing plus&#xD;
      patient navigation.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary goal of alcohol detoxification is to medically manage acute intoxication and&#xD;
      withdrawal. Its secondary goal of fostering entry into longer-term alcohol treatment&#xD;
      post-detoxification is often overlooked. This leads to a revolving door characterized by a&#xD;
      cyclical pattern of discharges and re-admissions to detoxification. This pattern is observed&#xD;
      across the US among alcohol detoxification patients and is even more prevalent among Alaska&#xD;
      Native people; few transition to alcohol treatment following detoxification and approximately&#xD;
      40% are readmitted within 1 year. The revolving door is costly to patients and providers.&#xD;
      Current estimates associated with the cost of detoxification are not available. A study over&#xD;
      25 years ago indicated the average inpatient detoxification stay was over $3,300. Although&#xD;
      the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Administration recognizes that better linkages are&#xD;
      needed to transition people to treatment following detoxification, few interventions have&#xD;
      tested ways to improve this transition; none of these prior studies included either Alaska&#xD;
      Natives or American Indians.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study proposes to use patient navigators to guide and assist patients in their&#xD;
      transition to the appropriate levels of treatment, and to help eliminate barriers that&#xD;
      obstruct treatment entry. This is a randomized controlled trial of the patient navigation&#xD;
      intervention with 612 patients. We will estimate the costs of implementing and sustaining&#xD;
      this intervention as well as its economic value. The control condition will include 1 session&#xD;
      of motivational interviewing lasting approximately 45 minutes to 1 hour. The intervention&#xD;
      group will also receive motivational interviewing and in addition will work with a patient&#xD;
      navigator to facilitate entry into the appropriate level of care and provide ongoing support&#xD;
      until the patient is admitted to treatment or the intervention period ends.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Adapt patient navigation (Transitions to Recovery) to fit the patient population and&#xD;
           test its effectiveness in increasing successful transition to post-detoxification&#xD;
           substance abuse treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Test patient navigation's effectiveness in preventing readmission to detoxification.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Perform a comprehensive economic evaluation of patient navigation (Transition to&#xD;
           Recovery) by using cost-benefit analyses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If effective, this intervention may be a cost-effective means of transitioning detoxification&#xD;
      patients to treatment across health care systems nationally.&#xD;
