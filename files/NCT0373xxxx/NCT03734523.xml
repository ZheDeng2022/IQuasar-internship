      Background&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bacterial Vaginosis is the most common vaginal infection in women in their reproductive years&#xD;
      and a difficult one to treat. In the United States, the National Health and Nutrition&#xD;
      Examination Survey (NHANES), estimated the prevalence of BV was 29 percent in the general&#xD;
      population of women aged 14 to 49 years and 50 percent in African-American women. It is&#xD;
      characterized by a shift in vaginal flora from an acidic environment due to acid producing&#xD;
      lactobacilli to a mixture of anaerobic and facultative microorganisms. BV causes symptoms of&#xD;
      vaginal odor, itching, discharge and irritation and can greatly impact a woman's health,&#xD;
      quality of life, sexual relations, self-image and well-being. BV has also been associated&#xD;
      with an increased risk of preterm labor, STD acquisition and vaginal cuff cellulitis after&#xD;
      hysterectomy6. After treatment with antibiotics, recurrences are common. About 15-30% will&#xD;
      have recurrence in 3 months7.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Normal vaginal flora is lactobacilli dominant. Lactobacilli maintain vaginal pH in the acidic&#xD;
      range and keep the growth of BV associated bacteria at low levels. Lactobacilli also produce&#xD;
      proteins with bactericidal activity which help to maintain their dominance. Anything that&#xD;
      alters the vaginal flora and changes the pH to a more basic environment may increase the risk&#xD;
      of BV.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently, there are many sexual lubricants and vaginal moisturizers available on the market.&#xD;
      It has recently been shown that many of these are hyperosmolar and it is thought that&#xD;
      hyperosmolar lubricants can be damaging to the epithelium and may alter the pH of the vagina.&#xD;
      It is postulated that lubricants and moisturizers may predispose to BV by altering the pH of&#xD;
      the vagina.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Flourish Vaginal Care System, by Good Clean Love, includes the following three products:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Restore, a 510K-cleared moisturizing personal lubricant that has been on the market for 3&#xD;
      years. It is available without a prescription. It is formulated to bio-match the vaginal&#xD;
      secretions of women with L. crispatus-dominated microbiota. Restore has a pH of 3.7 with&#xD;
      racemic 1% lactic acid, and is iso-osmolar with serum. It is, therefore, much less likely to&#xD;
      alter the acid base balance of the vagina, and therefore less likely to predispose to BV.&#xD;
&#xD;
      BiopHresh Vaginal Probiotic Suppository, a Bio Matched probiotic homeopathic formulation&#xD;
      which provides a clinically-tested combination of lactobacilli including L. crispatus and&#xD;
      other strains found in the most stable vaginal microbiome. Research has shown as many as 30%&#xD;
      of women do not naturally produce these critical strains of lactobacilli.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Balance Moisturizing Personal Wash is a gentle, pH-balancing cleanser with soothing botanical&#xD;
      extracts, formulated with more than 60% premium aloe. It is made without toxic saponifiers&#xD;
      found in most bar soaps and OTC cleansers, which tend to disrupt the cell to cell adhesion&#xD;
      barrier8.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to determine if Flourish Vaginal Care System aids in re-establishing&#xD;
      and maintaining a healthy vaginal microbiome by restoring the vaginal pH in to the acidic&#xD;
      range. The healthiest vaginal environments are characterized by optimal acidic vaginal pH&#xD;
      levels, the presence of specific strains of lactobacilli. The secondary aim is to determine&#xD;
      if the continued use of Flourish will prevent recurrence of BV over a 6 month period. The&#xD;
      third aim is to determine what the vaginal microbiome community state type is after 6 months&#xD;
      of Flourish use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is designed to be a pilot/feasibility study. The study will compare the subjects&#xD;
      to a historical recurrence risk7. It will also assess the ability of subjects to comply with&#xD;
      the protocol.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Over a 2 year period, women in one academic OB/GYN clinic, who are patients of the PI and&#xD;
      sub-investigator, with a history of at least one prior episode of BV in the past year,&#xD;
      (confirmed via medical records) who currently have BV diagnosed via wet mount and vaginal pH,&#xD;
      will be approached during a clinical visit regarding their desire to participate in the&#xD;
      trial. If the subject chooses to participate after a thorough discussion of the risks and&#xD;
      benefits, she will sign the informed consent and be enrolled in the trial. Subjects will be&#xD;
      screened as per the providers' discretion for GC/ CH and trichomonas if it seems indicated&#xD;
      per sexual history and/ or has not been screened in the last 3 months. A total of 40 patients&#xD;
      will be enrolled; 20 in a shorter (12-week) preliminary study without microbiome analysis,&#xD;
      and 20 in a longer (6-month) study including microbiome analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once enrolled, each subject will be assigned a study number by the research nurse and receive&#xD;
      a packet of study materials from a study physician/clinician or the research nurse as well as&#xD;
      a &quot;Guide to Completing the BV Trial.&quot; This is a booklet containing detailed instructions for&#xD;
      each day of the study as well as a diary in which participants will record daily symptoms.&#xD;
      Demographic and past medical history information will also be collected at this visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the first day of enrollment, subjects will be screened for BV using the Affirm VPIII test,&#xD;
      the wet mount, vaginal pH and Nugent scoring. The Affirm test, wet mount, and vaginal pH will&#xD;
      be done in the office, the Nugent scoring will be done by Dr. Vonetta Edwards. Subjects will&#xD;
      also complete the vulvovaginal symptoms questionnaire (VSQ). If subjects present with either&#xD;
      BV or yeast infection, they will be treated with standard of care. After the initial visit,&#xD;
      all subjects will begin to use Balance every day, Restore every other day, and BiopHresh&#xD;
      every third day until the completion of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will return every 6 weeks for the remainder of the study to assess AE/SAE and test&#xD;
      for BV the same as at the screening visit. These visits and all other study related visits&#xD;
      will be with either the PI or sub-investigator. If the participant is found to have BV at one&#xD;
      of these visits they will be treated using standard of care and continue using the system as&#xD;
      directed. For subjects in the shorter study, subjects will be screened for BV/yeast, vaginal&#xD;
      pH, and Nugent scoring every 6 weeks. For those in the longer study, at 3 months and 6&#xD;
      months, the subject will be rescreened for BV using the Affirm VPIII test, vaginal pH and&#xD;
      Nugent scoring, and will complete the VSQ. At the 6 month visit, they will repeat all the&#xD;
      same procedures and also have a vaginal swab done for analysis by the Juno Vaginal Microbiome&#xD;
      Test. They will also be interviewed to obtain clinical experiences during the trial and will&#xD;
      turn in a journal of daily product use and symptoms completed throughout the study. This will&#xD;
      be obtained a member of the research team.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Monitoring of AE / SAE&#xD;
&#xD;
      The PI or sub-investigator will monitor AEs and SAEs. Sexual Health and Wellness Institute,&#xD;
      Sponsor of the study, will not interact directly with participants but will have a staff&#xD;
      member in the role of &quot;Physician Liaison&quot; available to assist physicians/clinicians at all&#xD;
      times for the duration of the study. To maintain confidentiality, the Physician Liaison is&#xD;
      the only Sponsor staff that will have access to patient information including patient names&#xD;
      and patient physician names and contact information.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Oversight&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study may be prematurely terminated if it is determined that an abnormal number of&#xD;
      participants experience SAEs directly associated with study materials, as verified and&#xD;
      reported by their physician/clinician. Study Sponsor (Sexual Health and Wellness Institute)&#xD;
      will be responsible for making this determination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Management&#xD;
&#xD;
      When all participants have completed the study with the participating clinicians,&#xD;
      participants' diaries and results of swab tests will be collected from participating&#xD;
      clinicians, and clinical experiences during the trial will be obtained by short in person&#xD;
      interviews by a member of the research team. Data from the participants' diaries and data&#xD;
      obtained from interview will be analyzed.&#xD;
