      Study group included 30 male diabetic patients , they performed circuit weight training&#xD;
      exercises for 12 weeks in addition to their medications. However, the control group included&#xD;
      10 patients received medical treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interleukin 6 and tumor necrosis factor alpha were measured before and after the study&#xD;
      duration for both groups.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The study group included 30 male diabetic patients who participated in circuit weight&#xD;
      training (CWT) program as following; 60 minutes training\day for 3 days per week for a period&#xD;
      of 12 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The training session started by a proper warm up for 5-10 min in the form of mild stretching&#xD;
      of the muscles of upper limb(pectorals,shoulder girdle muscles) and muscles of lower&#xD;
      limb(flexors, extensors, abductors and adductors of the hip and knee) ( to minimize the risk&#xD;
      of musculoskeletal injury). Then start the active phase of resisted exercises through using&#xD;
      free weights ( dumbbels for upper limb and sand bags for lower limb) The frequency and&#xD;
      intensity increased gradually as follows; Intensity of progress of CWT gradually increased&#xD;
      intensity by 2.5% of one repetition maximum every two weeks. Moderate resistance used in&#xD;
      which of 60-65% of 1RM in the first month then the intensity increased to 70-75% of 1RM in&#xD;
      the second month and finally the intensity of exercises increased to 75-80% of 1RM during the&#xD;
      third month. The sets of exercises intervened by 1 min rest in between each set of&#xD;
      repetitions. At last the session ends by 10 min of cooling down in the form of relaxation&#xD;
      exercises.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, the descriptive statistics (the mean, the standard deviation, maximum,&#xD;
      minimum, and range) will be calculated for all subjects in the study including IL6 and tumor&#xD;
      necrosis factor alpha variables.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Paired sample t-test will be used to compare the difference between before and after&#xD;
           treatment results of IL6 and tumor necrosis factor alpha in each group.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Paired T test to compare means of variables before and after training.&#xD;
