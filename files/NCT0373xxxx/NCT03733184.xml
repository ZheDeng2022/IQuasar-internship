  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cytoreduction surgery (CRS) followed by hyperthermic intra-operative peritoneal chemotherapy&#xD;
      (HIPEC) is a relatively new treatment for selected patients with peritoneal metastases of&#xD;
      colorectal origin (PMCR). Data from outside of trials suggest that CRS and HIPEC improves&#xD;
      survival compared with the current standard care (chemotherapy).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The big challenge is to do trials in this setting - as the intervention is complex, and there&#xD;
      are wide variations in the process and recording of outcomes. If trials can confirm the&#xD;
      findings from non-randomised studies there are an estimated 1000 to 2000 patients who may&#xD;
      benefit from this intervention in the UK each year. The aim of this study is to develop a&#xD;
      framework which can be used to undertake a randomised trial in patients with PMCR suitable&#xD;
      for CRS with or without HIPEC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will address this using the principles of the IDEAL (Idea, Development,&#xD;
      Evaluation, Assessment &amp; Long term study) framework. Here, a pre-trial feasibility study will&#xD;
      be performed between the two national peritoneal tumour treatment centres (Manchester and&#xD;
      Basingstoke).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is designed as such that it will take place over the following four stages:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stage 1. Comparing the treatment data from 100 operations from each of the two centres to&#xD;
      identify which of the key components of the intervention differ as well as testing for&#xD;
      differences in overall survival and recurrence free survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stage 2. Identifying sources of these differences by selecting up to 25 patients and&#xD;
      investigating the variation in the way surgeons score key aspects of the procedure&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stage 3. Development of a 'trial manual' with standardised definitions (to minimise any&#xD;
      differences)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stage 4. Test how well people follow the manual in practice. After this study is complete, it&#xD;
      will be possible to use the resulting trial manual to design future randomised trials to test&#xD;
      the most suitable clinical question.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The 2010 National Institute Centre for Excellence (NICE) IGP331 guidance recognised that&#xD;
      there is sufficient evidence (mainly from non-randomised comparative studies) that&#xD;
      cytoreduction surgery (CRS) followed by hyperthermic intraoperative peritoneal chemotherapy&#xD;
      (HIPEC), in selected patients with peritoneal metastases of colorectal origin (PMCR),&#xD;
      improves survival compared with systemic chemotherapy, current standard care. The guidance&#xD;
      recognised that this intervention is associated with considerable morbidity and mortality,&#xD;
      and accordingly, should be delivered with special arrangements for clinical governance,&#xD;
      consent and research, and include trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the UK, with 37,000 new colorectal cancers per annum, there are an estimated 1000 to 2000&#xD;
      patients who may benefit from this intervention. There are currently two treatment centres&#xD;
      (Manchester and Basingstoke), with additional new centres in Birmingham and Dublin starting&#xD;
      to roll out to meet this unmet need.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is only one published randomised trial in this field, which is now mainly historic&#xD;
      (2003). There are a small number of on-going trials, but these are small-scale and have&#xD;
      encountered various early problems, which can be summarised as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      (i) Wide variation in the treatment process, such that there has been between-arm imbalances&#xD;
      in key prognostic components (such as different case mix between arms); and&#xD;
&#xD;
      (ii) Wide variation of the reported treatment-related outcomes, such that it is unclear&#xD;
      whether results are generalizable to other centres.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are potentially two broad sources of this variability :&#xD;
&#xD;
      (i) Wide variation in clinical practice (ii) Poorly-reproducible methods of recording key&#xD;
      prognostic factors and outcomes&#xD;
&#xD;
      With the 'new wave' of emerging peritoneal tumour (PT) treatment centres, across the UK and&#xD;
      Ireland, there are opportunities to integrate phase III trials into this clinical network -&#xD;
      hence the timing of this study. In the past 12 months, there have been two meetings&#xD;
      (Basingstoke: April 2014; December 2014) outlining the frameworks on which to develop new PT&#xD;
      treatment centres, benchmarked against the established reference centres (Manchester and&#xD;
      Basingstoke). These meetings have strongly supported the parallel development of an&#xD;
      integrated PT research network.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The overarching aim of this study is to develop a robust and reproducible framework in which&#xD;
      to undertake a phase III trial in patients with PMCR suitable for CRS with or without HIPEC.&#xD;
      As CRS with HIPEC is a complex multi-component intervention, this agenda will be addressed&#xD;
      using the principles of the IDEAL (Idea, Development, Evaluation, Assessment &amp; Long term&#xD;
      study) framework.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stage 1 - Documenting between-centre variability For the first stage of the study, 200&#xD;
      eligible patients will be identified from prospective databases located at The Christie NHS&#xD;
      Foundation Trust and Hampshire Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust. In both cases, the data&#xD;
      extracted will be extracted from pre-existing databases and will be fully anonymised and at&#xD;
      no point will the research team see any patient identifiable information. The anonymised data&#xD;
      will be entered into a password protected Microsoft Excel Spreadsheet and sent using secure&#xD;
      NHS Mail account to the study co-ordinator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To investigate the between-centre variability the investigators will collect the following 19&#xD;
      core variables from 100 patients from each trust:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Age at time of operation&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Gender&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. WHO Performance Status&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Primary Vs Secondary Surgery&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Previous chemotherapy - If Yes - regimen, date and dose&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Nodal status at diagnosis and time or surgery&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. HIPEC regimen used&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. Primary Tumour Site&#xD;
&#xD;
        9. Blood transfusion requirements&#xD;
&#xD;
       10. Duration of operation&#xD;
&#xD;
       11. Peritoneal cancer index (PCI Score)&#xD;
&#xD;
       12. Cytoreduction completeness score&#xD;
&#xD;
       13. Type of Stoma&#xD;
&#xD;
       14. Highest complication grade&#xD;
&#xD;
       15. Peri-operative 30-day mortality&#xD;
&#xD;
       16. Date Last Seen&#xD;
&#xD;
       17. Date of Recurrence&#xD;
&#xD;
       18. Date of Initial Cytoreduction &amp; HIPEC&#xD;
&#xD;
       19. Date of Death (if applicable)&#xD;
&#xD;
      The data collected will then be analysed to establish if there are any significant&#xD;
      differences between the variables collected from each dataset. This will be primarily carried&#xD;
      out by the project statistician using STATA 14 software.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stage 2 - Identifying sources of variability The second stage will focus on reproducibility&#xD;
      and explore within and between-observer sources of variability. The procedure for this stage&#xD;
      will be partially dependant on the findings from the analysis at the end of stage 1. However,&#xD;
      the main focus will be on the assessment of intra-operative staging [namely Peritoneal Cancer&#xD;
      Index (PCI) score] - the best available instrument to stratify case-mix.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This stage of this study involves intra-operative photographs &amp; videos of intra-abdominal&#xD;
      tumour deposits in patients undergoing cytoreductive surgery for peritoneal metastases of&#xD;
      colorectal origin. The photographs &amp; videos will be taken in a systematic manner through 13&#xD;
      zones, using an internationally recognised grid, to derive patient-level scores of the burden&#xD;
      of tumour. The only risk to patients is approximately 15 minutes additional anaesthetic time.&#xD;
      The study requires 12 patients with complete recordings of all 13 zones - it is estimated&#xD;
      that up to 25 patients might need to be consented to derive a full complement of 12 sets.&#xD;
      These individuals will consent to partake in the study. The scores will be linked with other&#xD;
      patient-level clinical, pathological, and imaging data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient identification and recruitment process Patients will first be identified at the&#xD;
      weekly colorectal Multi-Disciplinary Team meeting by the colorectal consultant supervising&#xD;
      the study. The selected patients will later be approached by a core member of the clinical&#xD;
      team during their pre-op clinic visit to participate in the study. A patient information&#xD;
      sheet will be handed to them at least 24 hours before they are required to consent for the&#xD;
      study. This will contain all the details of the study and state that participation is&#xD;
      voluntary. There will also be details on how to withdraw from the study if so desired.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once all the required photographs &amp; videos have been collected, they will be imported into a&#xD;
      secure database and used to create an electronic survey for colorectal surgeons based within&#xD;
      the UK and internationally. Each surgeon will be sent a link to the survey where they will&#xD;
      first view a welcome page informing them of the process.&#xD;
&#xD;
      They will then proceed to view a set of videos taken at the start of an operation and then&#xD;
      asked to assess how they would score the PCI. Once they have entered a score between 0 and&#xD;
      39, they will then go on to view the photographs/videos taken after the cytoreduction has&#xD;
      been performed and assess how they would rate the CC score (CC0, CC1, CC2 or CC3). They will&#xD;
      then go on to do the same for the remaining procedures. The order in which the procedures&#xD;
      appear will be randomised in order to reduce any scoring bias. Once all required consultants&#xD;
      have completed the survey, the scores will be extracted and analysed for inter-observer&#xD;
      variation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stage 3 - Development of trial manual to standardise variation The next stage of the study is&#xD;
      to utilities the Delphi method to send out a modified version of the electronic questionnaire&#xD;
      over a number of rounds. The results from the initial questionnaire sent out in Stage 2 will&#xD;
      be analysed to establish which regions had agreement from less than 70% of the participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The survey will then be redistributed with a set of explanations &amp; definitions which will aim&#xD;
      to have participants converge on the same (&quot;correct&quot;) score. In addition, each answer will&#xD;
      display the percentage of participants who selected each score in the previous round. If&#xD;
      there continues to be regions with an agreement level of less than 70%, additional rounds&#xD;
      will take place with further definitions based on the feedback received until all regions&#xD;
      have reached the required level of agreement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stage 4 - Testing of the trial manual The final stage of the project will be to test the&#xD;
      fidelity of the trial manual assembled in stage 3. The workshop that takes place in stage 3&#xD;
      will involve a discussion of exactly which components of the trial manual are to be audited.&#xD;
      This audit will take place during the final three months of the project and will use the same&#xD;
      databases from the first stage of the study. In addition, the scoring of PCI and CC scores&#xD;
      will be re-assessed using the same images &amp; videos captured in stage 2 of the study to see if&#xD;
      there has been any standardisation in the scoring since the manual was distributed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The results from this audit will be sent to the colorectal surgery teams at all involved&#xD;
      centres and if required, will highlight any areas of the trial manual that do not appear to&#xD;
      be adhered to.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of stage 1, 2 and 3 the data collected will be analysed by the project&#xD;
      statistician. STATA 14 software will be used to compare baseline and matched characteristics&#xD;
      between patients treated at The Christie NHS FT and Hampshire Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust.&#xD;
      This will be done by using standard tests for continuous variables (Kruskal-Wallis and&#xD;
      Wilcoxon signed-rank tests, respectively) and categorical variables (χ² and McNemar tests,&#xD;
      respectively).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The results from the staff questionnaire will also be used to investigate between and&#xD;
      within-observer variability.&#xD;
