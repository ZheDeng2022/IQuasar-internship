      This is a prospective, multicenter, observational, single-blinded controlled study. Dynamic&#xD;
      monitoring of patients with stage II-III colorectal cancer was performed using the previously&#xD;
      established colorectal tumor-specific plasma ctDNA methylation markers (Multigene methylation&#xD;
      detection). Dynamic monitoring of plasma ctDNA methylation before and after treatment and at&#xD;
      regular follow-up in patients with colorectal cancer after radical resection of stage II-III&#xD;
      colorectal cancer, to explore the predictive effect of postoperative plasma ctDNA methylation&#xD;
      on postoperative recurrence and whether dynamic monitoring of postoperative ctDNA methylation&#xD;
      could be earlier than imaging examination to indicate tumor recurrence.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      At present, the main treatment of stage II-III CRC (CRC) is surgical resection. CRC patients&#xD;
      after radical surgery have good overall survival. However, there are still a large number of&#xD;
      patients with postoperative recurrence. The postoperative recurrence rate of stage II CRC&#xD;
      patients is 20-30%, and that of stage III CRC patients is 50-60%. Currently, there is no&#xD;
      effective measures to predict whether patients suffer postoperative relapse. Patients can&#xD;
      only periodically visit doctors in the hope of timely treatment in case of recurrence.&#xD;
      Current clinical monitoring methods mainly include imaging detection and tumor markers&#xD;
      detection. However, long-term monitoring may affect patients' quality of life and increase&#xD;
      patients' economic burden. Therefore, biomarkers that can predict the prognosis of patients&#xD;
      and screen out those who need intensive follow up are urgently warranted. At present, imaging&#xD;
      is the mainly used approach to monitor tumor recurrence. Quantitative determination of ctDNA&#xD;
      methylation in plasma may find tumor recurrence trend before imaging detection, indicating&#xD;
      that quantitative determination of ctDNA methylation in plasma is a more sensitive monitoring&#xD;
      approach than traditional imaging detection. Can plasma ctDNA methylation be a new recurrence&#xD;
      monitoring technique and prognostic prediction method of stage II-III CRC in clinical&#xD;
      practice? In this study, we aimed to monitor the dynamic level of plasma ctDNA methylation&#xD;
      after surgery in patients with stage II-III CRC, and to explore the advantages of plasma&#xD;
      ctDNA methylation detection over traditional CRC in recurrence monitoring and prognosis&#xD;
      prediction. This is a prospective, multicenter, observational, single-blinded controlled&#xD;
      study. Dynamic monitoring of patients with stage II-III CRC was performed using the&#xD;
      previously established colorectal tumor-specific plasma ctDNA methylation markers. Dynamic&#xD;
      monitoring of plasma ctDNA methylation before and after treatment and at regular follow-up in&#xD;
      patients with CRC after radical resection of stage II-III CRC, to explore the predictive&#xD;
      effect of postoperative plasma ctDNA methylation on postoperative recurrence and whether&#xD;
      dynamic monitoring of postoperative ctDNA methylation could be earlier than imaging&#xD;
      examination to indicate tumor recurrence.&#xD;
