    <textblock>
      The accuracy of standard two dimension digital mammography (2DDM) in breast cancer screening&#xD;
      is limited because of superimposition of normal breast structures onto a two dimensional&#xD;
      image. Mammography signs of breast cancer may be obscured, resulting in delay in the&#xD;
      diagnosis of breast cancer. Conversely, superimposition of normal tissues may produce&#xD;
      features on mammography which are suspicious for cancer and lead to recall for further tests.&#xD;
      Digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT) is a new x ray mammography technique which provides three&#xD;
      dimensional information to the film reader, overcoming many of the interpretation problems&#xD;
      due to tissue superimposition. Studies of DBT + 2DDM in screening have shown increased cancer&#xD;
      detection rates and lower false positive recall rates. There may be increased costs related&#xD;
      to the technology and reading times.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to measure the impact and cost effectiveness of DBT + 2DDM in&#xD;
      routine screening compared to standard 2DDM.100,000 women wil be recruited using NHS BSP&#xD;
      screening sites. At each site, through a clinic randomization process, half of the&#xD;
      participants will undergo standard screening with 2DDM (the control group) and half will&#xD;
      undergo screening using DBT+2DDM.&#xD;

      The accuracy of two view digital x-ray mammography (2DDM), the standard test for breast&#xD;
      cancer screening, is limited because of the effect of superimposition of normal breast&#xD;
      structures onto a two dimensional image. The mammography signs of breast cancer may be&#xD;
      obscured, particularly in women with dense fibro glandular breast tissue, resulting in delay&#xD;
      in diagnosis of cancer. National interval cancer data shows that up to 4000 women per annum&#xD;
      (2.88 per 1000 screened) are diagnosed with breast cancer in the interval between screens.&#xD;
      Conversely, superimposition of normal tissues may produce features on mammography which are&#xD;
      suspicious for cancer and lead to unnecessary recall for further diagnostic tests. National&#xD;
      screening data for 2012/2013 show that of 2.3 million women screened, 79000 (3.4%) without&#xD;
      breast cancer were recalled to specialist diagnostic assessment clinics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DBT is an x-ray mammography technique which involves acquiring multiple low dose projections&#xD;
      over a limited angular range (less than 50 degrees). These projection images are&#xD;
      reconstructed into a set of images consisting of parallel planes, typically 1mm apart&#xD;
      throughout the breast. Three dimensional information is provided for the reader, overcoming&#xD;
      many of the interpretation problems associated with 2DDM. Several studies have demonstrated&#xD;
      improvement in the accuracy of DBT in the diagnostic setting. Published data from studies of&#xD;
      DBT combined with 2DDM in screening have demonstrated increased rates of invasive cancer&#xD;
      detection, cancers detected at a smaller size and decreased false positive recall rates.&#xD;
      However, there may be increased costs associated with the technology, image data storage and&#xD;
      longer reading time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As a result of recent technical developments, a two dimensional mammography image can be&#xD;
      produced by processing the tomosynthesis image data. Synthetic 2D (S2D) trial data show that&#xD;
      the accuracy of DBT + S2D may be the same as that achieved with DBT + 2DDM.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary aim of this trial is to assess the impact of the addition of DBT to 2DDM in&#xD;
      routine breast cancer screening compared to 2D mammography. 100 000 women will be recruited&#xD;
      over twelve months using NHS screening sites with DBT ready mammography equipment. At each&#xD;
      site, through a clinic randomisation process, half the trial participants will undergo&#xD;
      standard 2DDM (the control group) and half will undergo 2DDM and DBT (the study group).&#xD;
      Synthetic 2D images will be produced for all women in the intervention group. A secondary&#xD;
      objective of the trial is to compare the accuracy of DBT + 2DDM with DBT + S2D. For each&#xD;
      woman in the intervention group, one reader will view DBT + 2DDM, and the other reader will&#xD;
      view DBT + S2D. This will enable a non-inferiority test to be applied to DBT + S2D vs DBT +&#xD;
      2DDM.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators plan to use DBT in addition to 2DDM in the intervention group because:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Most previous trials demonstrated increased sensitivity and specificity by using DBT in&#xD;
           combination with 2D imaging rather than as a replacement.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  By using both 2D and DBT in the study group, the investigators will be able to review&#xD;
           the display of the same cancer in the two techniques.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One concern about using DBT in conjunction with 2D imaging is the increase in radiation dose.&#xD;
      The investigators conservatively estimate the mean glandular radiation dose of 4mGy in the&#xD;
      control group and 9mGy in the study group. In other words, DBT imaging requires slightly more&#xD;
      than double the dose of 2D imaging. A recent study of Yaffe &amp; Mainprize 2011 has shown that&#xD;
      benefits of screening with mammography greatly exceed the detriment due to the radiation.&#xD;
      Using similar calculations the investigators estimate that the ratio of lives saved and lost&#xD;
      due to radiation in the 2DDM screening arm will be in the range 150-300 to 1. The higher dose&#xD;
      in the study group is expected to lead to greater benefit and greater detriment. In order for&#xD;
      the extra benefit to exceed the extra detriment of using DBT in the study group there will&#xD;
      need to be a very small (0.45% to 0.9%) increase in lives saved. In practice the&#xD;
      investigators expect a larger benefit that this.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Health need: the effectiveness of 2DDM in detection of invasive breast cancer has&#xD;
           improved over the last twenty years as demonstrated by a decrease in interval cancer&#xD;
           rates (cancers occurring between routine three yearly screens). This improvement is a&#xD;
           result of the introduction of two view mammography, digital mammography and improvements&#xD;
           in film reading performance. However, the most recent published interval cancer rates of&#xD;
           2.85 per 1000 women screened demonstrates the limited sensitivity of 2DDM in cancer&#xD;
           detection. Published data from studies of DBT and 2DDM in screening in Europe and North&#xD;
           America demonstrate an increased invasive cancer detection rate of 40-48% compared to&#xD;
           2DDM alone. Data from this study will demonstrate whether such an improvement in&#xD;
           sensitivity is achievable in the NHSBSP, whether cancers can be detected at a smaller&#xD;
           size, and prognostic features of screen detected and interval cancers will be used to&#xD;
           model whether there would be a greater reduction in breast cancer mortality from&#xD;
           screening with 2DDM plus DBT compared to 2D alone. Data will also demonstrate the effect&#xD;
           on false positive recalls in the NHSBSP. Published results show that this may be&#xD;
           decreased by 15-20% with the use of DBT.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Economic analysis: The study will demonstrate whether replacing standard 2DDM with DBT&#xD;
           (and S2D) represents an efficient use of NHS resources, either because DBT reduces&#xD;
           overall cost or because the additional health benefits of greater sensitivity and&#xD;
           specificity justify the additional cost.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Sustained interest: DBT may have a major impact on the effectiveness and the cost of&#xD;
           screening. Data from this study will help decide the optimum strategy for using DBT in&#xD;
           routine screening in the NHS.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Development of research area: results from this study will help identify which groups of&#xD;
           women will benefit from screening with DBT.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Scientific knowledge: this study will advance our understanding of the effect of DBT on&#xD;
           the characteristics of screen detected cancers, whether more biologically significant&#xD;
           cancers are found when smaller and at an earlier stage, and whether more low grade&#xD;
           cancers are diagnosed, increasing the problem of over diagnosis.&#xD;
