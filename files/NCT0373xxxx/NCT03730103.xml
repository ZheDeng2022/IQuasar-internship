    <textblock>
      This is a prospective cohort study evaluating safety, cost and patient satisfaction with SDD&#xD;
      for patients undergoing minimally invasive sacrocolpopexy for pelvic organ prolapse. A&#xD;
      prospectively collected, historical control group who underwent the same surgical procedure&#xD;
      will be utilized to compare these outcomes when applicable. SDD will be facilitated in part&#xD;
      by a utilizing novel patient education video created for this study and implementing an ERAS&#xD;
      pathway. All patients meeting eligibility criteria will be approached for study&#xD;
      participation. Outcomes will be assessed on POD 0/1 and at the routine post-operative follow&#xD;
      up visit, generally at 6 weeks after surgery.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS) pathways play a critical role in the delivery of&#xD;
      high-quality surgical care. These protocols incorporate multiple perioperative patient&#xD;
      interventions including preemptive analgesia, measures to reduce postoperative nausea and&#xD;
      emesis, fluid balance aimed at euvolemia, and both early ambulation and oral intake. ERAS&#xD;
      pathways are significant because they have been shown to shorten recovery, decrease hospital&#xD;
      stay, reduce complications/nosocomial infections, and conserve resources.1-20 Same-day&#xD;
      discharge (SDD) is a central aspect of enhanced recovery pathways.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SDD and ERAS protocols are part of a new initiative within the Women's Health Institute, and&#xD;
      their application for gynecologic surgery is of increasing interest across the country.1-19&#xD;
      To date, the focus of studies has largely been on laparoscopic and robotic hysterectomy in&#xD;
      the benign and gynecologic oncology literature. Studies have consistently demonstrated both&#xD;
      feasibility and safety of SDD after laparoscopic and robotic hysterectomy, with no&#xD;
      significant increase in complications or readmissions as compared to discharge on&#xD;
      postoperative day (POD) 1. In fact, a recent systematic review by Korsholm et al of 15&#xD;
      observational studies with nearly 12,000 patients revealed SDD is feasible, at a rate of&#xD;
      nearly 80%, when patients are properly selected and careful surgical planning is performed.3&#xD;
      Studies have also demonstrated high patient satisfaction10,12 and less cost18 with SDD after&#xD;
      minimally invasive hysterectomy. SDD has been applied in other minimally invasive gynecologic&#xD;
      procedures, such as minimally invasive myomectomy, with low readmission rates (0.6% within 48&#xD;
      hours, 1.4% over 3 months).20&#xD;
&#xD;
      ERAS pathways can have an important role in other areas of gynecologic surgery. In the field&#xD;
      of urogynecology, quality of life reconstructive surgery is often performed to address&#xD;
      symptoms of pelvic organ prolapse, urinary incontinence, and/or fecal incontinence. A&#xD;
      prospective study by Kalogera et al evaluated the impact of an ERAS pathway for patients&#xD;
      undergoing vaginal reconstructive surgeries for pelvic organ prolapse versus historical&#xD;
      controls.21 In this cohort, patient satisfaction with perioperative care was high, mean&#xD;
      duration of hospital stay was significantly reduced, and there were no differences in 30 day&#xD;
      outcomes. In a case series by Zakaria and Levy, an ERAS pathway was utilized after vaginal&#xD;
      hysterectomy, which permitted SDD in 96% of patients.19 Notably, only 5 of the 1071 patients&#xD;
      required readmission or emergency room evaluation within 30 days of surgery. Taken together,&#xD;
      these studies provide support for the application of ERAS pathways in urogynecology, where&#xD;
      well-selected surgical candidates are undergoing surgeries appropriate for SDD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Yet, to date, only one research study has investigated the role of SDD after minimally&#xD;
      invasive sacrocolpopexy. A sacrocolpopexy is a surgery for pelvic organ prolapse in which a&#xD;
      bridging piece of mesh is utilized to suspend the vaginal cuff to the anterior longitudinal&#xD;
      ligament overlying the sacral promontory. This is an extensively studied and highly effective&#xD;
      surgical technique to correct pelvic organ prolapse and is a mainstay in the field of&#xD;
      urogynecology. A study by Faucheron et al evaluated SDD for robotic and laparoscopic ventral&#xD;
      rectopexy, a similar mesh-augmented procedure that is performed for rectal prolapse, and&#xD;
      concluded that SDD is feasible and safe.22 A preliminary study by Lloyd et al performed at&#xD;
      the Cleveland Clinic within the Female Urology division investigated SDD after minimally&#xD;
      invasive sacrocolpopexy (article in press). In this study, SDD was achieved in 10 of 12&#xD;
      patients (83.3%). The two patients who did not have SDD were due to case completion after&#xD;
      6PM, a preset case completion requirement. Outcomes were also retrospectively compared&#xD;
      between patients who underwent SDD (N= 10) and patients who stayed overnight (N=30). Only one&#xD;
      patient had an emergency department visit on POD 20, due to an unrelated mechanical fall.&#xD;
      Importantly, there were no major complications in either group requiring procedural&#xD;
      interventions, new prescriptions, or additional interventions. Recently, a study by Kisby et&#xD;
      al was published examining SDD after robotic-assisted sacrocolpopexy. In this retrospective&#xD;
      study, 80 women underwent SDD compared to 192 who were discharged on &gt;/=POD 1.23 This study&#xD;
      found no difference in unplanned provider visits, emergency department visits or readmissions&#xD;
      between the groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that an ERAS protocol utilizing SDD for minimally invasive&#xD;
      sacrocolpopexy is as safe as those that utilize discharge on POD 1 while incurring less total&#xD;
      procedure-related costs and being acceptable as a post-op management plan for patients. The&#xD;
      objective of this study is to provide data which are necessary to widely implement SDD after&#xD;
      a minimally invasive sacrocolpopexy. The results of this research will have a significant&#xD;
      impact on increasing patient satisfaction, minimizing resource utilization, and improving&#xD;
      clinical practice patterns in the field of urogynecology, both for this procedure and&#xD;
      potentially other surgeries within our subspecialty.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aims Aim 1. To compare the incidence of adverse events in patients following a SDD&#xD;
      protocol for minimally invasive sacrocolpopexy compared to those patients discharged on POD&#xD;
      1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that there is no difference in the incidence of adverse events&#xD;
      between SDD compared to discharge on POD 1 after minimally invasive sacrocolpopexy. Using the&#xD;
      Epic electronic medical record (EMR), the investigators will evaluate 1) the number of&#xD;
      unscheduled office visits, patient-initiated calls for a surgery-related complication,&#xD;
      emergency department visits, and readmissions/reoperations of patients who had a SDD protocol&#xD;
      and 2) the severity of any adverse events using the Clavien Dindo Scale. The investigators&#xD;
      will utilize patient phone calls to inquire about any of the aforementioned events outside of&#xD;
      our institution. The investigators will compare incidence of postoperative adverse events&#xD;
      between patients undergoing SDD versus a historical control group who were discharged on POD&#xD;
      1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2. To compare the total procedure-related costs associated with SDD compared to discharge&#xD;
      on POD 1 for minimally invasive sacrocolpopexy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that the total costs associated with SDD following minimally&#xD;
      invasive sacrocolpopexy is less than the same procedure with discharge on POD 1. The&#xD;
      investigators will utilize data from the billing function of Epic EMR to compare total&#xD;
      procedure-related costs for each approach to minimally invasive sacrocolpopexy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 3. To determine patient satisfaction with SDD after minimally invasive sacrocolpopexy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that patients will be satisfied with SDD after minimally&#xD;
      invasive sacrocolpopexy. The investigators plan to address this aim using a series of&#xD;
      validated measures.&#xD;
