    <textblock>
      Non-pharmacological interventional pilot study on the effect of prismatic glasses for the&#xD;
      improvement of Pisa syndrome in Parkinson's disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study involves 40 patients, of whom 20 receive active treatment and 20 slow placebo. At&#xD;
      the end of the study, all patients receive corrective lenses in compassionate use if the&#xD;
      study yields positive results.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In previous cases of patients with Parkinson's disease and Pisa Syndrome, the investigators&#xD;
      found a slight improvement in the dystonia of the trunk after the application of prismatic&#xD;
      lenses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The current study provides the involvement of 40 patients with Parkinson's disease, of which&#xD;
      twenty treated with permanent prismatic optical correction, and twenty treated with neutral&#xD;
      optical correction or with the only optical correction of the refractive basic defects&#xD;
      (placebo).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The protocol provides the collection of these data:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Personal data (date of birth, sex, marital status, profession)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  General history (weight, height, non-neurological and neurological concomitant&#xD;
           pathologies, medical conditions that may be associated or predisposing patients to PS,&#xD;
           non-antiparkinsonian therapy in progress)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Specific history for PD (year from the first diagnosis of PD, year of appearance of the&#xD;
           first motor symptoms of PD, type and distribution of motor symptoms at the onset)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pharmacological history of PD (year of initiation of the first treatment for PD, which&#xD;
           drugs (s), antiparkinsonian therapy in progress)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Neurological Evaluation in ON: UPDRS I, II, III and IV (III: also items-20-26 right and&#xD;
           left side), Hoehn-Yahr stage;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Specific history for PS;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Detection of some information about the patients' perception of having the torso tilted&#xD;
           sideways, direction of inclination, how long it is present, how long it is manifested,&#xD;
           conditions in which this inclination is present (standing, sitting, etc.) )&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Presence of low back pain and pain intensity measured with the Visual Analogue Scale&#xD;
           (VAS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical and kinematic evaluation of PS:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The amount of dystonia measured in degrees with the patient positioned against the wall&#xD;
           against a dedicated protractor. This measurement is photographed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Static and dynamic kinematic evaluation (gait analysis) according to the following&#xD;
           protocol: 30 seconds stationary in orthostatic position, shoulders to the cameras, about&#xD;
           5 steps forward, stationary in orthostatic position while fixing visual stimulation&#xD;
           points placed on the wall, 30 second stationary in an orthostatic position after having&#xD;
           covered a section of the corridor in front of the kinematic evaluation room.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Orthoptic evaluation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      complete orthoptic evaluation and prescription of personalized prismatic lenses, randomizing&#xD;
      the patient on active or slow-moving placebo lenses with respect to the other experimenters&#xD;
      and the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Flowchart of visits:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening: the neurologist selects the patient according to the eligibility criteria&#xD;
      indicated above and verifies the patient's willingness to participate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization: the patient undergoes clinical and kinematics evaluation of the PS, orthoptic&#xD;
      examination and randomization on active lenses and placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study times:&#xD;
&#xD;
      T0: randomization and prescription of lenses T1: check after 1 month from the use of lenses&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients are recruited at the Parkinson's Center of the IRCCS Neuromed.&#xD;
