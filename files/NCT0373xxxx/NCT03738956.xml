      Title Efficacy and Safety of Tofacitinib in the Treatment of NSAID-Refractory Axial&#xD;
      Spondyloarthritis: A Clinical Trial&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Axial spondyloarthritis (axSpA) is a chronic systemic inflammatory rheumatic disease&#xD;
      affecting mainly sacroiliac joints and spine. There are limited options for treatment.&#xD;
      Initial treatments are patient's education, regular physical exercise and nonsteroidal&#xD;
      antiinflammatory drugs(NSAID). If the patients do not respond to at least two NSAIDs in full&#xD;
      dosages for at least one month then it is called NSAID refractory axSpA. In these cases&#xD;
      biologics like-tumor necrosis factor α blockers are the options for treatment. Tofacitinib is&#xD;
      a new drug has been proven to be effective for treatment of rheumatoid arthritis , psoriasis&#xD;
      , inflammatory bowel disease and supposed to be effective in spondyloarthritis. This study is&#xD;
      aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of tofacitinib in NSAID refractory ax SpA with a view&#xD;
      to find a safe, effective and affordable treatment modality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Method:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This open label uncontrolled clinical trial with tofacitinib will be conducted in NSAID&#xD;
      refractory axSpA (age &gt;18 years) patients. Study participants will be enrolled after having&#xD;
      informed written consent from the outpatient department of Rheumatology, Bangabandhu sheikh&#xD;
      mujib medical university. Assessment of Spondyloarthritis International Society (ASAS)&#xD;
      criteria will be followed for diagnosis of ax SpA. Patients failing a trial of 2 different&#xD;
      NSAID each for at least 2 weeks with optimum dosage without response or with partial response&#xD;
      and Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Index (BASDAI) score of ≥4 (range, 0-10) or&#xD;
      Ankylosing spondylitis disease activity score-C reactive protein(ASDAS-CRP)&gt;2.1 will be&#xD;
      considered as primary entry criteria for this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline evaluation will include Bath AS Disease Activity Index (BASDAI), Functional Index&#xD;
      (BASFI) , Ankylosing spondylitis disease activity score-C reactive protein(ASDASCRP) and&#xD;
      Ankylosing spondylitis disease activity score-erythrocyte sedimentation rate(ASDAS-ESR).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Laboratory tests like CBC, ESR, CRP, SGPT, Serum creatinine and X-ray pelvis A/P view or&#xD;
      X-ray both SI joints modified Ferguson veiw (to see both SI and hip joints ), HLA-B27(if&#xD;
      needed), CXR P/A view and MT test or Interferon Gamma Release Assay(IGRA) will be done.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After considering inclusion and exclusion criteria eligible patients will be included for&#xD;
      this study. All patients will be put on 5mg tofacitinib BD. NSAID and adjuvant analgesics&#xD;
      will be used if needed. Follow up will be done at 4th, 12th and 24th week. Response to&#xD;
      treatment will be evaluated by assessement of spondyloarthritis society (ASAS) response&#xD;
      criteria. More than 20% improvements from baseline will consider as primary response at the&#xD;
      end of 12th week. Those patients who will not achieve ASAS20 response at 12th week, will be&#xD;
      given 10 mg tofacitinib BD. Efficacy will be assessed at the end of 24th week by ASAS20,&#xD;
      ASAS50, ASAS70, ASDAS-ESR, ASDAS-CRP, BASDAI, Bath ankylosing spondylitis functional&#xD;
      index(BASFI). Adverse effects will be assesed by history, Physical examinations and&#xD;
      investigations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The entire study subjects will be informed about the nature, purpose and implication of the&#xD;
      study as well as whole spectrum of benefits and risk of the study. Ethical clearance will be&#xD;
      taken from the IRB of BSMMU.&#xD;

      INTRODUCTION Spondyloarthritis (SpA) is one of the most prevalent forms of chronic&#xD;
      inflammatory arthritis. It affects approximately 0.01-2.5% in the World wide. Estimated&#xD;
      prevalence of SpA in India is between 0.1 to 0.2% and prevalence in Bangladesh is about 1.2%&#xD;
      .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Janus kinase (JAK) is a family of intracellular, nonreceptor tyrosine kinase that transduce&#xD;
      cytokine-mediated signals via theJAK-signal transduction and activation of transcriptors(&#xD;
      JAK-STAT) pathway. The JAK-STAT signaling pathway transmits information from extracellular&#xD;
      chemical signals to the nucleus resulting in DNA transcription and expression of genes&#xD;
      involved in immunity, proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis and oncogenesis .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tofacitinib acts by inhibiting JAK-STAT pathway particularly JAK1 and/JAK3 of multilineage&#xD;
      cells thereby inhibiting lymphocytes. It inhibits interleukin IL-17, IL-21, IL-23 and&#xD;
      interferon IFN-γ productions by CD4 T cells acts on dendritic cells(DCs) and suppressed&#xD;
      inflammatory cytokine productions and expression of costimulatory molecules, also supprressed&#xD;
      T cell stimulatory capacity of DCs. These indicate that wide range of biological effects of&#xD;
      tofacitinib that directly and indirectly affect cytokine pathway thereby modulate immunue&#xD;
      response and reduce inflammations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Axial SpA patients treated with tofacitinib experienced clinically meaningful reductions in&#xD;
      axial MRI inflammations and thereby an increased clinical response rates. A 16-week, phase&#xD;
      II, randomized trial on AS patients with tofacitinib showed 80.8 % patients achieved ASAS 20&#xD;
      response .&#xD;
&#xD;
      As the therapeutic options of NSAID refractory axial SpA are limited, we want to assess the&#xD;
      efficacy of tofacitinib in refractory axial SpA. In our country there are no studies of&#xD;
      tofacitinib on axial spondyloarthritis. In Bangladesh, tofacitinib is cheaper than anti TNF&#xD;
      biologics so it will reduce the treatment cost.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rationale of the Study There are limited options for treating NSAID refractory axial SpA.&#xD;
      Therefore, choosing the appropriate therapeutic options, efficacy, long term safety, and&#xD;
      tolerability should be considered. Recently, biological agents having anti tumor necrosis&#xD;
      factor-α (TNF-α) activity are now considered as 1st line treatment for refractory axial SpA.&#xD;
      But these drugs are costly difficult to afford by most of the people of our country and there&#xD;
      is also increase risk of activation of the latent tuberculosis, other adverse effects like&#xD;
      malignancies, hematological disorders and various infections are still a problem. n our&#xD;
      country this drug is less costly affordable by many people and as it is available as tablet&#xD;
      form so drug compliance will be better than biological drugs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Hypothesis&#xD;
&#xD;
      Null hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tofacitinib is not effective in NSAID refractory axial SpA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Alternative hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tofacitinib is effective in the treatment of NSAID refractory axial SpA. Tofacitinib is safe&#xD;
      in the treatment of NSAID refractory axial SpA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives Primary Objective To assess the efficacy and safety of tofacitinib in the&#xD;
      treatment of NSAID refractory axial SpA&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives To compare the efficacy and safety of 10 mg and 20 mg tofacitinib in the&#xD;
      treatment of NSAID refractory axial SpA.&#xD;

&#xD;
      Quality assurance strategy This will be uncontrolled clinical trial. Extensive literature&#xD;
      search was done. Direct supervision by guide and co-guides will be done. Investigator will be&#xD;
      sufficiently trained. Patient will purchase the drugs from pharmacy execpt tofacitinib which&#xD;
      will provide free of cost and all of these drugs will be checked by the investigator. Monthly&#xD;
      pill count will be done to ensure drug adherence. Patients will be educated properly not to&#xD;
      take other medications that interact with tofacitinib(Rifampicin,ketoconazole) during the&#xD;
      whole study period .During his/her follow up visit every time it will be ensured that he/she&#xD;
      is not taking any other medication except those suggested by us. To prevent loss of follow&#xD;
      up, telephone number of patient and caregiver will be collected, permanent and present&#xD;
      address will be noted meticulously. They will advise to come for a follow up visit monthly.&#xD;
      If any patient will miss it then he/she will be contacted over telephone to know their where&#xD;
      about. If they are not available by telephone then a letter will be send to their present and&#xD;
      permanent address. If they failed to reply and if they live nearby then I myself or a&#xD;
      volunteer will be send to his/ her resident. Review of the study status will be done every&#xD;
      fortnightly by the investigator with Guide. 10% data will be checked randomly by the guide.&#xD;
      It will be an unbiased study. After collection, all data will be checked for inadequacy,&#xD;
      irrelevancy and inconsistency. Irrelevant and inconsistent data will be discarded.&#xD;
