      standardized rehabilitative therapy in patients with acute stroke is associated with&#xD;
&#xD;
      a) patient relevant improvements of physical function b) improvement in patient-self assessed&#xD;
      general health aspects, pain, mood, anxiety, fatigue and social participation c) long-term&#xD;
      sustainability of a patient-relevant improvement of motor function d) improvement of&#xD;
      selective hand and wrist movement e) a higher rate of patients walking independently of the&#xD;
      help of another person.&#xD;
&#xD;
      f) less severe impairment g) a higher level of activity of daily living h) improvements of&#xD;
      quality of life (i) better cognitive performance (j) no signals of harms (i.e. indications&#xD;

    <measure>Between-group difference of scores in the Fugl-Meyer-Motor Assessment (FMMA)</measure>
    <time_frame>Assessed 3 months +/- 14 days after randomization</time_frame>
    <description>FMMA is a stroke-specific impairment index designed to assess motor recovery. Scale items are scored on the basis of ability to complete the item using a 3-point ordinal scale (0=cannot perform; 1=performs partially and 2= performs fully). FMMA total scores range from 0 (no movements) to 100 (normal movements) with 66 points for movements of the upper limbs (FMMA-UE) and 34 for those of the lower limbs (FMMA-LE). A difference of 5.25 points for the upper extremity and 6 points for the lower extremity part of the score are described as minimal clinically important difference. For this study, based on these data, 6 points difference are considered a patient-relevant difference between both treatment groups for the primary endpoint.</description>

    <measure>Change in NIH-Stroke Scale score (NIHSS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Assessed at Day 0 (Randomization), 5 weeks after randomization, 3 months +/- 14 days after randomization, 6 months +/- 20 days after randomization and 12 months +/- 30 days after randomization</time_frame>
    <description>To objectively quantify the impairment caused by a stroke. NIHSS is composed of 11 items, each of which scores a specific ability between a 0 and 4. For each item, a score of 0 typically indicates normal function in that specific ability, while a higher score is indicative of some level of impairment. The individual scores from each item are summed in order to calculate a patient's total NIHSS score. The maximum possible score is 42, with the minimum score being a 0.</description>

    <description>Scale for measuring the degree of disability or dependence in the daily activities of people who have suffered a stroke or other causes of neurological disability. The scale runs from 0-6, running from perfect health without symptoms to death.&#xD;
0 - No symptoms.&#xD;
- No significant disability. Able to carry out all usual activities, despite some symptoms.&#xD;
- Slight disability. Able to look after own affairs without assistance, but unable to carry out all previous activities.&#xD;
- Moderate disability. Requires some help, but able to walk unassisted.&#xD;
- Moderately severe disability. Unable to attend to own bodily needs without assistance, and unable to walk unassisted.&#xD;
- Severe disability. Requires constant nursing care and attention, bedridden, incontinent.&#xD;
- Dead.</description>
