      This is an open label, single arm, non-randomized, multi-site, phase 2 clinical trial of&#xD;
      neoadjuvant pembrolizumab in combination with gemcitabine-cisplatin for 2 cycles,followed by&#xD;
      concurrent pembrolizumab-cisplain-radiation, and then maintainence pembrolizumab monotherpy&#xD;
      given every 3 weeks for a total treatment duration of 12 months, in previously untreated&#xD;
      stage IVA ( UICC 8 th Edition ) nasopharyngeal cancer(NPC).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Nasopharyngeal cancer (NPC) is a predominantly Asian disease, with approximately 80% of the&#xD;
      world's 86000 cases occurring in Asian countries (12). With advances in radiation technology&#xD;
      such as intensity modulation radiotherapy (IMRT), local and nodal control exceeds 85-90% in&#xD;
      most reported series. Distant metastasis remains the main mode of failure, particularly in&#xD;
      locally advanced NPC. As an example, in a study by Pan et al (13), 5 years local and nodal&#xD;
      control of 86% and 89% was achieved with concurrent chemo-IMRT respectively, but distant&#xD;
      failure free survival of 77% and 72% was reported for patients with T4 and N3 disease&#xD;
      respectively (AJCC 8th edition).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Current strategies to reduce distant metastasis, including the use of adjuvant chemotherapy&#xD;
      have been inconclusive. One major disadvantage of adjuvant chemotherapy following the&#xD;
      completion of chemoradiation is that approximately half of patients are unable to complete&#xD;
      the full 3 cycles of adjuvant chemotherapy, due to treatment related toxicities. The use of&#xD;
      induction chemotherapy has two potential benefits: the first is to downsize the tumour,&#xD;
      making radiotherapy more tolerable; the second, it allows for patients to be able to complete&#xD;
      the chemotherapy before the onset of chemoradiation associated toxicities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are at least two studies now supporting the use of induction chemotherapy. A recent&#xD;
      publication by Ma et al (14), showed the addition of induction docetaxel, cisplatin and&#xD;
      fluorouracil prior to concurrent chemoradiation resulted in 8% improvement (80% vs 72%) in&#xD;
      3-year failure-free survival. Similarly, Cao et al showed that 2 cycles of cisplatin and&#xD;
      fluorouracil prior to chemoradiation improved the 3 years disease free survival in patients&#xD;
      (15).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Gemcitabine and cisplatin has been shown to be more effective than 5-FU plus cisplatin as&#xD;
      first-line treatment for recurrent or metastatic nasopharyngeal carcinoma (16). There are&#xD;
      currently no studies looking at the addition of anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibody such as&#xD;
      pembrolizumab either in the in the induction or maintenance setting. Hence, we are proposing&#xD;
      the use of pembrolizumab in combination with 2 cycles of gemcitabine and cisplatin&#xD;
      chemotherapy followed by concurrent chemoradiation. Following completion of chemoradiation,&#xD;
      patients will receive maintenance pembrolizumab for total treatment duration of one year. The&#xD;
      main objective of this Phase II study is to test the safety, efficacy and tolerability of&#xD;
      this combination in the setting of locally advanced NPC (limited to T4 or N3, stage IVA by&#xD;
      UICC 8th edition), as this group has the greatest risk of recurrence after the current&#xD;
      standard treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preliminary evidence supporting the clinical efficacy of pembrolizumab monotherapy in NPC&#xD;
      came from the KEYNOTE-028 trial, which was a global, nonrandomized, multi-cohort, phase Ib&#xD;
      trial of pembrolizumab in patients with PD-L1-positive advanced solid tumors (17). Key&#xD;
      eligibility criteria for the NPC cohort included unresectable or metastatic disease, failure&#xD;
      on prior standard therapy, and PD-L1 expression in 1% or more of tumor cells or&#xD;
      tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes. Patients received pembrolizumab 10 mg/kg every 2 weeks up to&#xD;
      2 years or until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. In the initial report,&#xD;
      twenty-seven NPC patients was evaluated. Median age was 52.0 years (range, 18 to 68 years);&#xD;
      92.6% received prior therapies for recurrent or metastatic NPC; 70.4% had received three or&#xD;
      more therapies. Partial response and stable disease were observed in seven and 14 patients,&#xD;
      respectively, for an ORR of 25.9% (95% CI, 11.1 to 46.3) over a median follow-up of 20&#xD;
      months. Drug-related adverse events that occurred in 15% or more of patients included rash&#xD;
      (25.9%), pruritus (25.9%), pain (22.2%), hypothyroidism (18.5%), and fatigue (18.5%). Grade ≥&#xD;
      3 drug-related adverse events occurred in eight patients (29.6%), and there was one&#xD;
      drug-related death (sepsis). It was concluded that pembrolizumab demonstrated antitumor&#xD;
      activity and a manageable safety profile in patients with recurrent or metastatic NPC.&#xD;

             are generally killed virus vaccines and are allowed; however, intranasal influenza&#xD;
             vaccines (eg, FluMist®) are live attenuated vaccines and are not allowed.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Has a diagnosis of immunodeficiency or is receiving chronic systemic steroid therapy&#xD;
             (in dosing exceeding 10 mg daily of prednisone equivalent) or any other form of&#xD;

             (i.e. with use of disease modifying agents, corticosteroids or immunosuppressive&#xD;
             drugs). Replacement therapy (eg., thyroxine, insulin, or physiologic corticosteroid&#xD;
             replacement therapy for adrenal or pituitary insufficiency, etc.) is not considered a&#xD;
             form of systemic treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;

             that might confound the results of the study, interfere with the subject's&#xD;
             participation for the full duration of the study, or is not in the best interest of&#xD;
             the subject to participate, in the opinion of the treating investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
         18. Has known psychiatric or substance abuse disorders that would interfere with&#xD;
