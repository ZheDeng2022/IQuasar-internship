  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      During the past century, major demographic changes have occurred in Europe which primarily&#xD;
      affect the older age groups. According to the Swiss federal office of statistics, the number&#xD;
      of senior citizens has tripled (from 5.8% to 18.0%) while the number of young adults (younger&#xD;
      than 20 years old) has decreased from 40.7% to 20.1%. There is evidence that with increasing&#xD;
      age, physical activity and fitness level decreases. Additionally to lower physical activity,&#xD;
      natural aging results in a decrease of muscle strength and a modulation of afferent and&#xD;
      efferent reflex pathways due to a slowing down of neuromuscular performance. As a&#xD;
      consequence, there are multiple consequences on general health, disease and injury rates in&#xD;
      the older population such as a higher risk of sustaining fall injuries. An intergenerational&#xD;
      approach combining balance and strength promotion appears to possess great potential for&#xD;
      fall-prevention, for satisfying physical, social and behavioral need of children and seniors&#xD;
      as well as reducing health care costs due to increased inactivity in both age groups. No&#xD;
      studies have examined the effects of intergenerational exercise and health programs.&#xD;

      During the past century, major demographic changes have occurred in Europe which primarily&#xD;
      affect the older age groups. According to the Swiss federal office of statistics, the number&#xD;
      of senior citizens has tripled (from 5.8% to 18.0%) while the number of young adults (younger&#xD;
      than 20 years old) has decreased from 40.7% to 20.1%. Population projections indicate a&#xD;
      reinforcement of this population aging during the upcoming decades. There is evidence that&#xD;
      with increasing age, physical activity and fitness level decreases. Additionally to lower&#xD;
      physical activity, natural aging results in a decrease of muscle strength and a modulation of&#xD;
      afferent and efferent reflex pathways due to a slowing down of neuromuscular performance.&#xD;
      Hence, there are multiple consequences on general health, disease and injury rates in the&#xD;
      older population such as a higher risk of sustaining fall injuries. The etiology of falls is&#xD;
      multi-factorial comprising extrinsic / environmental factors (e.g. lighting, stairs, floor&#xD;
      surfaces, obstructed walkways, inadequate handrails etc.) and/or intrinsic / subject-related&#xD;
      risk factors. Two important intrinsic risk factors are deficits in static/dynamic postural&#xD;
      control and muscular imbalance and/or weakness. Interestingly, fall rates in seniors are&#xD;
      comparable to the ones in children caused by incomplete maturation. The risk of falling&#xD;
      during a lifespan is a U-shaped curve, with the highest risk being during childhood and after&#xD;
      reaching the age of 65 and older.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Many studies have been able to prove that adequate exercise training programs reduce&#xD;
      intrinsic fall factors in seniors. Up to date, guidelines concerning fall prevention in&#xD;
      children are limited to extrinsic factors only, and it is being postulated whether&#xD;
      fall-preventive training programs should be included in physical education curricula. The&#xD;
      development of effective and attractive fall-preventive intervention programs targeting&#xD;
      intrinsic fall factors are needed in order to improve physical determinants for reducing the&#xD;
      risk of falling in both groups. Up to date, children and seniors have been examined and&#xD;
      trained separately to improve physical fitness parameters. An intergenerational approach&#xD;
      combining balance and strength promotion appears to possess great potential for&#xD;
      fall-prevention for children and seniors as well as reducing health care costs due to&#xD;
      increased inactivity in both age groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research has been able to link social-emotional competencies to early school success and the&#xD;
      growth of academic competence during elementary school. Emotional and social skill&#xD;
      development which are basic elements of social interactions such as the affective social&#xD;
      competence of an individual, are developed during early childhood and should be encouraged&#xD;
      during those stages. As children's social interactions increase in frequency and complexity,&#xD;
      they must learn to comprehend even emotionally difficult situations, they should be able to&#xD;
      set prosocial goals and determine effective ways to solve differences with peers as well as&#xD;
      adults. A child's social-emotional learning should also include relationship skills. In order&#xD;
      to build and maintain positive exchanges and satisfying relationships over time, one must&#xD;
      acquire numerous skills such as joining others in play, initiating and maintaining&#xD;
      conversations, cooperating, listening, and taking turns. Additionally, the attitudes as well&#xD;
      as the forming of stereotypes against the elderly develop early and remain fairly constant,&#xD;
      posing a strong influence on their future behavior towards others. An intergenerational&#xD;
      setting has the potential of providing an additional challenge to a child's social-emotional&#xD;
      learning as well as preventing prejudice against the aged. By exposing children to a new and&#xD;
      unknown setting, they are forced to adapt socially, thus promoting their social and emotional&#xD;
      learning abilities while positively influencing their view and attitudes towards old age.&#xD;
      Additionally, studies examining the effects of exercise on children have confirmed that&#xD;
      exercise has positive effects on social behavior, classroom behavior and several aspects of&#xD;
      academic performance as well as on general health-related quality of life in children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aging process entails diverse and distinctive cognitive changes which are primarily&#xD;
      influenced by environmental factors and lifestyle along with functional changes due to&#xD;
      biological effects. The aging process increases the risk of succumbing to a variety of&#xD;
      neurological disorders including depression, Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's dementia and&#xD;
      ischemic stroke. The decline in cognitive functions has been linked to a decrease in physical&#xD;
      and social activities. As a result, quality of life starts to decline, independent living&#xD;
      cannot be sustained, social interactions are diminished, chronic diseases such as diabetes,&#xD;
      hypertension and higher cardiovascular risks negatively impact general health and a decline&#xD;
      in muscular force, flexibility as well as agility and balance impacts daily activities.&#xD;
      Decrease in cardiopulmonary function was reported to damage cerebral cortex causing central&#xD;
      nervous system disorders, which decrease overall brain function. Both long-term research from&#xD;
      cross-sectional studies and short-term research from randomized controlled clinical trials&#xD;
      suggest that physical activity and fitness training influences brain structure and function&#xD;
      positively, thus combating the aforementioned neurological disorders. Aerobic exercise has&#xD;
      been shown to be a valid therapeutic measure to combat late-life depression and increased&#xD;
      physical fitness is a premise for maintaining cognitive functioning as well as executive&#xD;
      functioning in seniors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physical inactivity, as previously established, is one of the main causes for falls in&#xD;
      seniors on one hand, and a protective factor for succumbing to neurological disorders in the&#xD;
      aging process on the other hand. Programs to promote physical activity in the elderly is of&#xD;
      great interest to combat diseases, improve quality of life and providing a social network as&#xD;
      well as reducing risk of falling, and effective programs and methods for exercise and&#xD;
      activity promotion in seniors are therefore of great interest and importance. To implement a&#xD;
      successful physical activity promotion program in order to counter the effects of inactivity&#xD;
      and achieve desirable health outcomes, the target groups must adhere to regular physical&#xD;
      activity. Evidence suggests that physical activity promotion intervention amongst older&#xD;
      adults are generally effective when the motivators to them are suitable such as social,&#xD;
      individual and environmental support, and that prevention programs fail due to the lack of&#xD;
      target group-oriented approach. To ensure that health measures reach the elderly, it is&#xD;
      necessary to formulate messages more relevant to older people and to tailor information to&#xD;
      their specific needs and preferences. Older seniors identify the health benefits of physical&#xD;
      activity in terms of reducing the effects of aging and being fit to play with grandchildren&#xD;
      and are more likely to name personal responsibility and moral obligation to maintain one's&#xD;
      health as their motivator for participating in preventive health sports and physical&#xD;
      activities. Motivation is a key determinant of physical activity behavior, and reports of&#xD;
      sizeable attrition from programs of structures physical activity for older adults and from&#xD;
      personal home-based regimens confirm that maintaining the motivation for the necessary&#xD;
      adherence is often a challenge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intergenerational exercise groups possesses the potential to becoming an innovative strategy&#xD;
      for promoting physical activity in seniors. An intergenerational approach combining balance&#xD;
      and strength appears to possess great potential for fall-prevention, for satisfying physical,&#xD;
      social and behavioral need of children and seniors as well as reducing health care costs due&#xD;
      to increased inactivity in both age groups. Preliminary data indicates that intergenerational&#xD;
      relationships affect and influence participants of exercise programs by providing motivation&#xD;
      for seniors to exercise more regularly when children are included and to increase the&#xD;
      seniors' self-esteem. They are an opportunity to improve social integration, tolerance,&#xD;
      social responsibility as well as the development of social and emotional skills. Through&#xD;
      shared physical activities in which the generations alternate their support and help, both&#xD;
      age groups can achieve beneficial effects on psychological, social, emotional and physical&#xD;
      factors. As aforementioned, up to date children and seniors have been examined and trained&#xD;
      separately to improve physical fitness parameters, and no evidence exists on how&#xD;
      intergenerational exercise programs benefit not only physical health but also&#xD;
      social-emotional skills and psychological wellbeing. Even though no studies have examined the&#xD;
      effects of intergenerational exercise and health programs, intergenerational approaches have&#xD;
      been made in social, musical and artistic settings with promising preliminary outcomes in&#xD;
      terms of mutual understanding, tolerance and social belonging. An intergenerational setting&#xD;
      possesses the potential of providing an additional challenge to a child's social-emotional&#xD;
      learning as well as preventing prejudice against the aged. By exposing children to a new and&#xD;
      unknown setting, they are forced to adapt socially, thus promoting their social and emotional&#xD;
      learning abilities while positively influencing their view and attitudes towards old age.&#xD;
      Additionally, studies examining the effects of exercise on children have confirmed that&#xD;
      exercise has positive effects on social behavior, classroom behavior and several aspects of&#xD;
      academic performance as well as on general health-related quality of life in children. In&#xD;
      regard of the aforementioned fall incidence in both age groups, a combined exercise program&#xD;
      targeting intrinsic fall-factors (impaired static and dynamic postural control as well as&#xD;
      deficits in muscle strength) could reduce fall-risk and in turn reduce fall-related costs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Considering this background, the proposed study aims at comparing the effects of&#xD;
      intergenerational exercise training compared to peer-group exercise training and control&#xD;
      groups on parameters of psychological wellbeing and physical health. Psychological wellbeing&#xD;
      include quality of life, fear of falling, mental health, independent living, pain, social&#xD;
      participation and coping for seniors, while the children will be assessed on their emotional&#xD;
      and social capabilities such as prosocial behavior, cooperation, empathy, emotional&#xD;
      regulation and their view on aging. Physical health parameters include functional mobility,&#xD;
      static and dynamic balance as well as cardiovascular health.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following main research questions will be addressed:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Do the three exercise training groups differ in adherence to exercise program?&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Do the three intervention groups differ in terms of improving psychological wellbeing?&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Do the three intervention groups differ in terms of changes in functional mobility,&#xD;
           balance and cardiovascular health?&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research can be categorized in the risk category A according to the local ethics&#xD;
      committee. Measurements are non-invasive and represent no risk for participants. The&#xD;
      intervention consists of a psychological and physical health benefitting exercise programs.&#xD;
      The study corresponds to Category A risk for activity-related adverse events are similar or&#xD;
      lower than independent physical activity participation.&#xD;
