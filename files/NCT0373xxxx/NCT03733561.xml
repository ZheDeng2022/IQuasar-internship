        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        To participate in the study, subjects must meet all inclusion criteria at screening:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Willing and capable of giving informed consent;&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Between the ages of 18 and 45 years old, inclusive;&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Healthy, per investigator judgment, based on detailed medical history, clinical&#xD;
             laboratory safety tests, vital signs, full physical examination, and ECG;&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Nonsmoker defined as not having smoked or used any form of tobacco within 6 months&#xD;
             before screening;&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. BMI between 18.5 and 30 kg/m2, inclusive, and body weight ≥50 kg at screening;&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Willing and able to comply with study procedures, adhere to study restriction, and&#xD;
             stay at the CRU during in-patient stays required by the protocol;&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. All female subjects (childbearing potential and non-childbearing potential) must have&#xD;
             a negative serum pregnancy test result at screening. In addition, female subjects must&#xD;
             meet 1 of the following 3 conditions: (i) postmenopausal for at least 12 months&#xD;
             without an alternative medical cause, (ii) surgically sterile (hysterectomy, bilateral&#xD;
             oophorectomy, bilateral salpingectomy, or bilateral tubal ligation/occlusion) based on&#xD;
             subject report, or (iii) if of childbearing potential and heterosexually active,&#xD;
             practicing or agree to practice a highly effective method of contraception. Highly&#xD;
             effective methods of contraception include an intrauterine device (IUD), intrauterine&#xD;
             hormone-releasing system (IUS), and contraceptives (oral, skin patches, or implanted&#xD;
             or injectable products) using combined or progestogen-only hormonal contraception&#xD;
             associated with inhibition of ovulation. A vasectomized male partner is an acceptable&#xD;
             contraception method if the vasectomized partner is the sole sexual partner of the&#xD;
             female subject and the vasectomized partner has received medical confirmation of&#xD;
             surgical success. Highly effective methods of contraception must be used for at least&#xD;
             21 days prior to study drug dosing, throughout the study, and for a minimum of 1 month&#xD;
             after the end of the study to minimize the risk of pregnancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Sexually active, fertile, male patients must be willing to use acceptable&#xD;
             contraception methods throughout the study and for at least 1 month after the end of&#xD;
             the study if their partners are of childbearing potential.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. History of symptomatic orthostatic hypotension with a decrease of ≥20 mmHg in systolic&#xD;
             blood pressure (SBP) or decrease of ≥10 mmHg in diastolic blood pressure (DBP) when&#xD;
             changing from a supine to a standing position after having been in the supine position&#xD;
             for at least 5 minutes or SBP less than 105 mmHg in a supine position at screening;&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Clinically significant history of gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, musculoskeletal,&#xD;
             endocrine, hematologic, psychiatric, renal, hepatic, bronchopulmonary, neurologic,&#xD;
             immunologic, and/or lipid metabolism disorders, and/or drug hypersensitivity;&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. History of epilepsy, seizures as an adult, lifetime history of stroke, or transient&#xD;
             ischemic attack (TIA) within 1 year prior to screening;&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. History of sleep attacks or narcolepsy;&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Known or suspected malignancy within 5 years with the exception of treated and cured&#xD;
             basal cell carcinoma (skin), squamous cell carcinoma (skin), or in-situ cervical&#xD;
             carcinoma;&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Positive blood screen for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) antibody, hepatitis B&#xD;

          9. Hospital admission or major surgery within 30 days prior to screening;&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Receipt of another investigational product within one month or 5 half-lives of the&#xD;
             other investigational product, whichever is longer, before study drug administration&#xD;
             in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. History of prescription drug abuse or any illicit drug use within 6 months prior to&#xD;
             screening;&#xD;

             dosing);&#xD;
&#xD;
         17. Inability to tolerate study drug in any prior rotigotine or LY03003 trial or&#xD;
             intolerance or hypersensitivity to rotigotine or any excipients or diluents (Poly&#xD;
             (lactide-co-glycolide) [PLGA], carboxymethylcellulose sodium [SCMC], stearic acid, or&#xD;
             mannitol);&#xD;

             or other medical condition, or clinically significant laboratory abnormality that&#xD;
             would interfere with the subject's safety or study outcome in the judgment of the&#xD;
             investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
