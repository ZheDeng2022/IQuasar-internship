    <textblock>
      This phase I/II trial studies the side effects and best dose of gemcitabine, bendamustine,&#xD;
      and nivolumab when given together and to see how well they work in treating patients with&#xD;
      classic Hodgkin lymphoma that has come back or does not respond to treatment. Drugs used in&#xD;
      chemotherapy, such as gemcitabine and bendamustine, work in different ways to stop the growth&#xD;
      of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping&#xD;
      them from spreading. Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as nivolumab, may help&#xD;
      the body's immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells&#xD;
      to grow and spread. Giving gemcitabine, bendamustine, and nivolumab may work better in&#xD;
      treating patients with classic Hodgkin lymphoma.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate the toxicity and determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of combined&#xD;
      gemcitabine, bendamustine, and nivolumab in patients with relapsed/refractory classical&#xD;
      Hodgkin lymphoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To determine the efficacy of bendamustine, gemcitabine, and nivolumab in patients with&#xD;
      relapsed/refractory classical Hodgkin lymphoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate the duration of response, progression-free survival, and overall survival for&#xD;
      patients with relapsed/refractory classical Hodgkin lymphoma who receive gemcitabine,&#xD;
      bendamustine, and nivolumab, including those who receive nivolumab maintenance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose-escalation study followed by a phase II study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive gemcitabine intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on day 1, bendamustine IV&#xD;
      over 30 minutes on days 1 and 2, and nivolumab over 60 minutes IV on day 1. Treatment repeats&#xD;
      every 21 days for up to 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable&#xD;
      toxicity. Patients may then receive nivolumab IV over 60 minutes on day 1. Treatment with&#xD;
      single agent nivolumab repeats every 28 days for up to 26 courses in the absence of disease&#xD;
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 2 years.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Histologically documented classical Hodgkin lymphoma that is recurrent or refractory&#xD;
             after standard chemotherapy. Core biopsies are acceptable if they contain adequate&#xD;
             tissue for primary diagnosis and immunophenotyping. Bone marrow biopsies as the sole&#xD;
             means of diagnosis are not acceptable. At least one biopsy-proven relapse is required&#xD;
             for enrollment, but patients who have multiply relapsed disease do not require repeat&#xD;
             biopsy if not clinically indicated&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prior treatment: patients must have relapsed or progressed after at least one prior&#xD;
             therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Patients with relapsed or refractory disease following autologous stem cell&#xD;
                  transplantation are permitted. Due to the risk of treatment-refractory graft&#xD;

                  transplant are excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Patients may have received gemcitabine, bendamustine, or nivolumab in the past&#xD;
                  but may not have discontinued therapy due to toxicity felt to be related to that&#xD;
                  specific drug&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status 0-2&#xD;

                       abnormal fludeoxyglucose (FDG) avidity, consistent with active disease.&#xD;
                       Ultrasound or physical examination alone may not be utilized to confirm&#xD;
