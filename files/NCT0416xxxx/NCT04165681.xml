  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Depression, the most common mental health disorder among adolescents, is a critical health&#xD;
      problem within the US. In this study, the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary&#xD;
      efficacy of Limbix Spark, a cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT)- based mobile app + virtual&#xD;
      reality (VR) program for helping adolescents live well with depression will be investigated.&#xD;
      This program is specifically designed around behavioral activation theory, the idea that&#xD;
      completing activities that make a patient feel pleasure or provide a sense of mastery are&#xD;
      effective in reducing symptoms of depression. The program involves the use of both VR and a&#xD;
      mobile app that include CBT components like psychological assessments, psychoeducation, and&#xD;
      skills training. 30 participants aged 12-21 years old with mild to severe depressive symptoms&#xD;
      and smartphone access will be enrolled in this study. The primary efficacy outcome measures&#xD;
      will be depressive symptoms with anxiety symptoms, functional outcomes, and dimensional&#xD;
      scales of positive and negative affect and behavioral activation serving as secondary outcome&#xD;
      measures. Qualitative and quantitative feedback on the use of the VR + mobile app (ease of&#xD;
      use, comfort, willingness to use again) will be assessed using questionnaires. Engagement and&#xD;
      adherence to the program will be assessed by assessing VR and app usage.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Depression, the most common mental health disorder among adolescents, is a major public&#xD;
      health concern with significant personal, societal, and economic burdens, particularly as&#xD;
      incidence rates are increasing. Effective care for adolescent depression is limited due to&#xD;
      lack of access to care, increasingly long waitlists, stigma surrounding mental health, and&#xD;
      ineffectiveness of pharmaceutical options. There is an urgent need for accessible,&#xD;
      cost-effective, and evidence-based treatment options for adolescents with depression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The development of effective digital health programs for adolescents is a key strategy to&#xD;
      reduce the personal, familiar and societal burden of depression. Such programs provide an&#xD;
      innovative way to deliver resources in a cost-effective, accessible fashion.&#xD;
      Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) is effective in the prevention and treatment of depression&#xD;
      in children and adolescents. Digital forms of CBT have also been shown to be efficacious in&#xD;
      the treatment of anxiety and depressive symptoms in youth, however. adherence to such&#xD;
      programs in clinical trials and particularly in real world evidence evaluations is low.&#xD;
      Virtual reality (VR) holds promise as a way to enhance adherence to and the efficacy of&#xD;
      digital CBT for depression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To address the need for effective, accessible, and engaging treatments for adolescent&#xD;
      depression, the objective of this project is to evaluate the feasibility, acceptability, and&#xD;
      preliminary evidence of efficacy of Limbix Spark: a 5 week CBT-based mobile + VR self-guided&#xD;
      program. Limbix Spark is specifically designed to implement behavioral activation, a CBT&#xD;
      skill, which involves completing self-monitored activities that provide a sense of pleasure&#xD;
      or mastery in order to reduce depressive symptoms and improve functional outcomes. VR allows&#xD;
      adolescents to complete such activities in virtual environments as a potential stepping stone&#xD;
      to engaging in similar experiences in the real world.&#xD;
&#xD;
      30 participants aged 12-21 years old with mild to severe depressive symptoms and with smart&#xD;
      phone access will be enrolled. During a baseline visit, participants or participants' legal&#xD;
      guardians, will be asked to provide written informed consent and potential participants under&#xD;
      18 will be asked to provide written assent after study procedures are explained and any&#xD;
      questions are answered by study staff in accordance with good clinical practice (GCP) and&#xD;
      human subjects research guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After consent, all eligible participants will be assigned to complete the 5-week Limbix Spark&#xD;
      program. Participants and their legal guardian if under 18 will first complete baseline&#xD;
      assessments, including the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-8) Generalized Anxiety Disorder&#xD;
      scale (GAD-7), the Positive and Negative Affective Schedule (PANAS-C), the Behavioral&#xD;
      Activation for Depression Scale-Short Form (BADS-SF), 20-item Short Form Survey (SF-20), Mood&#xD;
      and Feelings Questionnaire Short Parent version (MFQ-PS). Participants will then receive VR&#xD;
      equipment, and receive an initial orientation to the Limbix Spark program. Program&#xD;
      orientation will include training on how to set up and use the VR headset and how to download&#xD;
      and use the mobile app.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The 5 modules in the Limbix Spark program are meant to be completed weekly, however,&#xD;
      participants will be allowed to progress through the program at their own pace. Each module&#xD;
      contains VR and mobile app components and is expected to take no more than 60 minutes to&#xD;
      complete, with no more than approximately 25 min per module of VR content. Modules do not&#xD;
      need to be completed in a single session and can be completed over the course of several&#xD;
      days. During the program, weekly PHQ-8 assessments will be completed within the mobile app.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the post-intervention site visit, participants and their legal guardian if under 18 will&#xD;
      complete post-program assessments, including the PHQ-8, GAD-7, PANAS-C, MFQ-PS, SF-20, and&#xD;
      BADS-SF, as well as a questionnaire about their thoughts and experiences with the Spark&#xD;
      program. Participants will also complete a qualitative interview to further understand their&#xD;
      experience with the program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One month after the post-intervention site visit, participants will be sent a 1-month follow&#xD;
      up questionnaires via email, including the PHQ-8, GAD-7, PANAS-C, MFQ-PS, SF-20, and BADS-SF,&#xD;
      as well as a questionnaire about their thoughts and experiences with the Spark program.&#xD;
