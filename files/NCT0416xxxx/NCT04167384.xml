  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a two-arm, single use, single-center, randomized, 10-sequence per arm, open-label,&#xD;
      crossover pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) study, designed to evaluate elements of&#xD;
      abuse liability (AL) including subjective effects, plasma nicotine uptake, and physiological&#xD;
      measures during and following ad libitum use of the study investigational products (IPs) by&#xD;
      generally healthy subjects.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cigarette smokers and smokers who also use smokeless tobacco (SST) [e.g., snus, moist snuff]&#xD;
      will be recruited into the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Starting on Day -1, eligible subjects will be confined at the clinical site for 6 days.&#xD;
      Subjects will be randomized to evaluate one IP in each of five separate Test Sessions, such&#xD;
      that each subject will evaluate five IPs: one of two forms of the nicotine lozenge in three&#xD;
      different regimens, a commercially-available nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) nicotine&#xD;
      lozenge, and the subjects' usual brand (UB) cigarettes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each Test Session will last for approximately 6 hours during and following IP use and will&#xD;
      include collection of subjective measures, PK assessments and physiological measures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Day -1, subjects will be instructed on how to use both the specific lozenge IP in their&#xD;
      assigned study arm and the NRT lozenge and will have one trial use of both IP.&#xD;
