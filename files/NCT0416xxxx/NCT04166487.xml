      This research study is studying to see if a blood test, collected at different times during&#xD;
      the treatment of metastatic non-small lung cancer, can be used to detect early response in&#xD;
      patients being treated with pembrolizumab and use that information to determine whether&#xD;
      patients should continue treatment with pembrolizumab or switch treatment to pembrolizumab in&#xD;
      combination with chemotherapy.&#xD;

&#xD;
      The purpose of this research study is to determine if a blood test, collected at different&#xD;
      times during treatment, can be used to detect early response in patients being treated with&#xD;
      pembrolizumab for lung cancer and use that information to determine whether patients should&#xD;
      continue treatment with pembrolizumab or switch treatment to pembrolizumab in combination&#xD;
      with chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      -The research study procedures include screening for eligibility and study treatment&#xD;
      including evaluations approximately every 3 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
        -  InVision- Inivata&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  This blood test that will help study how participants respond to the study&#xD;
                treatment. ---&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Blood will be collected for this test at a few time points, both before and after&#xD;
                participants receive treatment on study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be on the research study for up to 12 months.&#xD;

          -  The effects of pembrolizumab on the developing human fetus are unknown. For this&#xD;
             reason and because immune checkpoint blockade agents as well as other therapeutic&#xD;
             agents used in this trial are known to be teratogenic, women of child-bearing&#xD;
             potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method&#xD;
             of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry and for the duration of study&#xD;

&#xD;
                    -  Response of Partial Response or Complete Response at Cycle 3 imaging&#xD;
                       assessment (as determined by TIMC).&#xD;

        plasma response.&#xD;
&#xD;
        OR&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Response of Progressive Disease at Cycle 3 imaging assessment (as determined by TIMC)&#xD;
             without worsening cancer symptoms (as determined by the treating investigator) AND&#xD;

&#xD;
             -- For participants continuing pembrolizumab + doublet chemotherapy:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Response of Stable Disease at Cycle 3 imaging assessment (as determined by TIMC) AND&#xD;
             no plasma response.&#xD;
&#xD;

        TIMC) without worsening cancer symptoms (as determined by the treating investigator) AND no&#xD;
        plasma response.&#xD;
&#xD;
        - NOTE: Patients with a response of Progressive Disease at Cycle 3 imaging assessment (as&#xD;
        determined by TIMC) with worsening cancer symptoms (as determined by the treating&#xD;
        investigator) must come off treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;

             the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants who are receiving any other investigational agents.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants with uncontrolled brain metastases, leptomeningeal disease, or spinal&#xD;
             cord compression. Patients with asymptomatic untreated brain metastases are eligible.&#xD;
             Patients with treated CNS disease are eligible if stable disease is clinically&#xD;
             confirmed ≥2 weeks after definitive CNS therapy (radiation or surgery), and the&#xD;
             patient is not receiving systemic steroids ≥10mg of prednisone equivalent at the time&#xD;
             of enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic&#xD;
             composition to pembrolizumab or other agents used in study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ongoing or active autoimmune disease requiring systemic steroids of ≥10mg of&#xD;
             prednisone equivalent or other systemic immunomodulatory agents at the time of&#xD;
             enrollment. Type I diabetes mellitus, hypothyroidism only requiring hormone&#xD;
             replacement, skin disorders (such as psoriasis, vitiligo, and alopecia) not requiring&#xD;
             systemic therapy, or conditions not expected to recur in the absence of an external&#xD;
             trigger are allowed.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active&#xD;
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac&#xD;
             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with&#xD;
             study requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because pembrolizumab is a Pregnancy&#xD;
             Category D agent with the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Because&#xD;
             there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary&#xD;
             to treatment of the mother with pembrolizumab, breastfeeding should be discontinued if&#xD;
             the mother is treated with pembrolizumab. These potential risks may also apply to&#xD;
             other agents used in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants with a known history of testing positive for human immunodeficiency virus&#xD;
             (HIV) or known acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) are excluded from this study.&#xD;
