  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The burden of non-communicable disease is on the rise in low- and middle- income&#xD;
      countries.Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of morbidity, mortality, and disability&#xD;
      in South Asian regions. Diabetes mellitus is among the top five risk factors for&#xD;
      cardiovascular deaths in the world.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite the evidence supporting the use of lifestyle interventions to prevent diabetes and&#xD;
      improve glucose tolerance, their translation in real world has been challenging.&#xD;
      Work-site-based health programs have shown positive impacts on employee health, and have&#xD;
      shown significant improvements in blood glucose levels and HbA1C.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research will be conducted in 1) Hulas wire Industry and 2) Pragati Textile Industry&#xD;
      Private limited.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigator will conduct before-and-after intervention among pre-diabetic employees.In&#xD;
      addition screening will be done to identify the eligible participants.Those who are&#xD;
      pregnant,under diabetic and hypertensive medication will be excluded from the study. All of&#xD;
      the interested adult employees (≥18 years) will be invited for the first screening. All&#xD;
      individuals with HbA1C from 5.7% to 6.4 % will be invited to participate in the study. At&#xD;
      baseline, investigators will administer a standardized questionnaire to record the&#xD;
      characteristics of the participants.Blood samples will be collected and analyzed for HbA1c,&#xD;
      fasting glucose, and lipid profile.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators will have a wait period before implementing any intervention.After completion&#xD;
      of control period,half of the participants will be randomized to receive behavioral&#xD;
      interventions. Behavior intervention will comprise of combination of intensive education&#xD;
      session, group counseling, goal setting and monitoring.Trained nurses will deliver the&#xD;
      sessions once every week for two months and then once every month.All the participants will&#xD;
      receive canteen intervention after behavioral intervention which will comprise of promotion&#xD;
      of healthy foods in the canteen of the study site i.e Improve physical facility ,increase&#xD;
      access to healthy food, Information, Education and communication, changes in food price and&#xD;
      training of canteen staffs Investigators will conduct follow up at 6 months, 12 months, and&#xD;
      18 months and if funds are available at 24 months. During each follow up, the proportion of&#xD;
      unhealthy diet consumption data will be abstracted. In addition, blood samples will be&#xD;
      collected and analyzed for HbA1c, fasting glucose, and lipid profile .This period will serve&#xD;
      as control group.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Diabetes is the fifth leading cause of death in the most high-income countries and there is&#xD;
      substantial evidence that it is epidemic in many low- and middle-income countries.&#xD;
      Complications from diabetes, such as coronary artery and peripheral vascular disease, stroke,&#xD;
      diabetic neuropathy, amputations, renal failure and blindness results in disability, reduced&#xD;
      life expectancy and enormous health costs.The global age standardized prevalence of diabetes&#xD;
      has nearly doubled since 1980, rising from 4.7% to 8.5% in the adult population.In Nepal,&#xD;
      there is a lack of reliable and representative data on the prevalence of type 2&#xD;
      diabetes.Various small studies from different parts of the country have shown prevalence&#xD;
      rates ranging from 6.3% to 8.5%.The burden of diabetes in terms of disability adjusted life&#xD;
      years has increased almost 100% from 1990 to 2010. A pilot study in an industrial setting&#xD;
      showed a prevalence of 4% diabetes and 31% pre-diabetes among adult employees.The prevention&#xD;
      of type 2 diabetes through lifestyle intervention has been established by several clinical&#xD;
      trials.These studies had a strong focus on increased physical activity and dietary&#xD;
      modification as well as weight reduction among overweight participants. The US Diabetes&#xD;
      Prevention Program clinical trial demonstrated that structured lifestyle interventions-such&#xD;
      as training people with pre-diabetes to achieve modest weight loss through diet and physical&#xD;
      activity-reduced three-year diabetes incidence by 58 percent. Studies have shown that simple&#xD;
      modifications to the physical environment can be important in increasing physical activity&#xD;
      and altering dietary habits. However, the translation of the knowledge to the real world&#xD;
      setting is a challenge. Strategies to translate the preventive measures by innovative and&#xD;
      culturally specific environmental and individual level intervention are lacking.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Work-site could be an effective platform to translate this knowledge into action as employed&#xD;
      adults spend most of their workday waking hours at workplaces.Workplaces have additional&#xD;
      advantages because of convenience to reach people; social support; existing formal and&#xD;
      informal communication networks; and possible corporate behavior network.Studies have shown&#xD;
      positive impact of diabetes prevention at work-site and other&#xD;
      settings.Additionally,environmental changes to the work-sites can achieve modest improvement&#xD;
      in employees' health risks, including weight and body mass index ( BMI) measures, in one year&#xD;
      and reduced glycated hemoglobin(HbA1c) among pre-diabetic adult employee. In 2013,&#xD;
      investigators conducted a survey of cardiovascular disease risk factors among employees of a&#xD;
      wire industry in the eastern Nepal. The study showed that about a third of the employees were&#xD;
      pre-diabetic and 4% had diabetes. Investigators established an ongoing work-site screening&#xD;
      and preventive cardiovascular disease care program in the wire industry in January 2016.&#xD;
      Furthermore, investigators conducted a qualitative study to understand willingness,&#xD;
      facilitators and barriers to promote healthy diet in the industry cafeteria (unpublished).&#xD;
      Building on these ground works, investigators propose implementing and evaluating the&#xD;
      effectiveness of a work-site based lifestyle modification - an environmental modification in&#xD;
      cafeterias and a lifestyle change education package.Investigators propose a pre-post trial&#xD;
      with a control period to assess the effectiveness of the individual level lifestyle&#xD;
      intervention on diabetes risk reduction among pre-diabetic (HbA1c of 5.7 to 6.4%) employees&#xD;
      of two industries in Nepal.Investigators will provide lifestyle education to half of the&#xD;
      randomly selected participants after 6 to 14 months of control period. Additionally,&#xD;
      cafeteria intervention will be provided to all the pre-diabetic participants. The study aims&#xD;
      to:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1: To measure the effectiveness of an environmental-level cafeteria intervention on&#xD;
      diabetes risk.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2: To measure the effectiveness of an individual-level lifestyle education on the risk of&#xD;
      diabetes prevention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the program is shown to be effective at these work-sites, the results of this study will&#xD;
      be used to recommend and disseminate a sustainable environment and lifestyle interventions at&#xD;
      work-sites to improve the health of workers, other Nepali work-sites, and to Nepal's national&#xD;
      program for prevention and control of non- communicable disease. Furthermore, lessons from&#xD;
      this study can be used to make recommendations or plan studies of similar work-site programs&#xD;
      in the U.S. and other settings outside of Nepal.&#xD;
