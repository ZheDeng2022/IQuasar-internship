  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study, researchers were primarily interested in evaluating the level of agreement of&#xD;
      cooling sensation provided by this chewable, flavored, allergy medicine. Participants joining&#xD;
      this study received one test drug tablet and were asked to chew completely before swallowing&#xD;
      the drug. A questionnaire was used to collect the feedback from participants. The study&#xD;
      involved only one (1) visit and participant stayed in this study for about 60-75 minutes to&#xD;
      evaluate the cooling sensation as well as other sensory attributes perceived in the mouth,&#xD;
      nose and throat.&#xD;

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Time to Perception of Cooling Sensation</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 60 minutes post ingestion of study medication</time_frame>
    <description>The mean time point at which cooling was initially perceived was claimed as the onset of cooling. The mean onsets of cooling sensation in the mouth, nose and throat were reported.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Duration of Cooling Sensation</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 60 minutes post ingestion of study medication</time_frame>
    <description>Participants who reported that they never experienced a cooling sensation were not included in the model. Those for whom the cooling sensation extended for 60 minutes or more were considered right-censored and were treated as such in the model. The median time of cooling sensation in the mouth, nose and throat was reported. Dispersion values were not calculated for this sensory study.</description>
