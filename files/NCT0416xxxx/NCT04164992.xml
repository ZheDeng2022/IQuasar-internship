  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) remains one of the most aggressive tumors with a poor&#xD;
      prognosis. Despite advancements in the multimodal approach, surgical resection still&#xD;
      represents the only potentially curative treatment. However, more than 80% of patients are&#xD;
      diagnosed at a non-resectable stage. Local ablative techniques are therefore emerging as&#xD;
      complementary treatments in the multimodal strategy for un-resectable non-metastatic disease.&#xD;
      Although radio frequency ablation (RFA) is already well established in other clinical&#xD;
      settings, its role in the treatment of pancreatic lesions is still under evaluation. Several&#xD;
      animal studies and small human clinical series are assessing the feasibility and safety of&#xD;
      different RFA systems and settings to limit adverse events due to thermic damage, acute&#xD;
      pancreatitis, stomach and duodenal transmural burns, perforations, and bleeding.&#xD;
&#xD;
      By now, three studies evaluated the feasibility and safety of EUS RFA in patients with&#xD;
      locally advanced and metastatic PDAC showing that it is feasible and safe, However, the exact&#xD;
      role of EUS-RFA in PDAC management must be further assessed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary aim of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of endoscopic ultrasound&#xD;
      radiofrequency ablation (EUS-RFA) by obtaining the tumour ablation in patients with locally&#xD;
      advanced pancreatic cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary aim is to evaluate the safety of this procedure and its effect on symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria: Patients with a cyto/histological diagnosis of PDAC, which was&#xD;
      non-resectable and had no metastases after first line chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy; a&#xD;
      solid pancreatic lesion that was resectable but not suitable for surgery due to the patient's&#xD;
      comorbidities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients enrolled will have a blood examination (including Carbohydrate Antigen 19.9) and a&#xD;
      contrast-enhanced CT scan no more than 7 days before the procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be administered a questionnaire about demographic features, symptoms, quality&#xD;
      of life and drugs used. Tumours features and the type of chemotherapy protocol will also be&#xD;
      recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EUS-RFA will be performed with the patients placed on the le lateral position under deep&#xD;
      sedation, employing a linear-array echoendoscope. An 19-gauge EUSRA electrode needle&#xD;
      connected to a radiofrequency generator (VIVA RF generator; &quot;STARmed&quot;, Seoul, S. Korea) will&#xD;
      be used in all patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The procedure will be considered feasible if it will be possible to insert the electrode into&#xD;
      the targeted point and to apply the radiofrequency energy for a sufficient time. All&#xD;
      procedures will be started with a preset radiofrequency power of 30 Watt. If necessary, the&#xD;
      procedure will be repeated by reinserting the needle in another part of the lesion until&#xD;
      obtaining the largest possible ablation of the tumour.The radiofrequency power, duration of&#xD;
      the ablation, the number of passages of the electrode necessary to obtain the ablation will&#xD;
      be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical evaluation and laboratory tests (complete blood count, liver function tests, and&#xD;
      serum amylase/lipase levels) will be performed at 24 h after the procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CECT) scan will be performed one day and one month&#xD;
      after the procedure to check the treatment outcome and exclude early and late adverse events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Technical success will be defined by achieving tumour ablation defined by the presence of a&#xD;
      hypodense area inside the tumour detectable at CECT scan. The volume of the ablated area (and&#xD;
      its percentage in respect to the original tumour volume) will be calculated.&#xD;

    <description>The operative needle (EUSRA-STARMED) is a novel monopolar 18 gauge radiofrequency ablation (RFA) electrode that is placed in the echoendoscope operative channel. It is 140 cm long with a sharp conical 1 cm tip for energy delivery. The needle is associated with an internal cooling system connected via a pump to an external cold saline solution source (0 °C) that prevents the charring of the tip and improves the ablation accuracy.</description>
