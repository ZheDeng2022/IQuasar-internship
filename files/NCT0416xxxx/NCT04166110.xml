  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Primary aim: to demonstrate that stopping antibiotic treatment in patients diagnosed with&#xD;
      acute community acquired pneumonia (CAP) based on clinical response has a non-inferior&#xD;
      efficacy 15 days after start of treatment, compared to a conventional predetermined duration&#xD;
      left to the physician's judgement, in adults treated in the community setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary aims: To compare the 2 study arms on:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Clinical success at late follow up (Day 30),&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Duration of antibiotic treatment,&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Frequency and severity of adverse events,&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Patient's pneumonia symptoms and quality of life.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Recent studies have suggested that CAP can be successfully treated by short-course antibiotic&#xD;
      regimen when clinical improvement is rapidly obtained. Even if clinical response is obtained&#xD;
      in 3 days in the majority of cases, it can widely vary among patients, suggesting that &quot;one&#xD;
      duration does not fit all&quot;. An individualized duration of therapy depending on the patient's&#xD;
      response could help to ensure bacterial eradication while avoiding unnecessary antibiotic&#xD;
      exposure and thus reduce antibiotic resistance. At present, this strategy has never been&#xD;
      tested.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a pragmatic open label non-inferiority randomized multicenter trial with two parallel&#xD;
      arms comparing antibiotic treatment duration left to the physician's judgement (usually 7 to&#xD;
      14 days), versus interruption of treatment based on the patient's clinical response defined&#xD;
      by reaching stability criteria (body temperature ≤ 37.8°C; heart rate ≤ 100/min; systolic&#xD;
      blood pressure ≥ 90mmHg, oxygen saturation ≥ 90%) for 24h, after a minimum of 2 days&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment and follow-up: Outpatients consulting in a private multiprofessional health&#xD;
      center, diagnosed as having CAP and in need for antibiotics will be assessed for eligibility.&#xD;
      Following information and signing consent, eligible patients will be included in the study.&#xD;
      They will receive the prescription (antibiotic type and duration determined by the physician,&#xD;
      preferably chosen according to the French guidelines) and a collection of connected devices&#xD;
      to monitor their vital signs 2 times a day (morning and evening). Preselected patients will&#xD;
      be randomized as soon as they meet the two following criteria: i) they have presented the&#xD;
      stability criteria for 24h (3 consecutive vital signs recordings); ii) they have started the&#xD;
      antibiotic treatment at least 72 hours before, with a ≥ 80% compliance, and with at least 1&#xD;
      intake in the last 24 hours. Each patient will then receive a telephone call from the&#xD;
      coordinating team (or a permanent medical platform at nights, during weekends or public&#xD;
      holidays) in order to proceed to the randomization and ensure that everything is well&#xD;
      understood by the patient as well as the security and compliance with the strategy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A follow-up visit with the investigator will be performed at day 15 after the start of&#xD;
      antibiotic treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The final evaluation will be performed 30 days following the start of antibiotic treatment by&#xD;
      a telephone call from the coordinating team.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Number of subjects necessary: 310 patients.&#xD;
