  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Individuals who use wheelchairs are at an increased risk of developing pressure injuries on&#xD;
      the parts of the body that are in constant contact with the wheelchair. The development of&#xD;
      pressure injuries can cause reduced mobility, reduced activity and participation, greater&#xD;
      unemployment, increased risk for future pressure injury development, and premature death.&#xD;
      There are numerous risk factors associated with developing pressure injuries. Individuals can&#xD;
      reduce the risk of pressure injury formation by changing positions, weight-shifting, and&#xD;
      using special cushions, but many people still struggle with pressure injuries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is designed to assess the clinical effectiveness of WiSAT (Wheelchair in-Seat&#xD;
      Activity Tracker). WiSAT is a tool designed to help prevent the development of pressure&#xD;
      ulcers by changing behaviors that can lead to pressure ulcers. WiSAT monitors and provides&#xD;
      real-time feedback on weight shifts and pressure relief behaviors while sitting in a&#xD;
      wheelchair.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Pressure injuries are a serious health concern for individuals who use wheelchairs.&#xD;
      Wheelchair users are at an increased risk of developing pressure injuries on the parts of the&#xD;
      body that are in constant contact with the wheelchair. The development of pressure injuries&#xD;
      can cause negative consequences on their lives. Pressure injuries often lead to reduced&#xD;
      mobility, reduced activity and participation, greater unemployment, increased risk for future&#xD;
      pressure injury development, and premature death. Some risk factors associated with&#xD;
      developing pressure injuries include continual pressure, nutrition, shear forces, and&#xD;
      moisture. Individuals whose use wheelchairs can reduce the risk of pressure injury formation&#xD;
      by changing positions, weight-shifting, and using skin protection cushions, but many people&#xD;
      still struggle with pressure injuries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will assess the clinical effectiveness and usability of WiSAT (Wheelchair in-Seat&#xD;
      Activity Tracker). WiSAT provides real-time feedback on in-seat movement, including&#xD;
      volitional pressure reliefs and weight-shift activity. The study's aim is to assess whether&#xD;
      monitoring and feedback of in-seat movement can change the behavior of wheelchair users by&#xD;
      increasing movement activities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Protocol: The study will prospectively collect in-seat movement activity during&#xD;
      everyday life for wheelchair users at risk for pressure ulcers. Seventy-six individuals who&#xD;
      are full-time users of wheelchairs and have a self-reported risk for pressure ulcers on the&#xD;
      buttocks (sacrum/coccyx, ischial tuberosity, trochanter) will be recruited for the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each person will have two appointments with investigators to educate, set them up with the&#xD;
      WiSAT system and finally to remove the sensor system from the cushion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first visit will take approximately 1.5 to 2 hours, in which participants will provide&#xD;
      written informed consent. During this visit, demographic and clinical information will be&#xD;
      collected via self-report. All participants will then receive education about skin health&#xD;
      including information about pressure ulcers, prevention strategies such as pressure relieving&#xD;
      techniques in both bed and wheelchair, and the importance of checking skin regularly for&#xD;
      signs of pressure issues. The WiSAT hardware will be placed within the cover and beneath&#xD;
      their current wheelchair cushion to measure and transmit baseline seat movement activity;&#xD;
      with no mobile application and visual feedback initiated at this time. Subjects' baseline&#xD;
      behavior will be monitored for two weeks to serve as the comparator for the enabled WiSAT&#xD;
      system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After 14 days of baseline monitoring, the app will automatically switch to feedback mode.&#xD;
      Participants will be informed that they can now monitor their movement activity. Each subject&#xD;
      will be given the ability to set his or her own goals using the app settings. The movement&#xD;
      activity feedback will be provided passively for four weeks, requiring them to view the&#xD;
      application on their smartphone to see daily movement activity data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the four weeks of app use, recorded movement activity will be used to categorize&#xD;
      participants as meeting or not meeting the movement threshold. Subjects who do not attain&#xD;
      their movement threshold will be provided with active feedback using audible and/or haptic&#xD;
      reminders. Those who have reached their threshold will continue to access the app to review&#xD;
      their activity (passive feedback).&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will be followed for a total of 5 months: 2 weeks baseline, four weeks&#xD;
      passive visual feedback only, and 3.5 months of passive and/or active feedback. Once the&#xD;
      participants have completed their 5 months of using WiSAT, they will return to clinic for&#xD;
      their second visit. The second visit will last for approximately one hour. During this visit,&#xD;
      the WiSAT system will be to removed and the study team will collect feedback on usability and&#xD;
      acceptability of the activity tracker.&#xD;
