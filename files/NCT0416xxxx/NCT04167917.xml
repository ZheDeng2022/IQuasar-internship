             potential (ie, fertile) following menarche and until becoming postmenopausal, unless&#xD;
             permanently sterile. Permanent sterilization methods include hysterectomy, bilateral&#xD;

             pregnant or father a child for 3 months after the last dose of study treatment.&#xD;
             Contraceptive measures that may be considered highly effective comprise combined&#xD;
             hormonal contraception (oral, vaginal, or transdermal) or progestogen-only hormonal&#xD;
             contraception (oral, injectable, implantable) associated with inhibition of ovulation,&#xD;
             intrauterine device, intrauterine hormone-releasing system, bilateral tubal occlusion,&#xD;
             sexual abstinence, and surgically successful vasectomy. Abstinence is acceptable only&#xD;
             if it is consistent with the preferred and usual lifestyle of the subject. Periodic&#xD;
             abstinence (eg, calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, or post-ovulation methods) and&#xD;
             withdrawal are not acceptable methods of birth control.&#xD;

                  suspicion for CNS disease; patients with history of CNS disease are permitted to&#xD;
                  enroll if they have previously received appropriate therapy and CNS remission has&#xD;
                  been; participants on maintenance intrathecal chemotherapy may be enrolled and&#xD;
                  continue to receive therapy]&#xD;

                  unstable angina pectoris, myocardial infarction within the past 6 months,&#xD;
                  uncontrolled cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that&#xD;
                  would limit compliance with study requirements in the opinion of the investigator&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Malabsorption syndrome or other conditions that would interfere with intestinal&#xD;
                  absorption.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. History of a second malignancy, excluding non-melanoma skin cell cancer, within the&#xD;
             last three years. Participants with second malignancies that were indolent, in situ or&#xD;

             treatment. Consult the monitor if there are any queries.&#xD;
