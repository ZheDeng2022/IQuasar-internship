    <textblock>
      This trial will try to establish the feasibility and efficacy of the combination of DaraVCD&#xD;
      in Multiple Myeloma (MM) patients presenting with extramedullary disease (EMD). The study&#xD;
      will be conducted as a Phase II trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Forty patients will be included in the study cohort. All patients will be followed closely&#xD;
      for toxicities and response assessment. After completion of treatment, patients will be&#xD;
      followed every 6 months for survival until 5 years after enrolment&#xD;

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Confirmed diagnosis of Multiple Myeloma(MM) (IMWG consensus guidelines)&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Newly diagnosed or relapsed (patients should have received a maximum of one line of&#xD;
             prior therapy) patients presenting with extramedullary disease (EMD) of the skin,&#xD;
             liver, lungs, central nervous system, lymph nodes or other tissues, but not solely&#xD;
             paraskeletal plasmacytoma (expanding soft tissue masses)* detected by physical exam&#xD;
             and confirmed (when required) by Weight Bearing CT/MRI/PET-CT and/or biopsy**.&#xD;
             Documentation of plasma cell infiltration is highly recommended unless it requires&#xD;
             invasive surgical intervention such as intracerebral infiltration of plasmacytomas.&#xD;
&#xD;
             *Note: patients with only paraosseous extension of MM forming soft tissue&#xD;
             plasmacytomas are not eligible&#xD;
&#xD;
             **Note: An additional radiologic assessment at screening is not required to confirm&#xD;
             EMD. Documentation in terms of physician's/pathologist's report and/or radiologic&#xD;
             assessments performed within 42 days of C1D1 will suffice for the purposes of&#xD;
             eligibility. All patients however will undergo a baseline radiologic assessment at&#xD;
             C1D1 for response purposes.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Patients with one prior line of therapy must have:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  achieved a response (PR or better based on investigator's determination of&#xD;
                  response by the IMWG criteria) to at least one prior regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  documented evidence of PD based on Investigator's determination of response as&#xD;
                  defined by the IMWG criteria on or after the last line of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Age ≥ 18 years&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status ≤ 2. Note: for patients&#xD;
             with central nervous system (CNS) involvement, an ECOG performance status &gt;2 is also&#xD;
             acceptable&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Each patient must sign an informed consent form (ICF) indicating that he or she&#xD;
             understands the purpose of and procedures required for the study and are willing to&#xD;
             participate in the study. Patients must be willing and able to adhere to the&#xD;
             prohibitions and restrictions specified in this protocol, as referenced in the ICF.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Patient must have measurable disease of MM as defined by the below criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  IgG MM: Serum M protein level ≥1.0 g/dL or urine M protein level ≥200 mg/24&#xD;
                  hours, or&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  IgA, IgD, IgE, IgM MM: Serum M-protein level ≥0.5 g/dL or urine M-protein level&#xD;
                  ≥200 mg/24 hours; or&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Light chain MM, for patients without measurable disease in the serum or urine:&#xD;
                  Serum immunoglobulin free light chain (FLC) ≥10 mg/dL and abnormal serum&#xD;
                  immunoglobulin kappa lambda FLC ratio.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Reproductive Status&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Women of childbearing potential (WOCBP) must have a negative serum or urine&#xD;
                  pregnancy test at screening. Females are not of childbearing potential if they&#xD;
                  have been in natural menopause for at least 24 consecutive months, or have had a&#xD;
                  hysterectomy and/or bilateral oophorectomy&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Women must not be breastfeeding&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  WOCBP must agree to follow instructions for reliable methods of birth control.&#xD;
                  This includes one highly effective (&lt; 1% failure rate per year) form of&#xD;
                  contraception (tubal ligation, intrauterine device (IUD), combined or progestogen&#xD;
                  only hormonal contraception associated with inhibition of ovulation [birth&#xD;
                  control pills, injections, hormonal patches, vaginal rings or implants] or&#xD;
                  partner's vasectomy) and one additional effective contraceptive method (male&#xD;
                  latex or synthetic condom, diaphragm, or cervical cap). Contraception must begin&#xD;
                  4 weeks before the start of treatment and continue for the duration of study&#xD;
                  treatment and for 3 months after cessation of daratumumab or 12 months after&#xD;
                  cessation of cyclophosphamide, whichever is longer.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Males who are sexually active must always use a latex or synthetic condom during&#xD;
                  any sexual contact with females of reproductive potential, even if they have&#xD;
                  undergone a successful vasectomy. They must also agree to follow instructions for&#xD;
                  methods of contraception for 4 weeks before the start of study treatment, for the&#xD;
                  duration of study treatment, and for 3 months after cessation of daratumumab or 6&#xD;
                  months after cessation of cyclophosphamide, whichever is longer.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Female patients must not donate eggs for up to 3 months after cessation of&#xD;
                  daratumumab or 12 months after cessation of cyclophosphamide, whichever is&#xD;
                  longer.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Male patients must not donate sperm for up to 3 months after cessation of&#xD;
                  daratumumab or 6 months after cessation of cyclophosphamide, whichever is longer.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Azoospermic males and WOCBP who are not heterosexually active are exempt from&#xD;
                  contraceptive requirements. However, WOCBP will still undergo pregnancy testing&#xD;
                  as described above.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Solitary plasmacytoma&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Paraosseous extension of MM forming soft tissue plasmacytomas only (without EMD).&#xD;
