      Erector spinae plane block (ESP block) was first described by Forero et al for the treatment&#xD;
      of neuropathic chest pain. Total hip arthroplasty is a surgery with a high potential for&#xD;
      severe postoperative pain, and greater attention should be paid to postoperative analgesia.&#xD;
      There are multiple forms of postoperative analgesia for total hip arthroplasty, such as&#xD;
      subarachnoid morphine, femoral nerve block, obturator and lateral femoral cutaneous block,&#xD;
      lumbar plexus block, continuous epidural block, and &quot;3 in 1&quot; block, for example. ESP (LESP)&#xD;
      block has emerged based on the same principle as the ESP block in the thoracic region. So&#xD;
      far, to the best of our knowledge, there are only a few case reports that evidence its use&#xD;
      for hip surgery analgesia. This study aimed to study the local anesthetic dispersion and the&#xD;
      mechanism of action of the blockade.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An experimental, analytical and prospective study will be carried out in which eight fresh&#xD;
      adult human cadavers will be selected and injected with 20 ml of 0.01% methylene blue&#xD;
      solution at L4 level. The injection will be performed with a Quincke 20G 100-150mm&#xD;
      ultrasound-guided needle with a low-frequency curvilinear transducer (4-8 MHz - SonoSite) in&#xD;
      the plane between the transverse process of L4 and the spinal erector muscle, bilaterally in&#xD;
      each cadaver. by the same operator. After injection of the solution, the cadavers will be&#xD;
      submitted to posterior lumbar region dissection by an anatomist and analyzed the dispersion&#xD;
      and impregnation of the blue solution.&#xD;

      1. INTRODUCTION&#xD;
&#xD;
           Erector spinae plane block (ESP block) was first described by Forero et al for the&#xD;
           treatment of neuropathic chest pain, in which anesthetic is injected between the spinal&#xD;
           erector muscle and the transverse vertebral process in the thoracic region, and in&#xD;
           theory, it tends to spread to the anterior paravertebral space, to some vertebral spaces&#xD;
           above and below the injection site. However, its mechanism of action and exact local&#xD;
           anesthetic dispersion have not yet been fully explained clearly.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Such blockade, first described for neuropathic chest pain and later expanded for&#xD;
           thoracic and abdominal surgery, has shown other applicability, such as cardiac and&#xD;
           breast surgeries.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Forero et al published in July 2018 a study to anatomically demonstrate, from cadaver&#xD;
           dissection, the dispersion of dye injected into the same ESP block target at different&#xD;
           thoracic levels. They showed the dispersion of methylene blue to the anterior&#xD;
           paravertebral space at the injection level in all cadavers, with variable cerebrospinal&#xD;
           flow dispersion. In addition there was lateral and medial dispersion to the puncture&#xD;
           site, for intercostal spaces, paravertebral sympathetic chain and parietal pleura.&#xD;
           However, there are no studies regarding lumbar erector spinae plane block (LESP block)&#xD;
           block.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Since 1960 total hip arthroplasty has become one of the most frequent surgeries in the&#xD;
           world, due to its technical revolution with improved quality of life of patients with&#xD;
           osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis and proximal femur fractures, for example. However,&#xD;
           it is a surgery with high postoperative pain potential, and more attention should be&#xD;
           paid to postoperative analgesia, since patients undergoing this type of surgery are&#xD;
           usually older patients with multiple comorbidities, more sensitive to adverse effects of&#xD;
           systemic analgesic drugs (anti-inflammatory drugs, opioids). In addition, pain may lead&#xD;
           to hypomobility, which increases the risk of thromboembolic complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
           There are multiple forms of postoperative analgesia for total hip arthroplasty, such as&#xD;
           subarachnoid morphine, femoral, obturator and lateral femoral cutaneous nerve block,&#xD;
           lumbar plexus block, continuous epidural block, and &quot;3 in 1&quot; block, for example. still&#xD;
           considered as the gold standard analgesia for such surgery, intrathecal morphine has&#xD;
           some adverse effects as burden: pruritus, urinary retention, nausea and vomiting.The &quot;3&#xD;
           in 1&quot; block has a considerable incidence of partial failure, despite being an unique&#xD;
           injection block. Blockade of the lateral femoral obturator, obturator, and nerve nerves&#xD;
           requires 3 injections and a larger volume of local anesthetic.The epidural technique has&#xD;
           the advantage of allowing the use of a long-term epidural catheter, with or without an&#xD;
           analgesia-controlled device. (PCA), but in these more fragile patients with multiple&#xD;
           comorbidities it may lead to hypotension or limited ambulation due to concomitant use of&#xD;
           anticoagulant medications. Lumbar plexus block is a deep block, with greater risk of&#xD;
           complications (retroperitoneal hematoma, deep bleeding), of greater technical&#xD;
           difficulty, and erratic local anesthetic dispersion.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The LESP block emerged, based on the same principle as the ESP block in the thoracic&#xD;
           region. So far, to the best of our knowledge, there are only a few case reports that&#xD;
           evidence its use for hip surgery analgesia. It has potential advantages: ease of&#xD;
           execution, low risk of nerve damage and safety in patients with coagulopathies or on&#xD;
           anticoagulants. In our service, the investigators have 01 case report presented as a&#xD;
           free theme in congress that also describes a good individual effectiveness .&#xD;
&#xD;
           Recent reports have demonstrated lumbar-level ESP block (LESP) for hip and proximal&#xD;
           femur surgery, showing good results in postoperative pain control. One of the first&#xD;
           works on lumbar ESP block was a letter to the editor in Tulgar et al's Journal of&#xD;
           Clinical Anesthesia, which then began a trial comparing LESP with lumbar square, a work&#xD;
           still in progress.&#xD;
&#xD;
           With the growing interest of anesthesiologists in ESP block, several studies and case&#xD;
           reports have been written in different blockade applications, but the literature lacks&#xD;
           cadaveric studies to demonstrate more clearly the local anesthetic dispersion and&#xD;
           anatomically justify its clinical effectiveness. .&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. BACKGROUND Hip and proximal femur surgeries usually present with significant&#xD;
           postoperative pain, which may hinder patient movement and physiotherapy in the&#xD;
           postoperative period, besides immobility predisposing to the development of deep vein&#xD;
           thrombosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
           There are several ways of postoperative analgesia for this type of surgery, each having&#xD;
           its benefits and harms in relation to the other. This project aims to study the local&#xD;
           anesthetic dispersion in the blockade of the lumbar spine erector plane, in order to&#xD;
           apply it more safely and effectively as a new modality of analgesia for the hip and&#xD;
           proximal femur.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. OBJECTIVES 3.1. Primary objective The aim of this cadaveric study is to demonstrate the&#xD;
           dispersion of methylene blue dye solution when injected into the same anatomical space&#xD;
           targeted by the LESP block by anatomical dissection of the lumbar region of cadavers.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. HYPOTHESIS Lumbar erector spinae plane block (LESP) may provide effective postoperative&#xD;
           analgesia for hip and proximal femur surgery, comparable to other existing analgesic&#xD;
           modalities. A possible explanation for this is the local anesthetic dispersion injected&#xD;
           by this technique, which possibly reaches the posterior lumbar plexus branches.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. METHODS 5.1 Type of study and scenario An experimental, analytical and prospective study&#xD;
           will be conducted at the Capital Death Verification Service (SVOC) and at the Human&#xD;
           Anatomy Discipline Laboratory of the University of SÃ£o Paulo School of Medicine. After&#xD;
           approval by the Research Ethics Committee of the School of Medicine of the University of&#xD;
           SÃ£o Paulo, the inclusion of subjects for the study will be initiated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      5.2 Inclusion and exclusion criteria Fresh cadavers, age&gt; 18 years, height between 150cm and&#xD;
      190cm, any gender will be included.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Corpses with severe spinal deformity, known history of lumbar spine surgery, scars suggestive&#xD;
      of large anatomical manipulations of the lumbar region, and corpses with BMI&gt; 35 kg / mÂ² will&#xD;
      be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      5.3 Sample Calculation Eight cadavers will be used, with injections of solutions simulating&#xD;
      the LESP block, bilaterally, totaling 16 injections and dissections.&#xD;
&#xD;
      5.4 Experimental Design 20ml of 0.01% methylene blue solution (50mg of methylene blue diluted&#xD;
      in 0.9% saline 500ml) will be injected, simulating the LESP block technique: injection&#xD;
      between the transverse process of the fourth lumbar vertebra (L4) and the erector muscle of&#xD;
      the underlying spine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The injection will be performed with a Quincke 20G 100-150mm ultrasound-guided needle with a&#xD;
      low-frequency curvilinear transducer (4-8 MHz - SonoSite) in the plane between the transverse&#xD;
      process of L4 and the spinal erector muscle, bilaterally in each cadaver. by the same&#xD;
      operator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After injection of the solution the cadavers will be submitted to posterior lumbar region&#xD;
      dissection by an anatomist and analyzed the dispersion and impregnation of the blue solution.&#xD;
      The anatomical structures with the dye dispersion will be photographed and stored.&#xD;
