  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Ventricular tachycardia (VT) contributes to over 350,000 sudden deaths each year in the US.&#xD;
      Malignant VTs involve an electrical &quot;short circuit&quot; in the heart, formed by narrow channels&#xD;
      of surviving tissue inside myocardial scar. Current treatment for VT consists of either&#xD;
      implantable defibrillators (ICDs), suppressive drug therapy, catheter ablation or a&#xD;
      combination of all 3.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Implantable Defibrillators (ICDs) reduce sudden death and can terminate some ventricular&#xD;
      tachycardia (VT) without shocks, but they don't prevent VT. The occurrence of ≥1 ICD shock is&#xD;
      associated with reductions in mental well-being and physical functioning, and increases in&#xD;
      anxiety and sometimes depression. Further, ICD shocks have been consistently associated with&#xD;
      adverse outcomes, including heart failure and death. Furthermore, the most important&#xD;
      predictor of ICD shocks is a history of prior ICD shocks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therapies to suppress VT include antiarrhythmic drug therapy and catheter ablation, neither&#xD;
      however is universally effective. When VT recurs despite antiarrhythmic drug therapy and&#xD;
      catheter ablation, novel yet invasive, approaches may be required. Such invasive procedures&#xD;
      carry consequent risks of cardiac and extra-cardiac injury.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) is a non-invasive technique that delivers high doses of&#xD;
      radiation precisely to specified regions in the body, while minimizing exposure to adjacent&#xD;
      tissue. This technique is currently, and commonly used in the treatment of cancer.&#xD;
      Conventional application of SBRT has made use of its ability to spare non-target tissue,&#xD;
      including for treatment of tumors near the heart. More recently, clinicians have changed the&#xD;
      paradigm, by focusing radioablative energy on ventricular scar responsible for ventricular&#xD;
      tachycardia. Pre-clinical studies have supported the concept and were followed by&#xD;
      first-in-human VT therapeutic experience in 2017. Subsequent studies have had encouraging&#xD;
      results for patients who failed or were unable to tolerate conventional treatment.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This will be a single centre single arm prospective cohort study. 12 patients with&#xD;
      ventricular tachycardia will be recruited from those who have failed or were unable to&#xD;
      tolerate conventional therapy. These patients will be recruited from the cardiology clinic&#xD;
      where they will already be under the care of a heart rhythm/heart function specialist.&#xD;
      Clinical imaging data, medical history and previous ablation data will be collected and use&#xD;
      towards planning their treatment with SBRT. Patients will undergo further imaging (unless&#xD;
      recently done clinically), including: 4D cardiac CT (cCT), cardiac MRI (cMRI) and a planning&#xD;
      CT (pCT). MRIs will only be performed on patients with ICDs for whom it is considered safe to&#xD;
      do so. Using the imaging and electroanatomic substrate mapping data collected from a previous&#xD;
      ablation attempt, a volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT) treatment plan will be&#xD;
      established. This treatment plan will be generated in consultation between the cardiac&#xD;
      electrophysiologist, radiation oncologist and medical physicist; and will define the target&#xD;
      volume (TV) of myocardial tissue to be treated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once a TV has been established and verified, patients will be set up on a TrueBeam 1 linear&#xD;
      accelerator where the treatment will be administered. The actual time for treatment&#xD;
      administration is approximately 30 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the procedure, at 6 &amp; 12 weeks, 7.5 months then every 6 months, a follow-up will occur&#xD;
      as a part of standard care where outcome data regarding the chronic success of the ablation&#xD;
      procedure will be collected and ICD interrogation will be performed. No imaging or mapping is&#xD;
      planned at the follow-up. Patients will be followed for a minimum of 7.5 months to a maximum&#xD;
      of 2 years depending on when they are enrolled.&#xD;
