  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Dementia is widely prevalent and results in high direct and indirect health costs. Dementia&#xD;
      is associated with stress, anxiety, and depression in both patients and caregivers, and&#xD;
      caregiver burden is extremely common. Treatment protocols for patients and caregivers are&#xD;
      unclear and insufficient; drug treatments to manage behavioural and psychological symptoms of&#xD;
      dementia can yield serious negative side effects, and caregivers may not have access to&#xD;
      one-on-one psychotherapy due to high costs and long wait times. Yoga is an ancient Indian&#xD;
      mind-body practice that uses physical postures, breathing exercises, and meditation. Yoga may&#xD;
      be a viable therapeutic modality to address the psychological challenges associated with&#xD;
      dementia in patients and caregivers, as it has been shown to decrease stress and improve&#xD;
      anxiety and depressive symptoms in various populations. Recent research has suggested that&#xD;
      patients with dementia and their caregivers may also experience positive effects on their&#xD;
      mental health from practicing yoga. Furthermore, when yoga is taught in a gentle and mindful&#xD;
      manner, it is generally not associated with any negative side effects. While there is&#xD;
      preliminary data on dyadic exercise interventions for dementia patients and their caregivers,&#xD;
      to date no research has examined the effectiveness of a dyadic yoga intervention on stress,&#xD;
      anxiety, and depression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators propose an 8-week study of a dyadic chair yoga program for patients with&#xD;
      mild to moderate dementia and their caregivers (n = 30-40 participants). Our primary outcome&#xD;
      of interest is changes in perceived stress, while secondary outcomes include changes in&#xD;
      symptoms of depression and anxiety. The investigators will also look at the effects of the&#xD;
      chair yoga program on caregiver burden, quality of interactions, well-being, mindfulness, and&#xD;
      self-compassion. All outcomes will be assessed before the program starts and upon its&#xD;
      termination. Participants will attend a 1-hour weekly group yoga class (4-10 participants per&#xD;
      group) with their dyad for 8-weeks, and will also be given a video recording of a yoga class&#xD;
      to practice together at home as often as possible. The investigators hypothesize that after&#xD;
      the 8 week yoga program, patients and caregivers will report lower stress, as well as reduced&#xD;
      symptoms of anxiety and depression. Results will be available mid-2020.&#xD;

Scores on the PHQ-9 can range from 0-27, with higher scores indicating more severe depression.&#xD;
Hypothesis: Patients with dementia and their caregivers will report less severe symptoms of depression, as measured by the full version of the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), following participation in an 8-week gentle chair yoga program.</description>

Scores on the GAD-7 range from 0-21, with higher scores indicating more severe anxiety.&#xD;
Hypothesis: Patients with dementia and/or their caregivers will report fewer symptoms of anxiety, as measured by the Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-Item Scale (GAD-7), following participation in an 8-week gentle chair yoga program.</description>

Scores on the ZBI can range from 0-88, with higher scores corresponding to higher levels of burden.&#xD;
Hypothesis 1: Caregivers of patients with dementia will report lower caregiver burden, as measured by the Zarit Burden Scale (ZBI), following participation in an 8-week gentle chair yoga program.&#xD;
Hypothesis 2: Lower patient scores on the PHQ-9 and GAD-7 (week 8) will be associated with decreased caregiver burden following participation in an 8-week gentle chair yoga program.</description>

    <description>8-week dyadic chair yoga program for one hour per week. Chair yoga is an effective way to offer modified yoga postures and relaxation techniques to individuals with limited mobility and/or advanced age for whom mat-based classes may not be accessible. The weekly yoga classes will be lead by a certified instructor and will include 4-10 participants (or 2-5 patient-caregiver dyads).</description>
