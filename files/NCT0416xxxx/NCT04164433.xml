  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study seeks to determine whether workplace delivery of HIV self-testing will lead to an&#xD;
      increase in uptake of HIV testing and subsequent linkage to care or prevention services among&#xD;
      men in Uganda.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The current coverage of HIV testing and counseling in Uganda is 60% with only 34% of these&#xD;
      being men and only about 55% of males living with HIV know their status (MoH, 2016). The&#xD;
      challenges with HIV testing require a new focus and new approaches to reach people with&#xD;
      undiagnosed HIV infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HIV self-testing (HIVST) is one such innovative approach to making testing more accessible to&#xD;
      several under-served populations such as men and key populations (WHO, 2013).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this regard, this study seeks to determine whether providing HIVST in workplace settings&#xD;
      will increase the uptake of HIV testing services among men employed in private security&#xD;
      services in Uganda and improve linkage to treatment and prevention services.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: Cluster randomized trial in two Ugandan districts&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants: Male employees of private security companies&#xD;
