  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase 1 study of atezolizumab in combination with D2C7-IT, a dual-specific&#xD;
      monoclonal antibody (mAB) with a high affinity for both EGFRwt- and EGFRvIII-expressing&#xD;
      cells, in patients with recurrent World Health Organization (WHO) grade IV malignant glioma&#xD;
      at the Preston Robert Tisch Brain Tumor Center (PRTBTC) at Duke.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Approximately eighteen patients with recurrent WHO grade IV malignant glioma will receive&#xD;
      atezolizumab and D2C7-IT to determine the impact of the combination of D2C7-IT and&#xD;
      atezolizumab on safety. D2C7-IT will be delivered intratumorally by Convection Enhanced&#xD;
      Delivery (CED) using an intracerebral catheter placed within the enhancing portion of the&#xD;
      tumor. The dose of D2C7-IT was reduced from 6920 ng/mL to 4613.2 ng/mL after the first 4&#xD;
      patients as a precaution due to safety events experienced by these 4 patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Atezolizumab will be administered according to the FDA-approved dosing schedule of 1200 mg&#xD;
      intravenously every 3 weeks, beginning ~2 weeks after the D2C7-IT infusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Toxicity will be carefully monitored for each patient while they are on study for at least a&#xD;
      year after D2C7-IT treatment or for at least 30 days after the final dose of atezolizumab if&#xD;
      the patient continues atezolizumab on-study for longer than a year post-D2C7-IT. Of&#xD;
      particular interest will be the incidence of adverse events that occur during the first 28&#xD;
      days after D2C7-IT treatment and the inflammatory events that occur during the first year&#xD;
      after D2C7-IT treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The most common risks associated with D2C7-IT are effects related to tumor necrosis,&#xD;
      neurologic changes (including changes in function, new or increased seizures, swelling of the&#xD;
      brain, and injury to blood vessels), effects related to catheter placement or removal, and&#xD;
      effects related to fluid infusion into the brain. The most common risks associated with&#xD;
      atezolizumab are fatigue, decreased appetite, diarrhea, and nausea. Because atezolizumab&#xD;
      works with the immune system, it can cause the immune system to attack normal organs or&#xD;
      tissue and affect how they work.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have a recurrent supratentorial WHO grade IV malignant glioma based on&#xD;
             imaging studies&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prior histopathology confirmed recurrent supratentorial WHO grade IV malignant glioma&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient or partner(s) meets one of the following criteria:&#xD;

                  of becoming pregnant, including any female who is post-menopausal or surgically&#xD;
                  sterile, or any male who has had a vasectomy). Surgically sterile females are&#xD;
                  defined as those with a documented hysterectomy and/or bilateral oophorectomy or&#xD;
                  tubal l ligation. Postmenopausal for purposes of this study is defined as 1 year&#xD;
                  without menses; or,&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Childbearing potential and agrees to use one of the following methods of birth&#xD;
                  control: approved hormonal contraceptives that do not contain estrogen (e.g.,&#xD;
                  birth control pills, patches, implants, or infusions), an intrauterine device, or&#xD;
                  a barrier method of contraception (e.g., a condom or diaphragm) used with&#xD;
                  spermicide.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Platelet count ≥ 100,000/µl unsupported is necessary for eligibility on the study;&#xD;
             however, because of risks of intracranial hemorrhage with catheter placement, platelet&#xD;
             count ≥ 125,000/µl is required for the patient to undergo biopsy and catheter&#xD;
             insertion, which can be attained with the help of platelet transfusion&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Neutrophil count ≥ 1000 cells/mm3 prior to biopsy&#xD;

             Syndrome or patient has suspected Gilbert's Syndrome, for which additional lab testing&#xD;
             of direct and/or indirect bilirubin supports this diagnosis. In these instances, a&#xD;
             total bilirubin of ≤ 3.0 x ULN is acceptable.)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  AST (aspartate aminotransferase)/ALT (alanine aminotransferase) ≤ 2.5 x ULN prior to&#xD;
             biopsy&#xD;

             with prior history of thrombosis/embolism are allowed to be on anticoagulation,&#xD;
             understanding that anticoagulation will be held in the perioperative period per the&#xD;
             neurosurgical team's recommendations. Low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) is&#xD;
             preferred. If a patient is on warfarin, the international normalized ratio (INR) is to&#xD;
             be obtained and value should be below 2.0 prior to biopsy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  At the time of biopsy, prior to administration of D2C7-IT, the presence of recurrent&#xD;
             tumor must be confirmed by histopathological analysis&#xD;
