      To investigate the effects of an individualized nutritional intervention programs (iNIPs) on&#xD;
      nutritional status and readmission rate in older adults with pneumonia during hospitalization&#xD;
      and 3 and 6 months after discharge.&#xD;

      Method: Eighty-two malnourished older adults with primary diagnosis of pneumonia&#xD;
      participated. Patients were randomly allocated to either a nutrition intervention (NI) group&#xD;
      or a standard care (SC) group. Participants in the NI group received an iNIP according to&#xD;
      energy and protein intake requirements in addition to dietary advice based on face-to-face&#xD;
      interviews with their family members during hospitalization. After discharge, phone calls are&#xD;
      adopted for prescribing iNIPs. Anthropometry (i.e., body mass index, limb circumference, and&#xD;
      subcutaneous fat thickness), blood parameters (i.e., albumin and total lymphocyte count),&#xD;
      hospital stay, Mini-Nutritional Assessment-Short Form (MNA-SF) score, target daily calorie&#xD;
      intake, total calorie intake adherence rate, and three-major-nutrient intake were assessed&#xD;
      during hospitalization and 3 and 6 months after discharge. Both groups received regular&#xD;
      follow-up through phone calls. Furthermore, the rate of readmission resulting from pneumonia&#xD;
      was recorded after discharge.&#xD;
