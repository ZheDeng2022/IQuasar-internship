  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to determine, in patients with grade 1 degenerative&#xD;
      spondylolisthesis with spinal stenosis, if decompression and lumbar spinal fusion with, or&#xD;
      without supplementary pedicle screw fixation yields an improved patient reported outcome.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Lumbar spinal stenosis (LSS) is a common disease with a large impact on the quality of life&#xD;
      of the patient. LSS is defined as narrowing of the spinal canal, nerve root canal or&#xD;
      intervertebral foramina. Spinal stenosis is caused by degenerative changes in the lumbar&#xD;
      spine, including thickening of the ligamentum flavum, osteophyte formation and disc&#xD;
      protrusion. Pain is worse with standing upright and with exercise, and relieved with spine&#xD;
      flexion or sitting down.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the Wakayama Spine Study, investigators found radiographic severe spinal stenosis, defined&#xD;
      as narrowing of more than two-thirds of the spinal canal area, in 30,4% of all patients, but&#xD;
      only 17,5% were symptomatic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Many of the patients suffering from LSS are pensioners, with an average age of 65 years. With&#xD;
      current changes in demographics and the aging global population it is estimated that&#xD;
      prevalence of LSS will increase to nearly 60% by 2025.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a Danish epidemiological study, degenerative spondylolisthesis was found in 2,7% of men&#xD;
      and 8,4% of women above 50 years. Every year, more than 3500 patients aged 60 and above are&#xD;
      referred to Center of Spine Surgery Middelfart for LSS. According to the national Danish&#xD;
      surgical spine database, DaneSpine, 7936 patients with LSS had surgery during a period from&#xD;
      2009-2013.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients suffering from LSS and instability are treated with decompression and posterolateral&#xD;
      spinal fusion with or without instrumentation. According to DaneSpine, this group of patients&#xD;
      showed improvements on both physical and psychological parameters. In countries outside of&#xD;
      Scandinavia, these patients are usually treated with decompression and posterolateral spinal&#xD;
      fusion with supplementary pedicle screw fixation. Instrumentation with pedicle screws and&#xD;
      rods provides an internal splint, preventing motion during fusion healing. The fusion rate in&#xD;
      non-instrumented arthrodesis is reported to be as low as 30-45% In contrast the fusion rate&#xD;
      with instrumented arthrodesis have been reported to be above 80%. Although some studies have&#xD;
      shown similar outcomes after decompression with or without instrumentation, long-term follow&#xD;
      up has shown that a solid fusion improves clinical outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In recent retrospective studies, the spinal sagittal balance, specifically the sagittal&#xD;
      vertical axis (SVA) has been shown to affect the outcome of patients undergoing laminectomy.&#xD;
      Decompression surgery has been shown to improve sagittal balance in patients with a&#xD;
      preoperative imbalance, compared to patients treated with rehabilitation. The preoperative&#xD;
      sagittal imbalance has not been shown to significantly affect health-related quality of&#xD;
      life(HRQoL)outcomes although a residual imbalance after decompression is related to a poorer&#xD;
      outcome. No prospective studies to our knowledge have compared the sagittal balance and&#xD;
      outcomes in patients with spinal stenosis and spondylolisthesis, treated with decompression&#xD;
      and spinal fusion with or without supplemental pedicle screw fixation.&#xD;
