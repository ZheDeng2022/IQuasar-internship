  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Duke ApoL1 Nephropathy Biorepository aims to address needs within non-diabetic kidney&#xD;
      failure research by utilizing existing and, when necessary, developing new infrastructure to&#xD;
      support the consent of patients and the collection of dedicated samples for ApoL1 Nephropathy&#xD;
      biorepository.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The mutations in ApoL1 gene that are strongly associated with kidney disease are only present&#xD;
      in individuals of recent African ancestry (i.e., black people). Caucasians do not have these&#xD;
      ApoL1 mutations nor the associated kidney disease. Therefore, majority of subjects recruited&#xD;
      for this study will be self-identified African Americans, Afro-Caribbean and other black&#xD;
      individual. Study subjects will include individuals with end stage kidney disease and those&#xD;
      without any clinical evidence of kidney disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additionally, healthy black adults with no known history of kidney disease will be recruited&#xD;
      as controls in this study because they are the only group that can fill this role.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The risk of end stage kidney failure among African Americans is 4 times that of Caucasian&#xD;
      Americans. This excess risk of kidney failure is largely attributable to mutations in&#xD;
      apolipoprotein L1 gene. While 10-15% of African Americans in the United States possess kidney&#xD;
      disease-associated ApoL1 mutations, nearly 40% of African Americans on dialysis have these&#xD;
      mutations. There are significant gaps in the understanding of the pathophysiology of&#xD;
      ApoL1-nephropathy. Only some of the people with ApoL1 mutations develop kidney failure. The&#xD;
      pathways that link ApoL1 mutations with end stage kidney failure are not understood. Because&#xD;
      kidney biopsy is generally obtained from patients with evidence of kidney disease-whose&#xD;
      kidneys have experienced significant damage and sclerosis-access to the relevant kidney cells&#xD;
      is very limited. However, recent advancements in biomedical research have made it possible to&#xD;
      develop kidney-like cells from inducible pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) which were derived&#xD;
      from blood cells of individuals. This innovative technique will allow us to generate&#xD;
      iPSC-derived cells from the blood of individuals who have developed ApoL1-nephropathy for the&#xD;
      purpose studying them in research lab so as to decipher the cellular mechanism of their&#xD;
      kidney failure.&#xD;

      Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) will be isolated from the blood using standard&#xD;
      Ficoll-Paque technique. A fraction of the PBMCs will be cryopreserved and stored at for&#xD;
      future analysis. We will submit a separate IRB protocol for use of future unspecified&#xD;
      research with these samples. The remaining fraction of PBMCs will be used to generate&#xD;
      inducible pluripotentent stem cells (iPSCs). These iPSC would be differentiated into kidney&#xD;
      cells which could then be further studied. While no plans exist to immortalize any of these&#xD;
      cell lines, the consent form does allow for creating immortalized cell lines in the future.&#xD;
      Residual plasma will also be stored separately for additional analysis. Kidney cells shed&#xD;
      into urine would also be a potential source of iPSCs.&#xD;

        Mutation in ApoL1 gene is associated with increased risk of non-diabetic kidney disease in&#xD;
        individuals of recent African descent-i.e., only black people are affected. Therefore,&#xD;
        black adult cases with non-diabetic nephropathy or healthy controls aged 18 years or older&#xD;
        will be recruited for consent into the DANB.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Caucasians do not have these ApoL1 mutations nor the associated kidney disease. Therefore,&#xD;
        majority of subjects recruited for this study will be self-identified African Americans,&#xD;
        Afro-Caribbean and other black individual. Study subjects will include individuals at&#xD;
        various stages of kidney disease and those without any clinical evidence of kidney disease.&#xD;
