      The purpose of this study is to find the highest dose of a new drug, in combination with&#xD;
      standard drugs, which can be tolerated without causing very severe side effects. The study&#xD;
      treatment is new agents in combination with R-GDP or an equivalent regimen.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To find the highest dose of a new drug that can be tolerated without causing severe side&#xD;
      effects when receiving R-GDP or an equivalent regimen. This is done by starting at a dose&#xD;
      lower than the one that is tolerated in patients when given on its own. Participants are&#xD;
      given the new drug together with R-GDP and are watched very closely to see what side effects&#xD;
      they have and to make sure the side effects are not severe. If the side effects are not&#xD;
      severe, then new participants will be given a higher dose of the new drug. Participants&#xD;
      joining the study later on will get higher doses of the new drug than participants who join&#xD;
      earlier. This will continue until a dose is found that causes severe but temporary side&#xD;
      effects. Doses higher than that will not be given.&#xD;

             anticancer therapy for other advanced or metastatic malignancies are not eligible, as&#xD;

             potential for drug-drug interactions. Consult CCTG for patients who are on adjuvant&#xD;
             therapies after curative surgery or in instances where it is felt the patient may be&#xD;
             eligible (for example, TCC bladder receiving local therapies or CLL not requiring&#xD;
             active therapy).&#xD;
&#xD;

             of the treating physician, makes it undesirable for the patient to participate in the&#xD;
             study or which could jeopardize compliance with study requirements including, but not&#xD;
             limited to: ongoing or active infection, significant uncontrolled hypertension, or&#xD;
             severe psychiatric illness/social situations.&#xD;
