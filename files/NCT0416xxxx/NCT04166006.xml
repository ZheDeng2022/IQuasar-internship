    <textblock>
      Single-arm, monocentric trial to assess safety and immunological efficacy of adjuvant&#xD;
      vaccination with autologous dendritic cells loaded with autologous tumour homogenate after&#xD;
      curative resection for stage IV rare cancers (In Head/Neck tumors (H&amp;N), NEuroendocrine&#xD;
      Tumors (NET) and Soft Tissue Sarcomas (STS).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-arm, multi-cohort phase II study, to evaluate the immunological&#xD;
      effectiveness and safety of adjuvant Dendritic Cell (DC) vaccination. The evaluation of&#xD;
      immunological efficacy will be expressed as the number of patients who show enhancement of&#xD;
      the proportion of circulating immune effectors specific for a selected panel of associated&#xD;
      antigens for each disease (HNSCC, NET and STS). To avoid unacceptable toxicity, a formal&#xD;
      safety analysis will be conducted after six patients have been observed (two for each&#xD;
      disease) for at least 30 days after the third treatment cycle. If two or more patients have&#xD;
      experienced grade 3 or higher adverse events, enrollment will be definitively stopped;&#xD;
      differently, other 15 patients for each disease will be enrolled and evaluation of primary&#xD;
      objectives will be done for each cohort separately (H&amp;N, STS and NET).&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Patients must have histologically confirmed stage IV Head&amp;Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma&#xD;
             (HNSCC), NeuroEndocrine Tumors (NET) or Soft Tissue Sarcoma (STS) surgically treated&#xD;
             with radical intent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. The autologous surgical specimen must have been collected and sent to the Somatic Cell&#xD;
             Therapy Lab and must fulfil all the acceptance criteria prescribed by the Good&#xD;
             Manufactory Practice (GMP) procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. The patient must be disease-free, as assessed by CT scan or MRI of the chest, abdomen,&#xD;
             pelvis performed within 60 days before enrolment. If the resected lesions occurred in&#xD;
             other sites, these must be also included in the baseline CT scan and in all the&#xD;
             subsequent evaluations.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Patients disease-free candidates for only observation as per clinical practice (no&#xD;
             standard treatment is available after surgery)&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. The patient must have recovered from all the adverse events related to previous&#xD;
             surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;

                  upper institutional reference level.&#xD;
&#xD;
               6. Total bilirubin &lt;1.5 times the upper institutional reference level.&#xD;
&#xD;
               7. Serum creatinine &lt;1.5 times the upper institutional reference level.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Patients aged 70 years or older must have left ventricular ejection fraction not lower&#xD;
             than 55% as assessed by echocardiography.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Female patients of childbearing potential and all male patients must accept and be&#xD;
             compliant with an highly effective contraceptive method (i.e. with a failure rate of&#xD;
             &lt;1% per year: double barrier method, one barrier method plus spermicidal, intrauterine&#xD;
             device, or oral contraception) from informed consent signature and up to three months&#xD;
             after end of study. For this purpose are considered of childbearing potential all&#xD;
             female subjects after puberty unless they are post-menopausal for at least two years&#xD;
             or are surgically sterile. Complete abstinence from sexual intercourses is acceptable&#xD;
             if patients' lifestyle guarantees his/her strict compliance with this prescription in&#xD;
             the judgement of the Investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. The patient is willing and able to give written informed consent for the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Patients with residual disease after surgery. Marginal resection of any lesion in the&#xD;
             absence of clinically evident residual disease is acceptable.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Patient who completed surgery more than 90 days before study enrolment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. History of other neoplastic diseases in the previous 5 years, except basal cell&#xD;
             carcinoma of the skin and in situ carcinoma of the cervix uteri treated with curative&#xD;
             surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. History of congenital or acquired immunodeficiency, including history of organ&#xD;
             transplantation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Any positivity for the serologic markers of hepatitis B virus (HBV) (including at&#xD;
             least anti- Hepatitis B surface antibodies (HBs) and hepatitis B core (HBc)&#xD;
             antibodies, hepatitis C virus (HCV), HIV or Treponema pallidum. The serologic tests&#xD;
             must have been performed within 30 days before any GMP-regulated activity (i.e.&#xD;
             surgical resection and leukapheresis). The sole positivity for antibodies against the&#xD;
             HBV surface antigen (i.e.&#xD;
&#xD;
             with all other HBV markers negative) is indicative of previous HBV vaccination and&#xD;
             therefore is acceptable.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Female patients who are pregnant or nursing.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Participation in another clinical trial with any investigational agent within 30 days&#xD;
             prior to study screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Any active inflammatory or autoimmune disease requiring systemic steroids or other&#xD;
             immunomodulatory agents as detailed in section 6.4, or potentially requiring such&#xD;
             treatments during the study treatment in the judgement of the Investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Any clinical condition that, in the opinion of the Investigator or the Transfusion&#xD;
             Medicine specialist, is a contraindication to leukapheresis. In addition, all patients&#xD;
             aged 70 or older must be evaluated by a cardiology specialist before the procedure to&#xD;
             exclude any clinically relevant cardiac condition and any grade 3-4 cardiac&#xD;
             arrhythmia, even if asymptomatic.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Any uncontrolled serious intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing&#xD;
             or active infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris,&#xD;
             cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations potentially impacting&#xD;
             patient safety and compliance in the opinion of the Investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Refusal of giving written informed consent.&#xD;
