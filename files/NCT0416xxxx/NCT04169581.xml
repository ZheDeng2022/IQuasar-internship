    <textblock>
      This study aims to use radiomics analysis and deep learning approaches for seizure focus&#xD;
      detection in pediatric patients with temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE). Ten positron emission&#xD;
      tomograph (PET) radiomics features related to pediatric temporal bole epilepsy are extracted&#xD;
      and modelled, and the Siamese network is trained to automatically locate epileptogenic zones&#xD;
      for assistance of diagnosis.&#xD;

      Purpose:The key to successful epilepsy control involves locating epileptogenic focus before&#xD;
      treatment. 18F-FDG PET has been considered as a powerful neuroimaging technology used by&#xD;
      physicians to assess patients for epilepsy. However, imaging quality, viewing angles, and&#xD;
      experiences may easily degrade the consistency in epilepsy diagnosis. In this work, the&#xD;
      investigators develop a framework that combines radiomics analysis and deep learning&#xD;
      techniques to a computer-assisted diagnosis (CAD) method to detect epileptic foci of&#xD;
      pediatric patients with temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) using PET images.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:Ten PET radiomics features related to pediatric temporal bole epilepsy are first&#xD;
      extracted and modelled. Then a neural network called Siamese network is trained to quanti-fy&#xD;
      the asymmetricity and automatically locate epileptic focus for diagnosis.The performance of&#xD;
      the proposed framework was tested and compared with both the state-of-art clinician software&#xD;
      tool and human physicians with different levels of experiences to validate the accuracy and&#xD;
      consistency.&#xD;
