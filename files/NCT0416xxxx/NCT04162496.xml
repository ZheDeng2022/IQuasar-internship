    <textblock>
      Subjects with grades ranging from 1---3 on the Transverse Neck Line Scale, will be randomized&#xD;
      to receive up to 1cc of Restylane Refyne on one side of their neck utilizing a cannula and up&#xD;
      to 1cc of Restylane Refyne on the other side utilizing a 30--gauge needle. On Day 30, this&#xD;
      treatment with the same left---right assignment can be repeated if optimal correction on&#xD;
      either side has not been achieved according to the treating investigator. Subjects will&#xD;
      return 24--48 hours after their first treatment, to fill out questionnaires, take pictures,&#xD;
      and to be assessed by blinded evaluators regarding adverse events. Subjects will also return&#xD;
      30 days after their final treatment to fill out final questionnaires, take pictures, and to&#xD;
      be assessed by blinded evaluators regarding improvement of static rhytides.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This will be a prospective, evaluator-blinded, split--neck, clinical study in which patients&#xD;
      will be randomized to 2 groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first group will receive up to 1cc of Restylane Refyne into the rhytides on the right&#xD;
      side of the neck utilizing a 27---gauge cannula, while the left side will be injected with a&#xD;
      sharp 30--gauge needle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The second group will be reversed with the left side treated with Restylane Refyne utilizing&#xD;
      a cannula and the right side treated with a sharp needle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both groups will be utilizing the same safety and comfort protocols established by the&#xD;
      practice which include the use of topical numbing cream (B.L.T.), cleansing with alcohol, and&#xD;
      a cold ice pack at the site of injection after the procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before and after the procedure a set of blinded evaluators will be grading the subjects'&#xD;
      static horizontal neck lines using a validated 5--point grading scale. The blinded evaluators&#xD;
      will also be grading the subjects side effects such as bruising and swelling 24---48 hours&#xD;
      after the first treatment. A second treatment is allowed on Day 30 for those who have not&#xD;
      achieved optimal correction. Either on Day 30 or Day 60, a final assessment with digital&#xD;
      photography using Canfield's Vectra imaging system, along with a patient questionnaire on&#xD;
      satisfaction, improvement (GAIS), side effects, and pain levels during and after the&#xD;
      procedure will also be recorded.&#xD;
