  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase I/II trial studies the side effects and best dose of venetoclax when given&#xD;
      together with azacitidine in treating patients with high-risk myelodysplastic syndrome that&#xD;
      has come back (recurrent) or does not respond to treatment (refractory). Drugs used in&#xD;
      chemotherapy, such as venetoclax and azacitidine, work in different ways to stop the growth&#xD;
      of cancer cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping&#xD;
      them from spreading.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the safety and tolerability (phase 1) and overall response rate (ORR) (phase&#xD;
      2) of venetoclax in combination with azacitidine in patients with treatment-naive high-risk&#xD;
      myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) or chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) with bone marrow&#xD;
      excess blasts &gt; 5% and patients that are relapsed/refractory to prior hypomethylating agent&#xD;
      (HMA) therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Rate of complete remission (CR). II. Rate of marrow/morphologic complete remission (mCR).&#xD;
      III. Rate of hematologic improvement (HI; erythroid/platelet/neutrophil responses).&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. Rate of red blood cell (RBC) transfusion independence. V. Rate of platelet (PLT)&#xD;
      transfusion independence. VI. Rate of cytogenetic response. VII. Rate of bone marrow blast&#xD;
      response. VIII. Time to transformation to acute myeloid leukemia (AML). IX. Duration of&#xD;
      response (DOR). X. Overall survival (OS). XI. Progression-free survival (PFS). XII. Time to&#xD;
      next MDS treatment (TTNT). XIII. Event-free survival (EFS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To investigate the effects of therapy on MDS and to identify biological markers of&#xD;
      response to venetoclax and/or its combination with azacitidine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose-escalation study of venetoclax followed by a phase II study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive venetoclax orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-7 or 1-14 and azacitidine&#xD;
      subcutaneously (SC) or intravenously (IV) over 15 minutes on days 1-5. Cycles repeat every&#xD;
      4-8 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days and then every 3-6&#xD;
      months for up to 5 years.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Signed written informed consent&#xD;

             childbearing potential must agree to use an adequate method of contraception during&#xD;
             the study and until 3 months after the last treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Males must be surgically or biologically sterile or agree to use an adequate method of&#xD;
             contraception during the study until 3 months after the last treatment&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Patients having received any prior BCL2 inhibitor therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
