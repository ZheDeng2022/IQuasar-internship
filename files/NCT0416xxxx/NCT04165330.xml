      This study evaluates the safety and efficacy of AL3818 (anlotinib) hydrochloride in&#xD;
      combination with Opdivo (nivilumab) for the treatment patients with of metastatic, advanced,&#xD;
      or recurrent solid tumors. All participants will receive open-label AL3818 with nivolumab.&#xD;
      Part 1 consists of a dose finding phase to determine the recommended phase 2 dosage of AL3818&#xD;
      with nivolumab. Part 2 consists of a dose expansion phase, evaluating the safety and efficacy&#xD;
      of the combination in patients cohorts including metastatic, advanced, or recurrent soft&#xD;
      tissue sarcomas, non-small cell lung cancer, and small cell lung cancer.&#xD;

      This phase 1b/2 study evaluates the safety and efficacy of AL3818 (anlotinib) hydrochloride&#xD;
      in combination with Opdivo (nivilumab) for the treatment patients with of metastatic,&#xD;
      advanced, or recurrent solid tumors including soft tissue sarcomas (STS), non-small cell lung&#xD;
      cancer (NSCLC), and small cell lung cancer (SCLC). All participants will receive open-label&#xD;
      AL3818 with nivolumab on a scheduled basis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 1 (phase 1b) consists of a dose finding phase to determine the safety, tolerability&#xD;
      (including recommended phase 2 dosage (RP2D), and PK profile of AL3818 given with nivolumab.&#xD;
      Participants will receive oral AL3818 once daily on Days 1-14 and nivolumab injection on Day&#xD;
      1 and 15 of one 21-day cycle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 2 (phase 2a) consists of a dose expansion phase, to evaluate the safety and preliminary&#xD;
      efficacy of combination treatment using AL3818 at the RP2D determined from Part 1 together&#xD;
      with nivolumab injection at standard dosing for patients with metastatic, advanced, or&#xD;
      recurrent STS, NSCLC, or SCLC in 21-day cycles. Oral AL3818 will be given on Days 1-14 days&#xD;
      and nivolumab will be given every 2 weeks, for up to 24 cycles of total AL3818 therapy.&#xD;
