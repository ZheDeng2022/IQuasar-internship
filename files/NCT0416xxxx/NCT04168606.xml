      Cases with placental abruption will be identified by interrogation of two databases of Brest&#xD;
      University Hospital between January 2013 and December 2018. First trimester PAPPA and bhCG&#xD;
      levels will be recorded. PlGF levels will be measured in women with an available first&#xD;
      trimester serum sample. Histological findings in placentas, course of pregnancies, maternal&#xD;
      and fetal characteristics will described and compared between cases with and without&#xD;
      placental chronic inflammation.&#xD;

      Identification of cases:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Placental abruption cases will be identified by interrogation of two databases of Brest&#xD;
      University Hospital between January 2013 and December 2018.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The women diagnosed with placental abruption will be first identified by interrogation of the&#xD;
      Medical Registry Department (MRD) of Brest University Hospital and of five other maternities&#xD;
      of our county between January 2013 and December 2018, using the keyword &quot;placental&#xD;
      abruption&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Simultaneously, placental abruption cases will be identified from the Pathology department&#xD;
      files of Brest University Hospital using a computerized database (ADICAP system).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cases of placental abruption included in the study will be clinically defined and will not be&#xD;
      only diagnosed by histological examination. All cases will be reviewed by an experienced&#xD;
      obstetrician in order to confirm the diagnosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Duplicates, medical termination of pregnancy, marginal abruption, placenta previa, cases&#xD;
      without histological examination of the placenta, histological cases without compatible&#xD;
      clinical signs and cases from an unselected maternity will be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Women identified with placental abruption in the period of study will be sent an information&#xD;
      letter explaining the study and its purpose. Women who express their opposition to&#xD;
      participate to the study will be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical parameters:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following data will be recorded from medical files on a computerized database: baseline&#xD;
      maternal characteristics including preconceptional Body Mass Index (BMI), tobacco use, drug&#xD;
      use (cocaine, cannabis, buprenorphine) medical history (chronic hypertension, chronic&#xD;
      nephropathy, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, autoimmune disease, previous venous&#xD;
      thromboembolism), blood and rhesus group, obstetrical history, especially past&#xD;
      vasculoplacental disorder and past placental abruption, age at delivery. The following&#xD;
      pregnancy characteristics will also be collected: method of conception, medication during&#xD;
      pregnancy (in particular aspirin and low molecular-weight heparin (LMWH)), gestational&#xD;
      diabetes, premature rupture of membrane, pre-eclampsia (according to the American College of&#xD;
      Obstetricians and Gynecologists' definition published in 2013, term at pre-eclampsia&#xD;
      diagnosis, term at delivery and method of delivery, postpartum complications including&#xD;
      postpartum hemorrhage (defined by a blood loss &gt; 500 ml, whatever the mode of delivery),&#xD;
      disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIVC), thromboembolic event after delivery and before&#xD;
      hospital discharge, intensive care admission and length of stay.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following fetal characteristics will be recorded: presence and term at diagnosis of&#xD;
      intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR), stillbirth, birthweight and sex of the newborn. IUGR&#xD;
      will be defined according to the 2013 French College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists&#xD;
      guidelines by an estimated fetal weight below the 10th percentile using locally-accepted&#xD;
      curve (AUDIPOG) associated with signs of fetal growth pathological restriction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Placental parameters:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Histopathological examination of the placentas had been performed by two senior perinatal&#xD;
      pathologists at Brest University Hospital. Histological findings were recorded by&#xD;
      interrogation of the pathology computerized database APIX V7.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Placentas were fixed in 4% buffered formalin. Standard sampling of three blocks in the&#xD;
      central area was performed and slides were Hematoxylin, Eosin and Saffron (HES) stained.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recorded macroscopic findings will correspond to the following items: placenta weight,&#xD;
      fetoplacental weight ratio, placental abruption, abnormal placental set-up (only&#xD;
      circumvallation), abnormal umbilical cord (villamentous implantation, thin umbilical cord&#xD;
      with &lt; 0,8 cm in diameter, presence of a knot), presence and number of placental infarcts,&#xD;
      intervillous thrombi and thrombi in a vessel of the chorionic plate affecting ≥ one third of&#xD;
      the placental surface.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recorded microscopic lesions will correspond to the following items according to Amsterdam&#xD;
      consensus: maternal vascular malperfusion lesions such as microscopic infarcts, decidual&#xD;
      arteriopathy, abnormal villous maturation (hypermature villi or villous agglutination),&#xD;
      presence of fetal vascular malperfusion signs such as obliterative fetal vasculopathy or&#xD;
      avascular villi, chorangiosis and erythroblastosis, excessive fibrin deposition, chronic&#xD;
      inflammation such as villitis or chronic intervillositis of unknown etiology, chronic&#xD;
      chorioamniotitis or chronic deciduitis, acute inflammation such as acute villitis, acute&#xD;
      chorioamniotitis or funiculitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Biological parameters:&#xD;
&#xD;
      First trimester Down syndrome screening results will be collected for each pregnancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      First trimester pregnancy associated plasma protein-A (PAPP-A) and β-human chorionic&#xD;
      gonadotrophin (βhCG) levels had been measured in international unit/liter and converted to&#xD;
      multiples of the median (MoM) using the crown-rump length or biparietal diameter measurement&#xD;
      when the blood sample was obtained as an estimate of gestational age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Available blood samples collected at the end of first trimester of pregnancy (between 11&#xD;
      weeks of gestation (WG) and 13+6 WG) for Down syndrome screening stored at -20°C in&#xD;
      Biochemistry department of Brest University Hospital will be used for Placental Growth Factor&#xD;
      (PlGF) quantification. Measurements will be done with the automated B.R.A.H.M.S KRYPTOR&#xD;
      compact PLUS system (B.R.A.H.M.S PlGF plus KRYPTOR: Thermo Fisher Scientific, Hennigsdorf,&#xD;
      Berlin) according to the manufacturer's instructions described elsewhere. PlGF levels will be&#xD;
      expressed in pg/ml.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Informed written consents were obtained from women whose blood samples had been collected at&#xD;
      the end of first trimester.&#xD;
