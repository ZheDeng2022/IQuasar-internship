  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cancer immunotherapy has been largely adopted in oncology patient management in the last&#xD;
      decade. The deep and long responses to immunotherapy have accelerated the approval of these&#xD;
      drugs across multiple disease sites. However, these agents can also be toxic to patients,&#xD;
      meaning, the patient will have to discontinue treatment and outcomes could be negatively&#xD;
      affected. Recently, a combination of two immunotherapy drugs, ipilimumab and nivolumab&#xD;
      (ipi/nivo), has been approved for the treatment of intermediate and poor-risk renal cell&#xD;
      carcinoma (RCC) patients. This powerful combination provides survival benefit, however, it&#xD;
      can also be highly toxic leading to discontinuation of this treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There has been some evidence that these otherwise toxic drugs can be better tolerated by&#xD;
      altering the composition of the patients gut bacteria to create a more diverse and healthy&#xD;
      microbiome. The current study will involve Fecal Microbiota Transplantation (FMT) before the&#xD;
      start of the immunotherapy combination, and during the first two cycles of ipilimumab&#xD;
      treatment (the more toxic agent) as supportive therapy to prevent toxicity associated with&#xD;
      the ipi/nivo combination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goal of this project is to study the safety of such FMT combination treatment and reduce&#xD;
      occurrence of immune-related toxicities in patients, allowing them to continue their cancer&#xD;
      treatments in the hopes of a better outcome. The investigators will also be looking at&#xD;
      changes in the immune populations, microbiome profile of patients, response to treatment, and&#xD;
      patient survival as secondary objectives.&#xD;
