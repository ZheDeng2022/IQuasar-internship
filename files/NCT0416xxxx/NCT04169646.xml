  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Non-specific neck pain and headache are major economic and individual burdens in&#xD;
      office-workers. The aim of this study is to investigate the effect of a multi-component&#xD;
      intervention combining workstation ergonomics, health promotion information group workshops,&#xD;
      neck exercises, and an app to enhance intervention adherence to assess possible reductions in&#xD;
      the economic and individual burden of neck pain and headache in office workers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is a stepped wedge cluster-randomized controlled trial. Eligible participants will&#xD;
      be any office-worker aged 18-65 years from two Swiss organisations in the Canton of Zurich&#xD;
      and Canton of Aargau, working more than 25 hours a week in predominantly sedentary office&#xD;
      work and without serious health conditions of the neck. 120 voluntary participants will be&#xD;
      assigned to 15 clusters which, at randomly selected time steps, switch from the control to&#xD;
      the intervention group. The intervention will last 12 weeks and comprises workstation&#xD;
      ergonomics, health promotion information group workshops, neck exercises and an adherence&#xD;
      app. The primary outcome will be health-related productivity losses (presenteeism,&#xD;
      absenteeism) using the Work Productivity and Activity Impairment Questionnaire. Secondary&#xD;
      outcomes will include neck disability and pain. Physical and health outcomes (e.g. Neck&#xD;
      Disability Index, muscle strength, and endurance), psychosocial outcomes (e.g. job-stress&#xD;
      index, Fear-Avoidance Beliefs Questionnaire), workplace outcomes (e.g. workstation&#xD;
      ergonomics), and individual outcomes (e.g. socio-demographic data, adherence to intervention)&#xD;
      will be assessed. Measurements will take place at baseline, 4 months, 8 months, and 12 months&#xD;
      after commencement. Data will be analysed on an 'intention to treat' basis and per protocol.&#xD;
      Primary and secondary outcomes will be examined using linear mixed-effects models.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is the first that investigates the impact of a multi-component intervention&#xD;
      combining current evidence of effective interventions with an adherence app to assess the&#xD;
      potential benefits on productivity, neck pain, and headache. The outcomes will impact the&#xD;
      individual, their workplace, as well as private and public policy by offering evidence for&#xD;
      treatment and prevention of neck pain and headache in office-workers.&#xD;

    <measure>NP-related productivity loss</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, after 4 months, after 8 months, after 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>NP-related productivity loss (economic outcome) will be measured in percentages of the working time, using the Work Productivity and Activity Impairment Questionnaire for Specific Health Problem (German version) and converted into monetary units using individual earnings. Absenteeism is assessed by asking the participants about the number of hours missed because of NP as well as the number of hours they have actually worked. To assess presenteeism, the participants are asked to indicate on a 10-score scale how much the NP affected productivity while working, with 0 indicating no effect on productivity and 10 indicating total disability. Scoring rules of the developers of the questionnaire will then be used to obtain self-reported absenteeism and presenteeism expressed as impairment percentages. The monetary value for the lost productivity will be obtained for each individual by multiplying the impairment percentages by the individual gross wage.</description>

    <description>Participants' workstation ergonomics will be assessed using an observation-based ergonomics assessment checklist for office-workers adapted to Swiss guidelines. Based on the initial assessment, best practice ergonomics will be applied individually using existing infrastructure. Participants will attend health promotion information group workshops for approximately one hour per week for 12 weeks. it. Participants will receive an individual progressive exercise programme aimed at conditioning the muscles of the neck and shoulder girdle. The exercises will be performed in groups (maximum of ten per group) at the workplace in a dedicated room, for approximately one hour (3x20 minutes) per week; once per week supervised by a physiotherapist, a human movement scientist, or a health scientist, and twice per week individually. Workshop session attendance will be recorded as an indication of adherence to health promotion. Adherence to neck exercises will be recorded with the Physitrack® app.</description>
