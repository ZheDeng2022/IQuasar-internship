    <measure>Secondary Efficacy: Rutherford class</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The second secondary efficacy measurement is change in Rutherford class score at 3, 6 and 12 months. Rutherford score is a classification system for patients with peripheral vascular disease.&#xD;
Categories are numbered from 0 to 6, with 0 being asymptomatic, and 6 being major tissue loss, functional foot no longer salvageable. Higher values are therefore considered a worse outcome.&#xD;
Rutherford class zero: No symptoms; Rutherford class 1: Mild Claudication (minimal leg pain with ambulation) symptoms; Rutherford Class 2: Moderate Claudication (moderate leg pain with ambulation); Rutherford Class 3: Severe claudication (severe leg pain with ambulation); Rutherford Class 4: Ischemic Rest pain (leg pain at rest); Rutherford Class 5: Minor tissue loss (nonhealing ulcer, focal gangrene, diffuse pedal ischemia); Rutherford class 6: Major tissue loss (extending above the transmetatarsal TM level, functional foot no longer salvageable.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Secpndary Efficacy: Wound healing</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The third secondary efficacy endpoint is wound healing for subjects with Rutherford class 5 at 6 and 12 months, as assessed by the investigator using WIfI score and descriptive characteristics, including change in wound size measured by any decrease in wound surface area.&#xD;
The WIfI classification scoring system is a grading system using a composite score of wound (W), ischemia (I), and foot infection (fi). These three different categories are graded from 0 to 3 with 0 being the best and 3 being the worst.&#xD;
The total score will be provided (clinical stage 1-5), which is used to estimate the risk for major amputation at one year. Patients with a score of 1 are considered low risk, and patients with a score of 5 are considered high risk (foot not salvageable). Therefore, higher values are considered a worse outcome.&#xD;
The composite score is calculated by adding up the score from each category.</description>

      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Subject is willing and able to provide informed consent and able to comply with the&#xD;
             study protocol.&#xD;

&#xD;
          4. Subjects must have symptoms of limb ischemia, determined by clinical symptoms of&#xD;
             Rutherford class 3-5, including severe, life-limiting claudication (R 3), rest pain (R&#xD;
             4), and/or minor tissue loss (R5), that in the opinion of the investigator are not&#xD;
             amenable to conservative medical therapy and require endovascular intervention for&#xD;
             alleviation of symptoms and tissue preservation&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Stenotic, restenotic, or occlusive lesions located in the infrapopliteal vessels, with&#xD;
             target lesion that can be successfully crossed with a guidewire.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Target lesion must meet lesion-specific criteria in pre-screening by angiography at&#xD;
             time of procedure (prescreening with CTA, MRA or selective angiography may be&#xD;
             performed prior to the index procedure).&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Target vessel(s) reconstitute(s) at or above the ankle, with the target treated&#xD;
             segment extending no more than 10 mm beyond the ankle.&#xD;
&#xD;
             Note:&#xD;
&#xD;
             If the anterior tibial or posterior tibial arteries are treated, there must be inline&#xD;
             flow to the foot.&#xD;
&#xD;
             If the peroneal artery is treated, there must be at least one collateral supplying the&#xD;
             foot.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Target lesion must begin no higher than the tibial trifurcation (popliteal artery&#xD;
             excluded).&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Target vessel reference diameter is measured to be between 2.0 mm to 4.5 mm in&#xD;
             diameter, assessed by one of the following methods after successful completion of&#xD;
             guidewire crossing of the lesion site:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Intravascular Ultrasound (IVUS)&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT)&#xD;

&#xD;
         10. Lesion length must be &gt; 30 mm and &lt; 200 mm.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Only one limb may be enrolled per subject. Up to two vessels may be treated per&#xD;
             subject; if required, a second modality may be used for treatment in the non-target&#xD;
             infrapopliteal vessel. Any treatment of the non-index vessel must be performed prior&#xD;
             to the use of the investigative device and only one artery may be treated with the&#xD;
             investigative device&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. The treated segment is defined as the total length of artery treated with the&#xD;
             investigational device. Target treatment length is &lt;250 mm with a maximum segment of&#xD;
             200 mm separated by 30 mm of healthy tissue between treated lesions.&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. Successful pre-dilatation of the target lesion as outlined in the procedure&#xD;
             instructions, defined as resulting in stenosis &lt;50%, without resulting flow limiting&#xD;
             (Type D or greater) dissection, thrombus, or aneurysm by angiography prior to the&#xD;
             insertion of the investigative device.&#xD;
&#xD;
         14. Iliac, SFA and popliteal inflow lesions can be treated using standard angioplasty&#xD;
             and/or drug coated balloon and/or an approved stent (no atherectomy) during the index&#xD;
             procedure or &gt;30 days prior. Inflow lesions treated intraprocedure must be treated&#xD;
             first, prior to consideration of treatment of infrapopliteal lesions. If pre-screening&#xD;
             with duplex ultrasound, angiography, CTA, or MRA has been performed &lt; 365 days prior&#xD;
             to the procedure, intra-procedure angiography of the aorto-iliac vasculature is not&#xD;
             required, however, the femoropopliteal inflow must still be imaged using angiography&#xD;
             during the index procedure. Inflow lesions must have a healthy vessel segment of &gt;30&#xD;
             mm between the study lesion and the treated segment, defined as less than 50% stenosis&#xD;
             without aneurysmal segments.&#xD;
&#xD;
         15. Retrograde access (in the infrapopliteal arteries) is permitted for lesion crossing,&#xD;
             however, the Temporary Spur Stent System must be deployed from antegrade access.&#xD;
&#xD;
         16. For subjects with bilateral disease, planned treatment of the contralateral limb must&#xD;
             either be performed &gt;30 days prior to the index procedure or &gt; 14 days following the&#xD;
             index procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
