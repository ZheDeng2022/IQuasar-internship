  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Survival rates for cancer are increasing, resulting in more young adult cancer survivors&#xD;
      living with lingering side effects. Physical activity has been shown to improve the quality&#xD;
      and length of life in young adult cancer survivors; yet, few are active enough, and little is&#xD;
      currently being done to promote physical activity in this population. The investigators&#xD;
      developed a novel behaviour support intervention to promote physical activity in young adult&#xD;
      cancer survivors. In this two-arm pilot randomized controlled trial, the investigators aim&#xD;
      to: (1) assess trial and intervention feasibility, (2) assess trial and intervention&#xD;
      acceptability, and (3) generate data on physical activity behaviour. Young adult cancer&#xD;
      survivors will be randomized to receive either a 12-week behaviour support intervention&#xD;
      delivered via videoconferencing or will be allocated to usual care.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Background: Young adults commonly experience persistent side effects following cancer&#xD;
      treatment that impair quality of life. Physical activity (PA) holds promise as an&#xD;
      intervention to mitigate persistent side effects and improve quality of life. Yet, few young&#xD;
      adults are active enough to incur these benefits and efforts to promote PA following cancer&#xD;
      treatment are lacking. Therefore, the investigators developed a novel behaviour support&#xD;
      intervention to promote PA in young adults following cancer treatment, and have undertaken a&#xD;
      pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT) to determine whether the intervention delivered via&#xD;
      videoconferencing is both feasible and acceptable. Specifically, the aims of this ongoing&#xD;
      parallel group two-arm pilot RCT are to: (1) assess trial and intervention feasibility and&#xD;
      acceptability, and (2) generate data on PA behaviour.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: Young adults who have completed cancer treatment are recruited from across Canada.&#xD;
      Recruits are randomized to the intervention group (IG; i.e., a 12-week behaviour support&#xD;
      intervention delivered via videoconferencing) or usual care (UC; no intervention). Drawing on&#xD;
      the CONSORT 2010 statement and flow diagram, several feasibility outcomes pertaining to&#xD;
      enrolment, allocation, follow-up, and analysis are tracked by study staff. Acceptability is&#xD;
      assessed through interviews exploring IG and UC participants' experiences, thoughts, and&#xD;
      perspectives of the trial, IG participants' views of the intervention and its mode of&#xD;
      delivery, and PA counsellors' experiences delivering the intervention. PA is measured using&#xD;
      accelerometers. Assessments take place at baseline (pre-randomization), post-intervention&#xD;
      period, and at follow-up (24 weeks post-baseline).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Discussion: Feasibility and acceptability data will help determine if/what&#xD;
      changes/modifications are needed to improve the trial protocol and/or intervention, and will&#xD;
      inform the timeline for a definitive RCT. The PA behaviour data collected will inform sample&#xD;
      size calculation for a future RCT that aims to test the effects of this intervention in young&#xD;
      adults following cancer treatment.&#xD;

The SF-36 measures eight dimensions: physical functioning, bodily pain, role limitations due to physical health problems, role limitations due to personal or emotional problems, emotional well-being, social functioning, energy/fatigue, and general health perceptions. It also includes a single item that provides an indication of perceived change in health. Each item is scored on a 0 to 100 scale, with higher scores representing a more favourable health state.</description>

    <description>Change in participants' self-reported perceptions of cancer impact from baseline (week 0), post-intervention (week 12) and post-intervention follow-up (week 24).

    <description>Change in participants' self-reported motivation for physical activity across baseline (week 0), post-intervention (week 12) and post-intervention follow-up (week 24). This measure taps six behavioural regulations in the physical activity context: amotivation, external, introjected, identified, integrated, and intrinsic motivation. Each item is scored on a scale from 0 ('Not true for me') to 4 ('Very true for me'), with higher scores reflecting greater amotivation, external, introjected, identified, integrated, and intrinsic motivation for physical activity.</description>
