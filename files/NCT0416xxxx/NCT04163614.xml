  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Kidney failure has been recognized as one of the most costly chronic conditions among United&#xD;
      States Veterans. Approximately 13,000 Veterans develop kidney failure each year, and most&#xD;
      require hemodialysis initiation. Hemodialysis patients suffer significantly increased risk of&#xD;
      death and hospitalizations, and excessive body fluid is a major cause of this. While empiric&#xD;
      aggressive fluid removal during dialysis is one approach to limit fluid overload, this can&#xD;
      cause dangerous decreases in blood pressure during dialysis that independently contribute to&#xD;
      the high death rate. In this study, I aim to test a new strategy that prescribes fluid&#xD;
      removal based on a patient's recent blood pressure patterns during dialysis. This clinical&#xD;
      trial will compare my strategy to standard care and assess the outcomes of overall blood&#xD;
      pressure change between dialysis treatments in addition to the number of times the blood&#xD;
      pressure becomes dangerously low during dialysis. Another aim is to determine how differences&#xD;
      in the structure and function of the heart influence blood pressure during dialysis.&#xD;

      United States Veterans have disproportionately higher risk for end stage renal disease (ESRD)&#xD;
      compared to the general population. Veterans with ESRD on maintenance hemodialysis (HD)&#xD;
      suffer from alarmingly high mortality rates and hospitalizations mainly related to&#xD;
      cardiovascular disease. Extracellular volume (ECV) excess is a primary contributing factor to&#xD;
      cardiovascular disease and the heightened mortality rate in HD patients. Extracellular volume&#xD;
      excess remains difficult to identify in clinical practice, and the standard approach to fluid&#xD;
      management in the clinical setting involves arbitrary trial and error attempts to remove&#xD;
      fluid without invoking hemodynamic instability such as intradialytic hypotension.&#xD;
      Bioimpedance spectroscopy (BIS) is a useful research tool for assessing ECV; however, it is&#xD;
      not feasible in routine practice, and there is little data on how its use affects&#xD;
      intermediate and hard clinical outcomes. There is an unmet need for an approach to guide&#xD;
      ultrafiltration in clinical practice that addresses both reduction of ECV and other mortality&#xD;
      outcomes as well as minimization of intradialytic hypotension. The long-term goal of this&#xD;
      study is to develop a more precise, patient-specific fluid management approach to be tested&#xD;
      in a large clinical trial aimed at reducing mortality in Veterans on HD. The overall&#xD;
      objective of this project is to utilize the investigators' novel, patient-specific&#xD;
      ultrafiltration algorithm as an intervention in a clinical trial using mortality risk factors&#xD;
      as the primary outcomes. The central hypothesis is that prescribing ultrafiltration&#xD;
      prospectively based on an individual patient's intradialytic blood pressure slopes (IBPS)&#xD;
      from recent treatments is superior to standard care at reducing ambulatory blood pressure and&#xD;
      ECV without increasing risk for intradialytic hypotension. Aim 1 will use an un-blinded,&#xD;
      controlled randomized clinical trial to demonstrate the effects of an IBPS-based&#xD;
      ultrafiltration prescription compared to standard clinical practice. Each month, updated&#xD;
      ultrafiltration prescriptions for the IBPS group will be determined based on the most recent&#xD;
      treatment data. The primary outcome will be change in mean systolic 44-hour ambulatory blood&#xD;
      pressure after 4 months. Other outcomes will include 1) change in post-HD ECV/body weight&#xD;
      using multifrequency bioimpedance spectroscopy, 2) change in post-HD total peripheral&#xD;
      resistance index using a non-invasive cardiac output monitor, and 3) between-group comparison&#xD;
      of the frequency of intradialytic hypotension and intradialytic symptoms. Aim 2 will involve&#xD;
      a cross sectional analysis of baseline data of subjects from Aim 1 in addition to consecutive&#xD;
      enrollment of additional hypertensive HD patients. In addition to Aim 1 measurements,&#xD;
      subjects will undergo transthoracic echocardiograms on a non-HD day to obtain measurements of&#xD;
      left ventricular ejection fraction as a metric of systolic function, mitral inflow and mitral&#xD;
      annulus velocities as a metric of diastolic function, and left ventricular mass index. Mixed&#xD;
      linear models will be used to determine how these metrics independently influence the&#xD;
      association between ECV/body weight and IBPS. The strength of the association between IBPS&#xD;
      and ECV/body weight will then be determined within each tertile of the distributions of&#xD;
      systolic and diastolic dysfunction. Finally, there will be an assessment of how the&#xD;
      echocardiogram based metrics influence the likelihood of intradialytic hypotension with&#xD;
      prospective follow up while controlling for ECV/body weight. If successful, this study will&#xD;
      provide nephrologists with an easily-implemented, individualized approach to fluid management&#xD;
      in Veterans on HD that safely reduces ECV excess and related mortality risk factors. Because&#xD;
      no approach currently exits, this could immediately change clinical practice of managing&#xD;
      Veterans with ESRD. The long term impact will be the opportunity to utilize the data&#xD;
      generated to design a large, multi-center trial directly evaluating this intervention's&#xD;
      effect on mortality in Veterans with ESRD on HD. The observed reduction in blood pressure can&#xD;
      be used to determine expected mortality, while the echocardiogram data can be used to&#xD;
      determine phenotypes of patients that may need to be considered for inclusion/exclusion&#xD;
      criteria.&#xD;
