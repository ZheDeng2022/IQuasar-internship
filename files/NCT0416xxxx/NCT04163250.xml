  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Radiological examinations that require the administration of iodinated contrasts (IC) for&#xD;
      diagnostic and therapeutic purposes are essential in current clinical practice, and their use&#xD;
      in interventional procedures has been progressively increasing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IC can cause kidney damage, so there is caution in their use in at-risk populations. This&#xD;
      fact may limit its diagnostic use, with data on underutilization of interventional techniques&#xD;
      in patients with renal insufficiency, which worsen their prognosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, once the use of IC contrasts is decided, preventive measures, such as&#xD;
      hyperhydration,are used and can have potential side effects, especially in patients at risk&#xD;
      of heart failure (acute coronary syndrome, low left ventricular ejection fraction).&#xD;
&#xD;
      New biomarkers of kidney damage have recently been developed, based on the detection of&#xD;
      molecules expressed by the kidney in situations of early damage. The quantitative&#xD;
      determination of cell cycle arrest proteins (Tissue Inhibitor of metalloproteinase 2 (TIMP2)&#xD;
      and Insulin-Like Growth Factor Binding Protein -7 (IGFBP7)) can be predictive of the&#xD;
      development of moderate to severe contrast-associated acute kidney injury.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Urinary determination of [TIMP-2] x [IGFBP7] in patients with ACS (acute coronary syndromes)&#xD;
      before cardiac catheterization would allow early identification of those patients vulnerable&#xD;
      to IC-induced toxicity and adjustment of preventive measures.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Urinary determination of [TIMP-2] x [IGFBP7] in patients with ACS undergoing cardiac&#xD;
      catheterization would allow early identification of those patients vulnerable to IC-induced&#xD;
      toxicity and adjustment of both appropriate preventive measures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A prospective, descriptive observational study will be carried out to determine sensitivity&#xD;
      and specificity of the urinary determination of TIMP2-IGFBP7 and predictive values in the&#xD;
      early diagnosis of contrast-associated acute kidney injury (AKI) in patients admitted to the&#xD;
      Coronary Care Unit (CCU) in a spanish hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OBJECTIVES&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  PRIMARY OBJECTIVE: To determine the operational characteristics (sensitivity,&#xD;
           specificity) of the TIMP2-IGFBP7 biomarker in routine clinical practice, in the early&#xD;
           diagnosis of contrast-induced AKI (acute renal injury) in patients admitted to the CCU,&#xD;
           exposed to iodinated contrasts. The established renal failure is defined as KDIGO&#xD;
           (Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes) stage ≥ 2 in the 24 to 72 hours after the&#xD;
           administration of contrasts.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  SECONDARY OBJECTIVES&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evaluate these parameters according to the patient's initial risk level:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Estimated renal function upon admission&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Initial severity estimated by GRACE score&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Sex&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Age&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Contrast media type and volume&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patient weight&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Dose of contrast&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Diabetes&#xD;
&#xD;
      A single determination (10 ml of fresh urine) should be collected in a sterile container and&#xD;
      the laboratory should centrifuge them within the time of collection. Neither the attending&#xD;
      physicians nor the investigators will know the results, and the treatment will not be&#xD;
      influenced.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The result is reported as a single value which is the concentration of TIMP-2 (ng / mL)&#xD;
      multiplied by the concentration of IGFBP7 (ng / mL) divided by 1000. The result is reported&#xD;
      without any unit or concentrations of individual biomarkers. As previously reported, a value&#xD;
      of&gt; 0.3 identifies patients with a high probability of presenting a moderate to severe AKI&#xD;
      (acute kidney injury) in 12 hours, while a value of ≤ 0.3 identifies patients with a low risk&#xD;
      of developing a moderate to serious AKI&#xD;
&#xD;
      An aliquot of urine will be stored at -80 ° C in the Clinical Analysis Department&#xD;

According to the manufacturer, 10 ml of fresh urine should be collected in a sterile container and the laboratory should centrifuge them within the time of collection.&#xD;
The result is reported as a single value calculated as the concentration of TIMP-2 (ng / mL) multiplied by the concentration of IGFBP7 (ng / mL) divided by 1000. The result is reported without units.</description>
