    <measure>Log Geometric Mean Area Under the Concentration Versus Time Curve (AUC) From Time 0 to 48 Hours After Dosing (AUC[0-48]) of Oral Omadacycline on Day 2</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1: pre-dose; 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 13, 13.5, 14, 14.5, 15, 16, and 24 hours post dose. Day 2: pre-dose; 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 4, and 6 hours post dose</time_frame>
    <description>AUC(0-48) was calculated using the linear trapezoidal linear interpolation method using WinNonlin validated statistical analysis software (SAS) program. Participants with plasma concentration data above the limit of quantification were included in the analysis for this pharmacokinetic (PK) endpoint. If any participant had an emesis within 4 hours after dosing on Study Days 1 and 2, the participant was excluded from PK Analysis. Data for 100 mg intravenous (IV) omadacycline treatment group which was used for comparison in the statistical analysis were obtained from 6 completed studies: PTK 0796-SDES-0501, PTK 0796-BEQU-0801, PTK 0796 WOIV-0703, CPTK796-A2104, CPTK796-A2201, and PTK 0796-RENL-15102.

    <description>T1/2 was calculated using the linear regression of the terminal portion of the natural log-plasma concentration versus time curve.

    <measure>Number of Participants With Any Treatment-emergent Adverse Event (TEAE), Treatment-related TEAE, and Serious Adverse Event (SAE)</measure>
    <time_frame>From the first dose of study drug up to 37 days</time_frame>
    <description>AEs were defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a participant or clinical investigation participant, temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product. TEAEs were defined as AEs that began (or pre-existing AEs that worsened) on or after the first dose. SAEs were defined as any untoward medical occurrence that, at any dose resulted in: death, was life-threatening, required hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, resulted in disability/incapacity, was a congenital anomaly/birth defect, or was an important medical event that may have jeopardized the participant or may have required medical or surgical intervention.</description>

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants With Clinical Success, Clinical Failure and Indeterminate Clinical Response at the End of Treatment (EOT) as Determined by Investigator Assessment (IGA)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 37 days</time_frame>
    <description>The investigator determined whether or not the participant met the criteria of 1 of the following clinical outcomes: Clinical success, clinical failure, and indeterminate. Clinical success: Participant was alive and the infection was sufficiently resolved such that further antibacterial therapy was not needed. Clinical Failure: Participant required alternative antibacterial treatment for community-acquired bacterial pneumonia (CABP) prior to EOT related to either progression or development of new symptoms of CABP or development of infectious complications of CABP (eg, empyema, lung abscess) or participant developed an AE that required discontinuation of study therapy. Indeterminate: the clinical response to test article could not be adequately inferred.</description>

        <title>Log Geometric Mean Area Under the Concentration Versus Time Curve (AUC) From Time 0 to 48 Hours After Dosing (AUC[0-48]) of Oral Omadacycline on Day 2</title>
        <description>AUC(0-48) was calculated using the linear trapezoidal linear interpolation method using WinNonlin validated statistical analysis software (SAS) program. Participants with plasma concentration data above the limit of quantification were included in the analysis for this pharmacokinetic (PK) endpoint. If any participant had an emesis within 4 hours after dosing on Study Days 1 and 2, the participant was excluded from PK Analysis. Data for 100 mg intravenous (IV) omadacycline treatment group which was used for comparison in the statistical analysis were obtained from 6 completed studies: PTK 0796-SDES-0501, PTK 0796-BEQU-0801, PTK 0796 WOIV-0703, CPTK796-A2104, CPTK796-A2201, and PTK 0796-RENL-15102.
