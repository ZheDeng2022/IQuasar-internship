  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this clinical phase I, non-randomized, open-label, uncontrolled, interventional,&#xD;
      multi-center trial, 20 adult subjects (≥ 18 years of age) with advanced non-melanoma skin&#xD;
      cancers will receive a fixed dose of 0.1 mg of IFx-Hu2.0 intralesionally as monotherapy in up&#xD;
      to three lesions at up to three time points. Subjects will be observed for any acute adverse&#xD;
      events (AEs) post injection and for any delayed AEs at Day 28, 35 and/or 42 ± 7 days,&#xD;
      depending on the cohort (exposure escalation and expansion design).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Approximately twenty adult patients (≥ 18 years of age), of any sex, ethnicity, and race with&#xD;
      histologically confirmed advanced non-melanoma skin cancers with accessible lesions, will be&#xD;
      eligible for study enrollment and treatment with IFx-Hu2.0 (i.e. 20 total patients across&#xD;
      both indications). These types of advanced non-melanoma skin cancers are very rare in the&#xD;
      pediatric population (&lt; 18 years of age) with only scattered case reports. The potential for&#xD;
      development of this product for pediatric subjects with non-melanoma skin cancers will be&#xD;
      evaluated after the results of this study are available.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients must have at least one injectable lesion, defined as an easily palpable superficial&#xD;
      lesion (cutaneous, subcutaneous or lymph nodal metastasis) that can be accurately localized,&#xD;
      stabilized by palpation, and is superficial enough to enable intralesional injection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To be eligible for this study, patients must have progressed despite standard therapy(ies),&#xD;
      or are intolerant to or refused standard therapy(ies).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Enrollees will receive IFx-Hu2.0 as a monotherapy at up to three-time points. Depending on&#xD;
      the number of accessible lesions, a patient could receive up to three doses across three&#xD;
      lesions (one dose per lesion). The maximum number of lesions to be injected at any time point&#xD;
      under this protocol is three lesions. Blood will be collected from these patients prior to&#xD;
      treatment administration at every drug administration visit. These samples will be used to&#xD;
      perform CBC and clinical chemistry tests. A urine sample will be obtained for urinalysis for&#xD;
      protein and blood at the same frequency. Blood samples will also be drawn at the same&#xD;
      intervals for immune response evaluation as well.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is primarily a safety study that is designed to evaluate IFx-Hu2.0 monotherapy and&#xD;
      provide foundational evidence to potentially support further studies investigating IFx-Hu2.0&#xD;
      + anti-PD-1 combination therapy for patients with non-melanoma skin cancers.&#xD;

    <description>The investigational drug product IFx-Hu2.0 is composed of the drug substance pAc/emm55 (pDNA) complexed with the two excipients in vivo-jetPEI® (linear polyethylenimine), a transfection reagent, and dextrose, a pDNA/polyethylenimine complex stabilizer.&#xD;
Therapeutic Classification:&#xD;
Immunomodulatory Agent&#xD;
Route of Administration:&#xD;
Intralesional (i.e. injection of cutaneous, subcutaneous or nodal lesions)&#xD;
Mechanism of Action:&#xD;
Injection of IFx-Hu2.0 into the lesion facilitates the expression of the immunogenic Emm55 protein by the tumor cells.&#xD;
Physiological Effect:&#xD;
Expression of the emm55 gene by the tumor cells triggers immune recognition of tumor-specific and -associated antigens which leads to innate and adaptive immune responses.</description>
