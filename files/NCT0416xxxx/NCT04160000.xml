  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Heart failure (HF) with preserved left ventricular function (pEF) is difficult clinical&#xD;
      syndrome to treat effectively with few evidence based therapies. Atrial fibrillation (AF) is&#xD;
      now an important co-morbidity being observed in 43% of patients with HFpEF. Rhythm control&#xD;
      has not been studied in this population. Catheter ablation and antiarrhythmic drugs are&#xD;
      rhythm control therapies that have been used for treatment of AF without HF or HF with&#xD;
      reduced systolic function but have not been widely applied in HFpEF. No controlled&#xD;
      comparative evaluation has been performed in HFpEF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The introduction of wireless pulmonary artery hemodynamic monitoring has permitted&#xD;
      optimization of HF therapy in patients with chronic HF with reduced and preserved EF.&#xD;
      Reduction in HF hospitalizations has been observed in post hoc analyses of HFpEF patients but&#xD;
      has not been systematically applied in AF patients with HFpEF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, we propose to study both rhythm control and optimized HF therapeutic&#xD;
      approaches in an AF with HFpEF study population in a pilot study using a sequential two phase&#xD;
      randomized controlled clinical trial design.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective pilot study utilizing a randomized comparative sequential evaluation of&#xD;
      these two therapeutic approaches in two consecutive phases:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 1 will examine an initial catheter ablation strategy versus an initial antiarrhythmic&#xD;
      drug (AAD) therapy strategy for safety and efficacy in patients with atrial fibrillation with&#xD;
      preserved systolic cardiac function, heart failure hospitalization in the past year or one or&#xD;
      more documented HF events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 2 will examine optimized rhythm control therapy with and without wireless pulmonary&#xD;
      artery pressure hemodynamic monitoring for HF therapy optimization in the same patients as in&#xD;
      Phase 1 with documented atrial fibrillation with preserved systolic cardiac function, prior&#xD;
      HF hospitalization and class III heart failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an open label two phase study in which patients will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to&#xD;
      either ablation or AAD with a pilot phase 1 that will consist to 100 patients enrolled at 10&#xD;
      centers. They will be followed for a minimum of 6 months, after a three month blanking&#xD;
      period, for event rates of the primary endpoint as well as safety and efficacy. Phase 2 will&#xD;
      randomize patients completing Phase 1 to hemodynamic monitoring with a wireless pulmonary&#xD;
      artery sensor insertion and guided HF therapy or empiric standard of care HF therapy. They&#xD;
      will be followed for a minimum of 6 months, after a three month blanking period for&#xD;
      optimization of rhythm and HF therapies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is a sequential randomized, open label, active-controlled trial, designed to&#xD;
      compare a composite clinical outcomes endpoint of heart failure hospitalization and/or&#xD;
      cardiovascular mortality among these patients randomized to each of these treatment&#xD;
      strategies. This endpoint will be employed in both pilot trial phases to assess event rates,&#xD;
      as well as safety endpoints. This data will form the basis of a larger pivotal trial&#xD;
