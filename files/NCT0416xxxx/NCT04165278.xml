  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to further evaluate the effects of seasonal variation and the&#xD;
      aquatic thermal environment of hyperthermic baths (HTB) on the Motor Symptoms (MS) of&#xD;
      Parkinson's Disease (PD), and whether the environmental temperature is associated with these&#xD;
      effects.&#xD;

      After being informed about the study and potential risks, all participants will give written&#xD;
      informed consent. All participants who meet the inclusion criteria will undergo a complete&#xD;
      history and physical examination, including an assessment using the Movement Disorder&#xD;
      Society-United Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS), H&amp;Y stage, MMSE and MOCA. Each&#xD;
      participant will receive two subjective measures (the Movement Disorder Society-United&#xD;
      Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale part III motor examination total scores and the modified&#xD;
      Webster Symptoms Score) nine times in an open medication state (open state). Each participant&#xD;
      will take hyperthermic baths (HTB) at the same time on the first, third and fifth days. The&#xD;
      participants will receive subjective measures before and after the HTB. The time at which the&#xD;
      subjective measures begin after the HTB will be recorded. In the second week, no participants&#xD;
      accept any intervention. To avoid the effects of fluctuations in dopaminergic drugs&#xD;
      concentrations, subjective measures will be given without HTB at the recorded times on the&#xD;
      fifteenth, seventeenth and nineteenth days.&#xD;
