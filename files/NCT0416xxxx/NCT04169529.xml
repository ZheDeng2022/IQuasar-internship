  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the LINQ™ for COPD study is to characterize Reveal LINQ™ derived data from&#xD;
      patients with COPD by assessing the relationship between changes in LINQ™ derived data with&#xD;
      COPD exacerbation events.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is progressive and currently incurable and&#xD;
      refers to a collection of diseases that lead to the key feature of irreversible airflow&#xD;
      limitation and breathing related problems. Of those with COPD, 46% experienced at least one&#xD;
      exacerbation within the previous year and 19% needed hospitalization. The financial burden of&#xD;
      COPD is also evident, in that over $32 billion was spent for COPD care in the United States&#xD;
      in 2010 and it is expected to be close to $50 billion in 2020.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Reducing healthcare utilization associated with COPD patient management (i.e. short-term&#xD;
      readmission and chronic disease management) is a critically important unmet need for&#xD;
      patients, caregivers, and hospitals. Early detection, prevention, and treatment of COPD&#xD;
      exacerbation would aim to reduce this high morbidity and cost. To help reduce these&#xD;
      exacerbations and improve disease management, sensors in a minimally invasive device can be&#xD;
      used to identify factors that are associated with exacerbations.&#xD;

        The subject population for the LINQ for COPD study is COPD patients who are known to have&#xD;
        frequent exacerbations (one requiring hospitalization, ED visit, or urgent care visit, or&#xD;
        at least two others in the past year).&#xD;
