  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase II, open label, randomized study of durvalumab in combination with pemetrexed&#xD;
      and carboplatin in eligible adult patients with locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell&#xD;
      lung cancer. The study will focus on the efficacy of two alternative staggered dosing&#xD;
      regimens.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This trial will evaluated two different schedules of concurrent chemoimmunotherapy while&#xD;
      simultaneously measuring immune activation, immune resistance and host factors. Both arms&#xD;
      will consist of concurrent chemoimmunotherapy with durvalumab, pemetrexed and carboplatin,&#xD;
      but in arm 1 the chemotherapy will precede the immunotherapy by a week and in arm 2 the&#xD;
      immunotherapy will precede the chemotherapy by a week. Staggering these therapies still&#xD;
      allows concurrent administration while allowing some degree of temporal isolation to better&#xD;
      understand the contributions by chemotherapy and immunotherapy in this setting. Host and&#xD;
      laboratory factors will be measured during treatment. We hypothesize that staggered dosing of&#xD;
      immunotherapy in combination with chemotherapy can improve clinical benefit.&#xD;
