      To evaluate the efficacy and safety of ESWT for the treatment of patients with DU/UAB&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The prevalence of detrusor underactivity/ underactive bladder (DU/UAB) increased with age,&#xD;
      which is 9-28% in young men (&lt;50 years), and is up to 48% in the elderly men (&gt;70 years) with&#xD;
      non-neurogenic lower urinary tract symptoms. In women aged &gt;70 years, the prevalence of DU&#xD;
      ranged from 12% to 45%. Currently, there is a lack of effective pharmacological or surgical&#xD;
      treatment of DU/UAB. Previously we demonstrated that extracoporeal shock wave therapy (ESWT)&#xD;
      was able to mediate a partial recovery in the contractility of cryoinjury induced DU/UAB&#xD;
      model in rats. Wang et al. reported the therapeutic effect of ESWT in the streptozotocin&#xD;
      induced diabetic underactive bladder rat model with significantly improved voiding function,&#xD;
      enhanced detrusor contractility, increased muscle actin expression and muscle proportion of&#xD;
      the bladder wall, and recovery of neuronal integrity and innervations. Taken together, these&#xD;
      findings suggest that a potential clinical benefit of ESWT treatment for patients with&#xD;
      DU/UAB.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 60 patients with DU/UAB will be enrolled to receive ESWT once a week for 6 weeks&#xD;
      or placebo treatment. Patients with DU/UAB symptoms with post void residual (PVR) ≥ 100 mL&#xD;
      and proven of DU/UAB without bladder outlet obstruction (BOO) by urodynamic study. Patients&#xD;
      should not have uncontrolled acute urinary tract infection, and should not have treated with&#xD;
      an investigational device, drug, or procedure for UAB within the last 3 months. Retreatment&#xD;
      with ESWT at 3 months if patient reports ineffective will be allowed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary end-point is the change of PVR volume (mL) from baseline to 1 month after treatment.&#xD;
      Secondary endpoints include daily frequency, nocturia and FBC as record in 3-day voiding&#xD;
      diary, Qmax, Pdet@Qmax, voided volume, PVR and global response assessment (GRA). One visit is&#xD;
      required at baseline screening (before first treatment), treatment 1 (V1), treatment 2 (V2),&#xD;
      treatment 3 (V3), treatment 4 (V4), treatment 5 (V5), treatment 6 (V6) and 1 month post V6&#xD;
      treatment (V7, primary end-point), and 3 months post V6 treatment (V8). Urine samples will be&#xD;
      collected at each time-point for NGF and cytokines tests. Cystoscopy bladder biopsy will be&#xD;
      performed at baseline and at 3 months post treatment, optional.&#xD;
