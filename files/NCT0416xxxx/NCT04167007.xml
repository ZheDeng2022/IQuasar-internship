  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PAC) incidence increases regularly in Western countries and it is&#xD;
      expected to become the second leading cause of cancer-related mortality in 2020. The&#xD;
      prognosis of this disease remains very poor with an overall 5-year survival rate less than&#xD;
      5%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The FOLFIRINOX regimen (5-fluorouracil [5-FU], folinic acid, irinotecan, and oxaliplatin) and&#xD;
      the combination of nab-paclitaxel with gemcitabine demonstrated to be more effective than&#xD;
      gemcitabine alone, and are both validated as standard first-line treatment options for&#xD;
      metastatic PAC. However, the use of FOLFIRINOX is limited to patients with ECOG performance&#xD;
      status (PS) 0-1 and aged less than 75 years. Nab-paclitaxel is currently not reimbursed in&#xD;
      France.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This trial is an open label, multicenter, randomized phase III trial comparing gemcitabine vs&#xD;
      FOLFOX in patients with metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma and non-fit for FOLFIRINOX.&#xD;
      Adults fulfilling inclusion criteria and non-inclusion criteria will be randomized between a&#xD;
      FOLFOX arm and a gemcitabine arm. The primary endpoint is the overall survival (OS) at 24&#xD;
      months. The secondary objectives are : objective response rate and disease control rate&#xD;
      (RECIST v1.1, in case of evaluable lesion), duration of response, duration of disease&#xD;
      control, progression free survival (PFS), the evolution of biomarkers Ca 19-9 and CEA under&#xD;
      treatment, the toxicities according to International Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse&#xD;
      Events (CTCAE) version 4.0, the safety of both arms, the quality of life, the dose intensity&#xD;
      (DI) of each protocol, the Quality-Adjusted Survival, and the rate and type of second-line /&#xD;
      third-line regimens chemotherapy. With an expected median survival time in the control group&#xD;
      of 5 months, an accrual period of 3 years and a minimum follow-up period of 2 years, a total&#xD;
      of 199 patients per group are required to detect a hazard ratio of 0.75 based on a 5%&#xD;
      two-sided type I error rate and a power of 80%, leading to a total number of 400 patients to&#xD;
      include.&#xD;

The primary Q-TWiST analysis will be performed using the Intention-to-treat analysis(ITT) population, and will be supplemented with analyses in the per-protocol population (i.e., patients who received ≥80% of the protocol-defined treatment during the first 6 weeks of treatment) and analysed in pre-specified subgroups: age (&lt;75 years, ≥75 years), baseline PS (0-1, 2), liver metastases (Yes, No), and tumour location (head, other).</description>
