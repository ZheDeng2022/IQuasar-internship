    <textblock>
      A descripative cohort study which included 60 pregnant women recuirted from Obstetrics and&#xD;
      Gynecology Department, Menoufia University Hospital and diagnosed as placenta previa accreta.&#xD;
&#xD;
      • Ethical considerations: Ethics: The study was approved by Ethical Committee of Menoufia&#xD;
      Faculty of Medicine.&#xD;
&#xD;

      was obtained from all cases included in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size: (No= 60) Based on previous studies regarding MAP, The incidence of placenta&#xD;
      accreta = 1/2500 , so the calculated sample size for this study was 59 which to be around 60&#xD;
      with confidence level 95% margin of error 5% (Pliskow S et al., 2009).&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
                  1. The presence of irregular shaped placental lacunae within the placenta.&#xD;
&#xD;
                  2. Thinning of myometrium overlying the placenta.&#xD;

&#xD;
                  6. Turbulent blood flow through the lacunae on Doppler ultrasonography.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  All patients were subjected to the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Detailed history taking:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Personal history: name ,age, address, occupation, marietal status, number of children&#xD;
           ,age of the youngest child, the gender of the children and special habbits of medical&#xD;
           importance like smoking.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Past history: past medical history (e.g. diabetes mellitus, hypertension, renal disease,&#xD;

           delivery, any operative complications, number of children and their gender , any&#xD;
           neonatal complications, number of abortions, gestational age of them, if abortion&#xD;
           followed by surgery like evacuation and curettage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Clinical examination:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. General examination:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  General condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Vital signs including blood pressure, pulse, temperature.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Height, weight and body mass index (BMI).&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Neck : thyroid gland, neck veins and pulsations.&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
             2. Palpation:&#xD;
&#xD;
                To detect tenderness, rigidity and fundal level.&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Auscultation:&#xD;
&#xD;
                Fetal heart sounds.&#xD;
&#xD;
                III. Investigations :&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  Preoperative labaratory investigations like complete blood count (CBC),&#xD;
                     prothrombin time (PT), liver function, kidney function, virology and ECG.&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  Obstetric ultrasound:&#xD;
&#xD;
                Fetal observation : transabdominal pelvic ultrasound was performed to detect fetal&#xD;
                presentation, lie, viability ( by observation of fetal heart movement), gestational&#xD;
                age by measuring biparital diameter, femur length and abdominal circumference) and&#xD;
                fetal weight.&#xD;
&#xD;
                Placenta observation : site (anterior or posterior), position in realtion to&#xD;
                internal os to determine type of placenta previa and colour Doppler to determine&#xD;
                grade of accretion ( accrete, increta, percreta and focal aacretion) and criteria&#xD;
                of accretion.&#xD;
&#xD;
                Surgical Procedure:&#xD;
&#xD;
                Uterine conservation required multidisciplinary team including the obstetrician,&#xD;
                anasethetist and urologist in certain cases.&#xD;
&#xD;
                  1. Preoperative prophylactic antibiotic was given to study cases prior to skin&#xD;
                     incision tio avoid postoperative endometritis in the form of 2gm ampicillin.&#xD;
                     (ACOG, 2011)&#xD;
&#xD;
                  2. Preoperative blood cross matching as availability of adequate blood was&#xD;
                     mandatory.&#xD;
&#xD;
                  3. Operative Steps:&#xD;
&#xD;
                       -  Elective CS at 36 weeks to 37 weeks was done.&#xD;
&#xD;
                       -  Prior to delivery, two large bore venous lines were placed.&#xD;
&#xD;
                       -  General anasethia was recommended.&#xD;
&#xD;
                       -  Foley catheter was inserted.&#xD;
&#xD;
                       -  Sterilization by povidone- iodine scrub and toweling.&#xD;
&#xD;
                       -  Midline incision was done as it made field obvious.&#xD;
&#xD;
                       -  Incision of subcutaneous tissue and rectus sheath.&#xD;
&#xD;
                       -  Separation of two recti.&#xD;
&#xD;
                       -  Classical CS (vertical incision in the upper uterine segment) or high&#xD;
                          transverse uterine incision was done to decrease haemorrhage through&#xD;
                          placental bed and to avoid urinary bladder injury as it may be adherent&#xD;
                          to lower uterine segment in some cases.&#xD;
&#xD;
                       -  Delievery of the fetus by gental fundal pressure.&#xD;
&#xD;
                       -  At the delivery of the fetus 10 UI of oxytocin IV was injected to help&#xD;
                          uterus to contract and avoid postpartum atony and to decrease blood loss&#xD;
                          during delivery.&#xD;
&#xD;
                       -  No attempt to the deliver the placenta&#xD;
&#xD;
                       -  Exteriorization of uterus including placenta clamped.&#xD;
&#xD;
                       -  Two corners of the uterine incision, and the superior and inferior lips,&#xD;
                          were clamped immediately by four clamps.&#xD;
&#xD;
                       -  Opening of the broad ligament via round ligament division and ligation.&#xD;
&#xD;
                       -  Gentle dissection of the bladder from the uterus was performed from&#xD;
                          lateral aspect to medially.&#xD;
&#xD;
                       -  Bilateral uterine artery clamping at below the placental bed&#xD;
&#xD;
                       -  Continue gentle dissection the remaining adherent part of the urinary&#xD;
                          bladder&#xD;
&#xD;
                       -  Gentle attempt to delierve the placenta by gentle traction on clamp.&#xD;
&#xD;
                       -  If the placenta was delievered, bilateral uterine artery ligation at&#xD;
                          multiple levels and multiple square compression sutures (if needed) to&#xD;
                          control pacental bleeding bed .&#xD;
&#xD;
                       -  If the placenta was not delievered we did segmental ressection of lower&#xD;
                          uterine segment including the placenta. The affected area, once excised&#xD;
                          can be repaired and the patient was treated as though she had a classical&#xD;
                          cesarean delivery.&#xD;
&#xD;
                       -  Intraperitoneal drain was inserted for early detection of intraperitoneal&#xD;
                          hemorrhage or urine leak in case of cystotomy repair or possible ureteric&#xD;
                          injury.&#xD;
&#xD;
                       -  The amount of blood loss within 24 h after surgery was measured by the&#xD;
                          weight of blood-soaked disposable hip pads minus its own weight.&#xD;
&#xD;
                       -  Transfusion must include not only packed red blood cells (PRBC), but also&#xD;
                          fresh frozen plasma and/or cryoprecipitate to maintain in a 2:1 ratio to&#xD;
                          prevent dillutional coagulopathy&#xD;
&#xD;
                Outcome variables:&#xD;
&#xD;
                  1. Demographic data e.g age, parity, body mass index (BMI).&#xD;
&#xD;
                  2. Amount of blood loss by measuring Hb preoperatively and after blood&#xD;
                     transfusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
                  3. Amount of blood loss intraoperative via amount and number of tampons used.&#xD;
&#xD;
                  4. Amount of blood and blood products transfusion.&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
                  6. Duration of ambulation and audible intestinal sounds.&#xD;
&#xD;
                  7. Follow up of nishe at placental bed after 6 weeks via color Doppler&#xD;
                     Ultrasoumd.&#xD;
&#xD;
                  8. Intraoperative complications e.g urinary bladder injury, ureteric injury.&#xD;
&#xD;
                  9. Postoperative complications e.g ileus, sepsis.&#xD;
