      A comparison of laser (REPaiR) compared with minimally invasive surgical therapy for moderate&#xD;
      to severe periodontal disease.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>

      The Trial is a multi-center, randomized, blinded, parallel arm trial of REPaiR therapy&#xD;
      (experimental treatment) versus MIST (control therapy) in a maximum of 2 qualifying&#xD;
      periodontal study teeth will be treated in each subject. Qualifying teeth will have PPD ≥ 6mm&#xD;
      and intrabony vertical ≥ 3 mm, with base of defect ≥ 3 mm coronal to the tooth apex, and&#xD;
      defect angle ≥ 25°.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For Subjects already in maintenance therapy and having completed scaling and root planing&#xD;
      within the previous 6-months, up to 3 Study Teeth will be selected and SRP conducted on just&#xD;
      these teeth, and subjects will be randomized to either Test or Control Therapies (Visit 3).&#xD;
      For patients already in maintenance therapy and NOT having completed SRP within the previous&#xD;
      6-months, up to 3 qualifying teeth may be selected, and localized SRP in the study teeth&#xD;
      quadrants (Visit 2) can be followed after 4-6 weeks by Visit 3 Therapy on up to 2 Study&#xD;
      Teeth. Other subjects not in maintenance therapy and with up to 3 qualifying teeth will be&#xD;
      selected at the Screening Visit; then 4-6 weeks following SRP, up to 2 Study Teeth will be&#xD;
      selected, and subjects will be randomized to either Test or Control Therapies. Follow-up&#xD;
      assessments will be conducted on all subjects by a blinded examiner over a 12-month period.&#xD;

    <description>Beginning with the &quot;papilla preservation technique&quot; (Takei et al), further improved by Cortellini et al (1995) and combined with minimally invasive approaches (Harrel et al 1995), MIST, using &quot;minimally invasive surgical approaches and micro-surgery instruments,&quot; has evolved into a decision tree guideline for treating periodontitis based on periodontal pocket morphology and papilla width/ interdental space (Cortellini P, Tonetti MS (2007) J Clin Periodontol;34(1):87-93).</description>

    <description>The REPaiR regimen is a step-by-step protocol for using the Waterlase Express Er,Cr:YSGG laser for periodontitis. The protocol steps and associated laser delivery is controlled by a computer interface that dictates laser tip, energy and associated air and water mixes. Like MIST, REPaiR uses a set, decision tree approach for periodontal therapy, with prescribed steps and laser settings to quantify and standardize treatment. Potential clinical benefit, as with MIST, are not only effective periodontal therapy with reduced recession compared with traditional surgical approaches, but also reduced patient morbidity (Arnabat-Domínguez et al (2010). Lasers Med Sci;25(3):459-64).</description>
