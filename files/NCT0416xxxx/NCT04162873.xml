  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well celecoxib works through surgery and radiation therapy in&#xD;
      treating patients with head and neck cancer that has spread to other places in the body&#xD;
      (advanced). Celecoxib is Food and Drug Administration approved to treat arthritis, acute&#xD;
      pain, and painful menstrual periods. Adding celecoxib to standard of care treatment may help&#xD;
      to decrease the amount of time between surgery and radiation therapy.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To assess the number of days from surgery to initiation of radiation and adjuvant therapy&#xD;
      with the addition of celecoxib compared to placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To assess overall pain control and management for patients on celecoxib compared to&#xD;
      placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To assess functional outcomes for patients on celecoxib compared to placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To assess the effect of celecoxib therapy on Quality of Life (QoL) compared to placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To assess the average number of treatment days missed during adjuvant therapy for&#xD;
      patients on celecoxib compared to placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM I: Patients receive celecoxib orally (PO) or via feeding tube twice daily (BID) starting&#xD;
      5 days prior to surgery and continues until the completion of radiation therapy (up to 6&#xD;
      months in total) in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM II: Patients receive placebo PO or via feeding tube BID starting 5 days prior to surgery&#xD;
      and continues until the completion of radiation therapy (up to 6 months in total) in the&#xD;
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;

    <time_frame>up to 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The day of surgery will be considered day 0 and the number of days will be counted until the first dose of adjuvant therapy. A Gaussian mixed effects regression model will be used to compare the average number of days from surgery to the initiation of radiation and adjuvant therapy between treatment and control groups. The model will contain fixed effects for treatment arm and provider and a nested random effect for patient within provider. The mean difference between treatment groups, two-sided p-value and 95% confidence interval will be calculated from the model.</description>
