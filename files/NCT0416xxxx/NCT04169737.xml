    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well acalabrutinib and venetoclax with or without early&#xD;
      obinutuzumab work for the treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia or small lymphocytic&#xD;
      lymphoma that is high risk, has come back (recurrent), or does not respond to treatment&#xD;
      (refractory). Acalabrutinib may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking some of the&#xD;
      enzymes needed for cell growth. Venetoclax may stop the growth cancer cells by blocking BCL-2&#xD;
      protein needed for cell growth. Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as&#xD;
      obinutuzumab, may help the body's immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere with the&#xD;
      ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Giving acalabrutinib and venetoclax together with&#xD;
      early obinutuzumab may improve clinical outcomes and control the disease.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Demonstrate improvement in bone marrow (BM) undetectable-minimal residual disease,10-4&#xD;
      sensitivity (MRD4) from 40% to 70% after 7 courses of combined acalabrutinib (ACA) and&#xD;
      venetoclax (VEN) (end of C9 overall) with addition of early obinutuzumab (OBIN).&#xD;
      (Treatment-naive [TN] cohort) II. Demonstrate improvement in BM undetectable-MRD4 from 40% to&#xD;
      70% after 12 courses of combined acalabrutinib (ACA) and venetoclax (VEN) (end of cycle [C]14&#xD;
      overall) with addition of early obinutuzumab (OBIN). (Relapsed/refractory [R/R] cohort)&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY AND EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Determine the safety of combined acalabrutinib, venetoclax obinutuzumab. II. Determine the&#xD;
      overall best response rates (complete response [CR], partial response [PR], overall response&#xD;
      [OR]) for each cohort and each treatment arm by International Workshop on Chronic Lymphocytic&#xD;
      Leukemia (iwCLL) 2018 criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. Estimate the time to best response for each cohort and each treatment arm with this&#xD;
      combination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. Estimate the progression-free (PFS) for each cohort and each treatment arm. V. Estimate&#xD;
      proportion of patients with blood/BM undetectable-MRD4, blood/BM undetectable-MRD6 (10-6&#xD;
      sensitivity), CR after 12 and 24 courses combination with VEN (end of C14 and C26 overall)&#xD;
      (by cohort and OBIN status).&#xD;
&#xD;
      VI. Determine the proportion of patients who receive late OBIN (C15-C20 overall) and&#xD;
      conversion rate for blood/BM undetectable-MRD4 and blood/BM undetectable-MRD6 and CR in those&#xD;
      who receive late OBIN.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VII. Correlate plasma cell-free deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) (cfDNA) with cell-based blood/BM&#xD;
      undetectable-MRD4, blood/BM undetectable-MRD6 status at all response assessment time points.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VIII. Determine proportion of patients who discontinue treatment early based on&#xD;
      undetectable-MRD results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IX. Determine time-to-blood MRD6 relapse for those who achieve undetectable-MRD6.&#xD;
&#xD;
      X. Determine response to re-treatment upon relapse. XI. Assess clonal evolution at relapse&#xD;
      and correlate with plasma cell-free DNA (cfDNA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      XII. Determine OBIN pharmacokinetics - free drug level assessments to optimize dosing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      XIII. Determine VEN pharmacokinetics - free drug levels to assess changes in exposure with&#xD;
      combination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      XIV. Determine ACA pharmacokinetics - free drug levels to assess changes in exposure with&#xD;
      combination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      XV. Identify predictive markers for response and outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM I: Patients receive acalabrutinib orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 1-28. Beginning&#xD;
      cycle 3, patients receive venetoclax PO BID on days 1-28. Patients who are BM MRD4-positive&#xD;
      or in PR also receive obinutuzumab intravenously (IV) over 4-6 hours on days 1, 2, 8, and 15&#xD;
      of cycle 15 and day 1 of cycles 16-20. Treatment repeats every 28 days (or 42 days for cycle&#xD;
      14) for up to 26 cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM II: Patients receive acalabrutinib PO BID on days 1-28 beginning cycle 2 and venetoclax&#xD;
      PO BID on days 1-28 beginning cycle 3. Patients also receive obinutuzumab IV over 4-6 hours&#xD;
      on days 1, 2, 8, and 15 of cycle 1 and day 1 of cycles 2-6. Patients who are BM MRD4-positive&#xD;
      or in PR receive obinutuzumab IV over 4-6 hours on day 1 cycles 15-20. Treatment repeats&#xD;
      every 28 days (or 42 days for cycle 14) for up to 26 cycles in the absence of disease&#xD;
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up periodically.&#xD;
