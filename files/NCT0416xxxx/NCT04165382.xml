  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Non-invasive ventilation (NIV) is increasingly used for supporting preterm infants with&#xD;
      respiratory distress in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU), and the incidence for nasal&#xD;
      injury including skin redness or breakdown associated with pressure from the nasal interfaces&#xD;
      is found in infants receiving this support. Risk is found higher in preterm infants than term&#xD;
      infants due to the smaller gestation age and lower birth weight. Thus, the study aims to&#xD;
      develop, implement, and evaluate an evidence-based practice guideline (the guideline) for&#xD;
      preterm infants receiving NIV in the NICU. With the implementation of this guideline, it&#xD;
      helps to promote comfort to infants receiving NIV, and at the same time to minimize&#xD;
      complications associated with NIV.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A workgroup is formed in the NICU to provide expert opinions in the process of development,&#xD;
      implementation, and evaluation of the guideline. It consists of five nurses, one&#xD;
      neonatologist and one physiotherapist. After that, 16 evidence-based articles were identified&#xD;
      in several scientific databases, and practices in the guideline are developed after reviewed&#xD;
      and appraised the articles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interventions in the guideline involve six components as&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. choice of &quot;right&quot; nasal interfaces, in which the &quot;right&quot; size of nasal interface either&#xD;
           short binasal prongs or nasal mask is chosen according to the size of the infant's nose&#xD;
           and distance between two nasal nares. In addition, the &quot;right&quot; size of bonnet using to&#xD;
           anchoring the ventilator tubing is also selected according to the size of infant's head.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. use of skin protective dressing, in which the hydrocolloid dressing is used to cover the&#xD;
           skin areas underneath the nasal interface and anchoring straps;&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. alternate the nasal interfaces from the short binasal prongs to nasal mask every 6&#xD;
           hours;&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. positioning the infants regularly for 4-6 hours, at optimal developmental body position&#xD;
           but avoid prone position, and well supporting the devices to prevent displacement and&#xD;
           traction onto the infant's skin after changed position;&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. supportive care including to wet the prongs with sterile water or saline before&#xD;
           inserting into the nasal nares, to clean the infant's faces and nasal areas daily, to&#xD;
           wipe away any water condensate over infant's nasal areas every 4-6 hours, to gently&#xD;
           massage the areas during removal of the nasal interfaces or devices for examination at&#xD;
           every routine care, to provide oral care every 3-4 hours and avoid unnecessary nasal&#xD;
           suctioning, to provide adequate humidification to the ventilation circuit, to remove&#xD;
           water condensate in the interfaces and ventilator circuit, to aspirate air from the&#xD;
           gastric tube before every tube feeding to relieve abdominal distension;&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. regular assessments on infants receiving NIV for pain level by Neonatal Pain, Agitation&#xD;
           and Sedation Scale, intact of skin integrity for the areas in contacting with the nasal&#xD;
           interfaces and devices of NIV, and to rate the severity of injury by the staging system&#xD;
           from National Pressure Ulcer Advisory Panel.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study includes two periods of &quot;pre-implementation&quot; and &quot;post-implementation&quot;. In the&#xD;
      pre-implementation period, all infants receiving NIV will be providing the usual care&#xD;
      including choice of nasal interfaces in which larger or smaller interfaces may be given to&#xD;
      the infant, use of skin protective dressing, positioning which is not restricted to the&#xD;
      frequency of turning or types of position, supportive care of providing humidification to the&#xD;
      ventilator circuit, oral care and avoiding of unnecessary nasal suctioning, removing of water&#xD;
      condensate in the ventilator circuit, aspirating of air before alternate tube feeding.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A one-month training will be given to nurses working in the NICU after completion of the&#xD;
      pre-implementation period. The training contains a dialect lecture, video demonstration of&#xD;
      care, and scenario discussion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of the one-month training, the post-implementation period will be commenced,&#xD;
      and the care in the guideline will be provided to infants receiving NIV.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection on infant participants and nurses will be conducted during the study period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data analysis will be performed to evaluate the effectiveness of the guideline as well as the&#xD;
      increase of nurses' knowledge in care of infants receiving NIV and their compliances to the&#xD;
      guideline.&#xD;

To study whether the interventions of the guideline can promote comfort for preterm infants receiving NIV, by studying indirectly on the pain level.
