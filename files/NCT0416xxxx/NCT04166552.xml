      The purpose of this trial is to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and&#xD;
      preliminary efficacy of EHP-101 in adult subjects with diffuse cutaneous Systemic Sclerosis&#xD;
      (dcSSc).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      An interventional, double-blind, randomized, intracohort placebo-controlled design will be&#xD;
      used to test safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and preliminary efficacy of EHP-101 in&#xD;
      36 patients ≥ 18 and ≤ 74 years of age with documented dcSS. There will up a screening period&#xD;
      of up to 28 days, 84 days treatment period, and 28 days follow-up.&#xD;

    <time_frame>Day 85 and Day 113</time_frame>
    <description>The ACR CRISS exponential algorithm determines the predicted probability of improvement from baseline, incorporating change in modified Rodnan Skin Score (mRSS), Forced Vital Capacity (FVC) % predicted, physician and patient global assessments, and Scleroderma Health Assessment Questionnaire Disability Index (S-HAQ-DI). The outcome is a continuous variable between 0.0 and 1.0 (0 - 100%). Subjects are not considered improved (ACR CRISS score = 0) if they develop new: 1) renal crisis; 2) decline in FVC% predicted by 15% (relative) from baseline and confirmed after 1 month; or 3) left ventricular failure (systolic ejection fraction &lt; 45%); or 4) new pulmonary artery hypertension on right heart catheterization requiring treatment.</description>

    <measure>Treatment effect of EHP-101 compared to placebo in modified Rodnan skin score</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 85 and Day 113</time_frame>
    <description>The mRSS consists of an evaluation of patient's skin thickness rated by clinical palpation using a 0-3 scale (0 = normal skin; 1 = mild thickness; 2 = moderate thickness; 3 = severe thickness with inability to pinch the skin into a fold for each of 17 surface anatomic areas of the body: face, anterior chest, abdomen, and, with right and left sides of the body separately evaluated, the fingers, forearms, upper arms, thighs, lower legs, dorsum of hands and feet. Individual values are summed and defined as the total skin score. Total score is 0 to 51.</description>

    <measure>Treatment effect of EHP-101 compared to placebo in forced vital capacity percent predicted</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 85 and Day 113</time_frame>
    <description>Forced vital capacity (FVC) is a standard pulmonary function test used to quantify respiratory muscle weakness . FVC was the volume of air that can forcibly be blown out after full inspiration in the upright position, measured in liters. Predicted forced vital capacity is based on a formula using sex, age and height of a person, and is an estimate of healthy lung capacity. Percent of predicted FVC = (observed value)/(predicted value) * 100%</description>

    <measure>Treatment effect of EHP-101 compared to placebo in physician global assessment score</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 85 and Day 113</time_frame>
    <description>The Physician Global Assessment of disease activity will be performed using a segmented numerical version of the visual analogue scale in which the physician selects a whole number (0-10 integers) that best reflects the overall disease activity. The numerical rating score is anchored by 2 verbal descriptors, one of &quot;no disease activity&quot; (score of 0) and one of &quot;worse imaginable disease activity&quot; (score of 10), with numbers 1-9 spaced equidistance in between. The physician will select an integer to describe disease activity. The recall period is one week.</description>

    <time_frame>Day 85 and Day 113</time_frame>
    <description>S-HAQ-DI includes 8 sections: dressing, arising, eating, walking, hygiene, reach, grip, and activities. There are two or three questions for each section. Scoring within each section is from 0 (without any difficulty) to 3 (unable to do). The eight scores of the eight sections are summed and divided by 8. If one section is not completed by a subject, the summed score is divided by 7. As such, maximum scores can vary with a min of 0. The result is the DI, the disability index or functional disability index. The recall period is one week.</description>

    <description>The UCLA SCTC GIT 2.0 has 7 multi-item scales: Reflux, Distension/Bloating, Diarrhea, Fecal Soilage, Constipation, Emotional Well-being, and Social Functioning and a total GIT score. All scales are scored from 0 [better health-related quality of life (HRQOL)] to 3 (worse HRQOL) except the diarrhea and constipation scales (ranges 0-2 and 0-2.5, respectively). The Total GIT Score, is developed by averaging 6 of 7 scales (excluding constipation). The recall period is one week.</description>
