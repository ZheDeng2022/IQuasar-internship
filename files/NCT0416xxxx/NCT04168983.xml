  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The bone marrow aspiration and biopsy (BMAB) is an essential and indispensable examination&#xD;
      for the diagnosis and the follow-up of the hematological diseases but which remains painful&#xD;
      and dread by the patients. Until then it was performed manually using a trocar. It is now&#xD;
      practiced most often using a tool (like a small drill), device that pierces through the&#xD;
      external iliac bone to extract a bone cylinder that will be analyzed&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the gesture is faster than with the manual method, it remains overall painful and the&#xD;
      noise generated by the drill that passes through the periosteum of the iliac bone is&#xD;
      impressive for the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prevention measures to limit pain and anxiety are put in place during the examination: local&#xD;
      anesthesia, with or without a lidocaine patch, as well as inhalation of a mixture of nitrous&#xD;
      oxide and oxygen (MEOPA®). These, recommended by the &quot;Standards, Options, Recommendation&quot;&#xD;
      (SOR) often remain insufficient and are not devoid of undesirable effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite these precautions, several studies show that the action remains painful and&#xD;
      anxiety-provoking.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An exploratory survey carried out in the hematology department of the François Baclesse&#xD;
      Center in 2013 confirms these results and specifies that the pain remains present for another&#xD;
      30 minutes after the examination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators believe that associating a psycho-corporeal technique, as is sophrology,&#xD;
      with the usual care, could contribute to the decrease of the threshold of pain and anxiety&#xD;
      during the BMAB and avoid the use of a premedication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The effectiveness of sophrology as a complementary technique in the field of pain prevention&#xD;
      in invasive procedures is recognized by observations and clinical results. This complementary&#xD;
      therapy, among others, has its place in the hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To date, to investigator's knowledge, there is no published, randomized study evaluating the&#xD;
      effectiveness of sophrology on pain in invasive procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators propose a study whose main objective is to evaluate the effectiveness of a&#xD;
      session of sophrology on the pain felt during the realization of the BMAB, in patients with&#xD;
      hematological malignancy. This session will be provided by a sophrologist nurse This study&#xD;
      should include 90 patients undergoing a BMAB over a 24-month period.&#xD;
