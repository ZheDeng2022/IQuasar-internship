  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There are two choices of restorations and implant abutments connection now: cemented and&#xD;
      screw-retained.The excess cement, which would be difficult to completely remove, might lead&#xD;
      to series of biological complications. The angulated screw channel (ASC) abutments, which&#xD;
      recently introduced by Nobel Biocare , largely address the problem with visible screw access&#xD;
      that may compromise esthetics. However, all of the present studies were clinical reports,&#xD;
      thus the clinical efficacy of ASC abutments still needs the verification of evidence-based&#xD;
      medicine with larger sample. Therefore, we designed a randomized controlled clinical trial&#xD;
      study, aiming to verify the clinical efficacy of the ASC abutments by comparing&#xD;
      screw-retained (with ASC abutments) single implant crowns with cemented ones in esthetic&#xD;
      region.&#xD;
