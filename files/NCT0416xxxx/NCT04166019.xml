    <textblock>
      This randomized controlled trial is to test the effectiveness of a peer-led self-management&#xD;
      program (PLSMI) for people with recent-onset psychosis in the community over 18-month&#xD;
      follow-up, compared with a conventional psychoeducation group and routine community mental&#xD;
      healthcare.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Objectives: to investigate the effectiveness of a peer-led self-management intervention&#xD;
      (PLSMI) for recent-onset psychosis on patient outcomes over 18-months follow-up, compared&#xD;
      with a conventional psycho-education group and routine care only group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypotheses: When compared with those in a psycho-education group and routine care, the PLSMI&#xD;
      participants will indicate significantly greater:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Improvement in patients' level of recovery at 1-2 weeks post-intervention (Primary&#xD;
           hypothesis and outcome);&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Reduction of their re-hospitalization rates and symptom severity, and/or improvement in&#xD;
           functioning, satisfaction with service, problem-solving, and insight into illness at 1-2&#xD;
           weeks post-intervention; and/or&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Improvements in the above outcomes (hypotheses 1) at 6-, 12- and/or 18-month follow-ups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary outcome is patients' level of recovery. Qualitative interviews with purposely&#xD;
      selected PLSMI participants and all peer support workers (agreed for interview) will enhance&#xD;
      understanding about their perceived benefits, service satisfaction, strengths, and&#xD;
      limitations of the intervention undertaken from peer-workers' and participants' perspectives.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design: A multi-center randomized controlled trial with repeated-measures, three-group&#xD;
      design on a community-based PLSMI will be conducted with both outcome and process evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects: 180 people with recent-onset psychosis (not more than 3 years onset) randomly&#xD;
      selected from 6 Integrated Community Centers for Mental Wellness and randomly assigned into 3&#xD;
      arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Instruments/Measures: Level of self-reported recovery (QPS, primary outcome); occurrence and&#xD;
      frequency of and time to psychiatric hospitalization over past 6 or 18 months; symptom&#xD;
      severity (PANSS); problem solving ability (C-SPSI-R:S); illness insight (ITAQ); functioning&#xD;
      (SLOF), and service satisfaction (CSQ-8).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Focus group interviews will be conducted to collect views on benefits and weaknesses of&#xD;
      PLSMI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data analyses: Comparing the mean value changes of outcomes between-groups across time on&#xD;
      intention-to-treat basis, using MANOVA/Mixed Modeling/Generalized Estimation Equations test&#xD;
      and comparing the occurrence of and time to hospitalization between groups using survival&#xD;
      analysis and Cox regression test; content analysis of qualitative data from focus-group&#xD;
      interviews and intervention sessions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expected results: The findings provide evidence of the effectiveness of peer-support&#xD;
      self-management program for early-stage psychosis in community mental health healthcare on&#xD;
      improving patients' recovery and other important patient outcomes, as well as service&#xD;
      satisfaction.&#xD;

    <description>Peer-led self-management program (PLSMI) consists of 10 weekly/biweekly, 1.5-hour sessions (4 months), based on the modified Crisis-resolution-team Optimization and Relapse Prevention (CORE) program workbook/manual and psycho-education programs developed by the research team. The program based on completion of a self-management workbook, consisting of the main components: personal recovery goals, plans to re-establish community functioning and support networks following a crisis, identifying early warning signs and creating a relapse prevention plan, and strategies and coping resources to problem-solving and maintain well-being. Participants work through the workbook at their own pace, with the support from the peer support worker, to facilitate/support their recovery. They will meet in group with a trained peer support worker on 10 sessions, usually at 7-12 days intervals over 4 months.</description>
