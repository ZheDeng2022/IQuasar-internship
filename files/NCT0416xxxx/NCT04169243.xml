      The study evaluates whether the New Nordic Diet, compared to routine care, will improve&#xD;
      glucose control, among women developing gestational diabetes mellitus during pregnancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Originally, a 10 wk intervention with qualified counseling on New Nordic Diet was planned,&#xD;
      and effects on glycosylated haemoglobin A (HbA1c) at gestational age 37 weeks was planned as&#xD;
      main outcome. Recruitment started in spring 2020 but had to be halted due to covid-19. In&#xD;
      fall 2021, we now plan to conduct a more comprehensive version of the study, with a more&#xD;
      intensive intervention consisting of distributed food bags plus dietary counselling for two&#xD;
      weeks, and with continuous glucose monitoring during these two weeks to measure main outcome.&#xD;
      This is more sensitive to small changes than is HbA1c. With this shorter and more intensive&#xD;
      intervention we believe we can address our original hypothesis yet adjust to impacts of the&#xD;
      current covid-19 situation on the population and health care system.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is associated with severe adverse outcomes for mother and&#xD;
      newborn. Recently introduced Swedish guidelines on GDM diagnosis will at least double the&#xD;
      prevalence of diagnosed women. The first line of treatment in GDM is diet and exercise&#xD;
      treatment. Even so, there is a recognized knowledge gap as to what diet treatment is optimal.&#xD;
      In routine care today, diagnosed women are provided by midwife with the same diet advice as&#xD;
      patients with diabetes type 2 and these are broad and general. Only rarely are the diet&#xD;
      advice provided by a dietician. In nutrition research, most evidence for health benefits of a&#xD;
      diet has been demonstrated for the Mediterranean diet. Further, the New Nordic Diet (NND) was&#xD;
      recently developed to mimic the Mediterranean diet yet builds on foods grown in the Nordic&#xD;
      climate, thus focusing on gastronomical potential and sustainability. Interestingly, a diet&#xD;
      intake in line with NND among Norwegian mothers was associated with lower risk for excessive&#xD;
      pregnancy weight gain. In addition, associations have been shown between NND and lower risk&#xD;
      for cardiovascular disease, obesity, inflammatory risk markers, serum lipids, colorectal&#xD;
      cancer and total mortality. Hence, it seems likely that diet treatment with NND to women with&#xD;
      GDM would be superior to routine care, but this has never been investigated. The main aim of&#xD;
      the randomized controlled trial Intervention with new Nordic DIet in women with GestatiOnal&#xD;
      diabetes mellitus (iNDIGO) is to test if the NND compared with usual care will improve&#xD;
      glucose control in women with GDM. The iNDIGO study is a randomized parallel, single-blinded,&#xD;
      controlled trial. In total, 50 women diagnosed with GDM will be recruited and randomized to&#xD;
      receive either a NND (intervention) or usual care (control) for 14 days. Participants will&#xD;
      receive a two-week menu including all daily meals and provided with food bags containing all&#xD;
      the foods to be consumed. Primary outcome is glycemic control (specifically time in target)&#xD;
      measured using continuous glucose monitoring. Compliance to the dietary intervention will be&#xD;
      tested using known dietary biomarkers and adherence questionnaires. Maternal&#xD;
      socio-demographic and clinical data, biological samples, dietary intake and physical activity&#xD;
      will be collected at enrollment and at the end of intervention (30-32 weeks' gestation).&#xD;

    <description>Women randomized to the New Nordic Diet meet the study dietician at week 30 for 1.5 hr of individual diet treatment according to the New Nordic Diet and a cognitive behavioral approach. The diet advice include evenly distributed meals over the day, foods low in fat and rich in fibre, 500 g fruit and vegetables daily, fish 2-3 times a week and keyhole foods. Participants will prepare their own food but are provided with recipes and food bags containing all the foods to be consumed during the two-week intervention At gestational age 32 weeks, women meet with a dietitian and will be instructed to continue with the New Nordic Diet diet throughout pregnancy on their own.</description>

It includes rapeseed oil, whole grain bread, wild fish, seafood and game, potatoes, root vegetables, cabbages, Nordic fruits and berries. A two-week menu including all daily meals has been created to ensure dietary goals of the New Nordic Diet intervention: fish and shellfish intake ≥ 3 times/w (fatty fish at least once per week), ≥ 500 g fruit, berries, vegetables and legumes daily (legumes as main protein source at least twice per week), whole-grain cereal products, rapeseed oil for cooking/dressing and three table spoons of nuts and seeds per day.</description>
