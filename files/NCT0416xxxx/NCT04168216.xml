  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The intention with the study is to have a better understanding of what happens to COPD&#xD;
      patients' symptoms, lung function and markers of inflammation over 12 weeks. This information&#xD;
      will increase the understanding of COPD and how to design new treatments for COPD in the&#xD;
      future.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase IV, open-label, single-arm, single-site study. The purpose of this&#xD;
      exploratory study is to gain longitudinal insights into the relationships between the&#xD;
      inflammatory profile, symptoms, lung function, and reliever use in subjects with chronic&#xD;
      obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will include a minimum of 8 clinic visits and consist of a Screening Visit (Visit&#xD;
      1), a 4-week run-in period, a Baseline Visit (Visit 2) and a 12-week observational period,&#xD;
      including 6 visits scheduled every 2 weeks. To standardise the use of COPD medications all&#xD;
      subjects will receive maintenance Duaklir and reliever Ventolin for the duration of the&#xD;
      study. During the observational period, additional visits may occur if subjects experience a&#xD;
      worsening of their COPD symptoms. For each individual subject, the duration of participation&#xD;
      in the study will be 16 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Estimated study duration is approximately 20 months including approximately 50 patients.&#xD;

             staff and/or staff at the study site).&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. Judgment by the Investigator that the subject should not participate in the study if&#xD;
             the subject is unlikely to complete the observational period (eg, literacy, substance&#xD;
             abuse, life-threatening comorbidity).&#xD;
&#xD;
         14. Previous entry into the observation period in the present study.&#xD;
&#xD;
         15. For women only - currently pregnant (confirmed with positive pregnancy test),&#xD;
