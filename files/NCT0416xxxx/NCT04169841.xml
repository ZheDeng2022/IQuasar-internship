    <textblock>
      With the development of cost effective and rapid technology of genome sequencing, precision&#xD;
      medicine becomes a new way to think oncology. Current targets involve mainly tyrosine kinase,&#xD;
      but DNA repair machinery could also be targetable. Some of DNA repair aberrations have been&#xD;
      associated with sensitivity to platinum and poly (adenosine diphosphate [ADP]-ribose)&#xD;
      polymerase (PARP) inhibitors like Olaparib, suggesting that treatment with a PARP inhibitor&#xD;
      may exploit a synthetic lethal interaction when the presence of alteration of the homologous&#xD;
      repair pathway was observed. PARP is involved in multiple aspects of DNA repair, and the PARP&#xD;
      inhibitor Olaparib has recently been approved for treating ovarian cancers with BRCA1/2&#xD;
      mutations. In addition, it showed that using a high-throughput, next-generation sequencing&#xD;
      assay in prostate cancer, detection of genomic alteration in genes involved in homologous&#xD;
      repair pathway BRCA2, ATM, BRCA1, PALB2, CHEK2, FANCA, and HDAC2, is associated with response&#xD;
      to olaparib. Thus demonstrating the clinical validation of the usage of precision medicine to&#xD;
      position PARP inhibitor like olaparib in different cancer types based on molecular analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preclinical studies showed DNA damage promotes neoantigen expression. It is possible that&#xD;
      increased DNA damage by PARPi would yield greater mutational burden and expand neoantigen&#xD;
      expression, leading to greater immune recognition of the tumor. PARPi is also associated with&#xD;
      immunomodulation. The PARPi talazoparib increases the number of peritoneal CD8+ T cells and&#xD;
      natural killer cells and increases production of interferon (IFN)-γ and tumor necrosis&#xD;
      factor-α in a BRCA1-mutated ovarian cancer xenograft model. Hence, addition of PARPi to&#xD;
      immune checkpoint blockade could complement the clinical benefit of immune checkpoint&#xD;
      inhibition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Such high level of mutation results in high number of neoantigen and antitumor immune&#xD;
      response thus given the rational to use immunotherapy to target such type. A recent paper&#xD;
      validate this strategy using the anti PD-1 pembrolizumab Some case reports suggest also that&#xD;
      other mutations that induce hypermutated tumor (POLD, POLE, or MYH) could gain benefit from&#xD;
      anti PD-1 therapy. Additional DNA repair machinery dysfunction may lead to accumulation of&#xD;
      mutations. And such level of mutations could induce better response to immunotherapy. In the&#xD;
      lung non-small cell setting high mutation rate were associated with better efficacy of both&#xD;
      nivolumab and pembrolizumab.&#xD;
