    <textblock>
      Background. Rumination syndrome is characterized by effortless recurrent regurgitation of&#xD;
      recently ingested food into the mouth, with consequent expulsion or re-chewing and&#xD;
      swallowing. In a previous study we showed that rumination is produced by an unperceived,&#xD;
      somatic response to food ingestion. We developed an original biofeedback technique based on&#xD;
      electromyography-guided control of abdominothoracic muscular activity. In a randomized,&#xD;
      placebo-controlled trial we demonstrated the superiority of biofeedback over placebo for the&#xD;
      treatment of rumination. However, the technique is technically complex and unpractical.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim. To prove the efficacy of a simplified biofeedback technique for the treatment of&#xD;
      rumination. Selection criteria. Rumination after meal ingestion. Intervention. Patients will&#xD;
      be randomized into biofeedback in placebo groups. Three sessions of either biofeedback or&#xD;
      placebo intervention will be performed after ingestion of a probe meal during the first 3&#xD;
      weeks of the 4 weeks intervention period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Biofeedback: patients will be taught to control abdominal and thoracic muscular activity by&#xD;
      providing a visual display of the abdominal and thoracic perimeter; patients will be&#xD;
      instructed to perform the same exercises before and after breakfast, lunch and dinner during&#xD;
      the 4-week intervention period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Placebo: abdominal and thoracic perimeter will be recorded but not shown to the patient and a&#xD;
      pill of placebo containing 0.5 g glucose will be administered; patients will be instructed to&#xD;
      take a pill of placebo before breakfast, lunch and dinner during the 4-week intervention&#xD;
      period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Outcome Measure:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Number of rumination events measured by electromyography in response to the challenge meal&#xD;
      before and after treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Outcome Measures:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Number of self perceived rumination events measured by questionnaires administered daily&#xD;
           for 10 days will before and after treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Associated abdominal symptom measured by questionnaires administered daily for 10 days&#xD;
           before and after treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Follow up: number of self perceived rumination events measured at 1, 3 and 6 months&#xD;
           after treatment.&#xD;

    <description>Rumination events will be identified by recording the activity of the thoraco abdominal muscles (intercostals, external oblique, internal oblique, upper rectus, lower rectus) by electromyography after a challenge meal. The response to the meal will be measured before and after treatment.</description>
