  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a first-in-human, open-label, dose escalation, phase I clinical trial to assess the&#xD;
      safety and immunogenicity of the candidate ChAdOx2 RabG vaccine in healthy UK volunteers aged&#xD;
      18-65. The vaccine will be administered intramuscularly (IM).&#xD;

      Volunteers will be recruited and vaccinated at the Centre for Clinical Vaccinology and&#xD;
      Tropical Medicine (CCVTM), Oxford. There will be 3 study groups and it is anticipated that a&#xD;
      total of 12 volunteers will be enrolled. Staggered enrolment will apply between study groups&#xD;
      and for the first three volunteers within each group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study includes an optional extended follow-up period, lasting one month and starting one&#xD;
      year after vaccination. Volunteers will receive a complete pre-exposure prophylactic course&#xD;
      of an existing rabies vaccine, allowing study of the immunological memory (recall response)&#xD;
      induced by ChAdOx2 RabG. A second optional element of the study is the collection of saliva&#xD;
      samples at each visit for the study of shedding of EBV and CMV.&#xD;

             polymyxin, streptomycin, or to any antibiotics of the same groups will exclude&#xD;
             participants from receiving certain IRVs (as per the relevant SmPC) during the&#xD;
