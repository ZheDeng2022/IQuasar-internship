  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to find out whether the study drug, TSR-042, followed by&#xD;
      standard chemoradiotherapy (the chemotherapy drug capecitabine + radiation therapy) and&#xD;
      standard surgery is an effective treatment for advanced dMMR solid tumors. The study will&#xD;
      also look at the safety of the study drug.&#xD;

    <description>Patients with clinical Stage II or Stage III MRI-staged, MSI-H or dMMR, solid tumors will receive up to 6 months (9, 21-day cycles) of PD-1 blockade followed by radiological and surgical restaging of the tumor. If subject exhibits complete clinical response, non-operative management will be followed. If a complete clinical response is not reached after 6 months of PD-1 blockade, the participant will proceed with standard chemoradiation. After completing chemoradiation participant will be assessed for response if complete CR is not obtained then the participant will proceed with disease specific surgical resection or standard of care therapy.</description>
