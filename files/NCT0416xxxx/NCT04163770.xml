  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pacemakers were introduced into clinical practice several decades ago and currently are used&#xD;
      in a growing number of patients. Since insertion of the first cardiac Pacemaker in 1958, vast&#xD;
      changes have occurred in both the technology of the devices and their indications. Devices&#xD;
      have evolved from single-lead and fixed-rate systems to multi chamber rate-responsive systems&#xD;
      with increasingly sophisticated software .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pediatric Pacemaker implants comprise less than 1 % of all implants. The indications for&#xD;
      pacing in newborns and infants are divided predominantly into three groups: congenital&#xD;
      abnormalities of the conduction system, acquired heart blocks after cardiac surgery for&#xD;
      correction of congenital defects, and sinus node diseases&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Although advances in device and lead technology have expanded the ability to implant&#xD;
      pacemakers and defibrillators in children and patients with congenital heart disease , a&#xD;
      number of challenges exist that can complicate long-term pacing success in this unique&#xD;
      population . These include a long duration of pacing need, a more active lifestyle in young&#xD;
      patients, somatic growth, congenital cardiac abnormalities, and relatively small patient and&#xD;
      vessel size. Traditional stylet driven leads have limited maneuverability, making lead&#xD;
      placement in smaller patients and those with structural abnormalities more challenging.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additionally, the larger lead diameter needed to accommodate the stylet has been correlated&#xD;
      with increased risk of venous complications in children . Furthermore, many congenital heart&#xD;
      disease patients have structural abnormalities and cardiac scarring that require pacing leads&#xD;
      to be placed in non-standard locations, and selective site pacing can be difficult to achieve&#xD;
      with stylet-driven leads .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pacing therapy in children must take into account several unique pediatric issues: (1) small&#xD;
      physique; (2) somatic growth; (3) presence of intracardiac shunts; and (4) a complex&#xD;
      anatomical heart structure. It is important to understand these features when deciding&#xD;
      whether pacing is indicated, as well as when selecting the time to implant and how to&#xD;
      implant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The 2008 Guidelines of the American College of Cardiology /American Heart Association /Heart&#xD;
      Rhythm Society summarize indications for pacing treatment in children. Atrioventricular block&#xD;
      including congenital atrioventricular block associated with cardiac surgery or a natural&#xD;
      history of complex congenital heart disease such as corrected transposition of the great&#xD;
      arteries are the most important indications for pacemaker implantation in children 8-13. In&#xD;
      pediatric patients, atrioventricular block that does not recover within 7-10 days after&#xD;
      cardiac surgery is associated with a risk of sudden cardiac death in the future, so pacemaker&#xD;
      implantation is recommended.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dual-chamber pacemakers are often selected for adult patients with atrioventricular block.&#xD;
      Dual-chamber pacemakers pacing requires two endocardial leads. In infants, this presents a&#xD;
      problem because the venous diameter is small and may cause venous obstruction. A single&#xD;
      chamber ventricular pacemaker instead of a dual-chamber pacemaker is a good alternative&#xD;
      choice in children with complete atrioventricular block and normal sinus node function,&#xD;
      because it requires only a single lead and may reduce the possibility of venous occlusion.&#xD;
      The high heart rate of infants is another issue. The mean heart rate of an infant is 100 bpm&#xD;
      or faster, increasing to 180-200 bpm or above when crying. In an infant with atrioventricular&#xD;
      block, the atrial rate becomes so rapid that it may exceed the maximum programmable upper&#xD;
      tracking rate, which is limited by the post-ventricular atrial refractory period and&#xD;
      atrioventricular delay. Under the condition where the atrial heart rate exceeds the maximum&#xD;
      programmable upper tracking rate, symptomatic 2:1 atrioventricular block may occur.&#xD;
      Therefore, in infants with a small body size and a rapid ventricular rate, single chamber&#xD;
      ventricular pacing or single-chamber ventricular pacing with rate response should be&#xD;
      selected.&#xD;
