  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The iParent2Parent program matches parents of children living with arthritis with a trained&#xD;
      parent mentor who will provide parents of children newly diagnosed with arthritis: practical&#xD;
      coping advice and social support through shared lived experiences. This study will compare&#xD;
      two groups of parents: those who are in the iParent2Parent program and those in the control&#xD;
      group (no mentor).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Parents/primary caregiver of children with JIA are an often overlooked but essential member&#xD;
      of their child's health care team. They are responsible for managing their child's treatment&#xD;
      program, and act as advocates for their child to support positive adaptation to JIA and to&#xD;
      learn self-management skills for the disease. This is in the context of managing the&#xD;
      financial, logistical, emotional, and social demands of parenting in general. Within&#xD;
      pediatric tertiary care centres, peer-support programs for parents of children with JIA are&#xD;
      often limited or difficult to access. The iParent2Parent Program aims to fill this gap in&#xD;
      services by offering a program of trained parent peer mentors who can provide practical&#xD;
      coping advice, foster adaptive problem solving, and provide social support via shared lived&#xD;
      experience.&#xD;

    <measure>Trial feasibility of iParent2Parent program</measure>
    <time_frame>At study completion; an average of 2 years</time_frame>
    <description>Criteria for feasibility are based on studies previously conducted by our group and will be: accrual rate of &gt;70 percent, attrition rate of &lt;15percent, technical difficulties reported by &lt;10 percent of parents and mentors, adherence rate of &gt;80 percent, &lt;5 percent missed responses on outcome measures and high acceptability (based on qualitative analyses). Data related to the primary outcome will be recorded on investigator-developed forms.</description>
