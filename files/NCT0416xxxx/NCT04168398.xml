      INTRODUCTION:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Atherothrombotic disorders of the cerebrovascular, coronary, and peripheral arterial&#xD;
      circulation, affect nearly 20-30% of those older than 70 years of age and are among the&#xD;
      leading causes of death and disability in the world. Individuals with peripheral artery&#xD;
      disease (PAD), referring to arterial vascular disease of the extremities, have the greatest&#xD;
      risk of experiencing cardiovascular death and myocardial infarction when compared to those&#xD;
      with coronary artery disease or cerebrovascular disease alone PAD usually signals more&#xD;
      systemic atherosclerotic disease and often goes undiagnosed and undertreated, which is&#xD;
      thought to be a major reason for why these patients have been found to be at increased risk&#xD;
      for major adverse cardiovascular events and mortality. One of the major goals of antiplatelet&#xD;
      therapy is for prevention, both primary and secondary, of acute thrombotic events. Despite&#xD;
      the increased local and systemic cardiovascular risk in PAD patients, the literature on the&#xD;
      most effective antiplatelet regimen and its recommended duration are lacking, especially&#xD;
      compared to studies primarily focusing on coronary artery disease. The major consensus&#xD;
      guidelines for PAD suggest using mono antiplatelet therapy in PAD but state that the data&#xD;
      either for or against the use of DAPT in this population are too limited to make strong&#xD;
      recommendations. There has been an attempt to update the international TASC guidelines but&#xD;
      disagreement among the societies has delayed a universally accepted TASC III document. After&#xD;
      PAD revascularization, corresponding risks are even higher, with reported rates of nonfatal&#xD;
      MI, ischemic stroke, or cardiovascular death 36 months after procedure of 14% among patients&#xD;
      with IC and 34% among those with CLI. These risks are further elevated after repeat limb&#xD;
      revascularization, supporting the need for more aggressive secondary prevention measures,&#xD;
      including intensive antithrombotic therapy, to prevent recurrent events in this high-risk&#xD;
      population. Despite the greater risk of cardiovascular and limb adverse outcomes in patients&#xD;
      with PAD undergoing limb revascularization, high-quality data on antithrombotic therapy in&#xD;
      this clinical context are sparse. As a result, recommendations regarding antithrombotic&#xD;
      therapy for these patients are based on lower levels of evidence and are inconsistent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Until now no clinical trial had reported the use of AAT (Apixiban aspirin therapy) after&#xD;
      lower limb revascularization therefore, the purpose of this study is to evaluate and compare&#xD;
      the effect of CAT (Clopidogrel aspirin therapy) and AAT (Apixiban aspirin therapy) at time of&#xD;
      discharge, on survival following lower extremity revascularization and major adverse effects&#xD;
      Aim of the work compare the effect of CAT (Clopidogrel aspirin therapy) and AAT (Apixiban&#xD;
      aspirin therapy) after lower extremity revascularization.&#xD;
