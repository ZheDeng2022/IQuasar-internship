      This multi-centre study will compare the acceptability, feasibility, cost and incremental&#xD;
      cost-effectiveness of intermittent preventive treatment (IPTp) with&#xD;
      dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine (DP) with or without azithromycin to the current strategy of&#xD;
      IPTp with sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) to prevent malaria, sexually transmitted and&#xD;
      reproductive tract infections in HIV-uninfected pregnant women (IMPROVE).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>

      Primary objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To assess the acceptability, costs and incremental cost-effectiveness of IPTp-DP, with&#xD;
           or without AZ, compared to current policy of IPTp-SP in HIV-uninfected pregnant women.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To assess the feasibility of delivering IPTp-DP with or without a targeted information&#xD;
           transfer intervention among HIV-uninfected pregnant women attending ANC in the routine&#xD;
           health system i.e. non-trial settings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Acceptability, costs and incremental cost-effectiveness will be assessed in the context of&#xD;
      the IMPROVE clinical trial in Kenya, Malawi and Tanzania (see NCT02909712).&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will also conduct an 'implementation feasibility' study in the routine setting in adjacent&#xD;
      sites to the IMPROVE trial site in Kenya (only), using a 3-arm cluster randomized design to&#xD;
      assess systems effectiveness, implementation strength, scalability, and identify potential&#xD;
      operational hurdles for scale up. Ministry of health nurses providing routine ANC services&#xD;
      will be trained to provide IPTp-DP or given refresher training for current policy (IPTp-SP).&#xD;
      The interventions will be implemented for a period of 10 months. Approximately 5-6 months&#xD;
      after the start of implementation, delivery effectiveness will be assessed through exit&#xD;
      interviews with pregnant women leaving ANC clinics. Women who receive the correct doses of&#xD;
      the interventions will be followed up at home 4-5 days after their clinic visit (i.e. no more&#xD;
      than 2 days after their 3-day regimen finished) and interviewed about adherence, including&#xD;
      pill counts. The quantitative study will be supplemented by a qualitative study to explain&#xD;
      the quantitative outcomes and to assess perceptions of scalability of the interventions&#xD;
      tested.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Feasibility study Interventions:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Monthly IPTp regimens: Arm 1. Standard single-day stat course of quality-assured SP; Arm 2.&#xD;
      Standard 3-day course of 3 to 5 tablets (40/320mg) of DP per day based on bodyweight&#xD;
      (Eurartesim®, AlfaSigma, Italy); Arm 3. Same as 2, with additional job aids and IEC&#xD;
      materials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome Measures&#xD;
&#xD;
      Feasibility study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Outcome - Adherence assessed through home visits: Proportion of pregnant women&#xD;
      attending ANC who receive the first dose of IPTp by DOT and the correct number of tablets for&#xD;
      subsequent doses (IPTp-DP) visited at home and who have verified they completed the&#xD;
      treatment. Where IPTp-SP is given by DOT this is assumed as 100% adherence and that the&#xD;
      correct dosage is given.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcome - Delivery effectiveness assessed by exit interviews with pregnant women&#xD;
      leaving ANC: Proportion of pregnant women attending ANC for their first and second visit in&#xD;
      their second or third trimester who receive an appropriate dose with each drug/drug&#xD;
      combination. For the IPTp-DP arm, women will be asked whether the first dose was given by DOT&#xD;
      and the correct number of tablets for subsequent doses available on exit. For IPTp-SP the&#xD;
      full dose should be given by DOT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample sizes:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Feasibility exit interviews (delivery rate): 1,485 pregnant women Feasibility home visits&#xD;
      (adherence rate): 744 pregnant women sampled from women enrolled in exit interviews&#xD;
      Acceptability among pregnant women: approx. 90 Acceptability among health providers:&#xD;
      approx.90&#xD;
