&#xD;
         13. Presence of active gastrointestinal disease or other condition that will impair&#xD;
             significantly with the absorption, distribution, metabolism, or excretion of CS3002.&#xD;
&#xD;
         14. Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, known ongoing or&#xD;
             active infection, including HIV, active hepatitis B or C.&#xD;

             (HBcAb) positive, or Hepatitis C virus (HCV) antibody positive at screening, must not&#xD;
             be enrolled until further definite testing with Hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA titres and&#xD;
             HCV RNA tests can conclusively rule out presence of active infection (HBV DNA ≥1000&#xD;
             cps/mL or 200 IU/mL; HCV RNA exceeding the lower detection limit) requiring antiviral&#xD;
             therapy with Hepatitis B and C, respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
         16. QTc interval &gt; 480 msec (based on the mean value of the triplicate screening ECG);&#xD;
             family or personal history of long or short QT syndrome; history of ventricular&#xD;
             dysrhythmias or risk factors for ventricular dysrhythmias such as structural heart&#xD;
             disease (e.g., severe left ventricular systolic dysfunction, left ventricular&#xD;
             hypertrophy), coronary heart disease (symptomatic or with ischemia demonstrated by&#xD;
             diagnostic testing), clinically significant electrolyte abnormalities (e.g.,&#xD;
             hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, hypocalcemia).&#xD;
&#xD;
         17. Known or suspected active alcohol or drug abuse.&#xD;
&#xD;
         18. Other acute or chronic medical or psychiatric condition including recent (within the&#xD;
             past year) or active suicidal ideation or behavior or laboratory abnormality that may&#xD;
             increase the risk associated with study participation or investigational product&#xD;
             administration or may interfere with the interpretation of study results and, in the&#xD;
             judgment of the investigator, would make the subject inappropriate for entry into this&#xD;
             study.&#xD;
&#xD;
         19. Females who are pregnant or lactating.&#xD;
