  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: Nowadays, the use of connective tissue graft associated to the coronally advanced&#xD;
      flap is considered the &quot;gold standard&quot; for localized gingival recession treatment. However,&#xD;
      this technique requires a donor site, which can be associated with greater morbidity. The use&#xD;
      of platelet concentrates, particularly the Leukocytes- and Platelets Rich Fibrin (L-PRF), it&#xD;
      has emerged as an alternative for gingival recession treatment, due to its properties which&#xD;
      enhance the regenerative process. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to evaluate and to&#xD;
      compare the effect obtained with L-PRF versus connective tissue graft (CTG) associated to the&#xD;
      Coronally Advanced Flap (CAF) in the treatment of Miller class I or II localized gingival&#xD;
      recessions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: A randomized controlled clinical trial of parallel groups (1:1) with 17 recessions&#xD;
      in each group was performed. Control group (CAF + CTG) and test group (CAF + L-PRF). In each&#xD;
      group the following variable were measured: postoperative pain and incidence of post-surgical&#xD;
      complications at 24-48-72 hours, gingival recession depth (RD), gingival recession width&#xD;
      (RW), gingival thickness (GT), probing depth (PD), clinical insertion level (NIC),&#xD;
      keratinized tissue height (KTH) before treatment and after 1, 3 and 6 months of root covering&#xD;
      surgery and the root coverage esthetic score (RES) at 6 months after treatment.&#xD;

      Study design and participants A randomized controlled clinical trial of parallel groups (1:1)&#xD;
      with 17 recessions in each group was performed. Control group (CAF + CTG) and test group (CAF&#xD;
      + L-PRF). This study was approved by the ethical committee of Universidad de Los Andes,&#xD;
      Santiago Chile (CEC201627) and in full accordance with the ethical principles of the&#xD;
      Declaration of Helsinki, as revisited in 2000. The patients were instructed about the&#xD;
      benefits and risks of the study and each participant signed an informed consent form.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thirteen patients (9 females and 4 males; aged 26 to 53 years; mean year: 41,74; SD: 9,11&#xD;
      years) with a total of 34 gingival recession (27 in females and 7 in males) participated in&#xD;
      the present study. (Figure 1)&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sample size was based on the detection of 1 mm difference in gingival recession reduction&#xD;
      between the treatment groups (standard deviation 0.93), with a two-sided 5% significance&#xD;
      level, a power of 85%.(36) The sample size calculation was obtained using the software STATA&#xD;
      v14.0.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Initial therapy and clinical measurements The patient enrolled received a prophylaxis session&#xD;
      (scaling and professional tooth cleaning), all patients had less of 20% of plaque or 80% oral&#xD;
      hygiene according to the O´Leary oral hygiene index.(37) All clinical parameters measurements&#xD;
      were performed by a single trained and calibrated examiner (C.A.) and masked for the&#xD;
      treatment assigned. An Individual acrylic stents were prepared for all patients to take&#xD;
      measurements of the constant points.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following parameters were evaluated at baseline and 1, 3, and 6 months after treatment:&#xD;
      1) gingival recession depth (RD), distance between CEJ and gingival margin (GM); 2) gingival&#xD;
      recession wide (RW), measured at CEJ level; 3) probing depth (PD), measured from margin of&#xD;
      the gingiva to the gingival sulcus base; 4) clinical attachment level (CAL), measured from&#xD;
      the CEJ to the gingival sulcus base; 5) keratinized tissue height (KTH), measured from the&#xD;
      mucogingival junction to the gingival margin; 6) gingival thickness (GT) at 3 mm from the&#xD;
      gingival margin, measured un local anesthesia with an endodontic spacer Nº 25 with its&#xD;
      stopper silicone disc and an endodontic rule; 7) root coverage (RC) was calculated in&#xD;
      millimeters and percentages according to the following formula: [(pre-operative RD -&#xD;
      post-operative RD)/pre-operative RD] × 100.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PD, CAL, and KTH measurements were performed at the mid-buccal aspect of the teeth, by a&#xD;
      manual probe and were rounded up to the nearest millimeter.(7)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient Evaluation of Postoperative Morbidity and Esthetics Pain score using a 100-mm visual&#xD;
      analogue scale (VAS) (0 indicating no pain, 50 indicating average, and 100 indicating an&#xD;
      unbearable pain) and the incidence of complications post-surgery (such as hematoma, swelling,&#xD;
      bleeding, infection, wound dehiscence, etc.) responding dichotomous questions, were&#xD;
      registered at 24, 48 and 72 hours after the surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The root coverage esthetic score (RES) was evaluated at 6 months according to the protocol of&#xD;
      Cairo et al.(38).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Surgical treatment Prior to starting the surgery, the surgeon opened the envelope labeled&#xD;
      with the assigned treatment. All surgeries were performed by a single expert periodontist&#xD;
      (A.S.). Under local anesthesia, the root area corresponding to buccal attachment loss&#xD;
      (gingival recession + buccal PD) was instrumented with Gracey curettes until obtain a&#xD;
      polished surface. Then, the surface was washed with a saline solution for 30 seconds.&#xD;
      Additionally, a chemical treatment of the root surface for 3 minutes was done using&#xD;
      Tetracycline HCl (250 mg/ml), mixing 250 mg in 1 ml of sterile water. After that, the root&#xD;
      surface was rinsed for 60 seconds with saline solution.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The CAF was made following the protocol described by Zucchelli et al. in 2007. (39). Two&#xD;
      horizontal beveled incision were done at mesial and distal of the gingival recession (each&#xD;
      one 3 mm in length) at a distance from the tip of the anatomical papillae equal to the depth&#xD;
      of the recession plus 1 mm. Both incisions were connected with an intrasulcular incision.&#xD;
      From the horizontal incisions, two beveled obliques, slightly divergent, incisions were&#xD;
      extended until the alveolar mucosa. Then, the trapezoidal-shaped flap, split-full-split from&#xD;
      coronal to apical was elevated and the papillae (mesial and distal) were deepithelialized.&#xD;
      When the margin of the flap was able to passively extend until more coronal of the CEJ the&#xD;
      coronal mobilization of the flap was considered satisfactory.&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to the treatment assignment (control or test group), a connective tissue graft or a&#xD;
      double L-PRF membrane was positioned at the level of CEJ, getting the stabilization with 5-0&#xD;
      resorbable suture. After that, the flap was coronally advanced and stabilized with&#xD;
      interrupted sutures (5-0 resorbable) anchored to incisal contact points (mesial and distal)&#xD;
      created with a flowable, light-curing resin material in the treated tooth. Finally, a gentle&#xD;
      pression over the area with a moistened gauze with saline solution was performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      L-PRF preparation 2 vacutainer tubes of 10 ml without anticoagulant of blood were obtained&#xD;
      and centrifuged at 408 g for 12 minutes using a table centrifuge (IntraSpinTM, Intralock,&#xD;
      Florida, USA) according to the protocol described by Temmerman et al. in 2016.(40) The L-PRF&#xD;
      clots obtained were removed from the tube, separated of the red cells and located inside of&#xD;
      Xpression box (IntraSpinTM, Intralock, Florida, USA) to convert them into membranes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The two L-PRF membranes obtained were attached using a resorbable suture until obtain only&#xD;
      one thicker and stable membrane. (Figure 2)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Postsurgical indications and control pain Ketoprofen 100 mg was administrated immediately&#xD;
      before the surgery. Then, they took the same prescription every 12 hours for the next 2 days.&#xD;
      In some specific cases, the prescription was extended to control pain and the extra doses was&#xD;
      registered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients received written and oral instructions about not touch the involved area, only&#xD;
      liquid diet and do not make any hard effort or sports activity during two weeks until the&#xD;
      sutures were removed. Related to oral hygiene after surgery, the patients were also&#xD;
      instructed to not brush their treated teeth, just rinse with Chlorhexidine solution (0.12%)&#xD;
      three times a day for 1 min. After suture removal, the chlorhexidine rinsing was maintained&#xD;
      for additional 2 weeks. After that, the patients were again instructed with a -traumatic&#xD;
      tooth brushing technique.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization, Allocation Concealment, and Calibration Computer-Generated randomization was&#xD;
      used to assign the patients with an allocation ratio of 1:1 into two study groups: CAF +&#xD;
      L-PRF (17 gingival recession; control) and CAF + CTG (17 gingival recession; test). To&#xD;
      conceal the treatment assignment, opaque envelopes containing the name of the intervention&#xD;
      were used. During the intra-examiner calibration period, a 90% level of calibration (K&#xD;
      coefficient = 0.90) was detected after triplicate measurement of gingival recession depth&#xD;
      (GRD), distance from the CEJ to the margin of the gingiva, in 50 recession defects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis Descriptive analysis was expressed as mean and standard deviation (SD)&#xD;
      or median and interquartile range (IQR) according to distribution of data (normality)&#xD;
      determinate by Shapiro-Wilk test. Student's t-test was used to evaluate differences between&#xD;
      baseline measures and different evaluations times of variables expresses as mean, in the&#xD;
      variables expresses as median was used the Wilcoxon test was applied. Categorical measurement&#xD;
      was analyzed by Chi-square test. A p-value &lt; 0.05 considered as significant in all tests. The&#xD;
      analysis was performed with Stata software v.12, Stata Corp, College Station, TX.&#xD;
