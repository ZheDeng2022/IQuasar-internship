    <textblock>
      HydroEye® is a dietary supplement that contains both EPA and DHA, as well as GLA and ALA in&#xD;
      the form of black currant seed oil. It also has vitamins A, E, C, B6, and magnesium, many of&#xD;
      which are involved in fatty acid metabolism. In 2013, Sheppard et al. tested HydroEye® in dry&#xD;
      eye patients who were not contact lens wearers and found that symptoms and corneal smoothness&#xD;
      improved in response to HydroEye® supplementation. To date, HydroEye® has not been assessed&#xD;
      in patients with contact lens discomfort; therefore, the purpose of this clinical trial is to&#xD;
      determine the efficacy of HydroEye® as a treatment for contact lens discomfort.&#xD;
