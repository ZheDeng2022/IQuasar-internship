      Research purpose: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of Wenxin granules in treating atrial&#xD;
      premature beats by different doses, to provide a scientific basis for rational clinical use&#xD;
      of drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research design: A Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, four dose groups,&#xD;
      post-marketing clinical trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The ratio of high, medium and low dose groups and placebo group were 1:1:1:1. A total of 60&#xD;
      cases were included in the first phase.The maximum sample size required was determined to be&#xD;
      150 cases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therapeutic schedule:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Low-dose Group(1/2 Normal-dose Wenxin Granules ):Wenxin Granules (no sucrose) 2.5g +&#xD;
           Wenxin Granules placebo 7.5g.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Medium-dose Group(Normal-dose Wenxin Granules ):Wenxin Granules (no sucrose) 5g + Wenxin&#xD;
           Granules placebo 5g.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. High-dose Group(Twice Normal-dose Wenxin Granules):Wenxin Granules (no sucrose) 10g.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Placebo Group(Placebo):Wenxin Granules placebo 10g.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Usage and Dosage:The drugs should be taken 10 g orally each time, 3 times a day after meals,&#xD;
      for 4 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Drug combination:&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the test should not merge the other anti-arrhythmic drugs beyond the provisions of&#xD;
      this scheme. Due to merger disease or condition changes ,have to use drugs or other&#xD;
      treatment, investigators must record the types (or other treatment ),drug usage, time and&#xD;
      reasons, in order to summarize ,analyze and report.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Outcome Measures&#xD;
&#xD;
      1. Responder rate based on 24-hour Holter monitoring, defined as the proportion (%) of&#xD;
      subjects with a ≥ 50% reduction in atrial premature beats during 24-hour Holter monitoring&#xD;
      from baseline.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Time Frame: Week 0 to Week 4&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Outcome Measures&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Change in Total Score From Baseline in Traditional Chinese Medicine Syndrome Score Scale&#xD;
           (TCMSSS).&#xD;
&#xD;
           Time Frame: Week 0 to Week 4&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Responder rate based on each symptom score, defined as the proportion (%) of subjects&#xD;
           with a ≥ 1 score reduction in each symptom score from baseline.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Time Frame: Week 0 to Week 4&#xD;
&#xD;
      Other Outcome Measures&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Number of participants with treatment-related adverse events as assessed by CTCAE v4.0&#xD;
           Time Frame: Week 0 to Week 4&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Impact of treatment on Liver Function Time Frame: Week 0 to Week 4&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Impact of treatment on Renal Function Time Frame: Week 0 to Week 4&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Impact of treatment on Hemoglobin Levels Time Frame: Week 0 to Week 4&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Impact of treatment on White Blood Cells Time Frame: Week 0 to Week 4&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Impact of treatment on Blood Platelet Time Frame: Week 0 to Week 4&#xD;
&#xD;

    <masking_description>This study was a double-blind clinical trial, with the patients, the treating physicians, the statisticians, the monitors and any other personnel being unaware of group allocation. Efforts to maintain blinding included identical appearance, packaging and labeling of four groups of experimental drugs.&#xD;
Unblinding should be done by the statisticians when the data collection process was completed or the treating physicians when serious adverse events occurred.&#xD;

    <description>The rating scale consisted of 12 items (1 for the main symptoms and 11 for the accompanying symptoms) with 4 options (absent, mild, moderate or severe) for each item. Each option was represented by a fixed score(0,1,2,3), the higher the score, the more severe the symptom, and vice versa. The total score of the rating scale was called syndrome integral.&#xD;
Symptoms include palpitation, chest distress, chest pain, shortness of breath, lack of strength, insomnia, dreamfulness, dizziness, dim complexion, vexing heat in chest, palms and soles, dry mouth, cyanotic lips and nails.&#xD;
The changes of TCM syndrome scores before and after treatment were compared.</description>
