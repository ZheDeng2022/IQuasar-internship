  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The use of antagonist ovulation stimulation program is increasing year by year, because of&#xD;
      its convenience, flexibility, and prevention effect of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome.&#xD;
      However, many researchers and clinicians believe that the clinical outcomes of antagonist&#xD;
      regimens are worse than those of classical long-term regimens. Studies showed that the&#xD;
      reasons for that maybe antagonist protocol results in poor effect on oocytes maturation or&#xD;
      endometrial receptivity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At present, the trigger time of antagonist regimen is more than three follicles with&#xD;
      diameters of ≥17 mm, which makes the duration of gonadotrophin application in antagonist&#xD;
      regimen is shorter than that of long regimen. Whether the trigger time of antagonist regimen&#xD;
      is too early to cause adverse effects on oocytes, embryos and eventual clinical outcomes is&#xD;
      unknown.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study hopes to compare regular trigger timing and two days delay of trigger in ovarian&#xD;
      stimulations by antagonist protocol，in order to study whether delay two days of trigger will&#xD;
      get better clinical outcomes than regular trigger timing in ovarian stimulations by&#xD;
      antagonist protocol in in vitro fertilization (IVF)/Intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The results of this study will help infertile couples and clinicians to know and choose the&#xD;
      optimal treatment in antagonist protocol.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to conduct a single center clinical trial, to study whether&#xD;
      delay two days of trigger will obtain more good-quality embryos than regular trigger timing&#xD;
      in ovarian stimulations by antagonist protocol in in vitro fertilization. Which may further&#xD;
      improve culmulative live birth rate (CLBR). The results of this study will help infertile&#xD;
      couples and clinicians to know and choose the optimal treatment in antagonist protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We plan a single center, open-label, randomized controlled clinical trial (1:1 treatment&#xD;
      ratio). On the day of regular trigger timing day (three follicles reach 17mm) or two days&#xD;
      later. 36-38 hours after trigger, oocyte retrieval will be applying in both group with same&#xD;
      protocol. Then IVF/ICSI and embryo culture with standard protocol in assisted reproductive&#xD;
      treatments in our center will be implemented similarly. Information of all participants and&#xD;
      outcomes are recorded in the case report form. The flow chart followed SPIRIT checklist&#xD;
      showing enrollment, allocation, treatment, and follow-up of participants.&#xD;

           necessary to discontinue their study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Loss to follow-up. Recruitment Infertile couples who come to outpatient clinic will be&#xD;
           screened as part of routine assessment by trained clinical team who are very familiar&#xD;
           with the eligible criteria. Eligible patients will then be approached by a member of the&#xD;
           research team and explained the trial details before controlled ovarian hyperstimulation&#xD;
           (COH). After this information, couples will be offered time for consideration to decide&#xD;
           to participate the trial. If the couple agrees to participate, they will make an&#xD;
           appointment to sign the consent before COH. Couples that refuse participation, will&#xD;
           receive conventional care. An individual record of all non-recruited patients and&#xD;
           reasons for exclusion will be obtained and storage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Controlled ovarian hyperstimulation All patients will receive fixed antagonist protocol of&#xD;
      COH treatment, which is performed by standard routines at each study center. Treatment will&#xD;
      start on day 2 or day 3 of the spontaneous menstrual cycle, and the baseline pelvic&#xD;
      ultrasound, as well as basic serum hormones (such as FSH, luteinizing hormone (LH),&#xD;
      progesterone (P) and β-hCG) will be tested to confirm the folic status. All participants will&#xD;
      be subcutaneous injected rFSH. The initial dosage of rFSH is 200IU and the subsequent dose&#xD;
      will be adjusted according to the ovary status. Transvaginal B-mode ultrasound, urinary LH,&#xD;
      and serum E2 will be tested to monitor follicle growth. On day 5 of stimulation, GnRH&#xD;
      antagonist 0.25mg daily will be administered subcutaneously until the trigger day (include&#xD;
      the trigger day). Group A of trigger is 3 or more follicles reach a diameter ≥17 mm, Group B&#xD;
      of trigger is 2 days later than group A with continually Gn. For all patients，GnRH agonist&#xD;
      0.2 + hCG 2000IU will be once injected on trigger day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Oocyte retrieval and preparation Oocyte retrieval is scheduled for 36h (±2) after hCG&#xD;
      injection. Routine oocyte pick-up is performed under Transvaginal ultrasound guidance via 17G&#xD;
      oocyte aspiration needle with use of intravenous sedation. The retrieved cumulus oocyte&#xD;
      complexes (COC) will be allocated to undergo conventional IVF or ICSI. For both groups, the&#xD;
      COCs are placed in culture medium covered by lightweight paraffin oil and incubated in a&#xD;
      humidified 37℃,5% CO2 incubator after oocyte retrieval immediately. Besides of this, the COCs&#xD;
      are incubated for 2-6h before insemination or injection. For group B (ICSI group), the&#xD;
      oocytes will be denuded by hyaluronidase before micromanipulation. Only the mature,&#xD;
      metaphase-Ⅱ(MⅡ) oocytes with an extruded first polar body are microinjected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessment of fertilization and embryo quality Assessment of fertilization are carried out&#xD;
      about 16-18h (day 1) after fertilization. Oocytes are classed as fertilized if two pronuclei&#xD;
      (2PN) are present and the second polar body has been extruded. Other oocytes are classified&#xD;
      as abnormally fertilized (0PN, 1PN, 3PN). Normal fertilization rate will be always calculated&#xD;
      as the number 2PN over the number of COCs, independent of the nuclear maturity, as well for&#xD;
      IVF as for ICSI. After the evaluation on day 1, zygotes are left in culture for a further 48&#xD;
      hours, and the cleavage embryo quality will be observed at 72 (day 3) hours after oocyte&#xD;
      retrieval. The embryos are scored according to the quality, numbers, size of the blastomeres&#xD;
      and the amount of anucleate fragmentation as follow criteria: Grade 1 embryos consist of&#xD;
      symmetrical blastomeres of approximately equal size and without anucleate fragments. Grade 2&#xD;
      embryos had blastomeres of even or uneven size and have &lt;10% of the volume of embryos filled&#xD;
      with anucleate fragments. Grade 3 embryos have anucleate fragments occupying between 10% and&#xD;
      50% of the volume of the embryos. Grade 4 embryos have anucleate fragments &gt;50% of the volume&#xD;
      of the embryos.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Embryo transfer and luteal support All cycles are freeze all cycles. Evaluation of pregnancy&#xD;
      Urine and blood hCG will be measured 14 days after embryo transfer, and positive results&#xD;
      indicate biochemical pregnancy. If the gestational sac is observed with ultrasonography on&#xD;
      7weeks after transfer, clinical pregnancy will be confirmed. Ongoing pregnancy is defined by&#xD;
      the presence of a gestational sac with fetal heartbeat after 12 weeks of gestation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up For women not diagnosed pregnant in the initial cycle, they will be considered as a&#xD;
      negative for outcome in our trial, and subsequently be treated another IVF/ICSI cycle or are&#xD;
      evaluated as not suitable for further ART, based on the physician's decision.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For women who are confirmed as ongoing pregnancy, we will arrange 3 telephone interviews&#xD;
      during their pregnancy via specific trained nurses. At 12 weeks, 28 weeks, and 37 weeks of&#xD;
      gestation (in terms of first-trimester pregnancy, second-trimester pregnancy, and&#xD;
      third-trimester pregnancy), pregnancy complications, and fetus information will be collected&#xD;
      and recorded to complete the case report form (CRF) comprehensively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be required to notify researchers of the time of delivery. In 2 weeks after&#xD;
      delivery, the delivery information (gestational age, delivery mode, placenta abnormality&#xD;
      and/or delivery complications), infant information (such as sex, birth weight, birth defect)&#xD;
      will be collected by completing forms designed for this visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After informed consent obtained, researchers should collect the demographic characteristics,&#xD;
      medical record, and vital signs from participants, including birth date, age, height, weight,&#xD;
      household income and occupation for demographic characteristics; disease history, operation&#xD;
      history and personal history for medical record; body temperature and blood pressure for&#xD;
      vital signs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline characteristics of patient's accessory examination, such as chest radiograph,&#xD;
      electrocardiogram (ECG), liver enzyme, renal function, HBV/HCV/HIV negative status, syphilis&#xD;
      detection, et al.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the study procedures, laboratory tests should be obtained to confirm the eligible&#xD;
      criteria and collect study information, including serum sex hormone (E2, LH, FSH, PRL, P, T),&#xD;
      ultrasonography, semen analysis, and pregnancy test. Other laboratory indexs will be tested&#xD;
      during conventional clinical treatment but not recorded in our study.&#xD;
