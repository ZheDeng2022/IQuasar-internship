  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is intended to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Nerivio, an FDA-authorized&#xD;
      remote electrical neuromodulation (REN) device for the acute treatment of migraine, for the&#xD;
      acute treatment of migraine in people with chronic migraine. The device delivers&#xD;
      transcutaneous electrical stimulation to the upper arm to induce conditioned pain modulation&#xD;
      (CPM) that activates a descending endogenous analgesic mechanism. The study duration consists&#xD;
      of a 4 weeks of active treatment with the device in about 40 patients.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This open label study includes up to 2 visits. The enrollment and device training may occur&#xD;
      in 2 separate visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      First visit - The first visit will include screening, enrollment and training on the&#xD;
      application and device.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment phase - Participants will be instructed to use the device for the treatment of&#xD;
      qualifying migraine headaches (see below) as soon as possible and always within 60 minutes of&#xD;
      onset during a period of up to 4 weeks. Participants will be instructed to use the device&#xD;
      with the intensity level identified during the device training visit (and adjust as&#xD;
      necessary) and make sure the stimulation is perceptible but not painful. Participants will be&#xD;
      instructed to avoid taking rescue medications within 2 hours post-treatment. If medications&#xD;
      are used, participants will be instructed to record in the app when and which medication was&#xD;
      taken at 2- and 24-hours post treatment. The participants will use the app to record pain&#xD;
      intensity levels, the presence/absence of aura and associated migraine symptoms (nausea,&#xD;
      photophobia, phonophobia, and allodynia l) as well as rate their stress level and functional&#xD;
      disability at baseline, 2- and 24-hours post-treatment. At the beginning of each treatment,&#xD;
      participants will also be asked to report the time elapsed from attack onset. Adverse events&#xD;
      will be reported throughout this phase of the study directly to the site staff.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants who do not achieve satisfactory relief at 2 hours post-treatment may treat again&#xD;
      with the Nerivio™ device or may treat with usual care at that time or any time thereafter if&#xD;
      the headache does not resolve. Participants will also be able to treat headache recurrence&#xD;
      with the device. Migraine headaches that are not treated with the device may be treated with&#xD;
      usual care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first reported treatment will be considered a &quot;training&quot; treatment, aimed to verify that&#xD;
      the participants use the device properly, and will only be included in the safety analysis.&#xD;
      The efficacy evaluation will be performed on the first treatment of a qualifying attack (see&#xD;
      below) following the training treatment (hereby termed &quot;test treatment&quot;).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Second (final) visit - End of study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will return to the clinic following the end of the treatment phase, at which&#xD;
      time they will return the device. The participants will have the option of returning the&#xD;
      device by mail instead of an on-site visit.&#xD;
