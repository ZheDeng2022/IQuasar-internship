      Introduction&#xD;
&#xD;
      Optimising fitness prior to surgery, known as prehabilitation, has the potential to reduce&#xD;
      risk and improve post-operative outcomes by increasing functional capacity and physiological&#xD;
      reserve. Prehabilitation strategies include educating patients with lifestyle modifications&#xD;
      such as smoking cessation, nutrition, exercise and anxiety reduction. Deconditioning and&#xD;
      sarcopenia has been shown to predict a higher cost amongst patients undergoing major&#xD;
      abdominal surgery [1] and has been recently identified as an independent predictor of&#xD;
      hospital length of stay [2], hence optimising functionality may prevent morbidity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is a growing need to improve outcomes in vascular surgery, yet few examples of vascular&#xD;
      prehabilitation exist. The 2018 Get It Right First Time (GIRFT) report [3] states one of the&#xD;
      key recommendations is to improve the use of prehabilitation and to make it more consistent&#xD;
      via NHS England commissioning.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Multiple studies with varying prehabilitation strategies have been published in the last&#xD;
      decade [4]. Prehabilitation has been associated with encouraging results in major colorectal&#xD;
      and upper gastrointestinal cancer surgery [5],[6]. Data such as these have also led to the&#xD;
      development of prehabilitation services within NHS Trusts [7].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Supervised training programmes have shown to improve patient's anaerobic threshold and&#xD;
      fitness in patients having aortic aneurysm repairs [8],[9],[10]. A recent randomised&#xD;
      controlled trial has provided evidence to support supervised exercise training, by suggesting&#xD;
      improvements in postoperative outcome, length of stay, postoperative pain and&#xD;
      complications[11]. Historically there were concerns about exercising in this cohort of&#xD;
      patients, however recent studies has shown that aneurysm expansion does not occur with&#xD;
      exercise and exercise is safe [11],[12].&#xD;
&#xD;
      St. Thomas' Hospital is a tertiary referral centre performing between 200-250 aortic aneurysm&#xD;
      repair operations annually. We serve a large demographic from South East England and receive&#xD;
      referrals from across the whole of the UK, making the provision and appeal of a supervised&#xD;
      prehabilitation exercise programme difficult.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prehabilitation education provided is especially effective if delivered at the right time,&#xD;
      for example, the need for high risk surgery; the so called 'teachable moment' [13]. Despite&#xD;
      the recent surge in evidence surrounding the benefits of prehabilitation, it is not yet part&#xD;
      of established pathways. There has been some guidance as to how to practically achieve&#xD;
      prehabilitation into our clinical practice but there is still work to be done in terms of&#xD;
      integrating it into perioperative pathways [14].&#xD;
&#xD;
      A mentored prehabilitation programme that does not require supervised exercise is&#xD;
      generalisable and feasible, but yet to show improvements in patient outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Over the last 12 months we have been delivering a group based prehabilitation and exercise&#xD;
      workshop named 'Road to Recovery'. This is a physiotherapist and anaesthetist led&#xD;
      prehabilitation workshop, targeted to provide valuable education and advice to patients and&#xD;
      their families about their surgery, hospital stay and expectations for discharge, diet,&#xD;
      lifestyle and exercise before their aneurysm surgery. The advice emphasises the importance of&#xD;
      empowering patients to take control of their own health. The workshop is designed to educate&#xD;
      patients and allay their fears and anxieties around hospital admission and surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The physiotherapist then provides a detailed lecture on exercise and the relevance of&#xD;
      strength in the recovery period. An interactive, group-based demonstration of various safe&#xD;
      and approved practical exercises is then undertaken. Feedback from the patients has been&#xD;
      positive.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As part of the study, in addition to the prehabilitation workshop, we also aim to examine the&#xD;
      potential benefits of a mentored approach, by use of technology and communication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our patients often live long distances from the hospital, so frequent hospital visits and&#xD;
      supervised exercise sessions are not plausible. Therefore, a mentored prehabilitation&#xD;
      programme could be considered more practical and generalisable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We hypothesize that a prehabilitation workshop, and continued patient engagement, has the&#xD;
      potential benefit to improve both the physical and psychological wellbeing of patients&#xD;
      awaiting aortic aneurysm repair.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An initial pilot study examining the study design and deliverability of a mentored approach&#xD;
      prehabilitation programme, is warranted.&#xD;

      Our hypothesis is that a mentored prehabilitation programme will benefit patients having&#xD;
      elective aortic aneurysm surgery. This approach should be tested in a pilot study to ensure&#xD;
      appropriate study design, processes and uptake of the programme by patients.&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
             -  Ability to walk&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Willingness to wear the activity tracker for 8 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Willingness to return at 8 weeks for assessment of secondary outcomes&#xD;
&#xD;
           Exclusion criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Urgent or emergency aneurysm repair&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Patients who undergo emergency admission during the 8-week time frame, will be&#xD;
                removed from the ongoing trial, but their data will be used up to that point.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Contraindications to exercise&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Severe musculoskeletal disorders preventing exercise&#xD;
&#xD;
           Recruitment&#xD;
&#xD;
           Eligible patients will be identified either from tertiary referrals, or during the&#xD;
           weekly aneurysm multidisciplinary meeting by the aortic clinical nurse specialist (CNS).&#xD;
&#xD;
           The CNS will post the participant information leaflets to eligible participants 2-3&#xD;
           weeks before their first surgical consultation.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The research team will then recruit and consent the participants on the day of their&#xD;
           attendance to the surgical clinic.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The workshop will run on two Fridays a month. The participants will then be randomised&#xD;
           to one of three groups on this date. All recruited participants will be given the&#xD;
           activity monitor and instructed on its use for the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The participants recruited into the non-mentored (Arm 2) and mentored (Arm 3)&#xD;
           interventions will then attend the workshop on the next available day. Participants in&#xD;
           arm 3 will be given training on the use of the app.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Participants will be reimbursed for all study-related travel costs.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Randomisation&#xD;
&#xD;
           Recruited participants will be randomised into one of three intervention groups in a&#xD;
           1:1:1 allocation ratio. A block randomisation technique with computer-generated sequence&#xD;
           of random numbers will be produced using Sealed Envelope software&#xD;
           (www.sealedenvelope.com).&#xD;
&#xD;
           Study Arm 1 (Control):&#xD;
&#xD;
           - Current usual practice, no prehabilitation workshop.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Study Arm 2 (non-mentored prehabilitation):&#xD;
&#xD;
           - Prehabilitation workshop with no further patient contact.&#xD;
&#xD;
           - Participants to be given a prehab 'pack' which includes lifestyle advice.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Study Arm 3 (mentored prehabilitation):&#xD;
&#xD;
           - Prehabilitation workshop with regular 'mentoring' up to 8 weeks after the workshop,&#xD;
           prior to their surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Participants to be given a prehab 'pack' which includes lifestyle advice.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Weekly phone call by a member of the research team to remind and encourage the&#xD;
                participant to increase activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Participants will be given a smartphone with a 'Prehab Activity' app. This app is&#xD;
                designed and delivered by Medopad (London, UK). The app will include motivational&#xD;
                push notifications, embedded documents and video clips summarising the importance&#xD;
                of prehabilitation and demonstration of exercises.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  The participants in this group will receive training in how to use the app by the&#xD;
                research team.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Participants will have the opportunity to access expert advice from a designated&#xD;
                physiotherapist in normal working hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Medopad is a software company which provides health information and a learning platform&#xD;
           for patients. All data is anonymised and the clinicians will be able to view any&#xD;
           comments made by the participants (using their ID only) - this will be cleared once the&#xD;
           participant finishes the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Medopad will receive anonymised feedback from participants via the research team.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Activity Trackers All patients are to have their activity levels tracked by an Actiwatch&#xD;
           Spectrum (PHILIPS Healthcare, Eindhoven, Netherlands) activity tracker. This is a&#xD;
           lightweight, waterproof, wrist-worn device. All data will be stored on the trackers and&#xD;
           downloaded anonymously onto secure research computers for analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Outcome assessors will be blinded to the intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Follow up&#xD;
&#xD;
           Patients will be followed at two time points in the trial, prior to surgery after the&#xD;
           eight-week intervention period (Follow up 1) and six weeks post-operatively (Follow up&#xD;
           2).&#xD;
&#xD;
           Follow up 1: Eight weeks after recruitment, prior to surgery&#xD;
&#xD;
           - The participant will be requested to attend St Thomas' Hospital to complete a QoL&#xD;
           questionnaire and functional assessments.&#xD;
&#xD;
           - The outcome assessor will remain blinded to the group allocation of the participant.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Follow up 2: Six weeks postoperative Subjects will be contacted to complete a QoL&#xD;
           questionnaire. Electronic patient records and discharge letters will be used to collect&#xD;
           data on post-operative complications, 30-day mortality and length of hospital stay.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Data Recording All data will be recorded onto paper CRFs which will then be transferred&#xD;
           onto CASTOR database.&#xD;
