      This study aims to determine if an expiratory resistance device that delivers non-invasive&#xD;
      positive expiratory pressure (nPEP) will reduce or stop coughing, reduce airway resistance&#xD;
      and improve quality of life in patients with tracheobronchomalacia (TBM) who are not&#xD;
      candidates for tracheal stenting.&#xD;

      PROSPECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Twenty subjects with chronic cough and TBM diagnosed by bronchoscopy or computed tomography&#xD;
      (CT) scan will be recruited to enroll 12 participants. Comorbid conditions that can cause&#xD;
      chronic cough, such as asthma, COPD, and GERD, must be treated if present, for subjects to&#xD;
      qualify. At the pre-baseline visit (V0), after obtaining verbal informed consent, each&#xD;
      subject will complete validated cough questionnaires to quantify their cough severity and&#xD;
      cough-related QOL at baseline. The baseline visit (V1) will occur in-person approximately two&#xD;
      weeks later, after a run-in period to minimize observation bias related to the cough&#xD;
      questionnaires. Written consent will be performed at this visit. At V1, the cough&#xD;
      questionnaires will be repeated and subjects' airway resistance and reactance will be&#xD;
      measured with impulse oscillometry (IOS). A study physician will perform a physical exam and&#xD;
      determine eligibility. Eligible subjects will then be given the nPEP device by the study team&#xD;
      and instructed on its use. Approximately four to six weeks after device delivery, at the&#xD;
      follow-up visit (V3), cough questionnaires and IOS will be repeated and they will be asked&#xD;
      for feedback regarding device design and user experience. Subjects may then be entered into a&#xD;
      cohort for up to six additional months, during which there will be no study visits or&#xD;
      procedures, but subjects may be contacted by investigators for additional narrative feedback&#xD;
      on the device and its use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study subjects will be given an nPEP device to use for four to six weeks. During this time&#xD;
      participants will be asked to remain on their current medical regimen and not to make any&#xD;
      dose changes or add new drugs, unless indicated by their primary care provider. Impulse&#xD;
      oscillometry will be measured at V1 and 4-6 weeks later at V3 to assess effect of the nPEP&#xD;
      device on airway physiology. A lung CT scan will be performed at V2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RETROSPECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This device was tried on two individuals and it was initiative and was beneficial. Many&#xD;
      patients are not candidates for tracheobronchoplasty itself due to medical comorbidities,&#xD;
      prefer to avoid the associated risks, or are not candidates for the required tracheal&#xD;
      stenting due to trachea size or anatomy. These patients are left without a viable therapeutic&#xD;
      option for their severe cough.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) devices have been reported to stop or prevent&#xD;
      cough in TBM, presumably through pneumatic stenting the large airways to maintain their&#xD;
      patency during exhalation. CPAP devices, however, are not labeled for this indication and&#xD;
      their functional utility is very limited given size of the device, need for a power source,&#xD;
      and multiple steps to don the equipment that are not easily completed while actively and&#xD;
      uncontrollably coughing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The physicians aimed to provide positive airway pressure at a low cost and through readily&#xD;
      accessible means, in order to abort coughing paroxysms in patients who were not candidates&#xD;
      for tracheal stenting and did not have access to commercial CPAP devices. Patients at Duke&#xD;
      University Hospital referred to the Interventional Pulmonary service for evaluation of&#xD;
      severe, debilitating TBM-related cough and possible tracheal stenting, but who were not&#xD;
      candidates for tracheal stenting given their airway anatomy, were given positive end&#xD;
      expiratory pressure (PEEP) masks assembled using existing hospital supplies. Specifically, a&#xD;
      standard, adjustable (5-20 cm H2O) positive end expiratory pressure (PEEP) valve manufactured&#xD;
      for attachment to a manual resuscitation (commonly known as bag-valve-mask) device was&#xD;
      attached directly to a flexible face mask, also from a manual resuscitation device. Patients&#xD;
      were instructed by their physicians how to use the PEEP masks. The patients used the PEEP&#xD;
      mask immediately during their clinical encounter and were given a mask to take home. (The&#xD;
      device was created by fellow, Lindsay Boole.)&#xD;
&#xD;
      This was a limited intervention for a very small number of patients (two), specifically&#xD;
      identified as being referred to Duke Interventional Pulmonary service with severe cough&#xD;
      related to TBM, but with anatomy that ruled them out as candidates for tracheal stenting.&#xD;
      There were no formal data collected and no separate follow-up for the purpose of this project&#xD;
      (though patients had ongoing clinical follow-up per standard of care). The patients'&#xD;
      subjective improvement with the masks was submitted as a case report abstract and poster at&#xD;
      the American College of Chest Physician meeting in 2017.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Other physicians asked Dr. Boole about the mask and if it could be used for their patients.&#xD;
      Therefore, the investigators would like to request a retrospective review of all patients&#xD;
      that used the PEEP mask between January 1, 2009 and August 20, 2019 to be included in this&#xD;
      pilot study. Approximately 15 records will be reviewed.&#xD;
