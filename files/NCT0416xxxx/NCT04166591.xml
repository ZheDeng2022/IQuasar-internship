  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this research is to explore abilities to learn word meanings from overheard&#xD;
      conversations in children with ASD (and, as a control, typically developing children).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 1 (Experiment 1): Subaim 1a: Identify child characteristics associated with&#xD;
      learning from overhearing. In a prior study, the investigators found that 13 children with&#xD;
      ASD were able to learn the meanings of novel words that they heard used in a conversation&#xD;
      involving two adults. In the current study, the investigators aim to study a larger sample to&#xD;
      identify what child characteristics are associated with good learning in an overhearing&#xD;
      situation as compared to a situation in which the child is directly taught the new word.&#xD;
      Subaim 1b: Assess retention and generalization of words learned from overhearing. The&#xD;
      investigators will re-test children on their knowledge of the word meanings after a 10-minute&#xD;
      delay to see if they both retain the word meanings and can generalize the new words to new&#xD;
      situations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 2 (Experiment 2): Determine whether children with ASD can learn from addressed&#xD;
      and overheard teaching via videoconferencing. The investigators will use a similar procedure&#xD;
      to Study 1, except that both overheard and directed teaching will take place on video.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 3 (Experiment 3): Determine whether children with ASD can learn verbs and&#xD;
      pronouns by overhearing. Most prior work on learning from overheard speech has focused on&#xD;
      learning nouns that label objects. This experiment extends this work to study other kinds of&#xD;
      words.&#xD;
