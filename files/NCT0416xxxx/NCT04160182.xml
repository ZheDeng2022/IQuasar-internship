      The purpose of this project is to determine the feasibility and effectiveness of a 6-week,&#xD;
      internet-based, Energy Conservation and Activity Management intervention among women who&#xD;
      report cancer-related fatigue following breast cancer treatment.&#xD;

    <description>The intervention will be delivered online by an occupational therapist. The intervention consists of 6 weekly sessions; each session will be 45 minutes long. The focus of the intervention is to teach breast cancer survivors strategies to manage their fatigue.</description>

    <description>The intervention will last approximately 45 minutes, and will be provided once/week for 6 weeks. The intervention is delivered &quot;live&quot; using web-cameras (e.g., Microsoft Zoom).&#xD;
Registered and licensed occupational therapists will deliver the intervention. At beginning of the intervention, the participant and interventionist prioritize the 5 most critical fatigue-related problems that they would like to solve during the intervention. Each week, the interventionist will guide the participant through a workbook to provide knowledge and examples on how to apply the knowledge to everyday fatigue-related problems. The workbook contains: (a) information regarding fatigue in breast cancer survivors, (b) knowledge regarding fatigue management strategies, and (c) worksheets to develop skills to recognize and solve fatigue-related problems. Participants will retain the workbook after study completion.</description>
