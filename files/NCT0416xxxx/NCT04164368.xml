      In this phase II study, the investigators are aiming to explore lenalidomide combined with&#xD;
      R-CHOP (R2-CHOP) in newly diagnosed double-expressor Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma patients&#xD;
      (DLBCL)&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Double expressor lymphoma is a subtype of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma defined as having&#xD;
      increased expression of MYC and BCL-2 by immunohistochemistry. Patients with double-expressor&#xD;
      lymphomas have a poor prognosis when treated with standard chemoimmunotherapy and have&#xD;
      increased risk of progression and recurrence. The investigators conducted this study to&#xD;
      evaluate the efficacy of lenalidomide combined with R-CHOP (R2-CHOP) in newly diagnosed&#xD;
      double-expressor, untreated Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma patients (DLBCL). Lenalidomide is&#xD;
      the second-generation immunomodulatory drug, and its anti-tumor mechanism may involve&#xD;
      immunomodulatory, antiinflammatory, and antiangiogenic effects and suppression of tumor&#xD;
      necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) from peripheral blood mononuclear cells. In this phase II&#xD;
      study, the investigators are aiming to explore lenalidomide combined with R-CHOP (R2-CHOP) in&#xD;
      newly diagnosed double-expressor Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma patients (DLBCL), in order to&#xD;
      find a potential promising way to treat this kind of disease.&#xD;
