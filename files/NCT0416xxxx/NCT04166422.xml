  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cardiovascular diseases (CVD) are the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in developed&#xD;
      countries. The consequent healthcare costs in Europe alone are estimated at 196,000 million&#xD;
      euros annually, approximately 54% of the total investment in health, resulting in&#xD;
      productivity losses of 24% [1-3]. In recent years, the impact of CVD in non-Western countries&#xD;
      has been growing [4,5]; therefore, prevention is presented as a primordial tool to improve&#xD;
      quality of life and patient survival [6,7]. Cardiac rehabilitation (CR) is defined as a&#xD;
      multidisciplinary program of clinical application of preventive measures for risk reduction&#xD;
      and global and long-term care of the cardiac patient. In secondary prevention, it is shown to&#xD;
      reduce the morbimortality by almost 50% in patients with heart disease. However, the&#xD;
      participation of patients in cardiac rehabilitation remains low, especially among the&#xD;
      following groups: the elderly, women and patients with a low socioeconomic profile. According&#xD;
      to the latest Euroaspire V data, participation in CR programs in Spain is around 50%. The&#xD;
      Reureca registry reports that only 10% of patients with a CR indication attend the programs.&#xD;
      Therefore, new technologies within the health field, specifically within cardiac&#xD;
      rehabilitation programs through the use of virtual reality (VR) and video games, are shown as&#xD;
      promising aids with the aim of increasing adherence, satisfaction with programs and&#xD;
      participation rates, offering the ability to perform physical exercise [8-11]. Virtual&#xD;
      reality is a simulation of a real or imaginary environment created by a computer system,&#xD;
      which allows the user to feel immersed and to interact with objects in that environment&#xD;
      [12-14]. Thus, the basic elements that constitute a VR system are simulation, interaction and&#xD;
      immersion [15]. Moreover, the creation of more adaptable and accessible videogame platforms&#xD;
      has meant that the phenomenon of technological expansion can be understood not only as a form&#xD;
      of leisure but also as an important means of learning and skills training, especially in&#xD;
      people with motor, cognitive and sensory (neurological and non-neurological) deficits [16].&#xD;
      In contrast to traditional CR procedures, which can be repetitive, causing a loss of interest&#xD;
      on the part of patients, video games and VR systems offer the opportunity to participate in&#xD;
      enjoyable tasks with a therapeutic purpose through physical interaction with the game. The&#xD;
      design of exercise-based videogames (exergames) provides the possibility of practicing&#xD;
      physical skills in an entertaining way and of adjusting the game according to the abilities&#xD;
      of the subject and the level of intensity. In addition, it is known that the level of&#xD;
      enjoyment of an activity has been identified as one of the predictive factors of the&#xD;
      effectiveness of an exercise program, and for this reason, interactive technology based on&#xD;
      exercise is becoming the all-time most popular strategy for the implementation of physical&#xD;
      activity [17-23]. It is important to emphasize that VR allows the creation of environments&#xD;
      suitable for activities related to CR. The users of these systems can develop simulated tasks&#xD;
      and activities in a safe way, since the clinicians have the capacity to control the duration&#xD;
      and intensity of the exercise and, in this way, to control and supervise the delivery of&#xD;
      stimuli in the virtual environment [24]. Furthermore, knowledge of results regarding the&#xD;
      performance of the task in real time, gained through extrinsic feedback, as well as the&#xD;
      playful nature of the activities proposed through VR and videogame devices, generates a&#xD;
      competitiveness and challenge component that further increases the degree of patient&#xD;
      motivation. In this regard, Klasen et al. [25] point out that this increase in motivation is&#xD;
      related to the influence of videogames on activation of the mesolimbic dopaminergic pathways&#xD;
      and their repercussions on the reward system of the brain. All this promotes active&#xD;
      participation on the part of the patient and thus increases adherence to the rehabilitation&#xD;
      treatment. The aim of the present work is to carry out a RCT to provide information on the&#xD;
      application of VR and videogame systems within CR programs in patients with cardiac diseases.&#xD;
