  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Drug Related Problem (DRP) is defined as an event that may potentially affect the health&#xD;
      outcomes in the patients. DRPs can occur at all stages of the medication usage process&#xD;
      starting from prescribing (included medication error and inappropriate prescription) to&#xD;
      dispensing stage. Lack of follow-ups and reassessment of therapeutic outcomes may also&#xD;
      contribute to DRPs. Pharmaceutical care is a co-operative activity in concert with other&#xD;
      health care professionals and offered directly to the patient for improved quality use of&#xD;
      medicines. Pharmaceutical care identifies and resolves actual or potential DRPs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In our clinical practice, during the patient admission in internal medicine unit, a&#xD;
      medication reconciliation process was conducted according to a validated protocol. The first&#xD;
      step consists of getting the Best Possible Medication History (BPMH), defined as the most&#xD;
      comprehensive list of all medications taken by the patient. The second step consists of&#xD;
      comparing the BPMH with admission prescription made by the physician in charge. During&#xD;
      pharmacist interview, pharmacist discussed about medication adherence and knowledge. The&#xD;
      third step consists of characterizing, solving and documenting DRPs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the patient's hospitalization, the pharmacist participates at the medication&#xD;
      prescription revision. At the discharge of hospitalization, a pharmaceutical standardised&#xD;
      interview is carried out during which the pharmacist explains the modifications of treatments&#xD;
      to the patient. During this interview, the hospital pharmacist updates the latest treatment&#xD;
      changes. For patient with more than 65 years old and long-term affection (or patient with&#xD;
      more than 75 years old with or without long-term affection) and 5 medications, the hospital&#xD;
      pharmacist write a medication discharge report (MDR) to patient, community pharmacist and&#xD;
      general practitioner.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For each medication, the investigators collected its name, dosage, dosage forms and frequency&#xD;
      of administration. For each DRP, the investigators collected the type of DRP and the drug&#xD;
      classes (according to anatomical therapeutic chemical classification system).&#xD;
&#xD;
      For each MDR, the investigators collected number of medication, number and type of DRP&#xD;
      including inappropriate prescription.&#xD;
