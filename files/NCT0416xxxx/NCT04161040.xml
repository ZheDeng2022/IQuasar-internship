  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Physical inactivity is a key risk factor for noncommunicable illnesses such as cancer and&#xD;
      cardiovascular disease-the two leading causes of death in West Virginia. The World Health&#xD;
      Organization recommends muscle-strengthening activities 2 or more days per week and a minimum&#xD;
      of either 150 minutes of moderate-intensity activity or 75 minutes of vigorous-intensity&#xD;
      activity per week. Yet, only one in five adults in the United States meets these&#xD;
      recommendations. Even more alarming is that 33.2% of West Virginians report that they did not&#xD;
      engage in any physical activity in the past month. Incentive-based interventions increase&#xD;
      physical activity in the short term, but incentives for healthy behavior are generally&#xD;
      discontinued after some period of time, and relapse of unhealthy behavior is common. Thus,&#xD;
      there is a critical need to develop interventions that result in both immediate and lasting&#xD;
      engagement in activity. The overall objective and specific aim of the proposed project is to&#xD;
      evaluate a brief laboratory model of relapse into sedentary behavior following&#xD;
      incentive-based interventions that is based on Behavioral Momentum Theory. The central&#xD;
      hypothesis is that incentives will increase activity, but relapse will occur in the brief&#xD;
      model, like what occurs in extended clinical treatment. Development of a laboratory model of&#xD;
      relapse into sedentary behavior (the expected outcome of the proposed project) will inform&#xD;
      future translational research, eventually leading to clinical applications of large-scale&#xD;
      physical-activity interventions that result in significant and immediate behavior change and&#xD;
      that minimize relapse.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Physical inactivity is a key risk factor for noncommunicable illnesses such as cancer and&#xD;
      cardiovascular disease (CVD)-the two leading causes of death in West Virginia. Physical&#xD;
      inactivity is fundamentally a behavior problem, and there is a growing body of research&#xD;
      supporting the use of incentive-based interventions to increase physical activity. In such&#xD;
      interventions, participants earn incentives such as money, tokens or points, entries into&#xD;
      prize drawings, or fitness-related commodities (e.g., gym memberships) by meeting defined&#xD;
      goals (e.g., daily steps, energy expenditure, fitness classes).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A crucial feature of any successful intervention is sustained behavior-change following the&#xD;
      removal or decrease in supports. However, most evaluations of incentive-based interventions&#xD;
      are completed on a short-term scale (4 to 12 weeks) and often fail to provide data on&#xD;
      follow-up. The studies that follow participants after the discontinuation of incentives often&#xD;
      show relapse to sedentary behavior following intervention. Similar relapse is common&#xD;
      following incentive-based interventions for other health-related behavior. Laboratory models&#xD;
      of relapse prevention have informed treatment for these other forms of health-related&#xD;
      behavior, but they have yet to be extended to interventions addressing sedentary behavior.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators' long-term goal is to develop practical interventions that sustain&#xD;
      increases in physical activity and thereby decrease a significant risk factor for disease&#xD;
      (e.g., cancer, diabetes). The overall objective of the proposed project is to evaluate a&#xD;
      brief laboratory model of relapse that is based on basic behavioral research grounded in&#xD;
      Behavioral Momentum Theory. The central hypothesis is that incentives in the brief model will&#xD;
      produce the expected increases in physical activity relative to no-incentive controls, but&#xD;
      that these gains will be rapidly lost when the incentives are discontinued. This hypothesis&#xD;
      is based other laboratory-based models of relapse (e.g., illicit drug use and challenging&#xD;
      behavior), which mirrored outcomes of, and led to advances in clinical, treatment. The&#xD;
      rationale for this project is that a laboratory model of relapse of sedentary behavior will&#xD;
      inform future translational research and lead to large-scale clinical trials of incentives to&#xD;
      improve physical activity that result in large, immediate behavioral change and that minimize&#xD;
      subsequent relapse.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The central hypothesis is that incentives in the brief model will produce the expected&#xD;
      increases in physical activity relative to no-incentive controls, but that these gains will&#xD;
      be rapidly lost when the incentives are discontinued. These outcomes would suggest that the&#xD;
      brief model produces outcomes similar to those obtained in more extended clinical treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Approach The anticipated number of participants is 30 individuals (age 18-74). Participants&#xD;
      will attend a single 90-min laboratory appointment. The laboratory space will be equipped&#xD;
      with a treadmill, comfortable seating, and leisure activities. A licensed nurse will screen&#xD;
      participants to ensure they are healthy enough to engage in physical activity and will remain&#xD;
      present for the duration of participation to provide medical assistance in the unlikely event&#xD;
      that it is needed. Block randomization will be used to assign participants to one of three&#xD;
      groups (one experimental and two control groups). All groups will experience three phases of&#xD;
      the study. Opportunities for sedentary leisure and physical activities will be continuously&#xD;
      available throughout all phases. The first phase will mimic pre-intervention conditions;&#xD;
      there will be a variety of activities available. No incentives for engaging in physical&#xD;
      activity will be provided, although such activities will be available. For the Relapse&#xD;
      (experimental) Group, the second phase will mimic an incentive-based intervention in which&#xD;
      participants can earn monetary incentives for engaging in physical activity. Then, during the&#xD;
      third phase, the incentives will be discontinued the Fatigue Control group will experience&#xD;
      the same conditions for Phase 1 and 2, but they will continue to earn incentives during Phase&#xD;
      3. The No-Incentive Control group will not earn incentives during any phase to control for&#xD;
      the possibility that participants will engage in some physical activity in the absence of&#xD;
      incentives.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will wear a heart rate monitor throughout the study to provide real-time data on&#xD;
      activity level and trained research assistants will use software to score time-stamped&#xD;
      duration of engagement in available activities (e.g., walking, sitting). A one-way ANOVA will&#xD;
      be used to compare mean durations of physical activity across groups. A power analysis[23]&#xD;
      shows that including 30 participants (10 in each group) will provide sufficient power to&#xD;
      detect an effect size of 0.8 at an alpha of 0.05. Additionally, the investigators will use&#xD;
      the heart rate data for preliminary analyses of mediation and moderation effects.&#xD;
