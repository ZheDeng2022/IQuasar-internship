      With the aging of society, the incidence of elderly leukemia in China has been increasing&#xD;
      year by year. The elderly patients with Acute Leukemia have poor basal state, and there are&#xD;
      many important organ diseases such as heart, liver and kidney. The incidence of infection and&#xD;
      hemorrhage is high in elderly patients after chemotherapy. These characteristics make the&#xD;
      treatment of elderly leukemia difficult. So we propose a new treatment plan by using the&#xD;
      therapy that rhTPO may promote the leukemia cells into the division cycle.We use the&#xD;
      synergistic effect of G-CSF and rhTPO to promote leukemia cells into the division cycle,&#xD;
      thereby the cells can be killed by cytotoxic drugs. At the same time, G-CSF and rhTPO are&#xD;
      used to promote the growth of granulocytes and platelets, therefore the side effects of&#xD;
      treatment of elderly leukemia can be alleviated. We provide a safe and effective chemotherapy&#xD;
      for elderly leukemia patients, so that more elderly patients receive chemotherapy,which has&#xD;
      important practical significance.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In China，the incidence of leukemia is 2.76/100,000. Leukemia ranks first in the mortality&#xD;
      rate of malignant tumors in children and adults under 35 years old. With the aging of&#xD;
      society, the incidence of elderly leukemia in China has been increasing year by year. The&#xD;
      elderly patients with Acute Leukemia have poor basal state, and there are many important&#xD;
      organ diseases such as heart, liver and kidney. The incidence of infection and hemorrhage is&#xD;
      high in elderly patients after chemotherapy. These characteristics make the treatment of&#xD;
      elderly leukemia difficult.In 1995, Japanese scholar Yamada proposed the CAG protocol&#xD;
      (granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) combined with low-dose cytarabine (Ara-C) and&#xD;
      aclacinomycin (ACR)) for the treatment of Acute Myeloid leukemia in elderly patients.when a&#xD;
      better response rate was obtained, the side effects were significantly reduced. Although the&#xD;
      application of G-CSF in the CAG protocol reduces the incidence of granulocytopenic&#xD;
      co-infection in elderly patients, thrombocytopenia, another common side effect of&#xD;
      chemotherapy in elderly patients, still limits the efficacy and safety of treatment in&#xD;
      elderly patients. Recombinant human thrombopoietin (rhTPO) is approved for thrombocytopenia&#xD;
      after solid tumor chemotherapy, but there are few studies on Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML).So&#xD;
      we propose a new treatment plan by using the therapy that rhTPO may promote the leukemia&#xD;
      cells into the division cycle.We use the synergistic effect of G-CSF and rhTPO to promote&#xD;
      leukemia cells into the division cycle, thereby the cells can be killed by cytotoxic drugs.&#xD;
      At the same time, G-CSF and rhTPO are used to promote the growth of granulocytes and&#xD;
      platelets, therefore the side effects of treatment of elderly leukemia can be&#xD;
      alleviated.Recent studies have found that erythropoietin and G-CSF act on the cardiovascular&#xD;
      system.By mobilizing bone marrow stem cells to repair ischemic myocardium,they promote&#xD;
      cardiomyocyte regeneration and neovascularization in the ischemic area. In addition to&#xD;
      promoting platelet growth, rhTPO can also reduce the cardiotoxicity of anthracyclines in&#xD;
      elderly patients with CAG.We provide a safe and effective chemotherapy for elderly leukemia&#xD;
      patients, so that more elderly patients receive chemotherapy,which has important practical&#xD;
      significance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The cycle of this trial is 8 cycles.After all the treatments completing, the patients are&#xD;
      followed up to observe the bone marrow.In the first year,the patients will be reviewed every&#xD;
      3 months;In the second year ,They will be reviewed every 6 months, and two year later,they&#xD;
      will be reviewed every year, including morphological analysis of bone marrow.After the trial&#xD;
      is completed, the survival information of the patients will be followed up by telephone or&#xD;
      through the trial center every 3 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      About combined medication:1) During the whole test period, patients are not allowed to&#xD;
      receive other anti-tumor measures other than test drugs, including radiotherapy,&#xD;
      chemotherapy, targeted therapy, immunological preparation, hematopoietic stem cell&#xD;
      transplantation, etc.;2) The investigator can take appropriate supportive treatment after&#xD;
      evaluating the relationship between adverse events and trial medication. The start and&#xD;
      duration of supportive treatment are recorded in the original record. These treatments&#xD;
      include antiemetics, antidiarrheal, antipyretic, antiallergic, diabetes treatment, use of&#xD;
      antihypertensive drugs, use of analgesics, use of antibiotics, and other uses such as blood&#xD;
      products;3)The patients can be given symptomatic treatment when hematological toxicity is in&#xD;
      level 3 or after the investigator has judged the condition, and record in the combined&#xD;
      medication;4)The patients can be given symptomatic treatment when non-hematological toxicity&#xD;
      is in level 2 and record in the combined medication;5) Basic diseases should be given to&#xD;
      maintain treatment;6) All concomitant medications, generic names, medication purposes,&#xD;
      dosages, and medication time received by the patient should be fully recorded in the original&#xD;
      record;7) It is forbidden to use other clinical trial drugs during the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The use of TPO in new technologies may increase the incidence of thrombosis. In this trial,&#xD;
      rhTPO will be discontinued when platelets &gt; 50*109/L. Because of chemotherapy, bone marrow&#xD;
      suppression and thrombocytopenia are observed. At the same time, newly diagnosed leukemia&#xD;
      often combined with thrombocytopenia. No special medication will be needed to prevent&#xD;
      thrombosis, and platelet level should be closely observed. Other technologies, other risks&#xD;
      and response plans are the same as traditional treatment plans The cost of patient medication&#xD;
      in this trial is similar to that of traditional treatment . The chemotherapy drugs used are&#xD;
      all listed drugs&#xD;
