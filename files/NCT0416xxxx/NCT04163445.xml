  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate performance of two modern total knee arthroplasty&#xD;
      designs using patient reported outcomes and force exhibited during various activities of&#xD;
      daily living.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      48 patients with primary osteoarthritis of the knee who have been appropriately designated&#xD;
      for treatment with a total knee arthroplasty (TKA) will be randomly assigned to one of two&#xD;
      groups; one group (24 patients) will receive a Depuy Attune PCR knee implant, and one group&#xD;
      (24 patients) will receive a MicroPort Orthopedics Evolution Medial Pivot knee implant&#xD;
      utilizing standard and modern techniques. These two implants are designed to recreate the&#xD;
      kinematic motion of a native knee articulation using different biomechanical design&#xD;
      philosophies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients will be monitored post-operatively using subjective and objective measures.&#xD;
      Subjective patient reported outcomes will be analyzed using the Knee Injury and&#xD;
      Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS), recorded preoperatively, as well as at 6 weeks, and 3&#xD;
      months postoperatively. Objective outcomes will be measured by having the patients perform&#xD;
      four activities over force plates that will measure the amount of force a patient generates.&#xD;
      The four activities will be: walking, standing from a seated position in a chair, squatting&#xD;
      to a seated position, and walking up stairs. These objective measures will also be recorded&#xD;
      preoperatively, 6 weeks, and 3 months postoperatively. The patient reported outcomes and the&#xD;
      objective measures will then be compared between the two groups.&#xD;

    <masking_description>The patient will be randomized to one of 2 treatment arms using a random number generator. The care provider will not be blinded as he will be implanting the device and following the patients' progress in clinic postoperatively, including radiographs which will show the implants. He will be blinded, however, to the results of the KOOS score and the data derived from the force plate analysis. The research assistants performing those assessments will be blinded to which treatment arm the patient belongs to.</masking_description>
