      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      CD19 and CD20 are often found on certain cancer cells. Researchers think that a person s T&#xD;
      cells can be modified in a lab to kill cells that have CD19 and CD20 on the surface.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To see if it is safe to give anti-CD19 and anti-CD20 CAR T cells to people with a B cell&#xD;
      cancer or Hodgkin lymphoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      People ages 18 and older with a B cell cancer or Hodgkin lymphoma that has not been&#xD;
      controlled with standard therapies&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be screened under protocol 01C0129 with:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Medical history&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physical exam&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood and heart tests&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bone marrow biopsy: A needle is inserted into the participant s hip bone to remove a small&#xD;
      amount of marrow.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Scans&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have apheresis: Blood will be removed through a vein. The blood with&#xD;
      circulate through a machine that removes the T cells. The rest of the blood will be returned&#xD;
      to the participant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once a day for 3 days before they get the T cells, participants will receive chemotherapy&#xD;
      through a vein.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will receive the T cells through a vein. They will stay in the hospital for at&#xD;
      least 9 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants may have a lumbar puncture: A needle will remove fluid from the spinal cord.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants may have a tumor biopsy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will repeat the screening tests throughout the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have follow-up visits 2 weeks after infusion; monthly for 4 months; at 6,&#xD;
      9, and 12 months; every 6 months for 3 years; and then annually for 5 years. Participants&#xD;
      will then be contacted annually for 15 years.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Improved treatments for a variety of treatment-resistant malignancies including B-cell&#xD;
           lymphomas, and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and Hodgkin lymphoma are needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A particular need is development of new treatments for chemotherapy-refractory B-cell&#xD;
           malignancies.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  T cells can be genetically modified to express chimeric antigen receptors (CARs) that&#xD;
           specifically target malignancy-associated antigens.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Autologous T cells genetically modified to express CARs targeting the B-cell antigen&#xD;
           CD19 have caused complete remissions in patients with leukemia or lymphoma. These&#xD;
           results have established anti-CD19 CAR T cells as an important therapy for relapsed&#xD;
           lymphoma, but only about 40% of patients receiving anti-CD19 CAR T cells have durable&#xD;
           complete remissions.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Most B-cell malignancies express CD19 and CD20, but expression of CD19 and CD20 can be&#xD;
           lost or diminished.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The malignant cells of Hodgkin lymphoma, Hodgkin Reed-Sternberg cells, originate from B&#xD;
           cells, which is the rationale for treating Hodgkin lymphoma with T cells targeting CD19&#xD;
           and CD20.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  CD19 and CD20 are not expressed by normal cells except for B cells and some plasma&#xD;
           cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  We have constructed a novel gene therapy construct that encodes a fully-human anti-CD19&#xD;
           CAR with a CD28 domain and a fully-human anti-CD20 CAR with a 4-1BB domain.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  T cells expressing this CAR construct, called Hu1928-Hu20BB, can specifically recognize&#xD;
           CD19 and CD20-expressing target cells in vitro and eradicate CD19 or CD20-expressing&#xD;
           tumors in mice.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  One CAR expressed in this CAR construct, Hu19-CD828Z has been tested in humans before.&#xD;
           The other CAR in the total construct, Hu20-CD8BBZ, has not been tested in humans before.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Possible toxicities include cytokine-associated toxicities such as fever, hypotension,&#xD;
           and neurological toxicities. Elimination of normal B cells is probable, and unknown&#xD;
           toxicities are also possible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary&#xD;
&#xD;
      -Determine the safety and feasibility of administering T cells expressing a novel fully-human&#xD;
      anti- CD19 and anti-CD20 CAR construct to patients with advanced B-cell malignancies and&#xD;
      Hodgkin lymphoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exploratory&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluate serum cytokine levels and associations with anti-malignancy efficacy and&#xD;
           toxicity&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluate clinical predictors of anti-lymphoma responses and toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluate phenotype of infused CAR T cells and CAR T cells from the blood of patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients must have any B-cell lymphoma, or CLL/SLL, Gray-zone lymphoma, nodular&#xD;
           lymphocyte- predominance Hodgkin lymphoma, or classical Hodgkin lymphoma with any CD19&#xD;
           or CD20 expression on Reed-Sternberg cells. Lower grade lymphomas transformed to DLBCL&#xD;
           are potentially eligible as is primary mediastinal B-cell lymphoma and all other&#xD;
           subtypes of DLBCL. Burkitt and mantle cell lymphoma are potentially eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients must have malignancy that is measurable on a CT scan or by flow cytometry of&#xD;
           bone marrow or blood.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients must have a creatinine of 1.5 mg/dL or less and a normal cardiac ejection&#xD;
           fraction.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  An ECOG performance status of 0-1 is required.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  No active infections are allowed including hepatitis B or hepatitis C.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Absolute neutrophil count&gt;=1000/mL, platelet count&gt;=50,000/mL, hemoglobin&gt;=8g/dL&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Serum ALT and AST less or equal to 3 times the upper limit of the institutional normal&#xD;
           unless liver involvement by malignancy is demonstrated.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  At least 14 days must elapse between the time of any prior systemic treatment (including&#xD;
           corticosteroids) and protocol-required leukapheresis or CAR T-cell infusion. Thirty days&#xD;
           must elapse from therapy with antibodies targeting CD19 or CD20 and CAR T-cell infusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The patient s malignancy will need to be assessed for CD19 and C20 expression by flow&#xD;
           cytometry or immunohistochemistry performed at the NIH. If unstained, paraffin-embedded&#xD;
           bone marrow or lymphoma tissue sections are available from prior biopsies, these can be&#xD;
           used to determine CD19 and CD20 expression by immunohistochemistry; otherwise, patients&#xD;
           will need to come to the NIH for a biopsy to determine CD19 and CD20 expression. The&#xD;
           sample for CD19 and CD20 expression must come from a biopsy obtained after any CD19 or&#xD;
           CD20-targeted therapies such as monoclonal antibodies if such antibodies or CAR T-cell&#xD;
           therapies have been received by the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  For classical Hodgkin lymphoma only, a biopsy from any time from any institution that&#xD;
           shows any CD19 or CD20 expression on Reed-Sternberg cells is adequate for eligibility.&#xD;
           CD19 or CD20 expression on the Reed-Sternberg cells that is weak or only present on some&#xD;
           Reed-Sternberg cells by immunohistochemistry is compatible with protocol eligibility.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  For all lymphoma types except for classical Hodgkin lymphoma, either CD19 or CD20&#xD;
           expression must be uniform . Uniform CD19 or CD20 expression is defined as no obvious&#xD;
           lymphoma population lacking antigen expression can be present. Antigen expression can be&#xD;
           assessed by either immunohistochemistry or flow cytometry.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  This is a phase I dose-escalation trial&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients will undergo leukapheresis&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  T-cells obtained by leukapheresis will be genetically modified to express the&#xD;
           Hu1928-Hu20BB CAR construct.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients will receive a lymphocyte-depleting chemotherapy conditioning regimen with the&#xD;
           intent of enhancing the activity of the infused CAR-expressing T cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The chemotherapy conditioning regimen is cyclophosphamide 500 mg/m squared daily for 3&#xD;
           days and fludarabine 30 mg/m squared daily for 3 days. Fludarabine will be given on the&#xD;
           same days as the cyclophosphamide.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Two days after the chemotherapy ends, patients will receive an infusion of&#xD;
           anti-CAR-expressing T cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The initial dose level of this dose-escalation trial will be 0.66x106 CAR+ T cells/kg of&#xD;
           recipient bodyweight.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The cell dose administered will be escalated until a maximum tolerated dose is&#xD;
           determined.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Following the T-cell infusion, there is a mandatory 9-day inpatient hospitalization to&#xD;
           monitor for toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Outpatient follow-up is planned for 2 weeks, 16 days (neurologic checks), 21 days&#xD;
           (neurologic checks) and 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, and 12 months after the CAR T- cell infusion;&#xD;
           less frequent follow-up is required more than 1 year after infusion. Long-term&#xD;
           gene-therapy follow-up for a total of 15 years after infusion is required.&#xD;

          -  For classical Hodgkin lymphoma only, a biopsy from any time from any institution that&#xD;
             shows any CD19 or CD20 expression on Reed-Sternberg cells is adequate for eligibility.&#xD;
             CD19 or CD20 expression on the Reed-Sternberg cells that is weak or only present on&#xD;
             some Reed-Sternberg cells by immunohistochemistry is compatible with protocol&#xD;
             eligibility.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  For all lymphoma types except for classical Hodgkin lymphoma, either CD19 or CD20&#xD;
             expression must be uniform . Uniform CD19 or CD20 expression is defined as no obvious&#xD;
             lymphoma population lacking antigen expression is present. Antigen expression can be&#xD;
             assessed by either immunohistochemistry or flow cytometry.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Only when insufficient biopsy material is available to allow CD19 and CD20 expression&#xD;
             assessment at the NIH, CD19 and/or CD20 staining performed at another institution can&#xD;
             be used&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  DLBCL patients must have received at least two prior chemotherapy-containing regimens&#xD;
             at least one of which must have contained doxorubicin and a monoclonal antibody.&#xD;
             Follicular lymphoma patients must have received at least 2 prior regimens including at&#xD;

             other corticosteroid for 14 days before apheresis and CAR T-cell infusion. Patients&#xD;
             must also not take corticosteroids at doses higher than 5 mg/day of prednisone or&#xD;
             equivalent at any time after the CAR T cell infusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must be able to understand and be willing to sign a written informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have either been previously treated on protocols of genetically-modified&#xD;
             T cells on a clinical trial at the NCI or received T cells modified with the MSGV or&#xD;
             MSGV1 gamma-retroviral vectors at any institution are potentially eligible under these&#xD;
             conditions:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  At least 3 months have elapsed since the last genetically-modified T-cell therapy&#xD;
                  that the patient received, and there is no evidence of replication-competent&#xD;
                  retroviruses (evidence must be provided from prior protocol Principal&#xD;
                  Investigator), and persisting genetically-modified T cells are either not&#xD;
                  detectable in the patient s blood or detectable at levels less than or equal to&#xD;
                  0.2% of blood T cells as measured by flow cytometry using the Kip-1 antibody in&#xD;
                  the flow cytometry lab of the NCI Laboratory of Pathology (Maryalice&#xD;
                  Stetler-Stevenson s lab).&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients that require urgent therapy due to tumor mass effects or spinal cord&#xD;
             compression.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must not have received any anti-CD20 or anti-CD19 antibody products in the&#xD;
             past 30 days prior to CAR T-cell infusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any history of receiving PD-1 or PD-L1inhibitors&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients that have active hemolytic anemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  HIV-positive patients are excluded because HIV causes complicated immune deficiency&#xD;
             and study treatment can pose more risks for these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with second malignancies in addition to their B-cell malignancy are not&#xD;
             eligible if the second malignancy has required treatment (including maintenance&#xD;
             therapy) within the past 3 years or is not in complete remission. There are two&#xD;
             exceptions to this criterion: successfully treated non-metastatic basal cell or&#xD;
             squamous cell skin carcinoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Women of child-bearing potential who are pregnant or breastfeeding because of the&#xD;
             potentially dangerous effects of the preparative chemotherapy on the fetus or infant.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Pregnant women are excluded from this study because study therapy can cause fetal harm.&#xD;
        Because there is potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to&#xD;
        treatment of the mother with study therapy, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the&#xD;
        mother is treated with study drugs.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Active uncontrolled systemic infections (defined as infections causing fevers and&#xD;
             infections requiring intravenous antibiotics when intravenous antibiotics have been&#xD;
             administered for less than 72 hours), active coagulation disorders or other major&#xD;
             uncontrolled medical illnesses of the cardiovascular, respiratory, endocrine, renal,&#xD;
             gastrointestinal, genitourinary or immune system, history of myocardial infarction,&#xD;
             history of ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation, active cardiac&#xD;
             arrhythmias (active atrial fibrillation is not allowed, resolved atrial fibrillation&#xD;
             not requiring current treatment is allowed (anticoagulants count as current treatment)&#xD;
             ), active obstructive or restrictive pulmonary disease, active autoimmune diseases&#xD;
             such as rheumatoid arthritis.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Hospitalization within the 7 days prior to enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any form of primary immunodeficiency (such as Severe Combined Immunodeficiency&#xD;
             Disease).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prior allogeneic stem cell transplant&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Systemic lymphoma treatment of any type and corticosteroid steroid therapy of any dose&#xD;
             greater than 5 mg/day or more of prednisone or equivalent is not allowed within 14&#xD;
             days prior to the required leukapheresis, or the initiation of the conditioning&#xD;
             chemotherapy regimen. Corticosteroid creams, ointments, and eye drops are allowed.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of severe immediate hypersensitivity reaction to any of the agents used in&#xD;
             this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients on systemic anticoagulant therapy except aspirin.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Active central nervous system metastases or cerebrospinal fluid malignancy. Patients&#xD;
             with known brain metastases will be excluded from this clinical trial because of their&#xD;
             poor prognosis and because they often develop progressive neurologic dysfunction that&#xD;
             would confound the evaluation of neurologic and other adverse events.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any current neurologic disorders except migraine headaches.&#xD;
