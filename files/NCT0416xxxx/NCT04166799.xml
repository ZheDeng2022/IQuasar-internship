  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Breast cancer patients undergoing adjuvant radiotherapy commonly experience radiation-induced&#xD;
      skin reactions which adversely impact quality of life. Importantly, patients receiving chest&#xD;
      wall radiation or patients with large breasts are more likely to have worse skin reactions.&#xD;
      In the last decade, there have been no significant advances in preventing or treating&#xD;
      radiation-induced skin toxicities. In response to the lack of evidence, Sunnybrook&#xD;
      investigators previously conducted a pilot study (REB #294-2018) of Mepitel Film and&#xD;
      preliminary results showed improvements in high grade skin reactions. Mepitel Film has not&#xD;
      been widely adopted in North America as more evidence is needed. The validate the efficacy of&#xD;
      the film compared to the standard of care, a study testing the efficacy of the film is&#xD;
      proposed. In the study, 216 patients will be randomized (2:1) to receive either the film or&#xD;
      the institution's current skin treatments and all patients will have their skin assessed.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Breast cancer patients undergoing adjuvant radiotherapy commonly experience radiation-induced&#xD;
      skin toxicities which adversely impact patients' quality of life. These skin toxicities may&#xD;
      present in the form of acute reactions including erythema, pruritus or moist desquamation and&#xD;
      late toxicities in the form of hyperpigmentation or fibrosis. The development of severe skin&#xD;
      toxicities may result in treatment interruptions or increase the risk of reconstructive&#xD;
      complications. Importantly, patients receiving radiotherapy to the chest wall or patients&#xD;
      with larger breast size are more likely to have more severe skin reactions. In the last few&#xD;
      decades, there have been no significant advances in preventing or treating radiation-induced&#xD;
      skin toxicities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A phase III randomized trial was conducted by Herst et al. (n=78) in New Zealand which showed&#xD;
      that the prophylactic use of Mepitel Film prevented moist desquamation (26% vs. 0%, p &lt;&#xD;
      0.001) and reduced skin reaction severity by 92% (p &lt; 0.001) compared to skin treated only&#xD;
      with aqueous cream. Mepitel Film has not been adopted in routine practice in North America as&#xD;
      more convincing proof may be needed from international multi-centre trials to influence&#xD;
      changes in standard clinical practice guidelines. A phase II feasibility study has recently&#xD;
      been completed at Sunnybrook Odette Cancer Centre and the preliminary results have shown&#xD;
      reductions in severe skin reactions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mayo Clinic has also completed a phase II pilot study which, like the feasibility study&#xD;
      conducted at our centre, yielded promising results. The Alliance trial group in the US is&#xD;
      planning for a phase III multi-centre trial for post-mastectomy patients receiving&#xD;
      conventional radiation treatment. As the Alliance trial is only enrolling post-mastectomy&#xD;
      patients receiving conventional radiotherapy, our study will additionally investigate&#xD;
      outcomes for post-mastectomy patients receiving hypofractionated radiation treatment.&#xD;
      Additionally, the investigators will be enrolling patients with large breasts [bra size 36 in&#xD;
      and/or C cup or greater] as these patients are at known risk for developing increased acute&#xD;
      skin toxicities&#xD;
&#xD;
      A randomized controlled trial is a critical next step in establishing whether Mepitel Film&#xD;
      reduces acute and long-term skin toxicity in post-mastectomy and large breasted patients and&#xD;
      in order for it to become standard of care in breast radiotherapy. This study plans to enroll&#xD;
      216 patients in a 2:1 ratio (2 Mepitel Film: 1 institutional standard of care).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective is to compare the efficacy of Mepitel Film versus the institutional&#xD;
      standard of care in reducing the severity of radiation dermatitis in patients undergoing&#xD;
      whole breast or chest wall radiotherapy. Secondary objectives include an evaluation of&#xD;
      patient-reported and healthcare professional (HCP)-reported skin toxicities including moist&#xD;
      desquamation with the use of Meptiel Film.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Radiation oncologists will first introduce the study to their patients in their breast&#xD;
      clinic, showing a sample of the product and also pictures from the trial conducted in New&#xD;
      Zealand. Patients if interested may be provided a patient information sheet to review at&#xD;
      home. Then, patients will be approached by a CRA at their radiation planning appointment to&#xD;
      review all information and obtain informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For patients randomized to the Mepitel Film arm, patients will receive the film for the&#xD;
      entire duration of treatment. Radiation treatment will be delivered as prescribed by the&#xD;
      treating radiation oncologist irrespective of study arm and may include a variety of&#xD;
      techniques and beam modifiers.&#xD;
