  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      At the Psychiatric Hospital, there are limited mental health professionals to offer the&#xD;
      standard of care that is expected at a psychiatric institution. Psychotherapy is most&#xD;
      affected. However, there are mental health professionals in training and long waiting times&#xD;
      before clients are seen, which provides an opportunity for an intervention to be carried out.&#xD;
      The purpose of the study therefore, is to determine whether a group psychological&#xD;
      intervention can primarily reduce self-stigma among outpatients at the Psychiatric Hospital.&#xD;
      The intervention's effects on self-efficacy and quality of life will also be assessed.&#xD;

      Study population: outpatients in the Outpatient Department at The Psychiatric Hospital&#xD;
&#xD;
      Target population: clients with two-weekly appointments&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedures for recruitment and consent&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be chosen using available lists of persons who come to clinic on a&#xD;
      two-weekly basis on four(4) days of the week (every day except the day the Principal&#xD;
      Investigator is responsible for conducting clinic), for two consecutive weeks. Twenty-six&#xD;
      will be chosen each day (for eight (8) days) and randomized to intervention and&#xD;
      treatment-as-usual (Thirteen (13) persons to each group). Participants will be selected based&#xD;
      on the inclusion and exclusion criteria and consent will be obtained.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization will be carried out by Stata 14&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size&#xD;
&#xD;
      Using the means and standard deviations for the Internalized Stigma of Mental Illness&#xD;
      Inventory (ISMI) used in a randomized controlled trial and Stata 14 for sample size&#xD;
      calculation, the sample size recommended is eighty-four (84) with forty-two (42) per group.&#xD;
      This will give a power (for the study) of eighty per cent (80%).&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, the aim will be two-hundred and eight (208) clients based on the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Target population: two-hundred and fifty (250). Approximately twenty-five (25) patients&#xD;
           come to clinic daily, most of whom come on a two-weekly basis. Therefore, this will&#xD;
           allow eighty-three per cent (83%) of the population to be part of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Maximum number of persons in a group- thirteen (13)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Maximum number of groups that can be held before clinic begins- one (1)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Time for thesis&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Taking into account that persons may not be willing to participate and so aiming to&#xD;
           include as many persons as possible&#xD;
&#xD;
      Method&#xD;
&#xD;
      There will be six (6) sessions covering six (6) topics. One topic will be covered at each&#xD;
      session. Sessions will last sixty (60) to ninety (90) minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Administration of the ISMI, the General self-efficacy scale and World Health Organization&#xD;
      (WHO)5 Well Being Index and a questionnaire to the intervention and control groups before the&#xD;
      intervention and after the intervention. This will be done by a health professional not&#xD;
      related to the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Permission was obtained from producer of ISMI. WHO5 Well-Being Index is free to use and&#xD;
      General self-efficacy scale does not require permission, once referenced.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All three scales have been found to be valid and reliable.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A pilot study on 26 persons will be conducted to test the questionnaire and scales.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To ensure accurate completion of questionnaire and scales by each participant, each item&#xD;
           will be read and explained before participants asked to select answer. Questions on&#xD;
           clarification will be encouraged.Time will also be given after, for participants to read&#xD;
           through answers if needed. Additionally, when collecting questionnaires and scales, the&#xD;
           mental health professional will scan through to ensure all questions answered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Questionnaires and scales will be identified using participants' record numbers to facilitate&#xD;
      verification of information such as whether medications or health care provider changed&#xD;
      during the course of the intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analyses&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Summary statistics&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Regression analysis of endpoint score adjusting baseline score and looking at the&#xD;
           difference between the intervention and treatment-as-usual groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intention to treat analysis will be used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Software to be used: Stata 14 Missing entries will be included in the analysis Data&#xD;
      handling and record keeping&#xD;
&#xD;
      Questionnaires kept in secure room for at least five (5) years&#xD;
