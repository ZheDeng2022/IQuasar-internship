  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The first purpose of this study is to test the body's protective reaction (making antibodies)&#xD;
      to a licensed hepatitis B vaccine (Recombivax-HB) after it is injected either in the arm fat&#xD;
      or muscle. Hepatitis B virus is an important cause of liver disease in humans. More than 21%&#xD;
      of healthy adults over age 60 years demonstrate evidence of previous Hepatitis B infection&#xD;
      using a common blood test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The second purpose of this study is to learn more information about other reasons (such as&#xD;
      body fat content, gene types, etc.), why older people respond less well than younger people&#xD;
      to vaccines. The Investigators will also learn more about the ability of certain white blood&#xD;
      cells, called T cells, to respond to protein signals in the blood. T cells do not seem to&#xD;
      respond as well to these protein signals as individuals age. The Investigators will compare&#xD;
      results to a younger group of volunteers who have also been vaccinated with hepatitis B&#xD;
      vaccine.&#xD;
