  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study the investigators investigate the feasibility and therapeutic potential of free&#xD;
      autologous fat grafting combined to direct visual urethrotomy (DVIU) in the treatment of&#xD;
      urethral strictures.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this study the investigators wish to proof the concept of free fat grafting into urethral&#xD;
      stricture via urethroscope. The investigators will recruit twenty male patients suffering&#xD;
      from (endoscopy proven) benign stricture of spongy urethra. All recruited patients have&#xD;
      undergone at least one direct visual internal urethrotomy (DVIU) before recruitment.&#xD;
      IPSS-score and uroflowmetry are recorded upon recruitment. The IPSS-score is repeated one day&#xD;
      preoperatively. Urine sample is gathered for bacterial and cytological analysis. Prophylactic&#xD;
      single dose levofloxacin antibiotic is orally administered before operation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The operation is performed in the operation room by one urologist and one surgeon under&#xD;
      general anesthesia. First abdominal liposuction (roughly 20 ml) and fat graft preparation is&#xD;
      performed. The fat graft is processed into nano-fat using Tulip GEMS Single-Use NanoTransfer&#xD;
      Set. Then urethroscopy is performed, urethral stricture is visually graded (location, length,&#xD;
      lumen), photographed, DVIU performed and nano fat graft (0,1-0,5ml) injected to stricture&#xD;
      site beneath the mucosal layer at three locations. Urinary Foley ch 18 catheter is inserted.&#xD;
      Patients are discharged the next day. Urinary catheter is removed after 20 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients are contacted by phone 1 week after the operation. Post-operative symptoms are&#xD;
      recorded and the patients are requested to contact the researcher if needed. Patient records&#xD;
      are screened for pre- and postoperative symptoms, medication, long term illnesses and&#xD;
      possible postoperative contacts to the hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Three months later uroflowmetry, urethroscopy and IPSS-questionnaire are repeated. Stricture&#xD;
      site is photographed and visually graded. In case of symptomatic re-stricture, the DVIU and&#xD;
      fat grafting is repeated once. After 12 months uroflowmetry and IPSS-questionnaire are&#xD;
      repeated. In case of suspected re-stricture the urethroscopy is repeated. Follow-up time is&#xD;
      12 months from the last fat graft injection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Trial starts in fall 2019. The clinical studies have been completed and the data analysis and&#xD;
      writing of the manuscript will be finalized in 2022.&#xD;
