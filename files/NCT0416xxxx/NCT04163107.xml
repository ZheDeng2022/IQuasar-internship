  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Multiple myeloma (MM) is a neoplastic expansion of bone marrow plasma cells. Despite advances&#xD;
      in treatment in recent years, MM is still a fatal disease. MM is characterized by the ability&#xD;
      of malignant cells to produce large amounts of monoclonal immunoglobulin. The secretion of&#xD;
      these immunoglobulins can be detected as the &quot;M-protein&quot; in serum, and the measurement of the&#xD;
      M-component is used both for diagnosis and to evaluate treatment response and relapse. The&#xD;
      high load of secreted proteins in MM cells requires a efficient way to clear these proteins&#xD;
      from the cells and targeting protein degradation is an important therapeutic target in MM.&#xD;
      This is today done by inhibiting the proteasome, one of the two central ways cells can&#xD;
      degrade proteins, by drugs named proteasome inhibitors (including bortezomib, ixazomib and&#xD;
      carfilzomib). Patients become resistant to these drugs, and it is therefore likely that&#xD;
      myeloma cells also utilise another important system for protein degradation, called&#xD;
      autophagy. Pre-clinical studies have shown that the combination of the proteasome inhibitor&#xD;
      carfilzomib and the autophagy inhibitor hydroxychloroquine increases myeloma cell death and&#xD;
      that hydroxychloroquine is able to reverse MM cell resistance to carfilzomib. This is the&#xD;
      rationale for this study, where the investigators add the autophagy inhibitor&#xD;
      hydroxychloroquine to a standard regime of carfilzomib and dexamethasone, to determine a&#xD;
      maximum tolerated dose of this combination and to study tolerability.&#xD;
