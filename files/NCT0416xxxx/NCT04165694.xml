      The goal of this study is two part: 1) to add to the literature which is still somewhat&#xD;
      sparse with numbers of patients undergoing the Single Anastomosis Duodenal Ileal Bypass&#xD;
      (SADI) as a revision for laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) and 2) to have a treatment&#xD;
      option for our Kaiser Permanente patients who seek additional assistance after a LSG with&#xD;
      persistent morbid obesity and the comorbidities that come with it.&#xD;

      Patients will be recruited during 10/15/2019 through 12/31/2023 with the following inclusion&#xD;
      criteria: 1) body mass index (BMI) 35 - 39 kg/m2 with comorbid conditions; 2) BMI 40+ kg/m2&#xD;
      with no comorbidities; 3) having a previous LGS; 4) having lost less than 10% total weight&#xD;
      loss with this LSG; 5) being a Kaiser member at the time of surgery; and 6) being at least 18&#xD;
      years of age. Exclusion criteria will include: 1) BMI less than 35; 2) having a hiatal&#xD;
      hernia; 3) having severe Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease; 4) having a primary bariatric&#xD;
      procedure other than LSG; 5) having already had a revisional bariatric procedure; and 6)&#xD;
      being less than 18 years old.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Age range for participants will be 18 - 100 years old. We will recruit 50 patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Revisional procedures for weight regain are PART OF USUAL CARE at Kaiser Permanente Southern&#xD;
      California. However SADI is a type of revisional procedure that is still considered&#xD;
      experimental. This procedure has a single surgical anastomosis. It has a restrictive&#xD;
      component when reducing the greater curvature of the stomach, but specially a malabsorptive&#xD;
      component, as the common channel is also reduced. The objective of this surgical technique is&#xD;
      to lessen the intestinal loop where nutrients are absorbed. It was part of a more extreme&#xD;
      procedure, that is currently standard of care, called the Duodenal Switch (DS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The DS procedure which is PART OF USUAL CARE results in very successful massive weight loss&#xD;
      however, it also has severe complications especially vitamin deficiencies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The SADI procedure is thought to confer the same weight loss benefits of the DS but without&#xD;
      the severe complications. This has not been tested systematically.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These eligibility criteria will be verified by the bariatric surgeon who is doing the consult&#xD;
      for a revisional procedure AS PART OF USUAL CARE. This will entail the surgeon looking in the&#xD;
      electronic medical record before meeting with the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, this review of the medical record before surgical consult is PART OF USUAL CARE.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All data collection and study follow-up visits are PART OF USUAL CARE for bariatric patients&#xD;
      at Kaiser Permanente Southern California. THIS INCLUDES PATIENTS WHO RECEIVE REVISIONAL&#xD;
      SURGERY. The only part of the study that is not usual care is the surgical procedure itself.&#xD;
      The patients enrolled in the proposed study will receive the following visits AS PART OF&#xD;
      USUAL CARE:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Surgical consult 2 - 6 weeks before surgery at which point the patients will be offered&#xD;
           the SADI procedure and consent will be done by the surgeon doing the consult in person&#xD;
           in the surgeon's office in the Department of Surgery at the West Los Angeles Medical&#xD;
           Center.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Visit with bariatric physician 7 - 10 days before surgery to go over laboratory values&#xD;
           and to insure instructions for surgical preparation were followed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Visit with surgeon and bariatric physician 7 - 10 days after surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Visit with bariatric physician 4 - 6 weeks after surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Visit 6 months after surgery with surgeon, bariatric physician, and other te am members&#xD;
           as necessary (i.e. nutritionist or social worker).&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Visit 12 months after surgery with surgeon, bariatric physician, and other team members&#xD;
           as necessary (i.e. nutritionist or social worker).&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Annual phone calls at years 1, 2 and 3 after surgery with bariatric care manager to&#xD;
           monitor laboratory measures, weight loss, and complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All data to evaluate the effectiveness of SADI will be abstracted from the electronic medical&#xD;
      record, These measures are taken from the patients as PART OF US UAL CARE. There are no&#xD;
      specific measures added to usual care for the SADI procedure. We already have a protocol for&#xD;
      the DS procedure. These data will include weight, height, laboratory results, diagnoses,&#xD;
      utiliza tion of services, and pharmacy records. No questionnaires will be used in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For each patient, data will be abstracted for 12 months before surgery and up to 3 years&#xD;
      after surgery. No questionnaires will be administered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome for the study will be percent total weight loss at 3 years calculated as&#xD;
      (weight at surgery - weight at 3 years)/weight at surgery. Data will be analyzed using linear&#xD;
      regression to predict what factors at baseline such as disease burden, gender, age, race&#xD;
      ethnicity, and BMI predict percent total weight loss at 3 years.&#xD;

    <description>The purpose of the research is to study additional weight loss and resolution of comorbidities in patients who undergo revision of their sleeve gastrectomy to a Single Anastomosis Duodenal Ileal bypass (SADI). The sleeve gastrectomy which you have already undergone is now the most common bariatric procedure performed. This operation was part of a 2-stage operation known a Duodenal Switch (DS) which was a sleeve gastrectomy followed by a long bypass of the intestine that involved 2 connections. This operation has many complications such as vitamin deficiencies and potential malnutrition. The SADI procedure is a version of the DS that bypasses less of the intestine and one less connection of the small bowel.</description>
