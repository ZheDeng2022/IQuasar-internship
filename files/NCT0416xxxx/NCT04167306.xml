      The COMB study is a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled multicenter trial in Sweden on&#xD;
      the efficacy of varenicline and bupropion, in combination and alone, for treatment of alcohol&#xD;
      use disorder (AUD).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design overview: A 13-weeks (91 days) multicenter clinical trial with four parallel&#xD;
      groups. 95 subjects per treatment arm will be randomized into the study. 380 subjects with&#xD;
      AUD will be randomized in total.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Varenicline (Champix®) and bupropion (Zyban®, patent time expired) are approved and marketed&#xD;
      in Europe and US for smoking cessation in nicotine use disorder, and for treatment of major&#xD;
      depression (bupropion). There is clinical evidence of an additive effect of the drug&#xD;
      combination of varenicline and bupropion on smoking cessation. Varenicline has been shown in&#xD;
      two RCTs to reduce also alcohol intake in subjects with AUD. It is hypothesized that&#xD;
      bupropion will enhance the effect of varenicline and that the combined effect size will be&#xD;
      greater than that of approved therapies for AUD. As efficacy endpoint, the trial uses the&#xD;
      alcohol specific biomarker for alcohol intake, phosphatidylethanol in blood (B-PEth). Outcome&#xD;
      will also be measured by self-reported alcohol consumption, the standard effect measure in&#xD;
      AUD trials.This will be the first trial using the biomarker B-PEth as primary outcome&#xD;
      variable. The use of a specific objective marker is expected to increase chances for&#xD;
      detecting treatment effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Development phase: II Number of randomized subjects: 380 subjects with AUD. 95 subjects per&#xD;
      treatment arm will be randomized into the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Number of sites: Approximately 5 study sites in Sweden&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigational medicinal products, dosages and administration:&#xD;
&#xD;
      There will be two separate study kits for IMP 1 and IMP 2&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigational medicinal product 1 (IMP1): Varenicline 1 mg x 2 p.o. daily. The&#xD;
      pharmaceutical formulation will be encapsulated tablets for oral use. Varenicline will be&#xD;
      escalated from 0.5 to 2 mg daily during the first week.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigational medicinal product 2 (IMP 2): Bupropion SR 150 mg x 2 p.o. daily. The&#xD;
      pharmaceutical formulation will be encapsulated sustained release (SR) tablets for oral use.&#xD;
      Bupropion will be escalated from 150 to 300 mg daily during the first week.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IMP 1 and IMP 2 are distributed at 7 occasions: Day 0, Day 7, Day 21, Day 35, Day 49, Day 63&#xD;
      and Day 77. The doses and route of administration for varenicline and bupropion are those&#xD;
      approved and recommended as oral formulations for smoking cessation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The trial comprises 9 study visits over 91 days: Screening visit,Day 0, Day 7, Day 21, Day&#xD;
      35, Day 49, Day 63, Day 77 and Day 91. Randomization is carried out according to block&#xD;
      randomization and eligible subjects are randomized to one of the below described intervention&#xD;
      arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be performed in accordance with the study protocol, with the latest version of&#xD;
      the Declaration of Helsinki, in accordance with GCP principles (ICH-GCP E6-R2), and&#xD;
      applicable regulatory requirements in Sweden . The study is approved by competent authority&#xD;
      (the Swedish Medical Product Agency) and the Etics committee. The trial is monitored by an&#xD;
      independent monitor according to GCP principles.&#xD;
