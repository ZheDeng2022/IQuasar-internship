    <textblock>
      This is a Phase II, non-randomized, open-label study to evaluate temozolomide in combination&#xD;
      with olaparib in patients with MGMT promoter hypermethylated advanced colorectal cancer.&#xD;
      Patients will receive temozolomide orally daily on days 1-7 and olaparib twice daily&#xD;
      continuously. Cycles repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or&#xD;
      unacceptable toxicity. After completion of study treatments patients are followed up at 30&#xD;
      days, and for patients that come off treatment for reasons other than disease progression,&#xD;
      clinical assessments will continue every 6 weeks for the first year and every 12 weeks after&#xD;
      the first year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the efficacy of TMZ in combination with olaparib in subjects with MGMT&#xD;
      promoter hypermethylated advanced colorectal cancer by the overall response rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the safety of TMZ in combination with olaparib. II. To estimate the&#xD;
      progression free survival (PFS). III. To estimate overall survival (OS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Characterize NGS profiling, patterns of DNA methylation, gene expression, and develop MGMT&#xD;
      expression assays.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Correlate molecular features with Gamma H2AX with response. III. Establish organoids for&#xD;
      MGMT promoter hypermethylated colorectal cancer.&#xD;
