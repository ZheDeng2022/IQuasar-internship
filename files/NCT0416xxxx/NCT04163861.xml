      Background: Originally thought to be purely due to LV diastolic dysfunction, studies in&#xD;
      western countries have suggested that heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF)&#xD;
      is more complex. In patients with HFpEF, LV systolic function is commonly considered normal&#xD;
      as the global ejection fraction (EF) is normal. However, the EF reflects only the global&#xD;
      cardiac contractile function and does not take the subclinical systolic function into&#xD;
      consideration. Therefore more attention should be paid on this subset of heart failure&#xD;
      population in which the frequency and magnitude of concomitant subclinical systolic&#xD;
      dysfunction has not been clearly defined.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: The principal objective of this study was to assess the global longitudinal&#xD;
      systolic function of the LV in patients with HFpEF in a tertiary level hospital with the aim&#xD;
      of finding out the frequency and magnitude of impaired subclinical systolic dysfunction by&#xD;
      using Global Longitudinal Strain (GLS) derived from 2D speckle tracking echocardiography and&#xD;
      to see if there is any correlation of GLS with New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional&#xD;
      class and BNP level in these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: This was a cross-sectional study conducted from May 2018 to April 2019. A total of&#xD;
      31 patients with HFpEF (Group I) and 31 healthy volunteers of similar age and sex (Group II)&#xD;
      were enrolled in the study by consecutive sampling. Detailed history including NYHA&#xD;
      functional class, physical examination, relevant investigations including BNP level was done&#xD;
      in patients with HFpEF. 2D echocardiography, color Doppler, tissue Doppler and 2D speckle&#xD;
      tracking echocardiography was done in both groups. GLS was obtained in a total of 31 patients&#xD;
      with HFpEF (Group I), diagnosed according to the 2016 European Society of Cardiology (ESC)&#xD;
      guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of acute and chronic heart failure and compared&#xD;
      with GLS of 31 healthy volunteers (Group II), to find out the frequency and magnitude of&#xD;
      impaired subclinical systolic function in patients with HFpEF. GLS was also compared with&#xD;
      their NYHA functional class and BNP level to find out if any significant relationship is&#xD;
      present.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Result: All patients with HFpEF had preserved LV ejection fraction (LVEF&gt;50%) and evidence of&#xD;
      diastolic dysfunction. HFpEF patients demonstrated significantly lower GLS compared to&#xD;
      healthy controls (14.92 ± 3.16 versus 20.60 ± 1.84). The reduction in LV GLS was&#xD;
      statistically significant (p &lt;0.001). Majority of patients with HFpEF (74.2%) had reduced&#xD;
      GLS, when reduced GLS was defined as &gt; 2SD below the mean value for healthy volunteers,&#xD;
      indicating the presence of subclinical systolic dysfunction in majority of these patients.&#xD;
      Worse GLS was associated with higher BNP levels in patients with HFpEF when modeled&#xD;
      categorically as quartiles (p = 0.044) and also when modeled continuously (Pearson&#xD;
      correlation, r = 0.5, p = 0.004), there was negligible correlation between LV GLS and NYHA&#xD;
      symptom class when modeled continuously (Spearman's correlation, rs = 0.052, p = 0.789).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Conclusion: Strain imaging detects impaired systolic function despite preserved global EF in&#xD;
      patients with HFpEF. Subclinical systolic dysfunction was frequent in the majority of HFpEF&#xD;
      patients. Lower LV GLS is associated with higher BNP level. LV GLS was not associated with&#xD;
      NYHA functional class. Further large scale studies are recommended to confirm the findings of&#xD;
      this study.&#xD;

      Case: All patients presented with the diagnosis of heart failure with preserved ejection&#xD;
      fraction (HFpEF) to Department of Cardiology, BSMMU were initially approached and then&#xD;
      selected as case on the basis of inclusion and exclusion criteria. Heart failure diagnosis&#xD;
      was made according to the 2016 ESC Guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of acute and&#xD;
      chronic heart failure. All inclusion criteria were established within 24 hours of&#xD;
      presentation. The eligible patients were explained about the study, written informed consent&#xD;
      was taken and demographic data were recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Control group: Apparently normal healthy volunteers were initially approached. Medical&#xD;
      records were reviewed for prevalent cardiovascular disease (stroke, coronary artery disease,&#xD;
      heart failure, arrhythmia), cardiovascular risk factors (hypertension, diabetes mellitus,&#xD;
      hyperlipidemia, smoking, renal dysfunction), systemic disease (such as cancer, infections,&#xD;
      autoimmune disorders) or any pharmacotherapy Subjects were excluded if any of these were&#xD;
      identified. The eligible patients were explained about the study. Written informed consent&#xD;
      was taken and demographic data, Pulse, blood pressure and respiratory rate were recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical data, including detailed medical history, cardiovascular risk factors and associated&#xD;
      comorbidities of patients with HFpEF were noted. Relevant physical examination was done and&#xD;
      recorded in semi-structured designed data collection sheet. Complementary data were collected&#xD;
      including chest radiography, ECG, Echocardiography, and relevant laboratory tests. The&#xD;
      symptoms of patients were noted. Shortness of breath was graded according to NYHA functional&#xD;
      classification. Venous blood samples were collected in plastic vacuum tubes at room&#xD;
      temperature for analysis of BNP using chemilumunescent micro particle immunoassay (CMIA) on&#xD;
      the ARCHITECT iSystem, on day 1 of presentation in HFpEF cases. Other laboratory&#xD;
      investigations including hemoglobin, serum creatinine, HbA1c in diabetics were also done.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Echocardiography was performed by using Vivid E9 (GE Healthcare, Norway) using a 3.5 Mhz&#xD;
      transducer. ECG leads were connected before analysis. LV diameters were calculated by M-mode&#xD;
      and LVEF by Simpson&quot;s modified biplane method. The LV mass was estimated by using the area&#xD;
      length method and adjusted for body surface area. Echocardiographic LV hypertrophy was&#xD;
      defined as an LV mass index&gt; 115 g/m2 for men and &gt; 95 g/m2 for women. LV geometry was&#xD;
      classified based on relative wall thickness (RWT), defined as (2×diastolic posterior wall&#xD;
      thickness)/LV end-diastolic dimension and Left Ventricular Mass Index (LVMi) as recommended&#xD;
      by the American Society of Echocardiography (ASE): normal = RWT ≤ 0.42 and no LVH; eccentric&#xD;
      hypertrophy = RWT ≤ 0.42 and LVH; concentric remodeling = RWT &gt; 0.42 and no LVH; concentric&#xD;
      hypertrophy = RWT &gt; 0.42 and LVH. Right ventricular (RV) function was assessed by tricuspid&#xD;
      annular plane systolic excursion (TAPSE) and tricuspid lateral annular systolic velocity (S')&#xD;
      by pulsed tissue Doppler. Peak pulmonary arterial systolic pressure (PASP) was estimated as&#xD;
      the sum of peak RV-right atrial gradient from the tricuspid valve regurgitant jet and right&#xD;
      atrial pressure on the basis of size and collapsibility of inferior vena cava. Presence and&#xD;
      severity of valvular heart diseases were assessed by color Doppler imaging and image guided&#xD;
      pulsed and continuous Doppler studies according to 2014 AHA/ACC Guidelines for the Management&#xD;
      of Patients with Valvular Heart Disease. Patients with more than mild valvular heart diseases&#xD;
      were excluded.Diastolic function parameters were measured as follows: peak early diastolic&#xD;
      filling (E) and late diastolic filling (A) velocities, E/A ratio, E deceleration time, early&#xD;
      diastolic septal and lateral mitral annular velocity (e'), average E/E', peak TR jet&#xD;
      velocity, left atrial volume index. Left atrial volume index was calculated using biplane&#xD;
      area-length method from apical four and two chamber views at end-systole from the frame&#xD;
      preceding mitral valve opening and was indexed to body surface area. Diastolic dysfunction&#xD;
      was classified into three grades according to 2016 ASE/EACVI guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      LV longitudinal strains were analyzed by 2D speckle tracking echocardiography for both&#xD;
      controls and patients with HFpEF. Cardiac cycles were obtained during a breath hold in&#xD;
      end-expiration. Special care was taken to obtain correct view and checking for&#xD;
      foreshortening. Endocardial border was traced at end systole, with a frame rate of&#xD;
      50-80/second, from apical long axis, four chambers and two-chambers view. In case of poor&#xD;
      tracking, region of interest (ROI) was readjusted. The results of all three planes were&#xD;
      combined in a single bull&quot;s eye summary, along with a global longitudinal strain value (GLS)&#xD;
      for the LV which was automatically calculated by automated function imaging (AFI). All strain&#xD;
      analysis on HFpEF, and normal control subjects was be performed by a single investigator. Two&#xD;
      independent investigators analyzed the echocardiography recordings blinded to clinical data.&#xD;
      The intra-observer and inter-observer variability of GLS was assessed from 10 randomly&#xD;
      selected patients by intra-class correlation coefficient(R). The R value for intra-observer&#xD;
      variability was 0.983 and for inter-observer variability was 0.980. This showed good&#xD;
      reproducibility of GLS for both same and different operators.&#xD;
