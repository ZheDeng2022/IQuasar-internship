      This is a randomized, parallel, open label Phase II single-arm window trial to assess the&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, parallel, open label Phase II single-arm window trial to assess the&#xD;
      clinical and biological effects of 10-21 days of neoadjuvant abemaciclib in patients with&#xD;
      HPV-negative HNSCC who are planned for oncologic surgery, with pre-clinically informed&#xD;
      genetic and immune biomarker correlatives.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the window-of-opportunity clinical trial, patients planned for oncologic surgery are&#xD;
      briefly exposed to a novel cancer agent(s) in the window between diagnostic biopsy and&#xD;
      definitive surgery. Paired, pre- and post-surgical tumor specimens permit ex vivo analysis of&#xD;
      target modulation in both tumor and the tumor microenvironment - providing insight into&#xD;
      mechanism of action and paving the way for rigorous companion biomarker development. Clinical&#xD;
      activity is assessed by quantitative change in tumor size (∆T), which is correlated to&#xD;
      hypothesis-driven genomic and immune biomarkers of interest.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators hypothesize that abemaciclib will significantly reduce tumor burden as measured&#xD;
      by ∆T. Further, investigators will test the primary biomarker hypothesis that the clinical&#xD;
      activity of abemaciclib is associated with an increased proportion of tumors that are T-cell&#xD;
      inflamed. Investigators will evaluate tumor-intrinsic, tumor microenvironment (TME), and&#xD;
      microbiome biomarker hypotheses in specific genetic contexts, including tumors with specific&#xD;
      classes of tumor protein 53 (TP53) mutations, p16 loss, and/or CCND1 amplification.&#xD;

&#xD;
          9. Pregnant or nursing (lactating) women.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Patient who does not apply highly effective contraception during the study and through&#xD;

                  abemaciclib and for 4 weeks after the final dose of abemaciclib.&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Males who are sexually active with a woman of child-bearing potential should&#xD;
                  apply highly effective contraception during the study as defined below, in order&#xD;
                  not to father a child in this period.&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. Women of child-bearing potential (WOCBP), defined as all women physiologically&#xD;
                  capable of becoming pregnant, must use highly effective contraception during the&#xD;
                  study and through at least 3 weeks after the final dose of abemaciclib. Highly&#xD;
                  effective contraception is defined as:&#xD;
&#xD;
             i. Total abstinence: When this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of&#xD;
             the subject. [Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal,&#xD;
             postovulation methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception].&#xD;
&#xD;
        ii. Female sterilization: have had surgical bilateral oophorectomy (with or without&#xD;
        hysterectomy) or tubal ligation at least six weeks before taking study treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        iii. Male partner sterilization (with the appropriate post-vasectomy documentation of the&#xD;
        absence of sperm in the ejaculate). [For female study subjects, the vasectomized male&#xD;
        partner should be the sole partner for that patient.] iv. Use a combination of the&#xD;
        following (both 1+2):&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Placement of an intrauterine device (IUD) or intrauterine system (IUS) 2. Barrier&#xD;
        methods of contraception: Condom or Occlusive cap (diaphragm or cervical/vault caps) with&#xD;
        spermicidal foam/gel/film/cream/vaginal suppository.&#xD;
&#xD;
        v. Note: Hormonal contraception methods (e.g. oral, injected, and implanted) are not&#xD;
        allowed as abemaciclib may decrease the effectiveness of hormonal contraceptives.&#xD;
&#xD;
        vi. Note: Women are considered post-menopausal and not of child-bearing potential if they&#xD;
        have had 12 months of natural (spontaneous) amenorrhea with an appropriate clinical profile&#xD;
        (e.g. age appropriate, history of vasomotor symptoms) or have had surgical bilateral&#xD;
        oophorectomy (with or without hysterectomy) at least six weeks ago.&#xD;
&#xD;
        11. Prisoners or subjects who are compulsorily detained (involuntarily incarcerated) for&#xD;
        treatment of either a psychiatric or physical (e.g., infectious) illness.&#xD;
