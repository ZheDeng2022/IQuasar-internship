  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      One of the most important responsibilities for the social services is to investigate&#xD;
      suspected child abuse and to offer suitable intervention for the families. The lack of&#xD;
      published studies on the effect of such interventions is therefore noteworthy. Globally, few&#xD;
      controlled studies have been published and none of them have been conducted in Sweden. To&#xD;
      better guide the social services in the selection of interventions, the need for Swedish&#xD;
      studies with experimental design is therefore apparent. Previous experience in using&#xD;
      manualized interventions with families within the social services points to the importance of&#xD;
      regarding issues of implementation and dissemination. Interventions need to be developed and&#xD;
      adjusted to optimize the chance of engaging families that often live under strong social&#xD;
      pressure. The interventions also need to be designed to enable implementation and&#xD;
      sustainability in regular services.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safer Kids is a manualized intervention offered to caregivers under investigation for child&#xD;
      abuse. The intervention was developed by the City of Stockholm in cooperation with&#xD;
      practitioners within the social services. The content is based on the established parenting&#xD;
      program Comet, but has been adjusted to suit the target group. Safer Kids has already been&#xD;
      offered for a couple of years within the social services, but has not yet been evaluated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this project, a study of intervention effects will be conducted. Caregivers will be&#xD;
      randomized to either receive Intervention as usual (IAU), or IAU plus Safer Kids. Effects on&#xD;
      established risk-factors for child abuse, as well as the abused childrens' experiences, will&#xD;
      be measures. Information on additional reports to the social services on child abuse will be&#xD;
      collected, up to 30 month after the intervention.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
      International studies have shown prevalence rates of child abuse globally, with around 20&#xD;
      percent of all children being exposed to violent or abusive parenting (Stoltenborgh,&#xD;
      Bakermans Kranenburg, Ijzendoorn, &amp; Alink, 2013). A Swedish study showed that 15 percent of&#xD;
      children living in Sweden sometime had experienced physical violence from a parent or close&#xD;
      relative, from which half had been exposed several times (Annerb√§ck, Wingren, Svedin, &amp;&#xD;
      Gustafsson, 2010). Apart from the suffering caused by the abuse in itself, does the&#xD;
      experience of child abuse act as a risk-factor for future problems. It has for example been&#xD;
      shown that children who have experienced child abuse run a greater risk for developing&#xD;
      depression, anxiety disorders, eating disorders, conduct disorders and substance abuse&#xD;
      problems (Norman et al., 2012).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite the apparent need for effective interventions to prevent child abuse, few&#xD;
      well-designed studies of intervention effects have been published. In a recent meta-analysis&#xD;
      including all randomized trials of all types of interventions to prevent or treat child&#xD;
      abuse, only 23 studies were included (Euser, Alink, Stoltenborgh, Bakermans-Kranenburg, &amp; van&#xD;
      IJzendoorn, 2015). The results of that analysis was also a disappointment, since the overall&#xD;
      effect in terms of reducing or preventing child abuse was d=0.13, an effect that turned out&#xD;
      to be non- significant after taking publication bias into account. However, a moderation&#xD;
      analysis showed that interventions based on parent training (N=10) showed significantly&#xD;
      larger effects than other types of interventions. In support of that result, another&#xD;
      meta-analysis including studies of parent training interventions only, did show a significant&#xD;
      overall effect of 11 percent absolute reduction in risk of reabuse (Vlahovicova,&#xD;
      Melendez-Torres, Leijten, Knerr, &amp; Gardner, 2017). Thus, even if parent training&#xD;
      interventions show some promise, the small to non-existent intervention effects found in the&#xD;
      meta-analyses also point to the need of developing more effective interventions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The application of manualized interventions is rare within the social services in Sweden, but&#xD;
      there have been a few projects in recent years with the purpose of implementing interventions&#xD;
      that previously have been evaluated in foreign studies. One example is the iRisk-project&#xD;
      (Broberg et al., 2015). The main purpose of that project was to investigate the ability of&#xD;
      regular service providers to implement the interventions fith fidelity and sustainability.&#xD;
      The effects of the interventions were also measured, but only with pre-post design without a&#xD;
      matched control group. Both parents and the practitioners appreciated the interventions.&#xD;
      There were also positive effects on outcome measures between pre and post the interventions,&#xD;
      but since no matched control group was included, no safe conclusion of intervention effects&#xD;
      could be drawn. However, several challenges were also identified in terms of implementation&#xD;
      and sustainability. First, it was found that it was harder than expected to recruit and&#xD;
      engage caregivers in the interventions. Secondly, several of the included service units had&#xD;
      difficulties getting started with interventions and many reported that contacts were&#xD;
      terminated prematurely. A third conclusion was that several practitioners described&#xD;
      difficulties in sustaining the work with the more time consuming interventions at their&#xD;
      service unit. A final conclusion was that practitioners found it difficult to maintain&#xD;
      continuity in the longer interventions, due to logistic challenges for the practitioner and&#xD;
      the families.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In summary, most previously evaluated interventions demand considerable time and resources,&#xD;
      and there have consequently been reports of challenges in terms of implementation. In view of&#xD;
      the prevalence of child abuse, it is therefore apparent that many families that are&#xD;
      investigated within the services never will get access to such interventions. Furthermore, a&#xD;
      condition in several of the existing interventions is that the suspected caregiver&#xD;
      acknowledges the abusive act that has been committed, either in the investigation that&#xD;
      precedes the intervention, or as a part of the intervention itself. This may pose challenges&#xD;
      in terms of stigma and motivation to engage in the intervention. In light of these&#xD;
      challenges, it is important to develop interventions that a) readily can be implemented with&#xD;
      fidelity and sustainability in regular social service units, b) is less demanding and time&#xD;
      consuming - both to be able to serve a larger number of investigated families, but also to&#xD;
      prevent fatigue and premature termination in participating families, c) that minimize stigma&#xD;
      and therefore can engage reluctant caregivers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It was with some of the above challenges in mind that the City of Stockholm developed the&#xD;
      intervention Safer Kids (Tryggare barn in Swedish), which will be evaluated in the present&#xD;
      study. The intervention is based on the Comet program (Komet in Swedish), which is an&#xD;
      established parenting program based on social learning theory. Practitioners at several&#xD;
      social service units participated in the development and necessary adjustments for the target&#xD;
      group. The program was developed in 2013-2014 and has since been implemented within the&#xD;
      Social services and is well perceived by practitioners and caregivers, but there is no&#xD;
      published study of its effectiveness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE AND RESEARCH QUESTIONS:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this project is to evaluate the effects of Safer Kids, that is offered within&#xD;
      the social services to caregivers suspected for child abuse. Families who are reported to the&#xD;
      social services will be recruited and randomized to either receiving intervention as usual&#xD;
      (IAU) or IAU plus Safer Kids. The study will answer questions pertaining possible additional&#xD;
      effects of supplementing regular interventions with Safer kids.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The specific research questions will be:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. What is the additional effect of Safer kids on the occurence of/time to reabuse?&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. What is the additional effect of Safer kids on established risk-factors for child&#xD;
           abuse/reabuse?&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. What is the additional effect of Safer kids on the well-being of the abused child?&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. What is the additional effect of Safer kids on the quality of the relationship between&#xD;
           the caregivers and the child?&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. What is the additional effect of Safer kids on the frequency of caregivers who&#xD;
           prematurely terminates contact with the social services?&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. What is the additional effect of Safer kids on quality of life and economic outcomes?&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. How is practitioner and caregiver adherence to the Safer Kids manual related to&#xD;
           outcomes?&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. How are practitioners experiencing the feasibility of Safer Kids?&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHOD:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Families will be recruited through the social service units that take part in the research&#xD;
      project. Service units from all parts of Sweden are invited to the project. The following&#xD;
      inclusion criteria will be applied 1) at least one caregiver in the family is suspected to&#xD;
      have perpetrated an abusive act towards a child, 2) at least one child in the family is&#xD;
      between 3 and 12 years old and 3) there is a decision of a formal investigation of the&#xD;
      matter. The exclusion criterium is that families already involved in an ongoing intervention&#xD;
      within the social services at the time of the report of the suspected act will be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is a randomized controlled trial. Families who are recruited to the study from the&#xD;
      units who take part of the project will be randomized to either the intervention as usual at&#xD;
      the unit (IAU) or to IAU plus Safer Kids. In the later condition, practitioners trained in&#xD;
      Safer Kids will offer that intervention. The service units reports to the research team when&#xD;
      a caregiver has been recruited and an assistant conducts the randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participating caregivers will answer questionnaires before the intervention, after 4&#xD;
      months and after 7 months. If the child participates in meetings, the practitioners will also&#xD;
      conduct a brief interview with the child at the same time-points. Caregivers will also be&#xD;
      asked to answer a shorter follow-up survey after 18 and 30 months. After 4, 7, 18 and 30&#xD;
      months from the first assessment, the practitioners will also complete a report for the&#xD;
      research team, based on records the unit keeps for every family they have served.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safer Kids was developed in 2013-2014 by the City of Stockholm. It was a joint effort between&#xD;
      practitioners at a selected number of social service units, and researchers and developers&#xD;
      within the City of Stockholm. The content of the program was based on the Comet program,&#xD;
      which is a regular parent training program based on social learning theory. The Comet program&#xD;
      has shown medium to large effects on child conduct problems in previous randomized trials&#xD;
      (Kling, Forster, Sundell, &amp; Melin, 2010; Stattin, Enebrink, √ñzdemir, &amp; Giannotta, 2015). The&#xD;
      intervention is delivered individually to caregivers and offered immediately after the report&#xD;
      of suspected child abuse have reached the social services. Thus, the question of guilt for&#xD;
      the suspected acts is not addressed with the caregiver. Instead the program is presented as a&#xD;
      preventive effort offered to all caregivers reported to the social services, regardless of&#xD;
      whether an investigation is started and regardless of results. The advantage with this&#xD;
      procedure is that the practitioner can start the work with the caregivers at a moment when&#xD;
      motivation is higher, rather than at a later point after an investigation that may take time&#xD;
      and result in fatigue. The first step of Safer Kids is 1-3 sessions with motivational&#xD;
      interviewing. If the caregiver decides to continue after that phase, six individual sessions&#xD;
      with general parenting content follows (e.g., child directed play, communication skills,&#xD;
      praise, and anger management). The six parenting sessions are followed by 1-3 follow-up&#xD;
      sessions depending upon the need in the family. Besides the meeting with the caregiver, Safer&#xD;
      Kids also include two individual sessions with the child (without parents if possible).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size calculation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The effects of interventions on child abuse have generally been non-existent or small (Euser&#xD;
      et al., 2015; Vlahovicova et al., 2017). However, the effects on indirect variables (i.e.,&#xD;
      risk factors) have been in the medium range (Chen &amp; Chan, 2016; Lundahl, Nimer, &amp; Parsons,&#xD;
      2006). If an intervention should have a practical meaning, the effect sizes at least have to&#xD;
      be between small and medium according to Cohen's standards. It was therefore decided that the&#xD;
      sample size should be large enough to at least be able to detect effect sizes in that range.&#xD;
      A recruitment of at least 54 families result in a statistical power of 80% to detect effect&#xD;
      sizes of d &gt; .35 (Faul, Erdfelder, Buchner, &amp; Lang, 2009). This is however under optimal&#xD;
      circumstances with no drop-out and expected heterogenity in the outcome measures. The goal is&#xD;
      therefore set to 100 recruited families. It is expected that a rather large portion of&#xD;
      included families will drop put, considering the high pressure and burden this group of&#xD;
      families often experience, as well as the sensitive situation of being the subject of&#xD;
      interventions within the social services.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analyses:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To examine possible differences between participants before the interventions, chi-squared&#xD;
      tests will be used for categorical variables, and independent t-tests for normally or&#xD;
      Mann-Whitney U-test for non-normally distributed continuous variables. Generalized Linear&#xD;
      Mixed Modelling (GLMM) will be employed for analyses of most outcome, except for the analyses&#xD;
      of time to reabuse (part of research question 1) and time to premature termination (part of&#xD;
      research question 5). For those outcomes, survival analysis (Cox regression) will be used.&#xD;
