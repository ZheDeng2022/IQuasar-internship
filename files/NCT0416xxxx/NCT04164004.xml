  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized study evaluating the effect of routinely collecting a standardized&#xD;
      questionnaire of heart failure health status during heart failure clinic visits. Participants&#xD;
      will be randomized to early or delayed implementation of a validated health-related quality&#xD;
      of life survey (the Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire). Participants randomized to&#xD;
      early implementation will be given this 12-question survey at each heart failure clinic visit&#xD;
      at the beginning of the study; their heart failure clinician will have access to survey&#xD;
      results but will continue to manage participants based on standard treatment practice.&#xD;
      Patients randomized to delayed implementation will start receiving the survey at each clinic&#xD;
      visit one year later. By comparing the health status and treatment rates between early and&#xD;
      delayed implementation, this study will determine the impact of standardized health status&#xD;
      assessment on patient outcomes and clinician decision-making.&#xD;

    <description>The first KCCQ-12 score collected one year after randomization will be compared between the early implementation and delayed implementation arms. KCCQ-12 scores will be collected in the delayed implementation arm starting one year after randomization.This will be the primary effectiveness outcome. KCCQ-12 has 4 domains (Physical Limitation Score, Symptom Frequency Score, Quality of Life Score, Social Limitation Score) and one Summary Score. Scores are scaled 0-100, where 0 denotes the lowest reportable health status and 100 the highest.</description>
