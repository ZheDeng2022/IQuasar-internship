             Â° Patients with eczema, psoriasis, lichen simplex chronicus, or vitiligo with&#xD;
             dermatologic manifestations only (e.g., no psoriatic arthritis) may be eligible&#xD;
             provided that they meet the following conditions:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Rash must cover less than 10% of the body surface area (BSA)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Disease is well controlled at baseline and only requires low potency topical steroids&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  No acute exacerbations of underlying condition within the last 12 months (e.g., not&#xD;
             requiring psorlen and ultraviolet A (PUVA) radiation, methotrexate retinoids, biologic&#xD;
             agents, oral calcineurin inhibitors, high potency, or oral steroids)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Treatment with systemic immunosuppressive medication (including but not limited to&#xD;
             prednisone &gt;10mg/day, cyclophosphamide, azathioprine, methotrexate, thalidomide, and&#xD;
             TNF-x antagonists) within 2 weeks prior to RO7198457 administration. Patients who have&#xD;
             received acute, low-dose, systemic immunosuppressant medication (e.g., a one-time dose&#xD;
             of dexamethasone for nausea) may be enrolled in the study after discussion with and&#xD;
             approval by the PI and Co-PI. The use of inhaled corticosteroids (e.g., fluticasone&#xD;
             for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) is allowed. The use of oral&#xD;
             mineralocorticoids (e.g., flurocortisone for patients with orthostatic hypotension) is&#xD;
             allowed. Physiologic doses of corticosteroids for adrenal insufficiency are allowed.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects with allergies to IV contrast agents requiring pretreatment with&#xD;
             corticosteroids will be excluded. Corticosteroids are immunosuppressive and may&#xD;
             interfere with RO7198457 tolerability and efficacy. Given that there are serial&#xD;
             contrast agent-dependent follow-up imaging studies built into the study which will&#xD;
             overlap with vaccination, subjects who require pretreatment with corticosteroids prior&#xD;
             to IV contrast administration will be excluded&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, pneumonitis (including drug induced),&#xD;

             pneumonia, etc.), or evidence of active pneumonitis on screening chest CT scan.&#xD;
             History of radiation pneumonitis in the radiation field (fibrosis) is permitted&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Known primary immunodeficiencies, either cellular (e.g., DiGeorge syndrome, T-negative&#xD;
             severe combined immunodeficiency [SCID]) or combined T- and B-cell immunodeficiencies&#xD;
             (e.g., T- and B-negative SCID, Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome, ataxia telangiectasia, common&#xD;
             variable immunodeficiency)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prior allogeneic bone marrow transplantation or prior solid organ transplantation&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any other disease, metabolic dysfunction, physical examination finding, or clinical&#xD;
             laboratory finding giving reasonable suspicion of a disease or condition that would&#xD;
             contraindicate the use of an investigational drug&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Known clinically significant liver disease, including active viral, alcoholic, or&#xD;
             other hepatitis, cirrhosis, and inherited liver disease or current alcohol abuse&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Previous splenectomy&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Administration of a live, attenuated vaccine within 4 weeks before RO7198457&#xD;
             administration or anticipation that such a live attenuated vaccine will be required&#xD;
             during the study. Influenza vaccination should be given during influenza season only.&#xD;
             Patients must not receive live, attenuated influenza vaccine (e.g., FluMist) within 4&#xD;
             weeks prior to RO7198457 administration or at any time during the study, and for 90&#xD;
             days following the last study treatment&#xD;
