      Objectives: To assess the treatment efficacy and tolerability of pregabalin in patients with&#xD;
      idiopathic restless legs syndrome (RLS) in South Korea.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design: A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter clinical trial&#xD;
      Study period: total 14 weeks: 2 weeks for placebo run in period and 12 weeks treatment after&#xD;
      randomization (titration for 4 weeks and maintenance for 8 weeks).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects: a total number of 100 participants (randomly assigned 1:1 to pregabalin or&#xD;
      placebo). The sample number was calculated based on a superiority design, 1-sided, alpha 0.05&#xD;
      with power 80% and drop rate 10%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria: adults aged between 19-80 and diagnosed with idiopathic RLS with IRLS&#xD;
      score of 15 or more.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria: Secondary RLS; serum ferritin &lt; 10 μg/L or history of oral iron therapy&#xD;
      within 3 months or intravenous iron therapy within 1 year; severe comorbid medical or&#xD;
      psychiatric disorders; history of pregabalin or gabapentin treatment within 3 months; other&#xD;
      comorbid sleep disorders or shift workers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment schedule and dose&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Placebo responders, who showed a decrease of IRLS score of 40% or more, are excluded before&#xD;
      randomization. Subjects will randomly assigned to receive either pregabalin or placebo with a&#xD;
      1:1 allocation. A starting dose is 75 mg/day for 2 weeks (taken 1-2 hours before habitual&#xD;
      bedtime). At the visit of 2 weeks and 4 weeks, a dose can be titrated by 75-150 mg according&#xD;
      to the response and tolerability. A dose ranging 75-300 mg per day will be maintained for 8&#xD;
      weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary outcome: changes in IRLS score after 12-week treatment. Secondary outcomes: remission&#xD;
      rate (decrease in IRLS score of 50% or more), CGI (clinical global impression)-improvement,&#xD;
      changes in 10-cm visual analog scale (VAS), RLS-6, PSQI (pittsburgh sleep quality index), ISI&#xD;
      (insomnia severity index), Johns Hopkins RLS QoL after 12-week treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis: ANCOVA for changes in IRLS score with a baseline IRLS score as a&#xD;
      covariate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tolerability: Safety profiles and Liverpool Adverse Event Profile (LAEP) will be assessed.&#xD;

    <time_frame>Baseline (week 0) and post-treatment (week 12)</time_frame>
    <description>Changes in International restless legs scale (IRLS) score after 12-week treatment. IRLS is used to assess the severity of patient's RLS symptoms. A total score ranges from 0 to 40 and higher scores mean more severe symptoms. Therefore, greater differences in IRLS scores between baseline and post-treatment mean a better outcome.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline (week 0) and post-treatment (week 12)</time_frame>
    <description>A proportion of patients who showed a decrease in IRLS score of 50% or more after treatment. Higher scores mean a better outcome.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>CGI (clinical global impression)-improvement</measure>
    <time_frame>Post-treatment (week 12)</time_frame>
    <description>The amount of RLS symptom improvement measured by physicians. CGI-improvement is a 7-point scale and rated as 1 (Very much improved), 2 (Much improved), 3 (Minimally improved), 4 (No change), 5 (Minimally worse), 6 (Much worse), and 7 (Very much worse).</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline (week 0) and post-treatment (week 12)</time_frame>
    <description>Changes in PSQI scores after 12-week treatment. A total PSQI score ranges from 0 to 21, and higher scores indicate worse sleep quality.</description>
