  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This open-label, randomized study for evaluating the efficacy and safety of single agent&#xD;
      belantamab mafodotin when compared to pom/dex in participants with RRMM. Participants will be&#xD;
      randomized in a 2:1 ratio to receive either single agent belantamab mafodotin or pom/dex.&#xD;
      Belantamab mafodotin will be administered intravenously at 2.5 milligram (mg)/kilogram (kg)&#xD;
      on Day 1 (D1) of an every 3 weeks (Q3W) schedule. Pomalidomide will be administered orally at&#xD;
      the approved starting dose of 4 mg daily on Days 1 to 21 of each 28-day cycle, with&#xD;
      dexamethasone administered orally at a dose of 40 mg once weekly (Days 1, 8, 15, and 22).&#xD;
      Participants in both arms will be treated until disease progression, death, unacceptable&#xD;
      toxicity, withdrawal of consent, and lost to follow-up or end of study, whichever comes&#xD;
      first. Approximately up to 380 participants will be randomized (320 + 60 to fulfill regional&#xD;
      country requirements).&#xD;
