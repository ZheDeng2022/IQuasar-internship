      STUDY OBJECTIVE&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of this study is to demonstrate feasibility of repetitive Transcranial&#xD;
      Magnetic Stimulation (rTMS) treatment for depression at stimulation frequencies other than 10&#xD;
      Hz. The objectives for this study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. to determine if each subject's frequency response pattern shows one or more distinct&#xD;
           frequencies of stimulation that generated increased Spectral Correlation Coefficient;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. to determine if these frequency response patterns differ across subjects; and,&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To gather pilot data for an extramural funding application to investigate the efficacy&#xD;
           of rTMS treatment at individualized stimulation frequencies as an alternative to the&#xD;
           standard 10 Hz protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      INCLUSION/EXCLUSION CRITERIA&#xD;

           magnetic field and are acceptable for use with transcranial magnetic stimulation&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY PROCEDURES&#xD;
&#xD;
      SUBJECT SCREENING AND ENROLLMENT If a potential TMS patient is evaluated and meets TMS&#xD;
      treatment criteria, they will be approached by a study staff member who is not involved in&#xD;
      their clinical TMS evaluation to inquire if they would like to participate in the study. If&#xD;
      they confirm interest, the study details and their involvement will be discussed with them&#xD;
      and the consent form will be reviewed and explained to them. They will have an option to&#xD;
      complete the consent form or take it home and complete it when they decide to participate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A copy of the signed consent form will be provided to the study participant and the original&#xD;
      signed consent form will be maintained.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be asked to participate in the following procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Qualitative Encephalograph (QEEG) One QEEG will be performed in using ANT Neuro equipment.&#xD;
      Recordings will be performed while the subjects are resting in the eye-closed, maximally&#xD;
      alert state. Electrodes will be attached to the subjects' scalp using a 64, Ag-Cl electrode&#xD;
      nylon electrode cap. These types of electrodes are non-invasive, apply easily and quickly&#xD;
      with little or no discomfort to the subject, and are easily removed with minimal clean up.&#xD;
      During the recordings, subjects will sit in a comfortable chair while the electrodes are&#xD;
      applied. The recording will then be performed and the technicians will alert subjects if any&#xD;
      signs of drowsiness appear. A CPz-referential montage will be used with electrodes placed&#xD;
      according to the 10-20 system (Leuchter et al., 1992; Dunkin et al, 1995). Signals will be&#xD;
      digitally recorded (bandpass 0.3-70 Hz) and analyzed with the Brain Vision Analyzer 2.0&#xD;
      software and MatLab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Symptom Survey/Mood Assessments&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will administer the following assessments weekly:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Inventory of Depressive Symptomology (Self-report) (IDS-SR)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Profile of Moods (POMS)&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Subjects will be asked about their feelings, thoughts, activities, or emotional&#xD;
      well-being. Assessments will be done with study staff and completely individually through&#xD;
      self-assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Motor Threshold Determination Before the Spectral Correlation Coefficient is determined, the&#xD;
      appropriate intensity will be assigned and used for the Spectral Correlation Coefficient&#xD;
      determination and subsequent treatments. The TMS physician(co-investigator/PI) measures the&#xD;
      subject's motor threshold by administering several brief pulses. The motor threshold is the&#xD;
      minimum amount of power necessary to make the patient's thumb twitch, and varies from&#xD;
      individual to individual.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Spectral Correlation Coefficient Determination Prior to the first treatment and following&#xD;
      motor threshold determination, subjects will receive stimulation with 68 different&#xD;
      stimulation pulse trains of 40 pulses each at frequencies ranging between 3 and 20 Hz in&#xD;
      steps of 0.25 Hz, plus intermittent theta burst (iTBS) stimulation, in randomized order. In&#xD;
      between pulse trains, 26 s resting period will be recorded. This entire procedure is called&#xD;
      &quot;frequency interrogation&quot; and will take forty (40) minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To estimate the optimal individual stimulation frequency, we will compute the spectral&#xD;
      correlation coefficient (SCC), which is the the similarity of spectra at two different&#xD;
      electrode locations at sliding center frequencies from 3 to 20 Hz in steps of 0.5 Hz and with&#xD;
      a 4 Hz band width (+/- 2 Hz). This is computed as a Pearson bivariate correlation coefficient&#xD;
      (R) between the seed (F3, stimulation site) and target (posterior locations of the&#xD;
      fronto-parietal control network) for each electrode pairing for pre- and post- interrogation&#xD;
      resting state. The change in Spectral Correlation Coefficient will be determined by&#xD;
      subtracting the post-rTMS from the pre-rTMS SSC, separately for each electrode pair. Only&#xD;
      electrodes with an increased SCC will be considered for further analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We next calculate the Spectral Correlation Coefficient density, which is an indicator of a&#xD;
      focal increase (clustering) of high Spectral Correlation Coefficient connections to a small&#xD;
      topographic area. To calculate density, the Euclidian distance between the remaining target&#xD;
      electrodes will be computed and summed. A large cumulative distance indicates that increased&#xD;
      targets are widely spread, while a small distance indicates a more focal activation. The SCC&#xD;
      and the inversed cumulative target distance then will be z-transformed and combined, such&#xD;
      that a large value would indicate a strong increase in connectivity along with a dense&#xD;
      distribution of the respective target electrodes, while a small value would indicate a&#xD;
      moderate connectivity increase and more dispersed target locations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In previous work, we have shown that Spectral Correlation Coefficient is a reliable biomarker&#xD;
      for 10-Hz rTMS treatment outcome in depression (Corlier et al. 2019) and our preliminary data&#xD;
      also indicate that connectivity density post interrogation at 10 Hz is higher for subjects&#xD;
      who responded to full rTMS treatment course at 10 Hz.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the current study, we propose to select the frequency with the largest connectivity&#xD;
      density (strong and focal connectivity increase within the fronto-parietal control network)&#xD;
      in the range of 3 and 20 Hz as the optimal individual stimulation density.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TMS TREATMENT&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ten patients will be administered 10 and up to 30 acute rTMS treatments at their individual&#xD;
      stimulation frequency and up to 6 taper rTMS treatments administered over 2-3 weeks. Weekly&#xD;
      evaluations of clinical symptoms (IDS-SR) will be the primary outcome measure, in addition to&#xD;
      the assessment of general tolerability and safety issues.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the treatment, the stimulation coil is placed on the head so that it rests above the&#xD;
      front region of the subject's brain. Treatment is then commenced according to the assigned&#xD;
      settings. During the treatment, subjects will hear a series of clicking sounds and will feel&#xD;
      a tapping sensation under the treatment coil. Per treatment, a total of 3000 pulses will be&#xD;
      administered over 75 bursts with 40 pulses delivered per burst. Each treatment will last&#xD;
      between 35-50 minutes depending on the treatment parameters.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment will be administered using the Magstim Super Rapid2 Plus1 system, a research device&#xD;
      or FDA-approved MagVenture Clinical TMS system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ANALYSIS&#xD;
&#xD;
      Weekly evaluations of clinical symptoms (IDS-SR) will be the primary outcome measure, in&#xD;
      addition to the assessment of general tolerability and safety issues. The assessments will be&#xD;
      used to determine feasibility, tolerability, and safety of this treatment assignment method.&#xD;
