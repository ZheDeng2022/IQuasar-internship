  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a qualitative interview study that aims to understand treatment burden in individuals&#xD;
      who have experienced prostate or colorectal cancer treatment within the past five years. We&#xD;
      intend to use patient and caregiver experiences to co-design interventions to optimise cancer&#xD;
      aftercare.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment burden is the workload of healthcare for patients and the consequences of this&#xD;
      workload on patient function. Treatment burden has been associated with negative outcomes in&#xD;
      stroke, heart failure, diabetes, and renal failure. Cancer is increasingly becoming a chronic&#xD;
      condition, and involves a variety of self-management tasks for patients and their caregivers.&#xD;
      In this study investigators will investigate treatment burden in people after prostate and&#xD;
      colorectal cancer. Investigators will seek to understand patient and caregiver perceptions&#xD;
      about cancer aftercare, and ways that services could be redesigned and improved to reduce&#xD;
      treatment burden, and improve patient outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will undertake a qualitative interview study, recruiting patients from general practices&#xD;
      and oncology outpatient clinics who have completed potentially curative treatment for&#xD;
      prostate or colorectal cancer, or who are on active surveillance or hormonal therapies for&#xD;
      localised or locally advanced prostate cancer. We will purposively sample, to ensure that&#xD;
      participants with comorbidities, those from lower socioeconomic groups, and rural dwellers&#xD;
      are adequately represented. We will conduct interviews according to a schedule, informed by&#xD;
      conceptual models of burden of treatment, Schwarzer's Health Action Process Approach, and&#xD;
      Normalisation Process Theory.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interviews will be filmed and/or audio-recorded and transcribed. Framework and thematic&#xD;
      analysis will be used to analyse and synthesise the data. Participants will be given the&#xD;
      chance to comment on outputs and findings (triangulation).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators plan to use the results of this study, and excerpts from video interviews&#xD;
      during co-design events, and to create new interventions to optimise aftercare for patients&#xD;
      with prostate and colorectal cancer.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The number of individuals surviving for more than five years following a cancer diagnosis is&#xD;
      steadily rising. Cancer is often a long-term condition. Individuals living beyond a cancer&#xD;
      diagnosis are required to participate in a range of self-management activities, including&#xD;
      (and not limited to) managing symptoms and comorbidities, self-monitoring for recurrence,&#xD;
      adjusting to life beyond cancer/managing psychological sequelae, taking medications,&#xD;
      attending follow-up appointments, and addressing unhealthy behaviours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment burden is the workload of healthcare for patients, and the effect that this work&#xD;
      has on patient functioning and well-being. In the 1960s, Thomas Creer recognised that patient&#xD;
      participation in their own healthcare was important in achieving disease control in&#xD;
      paediatric asthma. Since then, &quot;self-management&quot; has been extensively researched and&#xD;
      conceptualised. In the 1980s, Corbin and Strauss characterised three strands of &quot;work&quot; for&#xD;
      people with chronic conditions: medical management, for example adhering to medication&#xD;
      regimens and attending appointments; behavioural management, such as adopting healthier&#xD;
      lifestyle practices; and the emotional management of adapting to a long-term condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Increasing patient participation in self-management has mostly been viewed as a positive&#xD;
      strategy through which to improve health outcomes, reduce medical paternalism, and delegate&#xD;
      some tasks away from over-burdened health and social care systems. Treatment burden is a&#xD;
      relatively recent concept which highlights the potentially deleterious effects of increasing&#xD;
      patient workload. Treatment burden is becoming increasingly relevant as more people survive&#xD;
      into old age, often with combinations of comorbidities (including cancer) for which there are&#xD;
      multiple available therapeutic agents and complex self-management regimens.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In diabetes, renal failure, heart failure, and stroke, there is increasing evidence that&#xD;
      increased treatment burden is associated with reduced quality of life, non-adherence to&#xD;
      therapeutic regimes, and wasted resources. Treatment burden is modified by patient capacity:&#xD;
      those with lower self-efficacy, low levels of social support, financial difficulties, and&#xD;
      competing personal workload can experience increased treatment burden. In cancer, certain&#xD;
      large and distinct demographic groups, particularly rural dwellers and the socially deprived,&#xD;
      have poorer survival after a cancer diagnosis. The mechanisms of these inequities have not&#xD;
      been adequately explained.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is feasible that treatment burden could modify interactions with health services,&#xD;
      engagement with survivorship activities, and ultimately, cancer outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment burden is a relatively recent concept which is under-explored in in cancer&#xD;
      survivors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objectives of this study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To investigate patient perceptions of treatment burden after prostate and colorectal&#xD;
           cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To determine sources of treatment burden in prostate and colorectal cancer survivors,&#xD;
           their interactions, and the perceived consequences of treatment burden.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To utilise key concepts from the interviews to build a video narrative, featuring video&#xD;
           excerpts from participants to ensure that their voices reach a wider audience, including&#xD;
           professionals. We will use these narratives to improve cancer services through&#xD;
           co-design.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Qualitative interview will be conducted with approximately 40 patients, with or without&#xD;
      linked caregivers. They will be transcribed verbatim, and analysed using Framework and&#xD;
      thematic analysis.&#xD;
