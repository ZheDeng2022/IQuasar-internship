  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To evaluate the efficacy and clinical satisfaction of topical oxygen therapy (LOT) in chronic&#xD;
      wounds (including patients and medical staff), and explore its possible mechanism.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A multi-center open randomized controlled study was conducted. A total of 240 subjects were&#xD;
      expected to be accepted. Patients receiving normative wound treatment received cyclic topical&#xD;
      oxygen therapy, not excluding the treatment of other diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After signing the informed consent, the patients were randomly divided into the treatment&#xD;
      group and the control group. The total treatment time was 12 weeks or the wound healed&#xD;
      completely. The enrollment examination included lower limb arteriovenous examination&#xD;
      (including B-mode ultrasound, ankle-brachial index), and other related necessary examinations&#xD;
      (such as biopsy excluding malignant tumors; blood routine, bacterial culture excluding wound&#xD;
      infection; vibration area detection excludes peripheral neuropathy). Relevant examinations&#xD;
      and records were made at each time point, including pre-admission and weekly follow-up days.&#xD;
      Wound area measurement, image data collection, wound analysis, secretion detection, patient&#xD;
      pain score and satisfaction survey, medical staff evaluation were required at each time&#xD;
      point. Every patient in the group and the follow-up day should be treated according to the&#xD;
      guidance of the doctor according to the type of wound, including wet wound treatment,&#xD;
      debridement, decompression, stress treatment and so on.&#xD;
