  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this prospective cohort study is to assess the quality of therapy in patients with&#xD;
      stable ischemic heart disease (IHD) who had never applied for specialized medical care for&#xD;
      the last 3 years and try to accord their treatment with current clinical guidelines.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the quality of therapy in patients having come for the&#xD;
      first time consultation to the specialized cardiology department of the scientific research&#xD;
      centre within the PROFILE registry and to try to correct therapy according to current&#xD;
      clinical guidelines paying particular attention to reaching target blood pressure (BP),&#xD;
      low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), glycosylated haemoglobin - HbA1c (in patients&#xD;
      with diabetes mellitus) levels, improving exercise tolerance and quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first visit (V0) is an inclusion in the study. During this visit, an attempt to correct&#xD;
      or start (if it had not been started before) antiplatelet, hypolipidemic, antihypertensive&#xD;
      and antianginal therapy will be made.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The second visit (V1) is planned for each patient three months after the first visit (V0).&#xD;
      During the second visit number of patients who reached target levels of BP, LDL-C, frequency&#xD;
      of angina attacks will be assessed. If necessary, correction of therapy will also be made.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The third visit (V2) is planned for each patient one year after the first visit (V0). During&#xD;
      the third visit reaching target BP, LDL-C levels, frequency of angina attacks will be&#xD;
      assessed. If necessary, therapy correction will be recommended.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The last visit - telephone contact with patients - is expected in 2 years after the first&#xD;
      visit. During that visit it is planned to assess life status, complications and current&#xD;
      medical treatment.&#xD;

    <description>The Adherence scale of the Russian National Society of evidence based pharmacotherapy modified for patients with coronary heart disease will be used to assess patients' adherence to treatment. The patients will be asked questions about taking prescribed medications as recommended by a doctor.&#xD;
The score system with the min value in the scale 0 and the max value 4 is used for the assessment of the results: 0 - adherent, 1-2 - partially adherent, 3 - partially non-adherent, 4 - non adherent.</description>

Later, percent of the drugs that each patient actually takes will be calculated (for example, three drugs are indicated and two are taken - (2/3)*100 = 66.6%).&#xD;
In the end, the mean adherence to therapy in the investigated group will be calculated.</description>
