&#xD;
          -  Signed informed consents, prior to any trial-related procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Females between the ages of 18 and 42 years. The participants must be at least 18&#xD;
             years (including the 18th birthday) when they sign the informed consent and no more&#xD;
             than 42 years (up to the day before the 43rd birthday) at the time of randomization&#xD;
             who desire pregnancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Body mass index (BMI) between 17.5 and 38.0 kg/m^2 (both inclusive) at screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Regular menstrual cycles of 24 to 35 days, presumed to be ovulatory.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Documented history of infertility for at least 12 months before randomization for&#xD;
             women ≤35 years or for at least 6 months for women ≥36 years. Women with documented&#xD;
             bilateral tubal occlusion or male factor infertility requiring the use of donor sperm&#xD;
             established as a cause of infertility are eligible at diagnosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Early follicular phase (cycle day 2-4) serum FSH level between 1 and 12 IU/L (results&#xD;
             obtained within 3 months prior to randomization).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Male partner with semen analysis that is at least adequate for intracytoplasmic sperm&#xD;
             injection (ICSI) at screening or within 6 months prior to the screening date. Partners&#xD;
             with severe male factors requiring invasive or surgical sperm retrieval may not be&#xD;
             used. Use of donor sperm is allowed.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  At least 1 cycle with no fertility medication immediately prior to screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Hysterosalpingography, hysteroscopy, or saline hysterosonogram documenting uterine&#xD;
             anatomy appropriate for ART at screening or within 12 months prior to screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Transvaginal ultrasound documenting presence and adequate visualization of both&#xD;
             ovaries, without evidence of clinically significant abnormality (e.g., endometrioma ≥3&#xD;
             cm, no dermoid cysts) and normal adnexa (e.g., no hydrosalpinx) at screening. Both&#xD;
             ovaries must be accessible for oocyte retrieval.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  More than two previous controlled ovarian stimulation cycles for in vitro&#xD;
             fertilization (IVF)/ICSI&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Known stage III-IV endometriosis (American Society for Reproductive Medicine, 2012).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Oocyte donor or embryo recipient; gestational or surrogate carrier.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Known history of recurrent miscarriage (defined as three consecutive losses after&#xD;
             ultrasound confirmation of pregnancy [excluding ectopic pregnancy] and before week 24&#xD;
             of pregnancy).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participant's male partner, with obvious leukospermia (&gt;2 million white blood&#xD;
             cells/mL) or signs of infection in semen sample within 6 months of the participant's&#xD;
             screening. If either of these conditions exists, the male should be treated with&#xD;
             antibiotics and retested prior to the participant's randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Active arterial or venous thromboembolism or severe thrombophlebitis, or a history of&#xD;
             these events.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any known endocrine (total testosterone, prolactin and TSH) or metabolic abnormalities&#xD;
             (pituitary, adrenal, pancreas, liver or kidney) with the exception of controlled&#xD;
             thyroid function disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Known tumors of the ovary, breast, uterus, adrenal gland, pituitary or hypothalamus&#xD;
             which would contraindicate the use of gonadotrophins.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any abnormal finding of clinical chemistry, hematology and vital signs at screening,&#xD;
             which is judged clinically significant by the investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnancy (negative urine pregnancy test must be documented at screening and prior to&#xD;
             the first investigational medicinal product [IMP] administration), or contraindication&#xD;
             to pregnancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Hypersensitivity to any active ingredient or excipients in the medicinal products used&#xD;
             in this trial.&#xD;
