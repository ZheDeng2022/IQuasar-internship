  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The human brain has a central role in regulating appetite and food intake. It integrates many&#xD;
      metabolic, hedonic and trait-related signals that affect eating behaviour and determine when&#xD;
      and how much we eat. The effects of non-nutritive sweeteners (NNS) that provide sweet taste&#xD;
      with no calories on appetite, food intake thus weight status remain a subject of debate. In&#xD;
      this study, the investigators aim to investigate whole brain response to the ingestion of&#xD;
      beverages sweetened with caloric sugars (glucose, maltodextrin) or NNS (stevia) as well as&#xD;
      neural substrates of attentional bias to food (pre-and post consumption) in healthy lean&#xD;
      participants.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Non-nutritive sweeteners (NNS) are zero or no calorie alternatives to caloric sugars and&#xD;
      their role in appetite and weight status remains inconclusive. NNS similarly as caloric&#xD;
      sweeteners activate the oral sweetness receptors and conscious perception of sweetness.&#xD;
      However caloric sugars and NNS differ in their metabolic fate after ingestion, so that&#xD;
      caloric sugars lead to raised blood glucose, insulin and satiety inducing gut-peptide levels&#xD;
      after meals, but NNS do not influence postprandial metabolism. A recently proposed model&#xD;
      suggests that metabolic signals may have indirect effects on food reward processing via&#xD;
      alterations in higher cognitive function such as attention (Higgs et al. 2017), the role of&#xD;
      sweetness in this model is yet to be examined.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the proposed study stevia-sweetened beverage will be used as the NNS, glucose-sweetened&#xD;
      beverage as the caloric sweetener, water as a non-sweet non-caloric control and maltodextrin&#xD;
      as a non-sweet caloric control. The study has two aims: first to investigate whole brain&#xD;
      responses following the oral consumption of caloric sugars versus NNS using and physiological&#xD;
      MRI, and second to examine the neural correlates of the attentional bias to food cues&#xD;
      following the consumption of caloric sugars- vs. NNS-sweetened beverages using task-based&#xD;
      functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study participants will be asked to come to the imaging facility on four separate&#xD;
      occasions, corresponding to the four study beverages, glucose, stevia, maltodextrin and&#xD;
      water. Before coming to an imaging session participants should consume a breakfast of their&#xD;
      preference at home (which will be repeated before each session) and then fast for 3-4 hours.&#xD;
      Upon arrival subjects will fill in their mood ratings, and the breakfast composition&#xD;
      questionnaire and will be ready to start. Firstly, neural responses will be measured (before&#xD;
      consumption of the study beverages) while subjects perform a food visual dot probe task (VPT)&#xD;
      previously validated to show differences in attentional bias to food between fasted and fed&#xD;
      states (Stamataki et al. 2019). Secondly, a physiological MRI measurement will be performed&#xD;
      (Little et al. 2013) which will last 40 minutes. Third, subjects will perform again the VPT&#xD;
      (after the consumption of the study beverage) whilst an fMRI measurement will be performed.&#xD;
