      The Genital Nerve Stimulation - GNS - consists of a two-step procedure with a preoperative&#xD;
      non-surgical test-phase and a final surgical implantation of the neuroprothesis. In contrast&#xD;
      to the classical technique of transcutaneous lead electrode implantation for sacral or&#xD;
      pudendal nerve stimulation, the GNS-test-phase does not require any interventional procedure:&#xD;
      because the genital nerves are located just few millimeter below the skin, test-stimulation&#xD;
      can be achieved using skin surface or needle electrodes. Stimulation is achieved using a&#xD;
      battery powered hand-held stimulator . The effect of the stimulation can be tested by the&#xD;
      patient in their daily, home and professional environment, or at the practice under&#xD;
      urodynamic testing, or if required other electrophysio-logical testing. After confirmation of&#xD;
      the effectiveness of GNS, implantation of a permanent neuroprothesis can be planned. The&#xD;
      procedure is performed either under general or spinal anesthesia or using only local&#xD;
      anesthesia with IV-sedation as in the classical tension-free vaginal tape procedure (TVT).&#xD;
      Because the GNS does not require two surgical procedures for both the test- and the&#xD;
      final-implantation but rather only one for the final implantation, the presented protocol&#xD;
      allows considerable cost reduction in comparison to the usual procedures for sacral or&#xD;
      pudendal nerve stimulation.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Pelvic organ dysfunctions are complex and difficult to treat. These conditions affect a&#xD;
      substantial portion of the population, especially with increasing age. The two most frequent&#xD;
      pelvic dysfunctions are the idio-pathic overactive bladder (IOAB) and erectile dysfunction&#xD;
      (ED).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In pelvic dysfunctions, sacral nerve stimulation was the first technique for pelvic nerves&#xD;
      stimulation that typically involves electrical stimulation of the nerve via a dorsal&#xD;
      transformational technique of implantation. SNS evolved as a widely used treatment for OAB&#xD;
      but does not completely resolve symptoms in the majority of patients. Because PNS reach more&#xD;
      &quot;sphincter-vesico-anal&quot; fibers than SNM, PNS has been proposed for patients who have failed&#xD;
      to respond to sacral neuromodulation. The good effects of PNS in neurogenic and in some&#xD;
      non-neurogenic disorders. However, the implantation of a lead to the PN is not easily&#xD;
      accomplished and the risk for lead migration with implantation below the pelvic floor is&#xD;
      increased. So there is definitively a need for a more suitable alternative for selective&#xD;
      stimulation within the pelvic cavity, a method that cannot only be reserved for experts in&#xD;
      this field but for all gynecologists dealing with patients suffering from functional&#xD;
      disorders of the bladder in daily clinical practice. The stimulation of the dorsal nerve of&#xD;
      the pe-nis/clitoris - GNS - emerges as a very attractive alternative that might result in&#xD;
      great outcomes for controlling urinary and fecal disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Because part of the DNP lies superficially to the skin outside the pelvis, this nerve can be&#xD;
      stimulated using surface electrodes attached to the overlying skin of the penis or close to&#xD;
      the clitoris. This application is however limited, due to intolerance to required high&#xD;
      stimulation amplitude. Surface electrodes have limitations such as difficulties in proper&#xD;
      daily placement and issues related to hygiene as well as a lack of acceptance in some&#xD;
      patients. Implanted electrodes are more suitable. However, implanted electrodes in the penis&#xD;
      or near the clitoris, must endure the mechanical stress of penile erections and external&#xD;
      pressure, carrying the risk of the cable/electrode breaking or being dislocated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The GNS consists of a two-step procedure with a preoperative non-surgical test-phase and a&#xD;
      final surgical implantation of the neuroprothesis. In contrast to the classical technique of&#xD;
      transcutaneous lead electrode implantation for sacral or pudendal nerve stimulation, the&#xD;
      GNS-test-phase does not require any interventional procedure: because the genital nerves are&#xD;
      located just few millimeter below the skin, test-stimulation can be achieved using skin&#xD;
      surface or needle electrodes. Stimulation is achieved using a battery powered hand-held&#xD;
      stimulator . The effect of the stimulation can be tested by the patient in their daily, home&#xD;
      and professional environment, or at the practice under urodynamic testing, or if required&#xD;
      other electro-physiological testing. After confirmation of the effectiveness of GNS,&#xD;
      implantation of a permanent neuroprothesis can be planned. The procedure is performed either&#xD;
      under general or spinal anesthesia or using only local anesthesia with IV-sedation as in the&#xD;
      classical tension-free vaginal tape procedure (TVT). Because the GNS does not require two&#xD;
      surgical procedures for both the test- and the final-implantation but rather only one for the&#xD;
      final implantation, the presented protocol allows considerable cost reduction in comparison&#xD;
      to the usual procedures for sacral or pudendal nerve stimulation.&#xD;
