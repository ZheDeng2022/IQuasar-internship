  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with neuromuscular diseases (NMD) can suffer from a range of respiratory problems&#xD;
      due to respiratory muscle weakness. Cough muscle weakness means secretion clearance from the&#xD;
      airways can be problematic, a source of infection, and importantly a cause of death, in this&#xD;
      patient group. Therefore, these patients are often supported with devices to aid clearance,&#xD;
      such as mechanical insufflation-exsufflation (MIE). Although evidence supports the use of&#xD;
      these devices, the optimal technique or settings on the device are not clear. Increasingly,&#xD;
      higher pressures are used during MIE and recent work has demonstrated that there may be a&#xD;
      physiological benefit to this. However, higher pressures increase the risk of causing lung&#xD;
      collapse and may cause detriment to blood flow back to the heart, which is important as NMD&#xD;
      patients frequently have concurrent heart muscle weakness. Further, recent work has&#xD;
      demonstrated that higher pressures can cause closure of the throat, which is&#xD;
      counter-productive in secretion clearance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The overall aim of this study is to investigate methods to manipulate MIE to improve&#xD;
      secretion clearance in patients with NMD. The questions it seeks to answer are:&#xD;
&#xD;
      (i) how can we maximally improve lung recruitment during inspiration, whilst maintaining&#xD;
      patient comfort and lower pressures (ii) what is the smallest pressure difference required in&#xD;
      expiration to achieve an improvement in cough (iii) do these proposed changes to MIE also&#xD;
      cause throat closure (iv) what factors do patients believe contribute to their adherence to&#xD;
      MIE therapy?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with slowly progressive or stable neuromuscular diseases will be included in the&#xD;
      study. Participation will involve two visits to the Lane Fox Respiratory Unit, each lasting&#xD;
      approximately four hours. Patients will be recruited from specialist neuromuscular&#xD;
      respiratory clinics by their clinical teams.&#xD;
