      The objective is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of modified XELOXIRI combined with&#xD;
      molecular targeted drug as first-line therapy in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer&#xD;
      (mCRC)&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      It is an investigator-initiated, single institution, prospective, single-arm clinical study&#xD;
      to evaluate the efficacy and safety of modified XELOXIRI combined with molecular targeted&#xD;
      drug as first-line therapy in patients with unresectable mCRC. Eligible patients will receive&#xD;
      8 cycles of mXELOXIRI with cetuximab or bevacizumab and then the maintenance therapy until&#xD;
      disease progression (PD) or unacceptable toxicity, whichever occurs first. Study evaluation&#xD;
      time is defined as up to 16 weeks after the first dosing of the last patient.&#xD;
