  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Testosterone is an anabolic steroid widely known to improve physical performance. Its&#xD;
      consumption is banned by the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA). The steroid profile is one of&#xD;
      the components of the Athlete's Biological Passport (ABP), which consists of selected&#xD;
      biological variables that indirectly reveal the effects of doping. Alcohol consumption has&#xD;
      been proved to alter the steroid profile and this may lead to the use of ethanol as a masking&#xD;
      agent for testosterone administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ratios of different testosterone biomarkers vary after ethanol administration:&#xD;
      [6-hydroxy-androsterone-3-glucuronide (6OH-Andros3G) / epitestosterone-glucuronide (EG)] and&#xD;
      [6-hydroxy-etiocholanolone-3-glucuronide (6OH-Etio3G) / EG] decrease, while&#xD;
      [testosterone-glucuronide (TG) / EG] increases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To evaluate if the combination of the markers TG, EG, 6OH-Andros3G and 6OH-Etio3G, as well as&#xD;
      ethyl glucuronide (EtG) and ethyl sulfate (EtS), can be routinely used to differentiate&#xD;
      between changes in the steroid profile due exclusively to the consumption of alcohol and&#xD;
      those produced when alcohol is consumed during a testosterone administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To explore the potential of the simultaneous determination of both phase I and phase II&#xD;
           metabolites in alternative matrices (plasma from blood samples collected as for the&#xD;
           haematological module of ABP, or saliva) in the screening of testosterone misuse.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To look for the differences into a comprehensive steroid profile (determined in urine,&#xD;
           plasma and saliva) between samples collected after testosterone administration and after&#xD;
           the combination of testosterone and ethanol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase I, single-blind, crossover-design clinical trial, placebo controlled, with 4 conditions&#xD;
      randomly assigned in male healthy caucasian subjects with a wash-out period between&#xD;
      treatments.&#xD;

             single or limited doses of symptomatic medicinal products in the week prior to the&#xD;
