      Lower extremity complications such as chronic diabetic foot ulcers (DFUs) are a major risk&#xD;
      for Type I/II diabetes patients. Minor injuries that would normally heal without consequence&#xD;
      in non-diabetic individuals are at greater risk of bacterial infection and progression to non&#xD;
      healing (chronic) wound status in diabetics, largely due to a loss of sensation in limbs&#xD;
      (neuropathy) and decreased blood flow (vascular disease). If not treated efficiently and&#xD;
      effectively, DFUs can have serious complications e.g. amputation, sepsis and death. The&#xD;
      investigators propose to address this significant unmet clinical need using a novel&#xD;
      commercial handheld fluorescence imaging product called the MolecuLight i:X (MolecuLight&#xD;
      Inc.) which images clinically-significant wound bacteria without contrast agents or patient&#xD;
      contact. Evidence in animal models of chronic wounds and multiple published clinical trials&#xD;
      (mainly DFUs) have shown significant clinical potential for fluorescence imaging to detect&#xD;
      potentially harmful bacteria in wounds otherwise invisible to doctors. The investigators have&#xD;
      shown that clinicians can easily, objectively and more accurately determine the likelihood of&#xD;
      bacterial infection than the standard of care. Moreover, published clinical evidence has&#xD;
      shown fluorescence imaging enables more accurate microbial wound sampling and guides more&#xD;
      targeted debridement of wounds to reduce bacteria levels. Our pilot data also show that when&#xD;
      used like this, the i:X device accelerates DFU wound healing, compared with current methods.&#xD;
      Thus, the investigators propose to expand the current pilot studies through a&#xD;
      statistically-powered 3 y randomized controlled trial to test the therapeutic benefit of&#xD;
      fluorescence-guided treatment for DFUs in a larger group of patients. A successful trial&#xD;
      could help reduce DFU healing times compared with standard practice (using a new Canadian&#xD;
      product) and improve patient quality of life, reduce amputation risk and alleviate health&#xD;
      care costs for diabetes complications in Canada and beyond.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Wound care is a major clinical challenge and presents an enormous burden to health care&#xD;
      worldwide. Wounds Canada describes chronic wounds as &quot;a Canadian healthcare crisis.&quot;&#xD;
      According to Wounds Canada and Diabetes Canada, approximately 15% of the 2.3 million diabetic&#xD;
      Canadians will develop a diabetic foot ulcer (DFU) and every 30 seconds someone in the world&#xD;
      loses a toe or limb to diabetes. Diabetics are about 23x more likely to be hospitalized for&#xD;
      amputations, approximately 85% of which are due to a previous DFU. Delayed wound healing has&#xD;
      been linked to a variety of factors including infection, which disrupts key biological&#xD;
      changes at the tissue and cellular level that are associated with the wound healing process.&#xD;
      Standard of care (SoC) of DFU infections involves visual inspection of the wound under white&#xD;
      light (WL) and identification of common signs of infection using the Clinical Signs and&#xD;
      Symptoms Checklist. However, SoC is limited by inconsistent guidelines and subjective&#xD;
      assessment. In addition, visual inspection and WL-guided sampling are inaccurate and&#xD;
      currently, no point-of-care technologies exist to assist the unaided eye. In response to this&#xD;
      gap, Dr. DaCosta (PI) and colleagues at University Health Network developed a handheld&#xD;
      fluorescence imaging platform (MolecuLight i:X) that detects bacterial autofluorescence in&#xD;
      wounds in real-time, at the point-of-care, and without the use of exogenous contrast agents.&#xD;
      The investigators propose a 3-year randomized control trial to test the therapeutic benefit&#xD;
      of AF-image guided intervention on DFU management using the i:X. The research questions are&#xD;
      Q1). Does AF-guided diagnosis and wound bed preparation improve wound healing in DFUs&#xD;
      relative to SoC alone? Q2). Does AF-guided intervention decrease the bioburden in DFUs&#xD;
      relative to SoC alone? Q3). Does AF-guided intervention improve patient quality of life&#xD;
      relative to SoC alone? Q4). Is AF-guided intervention associated with reduced treatment cost?&#xD;
      Primary objective: is to determine if AF-guided diagnosis and wound bed preparation improve&#xD;
      wound healing in DFUs compared to SoC alone. To measure this, the investigators will compare&#xD;
      between study arms i) the frequency of complete wound healing (CWH) at 12 weeks; ii) the&#xD;
      frequency of partial wound healing (PWH) at 6 and 12 weeks, CWH at 6 weeks, and mean&#xD;
      time-to-CWH (days); iii) the reduction in wound size at 12 weeks; and iv) the rate of wound&#xD;
      healing over 12 weeks. Secondary objective: is to determine if AF-guided intervention&#xD;
      decreases the bioburden in DFUs compared to SoC alone by evaluating bacterial diversity and&#xD;
      measuring bacteria load at specified regular intervals over 12 weeks. Tertiary objective: is&#xD;
      to determine if AF-guided intervention is associated with improved quality of life (QoL) and&#xD;
      with reduced treatment costs, which will be measured by using patient questionnaires and the&#xD;
      Canadian Institute for Health Information database.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If successful, this Randomized Control Trial (RCT) will demonstrate that AF image-guided&#xD;
      wound care improves time to CWH or PWH among Ontarians with DFUs by increasing wound healing&#xD;
      rates and reducing bioburden. If our technology can improve CWH by our target of &gt;= 16%&#xD;
      (absolute), an additional 55,000 Canadians could reach CWH by 12 weeks, resulting in reduced&#xD;
      wound care costs and improved QoL. The average cost of treating a DFU is $5000-8000/patient.&#xD;
      Improving the number of patients that achieve CWH by &gt;= 16% will substantially reduce costs&#xD;
      associated with treating DFUs in Canada. The results of this study may inform health policy&#xD;
      decisions and recommendations for changes to current SoC DFU practice guidelines. Health&#xD;
      economic and QoL comparison of AF-guided wound care vs SoC in the proposed RCT will help&#xD;
      define the overall value proposition of the new approach. If the investigators fail to&#xD;
      demonstrate improved wound healing rates, this will also be of value to physicians, patients&#xD;
      and the Canadian health care system. Knowing not to further pursue this line of research is&#xD;
      important in an era of limited funding.&#xD;

The % of patients achieving PWH will be evaluated at 6 and 12-wk and compared between study arms. To validate CWH, images of wounds identified as having reached 100% re-epithelialization by the wound care clinician will be photographed under WL and sent for review by at least 2 independent blinded researchers.</description>

    <description>Wounds will be assessed by autofluorescence (AF)-guided SoC. A baseline WL and AF photo will be taken of the wound. AF images will guide SoC including targeted debridement of areas of bacterial growth (AF+) and targeted sampling in areas of residual bacterial growth post-debridement. If no bacterial AF is detected, sample will be obtained from the wound center by curettage technique. If AF is detected, AF-guided debridement will be repeated and additional images will be obtained until 1) no AF is detected or 2) further debridement is not medically advised. After wound bed preparation, a second set of WL and AF images will be taken. Wounds will be dressed as per SoC. At all visits, samples will be sent for microbiology analysis. At 6- and 12-week visits (or any other scheduled visits in between), microbiology reports will be shared with clinicians if they were not collected outside of SoC.</description>
