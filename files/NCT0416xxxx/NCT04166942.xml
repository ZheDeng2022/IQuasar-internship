      The primary objective of the study is:&#xD;
&#xD;
      • To assess the pharmacokinetics (PK) of KD025 following a single oral dose of KD025 in&#xD;
      subjects with mild, moderate, or severe hepatic impairment compared to healthy subjects with&#xD;
      normal hepatic function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objectives of the study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the safety and tolerability of a single oral dose of KD025 in subjects with&#xD;
           mild, moderate, or severe hepatic impairment, and in healthy subjects with normal&#xD;
           hepatic function.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the PK of the KD025 metabolites following a single oral dose of KD025 in&#xD;
           subjects with mild, moderate, or severe hepatic impairment compared to healthy subjects&#xD;
           with normal hepatic function.&#xD;
