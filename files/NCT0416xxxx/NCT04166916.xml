  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sleep and particularly deep sleep are playing an important role for brain and body health.&#xD;
      Poor sleep has been associated with risk factors for cardiovascular disease and moreover, is&#xD;
      hypothesized to increased mortality risk of cardiovascular diseases. Yet, the role of&#xD;
      specific sleep processes for cardiovascular function remains unclear. Particularly deep&#xD;
      sleep, which is manifested by large amplitude, low frequency oscillations is of importance&#xD;
      for the restorative functions of sleep. Thus, the modulation of deep sleep by auditory&#xD;
      stimulation will be of central interests to assess the cause-effect relationship of specific&#xD;
      processes within sleep for cardiovascular regulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will assess the effects of slow wave modulating auditory stimulation on&#xD;
      cardiovasuclar functions in healthy male participants.&#xD;
