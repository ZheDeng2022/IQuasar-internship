  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Breast and colon cancers are commonly diagnosed cancers among women after skin cancer in&#xD;
      Maryland. Patients' preferences for cancer screening are known to significantly influence&#xD;
      utilization, and thus impact health outcomes. In a recent study the investigators conducted&#xD;
      at Johns Hopkins Bayview Medical Center, the investigators observed that among women age&#xD;
      50-75 years admitted to general medicine services over 4-month period, 40% were non-adherent&#xD;
      to breast cancer screening (overdue) despite being insured.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, the investigators propose to establish a cohort of hospitalized women to help the&#xD;
      investigators develop successful interventions for enhancing breast cancer screening&#xD;
      utilization in this group. In following a cohort prospectively, the investigators intend to&#xD;
      both reaffirm the results from the investigators' previous study and determine whether the&#xD;
      patterns of mammographic screening improve over time as a result of the investigators'&#xD;
      interventions. Among non-adherent (overdue) women, the investigators will educate and&#xD;
      encourage these women to undergo outpatient screening mammography.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To more comprehensively assess the preventive health in this cohort, the investigators will&#xD;
      assess the cohort's adherence to colon cancer screening recommendation and barriers to colon&#xD;
      cancer screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition the investigators will also like to encourage the hospitalists and house staff&#xD;
      taking care of these patients to perform oral cancer screen among women who smoke&#xD;
      (non-adherent to breast cancer screening) Finally the investigators will also like to ask the&#xD;
      perspective of cancer screening among these women.&#xD;
