  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the influence of virtual reality (VR) on the different&#xD;
      parameters, happiness, quality of life and functional fitness, among older population. The&#xD;
      study aims to conduct a randomized controlled trial, where the participants in intervention&#xD;
      group will use VR and those in control group do not use VR.&#xD;

      This study aims to conduct a randomized control trial, on 60 older age group participants,&#xD;
      and perform the functional fitness test based on the protocol developed by Rikli and Jones,&#xD;
      before and after the VR intervention. The functional fitness tests include evaluation of&#xD;
      upper body strength, lower body strength, cardiorespiratory endurance, upper body flexibility&#xD;
      test, lower body flexibility test, balance, agility test. They will be randomly assigned to&#xD;
      the intervention group, receiving the VR program, and the control group who will not receive&#xD;
      the VR program. The participants in the intervention group will be asked to use the VR device&#xD;
      for 15 minutes, twice a week for 6 weeks, along with their daily routine activities. Control&#xD;
      group will carry out the daily routine activities, without the intervention. The change in&#xD;
      the quality of life (QOL) and happiness, for both control and intervention groups, will be&#xD;
      assessed through EuroQol 5 dimensions 3 level questionnaire (EQ-5D-3L), mini version of&#xD;
      Chinese happiness Inventory questionnaire, respectively, to filled at recruitment and&#xD;
      follow-up after 6 weeks. The effect of the VR programs will be determined by the comparison&#xD;
      of performance, for the functional fitness tests before and after the intervention and also,&#xD;
      for the differences between the control and intervention groups&#xD;
