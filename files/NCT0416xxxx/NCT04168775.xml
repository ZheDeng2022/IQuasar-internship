  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Recent studies have reported that some COPD patients may have a suboptimal ability to&#xD;
      generate a sufficient inspiratory effort to achieve adequate lung delivery of inhaled&#xD;
      medications through dry powder inhalers. Sparse data is available about the inspiratory&#xD;
      capacity of these patients in the home setting, whether clinically stable or when&#xD;
      experiencing worsened respiratory symptoms outside the acute care setting. This study is&#xD;
      undertaken to better understand the proportion of patients with suboptimal peak inspiratory&#xD;
      flow rate (sPIFR) measurements amongst COPD patients receiving dry powder inhaler(s) (DPI) in&#xD;
      the ambulatory setting. Further, the study will characterize PIFR over time, the variability&#xD;
      of PIFR measurements, and the associations with potential predictors (demographics, clinical,&#xD;
      PRO, body position, and device) as well as exacerbations frequency and change in PIFR around&#xD;
      period of exacerbation.&#xD;
