  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the safety and efficacy of Anlotinib (AL3818) combined&#xD;
      with pembrolizumab (MK-3475) in treatment-naïve adults with no prior systemic therapy for&#xD;
      advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) whose tumors have a programmed cell death-ligand&#xD;
      1 (PD-L1) Tumor Proportion Score (TPS) greater than or equal to 1%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary study hypotheses is that the combination of Anlotinib and pembrolizumab is&#xD;
      superior to pembrolizumab alone(historical data) as assessed by Progression-free Survival&#xD;
      (PFS) per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors version 1.1 (RECIST 1.1).&#xD;
