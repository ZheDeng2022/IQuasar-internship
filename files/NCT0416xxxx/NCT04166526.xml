  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sickle Cell Disease (SCD) impairs oxygen transport to tissue and causes endothelial injury.&#xD;
      Thus, therapeutic interventions aim to improve both, but there is an unmet need for&#xD;
      biomarkers to determine when intervention is necessary and evaluate the effectiveness of the&#xD;
      chosen intervention in individual patients. This study proposes to monitor SCD and its&#xD;
      treatment through their impact on cerebral hemodynamics, as the brain is one of the most&#xD;
      vulnerable and consequential targets of the disease. Specifically, this study will optimize&#xD;
      quantitative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and advanced optical spectroscopy techniques&#xD;
      such as frequency-domain near-infrared and diffuse correlation spectroscopies (FDNIRS-DCS) to&#xD;
      monitor 1) cerebral oxygen transport with measures of cerebral blood flow (CBF), cerebral&#xD;
      oxygen extraction fraction (OEF) and cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen consumption (CMRO2)&#xD;
      and 2) endothelial function with cerebrovascular reactivity (CVR).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additionally, this study aims to monitor baseline cerebral oxygen transport and CVR, as well&#xD;
      as changes that occur with treatment (transfusion or genetic therapy to induce fetal&#xD;
      hemoglobin) and assess hemoglobinopathy patients with known genotypes and phenotypes. The&#xD;
      ultimate goal is to demonstrate the potential of this monitoring approach to select&#xD;
      individual SCD subjects for interventions and evaluate individual responses to treatment.&#xD;
      Success will help justify inclusion of these modalities in ongoing and future clinical trials&#xD;
      of novel SCD therapies.&#xD;
