      Apremilast mediates its clinical effect through the cAMP-PKA-NFkappaB pathway which results&#xD;
      in a clinical picture changes to a decrease of all signs of inflammation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Due to the NFkappaB mediated chronical inflammation in the pathogenesis of acne conglobata, a&#xD;
      treatment with Apremilast seems to be an effective option.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, treatment with Apremilast (Otezla®) will be performed in patients with acne&#xD;
      conglobata to observe its preliminary efficacy and safety in an open label, single-centre&#xD;
      proof of concept study design.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Treatment options for acne conglobata are limited and those which are effective can only be&#xD;
      used in short term such as systemic steroids, antibiotics or retinoids due to their&#xD;
      association to side effects or potentially teratogenetic effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Apremilast, a specific inhibitor for PDE-4, mediates its clinical effect through the&#xD;
      cAMP-PKA-NFkappaB pathway which results in a decrease of pro-inflammatory and increase of&#xD;
      anti-inflammatory cytokines in several types of leukocytes. The clinical picture changes to a&#xD;
      decrease of all signs of inflammation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Due to the NFkappaB mediated chronical inflammation in the pathogenesis of acne conglobata, a&#xD;
      treatment with Apremilast seems to be an effective option.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, treatment with Apremilast (Otezla®) will be performed in patients with acne&#xD;
      conglobata to observe its preliminary efficacy and safety in an open label, single-centre&#xD;
