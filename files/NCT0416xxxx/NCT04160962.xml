      For the patients with early gastric cancer (T1), preoperative evaluation (gastroscope,&#xD;
      ultrasound gastroscope and abdominal enhanced CT) showed that the tumor was located in the&#xD;
      body of the stomach, and the margin was enough to retain the pylorus and non lymph node&#xD;
      metastasis (N0). Lappg (D1 + lymph node dissection) and traditional laparoscopic distal&#xD;
      gastrectomy (BII type anastomosis, D1 + lymph node dissection) were included A control study&#xD;
      was conducted to evaluate the difference of long-term quality of life, gastric emptying rate,&#xD;
      incidence of basic reflux gastritis, bile contraction function, immune index, nutritional&#xD;
      index and disease-free survival and overall survival between the two groups.&#xD;

      The overall design of this study is an experimental study based on the real world. All the&#xD;
      patients in the study group were from early gastric cancer patients who were operated on in&#xD;
      gastrointestinal surgery of Renji Hospital. According to the preoperative evaluation of early&#xD;
      gastric cancer (gastroscope, ultrasonic gastroscope and abdominal enhanced CT), patients with&#xD;
      early gastric cancer whose tumor is located in the gastric body and whose cutting edge is&#xD;
      enough to retain pylorus and non lymph node metastasis (N0) were included in the study. Group&#xD;
      A (Study Group): lappg treatment group, group B (control group): laparoscopic distal&#xD;
      gastrectomy type I group. In this study, group A was taken as the study group and group B as&#xD;
      the control group Group, the differences between groups were compared. The main end point was&#xD;
      the quality of life score (eortc-qlq-c30 scale, see the attached table). According to the&#xD;
      literature and the data of the retrospective study of the center, it was assumed that the&#xD;
      expected mean of the study group after treatment was 7.27, the mean of the control group&#xD;
      after treatment was 6.76, and the total standard deviation of the test group and the control&#xD;
      group was 0.51. The design of the test group and the control group was 1:1. According to&#xD;
      this, two independent α = 0.05 were carried out Test of the average number of standing&#xD;
      samples. It is calculated that 144 patients (72 in each group) are needed, so that under the&#xD;
      test level of α = 0.05, according to 80% test efficiency, the difference between the two&#xD;
      groups is statistically significant. Assuming that 10% of the patients could not be evaluated&#xD;
      (shedding), 80 patients in each group were enrolled, and 160 patients in both groups were&#xD;
      enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2) inclusion / exclusion / withdrawal criteria of subjects&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria: 18 years old &lt; age &lt; 75 years old; primary gastric lesions were diagnosed&#xD;
      as gastric adenocarcinoma by tissue biopsy; preoperative clinical stage was T1N0M0 according&#xD;
      to ajcc-7thtnm tumor stage; the tumor site was expected to receive R0 after pylorus&#xD;
      preserving gastrectomy and D1 + lymph node dissection; preoperative Eastern Cooperative&#xD;
      Oncology Group physical state score was 0 / 1; preoperative ASA score was I-III, with&#xD;
      informed consent of the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria: pregnant or lactating women; severe mental illness; history of upper&#xD;
      abdominal surgery (except for laparoscopic cholecystectomy); history of gastric surgery&#xD;
      (including endoscopic submucosal dissection/ endoscopic mucosal resection for gastric&#xD;
      cancer); preoperative imaging examination showed regional enlarged lymph nodes; history of&#xD;
      other malignant diseases within 5 years; patients with gastric cancer who have implemented&#xD;
      new adjuvant treatment or recommended new adjuvant treatment; no History of stable angina&#xD;
      pectoris or myocardial infarction; history of cerebral infarction or cerebral hemorrhage&#xD;
      within 6 months; history of continuous systemic corticosteroid therapy within 1 month;&#xD;
      simultaneous operation for other diseases; emergency operation for gastric cancer with&#xD;
      complications (hemorrhage, perforation, obstruction).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Withdrawal criteria: conversion to laparotomy; intraoperative / postoperative pathological&#xD;
      confirmation of tumor invasion depth exceeding T1, or tumor invasion of duodenum;&#xD;
      intraoperative / postoperative pathological confirmation of lymph node metastasis;&#xD;
      intraoperative / postoperative pathological confirmation of M1 cases; intraoperative&#xD;
      confirmation of failure to complete D1 + lymph node dissection / R0 due to tumor reasons;&#xD;
      intraoperative confirmation of the need for total gastrectomy to ensure safe proximity; need&#xD;
      for other diseases During the same period of the study, the patients were operated at the&#xD;
      same time; because of severe complications (unable to tolerate surgery or anesthesia) during&#xD;
      the perioperative period, the treatment plan of the study was not suitable or could not be&#xD;
      implemented according to the plan; after entering the study, because of the patient's&#xD;
      condition change, the emergency operation was confirmed by the doctor in charge; at any stage&#xD;
      after entering the study, the patients voluntarily requested to withdraw or suspend the&#xD;
      treatment due to the patient's personal reasons Treatment; treatment proven to be in&#xD;
      violation of this protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3) end point of study&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary endpoint: 5-year quality of life assessment [time window: 5 years after operation].&#xD;
      Secondary endpoint: 3-year quality of life [time window: 3 years after operation]; immune&#xD;
      index [time window: 5 years after operation]; nutritional index [time window: 5 years after&#xD;
      operation]; gastric emptying rate [time window: 5 years after operation]; incidence of basic&#xD;
      reflux gastritis [time window: 5 years after operation]; gallbladder contraction function&#xD;
      [time window: 5 years after operation]; 5-year total survival rate [time window: 5 years&#xD;
      after operation] 5 years; 5-year recurrence free survival [time window: 5 years after&#xD;
      operation].&#xD;
&#xD;
      4) diagnostic criteria for this study&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, ajcc-7th primary tumor, regional nodes, metastasis tumor staging system was&#xD;
      used; the diagnostic criteria and classification of gastric cancer were based on the&#xD;
      international diagnostic criteria of histopathology; the definition of early gastric cancer:&#xD;
      tumor infiltration was limited to the mucosa and submucosa, and did not invade the muscular&#xD;
      layer (T1); in this study, T1N0 was the study object, but not the study object.&#xD;
&#xD;
      5) interventions&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to the preoperative evaluation (gastroscope, ultrasonic gastroscope and abdominal&#xD;
      enhanced CT), the tumor is located in the body of the stomach, and the cutting edge is enough&#xD;
      to retain the pylorus and early gastric cancer without lymph node metastasis (N0). By&#xD;
      randomized grouping, the laparoscopic pylorus preserving gastrectomy (lappg, D1 +&#xD;
      lymphadenectomy) and traditional laparoscopic distal gastrectomy (BII type anastomosis, D1 +&#xD;
      lymphadenectomy) are performed Bed operation intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      6) statistical analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
      In demographic indicators, numerical variables are mainly described by means of means and&#xD;
      standard deviations, and classified variables are mainly described by rates or ratios.&#xD;
      T-test, chi square test or nonparametric test can be used to test the equilibrium of two&#xD;
      groups of demography.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis method of main index and secondary index. The main index is patients'&#xD;
      postoperative quality of life score (postscript symptom scores), which is a numerical&#xD;
      variable. The statistical description mainly uses mean and standard deviation. Statistical&#xD;
      inference uses t-test, ANOVA or nonparametric test according to data distribution conditions.&#xD;
      The secondary indicators involve the expression of usage rate of classified statistical&#xD;
      description, and the expression of chi square test of statistical inference hypothesis test.&#xD;
      If there is no balance between the two groups, we can use multiple regression to adjust the&#xD;
      confounding factors and compare the difference between the two groups.&#xD;
