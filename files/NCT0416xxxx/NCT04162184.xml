  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will utilize mixed methods to develop and assess the feasibility and acceptability&#xD;
      of a health educator intervention designed to connect patients in recovery from substance use&#xD;
      disorder to reproductive health education and services.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Developing effective reproductive health interventions for individuals in treatment for&#xD;
      substance use disorder is an important public health priority. In the US nearly half (45%) of&#xD;
      all pregnancies are unplanned and studies have consistently found this rate to be much higher&#xD;
      among individuals in substance treatment, almost 90%. There is a paucity of research on&#xD;
      interventions to support the family planning care of this population. The primary goal of&#xD;
      this project is to identify an innovative delivery model to address the family planning needs&#xD;
      of individuals of reproductive age in treatment for substance use disorder at an urban&#xD;
      integrated safety-net health system. Through the use of mixed methods this study will address&#xD;
      the following objectives: 1) To describe the family planning experiences and needs of&#xD;
      individuals in treatment for substance use disorders (SUD) in a representative sample of&#xD;
      patients and 2) To assess the feasibility and acceptability of the intervention among study&#xD;
      participants. If found to be acceptable, efficacy should be assessed in a randomized&#xD;
      controlled trial. A navigator model such as this is generalizable and could be easily&#xD;
      integrated into a variety of settings.&#xD;

    <description>Intervention acceptability will be assessed by participant self-reported satisfaction with the intervention (via surveys) among those who complete the intervention sessions. Satisfaction will be assessed with 8 items on a 4-point scale describing how strongly participants agree with each statement. The response scale is coded so that a higher score reflects higher satisfaction and therefore a better outcome. Reported as mean overall score (range 1-32).</description>

    <description>As the population of focus in this study is diverse, including men and women regardless of pregnancy desire, the primary focus for the intervention for this study will be education, particularly for men. All participants that enroll in the study will be offered the intervention. The study health educator will use the PATH (Parenthood/Pregnancy Attitude, Timing, and How) framework questions to initially guide the conversation. Depending on the participant's desires, the educator will provide education on other topics such as sexually transmitted infections (STIs) and we will also navigate to clinical services as needed. The health educator will use a study manual to guide all intervention activities including engagement. Additionally, the health educator will collect data on intervention outreach, engagement, topics discussed, participant needs and outcomes.</description>
