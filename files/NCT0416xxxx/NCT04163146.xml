    <textblock>
      Long-term variability analysis of peak expiratory flow (PEF) and forced expiratory volume in&#xD;
      1 s (FEV1) has been successfully used in research to predict the exacerbation of the disease&#xD;
      in adult individuals with asthma. However, there is a paucity of data regarding PEF and FEV1&#xD;
      variability in asthmatic children and adolescents. Such a task requires at least daily PEF&#xD;
      and FEV1 measurements, recording in diaries, and periodic evaluation of the data. The process&#xD;
      may be proven both complicated and time consuming, thus reducing patients' adherence. Recent&#xD;
      advances in biosensor technology have permitted the development of reliable, low-cost,&#xD;
      portable spirometers, able to connect with smartphones and monitor lung function parameters&#xD;
      in real time and from a distance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objectives of the present study is the assessment of PEF and FEV1 variability: a) in&#xD;
      healthy children and adolescents, in order to define the normal daily fluctuation of PEF and&#xD;
      FEV1 and the parameters that may influence it, and b) in children and adolescents with&#xD;
      asthma, in order to explore the differences from healthy subjects and reveal any specific&#xD;
      variability changes prior to exacerbation. Such data would improve our understanding&#xD;
      regarding the disease and permit the development of integrated tools for assessing the level&#xD;
      of asthma control and the risk of future exacerbations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will include 100 healthy children and adolescents aged 6 to 18 years for the&#xD;
      assessment of normal PEF and FEV1 variability, and 100 children and adolescents of the same&#xD;
      age with diagnosed asthma for the assessment of PEF and FEV1 variability in asthmatics. PEF&#xD;
      and FEV1 measurements will be performed using an FDA-approved portable spirometer (MIR&#xD;
      Spirobank Smart) capable to connect to smartphone. Each participant will receive his personal&#xD;
      spirometer. Measurements will be performed twice a day between 07:00-09:00 and 19:00-21:00&#xD;
      hours and dispatched via email to a central database for a period of 3 months. PEF and FEV1&#xD;
      variability will be assessed by detrended fluctuation analysis, aiming to define the normal&#xD;
      pattern (healthy controls) and to detect and quantify the deviations (asthmatics). The&#xD;
      anticipated duration of the study is 24 months.&#xD;

      Background&#xD;
&#xD;
      Asthma represents the most common chronic disease of childhood and adolescence and an&#xD;
      important cause of morbidity worldwide. The disease is characterized by episodes of&#xD;
      reversible airway obstruction (exacerbations), associated with specific symptoms (wheeze,&#xD;
      dyspnea, cough, chest tightness) and decrease in peak expiratory flow (PEF) and forced&#xD;
      expiratory volume at 1 sec (FEV1). However, these spirometric changes occur in parallel with&#xD;
      clinical deterioration, thus presenting limited ability to predict the exacerbation of the&#xD;
      disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both PEF and FEV1 demonstrate significant daily variability, i.e., circadian and/or&#xD;
      day-by-day fluctuation of the measured values. In healthy individuals the pattern of these&#xD;
      fluctuations remains constant over long time periods (weeks, months), as opposed to asthmatic&#xD;
      patients where PEF and FEV1 variability is increased, especially prior to exacerbations when&#xD;
      the control of the disease is lost. Thus, the analysis of PEF and FEV1 variability has been&#xD;
      used in research to evaluate the effectiveness of treatment, recognize high-risk patients and&#xD;
      predict asthma exacerbations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In clinical practice, however, the evaluation of PEF and FEV1 variability requires at least&#xD;
      daily measurements with special devices, recording in diaries, and periodic evaluation of the&#xD;
      data by the attending physicians. The process may be proven both complicated and time&#xD;
      consuming, thus reducing patients' adherence especially in the case of asthmatic children and&#xD;
      adolescents. In addition, the periodic review of measurements may hamper the prediction of&#xD;
      exacerbation, as the time of evaluation may not coincide with changes in the variability of&#xD;
      lung function that characterize the loss of asthma control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Over the last years, technological advancements in the field of biosensors and&#xD;
      microprocessors have permitted the development of reliable, low-cost, portable spirometers,&#xD;
      able to connect with cutting-edge mobile phones (smartphones) and monitor lung function&#xD;
      parameters in real time and from a distance. The use of such devices may overcome most of the&#xD;
      aforementioned barriers in following-up lung function parameters in the long term.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently, there is a paucity of data regarding PEF and FEV1 variability in children and&#xD;
      adolescents with asthma. Such data would improve our understanding regarding the disease and&#xD;
      permit the development of integrated tools for assessing the level of asthma control and the&#xD;
      risk of future exacerbations&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objectives of the study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Assessment of PEF and FEV1 variability in healthy children and adolescents: definition&#xD;
           of the normal range of daily PEF and FEV1 fluctuation and the parameters that may&#xD;
           influence it&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Assessment of PEF and FEV1 variability in children and adolescents with asthma:&#xD;
           differences from healthy subjects and definition of specific changes prior to&#xD;
           exacerbation&#xD;
&#xD;
           Methods&#xD;
&#xD;
           A. Study population&#xD;
&#xD;
           The study will include two cohorts:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Healthy children and adolescents aged 6 to 18 years (N=100) for the assessment of&#xD;
                normal PEF and FEV1 variability (objective #1).&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Children and adolescents aged 6 to 18 years with diagnosed asthma [2] (N=100) for&#xD;
                the assessment of PEF and FEV1 variability in asthmatics (objective #2).&#xD;
&#xD;
           B. Lung function measurements&#xD;
&#xD;
           a. Device: PEF and FEV1 measurements will be performed using an FDA-approved portable&#xD;
           spirometer (Spirobank Smart, MIR, Rome, Italy), with a disposable bi-directional digital&#xD;
           turbine (flow range ±16L/s, volume accuracy ±3% or 50 mL, flow accuracy: ±5% or 200&#xD;
           mL/s, dynamic resistance &lt;0.5 cm H2O/L/s), capable to connect to smartphone via&#xD;
           Bluetooth® using a dedicated freeware application (iSpirometry, MIR, Rome, Italy). Each&#xD;
           participant will receive his personal spirometer. Detailed information regarding the use&#xD;
           and maintenance of the device will be provided (brochure &amp; online resources).&#xD;
&#xD;
           b. Measurements: The correct technique for PEF and FEV1 measurements (ERS/ATS standards)&#xD;
           will be demonstrated by one of the investigators at enrollment. Detailed information&#xD;
           regarding the technique (brochure &amp; online resources) will be also provided.&#xD;
           Measurements will be performed twice a day between 07:00-09:00 and 19:00-21:00 hours,&#xD;
           for a period of 3 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
           c. Completed measurements (encrypted pdf format) will be dispatched via email to a&#xD;
           central database by the participants or their parents.&#xD;
&#xD;
           d. Monitoring: Participants' adherence will be monitored continuously. The investigators&#xD;
           will notify the participants in case of lost measurements or inappropriate technique.&#xD;
&#xD;
           C. Variability analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
           PEF and FEV1 variability will be assessed by:&#xD;
&#xD;
           a. The coefficient of variation b. Detrended Fluctuation Analysis (DFA), a method that&#xD;
           has been widely used for the investigation of intrinsic correlation within time&#xD;
           series.14 Initially, the square root of the time series [F(n)] is calculated for&#xD;
           segments of different (time) length n. A linear relationship in the logarithmic graph F&#xD;
           (n) - log (n) indicates the existence of fractal architecture in the scaling of the&#xD;
           specific data, while the slope a of the line describes the pattern of long-term&#xD;
           fluctuations.14 A change in daily variability of PEF or FEV1 results in a simultaneous&#xD;
           deviation from the predetermined a value.6 This deviation can easily be detected and&#xD;
           quantified. It has been shown that the magnitude of a deviation reflects the likelihood&#xD;
           of asthma exacerbation within the next month.6 c. Variability analysis will be performed&#xD;
           in MatLab (MathWorks, Inc., Natick, MA, USA) environment.&#xD;
&#xD;
           D. Additional data Patients' characteristics (age, sex, baseline lung function, allergy,&#xD;
           comorbidities, medication, etc) will be also recorded. These parameters will be included&#xD;
           in regression models to explore their effect on the pattern of PEF and FEV1 variability.&#xD;
&#xD;
           E. Statistics All analyses will be performed with the IBM SPSS software version 25.0&#xD;
           (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY).&#xD;
&#xD;
           F. Timeframes The expected duration of the study is 24 months. • Part I: Assessment of&#xD;
