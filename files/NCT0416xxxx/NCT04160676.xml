  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study , we suggest that the use of combination of Hydrocortisone, Ascorbic Acid, and&#xD;
      Thiamine in patient with sepsis may decrease mortality rate and improve the outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will be carried out at SICU of Tanta University hospitals on Patients aged from 18&#xD;
      to 65 years old who will be presented with sepsis that diagnosed according to the surviving&#xD;
      sepsis campaign 2016.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who will meet the previous criteria will be enrolled in the study. The patients will&#xD;
      be randomized allocated into two groups by the aid of computer generated software of&#xD;
      randomization introduced into sealed closed envelops.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will receive the conventional therapy according to the surviving sepsis campaign&#xD;
      2016 and The Surviving Sepsis Campaign Bundle 2018 Update.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients will be allocated randomly into one of the following two groups;-. Group I The&#xD;
      patients in this group will be managed only according to the surviving sepsis campaign 2016&#xD;
      and the surviving sepsis campaign bundle 2018 update.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients will receive 50 ml normal saline I.V within 30 mins / 6 h, 10 ml normal saline&#xD;
      I.V / 6 h, 5 ml normal saline I.V / 12 h.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group II The patients will receive the conventional therapy of sepsis and combined therapy of&#xD;
      hydrocortisone (Solucortif® 100 mg , vial, dried powder Pfizer, Egypt) 50 mg diluted in 5 ml&#xD;
      normal saline IV / 6 h, ascorbic acid (VITAMIN C-®, Amp, ROTEXMEDICA, Germany, 500mg/5ml) 1.5&#xD;
      gm diluted in 50 ml normal saline IV within 30 min /6 h , and thiamine (Vitamin&#xD;
      B1-injektopas®, Ampoule, Germany, 100 mg / 2 ml) 200 mg diluted in 10 ml normal saline IV /12&#xD;
      h The outcome of the patients, the incidence of organ dysfunction will be assessed.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This prospective randomized controlled double-blinded study will be carried out at surgical&#xD;
      intensive care units (SICU) in Tanta University Hospitals for a period of 12 months that may&#xD;
      be extended after approval from institutional ethical committee.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An informed written consent will be obtained from the patients or patients' relatives.&#xD;
&#xD;
      They will receive an explanation of the purpose of the study and every patient will have a&#xD;
      secret code number.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research results will be only used for scientific purpose. Any unexpected risk/s appearing&#xD;
      during the course of research will be clarified to the participants and to the ethical&#xD;
      committee on time, however, the patients that will be enrolled in this study have no expected&#xD;
      additional risk as we use Hydrocortisone, Ascorbic acid and Thiamin that have minimal side&#xD;
      effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      *Inclusion criteria: Patients aged from 18 to 65 years old who will be presented with sepsis&#xD;
      that diagnosed according to the surviving sepsis campaign 2016(21) and The Surviving Sepsis&#xD;

      2016 and The Surviving Sepsis Campaign Bundle 2018 Update.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An intensivist who has no further role in this research work will help in the preparation of&#xD;
      the used medications in syringes that will contain medications in group two and normal saline&#xD;
      in group one.&#xD;
&#xD;
      (placebo) -I Group The patients in this group will be managed only according to the surviving&#xD;
      sepsis campaign 2016 and the surviving sepsis campaign bundle 2018 update.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients will receive 50 ml normal saline I.V within 30 mins / 6 h, 10 ml normal saline&#xD;
      I.V / 6 h, 5 ml normal saline I.V / 12 h.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group II The patients will receive the conventional therapy of sepsis and combined therapy of&#xD;
      hydrocortisone (Solucortif® 100 mg , vial, dried powder Pfizer, Egypt) 50 mg diluted in 5 ml&#xD;

      B1-injektopas®, Ampoule, Germany, 100 mg / 2 ml) 200 mg diluted in 10 ml normal saline IV /12&#xD;
      h This combined therapy will be given for 4 days or to the time of discharge if the admission&#xD;
      period is less than 4 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      *Measurements&#xD;
&#xD;
      All data will be collected by intensivists who will be blinded about the study groups. All&#xD;
      the patients will be subjected to the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Demographic data (age, gender, weight, cause of sepsis).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. 28th day mortality (If the patient will be discharged, data will be collected by phone&#xD;
           calls)&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Sofa score will be recorded daily and compared during the period of the studied drugs&#xD;
           administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Incidence of organ dysfunction during the period of ICU stay.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Mean arterial blood pressure will be recorded every 8 hrs and compared during the period&#xD;
           of the studied drugs adminstration.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Cardiac index will be measured every 8 hrs using Electrical Cardiometry monitor, ICON&#xD;
           Cardiotronics, Inc., La Jolla, CA 92307; Osypka Medical GmbH, Berlin,Germany and will be&#xD;
           compared between both groups during the period of the studied drugs adminstration.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Total dose of vasopressor therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. Serum lactate level will be measured daily during the period of the studied drugs&#xD;
           administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
        9. Serum pocalcitonin level will be measured at time of starting the studied drugs&#xD;
           administration and at the end of it.&#xD;
