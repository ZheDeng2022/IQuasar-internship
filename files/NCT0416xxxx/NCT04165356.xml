    <textblock>
      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Infections associated with mechanical ventilation are associated with high rates of morbidity&#xD;
      and mortality, which results not only in an increase in hospitalization days and care costs,&#xD;
      but also in an increase in DALYS (years of life disability adjustment) in the population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Critically ill patients have a high risk of infection as a result of underlying&#xD;
      immunodeficiency, comorbidity and placement of invasive devices (such as endotracheal tubes&#xD;
      and intravascular devices). Infections in these patients constitute a challenge for hospital&#xD;
      authorities, as they are considered a social and economic problem that influences the quality&#xD;
      of care, in a system where health services are increasingly affected by high patient care&#xD;
      costs and the reduction of public spending.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The decrease in the number of bacteria in the oral cavity reduces the presence of&#xD;
      microorganisms available for translocation and colonization of the lower respiratory tract;&#xD;
      Therefore, performing oral care intervention is considered an economically attractive method&#xD;
      to reduce the risk of developing infections associated with endotracheal intubation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In our environment, oral cleaning is performed as part of the nursing care package granted to&#xD;
      all patients of the ICU, however, there is no standardized method among nursing staff that&#xD;
      guarantees the desired prevention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of mouth-rinse with 0.12% chlorhexidine to&#xD;
      prevent infections associated with mechanical ventilation in patients in the intensive care&#xD;
      unit in a third level hospital in Mérida, Yucatán.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: Mouth-rinse with 0.12% chlorhexidine twice daily more effective and safe than&#xD;
      mouthwash with bicarbonated isotonic solution twice daily to prevent infections associated&#xD;
      with mechanical ventilation in patients in the intensive care unit of a hospital third level.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology: Double-blind randomized controlled clinical trial with active substance for the&#xD;
      evaluation of the non-inferiority of the efficacy and safety of mouthwash with 0.12%&#xD;
      chlorhexidine twice daily compared to isotonic bicarbonated solution twice daily for the&#xD;
      prevention of any infection associated with mechanical ventilation in patients requiring&#xD;
      endotracheal intubation in the intensive care unit of a third level hospital.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Eligibility criteria Adult patients admitted to the ICU will be included, with less than 24&#xD;
      hours of endotracheal intubation due to mechanical ventilation requirements, whose&#xD;
      responsible family member gives informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with known hypersensitivity or contraindications for the use of oral chlorhexidine,&#xD;
      patients with a diagnosis of admission to the ICU of any respiratory tract infection,&#xD;
      toothless patients and pregnant patients will be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who, during their stay in ICU, require tracheostomy after having endotracheal&#xD;
      intubation and those who decide to withdraw their informed consent will be eliminated from&#xD;
      the active phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adverse events surveillance During the period of the permanence of the subject in the&#xD;
      clinical trial, daily monitoring of adverse events and the response variable will be carried&#xD;
      out, taking information from the clinical record, the results of cultures performed on the&#xD;
      patient and supplemented with hospital surveillance reports.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment assignation According to the randomization of the subject, a bottle of mouthwash&#xD;
      labeled with the clinical trial data will be assigned for personal use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The said bottle may correspond to one of two treatments:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Mouth-rinse with 0.12% chlorhexidine, 35 ml spray bottle, with a capacity of 200 shots,&#xD;
           Clorhex-gum® brand.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Mouth-rinse with an isotonic solution with 1.5% sodium bicarbonate, 35ml spray bottle,&#xD;
           with a capacity of approximately 200 shots.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All mouth-rinse bottles will have the same external appearance, being plastic bottles with&#xD;
      integrated spray atomizer and protective plastic cap. Each bottle will have a unique folio&#xD;
      for identification printed on the identification label.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The mouthwash bottles will be stored in the hospital area, under the shelter of the&#xD;
      participating clinical staff, in a cool, dark and locked space.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once the vial has been assigned to a patient, it will remain next to the subject's bed for&#xD;
      the sole and individual use of the said subject.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blind and no blind staff The investigators, that will be in contact with patients, will be&#xD;
      blinded at all times to the care group assigned to the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intention to treat analysis The analysis of the subjects participating in the clinical trial&#xD;
      will be performed according to the treatment group to which they were randomized, regardless&#xD;
      of whether they completed the study procedures, adherence to established care or follow-up&#xD;
      time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dependent variable The response variable will be the incidence rate of infections associated&#xD;
      with Mechanical Ventilation (whose denominator will be the observation time in person-days)&#xD;
      developed during the period of the permanence of endotracheal intubation and up to 48 hours&#xD;
      after withdrawal (or death). of the patient).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The IAVM that will be searched intentionally are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pneumonia Associated with Mechanical Ventilation&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Bronchitis or bronchitis trachea&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Laryngitis&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Bacterial pharyngitis&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Acute sinusitis&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mouth-rinse procedure During the active phase: Every 12 hours, approximately, the oral&#xD;
      antiseptic decontamination of the study subjects will be carried out, at the time in which&#xD;
      secretions will be aspirated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to the recommendations of the Clorhex-gum® data sheet (see annex 1) and the&#xD;
      recommendations for oral hygiene in intubated patients, the procedure to be implemented will&#xD;
      be as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Hand washing and non-sterile gloves footwear.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Exam of the pneumotrop pressure, minimizing the possibility of micro aspirations during&#xD;
           the procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Removal the may or bite tube, if applicable.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Hand washing and sterile globes footwear&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Aspiration endotracheal and oropharyngeal secretions.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Application of approximately 15 shots to cover teeth, mucous membranes and tongue.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Tooth brushing (Using the brush that will be delivered at randomization) to remove the&#xD;
           interdental bacterial plaque.&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. After 2 to 3 minutes, aspiration of the remnants of the rinse with a sterile atraumatic&#xD;
           probe to gently aspirate&#xD;
&#xD;
        9. Removal the endotracheal tube holder.&#xD;
&#xD;
       10. Dried up lips and the surrounding area, while checking out the condition of the corners&#xD;
           of the mouth and mucous membranes.&#xD;
&#xD;
       11. Change the position of the endotracheal tube (holding it with a clean fixation)&#xD;
&#xD;
       12. Application of lip protection&#xD;
&#xD;
       13. Placement the may tube or bite, if necessary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dental plaque cultures&#xD;
&#xD;
      As part of the study procedures, 2 dental plaque cultures are contemplated during the course&#xD;
      of the study, which will be carried out by trained clinical staff, following the following&#xD;
      recommendations:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  They must be performed under conditions of maximum asepsis, avoiding environmental&#xD;
           contamination, medical personnel and the patient himself.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The sample should not be in contact with disinfectant substances, so it must be done&#xD;
           before oral hygiene.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The request handout and sample identification must follow the characteristics requested&#xD;
           by the hospital laboratory.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The sample will be taken with the use of curettes and swabs of the dental plaque, trying&#xD;
           to cover in the margin of the gum, both in the upper and lower jaw.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The sample will be stored at room temperature and analyzed with the standard procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistic analysis A descriptive statistical analysis will be carried out to detail the&#xD;
      sociodemographic and clinical characteristics of the subjects belonging to both oral care&#xD;
      groups. The proportions of the variables of both groups will be compared using chi-square&#xD;
      tests, while the differences in the means will be evaluated through the Student's T-test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The cumulative incidence of infections associated with mechanical ventilation and pneumonia&#xD;
      associated with mechanical ventilation, between both care groups will be determined and a&#xD;
      comparative analysis will be carried out between the different types of infections developed&#xD;
      during the period of the permanence of endotracheal intubation and up to 48 hours after&#xD;
      withdrawal or until the patient's death. The numerator will be the total of each type of IAVM&#xD;
      diagnosed and the denominator will be the sum of individual observation times. The Relative&#xD;
      Risk will be calculated from the Incidence Rates and the Population Preventable Fraction for&#xD;
      each type of IAVM analyzed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Kaplan-Meyer estimator will be used to compare the cumulative curves of days in ICU free&#xD;
      of infections associated with mechanical ventilation between care groups with 0.12%&#xD;
      chlorhexidine mouthwash and isotonic bicarbonate solution. The potential weights assumed by&#xD;
      each oral care group will be compared using the Log Rank test against the incidence rate of&#xD;
      infections associated with MV.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As a multivariate analysis, a Poisson regression model will be carried out to determine the&#xD;
      effect of 0.12% chlorhexidine mouthwash on the development of IAVM, compared to mouthwash&#xD;
      with bicarbonate isotonic solution, in adults hospitalized in intensive care that require&#xD;
      mechanical ventilation. adjusting for confusing variables.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To analyze the changes in the dental plaque of the subjects of the two care groups reported&#xD;
      in the 3 cultures performed (on day 0, at 24-48hrs and in extubation), a fixed-effects model&#xD;
      of analysis of variance For all analyzes a 95% confidence interval and a significance level&#xD;
      of p &lt;0.05 will be considered. The analysis will be carried out in the statistical package&#xD;
      STATA 14.0 (Stata Corp, Texas, USA).&#xD;
