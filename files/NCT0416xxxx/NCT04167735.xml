  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Participants will complete a listening task in a simulated reverberant environment.&#xD;
      Participants are seated and instructed to look at a fixation cross while a sentence is&#xD;
      played. Sentences are varied with respect to their speech rate. While listening to the&#xD;
      sentences participant's pupil dilation is measured by means of pupillometry which is a&#xD;
      non-invasive physiological measurement. Participants are asked to repeat back the sentences&#xD;
      loud. At fixed intervals, subjective ratings are collected by asking participants to move an&#xD;
      on-screen slider using a game controller. Two hearing aid programs will be compared, one&#xD;
      intended for speech perception in quiet and the other to reduce reverberation in reverberant&#xD;
      environments. The study is designed as factorial, with 2 speech rates, 2 room simulations and&#xD;
      2 hearing aid programs. The same conditions will be re-tested once after a minimum of one&#xD;
      day. A pilot study will determine appropriate speech rates by applying a different factorial,&#xD;
      with 4 speech rates, 2 room simulations and 1 hearing aid program. Participants complete all&#xD;
      conditions (within-subjects) in one experimental sessions that lasts around 1 hour.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in Event-related-pupil-dilations (ERPDs)</measure>
    <time_frame>4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Pupil dilations will be recorded from the participant during the performance of the auditory tasks. Analyses will be carried out relative to the pre-trial baseline (measured one second prior to the onset of the stimulus), in order to account for differences in baseline physiological activity. It is planned to analyze event-related-pupil-dilations.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Oldenburg sentence test</measure>
    <time_frame>4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>1. Words recalled correctly: words repeated back by participants are logged and the percentage of words recalled correctly calculated.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>subjective rating</measure>
    <time_frame>4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Subjective ratings: using a game controller, participants rate the difficulty of the sentences and listening effort on a visual analog scale. The scale is continuous and ranges from minimal to maximal difficulty/effort. The position of the cursor on the scale is then used to calculate a percentage from 0-100% difficulty/effort.</description>

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Non-verbal Trail Making Test A &amp; B</measure>
    <time_frame>1 week</time_frame>
    <description>The Trail Making Test is a neuropsychological test of visual attention and task switching. It consists of two parts in which the subject is instructed to connect a set of 25 dots as quickly as possible while still maintaining accuracy. The data, serving as an outcome measure, are time-to-complete the set in seconds</description>

    <description>Each participant will be fitted with the 2 different Sound Changing principles on the same hearing aid, saved to 2 manual programs (ensures exact same hearing loss compensation for each intervention). Reverberation Canceller principle is a sound processing algorithm to remove reverberation from a speech signal to improve the speech intelligibility and comfort. The active comparator condition is without Reverberation Canceller principle enabled.</description>

Reverberation Canceller principle is a sound processing algorithm to remove reverberation from a speech signal to improve the speech intelligibility and comfort. The experimental condition applies the Reverberation Canceller and is predicted to provide a benefit in reverberant room simulations.</description>
