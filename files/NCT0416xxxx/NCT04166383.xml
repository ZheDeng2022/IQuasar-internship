      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Gastrointestinal cancer is one of the most common cancers worldwide. Researchers think an&#xD;
      unmet need exists to understand and improve treatment options. They want to see if a&#xD;
      combination of drugs can help people with metastatic colorectal cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To see if using a combination of VB-111 and nivolumab is safe and will cause colorectal&#xD;
      tumors to shrink.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      People ages 18 and older with microsatellite stable colorectal cancer that has spread to the&#xD;
      liver&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants must consent to sample collection protocol 11C0112.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be screened with:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood tests&#xD;
&#xD;
      Scans&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tumor samples. If these are not available, participants will have a biopsy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before they start treatment and with every treatment cycle, participants will have:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physical exams&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood tests&#xD;
&#xD;
      Heart tests&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before they start treatment and every 4 cycles, participants will have CT or MRI scans. For&#xD;
      these, they will lie in a machine that takes pictures of the body. For the MRI, a soft&#xD;
      padding or coil will be placed around their head.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have biopsies before they start therapy. They will have them again after 2&#xD;
      6 weeks on study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On day 1 of 14-day cycles, participants will get one or both study drugs by vein.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After they finish treatment, participants will have monthly visits for 3 months. They will&#xD;
      have a physical exam and blood tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If participants stop treatment for reasons other than their disease getting worse, they will&#xD;
      have scans about every 8 weeks. This will continue until their disease gets worse.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be contacted by phone or email every 6 months. This will continue for life.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Immune based approaches in GI cancers have unfortunately- with the notable exception of&#xD;
           immune checkpoint inhibition in microsatellite instable (MSI-H) disease and gastric&#xD;
           cancer-been largely unsuccessful. The reasons for this are unclear but no doubt relate&#xD;
           to the fact that in advanced disease GI cancer appears to be less immunogenic, as&#xD;
           evidenced by the lack of infiltrating lymphocytes with advancing T stage as well as an&#xD;
           immunosuppressive tumor micro environment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  VB-111 is an anti-angiogenic agent comprising of a nonreplicating E1 deleted adenovirus&#xD;
           type 5 which contains a modified murine preproendothelin (PPE) promoter and Fas-chimera&#xD;
           transgene&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  VB-111 has been tested and shows promise in glioblastoma, ovarian and thyroid tumors&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Nivolumab is a human monoclonal antibody directed against PD-1.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The aim of this study is to study the effects of VB-111 in colorectal cancer (CRC) and&#xD;
           to evaluate whether the antitumor immunity induced by VB-111 therapy can be enhanced by&#xD;
           PD-1 inhibition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the safety and tolerability of VB-111 in combination with nivolumab in&#xD;
           patients with refractory, metastatic CRC&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine Best Overall Response (BOR) (partial response (PR) + complete response&#xD;
           (CR)) according to Response Evaluation Criteria (RECIST v1.1) of combined treatment of&#xD;
           VB-111 and nivolumab in patients with refractory, metastatic CRC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Histopathological confirmation of colorectal cancer metastatic to the liver&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients must have progressed on &gt; 2 lines of standard of care chemotherapy for&#xD;
           colorectal cancer or been intolerant of chemotherapy or refused prior chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients tumors must be documented to be microsatellite stable (MSS).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients must have at least 1 focus of metastatic disease that is amenable to pre-and&#xD;
           on-treatment biopsies and be willing to undergo this.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  All patients enrolled will be required to have measurable disease by RECIST v 1.1&#xD;
           criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The proposed study is a phase II study of VB-111 in combination with immune checkpoint&#xD;
           inhibition (nivolumab) in patients with metastatic CRC&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Treatment will be delivered in cycles consisting of 2 weeks with VB-111 given every 6&#xD;
           weeks and nivolumab given every 2-week until progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Disease status evaluation will be done every 8 (+/- 1) weeks after the start of study&#xD;
           therapy.&#xD;

             investigational agents (e.g. chemotherapy, immunotherapy, endocrine therapy, targeted&#xD;
             therapy, biologic therapy, tumor embolization, monoclonal antibodies or other&#xD;

             often develop progressive neurologic dysfunction that would confound the evaluation of&#xD;
             neurologic and other adverse events.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with signs of liver failure, e.g. clinically significant ascites,&#xD;

             enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  HIV-positive patients are excluded because HIV causes complicated immune deficiency&#xD;
             and study treatment can possess more risks for these patients.&#xD;

          -  Prior invasive malignancy (except non-melanomatous skin cancer) unless disease free&#xD;
             for a minimum of 3 years prior to enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because nivolumab and VB-111 potential for&#xD;
             teratogenic or abortifacient effects are unknown. Because there is an unknown but&#xD;
             potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the&#xD;
             mother with nivolumab and VB-111, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother&#xD;
             is treated with nivolumab and/or and VB-111.&#xD;
