  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single arm, open-label study to evaluate the safety, tolerance and efficacy of CD20&#xD;
      CAR-T Cells in patients with relapsed and refractory B cell non-Hodgkin Lymphoma. Subjects&#xD;
      receive a single intravenous infusion of CD20-CART cells per treatment course.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The maximum dose was determined according to the dose escalation test. Based on the number of&#xD;
      CART cells per kg body weight which was proved to be safe and effective, all the subjects&#xD;
      were treated with one single dose of CD20 CART cells per treatment course. The dose&#xD;
      escalation test was designed to evaluate the four dose levels of CD20-CART (1 × 10 ^ 6&#xD;
      cells/kg,2 × 10 ^ 6 cells/kg,4 × 10 ^ 6 cells/kg,8 × 10 ^ 6 cells/kg). Each CD20-CART&#xD;
      infusion will be carried out on day 0. Each subject was observed for at least 4 weeks after&#xD;
      the last infusion. If there was no dose-limited toxicity (DLT), it is necessary to continue&#xD;
      multiple treatment courses at this dose level. The detailed administration time and dose were&#xD;
      decided by the researchers. The observation period was 4 weeks after the end of the course of&#xD;
      treatment. If 2 or more cases of DLT occurred at a certain dose level, the prior dose level&#xD;
      was the maximum tolerable dose of (MTD). If one case of DLT occurred, 3 subjects were added&#xD;
      to the group. If there were no DLT in 3 cases, the next dose level would be estimated. If at&#xD;
      least 1 case of DLT occurred in the 3 cases, the prior dose was the maximum tolerated dose of&#xD;
      (MTD). If there were no DLT at the maximum dose, the maximum tolerant dose was the maximum&#xD;
      dose.&#xD;
