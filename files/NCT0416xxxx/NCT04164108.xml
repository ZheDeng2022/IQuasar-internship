      Specific Aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1: Evaluate the feasibility of intermittent feeding in intensive care unit patients who&#xD;
      are mechanically ventilated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2: Evaluate the safety and patient tolerance of intermittent feeding in intensive care&#xD;
      unit patients who are mechanically ventilated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 3: Determine efficacy of intermittent feeding in provision of required nutrition in&#xD;
      mechanically ventilated intensive care unit patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 4: Determine association of intermittent enteral feeding with glycemic control in&#xD;
      mechanically ventilated intensive care unit patients.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      With the advent of the feeding pump, default enteral nutrition schedules in many medical&#xD;
      intensive care units has shifted from intermittent or bolus feeding to continuous feeds.&#xD;
      Clinical studies suggest that each of these strategies of providing nutrition is safe for&#xD;
      patients with no significant difference in glycemic control or adverse effects. There is also&#xD;
      data to suggest that approximating a more physiologic nutrition schedule with periods of&#xD;
      feeding and periods of fasting may optimize gastrointestinal and metabolic hormonal feedback&#xD;
      loops thereby effecting outcomes such as gastrointestinal motility, protein synthesis, and&#xD;
      glycemic control, among others. Circadian rhythm research supports a temporally restricted&#xD;
      period of feeding as well. Furthermore, periods of scheduled fasting will allow for provision&#xD;
      of care that is incompatible with enteral feeds, without interrupting administration of&#xD;
      nutrition (for example, procedures or testing, incompatible medications, etc).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aims 1 and 2 will clarify whether an intermittent enteral nutrition schedule is acceptable to&#xD;
      ICU staff and patients. Aims 3 and 4 will test whether this enteral feeding schedule is&#xD;
      effective in providing patients with required nutrition and acceptable glycemic control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This pilot will set the stage for a randomized controlled trial further investigating&#xD;
      superiority of intermittent feeding as compared with the current standard of continuous&#xD;
      feeding.&#xD;
