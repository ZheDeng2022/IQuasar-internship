  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the effects of progressive relaxation exercises on artralgia, quality of&#xD;
      life and anxiety-deppression in breast cancer patients receiving aromatase inhibitor. Half of&#xD;
      the participants will receive supervised progressive relaxing exercises, while other half&#xD;
      will not receive any exercise but only advice about relaxing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: Progressive relaxation exercises improve the pain, quality of life and emotional&#xD;
      status in breast cancer patients receiving aromatase inhibitor therapy.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Aromatase inhibitors (AI) can cause musculoskeletal problems and increased risk of fracture&#xD;
      as side effects in breast cancer (BC) survivors. In particular, arthralgia can be observed in&#xD;
      almost 50% of patients receiving AI. Moreover; cognitive dysfunctions , decreases in quality&#xD;
      of life , anxiety and depression , sleep problems and fatigue can be seen in some of patients&#xD;
      receiving AI. According to these possible side effects, evaluation and treatment of such&#xD;
      health profiles, pain and symptoms is important in terms of improving the quality of life of&#xD;
      the patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Progressive muscle relaxation exercises (PRE) were first described by Jacobson in 1938. PRE&#xD;
      are in use today with different arrangements and updates. It was well defined physiological,&#xD;
      perceptual and behavioral positive findings of muscle relaxation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PRE was thought to be effective on artralgia, quality of life and anxiety-depression in BC&#xD;
      survivors receiving AI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients have been searched from the medical records of brest health center in a local&#xD;
      hospital. Necessary permissions to use this data was provided from medical coordinator of the&#xD;
      hospital and from the coordinator of Breast Health Center.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study was conducted as two armed, assessor blinded and randomised controlled trial. BC&#xD;
      survivors who are receiving AI were randomised to study (performed PRE) or control (no&#xD;
      intervention) group. Eligible patients were provided information about the the study and&#xD;
      invited to participate in study via phone call. All assessments and exercise training was&#xD;
      carried out in Physiotherapy Department of the same hospital. Outcomes were assessed baseline&#xD;
      and at 6th-week intervention Primary endpoint was pain assessment assessed by Brief Pain&#xD;
      inventory. Secondary endpoints were quality of life assessed by Functional Assessment of&#xD;
      Chronic Illness Therapy and emotional status by Hospital Anxiety and Depression scales.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis Sample size was calculated by using a previous study mentioned the&#xD;
      impact of yoga on functional outcomes in breast cancer survivors with aromatase&#xD;
      inhibitor-associated arthralgias. The mean and standart deviation data of the FACT-B&#xD;
      parameter was used with the power (1-type II error) of 0.80 and a type I error of 0.05.&#xD;
      Therefore, it was aimed to recruit at least 20 participants per group. In total, with dropout&#xD;
      rate of 30%, it was estimated to recruit 26 patients in each group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mean [95% confidence intervals (CI)], standard deviations and frequency rates was analyzed&#xD;
      for baseline charecteristics. Group distributions were examined with the Kolmogorov Simirnov&#xD;
      test. Groups analysis were performed using the non parametric test methods due to the low&#xD;
      number of participants. Mann-Whitney U test for the analysis of quantitative independent&#xD;
      data, and Wilcoxon test was used for the analysis of dependent data. Mc-Nemar Test was used&#xD;
      for dependent variables and Chi-Square test was used for independent variables in the&#xD;
      analysis of qualitative data. Cohen's Formula used for calculating efect size of differences&#xD;
      between and within the groups. Figures are performed by the SPSS graphics. P value &lt;0.05 was&#xD;
      considered as significant.&#xD;

    <description>Evaluates the multidimensionel quality of life in patients with breast cancer and is available in many languages . The questionnaire includes 5 sub-scales that assess physical, social, emotional, functional and other anxiety status. It has 27-item general and 10-item breast cancer specific scale in which patients evaluate their status. Patients determine an appropriate expression for themselves in the last 7 days, with a 5 point scale as 0: none, 1: very little, 2: slightly, 3: quite, 4: too much. Higher scores indicate higher quality of life</description>
