      Osteogenesis Imperfecta (OI) is a genetic disorder caused by mutations to the alpha-1 or&#xD;
      alpha-2 chain of type I collagen. Clinically, the disorder is characterized by bones that&#xD;
      fracture easily, often from little or no apparent trauma. There is no information about Some&#xD;
      institutions perform blood pressure monitoring on these patients with a cuff, while other&#xD;
      institutions avoid this method due to concern for fracture. Instead, they use alternative&#xD;
      forms of monitoring such as an arterial line. These methods come with their own risks,&#xD;
      including clotting, decreased perfusion, and pain. In addition, arterial lines require&#xD;
      intensive (and more expensive) monitoring in a pediatric intensive care unit due to risk of&#xD;
      dislodgement and rapid blood loss. These blood pressure monitoring recommendations for&#xD;
      patients with OI do not appear to be based on strong evidence. Anecdotally, some patients and&#xD;
      healthcare professionals report hearing about individuals with OI who have suffered fractures&#xD;
      from blood pressure cuffs. However, this is not well documented in the medical literature.&#xD;
      Regular and accurate blood pressure monitoring is particularly important in the postoperative&#xD;
      period, due to blood loss and fluid shifts, as well as utilization of advanced pain&#xD;
      management techniques that can potentially impact blood pressure.&#xD;

      Introduction Osteogenesis Imperfecta (OI) is a genetic disorder caused by mutations to the&#xD;
      alpha-1 or alpha-2 chain of type I collagen. There are eight forms of OI, ranging from type I&#xD;
      through VIII, however in types V to VIII the symptoms and severity fall within the range of&#xD;
      the first four types. Clinically, the disorder is characterized by bones that fracture&#xD;
      easily, often from little or no apparent trauma. These patients require special care and&#xD;
      handling to minimize risk of fracture, and often undergo multiple surgeries to stabilize&#xD;
      fractures and prevent or correct bone deformities. However, specific guidelines and&#xD;
      restrictions for care, including clinical and postoperative care, vary between patients and&#xD;
      among institutions. Some institutions perform blood pressure monitoring with a&#xD;
      circumferential cuff, while other institutions avoid this method due to concern for&#xD;
      iatrogenic fracture. Instead, they utilize alternative forms of monitoring such as an&#xD;
      arterial line. Currently at Nemours, children and adults with OI have arterial lines placed&#xD;
      in the OR for the purpose of BP monitoring. These more invasive methods come with their own&#xD;
      risks, including thrombosis, decreased perfusion, and pain. In addition, arterial lines&#xD;
      require intensive (and more expensive) monitoring in a pediatric intensive care unit due to&#xD;
      risk of dislodgement and rapid blood loss. These blood pressure monitoring recommendations&#xD;
      for patients with OI do not appear to be based on strong evidence. Anecdotally, some patients&#xD;
      and healthcare professionals report hearing about individuals with OI who have suffered&#xD;
      fractures from blood pressure cuffs. However, this is not well supported in the literature.&#xD;
      Regular and accurate blood pressure monitoring is particularly important in the postoperative&#xD;
      period, due to blood loss and fluid shifts, as well as utilization of advanced pain&#xD;
      management techniques that can potentially impact blood pressure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim of the study: In this observational study, we intend to evaluate the feasibility of&#xD;
      non-invasive cuff blood pressure monitoring in a select group of patients with OI in the&#xD;
      inpatient postoperative period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Materials and Methods Following Nemours IRB approval and consent from the parent or legal&#xD;
      guardian, fifty children with OI scheduled for lower extremity surgery with subsequent&#xD;
      in-hospital admission will be enrolled in the study. Since we performed preformed lower&#xD;
      extremity surgeries on thirty patients in each of the past two years, we anticipate the study&#xD;
      will take two years to complete.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A group of registered nurses would be educated about the study and equipment used, review of&#xD;
      appropriate blood pressure cuff size selection, blood pressure monitoring protocol, signs and&#xD;
      symptoms of adverse events, and steps to take if an adverse event occurred.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients of all ages with OI who are admitted at our institution to the inpatient,&#xD;
           non-ICU setting, in the postoperative period following an orthopedic surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Must be able to tolerate upper extremity blood pressures.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Medical clearance by OI physicians (Kruse, Franzone) after review of fracture history,&#xD;
           surgical procedures, x-rays.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Parent or child refusal, uncooperative child.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  History of frequent upper extremity fracture, recent upper extremity fracture (&lt; 8&#xD;
           weeks, or upper extremity fracture that is not yet completely healed).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Thrombocytopenia, admission or transfer to PICU.&#xD;
