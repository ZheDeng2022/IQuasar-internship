  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Tonsillectomy is one of the most performed procedures in childhood, which carries with it&#xD;
      certain postoperative problems, such as the pain of the operated area. Sickness greatly&#xD;
      impairs the quality of life in the postoperative period and further reduces food and fluid&#xD;
      intake in children, which in turn causes prolonged recovery after surgery. The impact of&#xD;
      cooling oropharynx in the form of ice cream consumption as a form of cryotherapy could help&#xD;
      reduce the pain, reduce the use of oral analgesic therapy and help in faster recovery after&#xD;
      surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research goal:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the study is to determine whether the consumption of ice cream, as a form of&#xD;
      cryotherapy, influences the rate of postoperative recovery after tonsillectomy and the&#xD;
      consumption of oral analgesics in children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study was designed as a prospective, randomized, parallel-group, unmasked, and&#xD;
      longitudinal study enroling 100 children undergoing tonsillectomy in a tertiary referral&#xD;
      center. Of those children, 60 will consume the same ice cream (a combination of vanilla and&#xD;
      chocolate as universally acceptable flavors) twice daily, morning and evening, for two weeks&#xD;
      after surgery. 40 children will not consume ice cream during the stated period. Parents will&#xD;
      be given a questionnaire with a validated VAS Wong-Baker FACES scale (Visual - Analogue -&#xD;
      Scale) used by the Zagreb Pediatric Disease Clinic to be completed at home based on&#xD;
      communication with the child and containing information on a visual-analogue subjective pain&#xD;
      experience in children every morning after eating ice cream and the amount of analgesics the&#xD;
      children received during the first two weeks after surgery. There will also be a record of&#xD;
      the days when children began to consume food and drink in the same range and quality as&#xD;
      before surgery.&#xD;

      Tonsillectomy is one of the most performed procedures in childhood, which carries with it&#xD;
      certain postoperative problems, such as the pain of the operated area. Sickness greatly&#xD;
      impairs the quality of life in the postoperative period and further reduces food and fluid&#xD;
      intake in children, which in turn causes prolonged recovery after surgery. The impact of&#xD;
      cooling oropharynx in the form of ice cream consumption as a form of cryotherapy could help&#xD;
      reduce the pain, reduce the use of oral analgesic therapy and help in faster recovery after&#xD;
      surgery. Also, this research represents the first recorded attempt in the literature to test&#xD;
      the myth of the association between tonsillectomy and ice cream in children in a prospective&#xD;
      nonrandomized study with parallel intervention groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research goal:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the study is to determine whether the consumption of ice cream, as a form of&#xD;
      cryotherapy, influences the rate of postoperative recovery after tonsillectomy and the&#xD;
      consumption of oral analgesics in children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research participants:&#xD;
&#xD;
      100 children undergoing tonsillectomy at the Clinic for Otorhinolaryngology and Head and Neck&#xD;
      Surgery at the Clinical Hospital Center &quot;Sisters of Mercy&quot; The study was designed as a&#xD;
      prospective, randomized, parallel-group, unmasked, and longitudinal study enrolling 100&#xD;
      children undergoing tonsillectomy. Of those children, 60 will consume the same ice cream (a&#xD;
      combination of vanilla and chocolate as universally acceptable flavors) twice daily, morning&#xD;
      and evening, for two weeks after surgery. 40 children will not consume ice cream during the&#xD;
      stated period. Parents will be given a questionnaire with a validated VAS Wong-Baker FACES&#xD;
      scale (Visual - Analogue - Scale) used by the Zagreb Pediatric Disease Clinic to be completed&#xD;
      at home based on communication with the child and containing information on a visual-analogue&#xD;
      subjective pain experience in children every morning after eating ice cream and the amount of&#xD;
      analgesics the children received during the first two weeks after surgery. There will also be&#xD;
      a record of the days when children began to consume food and drink in the same range and&#xD;
      quality as before surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be conducted on children who have tonsillectomy at the Clinic for&#xD;
      Otorhinolaryngology and Head and Neck Surgery in the period 12/1/2019 - 6/30/2020, and will&#xD;
      include a total of 100 children. Parents will also participate in the research and data&#xD;
      collection, in addition to the Clinic doctors involved in this research.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A random coin toss (binary coin-toss method) will determine which child enters the group of&#xD;
      children who consume ice cream and which does not.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will be collected prospectively at each regular check-up after surgery. The data sought&#xD;
      is a subjective feeling of pain, consumption of analgesics in milligrams depending on the&#xD;
      type of analgesics, and the postoperative day when the diet returned to normal, preoperative&#xD;
      conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are no risks of participating in the research.&#xD;
