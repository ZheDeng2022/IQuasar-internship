    <textblock>
      This study intends to explore the effect of dynamic compliance guided individualized positive&#xD;
      end-expiratory pressure titration strategy on reducing the level of postoperative atelectasis&#xD;
      in obese patient who have laparoscopic bariatric surgery.The results of the study are to&#xD;
      assess the effects of this intervention on the incidence，duration of postoperative&#xD;
      atelectasis and other complications including hypoxemia etc. after laparoscopic bariatric&#xD;
      surgery.And reducing the burden of postoperative atelectasis on patients and their families,&#xD;
      hospitals and public resources.&#xD;

Recruitment maneuver: Pressure-controlled ventilation mode increasing PEEP from 10 to 25cmH2O.&#xD;
PEEP-titration maneuver: At this PEEP level, a decremental PEEP-titration maneuver will be started in volume-controlled ventilation mode, decreasing PEEP to 5cmH2O to confirm the highest dynamic lung compliance.&#xD;
After titration: A new recruitment maneuver will be performed and the final PEEP will be the one related to the highest dynamic lung compliance plus 2cm H2O.&#xD;
Randomization: Subsequently patient was randomized, the PEEP was then maintained (individualized PEEP arm) until extubation.&#xD;
After discharged from post-anesthesia care unit (60 to 90 minutes after extubation)：A chest computerized tomography（CT） will be performed to assess the amount of atelectasis, expressed as the percentage of lung tissue in CT.</description>

    <description>Basic ventilation: Volume-controlled ventilation (VCV) mode with positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 8cm H2O after induction of anesthesia，&#xD;
Recruitment maneuver (RM): Pressure-controlled ventilation (PCV) mode increasing PEEP from 10 to 25cmH2O in step of 5cmH2O per 30s.&#xD;
PEEP-titration maneuver: ventilation parameters reset as basic ventilation with PEEP still 25cmH2O.Decrease PEEP to 5cmH2O in step of 2cmH2O per 10 respiratory cycles to confirm the highest dynamic lung compliance (Cdy).&#xD;
After titration: A new RM will be performed and the final PEEP will be the one related to highest Cdy plus 2cm H2O.&#xD;
Randomized after the second RM. Individualized PEEP arm: maintain individualized PEEP; PEEP8 arm: maintain a fixed PEEP of 8cm H2O.&#xD;
VCV with other ventilation parameters the same as basic ventilation until extubation .&#xD;
After discharged from postoperative anesthesia care unit (60 to 90 minutes after extubation): chest CT .</description>
