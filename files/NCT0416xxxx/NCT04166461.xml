  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Obesity is a growing epidemic and bariatric surgery has been shown to be the most effective&#xD;
      and efficient mean of achieving significant and sustainable weight loss in morbidly obese&#xD;
      individuals. Studies have demonstrated that after LSG, between 5 and 30% of patients suffered&#xD;
      from GERD, with a small subset of those patients (2.9 %) converting to another bariatric&#xD;
      procedure (gastric bypass) because of debilitating GERD symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators propose this current study to examine mucosal impedance before and after&#xD;
      sleeve gastrectomy using the novel mucosal impedance procedure, as well as assess quality of&#xD;
      life and GERD symptoms parameters. In addition, this study will determine if the level of&#xD;
      mucosal impedance pre-sleeve gastrectomy may predict the development of GERD post-surgery.&#xD;
      Our Hypothesis is that sleeve gastrectomy is highly associated with the risk of developing&#xD;
      new onset GERD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a prospective, comparative cohort study. A total of 15 obese patients (BMI ≥ 35)&#xD;
      undergoing sleeve gastrectomy by choice will be recruited into the study from our bariatric&#xD;
      and weight management program. An initial screening upper endoscopy will be performed as part&#xD;
      of pre-bariatric evaluation, during which mucosal impedance will be performed with the&#xD;
      consent of the patient. Patients with evidence of erosive esophagitis (LA grade A-D),&#xD;
      Barrett's esophagus or eosinophilic esophagitis will be excluded from the study. As per&#xD;
      surgical recommendation, PPI will be used for 6 months in all bariatric patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Six months post-surgery, study patients will be re-evaluated by the GERD symptoms Checklist&#xD;
      and SF 36. In addition, their new BMI will be documented. PPI will be held for at least 1&#xD;
      week and a 6 months post-surgical upper endoscopy will be performed to determine the presence&#xD;
      or absence of erosive esophagitis and Barrett's esophagus. In addition, esophageal mucosal&#xD;
      impedance will be reassessed.&#xD;

      Rationale/Significance:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Obesity is a growing epidemic problem around the world. World Health Organization (WHO)&#xD;
      defines obesity as a body mass index (BMI) over 30 Kg/m2 and it is estimated that 10% of the&#xD;
      world's population is obese. Associated with obesity are health conditions that carry&#xD;
      significant morbidity and mortality, including cardiovascular disease, osteoarthritis,&#xD;
      diabetes, cancer (breast, colon and endometrial) and gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD).&#xD;
      Bariatric surgery has been shown to be the most effective and efficient mean of achieving&#xD;
      significant and sustainable weight loss in morbidly obese individuals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As part of their limited GI workup, candidates for bariatric surgery usually undergo only an&#xD;
      upper endoscopy prior to surgery. However, no studies are preferred to assess the degree of&#xD;
      esophageal acid exposure in patients with normal endoscopy who are candidates for LSG. In&#xD;
      addition, there is no routine assessment of patients post LSG for the development of GERD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The effect of laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) on GERD has been equivocal with&#xD;
      low-quality evidence suggesting both improvement and worsening of reflux after surgery.&#xD;
      Studies have demonstrated that after LSG, between 5 and 30% of patients suffered from GERD,&#xD;
      with a small subset of those patients (2.9 %) converting to another bariatric procedure&#xD;
      (gastric bypass) because of debilitating GERD symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As part of their limited GI workup, candidates for bariatric surgery usually undergo only an&#xD;
      upper endoscopy prior to surgery. Currently there is no routine formal (endoscopic or pH)&#xD;
      assessment of patients after gastric weight loss surgery for the development of GERD. The&#xD;
      effect of laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) on GERD has been equivocal with low-quality&#xD;
      evidence from various studies suggesting both improvement and worsening of reflux after&#xD;
      surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main purpose of this study is to evaluate whether GERD develops after LSG and to examine&#xD;
      the esophagus after LSG for the possible development of acid reflux both endoscopically&#xD;
      (visible by camera view) and on a cellular level by obtaining mucosal impedance. Mucosal&#xD;
      impedance (MI) is a measurement that can evaluate if the structure of the esophageal tissue&#xD;
      is normal or abnormal. MI is performed using an FDA approved endoscopic tool called &quot;Mucosal&#xD;
      Integrity Conductivity Test System&quot; (Diversatek). The MI system software uses the collected&#xD;
      data to determine if there is evidence of GERD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators propose this current study to examine mucosal impedance before and after&#xD;
      sleeve gastrectomy using the novel mucosal impedance procedure, as well as assess quality of&#xD;
      life and GERD symptoms parameters. In addition, this study will determine if the level of&#xD;
      mucosal impedance pre-sleeve gastrectomy may predict the development of GERD post-surgery.&#xD;
      Our Hypothesis is that sleeve gastrectomy is highly associated with the risk of developing&#xD;
      new onset GERD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a prospective, comparative cohort study. A total of 15 obese patients (BMI ≥ 35)&#xD;
      undergoing sleeve gastrectomy by choice will be recruited into the study from our bariatric&#xD;
      and weight management program. An initial screening upper endoscopy will be performed as part&#xD;
      of pre-bariatric evaluation, during which mucosal impedance will be performed with the&#xD;
      consent of the patient. Patients with evidence of erosive esophagitis (LA grade A-D),&#xD;
      Barrett's esophagus or eosinophilic esophagitis will be excluded from the study. As per&#xD;
      surgical recommendation, PPI will be used for 6 months in all bariatric patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Six months post-surgery, study patients will be re-evaluated by the GERD symptoms Checklist&#xD;
      and SF 36. In addition, their new BMI will be documented. PPI will be held for at least 1&#xD;
      week and a 6 months post-surgical upper endoscopy will be performed to determine the presence&#xD;
      or absence of erosive esophagitis and Barrett's esophagus. In addition, esophageal mucosal&#xD;
      impedance will be reassessed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary aim&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To determine the development of GERD after sleeve gastrectomy by measuring esophageal&#xD;
      mucosal impedance pre and post-surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary aim&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the degree of GERD development post sleeve gastrectomy&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine any effect on quality of life post-sleeve gastrectomy&#xD;
