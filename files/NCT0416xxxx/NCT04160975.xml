  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to identify what sender/signal combinations are most persuasive in&#xD;
      encouraging low socioeconomic males living in the U.S. to take-up seasonal flu vaccination.&#xD;
      The investigators plan to recruit male subjects and randomly assign them to four persuasion&#xD;
      treatments: three of which vary dimensions of the sender of a medical recommendation (racial&#xD;
      concordance and authority treatments) and one which varies the signal (standard vs.&#xD;
      empathetic). Specifically, the investigators will show subjects videos of either Black or&#xD;
      white actors/actresses providing scripted information on the flu vaccination. The&#xD;
      investigators will randomize the race of the sender and if the subject is Black, also&#xD;
      randomize the authority of the sender, with the actor portraying either a doctor or a&#xD;
      layperson. In addition, the investigators will vary the script used in the experiment between&#xD;
      one that acknowledges past injustices (indicated as an empathetic script hereafter) and one&#xD;
      that does not (indicated as a standard script hereafter). The investigators will provide&#xD;
      subjects a free flu shot coupon and elicit the price at which subjects would be willing to&#xD;
      give up this coupon for a cash reward. Lastly, in light of the relevance of vaccination&#xD;
      take-up in combating COVID-19 pandemic, the investigators will assess demand for information&#xD;
      about a COVID-19 vaccine, with subjects invited to receive results of a safety and efficacy&#xD;
      review from a trusted or standard source. The design requires the collection of baseline and&#xD;
      endline surveys combined with administrative data from pharmacies about coupon redemption.&#xD;
      The primary outcomes of interest are posterior beliefs about seasonal flu vaccination, demand&#xD;
      and willingness-to-pay (WTP) for a free flu shot coupon, redemption of the coupon, and demand&#xD;
      for information about a COVID-19 vaccine.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators will recruit approximately 3350 African-American or Caucasian adult males&#xD;
      with a high-school diploma or less. A pilot study, which ran during the 2019-20 flu season,&#xD;
      recruited approximately 850 subjects, and a planned scale-up will recruit an additional 2500&#xD;
      subjects during the 2020-21 flu season. The investigators will oversample African American&#xD;
      individuals, emphasizing low-income and minority men because these characteristics are&#xD;
      correlated with lower relative take-up of flu vaccination. After informed consent is&#xD;
      obtained, subjects will be asked about sociodemographic information (age, education, income&#xD;
      and marital status), healthcare experience and past medical history, knowledge and beliefs&#xD;
      about flu vaccination, and location of the nearest pharmacy. The investigators will then&#xD;
      randomly assign the adult male subjects to videos which contain one of Black or white actors&#xD;
      playing the role of either a doctor or a layperson as well as different scripts. The content&#xD;
      of the infomercial will be the safety and effectiveness of adult seasonal flu vaccination.&#xD;
      After the video, the investigators will obtain information on beliefs regarding vaccination,&#xD;
      feedback on the video, attention to the video and willingness-to-pay for a flu shot coupon.&#xD;
      The final baseline module will consist of a randomly assigned invitation to receive the&#xD;
      results of an upcoming review of a COVID-19 vaccine, with subjects assigned to receive&#xD;
      information from a trusted or standard source. The investigators will track flu coupon&#xD;
      redemption, which is redeemable at most pharmacies nationwide.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Rating of Sender</measure>
    <time_frame>This outcome was assessed during Baseline survey, which took approximately 20 minutes.</time_frame>
    <description>This is an inverse-covariance-weighted index comprised of responses to survey questions regarding:&#xD;
whether the respondent was interested in further medical advice from the given sender (measured as a binary outcome);&#xD;
whether the respondent trusted advice from the sender measured on a scale of 1 to 5;&#xD;
and whether the respondent's assessment of the sender's qualification to provide medical advice measured on a scale of 1 to 5.&#xD;
It is standardized to a mean of 0 and standard deviation of 1. Scores less than 0 indicate lower ratings of the sender rated by participants in Arm A (described in each arm/group description) compared to the rating rated by participants in Arm B (also described in each arm/group description). Scores greater than 0 indicate higher ratings of the sender by Arm A compared to by Arm B. For example, an index score of .18 indicates that participants in Arm A rate the sender 0.18 index (in standard deviation units) higher than those in Arm B.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Rating of Signal</measure>
    <time_frame>This outcome was assessed during Baseline survey, which took approximately 20 minutes.</time_frame>
    <description>This is an inverse-covariance-weighted index comprised of responses to survey questions on:&#xD;
recommending the video to friends and family measured on a scale of 0 to 10;&#xD;
recommending the flu shot to friends and family measured on a scale of 0 to 10;&#xD;
and the respondent's assessment of the extent to which the information contained in the video was useful measured on a scale of 1 to 5.&#xD;
It is standardized to a mean of 0 and standard deviation of 1. An index score of 0 is equal to the mean. Scores less than 0 indicate lower ratings of the signal rated by participants in Arm A (described in each arm/group description) compared to the rating rated by participants in Arm B (also described in each arm/group description). Scores greater than 0 indicate higher ratings of the signal by Arm A compared to by Arm B. For example, an index score of 0.14 indicates that participants in Arm A rate the signal 0.14 index (in standard deviation units) higher than those in Arm B.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Signal Content Recall</measure>
    <time_frame>This outcome will be assessed during Baseline survey, which takes approximately 20 minutes.</time_frame>
    <description>This is an inverse-covariance-weighted index comprised of responses to survey questions on:&#xD;
whether age group for whom the flu vaccine is recommended (measured as a binary outcome); and&#xD;
whether the flu shot contains the flu virus (recall of information discussed in the video) (measured as a binary outcome).&#xD;
It is standardized to a mean of 0 and standard deviation of 1. An index score of 0 is equal to the mean. Scores less than 0 indicate lower level of recalling signal content among participants in Arm A (described in each arm/group description) compared to the level among participants in Arm B (also described in each arm/group description). Scores greater than 0 indicate a higher level of recalling signal content among participants in Arm A compared to those in Arm B. For example, an index score of 0.02 indicates that participants in Arm A recall signal content 0.02 index (in standard deviation units) higher than those in Arm B.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Safety Beliefs</measure>
    <time_frame>This outcome will be assessed during Baseline survey, which takes approximately 20 minutes.</time_frame>
    <description>This is an inverse-covariance-weighted index comprised of:&#xD;
the point belief on the likelihood to contract the flu from the flu shot measured by a Likert scale and rescaled to have a support of -1 to 1.&#xD;
the certainty measured with a balls and bins method and rescaled to have a support of -1 to 1.&#xD;
It is standardized to a mean of 0 and standard deviation of 1. An index score of 0 is equal to the mean. Scores less than 0 indicate a lower level of beliefs in the safety of flu vaccine among participants in Arm A (described in each arm/group description) compared to the level among participants in Arm B (also described in each arm/group description). Scores greater than 0 indicate a higher level of beliefs among participants in Arm A compared to those in Arm B. For example, an index score of -0.1 indicates that participants in Arm A hold such beliefs 0.1 index (in standard deviation units) lower than those in Arm B.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Coupon Interest</measure>
    <time_frame>This outcome was assessed during Baseline survey, which took approximately 20 minutes.</time_frame>
    <description>This is an inverse-covariance-weighted index comprised of revealed preference measures of demand for a free flu shot coupon:&#xD;
Willingness to pay (WTP) for the coupon measured as $0, $1, $2, $5, or $10&#xD;
demand for information regarding locations to redeem the coupon measured as a binary outcome&#xD;
It is standardized to a mean of 0 and standard deviation of 1. An index score of 0 is equal to the mean. Scores less than 0 indicate a lower level of interest in a free flu shot coupon distributed after survey completion among participants in Arm A (described in each arm/group description) compared to the level among participants in Arm B (also described in each arm/group description). Scores greater than 0 indicate a higher level of interest among participants in Arm A compared to those in Arm B. For example, an index score of -0.01 indicates that participants in Arm A hold such interest -0.01 index (in standard deviation units) higher than those in Arm B.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>(Posterior) Flu Vaccine Intent</measure>
    <time_frame>This outcome was assessed after the video treatment during Baseline survey, which took approximately 20 minutes.</time_frame>
    <description>This is the respondent's likelihood to receive the flu vaccine before the end of the flu season. This was elicited on an 11-point Likert scale (0 extremely unwilling, 10 extremely willing) after the video message treatment. We re-scaled this outcome to have a scale of 0 to 1. The reported results of the outcome compare participants in Arm A and Arm B (described in each arm/group description). For example, an intent of 0.03 indicates that participants in Arm A are 0.03 units on a scale more likely to intent to take up the flu vaccine compared to those in Arm B.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>COVID-19 Vaccine Intent</measure>
    <time_frame>This outcome was assessed after the video treatment during Baseline survey, which took approximately 20 minutes.</time_frame>
    <description>This is the respondent's likelihood to take up the COVID-19 vaccine if made available free of charge. This was elicited on an 11-point Likert scale (0 extremely unwilling, 10 extremely willing) after the video message treatment. We re-scaled this outcome to have a scale of 0 to 1. The reported results of the outcome compare participants in Arm A and Arm B (described in each arm/group description). For example, an intent of 0.04 indicates that participants in Arm A are 0.04 units on a scale more likely to intent to take up the COVID-19 vaccine compared to those in Arm B.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Flu Vaccine Take-up</measure>
    <time_frame>This outcome was assessed during the follow-up survey which was conducted at least two weeks after the initial baseline survey.</time_frame>
    <description>This is respondents' self-report in the follow-up survey on whether they or their family members had received the flu shot or redeemed the coupon since the intervention. The reported results of the outcome compare participants in Arm A and Arm B (described in each arm/group description). For example, 15.0 percentage points indicate that participants in Arm A are more likely to report that they and/or another household member received the flu vaccine by 15.p percentage points compared to those in Arm B.</description>

        <title>Rating of Sender</title>
        <description>This is an inverse-covariance-weighted index comprised of responses to survey questions regarding:&#xD;
whether the respondent was interested in further medical advice from the given sender (measured as a binary outcome);&#xD;
whether the respondent trusted advice from the sender measured on a scale of 1 to 5;&#xD;
and whether the respondent's assessment of the sender's qualification to provide medical advice measured on a scale of 1 to 5.&#xD;
It is standardized to a mean of 0 and standard deviation of 1. Scores less than 0 indicate lower ratings of the sender rated by participants in Arm A (described in each arm/group description) compared to the rating rated by participants in Arm B (also described in each arm/group description). Scores greater than 0 indicate higher ratings of the sender by Arm A compared to by Arm B. For example, an index score of .18 indicates that participants in Arm A rate the sender 0.18 index (in standard deviation units) higher than those in Arm B.</description>

It is standardized to a mean of 0 and standard deviation of 1. An index score of 0 is equal to the mean. Scores less than 0 indicate lower level of recalling signal content among participants in Arm A (described in each arm/group description) compared to the level among participants in Arm B (also described in each arm/group description). Scores greater than 0 indicate a higher level of recalling signal content among participants in Arm A compared to those in Arm B. For example, an index score of 0.02 indicates that participants in Arm A recall signal content 0.02 index (in standard deviation units) higher than those in Arm B.</description>

The reported results of the outcome compare participants in Arm A and Arm B (described in each arm/group description). For example, an intent of 0.03 indicates that participants in Arm A are 0.03 units on a scale more likely to intent to take up the flu vaccine compared to those in Arm B.</description>

          <title>(Posterior) Flu Vaccine Intent</title>
          <description>This is the respondent's likelihood to receive the flu vaccine before the end of the flu season. This was elicited on an 11-point Likert scale (0 extremely unwilling, 10 extremely willing) after the video message treatment. We re-scaled this outcome to have a scale of 0 to 1. The reported results of the outcome compare participants in Arm A and Arm B (described in each arm/group description). For example, an intent of 0.03 indicates that participants in Arm A are 0.03 units on a scale more likely to intent to take up the flu vaccine compared to those in Arm B.</description>
