      Introduction: Adding opioids to local anesthetic solutions leads to enhanced anesthesia and&#xD;
      provide postoperative analgesia. Intrathecaly injected opioids have some side effects,&#xD;
      though. One of them is pruritus. Objective: We designed a randomized, double-blinded,&#xD;
      placebo-controlled study to evaluate prophylactic impact of continuous IV Magnesium 10mg/kg&#xD;
      over 30 minutes on intrathecal fentanyl-induced pruritus start at the end of the operation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: ASA I-II Patient's candidate for orthopedic operations under spinal anesthesia&#xD;
      (10-15mg hyperbaric bupivacaine and 25 µg fentanyl intrathecal) and will be divided randomly&#xD;
      into two groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Control group (Placebo group): bolus 100 ml nacl 0.9% at end of surgery Study group (Mg ++&#xD;
      group): (continuous IV Magnesium 10mg/kg in 100 ml Nacl0.9% over 30 minutes at end of&#xD;
      surgery).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study outcome:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Hemodynamics: Systolic blood pressure, Mean arterial blood pressure, pulse rate, O2&#xD;
           saturation will be recorded in 5 min,10 min,30 min,60 min and every one hour till 6&#xD;
           hours after the operation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Pruritus Patients were asked about existence (present=1,no=0), severity (mild=1,&#xD;
           modret=2, sever =3) and site of pruritus (Face(trigeminal) =1, neuroaxial(dermatome)=2),&#xD;
           1,2,4, and 6 hours after operation. Incidence of pruritus total group incidence %.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. The incidence of PONV.&#xD;

      Study hypothesis Intravenous Magnesium would reduce and improve post-spinal fentanyl pruritus&#xD;
      incidence outcome relaying up on the fact that Magnesium ions block the neuroaxial NMDA&#xD;
      receptor which are involved in histamine-induced expansion of mechanical receptive field&#xD;
      area, a neural event possibly involved in the development of pruritis. (36) Aim of the work&#xD;
      To introduce Magnesium sulphate as cheap effective alternative for prevention and management&#xD;
      of post-spinal opioid pruritis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods This prospective randomized double blinded controlled study will be carried out in&#xD;
      Mansoura faculty of medicine in Mansoura University hospital on cases subjected to LL&#xD;
      orthopedic operations under spinal anesthesia utilizing bupivacaine plus adjuvant fentanyl&#xD;
      which is documented to have high incidence of postspinal pruritus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients: ASA I-II, of both genders, aged 20-70 years old Patient's candidate for LL&#xD;
      orthopedic operations under spinal anesthesia. Total patient number of 144, will be enrolled&#xD;
      into two groups 72 patients each, all patients will be anesthetized intrathecaly using10-15mg&#xD;
      hyperbaric bupivacaine and 30 µg fentanyl and will be subdivided randomly into two groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Control group (Placebo Group): bolus 50 ml Nacl 0.9% at the end of surgery over 20 minutes&#xD;
      5ml/minute infusion rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study group (MG++ Group): continuous IV infusion pump of Magnesium 10mg/kg in 50 ml Nacl0.9%&#xD;
      over 20 minutes at end of surgery 5ml/minute infusion rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization and blindness; the study drugs were prepared in 50 ml saline syringe according&#xD;
      to the study randomization envelop method by an anesthesiologist who did not participate in&#xD;
      the care and evaluation of the patients. The investigator and the patients were not aware of&#xD;
      the drug they received.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study outcomes (were assessed by the same clinician who cared for the patients in the&#xD;
      perioperative and postoperative periods.)&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Demographic data Age weight, length, BMI, operative type and operative time.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Hemodynamics:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Systolic blood pressure, mean arterial blood pressure, heart rate, O2 saturation will be&#xD;
           recorded basal, 10 min, 30 min, 60 min and every one hour till 6 hours after operation&#xD;
           then every 6 h for the 1st 12 h after surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Pruritus Primary outcome =Incidence of pruritus in each group incidence %. Includes 3&#xD;
           items 1. Existence (present=1, no=0), 2. Severity (mild=1, modret=2, sever =3) 3. Site&#xD;
           of pruritus (Face (trigeminal) =1, neuraxial (dermatome) =2) during the 1st 6 hours&#xD;
           after spinal fentanyl injection.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. PO 1st 24 h Magnesium dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. PO 1st 24 h Naloxone.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. The incidence of PO vomiting% in each group. -Exclusion Criteria: BMI&gt;35, Patient&#xD;

           naloxone in 100ml normal saline iv infusion over the next 1hour during the postoperative&#xD;
           12 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Moderate Abdominal Pain: VAS &gt;4 during surgical manipulation is unaccepted and managed&#xD;
           soon using multimodal analgesia regimen including; ketorolac slow injection in an IV&#xD;
           bolus of 0.5mg/kg if general anesthesia needed to control pain case will be excluded&#xD;

           using ephedrine bolus doses of 6mg, fluids and blood transfusion according to events and&#xD;
           requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Bradycardia (HR less than 60 b/m.) will be managed by atropine bolus of 0.5 mg.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Desaturation (SaO2&lt; 90%) will be managed by increase oxygen face mask flow up to 10&#xD;
           L/sec. and dealing with the airway according to the situation targeting a patient airway&#xD;
           with breathing comfort and O2saturation&gt;94% In case of any respiratory depression,&#xD;
           emergency airway equipment's and drugs for resuscitation for airway management and&#xD;
           ventilation were kept ready.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Sample size calculation Sample size was calculated using Power Analysis and Sample&#xD;
                Size software program (PASS) version 15.0.5 for windows (2017) using the results&#xD;
                published by [S.S. Jahanbakhsh and S. Bazyar. Study on prophylactic impact of&#xD;
                ondansetron IV on intrathecal fentanyl-induced pruritus. British Journal of&#xD;
                Anesthesia 108 (S2): ii387-ii437 (2012) doi:10.1093/bja/aer489] (37) With the&#xD;
                incidence of post-operative opioid induced pruritis after spinal anesthesia as the&#xD;
                primary outcome. Patients will be allocated into two groups: control group (placebo&#xD;
                Group) and the study group (MG++ Group). Jahanbakhsh 2012 resulted in post-spinal&#xD;
                fentanyl induced pruritus incidence of 34% ondansetron group versus 60% in the&#xD;
                placebo group. The null hypothesis is assumed to be the absence of difference&#xD;
                between both treatment modalities. A sample of 65 patients is in each group needed&#xD;
                to achieve 80% power (1-β or the probability of rejecting the null hypothesis when&#xD;
                it is false) to detect a difference between the group proportions of 26% using&#xD;
                two-sided Fisher's exact test with a significance level of 0.05(α or the&#xD;
                probability of rejecting the null hypothesis when it is true). The expected number&#xD;
                of dropouts is 7 patients in each group so 72 patients will be enrolled into each&#xD;
                group with a total study sample size number of 144 patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis IBM's SPSS Statistics (Statistical Package for the Social Sciences) for&#xD;
      Windows (version 25) will be used for statistical analysis of the collected data.&#xD;
      Shapiro-Wilk test will be used to check the normality of the data distribution. Normally&#xD;
      distributed continuous variables will be expressed as mean ± SD while categorical variables&#xD;
      and the abnormally distributed continuous ones will be expressed as median and inter-quartile&#xD;
      range or number and percentage (as appropriate). Student t-test and Mann-Whitney will be used&#xD;
      for normally and abnormally distributed continuous data respectively. Chi-square tests will&#xD;
      be used for categorical data using the crosstabs function. All tests will be conducted with a&#xD;
      95% confidence interval. If needed, bivariate correlations will be assessed using Pearson's&#xD;
      or Spearman's correlation coefficient depending on the nature of data. P (probability) value&#xD;
      &lt; 0.05 will be considered statistically significant.&#xD;
