    <textblock>
      Provoked venous thromboembolism (VTE) is traditionally considered a transient acute disorder&#xD;
      requiring a limited duration of anticoagulant therapy. Patients who suffer deep vein&#xD;
      thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism (PE) following major surgery, major trauma, or periods&#xD;
      of immobility are generally treated with time-limited anticoagulation for 3 months. However,&#xD;
      provoked VTE patients have recently been recognized as a heterogeneous population comprised&#xD;
      of those with transient provoking and persistent provoking risk factors (1). Common risk&#xD;
      factors in provoked VTE such as obesity, immobility, atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease,&#xD;
      heart failure, chronic lung disease, chronic kidney disease, and inflammatory disorders&#xD;
      frequently contribute to an enduring rather than transient risk. Furthermore, epidemiological&#xD;
      studies (8,9) and the randomized clinical trial EINSTEIN CHOICE (3) suggest that VTE is best&#xD;
      characterized as a chronic disorder with periodic relapses. A landmark Danish National&#xD;
      Registry analysis demonstrated that patients who suffer provoked or unprovoked VTE have an&#xD;
      increased risk of recurrence over the ensuing 30 years and that recurrent PE causes increased&#xD;
      mortality (10). While the rate of VTE recurrence ranges 30-50% over 10 years for unprovoked&#xD;
      VTE (also termed idiopathic; unprovoked implies that an immediate trigger for the VTE cannot&#xD;
      be identified), recurrent events occur in about 20% of patients over 10 years after a&#xD;
      provoked event (provoked VTE is defined as post-operative, post-major trauma,&#xD;
      post-hospitalization, or related to pregnancy, hormonal contraception/replacement therapy, or&#xD;
      immobility) (11-13). Based on these data, provoked VTE patients represent a population&#xD;
      vulnerable to VTE recurrence, especially at the transition of care from the initial (acute)&#xD;
      treatment phase to the chronic treatment phase, at which point anticoagulation is&#xD;
      discontinued in most of these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The EINSTEIN CHOICE trial recently evaluated the safety and efficacy of regimens of full- or&#xD;
      lower-intensity anticoagulant therapy versus low-dose aspirin for secondary prevention of VTE&#xD;
      after an initial provoked or unprovoked event (2). The EINSTEIN CHOICE Investigators randomly&#xD;
      assigned 3396 patients with VTE to receive either once-daily rivaroxaban (at doses of 20 mg&#xD;
      or 10 mg) or 100 mg of aspirin. Prior to enrollment in EINSTEIN CHOICE, all study patients&#xD;
      completed 6 to 12 months of anticoagulation therapy, and their providers were in equipoise&#xD;
      regarding the need for extended anticoagulation. Approximately 60% of patients in EINSTEIN&#xD;
      CHOICE had suffered provoked VTE. Symptomatic recurrent VTE occurred in 17 of 1107 patients&#xD;
      (1.5%) receiving 20 mg of rivaroxaban and in 13 of 1127 patients (1.2%) receiving 10 mg of&#xD;
      rivaroxaban, and in 50 of 1131 patients (4.4%) receiving low-dose aspirin (hazard ratio for&#xD;
      20 mg of rivaroxaban vs. aspirin, 0.34; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.20 to 0.59; hazard&#xD;
      ratio for 10 mg of rivaroxaban vs. aspirin, 0.26; 95% CI, 0.14 to 0.47; P&lt;0.001 for both&#xD;
      comparisons). Rates of major bleeding were similar (0.5% in the group receiving 20 mg of&#xD;
      rivaroxaban, 0.4% in the group receiving 10 mg of rivaroxaban, and 0.3% in the low-dose&#xD;
      aspirin group) (2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data from 4,553 patients in EINSTEIN CHOICE and the EINSTEIN VTE Continued Treatment Study&#xD;
      demonstrate that provoked VTE patients with persistent provoking factors have a reduction in&#xD;
      recurrence with extended duration anticoagulation compared with low-dose aspirin or placebo&#xD;
      (1.5% vs. 4.9%) (2,3). Common persistent provoking factors included immobility, obesity,&#xD;
      heart failure, and chronic inflammatory disorders, such as Crohn's Disease and rheumatoid&#xD;
      arthritis. Despite being highly prevalent, persistent provoking factors are rarely considered&#xD;
      when stopping anticoagulation in patients with provoked VTE who have completed the typical 3-&#xD;
      to 6-month duration of therapy. The 2016 American College of Chest Physicians (ACCP)&#xD;
      Guidelines on Antithrombotic Therapy for VTE do not distinguish between transient and&#xD;
      persistent provoking risk factors and recommend limited-duration anticoagulation for provoked&#xD;
      events (4).&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, an emerging opinion is that optimal duration of anticoagulation in provoked VTE&#xD;
      patients should be determined based on data from the extended duration rivaroxaban trials&#xD;
      (5). Such a strategy breaks from the tradition of dichotomizing VTE as provoked or&#xD;
      unprovoked. Rather, persisting risk factors such as heart failure, obesity, family history of&#xD;
      VTE, acquired or hereditary thrombophilia, and immobilization are incorporated into the&#xD;
      decision-making process for pathways focused on secondary prevention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A suitable long-term strategy for secondary prevention has been recommended in evidence-based&#xD;
      clinical practice guidelines for patients with unprovoked VTE (4). Extended-duration&#xD;
      anticoagulation with warfarin or the direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) is validated and&#xD;
      recommended for prevention of recurrent unprovoked VTE in patients with a low-risk of&#xD;
      bleeding (6). However, current evidence-based clinical practice guidelines are inadequate for&#xD;
      secondary prevention in patients with provoked VTE based on several extended-duration&#xD;
      anticoagulation trials that included patients with provoked and unprovoked VTE. In a&#xD;
      randomized controlled trial of rivaroxaban for extended-duration secondary prevention in&#xD;
      patients with either provoked (26%) or unprovoked (74%) DVT, recurrent VTE occurred in 8&#xD;
      patients (1.3%) in the rivaroxaban group compared with 42 patients (7.1%) in the placebo&#xD;
      group (hazard ratio, 0.18; 95% CI, 0.09 to 0.39; P&lt;0.001, relative risk reduction, 82%) (3).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a landmark extension trial of patients with unprovoked VTE, the AMPLIFY-EXT trial compared&#xD;
      two doses of apixaban (2.5 mg and 5 mg, twice daily) with placebo in 2486 patients with VTE&#xD;
      who had completed 6 to 12 months of anticoagulation therapy and for whom there was clinical&#xD;
      equipoise regarding the need for extended-duration anticoagulant therapy for secondary&#xD;
      prevention (7). Symptomatic recurrent VTE or death from VTE occurred in 73 of the 829&#xD;
      patients (8.8%) who were receiving placebo versus 14 of the 840 patients (1.7%) who were&#xD;
      receiving 2.5 mg of apixaban and 14 of the 813 patients (1.7%) who were receiving 5 mg of&#xD;
      apixaban (p&lt;0.001 for both comparisons). In Kaplan-Meier analysis, the apixaban 2.5 mg twice&#xD;
      daily regimen demonstrated a major and clinically-relevant nonmajor bleeding rate similar to&#xD;
      that of placebo. While approximately 9% of the patients in the AMPLIFY-EXT trial had&#xD;
      transient or reversible risk factors for VTE, the provoked VTE population only accounted for&#xD;
      approximately 200 patients and precluded a well-powered analysis. Furthermore, the intent of&#xD;
      the AMPLIFY-EXT trial was to study unprovoked VTE (7). Finally, the HI-PRO trial is&#xD;
      evaluating a more complex aspect of VTE secondary prevention. Rather than using the simple&#xD;
      dichotomized view of VTE as provoked or unprovoked, HI-PRO is focusing on how the risk of&#xD;
      recurrence in patients with persisting provoking factors may be modulated by low-dose&#xD;
      apixaban. The foundation of this question is based on the current direction in which the&#xD;
      field of VTE is moving (5) and supported by the more pathophysiologically-sound ISTH&#xD;
      classification of risk factors (1).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Apixaban 2.5 mg twice daily may have additional advantages for extended-duration secondary&#xD;
      prevention of VTE compared with rivaroxaban 10 mg daily (which has U.S. FDA approval for&#xD;
      extended-duration therapy). Apixaban is a more pharmacokinetically rational regimen, given&#xD;
      the half-life of these two DOACs. In trials of stroke prevention of atrial fibrillation,&#xD;
      apixaban demonstrated a relatively lower frequency of gastrointestinal bleeding compared with&#xD;
      warfarin (14-17). Apixaban has fewer off-target side effects than rivaroxaban, which can&#xD;
      cause severe headache (necessitating urgent head CT) and severe rash.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on the emerging evidence that provoked VTE patients may require extended-duration&#xD;
      anticoagulation for secondary prevention, the apixaban 2.5 mg twice daily dose could be a&#xD;
      critical addition to our armamentarium in those at high risk for recurrence at the transition&#xD;
      of care from the acute to the chronic treatment phase. However, this hypothesis needs to be&#xD;
      tested in a clinical trial. The proposed study is a single-center, randomized controlled&#xD;
      trial conducted at Brigham and Women's Hospital (BWH) to evaluate the feasibility of&#xD;
      low-intensity apixaban (2.5 mg twice daily) in a study population exclusively comprised of&#xD;
      provoked VTE patients with persistently provoking risk factors for VTE.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study has the following specific aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim #1: To compare the 12-month rate of recurrent symptomatic VTE in patients with&#xD;
      provoked VTE and at least one persistent provoking factor who are randomized to either&#xD;
      apixaban (2.5 mg orally twice daily) as monotherapy or placebo after completing at least 3&#xD;
      months of therapeutic anticoagulation and who have a low risk of bleeding.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis #1: Compared with placebo, oral apixaban (2.5 mg twice daily) will reduce the&#xD;
      12-month rate of symptomatic VTE in patients with provoked VTE and at least one persistent&#xD;
      provoking factor who have completed at least 3 months of therapeutic anticoagulation and who&#xD;
      have a low risk of bleeding.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim #2: To compare the 12-month rate of ISTH major bleeding in patients with&#xD;
      provoked VTE and at least one persistent provoking factor who are randomized to either&#xD;
      apixaban (2.5 mg orally twice daily) as monotherapy or placebo after completing at least 3&#xD;
      months of therapeutic anticoagulation and who have a low risk of bleeding.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis #2: Compared with placebo, oral apixaban (2.5 mg twice daily) will be associated&#xD;
      with a similar rate of ISTH major bleeding at 12 months in patients with provoked VTE and at&#xD;
      least one persistent provoking factor who are randomized to either apixaban (2.5 mg orally&#xD;
      twice daily) as monotherapy or placebo after completing at least 3 months of therapeutic&#xD;
      anticoagulation and who have a low risk of bleeding.&#xD;

      VTE in patients with at least one persistent provoking factor who have completed at least 3&#xD;

             o NOTE: The risk of recurrent VTE following cessation of anticoagulation rises slowly&#xD;
             over the first 3-6 months (26). After this initial period, the cumulative risk of&#xD;
             recurrent VTE steepens. Using a limit of no greater than 6 months of interruption in&#xD;
             anticoagulation before potential reinitiation of anticoagulation as part of this trial&#xD;
             will safely facilitate enrollment as opposed to restricting the population to no&#xD;
             greater than 3 months of interruption.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Known severe thrombophilia (any increased titer antiphospholipid antibody or positive&#xD;
             lupus anticoagulant/DRVVT or deficiency of antithrombin, protein C, or protein S)&#xD;
             which would indicate long-term full therapeutic anticoagulation with a vitamin K&#xD;
             antagonist&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Life expectancy &lt; 12 months or hospice care&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prisoners or subjects who are involuntarily incarcerated&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects who are compulsorily detained for treatment of either a psychiatric or&#xD;
             physical (e.g., infectious disease) illness&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Receiving concurrent non-FDA-approved or investigational agents or has received an&#xD;
             investigational agent within the past 30 days prior to the first dose of study&#xD;
             treatment (with the exception of approved medications being used for an approved&#xD;
             indication, e.g., investigating a new dosing regimen for an approved indication)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any condition, which in the opinion of the investigator, would put the subject at an&#xD;
             unacceptable risk from participating in the study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any other medical, social, logistical, or psychological reason, which in the opinion&#xD;
             of the investigator, would preclude compliance with, or successful completion of, the&#xD;
             study protocol&#xD;
