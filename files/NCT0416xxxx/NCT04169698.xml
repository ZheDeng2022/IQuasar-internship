      The management of bone disease has often been neglected post-transplantation, when the&#xD;
      clinical focus is on allograft function and immunological sequelae. However, most renal&#xD;
      transplant recipients (RTRs) have pre-existing CKD-MBD, which results in changes to mineral&#xD;
      metabolism and reduced bone mineral density (BMD) and quality, which are linked to an&#xD;
      increased incidence of fractures and cardiovascular disease. Bone loss is greatest in the&#xD;
      first 6-12 months post-transplantation, during which period any intervention is likely to be&#xD;
      of greatest benefit. Anti-resorptive agents all inhibit bone resorption. Since&#xD;
      bisphosphonates and densoumab are the most widely used anti-resorptive agents for&#xD;
      osteoporosis, we conduct this prospective interventional comparative study to compare the&#xD;
      efficacy and tolerability of alendronate versus denosumab in de novo kidney transplant&#xD;
      recipients with reduced bone mineral density, in the first 12 months treatment after kidney&#xD;
      transplantation.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) exhibit a complex form of bone disease defined by&#xD;
      KDIGO as &quot;Mineral and Bone Disorder&quot; (CKD-MBD). CKD-MBD generally encompasses two&#xD;
      pathological disorders, namely vascular calcification and renal osteodystrophy, which is the&#xD;
      bone health impairment associated with chronic kidney disease. Among the complications&#xD;
      associated with renal osteodystrophy, hip or vertebral fractures are associated with an&#xD;
      increase in morbidity and mortality in patients with end-stage kidney disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CKD-MBD is a systemic disease that links disorders of mineral and bone metabolism due to CKD&#xD;
      to either one or all of the following: abnormalities of calcium, phosphorus, parathyroid&#xD;
      hormone or vitamin D metabolism; abnormalities in bone turnover, mineralization, volume,&#xD;
      linear growth or strength; or vascular or other soft-tissue calcification. Consequently,&#xD;
      since bone status in recently transplanted patients reflects several years of CKD-MBD, it&#xD;
      would be useful to assess bone status in this population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The management of bone disease has often been neglected post-transplantation, when the&#xD;
      clinical focus is on allograft function and immunological sequelae. However, most renal&#xD;
      transplant recipients (RTRs) have pre-existing CKD-MBD, which results in changes to mineral&#xD;
      metabolism and reduced bone mineral density (BMD) and quality, which are linked to an&#xD;
      increased incidence of fractures and cardiovascular disease. Pre-existing renal&#xD;
      osteodystrophy, including adynamic bone disease, is further affected post-transplantation by&#xD;
      the use of immunosuppressive medications (glucocorticoids and calcineurin-inhibitors),&#xD;
      variable renal allograft function and post-transplantation diabetes mellitus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Successful renal transplantation corrects many metabolic abnormalities associated with the&#xD;
      development of renal osteodystrophy. However, osteopenia and osteoporosis remain prevalent,&#xD;
      even in patients with well-functioning grafts. Increasing attention has focused on preventing&#xD;
      late complications of transplantation and on patient quality of life by addressing factors&#xD;
      affecting long-term morbidity, such as cardiovascular risk, post-transplantation diabetes&#xD;
      mellitus, cancer, and bone disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The spectrum of bone diseases in kidney transplant recipients includes renal osteodystrophy,&#xD;
      osteoporosis, bone fracture, and osteonecrosis. Earlier studies after transplantation&#xD;
      indicate that BMD declines by 4%-10% in the first 6 months, with a further decrease of&#xD;
      0.4%-4.5% in lumbar BMD between 6 and 12 months. After 1 year, BMD remains relatively stable&#xD;
      with no further decline but at significantly lower levels than healthy controls. This&#xD;
      reduction in BMD contributes to an increased risk of fractures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Osteoporosis is defined as skeletal disorder characterized by compromised bone strength with&#xD;
      low BMD and bone quality predisposing to an increased risk of fracture and bone fragility.&#xD;
      Osteoporosis has also been defined quantitatively using BMD and can be expressed as standard&#xD;
      deviation (SD) score comparing an individual's BMD with that of a reference population as&#xD;
      measured by dual x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA). A T-score that is ≤ -2.5 is indicative of&#xD;
      osteoporosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In RTRs, a noninvasive cost-effective tool regarding diagnostic evaluation of osteoporosis is&#xD;
      BMD monitoring with DEXA scans. BMD is the amount of bone mass per unit volume (volumetric&#xD;
      density), or per unit area (areal density), and both can be measured in vivo by densitometric&#xD;
      techniques. A wide variety of techniques is available to assess bone mineral that are&#xD;
      reviewed elsewhere. The most widely used are based on X-ray absorptiometry of bone,&#xD;
      particularly dual energy X-ray absorptiometry, since the absorption of X-rays is very&#xD;
      sensitive to the calcium content of the tissue of which bone is the most important source.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DEXA is obtained by aiming two radiograph beams with different energy levels at the patient's&#xD;
      bones. After subtracting the soft tissue absorption, the BMD is determined. DEXA is the most&#xD;
      widely used noninvasive technique for measuring BMD in the general population. Low BMD by&#xD;
      DEXA is a robust and consistent risk factor for fracture and treatments that increase BMD&#xD;
      reduce fracture risk.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bone mineral density is most often described as a T- or Z score, both of which are units of&#xD;
      SD. The T-score describes the number of SDs by which the BMD in an individual differs from&#xD;
      the mean value expected in young healthy individuals. The Z-score describes the number of SDs&#xD;
      by which the BMD in an individual differs from the mean value expected for age and sex. It is&#xD;
      mostly used in children and adolescents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bone loss is greatest in the first 6-12 months post-transplantation, during which period any&#xD;
      intervention is likely to be of greatest benefit. Anti-resorptive agents all inhibit bone&#xD;
      resorption. The FDA-approved anti-resorptive agents include calcitonin, estrogens, selective&#xD;
      estrogen receptor modulators, bisphosphonates and denosumab. Each anti-resorptive agent has&#xD;
      each owns unique mechanism of action. Since bisphosphonates and densoumab are the most widely&#xD;
      used anti-resorptive agents for osteoporosis, these two agents will be focused here.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is strong evidence that bisphosphonates prevent post-transplantation bone loss;&#xD;
      however, data are lacking that this clearly extends to a reduction in fracture incidence.&#xD;
      Denosumab is a potential alternative to vitamin D receptor agonists and bisphosphonates in&#xD;
      reducing post-transplantation bone loss; however, further studies are needed to demonstrate&#xD;
      its safety in patients with a significantly reduced estimated glomerular filtration rate&#xD;
      (eGFR). Clinical judgement remains the cornerstone of this complex clinical problem,&#xD;
      providing a strong rationale for the formation of combined endocrinology and nephrology&#xD;
      clinics to treat patients with Chronic Kidney Disease-Mineral and Bone Disorder, before and&#xD;
      after transplantation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bisphosphonates are chemical analogues of naturally occurring pyrophosphates (P-O-P),&#xD;
      degradation products of adenosine triphosphate metabolism. Pyrophosphates are rapidly&#xD;
      metabolized by the ubiquitous presence of pyrophosphatases, while bisphosphonates (P-C-P) are&#xD;
      not metabolized. Once entering the blood stream, bisphosphonates are rapidly taken up by&#xD;
      bone, the only tissue that binds bisphosphonates. In bone, bisphosphonates inhibit bone&#xD;
      resorption by two mechanisms: a physiochemical one stabilizing the calcium-phosphorus surface&#xD;
      and a cellular one by inhibiting osteoclast activity. Bisphosphonates are cleared by the&#xD;
      kidney both by filtration and active proximal tubular secretion. Bisphosphonates are retained&#xD;
      in bone in the remodeling resorption cavity and the amount of bisphosphonate retained in&#xD;
      probably a function of the baseline remodeling space, the chronic rate of bone turnover and&#xD;
      the glomerular filteration rate (GFR). While oral bisphosphonates are poorly (less than 1% of&#xD;
      a single dose) absorbed and 50% of that excreted unchanged by the kidney, intravenous&#xD;
      bisphosphonate show a 100% bioavailability with still 50% of an intravenous dose excreted by&#xD;
      the kidney. Treatment with bisphosphonates before and after renal transplantation had a&#xD;
      favorable effect on BMD, with bisphosphonates, such as pamidronate and alendronate, being&#xD;
      preferable to other treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Denosumab is a full length human monoclonal antibody against the receptor activator of&#xD;
      nuclear factor kappa-B ligand (RANKL), a cytokine that is essential for the formation,&#xD;
      function, and survival of osteoclasts. By binding RANKL, denosumab prevents the interaction&#xD;
      of RANKL with RANK on osteoclasts and reversibly inhibits osteoclast-mediated bone&#xD;
      resorption. It was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in June 2010 as a new&#xD;
      treatment for postmenopausal osteoporosis in women who are at high risk of fractures.&#xD;
      Denosumab is not renally cleared, which makes it more attractive than bisphosphonates in&#xD;
      patients with significant graft dysfunction, although there are little data of its use in the&#xD;
      transplant population. Denosumab treatment may be useful to improve bone health in the first&#xD;
      year after kidney transplantation and was safe except for a higher number of urinary tract&#xD;
      infections and asymptomatic episodes of hypocalcemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are no comparative studies of different agents available for treatment of RTRs, who&#xD;
      remain a heterogeneous population in terms of renal function. However, given that bone loss&#xD;
      is greatest in the first 12 months, any benefit will be greatest in this period. KDIGO 2017&#xD;
      guidelines suggest treatment with vitamin D, calcitriol/alfacalcidol, and/or antiresorptive&#xD;
      agents be considered in patients in the first 12 months after kidney transplant with an&#xD;
      estimated glomerular filtration rate greater than approximately 30 ml/min/1.73 m2 and low&#xD;
      BMD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Finally, this prospective interventional comparative study will be conducted to compare the&#xD;
      efficacy and tolerability of alendronate versus denosumab in de novo kidney transplant&#xD;
      recipients with reduced bone mineral density, in the first 12 months treatment after kidney&#xD;
      transplantation.&#xD;
