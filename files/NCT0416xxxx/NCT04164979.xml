    <time_frame>6 Months</time_frame>
    <description>This is defined as the percentage of subjects who are free of progression 6 months after study treatment start. Progression is defined death, radiographic progression or clinical deterioration attributed disease progression as judged by an investigator. Radiographic progression is defined using the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST v1.1), as a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions and an absolute increase of at least 5 mm and/or appearance of new lesions.</description>

    <description>To evaluate the tolerability of administering cabozantinib in combination with pembrolizumab in patients with advanced gastric and gastroesophageal adenocarcinoma from the start of treatment, duration of treatment and up to 4 weeks after completion of study treatment.

    <description>To assess the overall response rate to the combination of cabozantinib and pembrolizumab. Overall response rate (ORR) is defined as confirmed complete response (CR) and partial response (PR). Per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST v1.1): Complete Response (CR) is defined as the disappearance of all target lesions; Partial Response (PR) is defined as a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions. ORR = CR + PR</description>
