  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study uses an unconventional radiotherapy schedule developed at our institute,&#xD;
      consisting of a short course high-dose partial irradiation targeting exclusively the hypoxic&#xD;
      segment of a bulky tumors, which in our preliminary study has shown to be capable of inducing&#xD;
      abscopal and bystander effects. This approach is delivered by using a stereotactic&#xD;
      radiotherapy technique so as to spare nearby organs at risk including the peritumoral immune&#xD;
      microenvironment from irradiation as much as possible. Our approach consists of a single or&#xD;
      up to 3 radiotherapy doses of at least 10 Gy per fraction prescribed to the 70% isodose line&#xD;
      encompassing the hypoxic target volume. Radiotherapy will be administered at the precise&#xD;
      timing determined specifically for each patient based on the serially mapped homeostatic&#xD;
      immune fluctuations by monitoring the blood levels of the cytokines and inflammatory markers&#xD;
      over the 2 weeks prior to irradiation. This is done in order to synchronize the radiation&#xD;
      treatment with the favorable, most active anti-tumor immune system phase, so as to stimulate&#xD;
      and increase anti-tumor immune system activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a monocentric, prospective, two-arm, phase I proof of principle study in which the&#xD;
      investigator will enroll subjects with oligometastatic and/or locally advanced (N+) cancers&#xD;
      with at least one &quot;bulky&quot; lesion (maximum diameter of at least 6 cm or greater). Patients&#xD;
      with life expectancy of at least 3 months, who are ineligible for systemic therapy or&#xD;
      experience disease progression with systemic therapies will be included. Radiotherapy will be&#xD;
      administered to arm 1 at an estimated &quot;less favorable time-position in immune cycle&quot;, while&#xD;
      the second arm will have it administered at the estimated &quot;most favorable time-position in&#xD;
      immune cycle&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary endpoint will be the response rate of the non-targeted effects both bystander&#xD;
      (local, at the level of the partially treated bulky tumor) and abscopal (distant, at the&#xD;
      non-treated metastatic sites), defined as a tumor regression of at least 30%. Secondary&#xD;
      endpoints will be safety, survival and analysis of the best timing for the administration of&#xD;
      radiotherapy.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of our new method for high dose&#xD;
      partial irradiation of the hypoxic tumor segment of bulky masses in terms of the intentional&#xD;
      induction of the non-targeted effects of radiotherapy in patients with metastatic or locally&#xD;
      advanced (N+) malignancies who are ineligible for, or currently in progression under systemic&#xD;
      therapies. By mapping the homeostatic immune fluctuations serially, and by monitoring the&#xD;
      blood levels of the cytokines and inflammatory markers over the 2 weeks prior to irradiation,&#xD;
      radiotherapy will be administered at the precise, optimal timing in order to stimulate and to&#xD;
      increase anti-tumor immune system activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary endpoint: bystander (local) and abscopal (distant, metastatic or lymph nodal sites)&#xD;
      response rates.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary endpoints: overall safety and tolerability profile of our new radiotherapy method,&#xD;
      progression-free survival rates at local and distant sites, as well as overall survival&#xD;
      rates, efficacy of this regimen in palliating symptoms, neoadjuvant potential of this novel&#xD;
      radiotherapy for unresectable/borderline resectable bulky lesions, optimal timing for&#xD;
      radiotherapy to be administered based on the fluctuating/oscillating suppressed anti-tumor&#xD;
      immune response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This monocentric, two-arm prospective phase I proof of principle trial will enroll 26&#xD;
      patients from a single institution: KABEG Klinikum Klagenfurt am Woerthersee, Austria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the visit, and after clinical examination, patients will be eligible if they satisfy&#xD;
      the inclusion criteria for participation in this pilot study on the use of the novel&#xD;
      stereotactic radiotherapy technique which will consist of partial irradiation of exclusively&#xD;
      hypoxic segments of their bulky tumors, with 1-3 high dose fractions of radiotherapy based on&#xD;
      the tumor's site, volume and its relationship with nearby organs. The irradiation will take&#xD;
      place within 3 weeks of clinical examination. After the treatment, the patient will be&#xD;
      regularly followed for the evaluation of all endpoints. If any severe toxicity (grade ≥3 per&#xD;
      CTCAE v 4.3 criteria) occurs in the first 7 evaluable patients, the trial will stop. Safety&#xD;
      reviews will continue on an ongoing basis, provided that severe toxicities do not occur in&#xD;
      more than 15% of patients. In the case of eventual disease progression during the follow-up,&#xD;
      the patients will be offered additional local (radiotherapy) or systemic (chemotherapy,&#xD;
      immunotherapy, hormonal therapy) treatment if indicated by current NCCN (National&#xD;
      Comprehensive Cancer Network) treatment recommendations and guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Routine surveillance computerized axial tomography (CT) imaging of the whole body will be&#xD;
      performed beginning at 1 month (+/- 3 days) after treatment to allow for endpoint assessment&#xD;
      - or before in any case of clinical suspicion of disease progression. Routine CT imaging&#xD;
      surveillance will continue per standard of care. Patients will also be followed clinically&#xD;
      with physical and laboratory examinations as indicated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tumor assessments will be completed on the CRF using RECIST v1.1. criteria. Radiographic and&#xD;
      clinical evaluations will be conducted with the same schedule. The investigator will assess&#xD;
      anti-tumor activity based on radiological assessments and clinical evaluations of patients&#xD;
      using RECIST v1.1 at baseline, 1 and 2 months post-treatment, and every 3 months thereafter&#xD;
      until confirmed disease progression per RECIST v1.1, regardless of the discontinuation of&#xD;
      study treatment or the initiation of subsequent anti-cancer therapy. Radiological tumor&#xD;
      assessments will also be conducted whenever disease progression is suspected (e.g.&#xD;
      symptomatic deterioration or physical examination findings suggestive of mucosal recurrence).&#xD;
