  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      As part of a graduated medical-surgical strategy, and in our practice, surgery for&#xD;
      Dupuytren's disease appears as a second-line treatment indicated in a situation of failure&#xD;
      after treatment with percutaneous needle aponeurotomy.The results of second-line surgery in&#xD;
      terms of safety and efficacy have not been specifically evaluated in patients who underwent&#xD;
      failed percutaneous needle aponeurotomy. This evaluation nevertheless appears necessary for&#xD;
      the validation of a medical-surgical strategy during Dupuytren's disease.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Dupuytren's disease is characterised by retractile fibrosis of the superficial palmar&#xD;
      aponeurosis that can result in irreversible flexing of the fingers and long-term disability.&#xD;
      The treatment of Dupuytren's disease, whether medical or surgical, remains symptomatic. It is&#xD;
      based in Europe on percutaneous needle aponeurotomy and surgical aponeurectomy. Its&#xD;
      objectives are the reduction of the deformity of the fingers in flexum, and that of the&#xD;
      incapacity that generates the illness. Percutaneous needle aponeurotomy for Dupuytren's&#xD;
      disease was developed by Jean-Luc Lermusiaux in 1972 in the Rheumatology Department of the&#xD;
      Lariboisière Hospital in Paris. Its efficiency, its tolerance, its simplicity, its low cost&#xD;
      and the possibility of repeating it make it a benchmark treatment. Percutaneous needle&#xD;
      aponeurotomy is, for many, if the existence of this technique is known and understood, the&#xD;
      first-line treatment of Dupuytren's disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As part of a graduated medical-surgical strategy, and in our practice, surgery for&#xD;
      Dupuytren's disease appears as a second-line treatment indicated in a situation of failure&#xD;
      after treatment with percutaneous needle aponeurotomy. The safety and efficacy of the surgery&#xD;
      was evaluated in the context of a first-line treatment of Dupuytren's disease. The results of&#xD;
      second-line surgery in terms of safety and efficacy have not been specifically evaluated in&#xD;
      patients who underwent failed percutaneous needle aponeurotomy. This evaluation nevertheless&#xD;
      appears necessary for the validation of a medical-surgical strategy during Dupuytren's&#xD;
      disease.&#xD;
