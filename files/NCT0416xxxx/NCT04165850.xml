  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open label, off label study, to provide interested ALS patients with&#xD;
      Ciprofloxacin/Celecoxib fixed dose combination, while assessing safety and tolerability and&#xD;
      routine disease progression measures (ALSFRS-R and Vital Capacity).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients will be prescribed a fixed dose combination of Ciprofloxacin and Celecoxib to be&#xD;
      taken thrice daily, and will be monitored for safety and tolerability. Additionally, routine&#xD;
      disease progression measures will be assessed.&#xD;
