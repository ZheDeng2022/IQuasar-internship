  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Mitochondrial diseases, estimated prevalence 1 in 4,300 adults, is caused by pathogenic&#xD;
      mutations in genes finally encoding for mitochondrial proteins of the various enzyme&#xD;
      complexes of the OXPHOS. Among these mutations, the 3243A&gt;G nucleotide change in the&#xD;
      mitochondrially encoded transfer RNALeu(UUR) leucine 1 gene (MT TL 1) is the most prevalent&#xD;
      one. The OXPHOS dysfunction resulting from such mutations leads to increased production of&#xD;
      reactive oxygen species (ROS), ultimately leading to irreversible oxidative damage of&#xD;
      macromolecules, or to more selective and reversible redox modulation of cell signaling that&#xD;
      may impact (adult) neurogenesis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite advances in the understanding of mitochondrial disorders, treatment options are&#xD;
      extremely limited and, to date, largely supportive. Therefore, there is an urgent need for&#xD;
      novel treatments. KH176, a new active pharmaceutical ingredient (API), is an orally&#xD;
      bio-available small molecule under development for the treatment of these disorders (see&#xD;
      Section 1.4). The current study will further evaluate the effect of KH176 in various&#xD;
      cognitive domains and evaluate the effect of different doses of KH176 (See Section 1.5).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In view of the growing recognition of the importance of mitochondrial function in maintaining&#xD;
      cognitive processes in the brain, as well as the understanding of the safety profile and&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics of KH176 following the two clinical studies described above, a more detailed&#xD;
      study is indicated of the effects of KH176 in various cognitive domains, using the confirmed&#xD;
      safe and well-tolerated KH176 dose of 100 mg bid, as well as a lower dose of 50 mg bid. The&#xD;
      primary objective is an evaluation of KH176 in the attention domain of cognitive functioning,&#xD;
      as assessed by the visual identification test score of the Cogstate computerised cognitive&#xD;
      testing battery.&#xD;

      For this study, a 3 x 3 crossover design will be applied, i.e., with 3 treatments, 3&#xD;
      sequences and 3 periods, employing a Latin square assignment. Using this design, each subject&#xD;
      will function as his/her own control. This will reduce variability and thus increase the&#xD;
      chances of observing true effects between treatment periods (effects of treatment compared to&#xD;
      placebo). In each treatment period, assessments will be performed at baseline prior to dosing&#xD;
      and post dosing, enabling a change from baseline analysis and enabling the possibility to&#xD;
      compare baseline conditions for each treatment period. The treatment period in each treatment&#xD;
      is 28 days (4 weeks), which is supported by the pre-clinical toxicology program. In mouse&#xD;
      studies, a 4-week period was sufficient to observe clinically relevant effects.&#xD;

               -  Migraine (with or without aura), specified by at least five attacks fulfilling&#xD;
                  diagnostic criteria B-D:&#xD;
&#xD;
        B. Headache attacks lasting 4-72 hours (untreated or unsuccessfully treated)&#xD;
&#xD;
        C. Headache has at least two of the following four characteristics:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. unilateral location&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. pulsating quality&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. moderate or severe pain intensity&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. aggravation or causing avoidance of routine physical activity (e.g. walking or&#xD;
             climbing stairs)&#xD;
&#xD;
        D. During headache at least one of the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. nausea and/or vomiting 2. photophobia and phonophobia 6. Attentional dysfunction score&#xD;
        (Cogstate Identification test) ≥ 0.5 standard deviations poorer than healthy controls at&#xD;
        Screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Disease appropriate physical and mental health as established at Screening by medical&#xD;
        history, physical examination, ECG and vital signs recording, and results of clinical&#xD;
        chemistry and haematology testing as judged by the investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. Objectified Left Ventricular Ejection Fraction (LVEF) ≥45% (echocardiography, or&#xD;
        otherwise).&#xD;
&#xD;
        9. Left Ventricular (LV) wall thickness ≤15 mm. 10. Left atrium dilatation ≤ 40 mL/m2.&#xD;
        Note: No need to test LV parameters (criteria #8, #9, #10) if favourable echocardiography&#xD;
        (or otherwise) results dated less than 6 months prior to Screening are available.&#xD;
&#xD;
        11. Women of childbearing potential must be willing to use highly effective contraceptive&#xD;
        methods during the entire study, i.e., combined (estrogen and progestogen containing) oral,&#xD;
        intravaginal or transdermal hormonal contraception associated with inhibition of&#xD;
        ovulation;, oral, injectable or implantable progestogen-only hormonal contraception&#xD;
        associated with inhibition of ovulation; use of an intrauterine device; an intrauterine&#xD;
        hormone releasing system, bilateral tubal occlusion and vasectomy of the partner.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Any hormonal contraception method must be supplemented with a barrier method (preferably&#xD;
        male condom).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Vasectomised partner is considered a highly effective birth control method provided that&#xD;
        partner is the sole sexual partner of the subject and that the vasectomised partner has&#xD;
        received medical assessment of the surgical success. Sexual abstinence is considered a&#xD;
        highly effective method only if defined as refraining from heterosexual intercourse during&#xD;
        the entire period of risk associated with the study treatments. Reliability of sexual&#xD;
        abstinence needs to be evaluated in relation to the duration of the clinical trial and the&#xD;
        preferred and usual lifestyle of the subject. Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar,&#xD;
        ovulation, symptothermal, post-ovulation methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods&#xD;
        of contraception.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Note 1: Natural family planning methods, female condom, cervical cap or diaphragm are not&#xD;
        considered adequate contraceptive methods in the context of this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Note 2: To be considered not of childbearing potential, potential female subjects must be&#xD;
        post-menopausal for at least two years, or have been surgically sterilised (bilateral tubal&#xD;
        ligation, hysterectomy or bilateral oophorectomy) for at least 6 months prior to Screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Note 3: KH176 has been shown non-genotoxic judged from the Ames test, Chromosomal&#xD;
        Aberration test and in vivo Micronucleus test. Moreover, appreciable systemic exposure from&#xD;
        the exposure to (~2.5 mL) semen is extremely unlikely. However, until reproductive&#xD;
        toxicology studies have confirmed that KH176 does not adversely affect normal reproduction&#xD;
        in adult males and females, as well as causing developmental toxicity in the offspring, the&#xD;
        following contraceptive precautions must be adhered to:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  male subjects with female partners of childbearing potential must be willing to use&#xD;
             condoms during the entire study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  female partners of childbearing potential of male subjects must be willing to use&#xD;
             adequate contraceptive methods during the entire study, i.e., a hormonal contraceptive&#xD;
             method (pill, vaginal ring, patch, implant, injectable, hormone-medicated intrauterine&#xD;
             device) or an intrauterine device.&#xD;
&#xD;
             12. Able to comply with the study requirements, including swallowing study medication.&#xD;

          3. Documented history of ventricular tachycardia (HR&gt;110 beats/min).&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. History of acute heart failure, (family) history of unexplained syncope or congenital&#xD;

&#xD;
               1. (multi)vitamins, co-enzyme Q10, Vitamin E, riboflavin, and anti-oxidant&#xD;
                  supplements (including, but not limited to idebenone/EPI-743, mitoQ); unless&#xD;
