      Patients eligible for the study will be selected on Fridays during the HIV consultation at&#xD;
      the Infectious Diseases Department. Patients that meet the inclusion and exclusion criteria,&#xD;
      will be randomized and assigned in two groups 1:1. A group will start intervention with FMT&#xD;
      (fecal matter transplant) through frozen capsules and after seven days, antiretroviral&#xD;
      therapy (ART) will be started. Patients in the other group will be given placebo capsules and&#xD;
      after seven days ART will be started. The frozen capsules of FMT will be ingested orally with&#xD;
      a frequency of 15 capsules every 12 hours for 4 doses 7 days prior ART start and on weeks 0,&#xD;
      4, 8 and 12 after ART start. Subsequently, blood samples will be taken to monitor the immune&#xD;
      status with CD4 T lymphocytes and HIV viral load during week 0, 4, 8, 12 and 24 after ART&#xD;
      start.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Throughout the study period, subjects can carry out a free diet, moderate alcohol intake,&#xD;
      perform their daily activities and abstain from any of the elimination criteria. Medical&#xD;
      consultations will be made on days -7 to ART start, day 1, 30, 60, 90 and 120 after ART&#xD;
      start, where clinical examination and elimination criteria will be evaluated.&#xD;

      Study design: Prospective controlled study experimental comparative Study duration: 1 year&#xD;
      The number of patients to enroll: 20 patients. After being randomized, selected patients who&#xD;
      meet the criteria for inclusion and exclusion will be assigned 1:1 in two groups. A group&#xD;
      will start treatment with FMT through frozen capsules, and ART at the same time; and another&#xD;
      group will star placebo capsules and ART.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The frozen capsules will be ingested orally at a frequency of 15 capsules every 12 hours for&#xD;
      four doses 7 days prior ART start and on weeks 0, 4, 8 and 12 after ART start. Each capsule&#xD;
      must be ingested over a period no longer than 1 hour of the anterior capsule.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subsequently, blood samples will be taken through peripheral vein puncture with the&#xD;
      extraction of 10 ml of venous blood to monitor the immune status with CD4 T lymphocytes and&#xD;
      HIV viral load. A total of 4 blood samples will be taken during week 4, 8, 12 and 24 after&#xD;
      ART start.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Medical consultations will be made every 4 weeks, on days -7 days prior ART start, day 1, 30,&#xD;
      60, 90 and 120 where vital signs, symptoms or signs of organ systems, determination of&#xD;
      weight, BMI, adverse effects and elimination criteria will be assessed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, feces samples from each patient will be taken during medical consultation on&#xD;
      week 0, 8 and 24 after ART start to evaluate the modification of the intestinal microbiome&#xD;
      after the intervention on both groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the study period, subjects may carry a free diet, moderate intake of alcohol and&#xD;
      perform their daily activities as they refrain free from any of the elimination criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will last 1 year and the samples taken will be frozen and stored in the Infectious&#xD;
      Diseases Department of the Hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Selection of Fecal Microbiota donors:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The selection of fecal microbiota donors is based on:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Medical history, body weight, no medication uses such as antibiotics and proton pump&#xD;
           inhibitors, no trips and no diarrhea 6 months prior donation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The absence of chronic infections such as Hepatitis B, Hepatitis C, and HIV determined&#xD;
           by immunoassay.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Negative Rose Bengal test and V.D.R.L&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Normal complete blood count and liver function tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fecal sample analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Fresh microscopy analysis to detect leukocytes and parasites (including protozoa and&#xD;
           helminths)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Stool culture to rule out the presence of enteropathogens, including Salmonella spp.,&#xD;
           Shigella spp., Aeromonas spp., Plesiomonas spp., Vibrio spp. and Clostridiodes diffcile.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Gastrointestinal panel by multiple polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using BioFire&#xD;
           Filmarray which includes the detection of:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Bacteria: Campylobacter (C. jejuni, C. coi, C. upsaliensis), Clostridiodes difficile&#xD;
           (toxins A / B), Plesiomonas shigelloides, Salmonella spp., Yersinia enterocolitica,&#xD;
           Vibrio (V. parahaemolytic , V. vulnificus and V. cholerae), Escherichia coli O157: H7,&#xD;
           enteroaggregative E. coli (EAEC), enteropathogenic E. coli (EPEC), enterotoxigenic E.&#xD;
           coli (ETEC), Shiga toxin producing E. coli (STEC) stx1 / stx2, Shigella sp.&#xD;
           enteroinvasive E. coli (EIEC).&#xD;
&#xD;
           Virus: Adenovirus F 40/41, Astrovirus, Norovirus GI / GII, Rotavirus A, Sapovirus (I,&#xD;
           II, IV and V) Parasites: Cryptosporidium sp., Cyclospora cayetanensis, Entamoeba&#xD;
           histolytica and Giardia lamblia.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Detection of genes associated with drug resistance by endpoint PCR; including genes&#xD;
           encoding extended spectrum beta-lactamases (TEM, CTX; SHV, CMY) and carbapenemases (VIM,&#xD;
           NDM, IMP, KPC, OXA-48).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once all the stages of evaluation are completed only negative subjects for all the tests and&#xD;
      in which there is no evidence of infection are selected as donors. The scrutiny and&#xD;
      laboratory tests are considered valid during the following 4 weeks, so if new donation of&#xD;
      feces is required, the process will be carried out again.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample Preparation fecal microbiota All samples will be mixed with 10% glycerol and frozen at&#xD;
      -70°C in a period not exceeding 60 minutes after collection. They will be mixed and then&#xD;
      suspended in saline 0.9%. The final mixture will be filtered to remove particles greater than&#xD;
      330 microns, finally adding glycerol as cryoprotectant. This mixture is carried to the&#xD;
      encapsulation process using sterile capsules for enteral liberation, in two sizes. The first&#xD;
      capsule is filled with a mixture of feces and sealed with its counterpart, and then the&#xD;
      sealed capsule becomes encapsulated in a second capsule. The final product is stored frozen&#xD;
      until 60 minutes before use. The administration will only be oral.&#xD;
