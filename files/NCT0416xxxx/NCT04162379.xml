      Introduction: pain in cancer patients is based on the concept of the World Health&#xD;
      Organization (WHO) analgesic ladder and was recently updated with the EAPC (European&#xD;
      Association for Palliative Care) recommendations. (1) Cancer pain management using opioids&#xD;
      administered alone or in combination with adjuvant analgesics. Spinal cord compression,&#xD;
      superior vena cava obstruction, raised intracranial pressure, and bowel obstruction is better&#xD;
      established than in other nonspecific indications Corticosteroids adjuvant use for&#xD;
      neuropathic and bone pain treatment. However, despite widespread use of corticosteroids,&#xD;
      scientific evidence about its efficacy in cancer pain management is limited. According to the&#xD;
      cancer Pain Management Index (PMI) (2), approximately one-third of patients do not receive&#xD;
      appropriate analgesia proportional to their pain intensity (PI). This protocol aims to&#xD;
      clarify pors and cons of interrupted steroid dosing in chronic cancer pain WHO stepladder&#xD;
      analgesia protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      World Health Organization (WHO) analgesic ladder; Step I recommends non-opioid analgesics for&#xD;
      mild pain. Step II specifies the use of weak opioids for moderate pain. Step III comprises&#xD;
      the use of strong opioids for severe pain (4). Recently the European Association for&#xD;
      Palliative Care (EAPC) recommendations (5, 6). Nociceptive and neuropathic components of&#xD;
      cancer pain responsiveness to opioids is necessary to achieve good pain alleviation. Medical&#xD;
      data demonstrate that complete pain relief is rarely achieved in cancer patients;&#xD;
      nonetheless, it can be significantly reduced (7). However, some authors have suggested&#xD;
      eliminating the second step of the analgesic ladder, with weak opioids being replaced with&#xD;
      low doses of oral morphine (8, 9).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inadequate assessment leads to inadequate management of cancer pain. Brief Pain Inventory&#xD;
      (PI), a pain assessment tool that measures both the intensity of the pain (sensory dimension)&#xD;
      and the interference of cancer pain in the patient's life (reactive dimension). It also&#xD;
      queries the patient about pain relief, pain quality, and patient perception of the cause of&#xD;
      pain. (10) The Pain Management Index (PMI) is widely used in the assessment of pain&#xD;
      management, and negative scores are traditionally considered to indicate inadequate pain&#xD;
      management. PMI scores are inversely associated with the proportion of patients with pain&#xD;
      interference (PI). However, PMI scores of - 1 do not always indicate inadequate pain&#xD;
      management; pain management should, therefore, be evaluated from multiple perspectives.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothalamic-pituitary-Adrenal Axis (HPA) axis, sudden cessation of corticosteroid therapy&#xD;
      may result in adrenal failure. Clinically significant HPA axis suppression is rare if a&#xD;
      steroid is administered for less than 3 weeks (11). Steroid withdrawal syndromes: Relapse of&#xD;
      the disease, symptoms of steroid withdrawal syndrome such as lethargy, depression, anorexia,&#xD;
      nausea, myalgia, or arthralgia (12). Steroid Tapering: The most suitable method of tapering&#xD;
      has not been established as yet. After the glucocorticoid withdrawal, the hypothalamic and&#xD;
      pituitary functions recover first, followed by the adrenocortical function. Full recovery of&#xD;
      adrenal function can take months, or even up to a year (13), especially after prolonged&#xD;
      steroid treatment with high doses. A possible scheme of steroid discontinuation is&#xD;
      Prednisolone or equivalent daily dose≥ 7.5 mg reduce rapidly 2.5 mg every 3-4 days, then&#xD;
      5-7.5 mg reduce by 1 mg every 2-4 weeks, then &lt; 5 mg Reduce by 1 mg every 2-4 weeks (13).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prednisolone relative biologic potencies are; Salt retention 0.75, Anti-inflammatory effect&#xD;
      3, and HPA axis suppression 4. Nociception consists of four stages: Transduction (in&#xD;
      peripheral nociceptors), transmission (via neurons), modulation, and pain perception. The&#xD;
      possible role of steroids on every step of remain unclear; Reduction in inflammation&#xD;
      decreases nociceptors activation (14) , inhibit the expression of collagenase, reduce&#xD;
      pro-inflammatory cytokines, stimulate the synthesis of lipocortin (15), reduction of&#xD;
      peritumoral edema leads to the improvement in analgesia in brain metastases (16) and spinal&#xD;
      cord compression (17) , Decrease of spontaneous discharge &amp; reduce neuropathic pain, Modulate&#xD;
      neural activity and plasticity. There has been little evidence for this in the literature&#xD;
      with cancer-induced pain, nausea, and vomiting, fatigue, cancer-induced anorexia-cachexia,&#xD;
      depressed mood, or poor general well-being and dyspnea. (18)&#xD;
