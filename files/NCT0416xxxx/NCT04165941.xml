  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is being conducted to find out if the safety and tolerability of an experimental&#xD;
      cell therapy is safe to administer to patients with a newly diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme&#xD;
      (GBM) in combination with temozolomide (TMZ).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The cell therapy that is being used in this study is called gene-modified gamma delta T cells&#xD;
      or Drug Resistant Immunotherapy (DRI). Gamma delta T cells are a type of lymphocyte or white&#xD;
      blood cell that may help the immune system to recognize and kill cancer cells. Some&#xD;
      chemotherapy can kill these gamma delta T cells. For the cell therapy being used in this&#xD;
      study, the genes or DNA within these gamma delta T cells are modified so they are resistant&#xD;
      to or may not be affected by chemotherapy. The chemotherapy that is being used in this study&#xD;
      is called temozolomide (TMZ) and can reduce the number of these gamma delta T cells or&#xD;
      lymphocytes. This study will also find out if these modified gamma delta T cells (DRI) are&#xD;
      unaffected by TMZ. The DRI is given in combination with a standard dose of TMZ and is&#xD;
      administered into the brain where the tumor is located.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After subjects are consented in Parts A and B of the study, approximately about 2 tablespoons&#xD;
      of blood will be collected for tests that may provide additional information about subjects T&#xD;
      cells and how they may respond to treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part A Subjects will have a surgical procedure completed that will remove their tumor (called&#xD;
      a surgical resection). They will have a Rickham catheter placed which is a device typically&#xD;
      used to deliver chemotherapy into the brain. The infusion catheter will be placed first prior&#xD;
      to the tumor resection. A sample of tumor tissue will be taken and examined to confirm the&#xD;
      diagnosis of GBM. The diagnosis of GBM must be confirmed prior to beginning Part B.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part B After the surgical resection and on Study Day 1, subjects will return to the study&#xD;
      doctor's office/clinic to undergo a procedure called apheresis. This procedure will separate&#xD;
      out cells called peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). Apheresis is the removal of blood&#xD;
      plasma from the body by collecting your blood and separating the plasma from the PBMCs. These&#xD;
      cells include the gamma delta T cells that will be used to synthesize the DRI γδ T cells.&#xD;
      Once the cells for the DRI γδ T cells are synthesized, they are reintroduced into subject's&#xD;
      brain through the Rickham catheter.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following apheresis and confirmation that the required number of gamma delta T cells were&#xD;
      collected, subjects will begin the recommended or standard of care treatment for newly&#xD;
      diagnosed GBM. This will include 6 weeks of chemotherapy with TMZ and radiation. Subjects&#xD;
      will then have about 4 weeks of no treatment prior to beginning the Part B maintenance phase&#xD;
      of treatment, which includes 6 cycles of TMZ. Depending on which dose level they receive,&#xD;
      they will be administered either 1 injection of the DRI γδ T cells or 3 and these will be&#xD;
      injected through the Rickham catheter.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first 3 subjects will receive a single dose of the DRI γδ T cells at the lowest dose&#xD;
      level. Subjects receiving a single dose of the DRI γδ T cells will be observed for a of&#xD;
      minimum 30 days from the time the first subject is enrolled, followed by a minimum of 7 days&#xD;
      between each additional subject enrolled to allow for evaluation of potential side effects.&#xD;
      If the DRI γδ T cell injection does not cause serious side effects, the second set of 3&#xD;
      subjects will be enrolled. The second set of 3 patients will receive 3 doses of the DRI γδ T&#xD;
      cells. The approximate duration of the study may be up to 15 years, or until disease&#xD;
      progression or subjects withdraw from the study.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Age ≥18 yearsΦ: Because no dosing or adverse event data are currently available on the&#xD;

             Cockcroft-Gault formula); actual body weight must be used for CrCl unless body mass&#xD;
             index (BMI) is &gt; 30 kg/m2, in which case, lean body weight must be used&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have received any therapy for the treatment of GBM prior to inclusion in&#xD;
             Part A and any treatment other than standard of care as described in Part A of this&#xD;
             study including: cellular immunotherapy or gene therapy within 6 weeks prior to&#xD;
             entering the study, surgical resection or alkylating agent chemotherapy within 4 weeks&#xD;
             prior to entering the study, or have received experimental immunotherapy at any time,&#xD;
             and those who have not recovered from adverse events due to therapeutic interventions&#xD;
             administered more than 4 weeks earlier.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients may not be receiving any other investigational agents.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Contraindication to the placement of an intracranial access device (Rickham catheter)&#xD;
             at the time of surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prior history of encephalitis, multiple sclerosis, or other CNS infection&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Required steroid increase within 2 weeks of scheduled DRI γδ T cells administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to ongoing or active&#xD;
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac&#xD;
             arrhythmia, or any othermedical condition that precludes surgery. Also, psychiatric&#xD;
             illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Allergies/hypersensitivity: Aminobisphosphonates such as Zoledronate®, Pamidronate® or&#xD;
             similar&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because the lentiviral- modified γδ T&#xD;
             cells designed to express MGMT cells have an unknown potential for teratogenic or&#xD;
             abortifacient effects. Because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse&#xD;
             events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with these cells,&#xD;
             breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated with the&#xD;
             lentiviral-modified γδ T cells designed to express MGMT. The following birth control&#xD;
             methods are acceptable for this study in women of child- bearing potential:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A Combination of TWO of the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Barrier method of contraception:&#xD;
&#xD;
                    1. condoms (male or female) with or without a spermicidal agent, diaphragm or&#xD;
                       cervical cap with spermicide&#xD;
&#xD;
                    2. IUD&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Hormone-based Contraceptive&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Note: Drug-drug interactions with some ARVs will make hormonal contraception a less&#xD;
             reliable method.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Because patients with immune deficiency will be unable to mount the anticipated immune&#xD;
             response underlying this therapeutic rationale, HIV-seropositive patients are excluded&#xD;
             from this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Some of the contraceptive methods listed above may not prevent the spread of HIV to&#xD;
             other people. Patients should discuss their contraceptive choices with their health&#xD;
             care provider to choose the best way to both prevent pregnancy as required by this&#xD;
             study and to prevent the spread of HIV to any partner(s).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with history of prior organ or bone marrow transplantation are not eligible.&#xD;
