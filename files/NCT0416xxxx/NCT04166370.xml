  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Despite progress in reducing high levels of undernutrition in Bangladesh, gaps in progress&#xD;
      persist. They are particularly acute between rural and urban areas, and between the lowest&#xD;
      wealth quintile and highest. According to the 2016 Bangladesh DHS report, 38% of rural&#xD;
      children under five were stunted compared to 31% of urban children. Forty-nine percent of&#xD;
      children in the lowest wealth quintile were stunted compared to 19% in the highest.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To address these discrepancies and lower the overall level of stunting, research is being&#xD;
      conducted to assist the government of Bangladesh (GoB) in determining the most effective ways&#xD;
      to reduce levels of stunting. The primary objective of this research is to compare the&#xD;
      effectiveness of two multisectoral nutrition intervention packages--one with and without a&#xD;
      conditional cash transfer (CCT) component--to the current standard of practice. A&#xD;
      cluster-randomized controlled trial using mixed methods will be used to evaluate&#xD;
      effectiveness. The two intervention arms are as follows;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Strengthened: Referrals to health services, strengthened health services, and enhanced&#xD;
           social and behavior change communication (SBCC)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Strengthened + CCT: Referrals to health services, strengthened health services, enhanced&#xD;
           SBCC and cash transfers conditional on a mother attending antenatal care (ANC) and&#xD;
           monthly nutrition education SBCC group sessions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study's primary outcome is the percentage of children 6-23 months old receiving a minimum&#xD;
      acceptable diet (MAD), as a proximate determinant for stunting. MAD is defined as the&#xD;
      proportion of children 6-23 months old who receive both the minimum feeding frequency and&#xD;
      minimum dietary diversity for their age group and breastfeeding status. It will be assessed&#xD;
      based on the mother/caregiver report. Secondary outcomes include assessing the knowledge,&#xD;
      attitudes, and practices around breastfeeding, complementary feeding, water sanitation and&#xD;
      hygiene, health services and gender norms. Quantitative surveys, in depth interviews, focus&#xD;
      group discussions, and detailed program monitoring data will be used to assess intervention&#xD;
      strengths, weakness, and cost effectiveness.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      According to the 2014 Bangladesh Demographic and Health Survey (BDHS), 36% of children under&#xD;
      the age of five were stunted, 14% were wasted and 33% were underweight. These results reflect&#xD;
      positive trends in stunting and underweight since 2004, though the rate of decline in&#xD;
      undernutrition slowed from 2011 to 2014. And, despite positive trends, there remain gaps in&#xD;
      key indicators between rural and urban areas and between those in the highest and lowest&#xD;
      wealth quintiles. For instance, according to the BDHS, 38% of rural children under five were&#xD;
      stunted compared to 31% of urban children. The wealth discrepancies are even greater; 49% of&#xD;
      children under five in the lowest wealth quintile were stunted compared to 19% in the highest&#xD;
      quintile.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In 2017, the GoB approved the second National Plan of Action for Nutrition (NPAN 2)&#xD;
      2016-2025. The plan aims to improve nutrition and eliminate malnutrition, with a focus on&#xD;
      children, adolescent girls, and pregnant and lactating women. Specific targets of NPAN 2&#xD;
      include reducing stunting to 25% among children under 5; reducing wasting to less than 8% and&#xD;
      reducing underweight to less than 15%. A significant acceleration in the annual rate of&#xD;
      reduction to 3.3% needs to occur in order to achieve the ambitious Targets by 2025. This&#xD;
      acceleration requires high-level political commitment, a strong policy framework, effective&#xD;
      coordinating mechanisms, adequate resourcing, strong involvement of local civil society&#xD;
      groups, and high impact, cost-effective, multisectoral nutrition interventions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In 2017, USAID awarded FHI 360 the Strengthening Multisectoral Nutrition Programming through&#xD;
      Implementation Science Activity (hereafter referred to as &quot;the Project&quot;) to test and refine&#xD;
      multisectoral nutrition approaches in high stunting areas of Bangladesh. Under the Project,&#xD;
      research is being conducted to assess the effect of different multisectoral nutrition&#xD;
      intervention packages aimed at improving nutrition outcomes that are known to contribute to&#xD;
      overall healthy nutritional status of children under two in Bangladesh. One of the&#xD;
      intervention packages studied by the Project focuses on conditional cash transfers (CCT) for&#xD;
      social protection. The primary objective of this study is to compare the effectiveness of the&#xD;
      current standard of practice with two multisectoral intervention packages--one with and&#xD;
      without a CCT intervention. The two intervention arms are as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Strengthened: Referrals to health services, strengthened health services, and enhanced&#xD;
           social and behavior change communication (SBCC)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Strengthened + CCT: Referrals to health services, strengthened health services, enhanced&#xD;
           SBCC and cash transfers conditional on a mother attending antenatal care (ANC) and&#xD;
           monthly nutrition education SBCC group sessions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A cluster-randomized, controlled trial (cRCT) design will be used to evaluate effectiveness.&#xD;
      The interventions will be delivered at the level of the union, which is a geo-political unit&#xD;
      with an average population of 25,000 people. A total of 60 unions in Khulna and Barishal&#xD;
      Divisions of Bangladesh will be randomly allocated to one of the three study arms: Control&#xD;
      (Current Practice), Strengthened Intervention, or Strengthened + CCT Intervention. Outcome&#xD;
      data will be collected through face-to-face interviews using structured questionnaires with&#xD;
      independently selected random samples of mothers/caregivers of children ages 6 to 23 months&#xD;
      at baseline (pre-intervention) and again at endline. At both timepoints, participants will be&#xD;
      chosen from a sub-sample of the general population who meet the eligibility criteria.&#xD;
      Baseline data will be conducted prior to initiation of study activities. Endline data&#xD;
      collection will be conducted after two years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A process evaluation will be completed between baseline and endline to understand how well&#xD;
      the interventions were implemented, their costs, and ways they may be improved.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The final evaluation analysis of the cRCT to be done at endline, and will focus on comparing&#xD;
      the effect of the intervention on the study outcomes. The study's primary outcome is the&#xD;
      percentage of children 6-23 months old receiving a minimum acceptable diet (MAD), as a&#xD;
      proximate determinant for stunting. MAD is defined as the proportion of children 6-23 months&#xD;
      old who receive both the minimum feeding frequency and minimum dietary diversity for their&#xD;
      age group and breastfeeding status. It will be assessed based on the mother/caregiver report.&#xD;
      Secondary outcomes include assessing the knowledge, attitudes, and practices around&#xD;
      breastfeeding, complementary feeding, water sanitation and hygiene, health services and&#xD;
      gender norms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is anticipated an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) approach will be used for a post-only&#xD;
      comparison of study arms with possible adjustment for baseline levels in an aggregate manner&#xD;
      (note: aggregation for baseline adjustment will be needed given the independent samples&#xD;
      selected at each time point). Generalized mixed models to compare the study groups and adjust&#xD;
      for clustering at the union level will be used. A logit link will be used for the primary&#xD;
      outcome (i.e., minimum acceptable diet) as it is a dichotomous outcome, while other link&#xD;
      functions will be used for other outcomes as appropriate. It is hypothesized that the&#xD;
      intervention arm with the enhanced SBCC will be superior to standard practice. It is further&#xD;
      hypothesized that adding CCT along with the enhanced SBCC will produce an even greater&#xD;
      effect. These pairwise comparisons will be tested using the model parameter estimates.&#xD;

    <description>Will include all components of the strengthened intervention and participants will receive monthly cash transfers, which is about 25% of monthly consumption expenditure among poor rural households in Bangladesh. Cash transfers will begin when a woman enrolls (at any time during her pregnancy or until 2 months after giving birth). The monthly transfer will continue until a child is 12 months of age, thereby supporting mothers during the critical period of complementary food introduction. The transfer is contingent on having had a minimum of 4 ANC visits and monthly participation in mother's group SBCC sessions.</description>
