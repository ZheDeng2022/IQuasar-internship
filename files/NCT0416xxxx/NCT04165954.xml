  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      -  Background In emotional regulation, the patient remembers an emotional situation,&#xD;
           focuses his attention on his physical sensations when he relives a recent emotion, and&#xD;
           let evolve his sensations.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Method Evaluate the relevance of this method by an interventional study, in a pre-post&#xD;
           mono group, on patients suffering from phobia.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Objective The investigators aim to validate the effectiveness of this emotional&#xD;
           regulation method and compare its results with that of conventional methods. Sessions&#xD;
           are individual and repeated until the disappearance of phobic fear.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The present study may contribute to propose a new possibility to treat phobias in a simple&#xD;
      and fast way.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Between 2003 and 2006, the investigators conducted an exploratory, prospective and&#xD;
      comparative research study, taking each person as their own control, to evaluate the benefits&#xD;
      of the type of emotional regulation developed by the Tipi association on a population&#xD;
      suffering from phobias.&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Participants Phobias can be categorized by type, as defined in the DSM IV, the standard&#xD;
      reference during the study period (American Psychiatriy Association, 2000) : agoraphobias,&#xD;
      social phobias, specific situational phobias (claustrophobia, transport phobia), phobias&#xD;
      linked to the natural environment (heights, water, fire), to animals (spiders, snakes,&#xD;
      amphibians, tentacled shellfish) and other types of specific phobias (fear of physical&#xD;
      contact, being dirtied, contaminated, vomiting), phobia of blood - injections - medical&#xD;
      techniques - accidents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators aim to conduct a prior and systematic verification with each person to&#xD;
      confirm that their fears were phobias as defined in the DSM IV (American Psychiatriy&#xD;
      Association, 2000). The phobia must be diagnosed by a doctor or psychiatrist. Each people&#xD;
      must provide a medical certificate that evidenced the diagnosis in writing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All people must read an information form on &quot;Understanding your emotions&quot; All participants&#xD;
      must have suffered from their phobias for a long time. They have to describe their treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Everybody in the study population have to provide a short-written report on the effects of&#xD;
      the session(s) 1 week, 1 month, 3 months and 12 months after the session.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Intervention (see below)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Follow-up During the one-year follow-up period, the patient was requested to send a&#xD;
           written self-assessment of his situation and the change and/or disappearance of his&#xD;
           phobia. If the investigators didn't receive the person's assessment, the investigators&#xD;
           followed-up with a mail and a phone call.&#xD;
