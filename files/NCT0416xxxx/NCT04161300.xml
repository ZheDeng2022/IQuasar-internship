      The main objective of the present study was to evaluate whether FR massage is effective in&#xD;
      improving dynamic balance, flexibility and dynamic strength after intense exercise recovery&#xD;

      trial. Amateur athletes will be recruited from two athletic clubs. Participants will be&#xD;
      randomizing and allocating into three non-balanced groups through a computer software by an&#xD;
      external assistant who will be blinding to the study objectives: FR group (n = 18), OMPT&#xD;
      group (n = 15) and control group (CG) (n = 14). The intervention period will be lasting one&#xD;

      Introduction Foam rolling (FR) is a form of self-massage in which the targeted musculature is&#xD;
      rolled and compressed using a FR. In the field of physical therapy that has been shown to&#xD;
      produce a reduced feeling of fatigue in healthy athletes12 as well as hypoalgesic effects in&#xD;
      subjects with delayed-onset muscle soreness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently, self-massage through FR is commonly used in the sports field. The reason for this&#xD;
      is that it has been suggested that it could have the positive effects traditionally&#xD;
      associated with orthopedic manual physical therapy (OMPT), That is why despite the widespread&#xD;
      use of FR massage in the field of muscle recovery in athletes, there is a lack of scientific&#xD;
      literature about its effectiveness compared to OMPT that can justify its use. Therefore, the&#xD;
      main objective of the present study was to evaluate whether FR massage is effective in&#xD;
      improving dynamic balance, flexibility and dynamic strength after intense exercise recovery&#xD;
      compared to OMPT protocol or a control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods The present study was a randomized controlled trial. Participants Amateur athletes&#xD;
      will be recruited from two athletic clubs. The inclusion criteria will be as follows: (a)&#xD;
      male and female amateur athletes aged 18 to 30 years. The exclusion criteria: (a) previous&#xD;
      surgery of the locomotor system in lower limbs; (b) musculoskeletal injuries in any part of&#xD;
      the body that prevent practicing sports; (c) understanding or communication difficulties; and&#xD;
      (d) insufficient fluency in the Spanish language to follow measurement instructions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Informed written consent will be obtaining from all the participants prior to inclusion. All&#xD;
      the participants will be explaining the study procedures, which will be design according to&#xD;
      the ethical standards of the Helsinki Declaration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedure Participants will be randomizing and allocating into three non-balanced groups&#xD;
      through a computer software by an external assistant who will be blinding to the study&#xD;
      objectives: FR group (n = 18), OMPT group (n = 15) and control group (CG) (n = 14). The&#xD;
      intervention period will be lasting one day (1 session).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participant assessment will be perform twice: prior to the study (pre-intervention) and&#xD;
      immediately after finishing the intervention (post-intervention).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interventions FR group. FR auto-massage will place the foam roller between their ischial&#xD;
      tuberosity and a hard surface (i.e., the floor) with their legs held in an extended position,&#xD;
      keeping their ankles relaxed and oriented upward. For FR in the lumbar region, participants&#xD;
      use their weight to slide the FR through the erector of the lumbar and thoracic spine. The&#xD;
      total approximate duration will be about 10-15 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OMPT group. Based on the protocol used by Espí-López et al.: a) Unspecific and bilateral&#xD;
      lumbar thrust (L5-S1), one of each side were performed; b) Hip joint decompression,&#xD;
      performing 25 repetitions c) Hip rotator stretch with hip and knee flexion, 15 repetitions;&#xD;
      d) Femorotibial decompression, 25 reps. e) Quadriceps femoral muscle compression and&#xD;
      traction, 25 repetitions; f) Opening of the internal and external femorotibial interline, 15&#xD;
      repetition; g) Ankle decompression, 3 repetitions; h) Posteroanterior and anteroposterior&#xD;
      mobilization of head and base of fibula, 25 repetitions. The total duration will be&#xD;
      approximately 10-15 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CG. The CG did not receive any intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary outcomes: Physical functional variables Lumbar flexibility. Modified Schober test&#xD;
      (MMST). The MMST was designed to assess the mobility of the entire lower back, so the MMST&#xD;
      was used to measure lumbar flexion before and after FR and TM interventions. The examiner&#xD;
      will place his thumbs on the lower margin of the posterior-upper iliac spine (lower reference&#xD;
      point) and a pen mark was made. While the examiner held the tape against the subject's skin,&#xD;
      another signal was marked 15 cm above the first (upper reference point). Each subject was&#xD;
      then asked to perform an active flexion of the entire trunk and the distance between the two&#xD;
      points will be measuring and then the subject return to his initial position. The difference&#xD;
      between the initial distance and the new bending measurements will be take.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hip flexion. by the passive straight leg raise (SLR). Passive SLR will be conducting using a&#xD;
      procedure previously described by Hopper et al. A Richards splint and an ankle foot orthosis&#xD;
      were applied to the left leg to maintain the knee in full extension and the ankle at a&#xD;
      neutral plantar angle. An inclinometer will be attaching to a belt, which will place around&#xD;
      the pelvis at the level of the anterior superior iliac spine (Baseline Bubble Inclinometer.&#xD;
      Fabrication Enterprises, PO Box, 1500 White Plains, NY 10602, USA). A second inclinometer&#xD;
      will be then attaching to the Richards splint at the level of the knee joint line. The mean&#xD;
      of 3 measures will be using for analysis. During the test, the participants are positioned&#xD;
      with their hands on the abdomen, cervical spine in a neutral position and eyes closed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dynamic balance using the Star Excursion Balance Test (SEBT). The SEBT is a dynamic test that&#xD;
      requires strength, flexibility, and proprioception. The goal of the SEBT is to maintain&#xD;
      single-leg stance while reaching as far as possible with the contralateral leg. Subjects are&#xD;
      instructed to stand with both feet positioned inside the boundaries of the starting box. The&#xD;
      test initiates when the subject begins to reach in one of the four diagonal directions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Standing Jump. Subjects are placed their feet shoulder-width apart and toes placed in a line&#xD;
      on the floor. The subjects then made a horizontal leap forward, where they were allowed the&#xD;
      arms to swing, and it will be done along the length of a tape measure that was fixed to the&#xD;
      ground. The subjects had to stick to the ground in the landing phase, preventing any&#xD;
      additional movement of the feet when landing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The jumped distance will be calculating as the distance from the jump initiation line to the&#xD;
      heel of the back foot. The best of three attempts was recorded, with a recovery of 60 seconds&#xD;
      between attempts. All distances will be measuring with an accuracy of 0.01 meters.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcome:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Impression of Change (CGI). Patient Global Impression of Change Scale (PGIOCS) that evaluates&#xD;
      the change perceived by the subject after a treatment. This scale has 7 affirmations to&#xD;
      choose from (I have improved a lot, quite, a little, I am the same, I have worsened a little,&#xD;
      a lot or a lot) and a pain analogue scale of 10 cm.&#xD;
