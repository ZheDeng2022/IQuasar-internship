  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Improving communication is foundational to improving patient safety. Electronic health&#xD;
      records (EHRs) can improve communication, but also introduce unique vulnerabilities. Failure&#xD;
      to follow-up abnormal test results (missed results) is a key preventable factor in diagnosis&#xD;
      and treatment delays in the VHA and often involves EHR-based communication breakdowns.&#xD;
      Effective methods are needed to detect diagnostic delays and intervene appropriately. Manual&#xD;
      techniques to detect care delays, such as spontaneous reporting and random chart reviews,&#xD;
      have limited effectiveness, due in part to bias and lack of provider awareness of delays.&#xD;
      They are also inefficient and cost-prohibitive when applied to large numbers of patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Diagnostic errors are considered harder to tackle, in part because they are difficult to&#xD;
      measure. Rigorous measurement of diagnostic safety is essential and should be prioritized&#xD;
      given the increasing amount of electronically available data. To create an effective&#xD;
      measurement and learning program researchers must (1) ensure teams know how to take&#xD;
      actionable steps on data and have assistance in doing so and (2) prioritize diagnostic safety&#xD;
      at the organizational level by securing commitment from local VA leadership and clinical&#xD;
      operations personnel. This will ensure that safety measurement will translate into action.&#xD;
      The proposed study focuses on creating a novel program to develop and evaluate multifaceted&#xD;
      socio-technical tools and strategies to help prevent, detect, mitigate, and ameliorate&#xD;
      breakdowns in EHR-based communication that often lead to &quot;missed&quot; test results in the VHA.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to develop and evaluate a new program for surveillance and&#xD;
      improvement of test results-related diagnostic safety. The investigators will use a&#xD;
      multifaceted measurement approach, the Virtual Breakthrough Series (VBTS) model, to account&#xD;
      for processes of care and work systems issues as well as outcomes and implement change.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is for Aim 2 of the study which was approved under IRB Protocol Number: H-45450. This&#xD;
      study will implement the Change Package which was developed in the research team's recent&#xD;
      work (Aim1, prior IRB Protocol Number: H-43661 from October 2018 - September 2019) via&#xD;
      Virtual Breakthrough Series using a stepped-wedge cluster-randomized control trial. The study&#xD;
      design involves random and sequential crossover of clusters from control to intervention&#xD;
      until all clusters are exposed. A Change Package is a catalogue of evidence-based practices,&#xD;
      change concepts, and action steps/strategies that help guide improvement efforts. VBTS&#xD;
      involves monthly learning sessions where participants are provided with education/review of a&#xD;
      specific component of a Change Package along with reviewing de-identified data, and having a&#xD;
      facilitated discussion about successes, challenges, and implementation progress related to&#xD;
      needed changes. The intervention will consist of coached implementation of the SAFER Change&#xD;
      Package using a VBTS Collaborative, plus automated near real-time surveillance data on&#xD;
      potentially missed test results through monthly data extraction within the Corporate Data&#xD;
      Warehouse (CDW) platform.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study's outcome measures will be the rate of missed test results, determined through&#xD;
      random manual medical record review conducted nationally as part of the VHA&#xD;
      performance-measurement system, known as the External Peer Review Program (EPRP) which has&#xD;
      been collecting facility-level data on timeliness of communication of test results to&#xD;
      patients within the time periods specified by VHA Directive 1088, as well as automated&#xD;
      indicators (Triggers) of missed test results. Electronic surveillance will be made possible&#xD;
      through the use of the research team's trigger algorithms which will determine the number of&#xD;
      patients potentially lost to follow-up for the specified condition based on a previously&#xD;
      validated timeframe. The triggers use the national EHR data warehouse (VINCI/CDW) to identify&#xD;
      patients at risk for delays or patients who may have fallen through the cracks. For data&#xD;
      surveillance, the investigators will apply five triggers to the medical record data contained&#xD;
      within the CDW for the participating facilities during the Intervention Phase along with&#xD;
      evaluating EPRP data. The research team hypothesizes there will be fewer missed test results&#xD;
      in participating sites during the SAFER TRACKS Intervention as compared to during the&#xD;
      pre-intervention period.&#xD;
