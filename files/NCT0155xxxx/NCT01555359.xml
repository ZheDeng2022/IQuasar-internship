  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Autologous hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) is a treatment strategy used as advanced&#xD;
      line therapy for different malignancies, mainly hematological. Its main advantage lies in the&#xD;
      ability to provide hematologic and immune rescue after high dose chemotherapy therapy. The&#xD;
      first requirement of a successful transplantation is recruitment of sufficient amount of&#xD;
      cells. This is achieved by mobilizing CD34+ stem cells from the bone marrow to the peripheral&#xD;
      blood, by G-CSF priming, and then harvesting the cells from the peripheral blood at the right&#xD;
      timing by means of apheresis. Currently, the decision on the optimal collection timing is&#xD;
      based on the pre-collection CD34 cells blood concentrations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators goal is to investigate whether telomerase, the telomere elongation enzyme,&#xD;
      which constitutionally and solely expressed in progenitor cells, is correlated with&#xD;
      collection and post HCT engraftment characteristics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will collect blood from patients when starting GCSF and on the day of&#xD;
      planned apheresis. Pearson correlation test will be used to correlate between telomerase&#xD;
      activity in the samples and with collection and engraftment characteristics.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Autologous hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) has revolutionized the curative approach&#xD;
      to a number of malignancies by providing hematopoietic and immune rescue after high dose&#xD;
      cytoreductive therapy. In cases of residual disease, patients are usually treated with&#xD;
      chemotherapy to repress the disease, thereafter G-CSF injections are given serially to&#xD;
      encourage stem cell proliferation in the bone marrow and mobilization of the stem/progenitor&#xD;
      cells to the peripheral blood. Another approach, usually utilizes in myeloma patients is the&#xD;
      administration of G-CSF in steady state (without administration of chemotherapy) and&#xD;
      consequently collection of the CD34+ cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The minimum number of CD34+ cells threshold requires for HCT is currently defined as 2 x&#xD;
      10^6/kg. However, the optimal dose in terms of engraftment may be even higher (&gt;5x10^6/kg),&#xD;
      especially when platelet recovery is considered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In clinical practice, the right timing for collection is decided upon measurement of CD34, a&#xD;
      membrane glycoprotein of progenitors and stem-cells. CD34 levels are measured in the expected&#xD;
      maximal effect of the G-CSF priming, and accordingly the collection is scheduled.&#xD;
      Practically, if the circulating CD34+cell count is ≥20/μL, 90% of collections performed the&#xD;
      following day would be expected to yield ≥2.0x106 CD34+cells/kg (Gordon, BMT 1997). However,&#xD;
      in cases higher doses of CD34+ cells are required (e.g. for tandem HCT), CD34+ threshold may&#xD;
      not be sufficient to determined collection yield.&#xD;
&#xD;
      G-CSF based mobilization regimens have a 5-30% failure rate amongst patients, however in&#xD;
      patients with risk factors, up to 60% of the patients are failed to mobilize. Poor&#xD;
      mobilization has significant consequences for the patient with potential loss of&#xD;
      transplantation as a treatment option. Repeated attempts at mobilization increase resource&#xD;
      utilization, morbidity and patient inconvenience. Therefore attempts to identify patients who&#xD;
      would mobilize poorly are of clinical significance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Human telomerase, a unique ribonucleoprotein complex, is inactive in normal somatic cells but&#xD;
      present in high levels in more than 90% of all malignancies. The enzyme, synthesize new&#xD;
      telomeric repeats at the 3' ends of chromosomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As oppose to other normal cells, stem cells are unique in that they carry active telomerase&#xD;
      which provides them with longer life span. Previous study from our lab showed that in&#xD;
      patients and healthy donors, the administration of GCSF was associated with a 14th fold&#xD;
      increase of telomerase activity levels in peripheral blood CD34+ cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Working hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Telomerase activity in mobilized stem cells is correlated with both the absolute number of&#xD;
      the collected cells and with the quality of the future engraftment after high dose therapy&#xD;
      and HCT&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To investigate the correlation between telomerase activity of CD34+ cells in the day of&#xD;
           collection and the total number of collected CD34+ cells in a cohort of 50 patients&#xD;
           undergoing stem cells mobilization and collection.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To explore the association between telomerase activity of CD34+ cells and the&#xD;
           engraftment characteristics (time to platelets&gt;50000/microL, time to&#xD;
           platelets&gt;150000/microL, time to neutrophils&gt;500/microL, time to&#xD;
           neutrophil&gt;2000/microL).&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To develop an algorithm based on CD34+ cells levels and CD34+ telomerase activity, both&#xD;
           measured on the day of collection, that can serve as predictor for the total number of&#xD;
           CD34+ cells to be collected.&#xD;
