      This is a phase II open label fixed dose study in subjects with advanced, metastatic, or&#xD;
      refractory endometrial or ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer with PI3&#xD;
      kinase pathway activation as demonstrated by PIK3CA gene mutation, PTEN gene mutation, or&#xD;
      PTEN null/low protein expression.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Given the mechanisms of action and the safety profiles and tolerability of BKM120&#xD;
      (NVP-BKM120), the use of this agent may provide benefit to patients with endometrial and&#xD;
      ovarian cancer. Endometrial and ovarian cancer are leading causes of cancer death in women&#xD;
      and there are limited treatment options for those with metastatic or refractory disease.&#xD;
      Alterations of the PI3K/PTEN/Akt pathway have been identified in many cancers, including&#xD;
      endometrial and ovarian cancers. Tumors with PI3K mutations have demonstrated sensitivity to&#xD;
      this compound therefore justifying use of this agent in subjects with endometrial or ovarian,&#xD;
      fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer. Therefore use of this agent in cancer patients&#xD;
      with PI3 kinase pathway activation offers a reasonable treatment option.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be initially treated with single agent BKM120 for 28 days at a dose of 100mg&#xD;
      per day. CT response will be adjudged post BKM120 therapy at day 28. If there is no&#xD;
      significant progression on CT scan, patients will be continued on BKM120 for another two&#xD;
      cycles (28 days per cycle [+/- 3 days]). Response assessments will then be done at that time&#xD;
      (after the third 28 day cycle). If there is no significant progression on CT scan, then the&#xD;
      patients will continue BKM120 with response assessments using standard CT criteria every two&#xD;
      cycles (28 days per cycle [+/- 3 days]) thereafter.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If disease progression is observed, patient will have completed the study. Patient will be&#xD;
      seen within 30 days for end of treatment visit.&#xD;

             employing an effective method of birth control. Double barrier contraceptives must be&#xD;
             used through the trial by both sexes. Oral, implantable, or injectable contraceptives&#xD;
             may be affected by cytochrome P450 interactions, and are therefore not considered&#xD;
             effective for this study. Women of child-bearing potential, defined as sexually mature&#xD;
             women who have not undergone a hysterectomy or who have not been naturally&#xD;
             postmenopausal for at least 12 consecutive months (i.e., who has had menses any time&#xD;
             in the preceding 12 consecutive months), must have a negative serum pregnancy test ≤&#xD;
             72 hours prior to initiating treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;

                  clinical profile (e.g. age appropriate, history of vasomotor symptoms) or six&#xD;
                  months of spontaneous amenorrhea with serum FSH levels &gt; 40 mIU/mL and estradiol&#xD;
                  &lt; 20 pg/mL or have had surgical bilateral oophorectomy (with or without&#xD;
                  hysterectomy) at least six weeks ago. In the case of oophorectomy alone, only&#xD;
                  when the reproductive status of the woman has been confirmed by follow up hormone&#xD;
                  level assessment is she considered not of child bearing potential.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Women of child-bearing potential, defined as all women physiologically capable of&#xD;
                  becoming pregnant, must use highly effective contraception during the treatment&#xD;
                  for 5 T1/2 (8 days) after stopping treatment and for additional 12 weeks (3&#xD;
                  months in total after study drug discontinuation). The highly effective&#xD;
                  contraception is defined as either:&#xD;
&#xD;
                    1. True abstinence: When this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle&#xD;
                       of the subject. Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation,&#xD;
                       symptothermal, post-ovulation methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable&#xD;
                       methods of contraception.&#xD;
&#xD;
                    2. Sterilization: have had surgical bilateral oophorectomy (with or without&#xD;
                       hysterectomy) or tubal ligation at least six weeks ago. In case of&#xD;
                       oophorectomy alone, only when the reproductive status of the woman has been&#xD;
                       confirmed by follow up hormone level assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
                    3. Male partner sterilization (with the appropriate post-vasectomy&#xD;
                       documentation of the absence of sperm in the ejaculate). For female subjects&#xD;
                       on the study, the vasectomised male partner should be the sole partner for&#xD;
                       that patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
                    4. Use of a combination of any two of the following (a+b):&#xD;
&#xD;
                         -  Placement of an intrauterine device (IUD) or intrauterine system (IUS)&#xD;
&#xD;
                         -  Barrier methods of contraception: Condom or Occlusive cap (diaphragm or&#xD;
                            cervical/vault caps) with spermicidal foam/gel/film/cream/vaginal&#xD;
                            suppository&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Oral contraception, injected or implanted hormonal methods are not allowed as&#xD;
                  BKM120 potentially decreases the effectiveness of hormonal contraceptives.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Fertile males, defined as all males physiologically capable of conceiving&#xD;
                  offspring must use condom during treatment, for 5 T1/2 (8 days) after stopping&#xD;
                  treatment and for additional 12 weeks (3 months in total after study drug&#xD;
                  discontinuation) and should not father a child in this period.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Known diagnosis of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of another malignancy within 3 years, except cured basal cell carcinoma of the&#xD;
