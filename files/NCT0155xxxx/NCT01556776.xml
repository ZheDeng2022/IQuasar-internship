      CLLM1 is a phase 3, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group&#xD;
      study that compares the efficacy and safety of oral lenalidomide maintenance therapy to that&#xD;
      of placebo maintenance therapy in high-risk subjects with Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL)&#xD;
      who have achieved at least a partial response (PR) and either:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  MRD levels of ≥ 10-2 or&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  MRD levels of ≥ 10-4 - &lt; 10-2 combined with at least one of the following factors:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  an unmutated IGHV-status&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  17p-deletion or&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  TP53 mutation after first line therapy with FCR, FR, BR or FC (in case of of&#xD;
                contraindications to receive Rituximab).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      CLLM1 is a phase 3 multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group&#xD;
      study designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of lenalidomide administered as&#xD;
      maintenance treatment to subjects with CLL who have responded to first-line therapy&#xD;
      (induction) achieving a response of at least PR and are at high risk of early progression.&#xD;
      This study will compare the efficacy of lenalidomide maintenance treatment versus placebo at&#xD;
      prolonging progression free survival (PFS); and as secondary endpoints assess overall&#xD;
      survival, the safety of lenalidomide treatment and evaluate Minimal residual disease (MRD)&#xD;
      kinetics in peripheral blood whilst subjects are on maintenance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although maintenance therapy has been established in recent years for the treatment of a&#xD;
      subset of subjects with Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma (NHL), it is a novel concept in the management&#xD;
      of CLL. It is not regularly used and only a limited number of small studies have been&#xD;
      conducted evaluating consolidation/maintenance therapy for limited periods of time with&#xD;
      alemtuzumab or rituximab. Based on the limited amount of available data, it appears that&#xD;
      maintenance therapy may improve the quality of remission in CLL subjects and prolong&#xD;
      progression-free survival (PFS). A large phase 3 trial investigating lenalidomide as&#xD;
      maintenance following response to second line therapy is ongoing. However, a large&#xD;
      well-controlled study has not been conducted to investigate the beneficial effect of&#xD;
      maintenance therapy following front line therapy; specifically in subjects with aggressive&#xD;
      disease. This phase 3 study will evaluate whether lenalidomide maintenance therapy will&#xD;
      prolong PFS in CLL subjects with a high risk of early progression following first line&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
