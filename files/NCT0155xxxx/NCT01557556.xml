      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Stressful situations often cause tobacco cravings. These cravings can make it very&#xD;
      difficult for smokers who are trying to quit. Research has shown that craving may involve&#xD;
      hormone pathways in the brain. The anti-anxiety drug pexacerfont acts on these hormone&#xD;
      pathways. Researchers want to see if pexacerfont can act on the brain and lessen&#xD;
      stress-related tobacco cravings in smokers who are trying to quit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To test the effects of pexacerfont on tobacco craving in smokers who want to quit smoking.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Smokers between 18 to 55 years of age who are trying to quit. (Participants must have&#xD;
      smoked at least 10 cigarettes per day for at least 1 year.)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be screened with a physical exam and medical history.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be assigned to take either pexacerfont or a placebo. They will take&#xD;
           three pills every morning for the first 7 days, then one pill every morning for 23 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  At the first visit, participants will provide blood and urine samples. They will then be&#xD;
           asked to prepare a 5-minute speech and give it to the study researchers. They will also&#xD;
           be asked to do mental math problems for another 5 minutes. During these tests, blood&#xD;
           pressure, heart rate, sweating, and skin temperature will be measured. Participants will&#xD;
           fill out questionnaires about stress levels, tobacco cravings, and personal experiences.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will take the study pills for 30 days. Before the 2-week point,&#xD;
           participants will be asked to try to quit smoking for 2 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will have four study visits. These visits will involve brain imaging scans&#xD;
           and emotional stress tests. Tobacco cravings and other stress levels will be measured at&#xD;
           each study. Blood and urine samples may be collected at these studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will have follow-up visits and phone calls for up to 6 months after the end&#xD;
           of the study visits.&#xD;

      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To evaluate pexacerfont, an orally available, brain-penetrant selective CRF1 antagonist, for&#xD;
      its ability to modulate emotional and motivational processes in daily smokers who are seeking&#xD;
      to quit smoking.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population:&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will collect evaluable data from up to 60 adult, greater than or equal to 10 cigarettes&#xD;
      per day smokers who smoke their first cigarette within one hour of waking as reported on the&#xD;
      Fagerstrom Test of Nicotine Dependence (FTND) and wish to quit smoking.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be randomly assigned to one of two groups to receive 30 days of oral&#xD;
      pexacerfont (300 mg/day loading dose for 7 days, followed by 100 mg/day maintenance dose for&#xD;
      23 days) or matching placebo under double-blind conditions. On Day 15 and 16, subjects will&#xD;
      have two days of testing to evaluate reactivity to stressful/neutral stimuli with and without&#xD;
      the presence of smoking cues. Reactivity will be tested in terms of physiological parameters,&#xD;
      subjective reports, nicotine reinforcemen, smoking resistance paradigms and functional&#xD;
      Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) Blood Oxygen Level Dependent (BOLD) signal at rest and in&#xD;
      response to stress/cue-related tasks. In addition, during the last 14 days of study drug&#xD;
      administration, subjects will attempt to stop smoking. Daily assessments of smoking behavior&#xD;
      will be obtained. Finally, on days 26 and 27, participants will again have two days of&#xD;
      testing to evaluate reactivity to stressful/neutral stimuli. Reactivity will be tested in&#xD;
      terms of physiological parameters, subjective reports, cue reactivity paradigms and&#xD;
      functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) Blood Oxygen Level Dependent (BOLD) signal at&#xD;
      rest and in response to stress/cue-related tasks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome measures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome measures in laboratory sessions will include nicotine reinforcement, latency to lapse&#xD;
      in a smoking resistance paradigm, subjective ratings of stress, mood, and tobacco craving,&#xD;
      autonomic responses (galvanic skin response, heart rate, and blood pressure), endocrine&#xD;
      responses (salivary cortisol and salivary (alpha) amylase, a measure of endogenous adrenergic&#xD;
      activity during stress), and fMRI BOLD signal at rest and in response to stress/cue-related&#xD;
      tasks. Outcome measures during the quit attempt will include, change in consumption, number&#xD;
      of lapses, and latency to lapse.&#xD;

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Daily smokers for at least one year; smoke at least 10 cigarettes per day; smoke first&#xD;
        cigarette of day within one hour of waking as recorded on Fagerstrom Test of Nicotine&#xD;
        Dependence (FTND).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Currently wish to quit smoking. Stage of Change (Prochaska and DiClemente, 1983) will be&#xD;
        assessed for each participant and those who are in the contemplation and planning stages&#xD;
        will be included in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Urinary continine level greater than or equal to 100 ng/ml (NicAlert reading greater than&#xD;
        or equal to 3) at screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Men and women, ages 18 to 55 years. Justification: Many cognitive processes change with&#xD;
        age. In addition, the risk of difficult-to-detect medical abnormalities such as silent&#xD;
        cerebral infarcts increases with age. As this study includes fMRI scanning, older&#xD;
        individuals, defined as those over 55, will be excluded as these age-related abnormalities&#xD;
        may affect quality of imaging data.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Women of childbearing potential must have a negative serum or urine pregnancy test (minimum&#xD;
        sensitivity 25 IU/L or equivalent units of HCG) within 72 hours prior to the start of study&#xD;
        drug, and agree to use an adequate method of contraception to avoid pregnancy from study&#xD;
        entry to 6 months following the last dose of study drug. Women of childbearing potential&#xD;
        include any female who has experienced menarche and who has not undergone successful&#xD;
        surgical sterilization (hysterectomy, bilateral tubal ligation, or bilateral oophorectomy)&#xD;
        or is not postmenopausal. Adequate methods of contraception for sexually active women are&#xD;
        having a male sexual partner(s) who is surgically sterilized prior to inclusion; having a&#xD;
        sexual partner(s) who is/are exclusively female; using oral contraceptives (either combined&#xD;
        or progestrogen only) with a single-barrier method of contraception consisting of&#xD;
        spermicide and condom or diaphragm; using double-barrier contraception, specifically, a&#xD;
        condom plus spermicide and a female diaphragm or cervical cap; or using an approved&#xD;
        intrauterine device (IUD) with established efficacy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Men, unless surgically sterilized (vasectomy with documentation of azoospermia), must agree&#xD;
        to practice abstinence or use barrier contraception with spermacide (unless their partner&#xD;
        has been surgically sterilized or is infertile), and not donate sperm, during drug&#xD;
        administration and for a period of 6 months after the last dose of randomized treatment.&#xD;

        physically incompatible with the machine dimensions.&lt;TAB&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;

        the administration of last dose of study drug.&#xD;
