  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Understanding what treatments may facilitate perioperative care of Veterans with&#xD;
      posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is of great importance to the U.S. health care system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with PTSD are characterized by elevated central nervous system catecholamine&#xD;
      concentrations and exaggerated and prolonged adrenergic responses to stress stimuli. At&#xD;
      present, there are no data on the effects of perioperative beta blocker therapy in patients&#xD;
      with PTSD, despite the rising significance of PTSD in Veteran populations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This prospective, double-blind study proposes to randomize 150 Veterans with PTSD scheduled&#xD;
      for orthopedic, thoracic or vascular surgery at the San Francisco VA Medical Center to either&#xD;
      a 14-day course of propranolol or placebo. This study will then follow these Veterans for a&#xD;
      one-year period to evaluate the effects of the intervention on Veterans' surgical outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that patients with PTSD randomized to the propranolol group&#xD;
      will demonstrate a reduced incidence of perioperative and postoperative morbidity and&#xD;
      mortality.&#xD;
