      Caesarean delivery under general anaesthesia (GA) carries nowadays still 25% risk of&#xD;
      insufficient depth of anaesthesia in a time before the fetus delivery. The reason is the lack&#xD;
      of opioid administration. Opioids easily cross placental barrier and negatively influence&#xD;
      newborn postpartum adaptation by respiratory depression. Introduction to GA is thus&#xD;
      accompanied by exaggerated autonomic stress reaction with hypertension and tachycardia. The&#xD;
      use of ultra-short acting opioid remifentanil should suppress stress response in mother&#xD;
      without increasing the risk for newborn. There are only a few clinical data available. This&#xD;
      study will be the first one systematically studying the influence of remifentanil in pregnant&#xD;
      women with hypertension on hemodynamic stability and newborns safety. This study will also&#xD;
      identify potential pharmacogenetic factors of individual variability in remifentanil response&#xD;
      with respect of drug efficacy and safety in mother and newborn.&#xD;

      INTRODUCTION Even nowadays there is still a significant risk of insufficient depth of&#xD;
      anesthesia during Cesarean delivery (CD) under general anesthesia (GA). The main reason in&#xD;
      comparison to other surgeries is the lack of opioid administration due to risk of newborn&#xD;
      respiratory depression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Opioids easily cross the placental barrier to the fetus circulation and may cause depression&#xD;
      of respiration and deteriorate the overall newborns postpartum adaptation. This presents the&#xD;
      main reason why according to contemporary recommendation is the use of opioids in CD&#xD;
      restricted until the time of fetus delivery, and are given as far as after the navel wort&#xD;
      ligation. Not to cause any depression of the newborn the premedication to GA is usually also&#xD;
      omitted. The beginning of GA in common surgical operation is usually accompanied by the&#xD;
      decrease in systemic blood pressure (BP) and heart rate (HR). However, in CD the&#xD;
      investigators face the increase of BP and HR due to stress reaction of mother during the&#xD;
      period before the fetus delivery and before full anesthesia application, including opioids.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Generally, insufficient depth of anesthesia (assessed by patient's recollection) is reported&#xD;
      in less than 1% of cases, but increases for up to 50% in GA during CD. However, this&#xD;
      appraisal marginalized much more frequent cases when an insufficient depth of GA is&#xD;
      accompanied by exaggerated autonomic reaction to the pain, especially the increase in&#xD;
      systemic BP and heart rate as a reaction to the egestion of catecholamines, while total&#xD;
      amnesia of the surgery is retained. In CD such type of anesthesia insufficiency was reported&#xD;
      in 12-26% of patients! Current trend in CD anesthesia unequivocally prefers the use of&#xD;
      regional techniques; GA remains indicated for emergency situations mainly and in those cases&#xD;
      the stress reaction of mother tends to be much higher than in elective procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An independent remarkable risk factor to the pregnant women is the hypertension, both chronic&#xD;
      and gestational including preeclampsia. This condition of preoperatively mostly hardly and&#xD;
      insufficiently controlled hypertension may get dramatically worse during the first phase of&#xD;
      CD, when blood pressure due to uncontrolled stress reaction enormously rises and elevates&#xD;
      intracranial pressure with high risk of hemorrhagic stroke - a life threatening complication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Unfortunately there are only a few possibilities how to influence mother's stress response to&#xD;
      intubation and laparotomy without increasing the risk of newborn depression. In absence of&#xD;
      anesthetics not crossing placental barrier, the only possibility is the use of ultra-short&#xD;
      acting anesthetics which should be eliminated from fetus circulation before his delivery. An&#xD;
      important role might play remifentanil - µ-receptor agonist with rapid onset and ultra-short&#xD;
      activity (biological half-life 3-10 min.). It's major advantage, beside fast onset, is also&#xD;
      prompt and organs independent elimination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HYPOTHESIS Bolus administration of an ultra-short acting synthetic µ-opioid receptor agonist,&#xD;
      remifentanil, in mothers with hypertension/preeclampsia before induction of general&#xD;
      anesthesia attenuates egestion of stress catecholamines and development of stress autonomic&#xD;
      reaction in response to laryngoscopy, intubation and subsequent laparotomy during CD. The&#xD;
      remifentanil administration thus suppress the hypertensive and tachycardiac increase during&#xD;
      the initial period of CD , but without negative influence on newborns postpartum adaptation,&#xD;
      mainly breathing. On the contrary the prevention of uteroplacental blood flow reduction&#xD;
      should improve the postpartum adaptation of the newborn. The project should also give pilot&#xD;
      data, if genetic polymorphisms of target genes, important for remifentanil pharmacokinetic&#xD;
      and pharmacodynamic, influence in Czech population drug efficacy and safety.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As extrapolated result the investigators expect the reduction of complications attributed to&#xD;
      severe BP increase, especially hemorrhagic stroke. The remifentanil administration should not&#xD;
      have any negative influence on newborn, especially on postnatal adaptation and breathing&#xD;
      activity. Prevention of uteroplacental insufficiency in response to hypertension and&#xD;
      tachycardia may even lead to better newborn status.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AIMS&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aims of the project are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To assess newborn postnatal adaptation after cesarean delivery under general anesthesia&#xD;
           with a remifentanil bolus 1 µg/kg prior to the induction of general anesthesia&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To demonstrate a stabilizing influence of remifentanil on circulation and depth of&#xD;
           anesthesia in patients with hypertension/preeclampsia in the time of fetus delivery&#xD;
           during CD&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To assess the influence of individual hereditary variability in MDR1 (multidrug&#xD;
           resistance gene 1) and PXR (pregnane X receptor) on RMF pharmacodynamics.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To assess the influence of individual genetic variability in µ-opioid receptor gene on&#xD;
           drug effects in newborn.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Extrapolated result should be both the reduction of complications in mother associated with&#xD;
      serious increase in systemic blood pressure and improved postpartum newborn adaptation.&#xD;
      Patients with hypertension/preeclampsia are at high risk of insufficient depth of anesthesia&#xD;
      during CD and this may lead to uncontrolled hypertension with the risk of intracranial&#xD;
      bleeding. To avoid this complication represents one of current obstetrician anesthesia&#xD;
      priorities. Optimal introduction to GA in this clinical situation has not been yet&#xD;
      identified.&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODS AND RESEARCH SAMPLE Type of study: prospective, randomized, double-blinded for the&#xD;
      assessment of neonatal adaptation and single-blinded for the evaluation of haemodynamic&#xD;
      changes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient file: 160 pregnant women undergoing CD under GA; 80 patients with&#xD;
      hypertension/preeclampsia - 40 in the REMIFENTANIL group and 40 in the STANDARD (placebo)&#xD;
      group; 80 patients without hypertension/preeclampsia - 40 in the REMIFENTANIL group and 40 in&#xD;
      the STANDARD (placebo) group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization: Will be performed before CD using the envelope method. Randomization and&#xD;
      preparation the appropriate study bolus (remifentanil 1 µg/kg) will be performed by&#xD;
      supervising anesthesiologist. The randomization for the neonatologist will be broken in the&#xD;
      case of medical complication, e.g. when respiratory depression in infant occurs and opioid&#xD;
      antagonist may be administered. Supervising anesthesiologist will not otherwise interfere&#xD;
      with the course of CD or evaluation of the data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Conduct of anesthesia: Thirty seconds prior to GA induction bolus of study drug solution is&#xD;
      given intravenously. Afterwards anesthesia will be conducted in a standard way: induction to&#xD;
      GA with combination of thiopentone 5 mg/kg and suxamethonium 1.25 mg/kg; subsequent&#xD;
      intubation and inhalation of oxygen/nitrous oxide (1:1) and sevoflurane 0.7%. Following the&#xD;
      intubation neuromuscular relaxant Atracurium is administered 0.35 mg/kg. After delivery of&#xD;
      the newborn and umbilical cord clamping opioid analgesia with sufentanil 0.3-0.5 µg/kg and&#xD;
      inhalation of oxygen/nitrous oxide (2:3) + sevoflurane 0.7-1.0% will be administered. If&#xD;
      required, additional bolus of sufentanil 10 µg intravenously will be given.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intraoperative monitoring: All the patients will be monitored according to guidelines with&#xD;
      respect to risk associated with hypertension/preeclampsia and GA for CD - ECG (including V4-5&#xD;
      thoracic lead, ST analysis), SatO2, ETCO2, % of oxygen, % of volatile anesthetics,&#xD;
      ventilation parameters (PIP, MV, TV, F).&#xD;
&#xD;
      For evaluation of anesthesia depth continuous bispectral EEG analysis (BIS) and sympathetic&#xD;
      skin reflex response (SSRR) will be used. BIS is electrophysiological method reflecting the&#xD;
      inability to perceive stimuli from environment using mathematical analysis of EEG curve; SSRR&#xD;
      is unique method measures changes of skin conductivity that with high sensitivity and delay&#xD;
      of only 1-2 sec. reflects immediate changes in sympathetic system to nociceptive stimuli&#xD;
      (Stress Detector; Med-Storm, Norway).&#xD;
&#xD;
      DATA COLLECTION Demographics: age, height, weight, BMI, gestational age, previous pregnancy,&#xD;
      associated medical conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preoperative laboratory values (haematology, liver and kidney function, total protein).&#xD;
      Hemodynamics (BP, MAP, HR, ST analysis), ventilation (MV, SatO2, ETCO2), depth of anaesthesia&#xD;
      (BIS, SSRR). Time course of CD (study drug administration, induction to GA, intubation,&#xD;
      beginning of surgery, hysterotomy, delivery). Measurement of blood loss, complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical examination and assessment of newborn status (Apgar score + acid-base measurement&#xD;
      from umbilical cord, clinical evaluation and scoring).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Biological material sampling To assess genotype of MDR1 gene and PXR (Pregnane X Receptor) 8&#xD;
      ml of umbilical blood and 8 ml of venous blood from mother will be collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pharmacogenomic analysis: Validated methods for PXR and MDR1 polymorphism analysis are&#xD;
      available at our workplace. In both genes five polymorphisms with possible functional impact&#xD;
      will be analyzed in every sample. Method for assessment of opioid receptor polymorphism&#xD;
      (A118G) will be implemented during the first year of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EVALUATION Level of anesthesia depth will be evaluated by BIS and SSRR values and by&#xD;
      hemodynamic response to intubation and incision, especially by changes of BP (systolic,&#xD;
      diastolic, mean) and heart rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evaluation of newborn status will be assessed by Apgar score and acid-basis measurement of&#xD;
      umbilical cord blood and by clinical assessment and scoring performed by experienced&#xD;
      neonatologist.&#xD;
