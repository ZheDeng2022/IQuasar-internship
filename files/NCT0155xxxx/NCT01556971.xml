    <textblock>
      The objective of this proposed study is to obtain data on the efficacy of Botox in reducing&#xD;
      symptoms of MDD in male and female patients between the ages of 18 and 65 years old.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary object is to visually assess each patient's frown before and after the Botox&#xD;
      injection to determine if there is a correlation between changes in the frown and changes in&#xD;
      mood. The patients will be photographed at screening, visit 2 and 3. Their frown lines will&#xD;
      be compared to determine if there is a visible improvement in the frown lines corresponding&#xD;
      to an improvement in the efficacy rating scores.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This will be a double-blind study. To maintain the blinding of the study, none of the&#xD;
      investigators who are assessing depression scores will be aware of the injection status of&#xD;
      the patients. In addition, to maintain patient blinding, the patients will not be educated as&#xD;
      to possible expected outcomes on facial expressions. Unless specifically informed, patients&#xD;
      are generally unaware of the facial movement that is inhibited by Botulinum Toxin A. An&#xD;
      unblinded physician will act as pharmacist for the study preparing the active drug and the&#xD;
      placebo for the injections.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Duration of Treatment: The study will be divided into three phases: screening and enrollment,&#xD;
      treatment and follow-up. Patients who meet all criteria will be randomized at the screening&#xD;
      visit. The treatment phase will last six (6) weeks after the investigational product is&#xD;
      administered during which the patients will return to for a visit at week 3. Subjects will&#xD;
      return to the office for a discontinuation visit at week six.&#xD;
&#xD;
      General Design and Methodology: At screening, patients will sign consent and be diagnosed by&#xD;
      means of the M.I.N.I. They will be assessed by a clinician who will perform the MADRS and&#xD;
      CGI-S which are standardized ratings. They will complete the patient-rated BDI. Subjects will&#xD;
      provide a urine sample for drug screening. WOCBP will be given a pregnancy test. Patients who&#xD;
      meet all criteria will be randomly assigned to receive either the investigational product or&#xD;
      placebo. The study medication or placebo will be injected into the procerus and corrugator&#xD;
      supercilii frown muscles of each patient by a physician or physician's assistant. Each&#xD;
      patient face will be photographed at this an all visits. Three weeks ± 7 days following the&#xD;
      injection, each patient will return to the office where a clinician will administer the MADRS&#xD;
      and the CGI-I. The patient will complete the BDI and adverse events (AEs) and concomitant&#xD;
      medications will be collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Six weeks ± 7 days following the injection, patients will return to the office where the&#xD;
      clinician will administer the MADRS and CGI-I, collect AEs and concomitant medications. The&#xD;
      patients will complete the BDI. All patients, whether on the active drug or the placebo, will&#xD;
      be given a voucher which they may use for a free Botox injection at week 8, if , in the&#xD;
      judgment of the investigator, it will be beneficial to the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Diagnosis and Criteria for Inclusion: Patients will be included in this study if they meet&#xD;
      all of the following criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;

        -  They have been treated with botulinum toxin A in the 12 months prior to screening;&#xD;
&#xD;

           screening;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  They have a history of substance abuse or dependency in the 2 months prior to screening&#xD;
           (recreational use of illicit drugs may be permissible, at the discretion of the&#xD;
           investigator);&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  They test positive for illicit drugs on urine drug screen, and this has not been&#xD;
           adequately explained to the satisfaction of the investigator;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  They endorse MADRS item 10 (suicidal ideas) at a level of 5 or more or have attempted&#xD;
           suicide in the six months prior to screening;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  They are considered to be at a significant risk of committing homicide;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  They have an unstable medical condition;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Women of childbearing potential (WOCBP) who are pregnant or are considering becoming&#xD;
           pregnant during the length of the study;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  They are regarded, for any reason by the principal investigator as being an unsuitable&#xD;
           candidate for the protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  There has been a change in their medication or psychotherapy treatment regimen in the&#xD;
           month preceding screening;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  They have proved to be refractory to three or more adequate antidepressant treatments&#xD;
           with methods that have different mechanisms of action.&#xD;
