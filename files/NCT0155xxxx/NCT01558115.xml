  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT), a disease characterized by excess parathyroid hormone&#xD;
      (PTH) and high blood calcium, is one of the most common endocrine disorders. PHPT is seen&#xD;
      most often in postmenopausal women. Many patients with PHPT have low bone mineral density&#xD;
      (BMD) when bone mass is measured by dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA), primarily at the&#xD;
      forearm. There is currently no effective medical therapy which increases bone density at the&#xD;
      forearm in patients with PHPT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PTH both builds and breaks down bone, and the pathways by which PTH mediates these actions&#xD;
      are beginning to be identified. Prior research suggests that RANKL, a molecule important in&#xD;
      bone metabolism, responds to PTH, and that if the RANKL is inactivated, PTH is shifted&#xD;
      towards building bone. The investigators will study the effect of Denosumab, a therapeutic&#xD;
      agent that binds to and inactivates RANKL, in 28 postmenopausal women with PHPT. Our&#xD;
      hypothesis is that Denosumab will increase bone mineral density in primary&#xD;
      hyperparathyroidism.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will last two years, and subjects will be randomly assigned to receive either&#xD;
      placebo or Denosumab for the first year of the study. In the second year, all subjects will&#xD;
      receive Denosumab. Denosumab (60 mg) or placebo will be given every 6 months by an injection&#xD;
      just under the skin. Study procedures performed will include bone mineral density tests by&#xD;
      DXA, high-resolution peripheral quantitative computed tomography (HR-pQCT) scans, and&#xD;
      assessments of biochemical markers of calcium metabolism and bone turnover using both blood&#xD;
      and urine samples of subjects with PHPT.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      PTH has both catabolic and anabolic properties, and under normal circumstances, PTH in PHPT&#xD;
      is catabolic for bone at the cortical skeleton. Recently, evidence for a direct role of PTH&#xD;
      on RANKL expression and osteoclastogenesis in vivo was obtained using mice lacking a distant&#xD;
      transcriptional enhancer of the RANKL gene that confers responsiveness to PTH. These&#xD;
      observations, supported by additional cross-sectional studies in human subjects make a&#xD;
      compelling argument that the catabolic actions of PTH are mediated by RANKL-mediated bone&#xD;
      resorption.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators now propose a proof of concept study to test the hypothesis that in PHPT,&#xD;
      inhibition of the RANK-L pathway will unmask the anabolic potential of PTH. A therapeutic&#xD;
      agent that redirects the actions of PTH in PHPT from one that is primarily catabolic to an&#xD;
      anabolic one would fulfill this proof of concept. The investigators hypothesize that&#xD;
      Denosumab, a human IgG antibody that binds to and inactivates RANKL, will convert skeletal&#xD;
      actions of PTH from catabolic to anabolic in primary hyperparathyroidism.&#xD;
