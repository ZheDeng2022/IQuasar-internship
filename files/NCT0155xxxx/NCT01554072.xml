    <textblock>
      Pulmonary rehabilitation consists of a multidisciplinary program of care for patients with&#xD;
      chronic respiratory disease, which currently encompasses numerous features and physical&#xD;
      training methods aimed at maintaining stability clinic for people with Chronic Obstructive&#xD;
      Pulmonary Disease (COPD), especially in patients who, even with optimized clinical treatment,&#xD;
      continue their decline and symptomatic physical functions and 8 so that these social. goals&#xD;
      are achieved the patient with COPD should integrate into a program of RP assiduous and with&#xD;
      accompanying several times per week, for several months, which for a number of factors is not&#xD;
      always possible. For this reason, it is the research of methodology of RP that hold their&#xD;
      effectiveness, but with greater flexibility and viability to people with COPD. On this basis,&#xD;
      this study aims to investigate the effectiveness of a program of RP semi-domiciliar in which&#xD;
      the patient suffering from COPD can receive guidance and training in person, to develop it&#xD;
      partially in own domicile.&#xD;

      The protocol of the experimental procedure will begin with the explanation of the purpose,&#xD;
      risks and benefits of the study volunteers to patients with COPD. Subsequently, based on an&#xD;
      evaluation form, will collect data on the past history and current disease and performed a&#xD;
      general physical examination. Then the patients will respond to two questionnaires. The first&#xD;
      will research the Medical Council (MRC) 13, which is a dyspnea scale to categorize in terms&#xD;
      of disability, patients with COPD. The second questionnaire will be the Airway Questionnaire&#xD;
      20 (AQ20) 14 specific for obstructive pulmonary disease, which is validated for the local&#xD;
      language and highly reliable for the evaluation of patients with COPD, containing 20&#xD;
      questions related to respiratory health to evaluate the quality of life. Subsequently, the&#xD;
      same day, the patients carry out the following tests: spirometry, respiratory muscle&#xD;
      strength, respiratory muscle endurance, assessment of training load of the upper and shuttle&#xD;
      test and bioimpedance&#xD;

For each day of the year ended data should be recorded in a daily monitoring. At the end of two months of the PR program semi-home patients will be subject to review so that all tests should be applied again.</description>
