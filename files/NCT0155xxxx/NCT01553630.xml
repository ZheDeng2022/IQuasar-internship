  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Comminuted metaphyseal fractures (OTA classification A2/3 and C2/3) of the distal femur and&#xD;
      distal tibia are difficult to treat and typically have more complications than other&#xD;
      metaphyseal fractures. Delayed union, nonunion and need for secondary bone graft procedures&#xD;
      are frequent outcomes. These A2/3 and C2/3 fractures of the distal femur and distal tibia&#xD;
      treated with locked plates often have a critical sized fracture gap (poorly organized&#xD;
      cortical pieces many of which are stripped of soft tissue). Optimal management strategies&#xD;
      that minimize both fracture healing time and complication rates remain controversial. Primary&#xD;
      bone grafts or early secondary bone grafts have been recommended for these comminuted open&#xD;
      fractures, but have not been studied as the primary end point in a randomized trial. There is&#xD;
      a need to study primary bone grafting during open reduction and internal fixation (plating)&#xD;
      of these difficult fractures, to determine if shorter healing time, and thus less need for&#xD;
      reoperation, can be achieved.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis Acute autogenous bone grafting at the time of fixation will hasten clinical and&#xD;
      radiographic union with a lower need for secondary procedures&#xD;

      Study procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible fractures will be identified, consented and randomized to RIA augmentation or non&#xD;
      graft treatment. Bone graft will be harvested through the fracture at the time of the&#xD;
      definitive fixation procedure. No additional graft can be utilized acutely (No iliac crest&#xD;
      bone graft, or INFUSE, OP-1, Callos, etc).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization Procedures: We will be using Research Randomizer to calculate a random&#xD;
      assignment design for Group A and Group B, which will be kept by the Research Coordinator.&#xD;
      Once a patient agrees to participate in the study and signs an Informed Consent Form, the&#xD;
      treating surgeon will request the treatment assignment from the Research Coordinator prior to&#xD;
      the surgery. Group A will receive RIA augmentation. Group B will receive non-graft treatment.&#xD;
      Patient outcomes will be analyzed using intention to treat principles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Surgical Procedures: Locked lateral plating of comminuted supracondylar femur and distal&#xD;
      tibia fractures is an accepted standard of care. In severely comminuted fracture patterns,&#xD;
      restoration of length and alignment often leaves substantial fracture gap increasing the risk&#xD;
      of fracture nonunion. Historically, this has been accepted with the plan to return to the&#xD;
      patient to surgery for bone grafting at a later date if the nonunion is developing.&#xD;
      Intra-focal reaming with irrigation &amp; aspiration (RIA) at time of initial surgery allows for&#xD;
      acute autogenous bone grafting with no increased morbidity to the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Surgery for Group A receiving bone graft follows the same course as without acute grafting&#xD;
      (same incision, dissection etc.) with the exception that after initial exposure, a guide wire&#xD;
      is placed into the proximal femoral canal (retrograde) through the fracture, and graft is&#xD;
      harvested using the RIA system. The RIA system has a reservoir to collect the reamings as&#xD;
      they are aspirated from the fracture site. Reduction and fixation with locked plates then&#xD;
      proceed as usual and the harvested graft is then placed into the residual gap with the&#xD;
      expectation that nonunion rates may be decreased. A theoretical advantage is the renewed&#xD;
      fracture hematoma that will collect at the fracture site secondary to reaming the canal which&#xD;
      may also increase union rates and time to union. No increased morbidity is incurred and the&#xD;
      increased surgical time is under 10 minutes.&#xD;
