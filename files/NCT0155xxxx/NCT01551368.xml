  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Nimodipine (Nimotop® Bayer Pharmaceuticals Corporation), unlike other calcium channel&#xD;
      blockers is fat soluble and therefore is able to cross the blood-brain barrier1. Gonadotropin&#xD;
      releasing hormone (GnRH) neurons are clustered in the hypothalamus and are dependent on&#xD;
      calcium flux to release GnRH responsible for the release of follicle-stimulating hormone&#xD;
      (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH) from the anterior pituitary. In a natural menstrual cycle&#xD;
      a spontaneous LH surge occurs mid-cycle which triggers ovulation. The investigators&#xD;
      hypothesized that nimodipine, by blocking calcium channels, may effectively suppress the&#xD;
      release of GnRH and consequently the natural LH surge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this prospective double-blinded randomized study the investigators will evaluate the&#xD;
      efficacy of nimodipine to inhibit the natural LH surge in women undergoing controlled ovarian&#xD;
      stimulation (COS) and intrauterine insemination (IUI). Nimodipine, if successful, may&#xD;
      represent an inexpensive oral medication as an alternative to the currently used GnRH&#xD;
      agonists or GnRH antagonists in assisted reproductive technologies like IVF.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In reproductive aged women regular ovulatory cycles generate 1-2 mature ovarian follicles&#xD;
      every month. Approximately mid-cycle a natural LH surge is observed and predictably induces&#xD;
      ovulation within 24-36 hours. LH is a hormone produced by the anterior pituitary gland and is&#xD;
      released in response to GnRH. Concurrently GnRH is synthesized and released in a pulsatile&#xD;
      manner from GnRH neurons within the hypothalamus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One of the essential steps of successful IVF is to ensure the properly timed aspiration of&#xD;
      mature follicles from the ovaries prior to ovulation. If ovulation were to precede aspiration&#xD;
      then the oocytes would have already been released and become unobtainable. Therefore&#xD;
      inhibiting spontaneous ovulation is a crucial component of successful oocyte retrieval. In&#xD;
      the clinical setting of IUI no oocyte retrieval is required, but appropriate timing of&#xD;
      insemination with respect to ovulation is critical.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A premature LH surge and subsequent premature luteinization may occur in up to a third of&#xD;
      ovarian stimulation cycles using gonadotropins (applicable to both IUI and IVF cycles),&#xD;
      making it a major cause of treatment cancellation and having a negative impact on pregnancy&#xD;
      outcomes 2-5. The most commonly used medications to prevent a premature LH surge are GnRH&#xD;
      agonists and more recently GnRH antagonists. They are both commonly administered&#xD;
      subcutaneously on a daily basis and act on the anterior pituitary gland (through different&#xD;
      mechanisms) to inhibit the release of LH. Besides the additional patient cost and burden,&#xD;
      these medications are associated with prolonged treatment protocols and decreased ovarian&#xD;
      response to stimulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nimodipine is a unique calcium channel blocker with lipophilic properties and a greater&#xD;
      affinity for cerebral vasculature, and therefore has the ability to cross the blood-brain&#xD;
      barrier. In a study on mice with induced intracerebral hemorrhage, nimodipine treatment&#xD;
      improved cerebral bloodflow and displayed anti-ischemic effects. Nimodipine has obtained FDA&#xD;
      approval to reduce the severity of neurological deficits in patients who have had a recent&#xD;
      subarachnoid hemorrhage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On a cellular level nimodipine has been shown to inhibit the pulsatile activity of GnRH gene&#xD;
      expression, an intrinsic property of GnRH neurons that is necessary for proper initiation of&#xD;
      the LH surge. Specifically, nimodipine blocks L-type voltage gated calcium channels which&#xD;
      prevent the influx of extracellular calcium and subsequently the stimulation of GnRH release.&#xD;
      The intrinsic pulsatile secretion of GnRH has been directly associated with the rhythmic&#xD;
      changes in intracellular calcium concentration in GnRH neurons.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Objectives and Endpoints&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objective&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To determine if nimodipine can effectively inhibit the natural LH surge in women&#xD;
           undergoing controlled ovarian stimulation and intrauterine insemination.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Secondary Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To determine the medication side effect profile of nimodipine, specifically symptoms of&#xD;
           hypotension, tachycardia, nausea or headache.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To determine the treatment compliance rate (nimodipine or placebo).&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To determine the clinical pregnancy rate for each intervention arm (nimodipine or&#xD;
           placebo) during the COS and IUI treatment cycle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Endpoint&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The presence or absence of an LH surge on intervention Day 1 and Day 2. LH surge will be&#xD;
           determined by serum LH levels at least two times the baseline serum LH.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Baseline serum LH = (Cycle Day 3 serum [LH] + Cycle Day 7 serum [LH]) /2.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Secondary Endpoint&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Medication side effect profile:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Symptomatic hypotension [Note: vital signs will not be routinely recorded]&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Symptomatic tachycardia [Note: vital signs will not be routinely recorded]&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Headache&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Nausea (self-reporting; constructed questionnaire)&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Patient treatment compliance (self-reporting; constructed questionnaire)&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Clinical Pregnancy (positive BHCG and ultrasound evidence of fetal heart rate)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment / Baseline Assessment The study population will be derived from a pool of&#xD;
      patients referred to TCART (Toronto Centre for Assisted Reproductive Technology; Toronto,&#xD;
      Canada). Patients that have been comprehensively evaluated for infertility and subsequently&#xD;
      recommended to undergo controlled ovarian stimulation and intra-uterine insemination will be&#xD;
      approached and recruited to participate in the study. Patients will be screened and evaluated&#xD;
      for eligibility (based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria) by direct contact from one of&#xD;
      the dedicated study investigators or dedicated research staff.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization Randomization will be computer generated in a block design of 6 patients. Six&#xD;
      corresponding opaque envelopes that enclose the blinded medication will be administered&#xD;
      sequentially to consenting patients. Randomization will be performed at the start of the COH&#xD;
      cycle and consequently the data will be analyzed as an intention-to-treat analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blinding Procedures Both patients and medical staff will be blinded to the treatment arms.&#xD;
      Both the nimodipine (30 mg po qid) and placebo groups (placebo po qid) will receive 8&#xD;
      identical tablets with the same instructions for self-administration. The capsules will be&#xD;
      only be identified by a unique study number to allow accurate analysis at the end of the&#xD;
      study. A single pharmacy will be responsible for blinding, labeling and packaging the&#xD;
      medication. Only the study coordinator (DN), who will not be involved clinically with study&#xD;
      participants, will remain unblinded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interventions&#xD;
&#xD;
      Drug Formulation Nimotop® (Nimodipine) Bayer Pharmaceuticals Corporation. Calcium channel&#xD;
      blocker. 30mg oral soft gelatin capsules.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dosage Regimen Nimodipine is rapidly absorbed after oral administration reaching a peak&#xD;
      concentration within one hour. It has a half-life of approximately 1-2 hours and a terminal&#xD;
      clearance half-life of 8 hours, and thus requires relatively frequent administration. It is&#xD;
      currently approved for the acute treatment of subarachnoid hemorrhage, with a dosing regimen&#xD;
      of 60mg po q4h for 21 consecutive days. Several pharmacokinetic studies have focused on 30mg&#xD;
      doses three times daily with no evidence of accumulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In our study intervention will be initiated once ovarian follicle maturation has been&#xD;
      documented (≥1 ovarian follicle size of ≥ 17mm) and the absence of a premature LH surge has&#xD;
      been confirmed - this will be classified as intervention day 0. Patients will receive oral&#xD;
      nimodipine 30mg four times daily over a two day period with the following dosing schedule:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Intervention Day 0 - noon / afternoon / bedtime (3 doses)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Intervention Day 1 - morning / noon / afternoon / bedtime (4 doses)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Intervention Day 2 - morning (1 dose)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Washout Period Nimodipine is eliminated almost exclusively in the form of metabolites. Less&#xD;
      than 1% is recovered in the urine as unchanged drug. Over 95% of the medication is bound to&#xD;
      plasma proteins. Nimodipine has a half life of 1-2 hours, with terminal elimination half life&#xD;
      of approximately 8 hours. It should be completely eliminated from the body in about 40 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Contraindications to Nimodipine use&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients of Nimodipine.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The use of Nimodipine in combination with Rifampicin&#xD;
&#xD;
      Precautions to Nimodipine use&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Caution is required in patients with hypotension&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Nimodipine is metabolized by the cytochrome P450 3A4 system, therefore drugs (or&#xD;
           grapefruit juice) that are known to either inhibit or to induce this enzyme should be&#xD;
           taken into account, including:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Rifampicin&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Quinupristin / Dalfopristin&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Valproic Acid&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Nortryptyline&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Outcome variables:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Side effects - Nausea, headache, lightheadedness, dizziness, diaphoresis, presyncopal or&#xD;
           palpitations/tachycardia.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Treatment compliance - Number of tablets taken (out of the prescribed 8 tablets),&#xD;
           appropriate timing of medication (as instructed)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Clinical pregnancy → positive bHCG serum test 2 weeks post IUI and ultrasound&#xD;
           documentation of a fetal heart rate&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study - Delayed Ovulation Induction and Monitoring:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Deviating from routine practice, our study protocol will call for a two-day delay in the&#xD;
           hCG injection after the ultrasound detection of a mature ovarian follicle (intervention&#xD;
           day 0). At this time point patients will have already been randomized and blinded to&#xD;
           receive nimodipine 30 mg po qid, or placebo po qid for two days to ideally prevent the&#xD;
           natural LH surge for a further 48 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  During the two day period all study patients (nimodipine or placebo) will continue to be&#xD;
           monitored daily at the clinic (mornings of day 1 and day 2) which will include&#xD;
           transvaginal ultrasound and serum measurements of estradiol, LH and progesterone.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If during the two day period an LH surge is detected during daily morning monitoring&#xD;
           (eg. on day 1 or on day 2), the standard protocol of ovulation induction and IUI will be&#xD;
           initiated - injection of hCG 250 mcg that same afternoon and two IUIs performed 16 hours&#xD;
           and 40 hours after hCG injection. Participant will discontinue taking their assigned&#xD;
           medication after an LH surge has been detected.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If an LH surge is not detected during daily monitoring on day 1, the patient will&#xD;
           continue taking their assigned medication and with daily monitoring.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If an LH surge is not detected during daily monitoring by day 2, ovulation will be&#xD;
           induced that same afternoon (~5 pm) by the injection of hCG 250 mcg followed by a single&#xD;
           IUI 40 hours later.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety and Adverse Events Patients undergoing COS and IUI are regularly monitored for optimal&#xD;
      treatment response and timing of IUI. Therefore investigators in this study will also have&#xD;
      the opportunity to closely observe any safety or adverse events associated with the two-day&#xD;
      duration of active intervention (nimodipine 30mg po qid x 48 hours). Specifically all&#xD;
      patients will be asked about medication (nimodipine and placebo) compliance and side effects&#xD;
      experienced during the morning cycle monitoring (day 1 and day 2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nimodipine has traditionally been investigated at higher does, frequencies and longer&#xD;
      duration. According to the product monograph1, a dosing regimen of nimodipine 60mg po q4h&#xD;
      resulted in the following side effects: hypotension (3.8%), nausea (1.2%), headache (1.2%)&#xD;
      and bradycardia (1%). Conservative management consisted of discontinuing nimodipine and&#xD;
      generally was effective in reversing the symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Analysis Plan / Statistical Plan Data will be expressed as mean +/- SD or percentage&#xD;
      where applicable. Independent samples will be compared using the Student t test. The&#xD;
      chi-squared test and Fisher exact test will be used for categorical data. A P value of &lt;0.05&#xD;
      will be considered to indicate statistical significance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample Size and Power Sample size calculations were performed using the computer program PS:&#xD;
      Power and sample size calculation by William Dupont. We are planning a study of independent&#xD;
      samples of treatments and controls with a 1:1 randomization. Expert opinion / prior data&#xD;
      suggest that approximately 50% of patients in the placebo arm will have a natural LH surge&#xD;
      detected on day 2 post intervention after a follicular maturation has been reached15. If 20%&#xD;
      of patients in the nimodipine arm have a natural LH surge detected on day 2 post&#xD;
      intervention, then we will need 38 subjects in each of the study arms to reject the null&#xD;
      hypothesis (both groups have equal incidence of natural LH surge on day 2 post intervention)&#xD;
      with a power of 0.8 and a type I error probability of 0.05. We anticipate approximately a 15%&#xD;
      dropout rate leading to a total recruitment of 90 patients (45 per study arm).&#xD;
