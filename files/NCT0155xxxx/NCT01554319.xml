  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Asthma is a chronic inflammatory bronchial disorder with three distinct components: airway&#xD;
      hyper-responsiveness (respiratory hypersensitivity), airway inflammation, and intermittent&#xD;
      airway obstruction. One of the characteristics of the disease is an inflammatory reaction of&#xD;
      the immune system caused by cytokine production. A substantial number of asthma patients do&#xD;
      not satisfactorily respond to steroid therapy and consequently have an unmet medical need for&#xD;
      novel targeted therapies with improved specificity, tolerability, and compliance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Novel therapeutic strategies for the treatment of chronic inflammatory diseases by targeting&#xD;
      early disease-causing mechanisms are a promising approach for the treatment of asthma. The&#xD;
      transcription factor GATA-3 plays a key role in mediating the asthmatic immune response and&#xD;
      has been shown to be necessary and sufficient for the production of cytokines interleukin&#xD;
      (IL)-4, IL-5, and IL-13. The active principle hgd40 of the investigational medicinal product&#xD;
      SB010 belongs to a new class of antisense oligonucleotide therapeutics, the 10-23 DNA&#xD;
      (deoxyribonucleic acid)zymes (antisense oligonucleotide). DNAzymes are catalytically active&#xD;
      nucleic acids that cleave complementary RNA (ribonucleic acid) molecules. By cleaving GATA-3&#xD;
      mRNA, hgd40 reduces specific cytokine production and thereby reduces key features of allergic&#xD;
      airway inflammation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DNAzymes are generated completely by chemical synthesis and can be produced under Good&#xD;
      Manufacturing Practice (GMP) controlled conditions. The DNAzymes are not biological drugs,&#xD;
      i.e. they are not generated by use of any living organism including cell culture or bacteria.&#xD;
      The molecules are highly water-soluble and will be applied as solution directly in their&#xD;
      synthesized form.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The current study will evaluate the safety and tolerability of increasing multiple doses of&#xD;
      inhaled SB010 in healthy male subjects.&#xD;

    <description>The following pharmacokinetic parameters will be determined over 15 days using plasma samples, after a single dose on Day 1 and after repeated dosing at steady state on Day 12:&#xD;
Area under the plasma concentration-time curve: from 0 to 12h, over 12h (dosing interval) after the last administration in steady state, and extrapolated to infinity.&#xD;

    <description>Dose proportionality# after a single dose on Day 1 and after repeated dosing at steady state on Day 12 will be assessed across doses using the power model.&#xD;
#Dose proportionality implies linear pharmacokinetics. The rates of absorption, distribution, metabolism, and elimination remain constant over the dose range. Thus, plasma concentration, area under the plasma concentration-time curve, maximum plasma concentration, and urinary recovery should increase in direct proportion to the dose.</description>
