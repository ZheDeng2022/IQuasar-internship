    <textblock>
      Kedrion Human Plasminogen, a sterile human plasma-derived plasminogen preparation for topical&#xD;
      ocular use will be evaluated for the indication of treatment of ligneous conjunctivitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      KB046 will be an open-label, historically controlled clinical trial. At least 10 subjects&#xD;
      with ligneous conjunctivitis, for approximately 20 eyes, will be treated and assessed. All&#xD;
      subjects will receive the investigational medicinal product (IMP) for 12 to 48 weeks, with a&#xD;
      possibility for extended treatment (Continuation segment)&#xD;

      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects should be diagnosed with ligneous conjunctivitis associated with Type I&#xD;
             plasminogen deficiency, confirmed by the central laboratory and documented at&#xD;
             pre-enrollment screening. The concomitant presence of other ligneous pseudomembranes&#xD;
             at different sites will not constitute an exclusion criterion.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects should have documented historical records of disease course available for a&#xD;
             period of at least 6 months surrounding an episode of LC, even if asymptomatic in the&#xD;
             past for a newly diagnosed subject , including but not limited to age of LC onset,&#xD;
             diagnosis of Plasminogen 1 deficiency, history of pseudomembrane lesions, disease&#xD;
             duration, past treatment for LC, response to treatment and/or surgery (including&#xD;
             regression and recurrence), before study entrance. If more history than 6 months&#xD;
             surrounding an LC episode is available it will be included.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects, or their legally authorized representative, in the case of study&#xD;
             participants &lt; 18 years of age, should have been informed of the nature of the study,&#xD;
             agreed to its provision, signed and dated the informed consent approved by the&#xD;
             investigational review board (IRB) or ethics committee (EC).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects available for the duration of the study will be included. The Investigator&#xD;
             will make sure that there is no plan for the subject to leave the area of the study&#xD;
             site before the end of the study period. If they come from another center, they must&#xD;
             agree to be compliant with the protocol mandated study visits and return for&#xD;
             follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects presenting ligneous conjunctivitis not associated with Type 1 plasminogen&#xD;
             deficiency.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects with no history of LC lesions for Group 2, for Group 1 the entry lesions&#xD;
             could be the first and included as history.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject presenting antibodies against plasminogen at screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects with any condition which, in the opinion of the Investigator, might interfere&#xD;
             with the evaluation of the study objectives, or participation in this trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects unwilling to give written informed consent or assent to participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects who have participated in another clinical trial within 1 month before study&#xD;
             initiation, i.e. they have received any test drug within 30 days prior the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Females of childbearing potential who are either pregnant or not using an adequate&#xD;
             method of birth control&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Females who are breastfeeding.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects being treated with FFP or Laboratory Grade Plasminogen will undergo a washout&#xD;
             period of at least 15 days before being considered for this study. This information&#xD;
             will be disseminated to subjects ahead of their Screening Visit and will only occur&#xD;
             following signing of the Informed Consent&#xD;
