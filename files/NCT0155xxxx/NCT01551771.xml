    <textblock>
      This study is the first administration of GW824575 in humans. This will be a single centre,&#xD;
      masked, placebo-controlled study, to investigate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics&#xD;
      (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD) of GW824575, given as single and repeated oral doses to&#xD;
      healthy male subjects. The study will be comprised of 4 parts and enroll approximately 40&#xD;
      subjects: Part A will consist of two cohorts of 8 healthy male subjects to assess the safety,&#xD;
      tolerability, PK, and PD of ascending single oral doses of GW824575. All available safety,&#xD;
      tolerability, and PK data will be monitored prior to each dose escalation. In order to&#xD;
      support the possible indication for age-related macular degeneration (AMD), Part B will be&#xD;
      one cohort of 12 subjects to examine the safety, tolerability, PK, and PD of a repeated dose&#xD;
      of GW824575 over 21 days in healthy male subjects who are greater than or equal to 50 years&#xD;
      of age. The total daily dose in this cohort will not exceed the maximum tolerated dose (MTD)&#xD;
      from Parts A and D. Subjects in this cohort will undergo ophthalmology assessments before&#xD;
      receiving investigational product and after Day 7 of the 21-day in-patient treatment, after&#xD;
      steady state has been reached. As part of protocol amendment 2, Part C (Cohort 4) is removed&#xD;
      from the protocol. Part D, added under protocol amendment 2, will consist of one cohort of 12&#xD;
      healthy male subjects to assess safety, tolerability, PK, and PD of ascending single doses of&#xD;
      GW824575 as well as the effect of food on the PK of GW824575.&#xD;

      Part A will consist of two cohorts of healthy male subjects to assess the safety,&#xD;
      tolerability, and PK of ascending single oral doses of GW824575. The sponsor will review&#xD;
      available safety, tolerability, and PK data and, where available, PD receptor occupancy (from&#xD;
      the eosinophil shape change data) data before each dose escalation. Outcome measures in Part&#xD;
      A will be assessed and presented through 48 hours post-dose for each of up to 4 single dose&#xD;
      escalations per cohort. Part B will be one cohort to examine the safety, tolerability and PK&#xD;
      of a repeated dose of GW824575 over 21 days in healthy male subjects who are greater than or&#xD;
      equal to 50 years of age. Subjects in this cohort will undergo ophthalmic assessments before&#xD;
      receiving investigational product and after Day 7 of the 21-day in-patient treatment, after&#xD;
      steady state has been reached. The PD endpoints such as receptor occupancy will be assessed.&#xD;
      The dosing regimen (once or twice daily) will be determined by PK data from Part A; however,&#xD;
      regardless of dosing regimen, subjects will only receive a single dose in the morning on Days&#xD;
      1 and 21 of the treatment period. Outcome measures in Part B (Cohort 3) will be assessed and&#xD;
      presented through 21 days repeat dosing until 48 hours post-dose last dose (i.e., on Day 23).&#xD;
      If a safety signal is noted during, or after, the conduct of Cohort 3 of the study; the&#xD;
      cohort may be halted or dose down-titrated, and an additional cohort, at a lower dose, may be&#xD;
      instituted in Part B as Cohort 5. Dose selection for the additional cohort (Cohort 5) will be&#xD;
      informed by the aggregate safety, PK, and PD data available at that time. Part D will consist&#xD;
      of one cohort of healthy male subjects. The cohort will 1) explore the effect of a high fat&#xD;
      meal on the PK of GW824575 during two treatment periods with approximately 48 hour washout&#xD;
      between periods and 2) assess the safety, tolerability, and PK of ascending single oral doses&#xD;
      of GW824575 administered in the fasting state or with a standard meal in up to 3 additional&#xD;
      treatment periods with at least 6-day washout between periods. The sponsor will review&#xD;
      available safety, tolerability, and PK data and, where available, PD RO (from the eosinophil&#xD;
      shape change data) data before each dose escalation.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Within 6 months prior to the Screening Visit, use of medications known to be toxic to&#xD;
