    <textblock>
      Double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled Phase I Trial to determine the safety and&#xD;
      pharmokinetics of a single dose of CRS3123 in healthy adult volunteers. Forty healthy male&#xD;
      and female subjects 18 to 45 years will be admitted in 5 dosing Cohorts, 8 subjects per&#xD;
      Cohort. Up to two alternates may be used per dosing Cohorts for study subjects that drop out.&#xD;
      The primary objective of the study is to determine the safety and tolerability of escalating&#xD;
      doses of CRS3123 following oral administration to healthy subjects.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase I, multi-center, placebo-controlled, double-blind, dose-escalation study to&#xD;
      evaluate the safety and tolerability of CRS3123, a methionyl-tRNA synthetase inhibitor. Since&#xD;
      this is a FIH study of a new class of drugs, the maximum safe starting dose was estimated&#xD;
      from the NOAEL from preclinical studies in accordance with FDA guidance documents (FDA&#xD;
      Guidance for Industry, July 2005). A very low starting dose has been chosen. In the initial&#xD;
      Cohorts, doses of 100, 200 and 400 will be given; all are below the estimated human starting&#xD;
      dose. If any significant safety signals are encountered, the investigators will notify the&#xD;
      SMC and call for a review. Dose escalation to Cohorts D and E will require a full SMC review&#xD;
      of all safety data obtained through Day 7 for the preceding Cohorts. Forty healthy male and&#xD;
      female subjects 18 to 45 years, inclusive, will be admitted for an inpatient study. Each&#xD;
      subject will receive a single oral dose of CRS3123 or placebo. There will be 8 patients for&#xD;
      each cohort (6 active, 2 placebo). The ascending doses are 100, 200, 400, 800 and 1200 mg&#xD;
      respectively for cohorts A through E. The primary objective is the safety and tolerability of&#xD;
      escalating doses of CRS3123 following oral administration to healthy subjects. The secondary&#xD;
      objective is to assess whether there is measurable systemic exposure and if so, to determine&#xD;
      the plasma pharmacokinetic characteristics of CRS3123 after a single oral dose.&#xD;
