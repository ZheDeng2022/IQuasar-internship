      Testing and Linkage to Care for Injecting Drug Users in Kenya:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interventions for people who inject drugs (PWID) in sub-Saharan African have been almost&#xD;
      entirely absent, despite the fact that in countries like Kenya they contribute a growing&#xD;
      proportion of incident HIV infections. This study will leverage a historic decision in Kenya&#xD;
      to launch needle exchange program (NSP) and related services for this most-at-risk population&#xD;
      (MARP). The investigators will use this NSP/MARP platform to seek out PWID, deliver rapid HIV&#xD;
      testing, point of care CD4 count and link to ART using peer case managers, and evaluate&#xD;
      community viral load impact using a stepped wedge cluster-randomized design. Lessons learned&#xD;
      will have important applicability throughout sub-Saharan African.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HCV Among PWID in Kenya: A Supplement to the TLC-IDU study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The prevalence of HCV in Kenya, where an increasing number of people who inject drugs (PWID)&#xD;
      live and are becoming HIV- as well as HCV-infected, has not been defined. We will establish&#xD;
      HCV prevalence among PWID in Nairobi, Western, and Coastal region by adding HCV rapid and&#xD;
      confirmatory tests in our parent PWID study (TLC-IDU Kenya); deliver appropriate counseling&#xD;
      and treatment options to those eligible; collect HCV treatment adherence data; and&#xD;
      disseminate study findings. These data will provide novel and relevant information about HCV&#xD;
      and HIV co-infection in Kenya among PWID that will be immediately applicable in terms of&#xD;
      public health impact to national and regional HCV testing, counseling, and clinical&#xD;
      management policy.&#xD;

      Testing and Linkage to Care for Injecting Drug Users in Kenya&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of the study will be to leverage the GoK's first-ever needle and syringe program,&#xD;
      to implement the HIV seek, test, treat, and retain paradigm among PWID, whose parenteral and&#xD;
      sexual transmission networks amplify HIV epidemics. Study innovations include: (1) use of a&#xD;
      stepped wedge trial design; (2) intent to track community viral load in a low-income country&#xD;
      setting; (3) use of rapid CD4 assays to reduce time from HIV diagnosis to ART initiation; and&#xD;
      (4) use of conditional cash transfers to support peer case management of participant HIV&#xD;
      treatment retention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1: Evaluate seek test treat retain using a stepped wedge cluster-randomized design.&#xD;
      Clusters will be the planned NSP service sites. The investigators will initiate&#xD;
      respondent-driven sampling (RDS) to reach PWID in Nairobi, Western region and coastal Mombasa&#xD;
      (including Malindi) for baseline HIV-1 prevalence determination, then collect waves of study&#xD;
      data as service sites roll out, including behavioral data. Teams will do rapid HIV and HCV&#xD;
      testing and refer for addiction/mental health and other services (e.g., OST). HIV-positives&#xD;
      will receive prevention with positives (PwP) counseling and point of care CD4 counts. Those&#xD;
      with CD4 &lt;500/Î¼L will be assigned a peer case manager to link the person to ART at&#xD;
      study-participating HIV clinics, support ART and PwP adherence and care retention. Both peer&#xD;
      case managers and subjects will receive small conditional cash transfers for subject's&#xD;
      adherence to HIV care visits. Primary study outcomes will include time to successful linkage&#xD;
      to care, time to ART, and community viral load before and after TLC-IDU initiation.&#xD;
      'Community viral load' will be ascertained by collecting specimens from randomly-selected&#xD;
      HIV-positives at each of the NASCOP NSP-IDU service sites. This sampling will be done in&#xD;
      waves over time, to document changes in infectivity (median viral load). With individual&#xD;
      viral loads collected per site per time step (for a n= of at least 1800 viral loads in total&#xD;
      across all sites and timewaves) the investigators will have good power to detect log10 viral&#xD;
      load changes of 0.23 and hazard ratios of ~1.5 when comparing pre- and post-intervention&#xD;
      period using linear mixed effects analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1: Research hypothesis: Staggered rollout of a planned NSP/MARP program can be utilized&#xD;
      to collect pre- and post intervention data that will allow assessment of impact on community&#xD;
      viral load. Linkage to care will be higher, time to ART initiation will be reduced, and&#xD;
      retention in care will be higher during time periods with the TLC-IDU services as compared to&#xD;
      time periods with standard of care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2: Conduct mathematical modeling to estimate community viral load in PWID injecting and&#xD;
      sexual networks, and to assess potential population-level impact of the TLC-IDU intervention&#xD;
      on Ro, numbers of infections averted, and quality-adjusted life expectancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2: Research hypothesis: HIV transmission dynamics models can use parameters from Aim 1&#xD;
      data waves, with sensitivity analyses identifying those parameters with largest impact on&#xD;
      effect estimation and stability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 3: Assess the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of the TLC-IDU model, using a national&#xD;
      payer perspective. This study will provide among the world's first data regarding&#xD;
      implementation of the seek, test, treat and retain paradigm with IDUs in sub-Saharan Africa.&#xD;
      It will demonstrate the degree to which a combination of structural, biomedical and&#xD;
      behavioral interventions can reduce infectivity. Partnership with Kenya's national HIV&#xD;
      program will allow lessons learned from this study to inform other countries considering how&#xD;
      best to address the growing PWID contribution to the HIV epidemic in this high-HIV-burden&#xD;
      region.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 3: Research hypothesis: Utilizing MARP/NSP services will result in a reduction in median&#xD;
      community viral load and in forward HIV transmission. Cost per quality adjusted life year&#xD;
      saved and HIV infection averted will be favorable as compared with the alternative of no&#xD;
      specific seek, test, treat and retain program directed to PWID.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HCV Among PWID in Kenya: A Supplement to the TLC-IDU study&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a global pandemic that leads to 500,000 preventable deaths&#xD;
      worldwide. People who inject drugs (PWID) are at much higher risk of HCV infection, with an&#xD;
      estimated 10 million HCV infections among PWID worldwide. In Kenya, PWID are at high risk of&#xD;
      HCV infection, yet HCV prevalence in this key population is not well-defined. The time is&#xD;
      ripe to establish HCV prevalence among high-risk PWID in Kenya, determine the role of sexual&#xD;
      transmission and risk behavior in those identified with HCV, and explore potential best&#xD;
      approaches to provide clinical and counseling services, especially to HCV-HIV co-infected&#xD;
      individuals. We therefore propose to add rapid HCV testing to our study of PWID in Kenya, the&#xD;
      NIDA-funded parent 'TLC-IDU study' (Kurth &amp; Cherutich, PIs), and to collect additional&#xD;
      specific behavioral and clinical data relevant to HCV in this high-HIV burden setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These data will provide novel and highly relevant information about HCV and HIV co-infection&#xD;
      in Kenya among PWID that will be immediately applicable to national HCV testing and treating&#xD;
      policy. Our scientific objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Supplement Specific Aim 1: Establish HCV prevalence in PWID in Nairobi, Western and Coastal&#xD;
      region, by adding a rapid HCV assay to the study panel among all participants (both HIV&#xD;
      infected and uninfected) recruited during the last TLC-IDU study waves. (The study involves&#xD;
      recruiting PWID who undergo rapid HIV testing/phenotyping and behavioral data collection, as&#xD;
      well as peer case management to support HIV treatment). Those testing positive with the HCV&#xD;
      rapid point of care assay will be given initial counseling to raise their awareness, tell&#xD;
      them they have been exposed, and encourage them to return for confirmatory results.&#xD;
      Confirmatory viral HCV testing will be done and confirmed positive participants given an&#xD;
      incentive to return to the study site for standardized HCV counseling and treatment referral&#xD;
      for those with HCV monoinfection and HIV-HCV infection. Main outcomes will include: a) HCV&#xD;
      prevalence determination b) HCV testing and counseling feasibility and acceptability&#xD;
      measures, c) unique predictors of HCV monoinfection and HIV and HCV coinfection determined in&#xD;
      multinomial logistic regression analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Supplement Specific Aim 2: Deliver HCV counseling and available treatment, including&#xD;
      sofosbuvir treatment to those eligible and collect HCV treatment adherence data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Supplement Specific Aim 3: Present study findings and program implications at a national&#xD;
      workshop with study partner NASCOP. Invite key stakeholders, researchers, and implementers to&#xD;
      discuss HCV agenda for Kenya.&#xD;
