    <textblock>
      Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a pathological condition whose progression is&#xD;
      characterized by stable periods broken up by intermittent acute exacerbations of the&#xD;
      symptoms, during which a severe inflammatory process occurs often requiring hospitalization.&#xD;
      During exacerbations the risk of death is very high making the social and economical impact&#xD;
      of such events important.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The need of rationalize the utilization of health care resources together with the&#xD;
      optimization of patient's care has prompted the development of models of assistance based on&#xD;
      home monitoring. At the present time most of the suggested models were based on the&#xD;
      utilization of diaries for symptoms perceived by the patients. Even if positive results are&#xD;
      reported in terms of reduction of in hospitalization many COPD patients tend to underestimate&#xD;
      the severity of their condition and their compliance in recording their symptoms rapidly&#xD;
      decreases with time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Attempts of using more objective measurements such as home spirometers have been done but&#xD;
      poor results were reported mainly due to the difficulties in performing a spirometric test&#xD;
      without medical supervision.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A more suitable approach to get objective information on the function of the respiratory&#xD;
      system is the Forced Oscillation Technique (FOT). Such methodology is based on the analysis&#xD;
      of the response of the system to small pressure stimuli over-imposed to the normal breathing&#xD;
      of the patients. The measurements require minimal cooperation and can be performed without&#xD;
      medical supervision.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to measure daily variability of FOT data measured at home of a&#xD;
      group of COPD patients in order to identify possible correlations between symptoms change,&#xD;
      breathing pattern, lung mechanical impedance and occurrence of exacerbation.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The continuous progresses of medical science and technology and the improvement of life&#xD;
      conditions have increased the life expectancy in industrialized countries: the result is the&#xD;
      progressive population aging [UN, 2002]. One of the consequences of this trend is the&#xD;
      increasing number of people suffering from chronic diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Among these pathologies chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is the more important&#xD;
      for number of patients and deaths affecting 80 million people in the world [WHO, 2006]. The&#xD;
      time course of the disease is characterized by stable periods broken up by intermittent acute&#xD;
      exacerbations of the symptoms, during which a severe inflammatory process occurs, leading to&#xD;
      increased airways obstruction. During exacerbations the risk of death is very high [Connors&#xD;
      et al, 1996;Soler-Cataluna et al, 2005]. Moreover the frequency and severity of exacerbations&#xD;
      correlate with the worsening of the health condition of the patient [Anzueto et al, 2009;&#xD;
      Donaldson et al, 2002].&#xD;
&#xD;
      The burden of care of patients with COPD on the national health care systems and society is&#xD;
      high. The utilization of health care resources by patients with COPD is primarily due to&#xD;
      acute exacerbations requiring care in the emergency rooms and hospital [Dal Negro, 2008] .&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the last few years the need to rationalize the health care costs has prompted to the&#xD;
      development of new technologies for the home monitoring of these patients mainly aimed at the&#xD;
      early detection of the onset of exacerbations. This could help the development of new&#xD;
      therapeutic and organizational models aimed at reducing the impact of such events on the&#xD;
      quality of life of the patient and on the national health care systems.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Published data offer several different follow-up models of home monitoring of COPD. Written&#xD;
      and electronic diaries, questionnaires, telephonic assistance by respiratory nurses or&#xD;
      specialized clinical personnel and use of web-based call centers have all been suggested for&#xD;
      the follow up of patients after discharge from hospitals. Even if positive results are&#xD;
      reported in terms of reduction of in hospitalization [Vitacca et al, 2009] many COPD patients&#xD;
      tend to underestimate the severity of their condition [Cote et al, 1998] and patient's&#xD;
      compliance in recording their symptoms rapidly decreases with time [Cote et al, 1998].&#xD;
      Moreover, other authors address the difficulty to evaluate correctly the impact of such&#xD;
      models on patient's quality of life and on the reduction of hospitalization and mortality&#xD;
      rate [Ram et al, 2004; Bolton et al, 2010].&#xD;
&#xD;
      An effective home monitoring system for COPD patients should have the following&#xD;
      characteristics:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. easy to be used in unsupervised environment,&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. able to provide sensible and objective information about patient status,&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. low cost.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinically, diagnosis and monitoring of COPD patients is based on spirometric parameters,&#xD;
      such as FEV1 (forced expiratory volume in 1 second), FVC (forced vital capacity) and FEV1/FVC&#xD;
      obtained from forced expiratory maneuvers [Gold, 2009]. However, for most patients affected&#xD;
      by COPD, it is very difficult to execute spirometry correctly because of their poor ability&#xD;
      to perform forced maneuvers. For this reason it is necessary that the test is supervised by a&#xD;
      physician [Miller et al, 2005]. Moreover, there is general belief in the medical community&#xD;
      that FEV1 is insensitive to changes over short periods of time in patients with COPD so&#xD;
      controversy surrounds the reliance of this parameter as an accurate metric for acute&#xD;
      respiratory events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These may be some of the reasons why most of the studies where patients have been monitored&#xD;
      by home spirometry or peak-flow meters have reported poor results[Brouwer et al, 2010].&#xD;
&#xD;
      A promising technology for the home monitoring of respiratory diseases is represented by the&#xD;
      Forced Oscillations Technique (FOT). FOT is based on the analysis of the response of the&#xD;
      respiratory system to external pressure stimuli superimposed to the spontaneous breathing of&#xD;
      the patient. It does not require the cooperation of the patient and it can provide accurate&#xD;
      measurements even without the supervision of specialized personnel.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the last few years new technologies based on FOT and special algorithms were developed by&#xD;
      the respiratory research group of the Bioengineering Department of the Politecnico di Milano&#xD;
      University, Italy. These methodologies have been already tested proving to be effective for&#xD;
      the automatic and quantitative evaluation of several phenomena including:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  the presence or not of Expiratory Flow Limitation (EFL) breath by breath [Dellaca' et&#xD;
           al, 2004];&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  airways resistance corrected from the artifacts introduced by EFL [Dellaca' et al,&#xD;
           2009];&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  the degree of airways heterogeneities measured by the analysis of the frequency&#xD;
           dependency of the resistance;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  the response of the respiratory system to the administration of bronchodilators and&#xD;
           bronchoconstrictors [Dellaca' et al, 2009].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently a spin-off company of respiratory group of the Bioengineering Department of the&#xD;
      Politecnico di Milano has made available a special device (RESMONPRO-diary) suitable to&#xD;
      collect data at patient's home without medical supervision. Data from a prototype device&#xD;
      recorded on asthmatic patients have shown its suitability for remote unsupervised monitoring&#xD;
      of chronic conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AIM OF THE STUDY&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the present study is to evaluate the possibility of monitoring oscillatory&#xD;
      parameters of lung mechanics, measured by the Forced Oscillation Technique (FOT), for the&#xD;
      early detection of exacerbations in COPD patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore primary outcome will be the identification of the relationship between changes in&#xD;
      patient's symptoms, breathing pattern, lung mechanical impedance indices and occurrence of&#xD;
      and exacerbation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A further outcome of the study will be the identification and classification of the occurred&#xD;
      exacerbations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY PROTOCOL&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pre-study measurements:&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the enrollment in the study, every subject will be visited by physician and will&#xD;
      undergo a standard pulmonary function test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Moreover the following data will be collected:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  exacerbation history&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  smoking history&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  disease history&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  presence of co-morbidities&#xD;
&#xD;
      Daily home monitoring program:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will be monitored at home using a device for oscillometric measurement of lung&#xD;
      functionality (RESMON pro).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The duration of the measurement will be 2-3 minutes once a day for a period comprised between&#xD;
      6 and 8 months. At the beginning of the measurement the device will ask the patient to fill a&#xD;
      simple questionnaire for self-evaluation of their symptoms (dyspnoea, amount and purulence of&#xD;
      sputum, wheeze, cough). For the duration of the study, the participant will be asked to wear&#xD;
      an Actiwatch Spectrum 24 hours a day. The Actiwatch Spectrum, a small watch-like device,&#xD;
      measures activity by recording and analyzing the readings from the on-board accelerometer.&#xD;
      Each 1-minute activity epoch is analyzed and the statistical results stored in the on-board&#xD;
      memory which can hold up to six-months of data. The Actigraphy data provides an objective&#xD;
      record of activity and has been validated to determine normal and abnormal sleep / wake&#xD;
      patterns.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A nurse will perform a weekly phone interview in order to collect information about presence&#xD;
      and timing of the following events:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Change in current drug therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Systemic steroids use/prescription&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Antibiotic use/prescription&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Hospitalization due to respiratory causes&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Emergency Room admission&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Unscheduled GP call&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Unscheduled GP visit&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Specialist visit&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Worsening in sleep&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Worsening in dyspnea during daily life activity&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Fever&#xD;
&#xD;
      DATA ANALYSIS&#xD;
&#xD;
      The time-series data and their variability will be analyzed using the method of the time&#xD;
      irreversibility, sample and multiscale entropy, and Gumbel's extreme values statistic. The&#xD;
      predictor of an exacerbation will then be derived by calculating the conditional probability&#xD;
      of having a future acute event given the trend or the variability of indices derived from the&#xD;
      above methods. Additionally data will be analyzed also using a deterministic approach: linear&#xD;
      and non-linear modelling analysis&#xD;
