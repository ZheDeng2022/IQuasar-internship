  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Subjects have a type of lymph gland disease called Hodgkin or non-Hodgkin Lymphoma or&#xD;
      T/NK-lymphoproliferative disease or severe chronic active Epstein Barr Virus (CAEBV) which&#xD;
      has come back, is at risk of coming back, or has not gone away after treatment, including the&#xD;
      best treatment we know for these diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Some of these patients show signs of virus that is called Epstein Barr virus (EBV) that&#xD;
      causes mononucleosis or glandular fever (&quot;mono&quot; or the &quot;kissing disease&quot;) before or at the&#xD;
      time of their diagnosis. EBV is found in the cancer cells of up to half the patients with HD&#xD;
      and NHL, suggesting that it may play a role in causing Lymphoma. The cancer cells and some&#xD;
      immune system cells infected by EBV are able to hide from the body's immune system and escape&#xD;
      destruction. We want to see if special white blood cells, called GRALE T cells, that have&#xD;
      been trained to kill EBV infected cells can survive in the blood and affect the tumor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We have used this sort of therapy to treat a different type of cancer called post transplant&#xD;
      lymphoma. In this type of cancer the tumor cells have 9 proteins made by EBV on their&#xD;
      surface. We grew T cells in the lab that recognized all 9 proteins and were able to&#xD;
      successfully prevent and treat post transplant lymphoma. However, in HD and NHL,&#xD;
      T/NK-lymphoproliferative disease, and CAEBV, the tumor cells and B cells only express 4 EBV&#xD;
      proteins. In a previous study, we made T cells that recognized all 9 proteins and gave them&#xD;
      to patients with HD. Some patients had a partial response to this therapy but no patients had&#xD;
      a complete response. We then did follow up studies where we made T cells that recognized the&#xD;
      2 EBV proteins seen in patients with lymphoma, T/NK-lymphoproliferative disease and CAEBV. We&#xD;
      have treated over 50 people on those studies. About 60% of those patients who had disease at&#xD;
      the time they got the cells had responses including some patients with complete responses.&#xD;
      This study will expand on those results and we will try and make the T cells in the lab in a&#xD;
      simpler faster way. These cells are called GRALE T cells. These GRALE T cells are an&#xD;
      investigational product not approved by the FDA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to find the largest safe dose of LMP-specific cytotoxic GRALE T&#xD;
      cells created using this new manufacturing technique. We will learn what the side effects are&#xD;
      and to see whether this therapy might help patients with HD or NHL or EBV associated&#xD;
      T/NK-lymphoproliferative disease or CAEBV.&#xD;

      Subjects (or their syngeneic donor) will give blood for investigators to make EBV-specific&#xD;
      (GRALE) T cells in the lab. These cells will be grown and frozen for the subject.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The GRALE T cells will then be thawed and injected into the subject over 1-10 minutes.&#xD;
      Initially, two doses of GRALE T cells will be given 2 weeks apart.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If after the 2nd infusion there is a reduction in the size of the lymphoma on CT or MRI scan&#xD;
      as assessed by a radiologist, the subject can receive additional doses of the GRALE T cells&#xD;
      if they wish (up to 6 times). Follow up testing will be collected just like after the 1st&#xD;
      infusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All of the treatments will be given by the Center for Cell and Gene Therapy at Texas&#xD;
      Children's Hospital or Houston Methodist Hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will follow the subjects after the injections. They will either be seen in the clinic or&#xD;
      the subject will be contacted by a research nurse yearly for 5 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If they receive additional doses of the GRALE T cells as described above, they will be&#xD;
      followed until 5 years after the last dose of GRALE T-cells.&#xD;
