  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective is to determine the safety and survival of the redirected allogeneic T&#xD;
      cells transduced with the anti-CD19 lentiviral vector (referred to as CART-19 cells).&#xD;

      The investigators propose an open label, single center, pilot study to evaluate the safety&#xD;
      and tolerability, and persistence of donor lymphocytes engineered to express a chimeric&#xD;
      antigen receptor targeting CD19 which is linked to the CD3:4-1BB signaling chains in patients&#xD;
      with CD19+ acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Upon enrollment, donors will undergo&#xD;
      leukapheresis and patients will undergo an optional bone marrow/lymph node biopsy&#xD;
      approximately four weeks prior to dosing. Between dosing and treatment, patients may undergo&#xD;
      an additional chemotherapy treatment depending upon their disease. At dosing, patients will&#xD;
      receive redirected donor lymphocytes targeted against CD19 (allo-CART-19 cells). The cell&#xD;
      dose will be given as a split infusion over three days to enhance the ability to manage any&#xD;
      infusion related toxicity. Patients will be monitored weekly for four weeks. At the end of&#xD;
      four weeks, patients will undergo a second leukapheresis and second optional bone&#xD;
      marrow/lymph node biopsy. At this point the patient will also undergo restaging. Observation&#xD;
      and monitoring of patients will continue on a monthly basis until week 24 post dosing. Annual&#xD;
      follow-up for lentiviral vector safety will be carried out for 15 years in accordance with&#xD;
      FDA guidelines for retroviral vectors. Ten subjects will be targeted for this study, with an&#xD;
      expected rate of drop out of 30% due to disease progression between enrollment and week four&#xD;
      post dosing.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Creatinine less than or equal to2.5 mg/dl.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  ALT/AST less than or equal to3x normal&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Bilirubin less than or equal to2.0 mg/dl&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Donor is available and is able to undergo apheresis. A separate donor consent process&#xD;
             and form is described below.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Voluntary informed consent is given.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant or lactating women. The safety of this therapy on unborn children is not&#xD;
             known. Female study participants of reproductive potential must have a negative serum&#xD;
             or urine pregnancy test performed within 48 hours before infusion.&#xD;

             CD3/CD28 costimulation..&#xD;
&#xD;
