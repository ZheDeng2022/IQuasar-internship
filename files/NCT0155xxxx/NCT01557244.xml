  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of the study is to find out if the medicine fesoterodine is a useful treatment&#xD;
      in children with bladder muscle overactivity caused by a neurological condition. Children&#xD;
      will be aged 6 to 17 years old. This is done by finding out how well it works, what the body&#xD;
      does to fesoterodine, what side effects are experienced and the safety of fesoterodine. It&#xD;
      will be compared with the medicine oxybutynin, which is already available for treating the&#xD;
      condition.&#xD;

It consisted of a small board of 25 holes with randomly positioned slots. Pegs with a key along one side must be rotated to match the hole before they can be inserted. Participants were asked to insert 25 grooved pegs into the holes within the given time limit (up to 300 seconds). In this outcome measure number of pegs placed correctly while putting in the holes were measured. The task needs to be completed once for each hand; firstly, using the dominant hand followed by the non-dominant hand.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Mean Number of Micturitions Per 24 Hours at Week 12: Active Comparator Phase/Efficacy Phase</title>
        <description>The mean number of micturitions per 24 hours were calculated as the total number of micturitions divided by the total number of diary days collected at the assessment time point. Number of diary days collected at the assessment time point = number of calendar days when the diary was completed on, even if it was not a full 24 hour period. This outcome measure was only calculated for participants with &gt;0 micturitions at Baseline.</description>

        <description>An AE was any untoward medical occurrence in a participant who received investigational product without regard to possibility of causal relationship. SAE was an AE resulting in any of the following outcomes or deemed significant for any other reason: death; initial or prolonged inpatient hospitalization; life-threatening experience (immediate risk of dying); persistent or significant disability/incapacity; congenital anomaly; medically important events. A treatment emergent AE was defined as an event that emerged during the treatment period that was absent before treatment, or worsened during the treatment period relative to the pretreatment state.

        <title>Change From Baseline in Visual Acuity at Week 12: Active Comparator Phase/Efficacy Phase</title>
        <description>Visual acuity (VA) was assessed using the Snellen method, where logarithm of minimum angle of resolution (logMAR) units were derived from the Snellen ratios. Participants had to read letters from the chart at a distance of 20 feet/6 meter or 4 meter. VA/Snellen ratio = distance between the chart and participant, divided by the distance at which participant was able to see or read chart without impairment; expressed as decimal. logMAR = log10 (1/decimal VA). In this outcome measure data have been reported for right and left eye separately.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Visual Accommodation at Week 12: Active Comparator Phase/Efficacy Phase</title>
        <description>The visual accommodation was the distance for each eye at which vision became blurred and was calculated as the mean of triplicate measurements. The participants focused on a single letter of the 20/40 line of an eye chart and chart was moved slowly towards the participant until letter was blurred. At this point, the distance from eye to letter was measured for each eye. In this outcome measure data have been reported for right and left eye separately.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) T Score (Derived Score) at Week 12: Active Comparator Phase/Efficacy Phase</title>
        <description>CBCL: 120 items questionnaire answered by parent/caregiver of child to assess a child's behavioral, emotional problems. Scale for each item: 0= not true, 1= somewhat/sometimes true, 2= very true/often true. Out of 120 items, 103 were categorized into 8 domains; aggressive behavior, anxious/depressed, attention problems, rule-breaking behavior, social problems, somatic complaints, thought problems, withdrawn. Summary scores: Internalizing problems=anxious/depressed + withdrawn + somatic complaints; Externalizing problems=rule-breaking + aggressive behavior. Total problems=8 domains + other 17 items. Raw scores for each domain, summary and total problems=sum of scores of related items. Using Assessment Data Manager (ADM) tool raw scores transformed/derived into standard T-scores, range: each domain=50 to 100, internalizing problems=34 to 100, externalizing problems=33 to 100, total problems=24 to 100. Lower T-score for each 8 domains, 2 summary and total problems scores=better outcomes.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) T Score (Derived Score) at Week 24: Safety Extension Phase</title>
        <description>CBCL: 120 items questionnaire answered by parent/caregiver of child to assess a child's behavioral, emotional problems. Scale for each item: 0= not true, 1= somewhat/sometimes true, 2= very true/often true. Out of 120 items, 103 were categorized into 8 domains; aggressive behavior, anxious/depressed, attention problems, rule-breaking behavior, social problems, somatic complaints, thought problems, withdrawn. Summary scores: Internalizing problems=anxious/depressed + withdrawn + somatic complaints; Externalizing problems=rule-breaking + aggressive behavior. Total problems=8 domains + other 17 items. Raw scores for each domain, summary and total problems=sum of scores of related items. Using Assessment Data Manager (ADM) tool raw scores transformed/derived into standard T-scores, range: each domain=50 to 100, internalizing problems=34 to 100, externalizing problems=33 to 100, total problems=24 to 100. Lower T-score for each 8 domains, 2 summary and total problems scores=better outcomes.</description>

        <description>CBCL: It consisted of 120 items on behavior and emotional problems. Parent/caregiver of child answered 120 items, each on scale: 0= not true, 1= somewhat/sometimes true, 2= very/often true. 103 items were classified in 8 domains: aggressive behavior: total score range (TSR)= 0 to 36, anxious/depressed: TSR= 0 to 26, attention problems: TSR= 0 to 20, rule-breaking behavior: TSR= 0 to 34, social problems: TSR= 0 to 22, somatic complaints: TSR= 0 to 22, thought problems: TSR= 0 to 30, withdrawn (TSR)= 0 to 16. Rule-breaking and aggressive behavior summarized to externalizing problems with a TSR= 0 to 70. Anxious/depressed, withdrawn, somatic complaints summarized to internalizing problems with a TSR= 0 to 64. All 103 items of 8 domains and other 17 remaining items were combined to give total problems TSR = 0 to 240. TSR for each domain, summary and total problems was sum of scores of related items respectively. Lower scores for each domain, summary and total problems= better outcomes.</description>

        <description>CBCL: It consisted of 120 items on behavior and emotional problems. Parent/caregiver of child answered 120 items, each on scale: 0= not true, 1= somewhat/sometimes true, 2= very/often true. 103 items were classified in 8 domains: aggressive behavior: total score range (TSR)= 0 to 36, anxious/depressed: TSR= 0 to 26, attention problems: TSR= 0 to 20, rule-breaking behavior: TSR= 0 to 34, social problems: TSR= 0 to 22, somatic complaints: TSR= 0 to 22, thought problems: TSR= 0 to 30, withdrawn (TSR)= 0 to 16. Rule-breaking and aggressive behavior summarized to externalizing problems with a TSR= 0 to 70. Anxious/depressed, withdrawn, somatic complaints summarized to internalizing problems with a TSR= 0 to 64. All 103 items of 8 domains and other 17 remaining items were combined to give total problems TSR = 0 to 240. TSR for each domain, summary and total problems was sum of scores of related items respectively. Lower scores for each domain, summary and total problems= better outcomes.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Time to Completion Assessment of Grooved Pegboard Test, 10 Pegs Group at Week 12: Active Comparator Phase/Efficacy Phase</title>
        <description>The grooved pegboard test was a manipulative dexterity test that assessed psychomotor speed, fine motor control, and rapid-visual motor coordination. It consisted of a small board of 25 holes with randomly positioned slots. Pegs with a key along one side must be rotated to match the hole before they can be inserted. In this outcome measure participants were asked to insert 10 grooved pegs into the holes within the given time limit (up to 300 seconds). The task needs to be completed once for each hand; firstly, using the dominant hand followed by the non-dominant hand. Time taken to complete the test was inversely correlated to the cognitive ability.</description>

There was 1 participant who inadvertently did the 10-peg test with non-dominant hand and 25-peg test with dominant hand. This participant was counted in both 10 peg and 25 peg assessment.</population>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Time to Completion Assessment of Grooved Pegboard Test, 25 Pegs Group at Week 12: Active Comparator Phase/Efficacy Phase</title>
        <description>The grooved pegboard test was a manipulative dexterity test that assessed psychomotor speed, fine motor control, and rapid-visual motor coordination. It consisted of a small board of 25 holes with randomly positioned slots. Pegs with a key along one side must be rotated to match the hole before they can be inserted. In this outcome measure participants were asked to insert 25 grooved pegs into the holes within the given time limit (up to 300 seconds). The task needs to be completed once for each hand; firstly, using the dominant hand followed by the non-dominant hand. Time taken to complete the test was inversely correlated to the cognitive ability.</description>

There was 1 participant who inadvertently did the 10-peg test with non-dominant hand and 25-peg test with dominant hand.

        <title>Change From Baseline in Number of Pegs Dropped Assessment of Grooved Pegboard Test, 10 Pegs Group at Week 12: Active Comparator Phase/Efficacy Phase</title>
        <description>The grooved pegboard test was a manipulative dexterity test that assessed psychomotor speed, fine motor control, and rapid-visual motor coordination. It consisted of a small board of 25 holes with randomly positioned slots. Pegs with a key along one side must be rotated to match the hole before they can be inserted. Participants were asked to insert 10 grooved pegs into the holes within the given time limit (up to 300 seconds). In this outcome measure number of pegs dropped while putting in the holes were measured. The task needs to be completed once for each hand; firstly, using the dominant hand followed by the non-dominant hand.</description>

There was 1 participant who inadvertently did the 10-peg test with non-dominant hand and 25-peg test with dominant hand.

        <title>Change From Baseline in Number of Pegs Dropped Assessment of Grooved Pegboard Test, 25 Pegs Group at Week 12: Active Comparator Phase/Efficacy Phase</title>
        <description>The grooved pegboard test was a manipulative dexterity test that assessed psychomotor speed, fine motor control, and rapid-visual motor coordination. It consisted of a small board of 25 holes with randomly positioned slots. Pegs with a key along one side must be rotated to match the hole before they can be inserted. Participants were asked to insert 25 grooved pegs into the holes within the given time limit (up to 300 seconds). In this outcome measure number of pegs dropped while putting in the holes were measured. The task needs to be completed once for each hand; firstly, using the dominant hand followed by the non-dominant hand.</description>

There was 1 participant who inadvertently did the 10-peg test with non-dominant hand and 25-peg test with dominant hand. This participant was counted in both 10 peg and 25 peg assessment.</population>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Number of Pegs Placed Correctly Assessment of Grooved Pegboard Test, 10 Pegs Group at Week 12: Active Comparator Phase/Efficacy Phase</title>
        <description>The grooved pegboard test was a manipulative dexterity test that assessed psychomotor speed, fine motor control, and rapid-visual motor coordination. It consisted of a small board of 25 holes with randomly positioned slots. Pegs with a key along one side must be rotated to match the hole before they can be inserted. Participants were asked to insert 10 grooved pegs into the holes within the given time limit (up to 300 seconds). In this outcome measure number of pegs placed correctly while putting in the holes were measured. The task needs to be completed once for each hand; firstly, using the dominant hand followed by the non-dominant hand.</description>

          <title>Change From Baseline in Number of Pegs Placed Correctly Assessment of Grooved Pegboard Test, 10 Pegs Group at Week 24: Safety Extension Phase</title>
          <description>The grooved pegboard test was a manipulative dexterity test that assessed psychomotor speed, fine motor control, and rapid-visual motor coordination. It consisted of a small board of 25 holes with randomly positioned slots. Pegs with a key along one side must be rotated to match the hole before they can be inserted. Participants were asked to insert 10 grooved pegs into the holes within the given time limit (up to 300 seconds). In this outcome measure number of pegs placed correctly while putting in the holes were measured. The task needs to be completed once for each hand; firstly, using the dominant hand followed by the non-dominant hand.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Number of Pegs Placed Correctly Assessment of Grooved Pegboard Test, 25 Pegs Group at Week 24: Safety Extension Phase</title>
        <description>The grooved pegboard test was a manipulative dexterity test that assessed psychomotor speed, fine motor control, and rapid-visual motor coordination. It consisted of a small board of 25 holes with randomly positioned slots. Pegs with a key along one side must be rotated to match the hole before they can be inserted. Participants were asked to insert 25 grooved pegs into the holes within the given time limit (up to 300 seconds). In this outcome measure number of pegs placed correctly while putting in the holes were measured. The task needs to be completed once for each hand; firstly, using the dominant hand followed by the non-dominant hand.</description>

          <title>Change From Baseline in Number of Pegs Placed Correctly Assessment of Grooved Pegboard Test, 25 Pegs Group at Week 24: Safety Extension Phase</title>
          <description>The grooved pegboard test was a manipulative dexterity test that assessed psychomotor speed, fine motor control, and rapid-visual motor coordination. It consisted of a small board of 25 holes with randomly positioned slots. Pegs with a key along one side must be rotated to match the hole before they can be inserted. Participants were asked to insert 25 grooved pegs into the holes within the given time limit (up to 300 seconds). In this outcome measure number of pegs placed correctly while putting in the holes were measured. The task needs to be completed once for each hand; firstly, using the dominant hand followed by the non-dominant hand.</description>
