  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the concentration of JNJ-39393406 achieved in the&#xD;
      blood and cerebrospinal fluid of healthy adult volunteers following administration of a&#xD;
      single dose of JNJ-39393406.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-centre, double-blind (neither physician nor patient knows the name of the&#xD;
      assigned treatment), single dose study of JNJ-39393406 or placebo (a treatment identical in&#xD;
      appearance to JNJ-39393406 but does not contain active drug) in healthy adult volunteers. The&#xD;
      study consists of an eligibility screening examination (between 21 and 2 days prior to dose&#xD;
      administration), a double-blind treatment period, and a follow-up examination (minimally 7&#xD;
      and maximally 14 days after the dose administration). For each volunteer, the maximal study&#xD;
      duration will not exceed 6 weeks. JNJ-39393406 or placebo will be administered as a single&#xD;
      200-mg dose on Day 1 as a liquid nanosuspension (a formulation used to improve the solubility&#xD;
      of the drug) with 240 mL (approximately 8 ounces or 1 cup) noncarbonated water between 8:00&#xD;
      AM and 10:30 AM after a standard breakfast has been consumed (following a fast [not eating&#xD;
      food] of at least 10 hours). Volunteers will then fast until approximately 4 hours after&#xD;
      taking JNJ-3939406 or placebo after which lunch will be served.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Female volunteers must be postmenopausal (for at least 12 months)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Body mass index (BMI) between 18 and 29.9 kg/m2, inclusive&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Healthy on the basis of physical examination, neurological examination, medical&#xD;
             history, vital signs, and 12-lead ECG [including QTcB interval duration &lt;450 msec]&#xD;
             performed at screening. Minor deviations in ECG, which are not considered to be of&#xD;
             clinical significance to the investigator, are acceptable&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Healthy on the basis of clinical laboratory tests performed at screening. If the&#xD;
             results of the serum chemistry panel [including liver enzymes], hematology, or&#xD;
             urinalysis are outside the normal reference ranges, the volunteer may be included only&#xD;
             if the investigator judges the abnormalities or deviations from normal to be not&#xD;
             clinically significant&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of liver or renal insufficiency&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  significant cardiac, vascular, pulmonary, gastrointestinal, endocrine, neurologic,&#xD;
             hematologic, rheumatologic, psychiatric, or metabolic disturbances&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Relevant history of or current neurological disease including any history of post&#xD;
             dural puncture headache, lower back pain or scoliosis and/or major (lumbar) back&#xD;
             surgery, spontaneous, prolonged or severe bleeding with unclear origin, epilepsy or&#xD;
             fits or unexplained black-outs&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History or family history of abnormal bleeding or of blood clotting or anemia&#xD;
