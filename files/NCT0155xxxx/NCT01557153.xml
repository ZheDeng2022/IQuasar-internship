      Depression has a high occurrence and causes other problems in older people, two thirds of&#xD;
      these patients will not have a lessening in their condition from routine treatment&#xD;
      medication. About half have a form of depression known as 'vascular depression'.&#xD;
      Augmentation, the addition to, antidepressant treatment with a vascular type of treatment&#xD;
      (such as a group of medications called Calcium Channel Blocker including the medication&#xD;
      called amlodipine) may be effective in this group of patients but previously published&#xD;
      studies have been from highly selected specific patient groups. The investigators would like&#xD;
      to find out if giving amlodipine medication to people with late life non-responding vascular&#xD;
      depression would be acceptable to this patient group. The investigators would also like to&#xD;
      know how they feel while having the treatment and whether this provides a measurable benefit&#xD;
      for those patients and whether those benefits are relevant to the patients. The investigators&#xD;
      would also like to find out the information the investigators need to plan and prepare for a&#xD;
      larger version of this study.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Depression has a high prevalence and causes other problems in older people. Two-thirds of&#xD;
      these patients will not have an improvement in their condition from routine treatment. About&#xD;
      hald have a form of depression known as 'Vascular Depression'. Augmentation, in this case the&#xD;
      addition to antidepressant treatment of a vascular type of treatment (such as a group of&#xD;
      medications called Calcium Channel Blockers including the medication called amlodipine) may&#xD;
      be effective in this group of patients but previously published studies have been from highly&#xD;
      selected specific patient groups. We would like to find out if giving amlodipine medication&#xD;
      to people with late life non-responding vascular depression would be acceptable to this&#xD;
      patient group. We would also like to know how they feel while having the treatment and&#xD;
      whether this provides a measureable benefit for those patients and whether those benefits are&#xD;
      relevant to the patients. We would also like to find out the information we need to plan and&#xD;
      prepare for a larger version of this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants may be eligible for the study if they are 50 years old or over, and have been&#xD;
      diagnosed with depression which has not gotten better with other drugs, we call this type of&#xD;
      depression 'Vascular Depression'.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If a participant would like to be involved in this study, they would be required to attend&#xD;
      the Clinical Ageing Research Unit (CARU) at the former Newcastle General Hospital site in&#xD;
      Newcastle upon Tyne for up to seven visits as part of this clinical trial, and would be&#xD;
      required to take the study medication prescribed to them. The study medication may be either&#xD;
      amlodipine or placebo, however neither the participant nor the doctor or nurses involved in&#xD;
      the study will be aware of which medication has been given. This is called a double blind&#xD;
      study, and is done to ensure that there is no other influence on the results apart from the&#xD;
      effects of the drug itself. Each participant will be randomly assigned to receiving either&#xD;
      amlodipine or placebo in a process called randomisation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As part of this study, participants will be invited to attend the unit mentioned above for&#xD;
      their study visit, the first of which will be to discuss this study in further detail and&#xD;
      allowing the participant time to ask any questions and to consider their participation in the&#xD;
      study. If they would like to be involved, they will be invited to return for a second visit&#xD;
      at which time they will be asked to give their consent to be involved in the study. They will&#xD;
      then need to have their blood pressure taken, have an ECG (electrocardiograph) to establish&#xD;
      how well their heart is working, have a small blood sample taken and complete four short&#xD;
      questionnaires.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following on from this, the participant will be invited back for another visit, which will&#xD;
      also be used to confirm the participants eligibility. At this visit the participant will be&#xD;
      required to have a physical examination from the study doctor, have their blood pressure&#xD;
      checked and complete the nine short questionnaires. Once a participant has been confirmed as&#xD;
      eligible for the study, they will be entered into the study and randomised to receive either&#xD;
      amlodipine or placebo. The participant will then receive four weeks supply of the study&#xD;
      medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two weeks after this visit, and again at 6 weeks and 12 weeks into the study, each&#xD;
      participant will be contacted by the research study nurses in order to review how the&#xD;
      participant has been since their last visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At weeks 4 and 8 of the study, participants will be required to attend the research centre&#xD;
      for another visit at which point they will be asked to complete two short questionnaires,&#xD;
      have their blood pressure taken and current medication reviewed, and will receive their next&#xD;
      supply of study medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At 16 weeks after starting the study, study medication will be stopped and participants will&#xD;
      be asked to attend another visit at which time current medication will be reviewed, blood&#xD;
      pressure will be assessed, as well as a blood sample will be taken. Participants will also be&#xD;
      asked to complete eight short questionnaires. Depending on the results of these&#xD;
      questionnaires, participants may be asked to attend for another visit a week later at which&#xD;
      point their blood pressure will be taken again, and they will be asked to complete six short&#xD;
      questionnaires.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At 20 weeks after the start of the study, patients will be asked to return for a final visit&#xD;
      at which point they will be asked to complete two short questionnaires and have their blood&#xD;
      pressure taken once more.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following on from this study, participants will be returned to the care of their GP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As part of this study, participants will also be invited to take part in an interview, which&#xD;
      will involve the discussion of the various questionnaires undertaken in the study and any&#xD;
      other concerns the participant may have had during the course of the study. These interviews&#xD;
      will be optional and not be a required part of the study, should the participant decline to&#xD;
      take part in the interviews they will still be able to remain in the main part of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is no guarantee that taking part in this study may benefit the participant, however it&#xD;
      is anticipated that the active medication could reduce the symptoms of their depression. The&#xD;
      risk involved in participating in this study is very small, and may include the small risk of&#xD;
      bruising or infection at the site where the blood sample was taken. Other risks include the&#xD;
      possible side effects of the study drug (amlodipine) which may include swelling of the&#xD;
      ankles, dizziness, fatigue, nausea, indigestion, palpitations or headaches. These, and other&#xD;
      side effects, are listed in the Patient Information sheet which will be given to each&#xD;
      potential participant for further information.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Potential participants will be identified at their GP practices which will be involved in the&#xD;
      study as Participant Identification Centres (PICs).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is being sponsored by Gateshead Health NHS Foundation Trust, and is funded by the&#xD;
      National Institute for Health Research - Research for Patient Benefit. The study will start&#xD;
      around the 1st April 2012 and will run for approximately 24 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main contact for any potential participant for this study will be Julie Henry (Research&#xD;
      Nurse) based at the Clinical Ageing Research Unit, Campus for Ageing and Vitality, Newcastle&#xD;
      upon Tyne, NE4 5PL, Telephone: 0191 248 1280 (reception)&#xD;
