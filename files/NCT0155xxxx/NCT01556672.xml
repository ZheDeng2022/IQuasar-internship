  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will determine the prevalence of small bowel lesions suggestive of Crohn's disease&#xD;
      (CD) in patients with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis using capsule endoscopy. The study&#xD;
      also aims to determine if the treatment of psoriasis with adalimumab will have an effect on&#xD;
      the healing of the small bowel for patients who have lesions suggestive of CD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with psoriasis are at increased risk of developing Crohn's disease (CD), but the&#xD;
      exact prevalence of CD in patients with psoriasis at this time is unknown as many patients&#xD;
      probably have undiagnosed disease as the early signs will often cause no symptoms. CD is&#xD;
      therefore receiving very little attention from dermatologists who are treating patients with&#xD;
      psoriasis. For example, very few dermatologists will actively question patients with&#xD;
      psoriasis about symptoms of CD. This lack of knowledge may induce delays in diagnosis. By the&#xD;
      time the diagnosis is made and patients receive their first treatment, they may already have&#xD;
      significant fibrosis and stenosis of the intestine. Current treatments, including adalimumab,&#xD;
      cannot reverse small bowel anomalies to normal in the presence of fibrosis. Therefore, many&#xD;
      patients with a late diagnosis will still have symptoms or will eventually require surgery&#xD;
      despite good control of the inflammation. Treatment of CD should start as early as possible,&#xD;
      as early treatment has been associated with an increased rate of complete healing. Complete&#xD;
      control of the disease at its early stages may prevent complications.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This open-label, phase IV, 24-week study will recruit a total of 100 patients with moderate&#xD;
      to severe plaque psoriasis without a diagnosis of inflammatory bowel disease. All patients&#xD;
      will undergo capsule endoscopy at the beginning of the study to detect the presence of small&#xD;
      bowel lesions suggestive of CD such as erosions and ulcers. All patients will receive&#xD;
      adalimumab 80 mg followed by 40 mg at week 1 and 40 mg every other week (EOW) thereafter.&#xD;
      Patients for whom no small bowel lesions suggestive of CD were detected will remain in the&#xD;
      study and under adalimumab therapy until week 12. A second capsule endoscopy will be&#xD;
      performed 24 weeks after initiation of adalimumab for patients who had small bowel lesions&#xD;
      suggestive of CD to evaluate changes in bowel inflammation.&#xD;
