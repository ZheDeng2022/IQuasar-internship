      Systemic sclerosis (SSc, scleroderma) is a multisystem autoimmune rheumatic disease that&#xD;
      causes inﬂammation, vascular damage and ﬁbrosis. Besides involvement of skin, fibrosis also&#xD;
      affects lung and heart. Although advances in understanding in pathophysiology and use of&#xD;
      immunosuppressive therapy has brought significant improvement in outcome of other autoimmune&#xD;
      diseases, scleroderma still remains as a disease with high mortality and 10 yr survival rate&#xD;
      has improved only from 54% to 66% during last 25 years1. The frequency of deaths due to renal&#xD;
      crisis significantly decreased (mainly due to effectiveness of ACE Inhibitors), from 42% to&#xD;
      6% of scleroderma-related deaths (p 0.001), whereas the proportion of patients with&#xD;
      scleroderma who died of pulmonary fibrosis increased (due to lack of significant treatment)&#xD;
      from 6% to 33% (p 0.001). However, presently, trials with immunosuppressive drugs including&#xD;
      cyclophosphamide and other targeted molecules like Bosentan and Imatinib mesylate have shown&#xD;
      very modest results at the best and given the risk of toxicity. The investigators have&#xD;
      conducted three clinical trials with PDE5 inhibitor Tadalafil in the refractory Raynaud's&#xD;
      phenomenon (RP) in SSc over last 3 years and had found good response in RP, healing of&#xD;
      digital ulcers, prevention of new digital ulcers and also observed improvement in skin&#xD;
      tightening, endothelial dysfunction and improvement of quality of life. The investigators&#xD;
      therefore hypothesize that tadalafil may have an efficacy in improving the ILD of SSc.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators therefore design this double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial of&#xD;
      oral Tadalafil (20 mg alternate day) in patients with SSc having ILD. Patients will be&#xD;
      randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive either Tadalafil or matched placebo and will be&#xD;
      followed up for 6 months. Prednisolone (if required for indications other than ILD) will be&#xD;
      allowed up to 10 mg/d in all patients. Patient/s requiring more than 10 mg/d of prednisolone&#xD;
      or equivalent dose of steroid will be excluded from the study. Patients who will fail on&#xD;
      therapy during the study will be excluded from the study and will be asked to choose any&#xD;
      therapeutic option from the rescue protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with FVC ≤ 70% predicted or DLCO ≤ 70 % of predicted, Evidence of ILD on HRCT will&#xD;
      be enrolled. The primary objective of the study will be the change in FVC (expressed as a&#xD;
      percentage of the predicted value) from baseline values at the end of 6-months of treatment.&#xD;
      The secondary objectives will be improvement in dyspnea, improvement in 6 min walk distance,&#xD;
      change in DLCO, change in total lung capacity, change in the disability index of the Health&#xD;
      Assessment Questionnaire (S HAQ), and change quality of life (SF-36), levels of NT pro-BNP&#xD;
      and fibrosis markers.&#xD;

      Systemic sclerosis (SSc, scleroderma) is a multisystem autoimmune rheumatic disease that&#xD;
      causes inﬂammation, vascular damage and ﬁbrosis. Besides involvement of skin, fibrosis also&#xD;
      affects many internal organ involving blood vessel, lungs, heart, kidney etc. Although&#xD;
      advances in understanding in pathophysiology and use of immunosuppressive therapy has brought&#xD;
      significant improvement in outcome of other autoimmune diseases, scleroderma still remains as&#xD;
      a disease with high mortality and 10 yr survival rate has improved only from 54% to 66%&#xD;
      during last 25 years1. But there is a significant change in pattern of cause of mortality&#xD;
      over these years. The frequency of deaths due to renal crisis significantly decreased (mainly&#xD;
      due to effectiveness of ACE Inhibitors), from 42% to 6% of scleroderma-related deaths (p&#xD;
      0.001), whereas the proportion of patients with scleroderma who died of pulmonary fibrosis&#xD;
      increased (due to lack of significant treatment) from 6% to 33% (p 0.001). The frequency of&#xD;
      pulmonary hypertension, independent of PF, also significantly increased during this time&#xD;
      period (p&lt;0.05)1. Presently PAH and interstitial lung disease accounts for majority of&#xD;
      scleroderma related deaths. This emphasizes the need of novel therapies for interstitial lung&#xD;
      disease in scleroderma, in order to improve the mortality and morbidity outcome of these&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The ﬁbrosis of the skin and internal organs in SSc is believed to be caused by the transition&#xD;
      of quiescent ﬁbroblasts to activated myofibroblasts, which characteristically overproduce&#xD;
      dermal ﬁbrillar collagen (type I, III, V), collagen-modifying enzymes and other extracellular&#xD;
      matrix (ECM) components2. One of the major cytokines involved in this process is transforming&#xD;
      growth factor TGF β1 3. TGF-β is normally secreted as a latent complex, which is required to&#xD;
      be activated in extracellular regions before binding its receptors and exerting its&#xD;
      biological effects. In dermal ﬁbroblasts, several membrane proteins, including integrin αVβ5&#xD;
      and thrombospondin 1(TSP1), catalyze the activation of latent TGF-β in the local&#xD;
      microenvironment4,5. Binding of TGF-β to type II receptors (TRII) recruits type I receptors&#xD;
      (TRI) and activates a series of signaling transduction pathways including the core Smad&#xD;
      pathway (canonical pathway) and the non-Smad pathways (mitogen-activated protein kinase&#xD;
      [MAPK], Rho, etc). TRI phosphorylates Smad3 at the S423/S425 within the C-terminal MH2. The&#xD;
      activated pSmad3 binds with Smad4 to form the activated heteromeric Smad complex. The&#xD;
      pSmad3/Smad4complexes enter the nucleus and associate with other transcription factors to&#xD;
      regulate transcriptions of target genes required for collagen synthesis, myofibroblasts&#xD;
      transformation and synthesis of matrix metalloproteinases6.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Studies of cyclophosphamide have shown inconsistent result on pulmonary function and&#xD;
      survival. In the Scleroderma Lung Study (oral cyclophosphomide), there was only modest&#xD;
      improvement in dyspnoea score, stabilization (no improvement) of FVC and no effect on DLCO at&#xD;
      1 year 7. At 2 years, there is no significant difference between any of these parameters&#xD;
      between placebo and treatment group8. In a decision analysis using the Markov model to assess&#xD;
      quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), authors conclude that there is no survival or quality of&#xD;
      life benefit with oral cyclophosphamide9. Subsequent, Fibrosing Alveolitis in Scleroderma&#xD;
      Trial (FAST) [intravenous cyclophosphamide followed by azathioprine] did not demonstrate&#xD;
      significant improvement in the primary or secondary end points in the active treatment group&#xD;
      versus the group receiving placebo10. A recent meta-analysis concluded that although previous&#xD;
      trials with cyclophosphamide show a statistically significant improvement in lung function,&#xD;
      they do not show a clinically significant improvement (&gt;10% change in lung function)10.&#xD;
      Considering the risk of infection and other serious adverse effects of oral cyclophosphamide,&#xD;
      the risk benefit ratio may not be favorable for long term use of this drug. The experience&#xD;
      with other immunosuppressive agents like mycophenolate moeftil11, azathioprine (as single&#xD;
      agent)12,rituximab13 are limited to case studies or open label studies and lack double blind&#xD;
      randomized control studies. Nonetheless, the potential adverse effects associated with these&#xD;
      agents raise concern regarding their long term administration in a chronic disease like SSc&#xD;
      -ILD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, the focus of treatment of SSc associated ILD gradually shifting from non- specific&#xD;
      immunosuppressive drugs to specific targeted therapy. Many attempts have been made to use&#xD;
      drugs which target the molecular pathways responsible for causing fibrosis. Imatinib mesylate&#xD;
      is a small molecule that blocks specific tyrosine kinases, including c-Abl and&#xD;
      platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR) kinase. Incubation of cultured fibroblasts&#xD;
      from patients with SSc and healthy volunteers with imatinib strongly inhibited the synthesis&#xD;
      of col 1a1, col 1a2 and fibronectin-1 on the mRNA as well as protein level by up to 90% at&#xD;
      concentrations of 1.0 mg/ml14. Treatment with imatinib completely prevented the development&#xD;
      of fibrosis in the mouse model of Bleomycin-induced dermal fibrosis and tight-skin-1 (tsk-1)&#xD;
      mouse model of SSc15. But clinical trials in patients failed to reproduce this effect. In a&#xD;
      randomized, placebo-controlled trial of patients with mild to moderate Idiopathic pulmonary&#xD;
      fibrosis followed for 96 weeks, imatinib did not affect survival or lung function16. The&#xD;
      major adverse events include edema, muscle cramps and creatine kinase elevations,&#xD;
      uncontrollable diarrhea and bone marrow toxicity, congestive heart failure17. These adverse&#xD;
      effects need particular attention in clinical trials with patients with SSc because these&#xD;
      patients often present with cardiac involvement, diarrhea and coexisting myositis with&#xD;
      creatine kinase elevations. In addition, mild to moderate edema might be less well tolerated&#xD;
      by patients with SSc with existing skin diseases than by patients with cancers 18.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently, endothelin1 (ET-1), is implicated in the pathophysiology of lung fibrosis.&#xD;
      Endothelin 1(ET-1) is known to induce fibroblast chemotaxis and proliferation19, promote&#xD;
      deposition of collagen20, decrease collagenase activity, and increase levels of&#xD;
      fibronectin21. But Bosentan, a nonselective Endothelin receptor antagonist, in randomized&#xD;
      placebo controlled trial failed to have any significant impact on 6-min walk distance or in&#xD;
      lung function parameters 22.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PDE5 enzyme degrades cyclic guanosine monophosphate (c-GMP), a molecule responsible for&#xD;
      nitric oxide-mediated vasodilatation. Recently PDE 5 inhibitors have shown to have novel&#xD;
      antifibrotic effect by increasing level of CGMP. Cyclic GMP in turn activates the&#xD;
      cGMP-dependent protein kinase G (PKG). Phosphorylation of Smad3 at S309 and T368 within MH2&#xD;
      by PKG prevents its heterodimerization with Smad4 and thus disrupts their nuclear&#xD;
      translocation, resulting in repression of transcriptional activation23. TSP1 (thrombospondin&#xD;
      -1) is a molecule catalyzing latent TGF-b activation and is expressed at high levels in&#xD;
      cultured SSc ﬁbroblasts (in vitro) and in activated ﬁbroblasts in lesional skin of SSc (in&#xD;
      vivo). Blockade of TSP1 by cyclic GMP partially abolishes the autocrine TGF-b signaling in&#xD;
      SSc ﬁbroblasts24. Increase in level of cGMP blocks ca2+ pump and thereby improves endothelial&#xD;
      disruption which is the initiating event in pathogenesis of fibrosis. Increase in NO level&#xD;
      also helps in mopping up reactive oxygen species which are implicated in pathogenesis of&#xD;
      fibrosis. In a Bleomycin induced pulmonary fibrosis model, PDE5 inhibition alters pulmonary&#xD;
      and right ventricular (RV) response to intratracheal Bleomycin and that this inhibition acts&#xD;
      through suppression of tissue free radicals and the Rho kinase pathway25. Dunkern et al&#xD;
      showed that predominant PDE activities in lung fibroblasts are attributed to PDE5, PDE1 and&#xD;
      to a smaller extent to PDE4 and PDE inhibitors prevent the formation of myofibroblasts from&#xD;
      fibroblast 26.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The evidence that PDE 5 inhibitors are antifibrotic have mainly came from its effectiveness&#xD;
      in prevention and treatment of Peyronie's disease (PD). In a rat model of TGF-β1-induced PD,&#xD;
      Valente and associates, demonstrated that both oral sildenafil, a PDE5 inhibitor that&#xD;
      protects cGMP from breakdown, and oral pentoxifylline, a predominantly PDE4 inhibitor that&#xD;
      increases cAMP synthesis, counteract the development of the PD-like plaque27. In the case of&#xD;
      pentoxifylline, it was proposed that the well-known cAMP-cGmP signaling crosstalk may be&#xD;
      responsible for its antifibrotic effects. In a subsequent study in the same rat model, it was&#xD;
      shown that another PDe5 inhibitor, vardenafil, given orally and in different dosing regimens,&#xD;
      not only prevented but partially reversed the formation of the PD-like plaque. Preventive&#xD;
      treatment at the higher dose reduced the overall collagen content, collagen iii/i ratio and&#xD;
      the number of myofibroblasts and tGF-β1-positive cells, and selectively increased the&#xD;
      apoptotic index of cells (presumably including myofibroblasts), in the PD-like plaque28. The&#xD;
      antifibrotic effect although initially demonstrated in penile tissue, now proved in other&#xD;
      tissues like heat, kidney and lungs. These antifibrotic effects of PDE5 inhibitors were also&#xD;
      seen in rat models of diabetic nephropathy29, experimental glomerulonephritis24, myocardial&#xD;
      infarction and hypertrophy30, and pulmonary fibrosis. So as scleroderma patients have&#xD;
      fibrosis in multiple organs, the beneficial effect of PDE5 inhibitor may become manifold. It&#xD;
      has also found to be very effective in treating other clinical manifestation of systemic&#xD;
      sclerosis like PAH and digital ulcer. In a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial&#xD;
      of sildenafil in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, there were significant differences in&#xD;
      arterial oxygenation, carbon monoxide diffusion capacity, degree of dyspnea, and quality of&#xD;
      life in patients treated with sildenafil in comparison to placebo group31. Tadalafil is a&#xD;
      PDE5 inhibitor which is longer acting than sildenafil. It is safe and not associated with any&#xD;
      serious life threatening side effect in the recently concluded study of effect of tadalafil&#xD;
      in digital ulcer of scleroderma patients from our center32. In the same trial, Patients&#xD;
      reported improvement of skin tightening and they can move their limb and joint more freely.&#xD;
      Those patients with ILD had improvement or at least stabilization of lung function&#xD;
      (Unpublished). Besides, FMD (flow mediated vasodilation as marker of endothelial dysfunction)&#xD;
      significantly improved in these patients so providing another basis for using this drug for&#xD;
      treatment of pulmonary fibrosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tadalafil, a PDE5 inhibitor, by virtue of its stabilizing effect on endothelial dysfunction&#xD;
      and anti-fibrotic effect, may have efficacy in reducing symptoms due to interstitial lung&#xD;
      disease in scleroderma.&#xD;
