  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Alopecia areata (AA) is a disease of the hair follicles with multifactorial etiology and a&#xD;
      strong component of autoimmune origin. It is characterized by non-scarring hair loss on the&#xD;
      scalp or any hair-bearing surface.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Various therapeutic agents have been described for the treatment of AA, but none are curative&#xD;
      or preventive. The aim of AA treatment is to suppress the activity of the disease.&#xD;
      Phototherapy in the form of topical psoralen and ultraviolet A (PUVA) has been a well&#xD;
      documented therapy for AA since 1978.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A more recent technique of topical PUVA, namely phototoxic PUVA, has been adopted in two&#xD;
      previous studies. Sessions were carried out once every 3 months, and a higher efficacy with&#xD;
      more encouraging response rates in comparison to the conventional PUVA therapy has been&#xD;
      documented. This assumed upper hand over the conventional PUVA might be due to increasing the&#xD;
      amount of UV reaching the hair follicle cells and the surrounding inflammatory cells. Also it&#xD;
      has been suggested that it might play a role as a powerful initiating agent of suppression&#xD;
      through direct action at the DNA level. However, still the exact effect of this treatment has&#xD;
      not been fully clarified.&#xD;
