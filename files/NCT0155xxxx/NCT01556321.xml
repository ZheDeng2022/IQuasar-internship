    <textblock>
      Green tea may have positive effects for weight control and on body composition via several&#xD;
      approaches such as a positive effect on the gut flora, a decrease in fat absorption from the&#xD;
      intestines and an increase in resting energy expenditure. We would like to investigate the&#xD;
      long-term effects of green tea on gut flora, fat absorption, resting energy expenditure and&#xD;
      body composition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be conducted in a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind parallel design&#xD;
      with four groups consisting of control groups and green tea groups with normal weight&#xD;
      subjects and obese subjects. At three time points (baseline, 6 weeks and 12 weeks) faeces are&#xD;
      collected for analyzing the gut flora composition and fat content. Furthermore, measurements&#xD;
      of resting energy expenditure and body composition will be conducted. Activity will be&#xD;
      measured during three weeks (baseline, week 6 and week 12).&#xD;
&#xD;
      a hundred healthy subjects (50 males and 50 females) with a BMI between 18.5-25 kg/m2 and ≥30&#xD;
      kg/m2 and aged between 18-50 years will be included in the study. All subjects will be&#xD;
      non-smoking, non tea-drinkers, weight stable, dietary unrestraint, and at most moderate&#xD;
      alcohol and caffeine consumers. Subjects will be free of medication except for oral&#xD;
      contraceptives use in women.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention (if applicable):&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will receive either green tea or placebo in capsule form after their baseline&#xD;
      measurement, which they have to consume three times daily for a period of twelve weeks.&#xD;
