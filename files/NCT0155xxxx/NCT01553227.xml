    <textblock>
      Sleep Apnea Hypopnea Syndrome (OSAHS), is common in patients with OHS, compared to single&#xD;
      Obesity Hypoventilation Syndrome (OHS) or OSAHS ,patients with both of them are more&#xD;
      susceptible to have serious hypoxia and carbon dioxide retention during sleep, and much more&#xD;
      likely to result in pulmonary hypertension and cor-pulmonale.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At present, the most widely and valid method for these patients is the Bilevel Positive&#xD;
      Airway Pressure (BiPAP) ventilation, while, recently, the investigators discovered a&#xD;
      completely novel device, namely auto-trilevel Ventilator. In contrast to the traditional&#xD;
      therapy, auto-trilevel Ventilator has a more flexible expiratory positive airway pressure&#xD;
      (EPAP), with which it can removing residual obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea events and&#xD;
      correcting hypercapnia without contradiction. Treated with auto-trilevel ventilator may delay&#xD;
      the progression of disease and improve life quality. The overall purpose of this study is to&#xD;
      determine the curative effects of auto-trilevel ventilators on patients with OHS and OSAHS.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The main contradiction in treatment for OSAHS complicated OHS is how to improve hypercapnia&#xD;
      because of narrower difference between inspiratory positive airway pressure (IPAP) and&#xD;
      expiratory positive airway pressure (EPAP), and meanwhile to eliminate apnea and popnea&#xD;
      events which may easily occur at the end of expiration For ordinary Bipap ventilator. If the&#xD;
      IPAP is set to higher, the patients may feel discomfort, if the pressure difference between&#xD;
      IPAP and EPAP is too narrow or the expiratory positive airway pressure (EPAP) too high,&#xD;
      hypercapnia may occur. If the EPAP is too low, redusual apnea and hypopnea event may become&#xD;
      common.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Auto-trilevel ventilation, with a lower airway pressure at the beginning of expiration to&#xD;
      prevent hypercapnia and a higher airway pressure at the end of expiration to prevent residual&#xD;
      apnea events, should be able to provide a novel ventilation mode with a higher efficacy and&#xD;
      lower average airway pressure for OSAHS patients complicated with OHS. To prove the&#xD;
      hypothesis, comparison is made between ordinary BiPAP and auto-Trilevel ventilation modes&#xD;
      during treatment for patients with OSAHS and OHS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, the investigators compare the changes of related indexes (including apnea&#xD;
      hypopnea index、minimal pulse oxygen saturation、arousal index, sleep quality,PaCO2 and&#xD;
      sleepiness scores) before and after treatment. Meanwhile, curative effects will be compared&#xD;
      between BiPAP and auto-Trilevel ventilation modes. The investigators will analyze the changes&#xD;
      and then confirm our hypothesis.&#xD;
