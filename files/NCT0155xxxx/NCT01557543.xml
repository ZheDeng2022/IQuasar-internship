  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Bone marrow stromal stem cells (also known as mesenchymal stem cells) have been isolated&#xD;
      and are found to make large amounts of growth factors. Because they make growth factors,&#xD;
      these cells can help re-grow tissue and encourage repair of damaged tissue. Tests on damaged&#xD;
      heart muscle suggest that injecting these cells directly into damaged heart muscle can&#xD;
      improve heart function. Researchers want to give stem cells to people who are having open&#xD;
      heart surgery to see if they can help to repair heart muscle damage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To test the safety and effectiveness of bone marrow stromal stem cell injections given&#xD;
      during heart surgery to treat heart muscle damage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Individuals at least 18 years of age who are scheduled to have open heart surgery for heart&#xD;
      artery or vein blockages.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be screened with a physical exam and medical history. Blood and urine&#xD;
           samples will also be collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will have bone marrow taken from both hip bones about 3 weeks before the&#xD;
           heart surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  During the surgery, the stromal stem cells collected from the bone marrow will be given&#xD;
           into the damaged portion of the heart muscle. The rest of the heart surgery will be&#xD;
           performed according to standard procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  After the surgery, participants will be monitored for complications from the stromal&#xD;
           stem cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will have heart function tests to see if the stromal stem cell treatments&#xD;
           were effective....&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Many investigators now believe that bone marrow-derived stem cells or endothelial progenitor&#xD;
      cells can be recruited to and incorporated into tissues undergoing neovascularization,&#xD;
      including cardiac tissue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stem cells which include hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), endothelial progenitor cells&#xD;
      (EPCs), mesenchymal stem cells / stromal stem cells (MSCs), myoblasts, and undifferentiated&#xD;
      side population cells have been used as an alternative therapeutic strategy for ischemic&#xD;
      cardiovascular diseases that cannot be treated by routine interventional approaches.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a porcine pre-clinical study we found that cells survived after intramyocardial injection&#xD;
      and differentiated into vascular cells, smooth muscle or endothelial cells. Functional&#xD;
      analysis of regional wall motion and ejection fraction demonstrated statistically significant&#xD;
      improvement in function in cell treated animals after six weeks compared with baseline and&#xD;
      sham controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A variety of studies have been conducted in subjects with coronary artery disease using&#xD;
      different cell types and routes of administration. This study will be the first of its kind&#xD;
      to administer autologous BMSC via direct intramyocardial injection in a rigorous clinical&#xD;
      trial in the U.S.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To evaluate the safety and feasibility of direct intra-myocardial injection of autologous&#xD;
      bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs) in adult subjects undergoing coronary artery bypass graft&#xD;
      (CABG) or transmyocardial revascularization (TMR).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A secondary objective is to assess whether direct intra-myocardial injection of autologous&#xD;
      bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs) improves the patient s cardiac function, quality of life,&#xD;
      and reduces cardiac events compared with historical controls at three and six months after&#xD;
      intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adult subjects with three-vessel coronary artery disease who plan to undergo CABG or TMR at&#xD;
      the NIH Heart Center at Suburban Hospital and are willing to participate, who have stable&#xD;
      angina, LV EF less than or equal to 50%, and who have evidence of hypokinetic segments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be excluded if they have had a recent myocardial infarction (MI), bleeding&#xD;
      disorder, infection, HIV or who are unable to wait 3 weeks for surgery while cells are being&#xD;
      expanded prior to injection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bone marrow aspiration will be performed on subjects who suffer from ischemic heart disease&#xD;
      with depressed left ventricular function three weeks before their admission to have CABG or&#xD;
      TMR in the NIH Clinical Center Outpatient Clinic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will be presented based on the subject s treatment regimen:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 1 CABG+Cells (total of 10 evaluable subjects)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 2 TMR + Cells (total of 10 evaluable subjects)&#xD;
&#xD;
      The autologous MSCs will be isolated from the marrow aspirate, cultured and expanded in vitro&#xD;
      for 3 passages (approximately 21 days (+/- 4 days)) in the Clinical Center Cell Processing&#xD;
      Laboratory (CPS), located in the Department of Transfusion Medicine (DTM), Clinical Center,&#xD;
      NIH.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the surgery at Suburban Hospital, the MSCs will be injected directly into the ischemic&#xD;
      area after CABG or TMR. Patients will be assessed for functional improvements pre, 3, 6, 12&#xD;
      and 60 months after the surgery by transthoracic echocardiography and/or by MRI at pre, 3 and&#xD;
      6 months after surgery. Toxicity data will be reported from time of surgery to 6 months after&#xD;
      surgery, unless later toxicities occur that are related to cell injection.&#xD;

&#xD;
               4. Two-vessel disease with significant proximal LAD stenosis and either EF &lt;0.50 or&#xD;
                  demonstrable ischemia on noninvasive&#xD;

&#xD;
               5. One- or 2-vessel coronary artery disease without significant proximal LAD&#xD;
                  stenosis, but with a large area of viable&#xD;
&#xD;
        myocardium and high-risk criteria on noninvasive testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
        - Indications for TMR (32, 33).&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Canadian Cardiovascular Class III or IV angina that is refractory to maximal medical&#xD;
             therapy.&#xD;

             corresponding to the regions of myocardial&#xD;
&#xD;
             ischemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. In all regions of the myocardium, the coronary disease must not be amenable to&#xD;
             coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) or&#xD;
&#xD;
        percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA), due to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        i. severe diffuse disease,&#xD;
&#xD;
        ii. lack of suitable targets for complete revascularization,&#xD;
&#xD;
        iii. lack of suitable conduits for complete revascularization&#xD;

        - Stable Angina. Patient?s clinical state has to be stable to receive surgical treatment.&#xD;
        Patients must have received or currently receiving standard of care medical therapy(33) for&#xD;
        at least 4 weeks prior to enrollment, to include:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Aspirin in the absence of contraindications in patients with prior MI&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Beta-blockers as initial therapy in the absence of contraindications in patients with&#xD;

&#xD;
             than 100 mg/dL&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. ACE inhibitor in patients with CAD (considered significant by angiography or previous&#xD;
             MI) who also have diabetes and/or left&#xD;
&#xD;
        ventricular systolic dysfunction.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Three-vessel CAD. Multi-vessel diffuse coronary artery disease not amenable to&#xD;
             percutaneous coronary intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  LV EF less than or equal to 50% by by MRI or Echocardiogram. The left ventricle&#xD;
             ejection fraction less than 50% evidenced the diagnosis of heart failure indicating&#xD;
             global weakness of myocardial contractility and leaves space for functional&#xD;
             improvement.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Evidence of hypokinetic segment. Regional wall motion abnormality which includes&#xD;
             regional low/no motion, or motion in opposite direction, is a good indication for&#xD;
             invasive intervention and can be well-compared before and after treatment.&#xD;

&#xD;
        iv. Total Bilirubin less than or equal to 2mg/dL&#xD;
&#xD;
        v. AST (SGOT)/ALT (SGPT) less than or equal 1.5 times&#xD;

        institutional upper limit of normal (ULN)&#xD;
&#xD;
        vi. Creatinine less than or equal to institutional upper limit of&#xD;
&#xD;
        normal (ULN)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Must be willing to participate in 10-CC-0053 to obtain autologous bone marrow.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must understand and sign an informed consent document that explains the&#xD;
             nature of his/her cardiac disease, the procedures to be followed, the experimental&#xD;
             nature of the treatment, alternative treatments, and potential risks and toxicities.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have the following conditions will be excluded from the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Acute MI. Less than three months after recent acute myocardial infarction.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Unstable angina. Excluded due to the propensity to deteriorate into AMI.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Bleeding disorder, including history of familial hemophilia, signs and symptoms of&#xD;
             easy bruising, petechiae, or platelet count &lt; 80,000 cells/mcL. This disorder may&#xD;
             unnecessarily complicate the operative procedure and postoperative recovery.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Severe respiratory disorder, including acute asthma, chronic bronchitis, severe&#xD;
             chronic obstructive lung disease. A disorder that would complicate the operative&#xD;
             procedure and postoperative recovery.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Unable to provide informed consent on this study or on 10-CC-0053.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Unable to wait 3 weeks for surgery, which is the waiting period for ex-vivo cell&#xD;
             expansion.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Reactive for anti-HIV, Hepatitis B surface antigen, anti-HCV or nucleic acid testing&#xD;
             for HIV, Hepatitis B and C. An investigational component accompanying this major&#xD;
             surgical procedure in the presence of infection has the potential to increase risk of&#xD;
             complications, and manufacturing contaminated products risks contaminating other&#xD;
             cellular products in CPS.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant or lactating females, due to the highly investigational nature of this study&#xD;
             and its unknown effects on a developing fetus.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Allergic to Gentamicin.&#xD;
