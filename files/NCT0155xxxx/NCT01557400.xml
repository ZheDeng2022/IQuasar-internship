  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Duchenne/Becker muscular dystrophy (DBMD) is a genetic disorder that develops in boys. It is&#xD;
      caused by a mutation in the gene for dystrophin, a protein that is important for maintaining&#xD;
      normal muscle structure and function. Loss of dystrophin causes muscle fragility that leads&#xD;
      to weakness and loss of walking ability during childhood and teenage years. A specific type&#xD;
      of mutation, called a nonsense (premature stop codon) mutation, is the cause of DBMD in&#xD;
      approximately 10-15% of boys with the disease. Ataluren is an orally delivered,&#xD;
      investigational drug that has the potential to overcome the effects of the nonsense mutation.&#xD;
      This study comprises a Phase 3, open-label study of ataluren in participants with nmDBMD who&#xD;
      previously received ataluren at an Investigator site in a prior PTC-sponsored clinical study.&#xD;
      A separate open-label study (PTC124-GD-016-DMD; NCT01247207) is being conducted for nmDBMD&#xD;
      participants who previously received ataluren at an Investigator site in the United States&#xD;
      (US).&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All participating sites must have had at least 1 participant that received ataluren treatment&#xD;
      in prior PTC-sponsored clinical studies in DBMD (Phase 2b double-blind, placebo-controlled&#xD;
      study [PTC124-GD-007-DMD; NCT00592553] and the subsequent open-label extension study [Study&#xD;
      PTC124-GD-007e-DMD; NCT00847379]). It is planned that up to ~96 participants will be&#xD;
      enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is also planned that participants will receive ataluren 3 times per day (TID) at&#xD;
      respective morning, midday, and evening doses of 10 milligrams/kilograms (mg/kg), 10 mg/kg,&#xD;
      and 20 mg/kg for approximately 336 weeks. Study assessments will be performed at clinic&#xD;
      visits during screening, on the first day of ataluren dosing, and then every 48 weeks during&#xD;
      the ataluren treatment period, except for weight, which will be measured every 24 weeks at a&#xD;
      primary care physician (PCP).&#xD;

    <description>A TEAE is any untoward medical occurrence or undesirable event(s) experienced in a participant that begins or worsens following administration of the study drug or study treatment, whether or not considered related to the treatment by the Investigator. A serious adverse event (SAE) was an adverse event (AE) resulting in any of the following outcomes or deemed significant for any other reason, death, initial or prolonged inpatient hospitalization, life-threatening experience (immediate risk of dying), or persistent or significant disability/incapacity not related to nmDBMD. AEs included both SAEs and non-serious AEs. AEs were classified according to National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 3.0 (CTCAE) and coded using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA). A summary of serious and all other non-serious adverse events, regardless of causality, is located in the Reported Adverse Events module.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline, Weeks 48, 96, 144, 192, and 240</time_frame>
    <description>The 6MWD was assessed in participants who were ambulatory using standardized procedures. Participants were not permitted to use assistive devices (walker, long leg braces, or short leg braces) during the 6MWD test.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Physical Function as Measured by the NSAA</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Weeks 48, 96, 144, 192, and 240</time_frame>
    <description>The NSAA was used to evaluate physical function in participants who were ambulatory at study entry, using standardized procedures. The NSAA consisted of 17 activities, each scored as 0 (activity could not be performed), 1 (modified method but achieved goal without physical assistance from another), or 2 (normal, achieved goal without assistance). The sum of these 17 scores was used to form a total score. If fewer than 13 of the 17 activities were performed, the total score was considered missing. If 13 to 16 activities were performed, the total score was calculated by multiplying the sum of the scores in the x activities that were performed by 17/x. If an activity could not be performed due to disease progression/loss of ambulation, a score of 0 was assigned. The linear score was the linear transformation of the NSAA score to a scale of 0 (worst) to 100 (best).</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Time to Stand From Supine Position</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Weeks 48, 96, 144, 192, and 240</time_frame>
    <description>Time to stand from the supine position to a standing position was assessed in ambulatory participants. If the time taken to perform a test exceeded 30 seconds or if a participant could not perform the test due to disease progression, a value of 30 seconds was used.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Time to Walk/Run 10 Meters</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Weeks 48, 96, 144, 192, and 240</time_frame>
    <description>Time to walk/run 10 meters was measured in ambulatory participants. If the time taken to perform a test exceeded 30 seconds or if a participant could not perform the test due to disease progression, a value of 30 seconds was used.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Pulmonary Function as Measured by Spirometry</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Weeks 48, 96, 144, 192, and 240</time_frame>
    <description>Pulmonary function parameters of %-predicated FVC, percent-predicted FEV1 (adjusted using ulna length and age), PEF, and PCF was assessed in non-ambulatory participants by using a spirometer. Due to the difficulty in obtaining an accurate standing height measurement in non-ambulatory participants, ulna length and arm span were used as a surrogate measure for height when calculating percent-predicted FVC.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Participant and Parent/Caregiver-Reported ADL, as Measured by the EK Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Weeks 48, 96, 144, 192, and 240</time_frame>
    <description>Activities of daily living after loss of ambulation were measured using the EK scale. The EK scale is an ordinal scale ranging from 0 to 30 points where 0 represents the highest level of independent function and 30 the lowest. The scale consists of 10 categories (each scored 0 to 3), involving different functional domains including 1) ability to use wheelchair, 2) ability to transfer from wheelchair, 3) ability to stand, 4) ability to balance in the wheelchair, 5) ability to move arms, 6) ability to use hands and arms when eating, 7) ability to turn in bed, 8) ability to cough, 9) ability to speak, and 10) physical well-being. The administration of the EK scale consisted of an interview of the participant to capture how he performs the tasks of daily life (as described by Categories 1 to 9) and how he perceives his wellbeing (as described by Category 10). The interviewer observed the participant and assigned the final score for the tasks that could be observed in the clinic.</description>

      <recruitment_details>The treatment gap between the date of administration of the last dose of ataluren in Study PTC124-GD-007-DMD (NCT00592553) and Study PTC124-GD-007e-DMD (NCT00847379) and the date of administration of the first dose of ataluren in this study (PTC124-GD-019-DMD) ranged from 114.43 to 266.14 weeks (801 to 1863 days).</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>Of the 94 enrolled participants, 44 were not ambulatory and 84 were on concomitant therapy with corticosteroids. Participants who were non-ambulatory were not able to run/walk 10 meters in ≤30 seconds at study entry.</pre_assignment_details>

          <title>Ataluren</title>
          <description>Ataluren was provided as a vanilla-flavored powder to be mixed with water, milk, fruit juice (except apple juice) fruit punch, or in semi-solid food (for example, yogurt, pudding, or applesauce). The dose level for ataluren was 10 milligrams/kilograms (mg/kg) in the morning, 10 mg/kg at midday, and 20 mg/kg in the evening. Administration within 30 minutes after a meal was recommended. Study drug dosing was based on milligrams of drug per kilogram of body weight. Because of potential changes in participant body weight over time, weight-based dose adjustment occurred every 24 weeks as required. Study drug was taken for up to 240 weeks.</description>

Sum of 17 scores = total score. If fewer than 13 activities were performed, total score was considered missing. If 13-16 activities were performed, total score = sum of scores in x activities that were performed by 17/x. If an activity couldn't be performed due to disease progression/loss of ambulation, a score of 0 was assigned. Linear score was linear transformation of NSAA score to a scale of 0 (worst) to 100 (best).</description>

          <title>Pulmonary Function as Measured by Spirometry</title>
          <description>Pulmonary function parameters of %-predicated forced vital capacity (FVC), percent-predicted forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1), peak expiratory flow (PEF), and peak cough flow (PCF) was assessed in non-ambulatory participants by using a spirometer. Due to the difficulty in obtaining an accurate standing height measurement in non-ambulatory participants, ulna length and arm span were used as a surrogate measure for height when calculating percent-predicted FVC.</description>

        <description>A TEAE is any untoward medical occurrence or undesirable event(s) experienced in a participant that begins or worsens following administration of the study drug or study treatment, whether or not considered related to the treatment by the Investigator. A serious adverse event (SAE) was an adverse event (AE) resulting in any of the following outcomes or deemed significant for any other reason, death, initial or prolonged inpatient hospitalization, life-threatening experience (immediate risk of dying), or persistent or significant disability/incapacity not related to nmDBMD. AEs included both SAEs and non-serious AEs. AEs were classified according to National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 3.0 (CTCAE) and coded using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA). A summary of serious and all other non-serious adverse events, regardless of causality, is located in the Reported Adverse Events module.</description>

Study drug dosing was based on milligrams of drug per kilogram of body weight. Because of potential changes in participant body weight over time, weight-based dose adjustment occurred every 24 weeks as required. Study drug was taken for up to 240 weeks.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Physical Function as Measured by the NSAA</title>
        <description>The NSAA was used to evaluate physical function in participants who were ambulatory at study entry, using standardized procedures. The NSAA consisted of 17 activities, each scored as 0 (activity could not be performed), 1 (modified method but achieved goal without physical assistance from another), or 2 (normal, achieved goal without assistance). The sum of these 17 scores was used to form a total score. If fewer than 13 of the 17 activities were performed, the total score was considered missing. If 13 to 16 activities were performed, the total score was calculated by multiplying the sum of the scores in the x activities that were performed by 17/x. If an activity could not be performed due to disease progression/loss of ambulation, a score of 0 was assigned. The linear score was the linear transformation of the NSAA score to a scale of 0 (worst) to 100 (best).</description>

        <population>All enrolled participants who received at least 1 dose of study drug, were ambulatory, and had evaluable NSAA data. Participants who were ambulatory were able to run/walk 10 meters in ≤30 seconds at study entry.</population>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Pulmonary Function as Measured by Spirometry</title>
        <description>Pulmonary function parameters of %-predicated FVC, percent-predicted FEV1 (adjusted using ulna length and age), PEF, and PCF was assessed in non-ambulatory participants by using a spirometer. Due to the difficulty in obtaining an accurate standing height measurement in non-ambulatory participants, ulna length and arm span were used as a surrogate measure for height when calculating percent-predicted FVC.</description>
        <time_frame>Baseline, Weeks 48, 96, 144, 192, and 240</time_frame>
        <population>All enrolled participants who received at least 1 dose of study drug, were non-ambulatory, and had evaluable spirometry data. Participants who were non-ambulatory were not able to run/walk 10 meters in ≤30 seconds at study entry.</population>

            <title>Ataluren</title>
            <description>Ataluren was provided as a vanilla-flavored powder to be mixed with water, milk, fruit juice (except apple juice) fruit punch, or in semi-solid food (for example, yogurt, pudding, or applesauce). The dose level for ataluren was 10 mg/kg in the morning, 10 mg/kg at midday, and 20 mg/kg in the evening. Administration within 30 minutes after a meal was recommended. Study drug dosing was based on milligrams of drug per kilogram of body weight. Because of potential changes in participant body weight over time, weight-based dose adjustment occurred every 24 weeks as required. Study drug was taken for up to 240 weeks.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Participant and Parent/Caregiver-Reported ADL, as Measured by the EK Scale</title>
        <description>Activities of daily living after loss of ambulation were measured using the EK scale. The EK scale is an ordinal scale ranging from 0 to 30 points where 0 represents the highest level of independent function and 30 the lowest. The scale consists of 10 categories (each scored 0 to 3), involving different functional domains including 1) ability to use wheelchair, 2) ability to transfer from wheelchair, 3) ability to stand, 4) ability to balance in the wheelchair, 5) ability to move arms, 6) ability to use hands and arms when eating, 7) ability to turn in bed, 8) ability to cough, 9) ability to speak, and 10) physical well-being. The administration of the EK scale consisted of an interview of the participant to capture how he performs the tasks of daily life (as described by Categories 1 to 9) and how he perceives his wellbeing (as described by Category 10). The interviewer observed the participant and assigned the final score for the tasks that could be observed in the clinic.</description>
        <time_frame>Baseline, Weeks 48, 96, 144, 192, and 240</time_frame>
        <population>All enrolled participants who received at least 1 dose of study drug, were non-ambulatory, and had evaluable EK scale data. Participants who were non-ambulatory were not able to run/walk 10 meters in ≤30 seconds at study entry.</population>

            <description>Ataluren was provided as a vanilla-flavored powder to be mixed with water, milk, fruit juice (except apple juice) fruit punch, or in semi-solid food (for example, yogurt, pudding, or applesauce). The dose level for ataluren was 10 mg/kg in the morning, 10 mg/kg at midday, and 20 mg/kg in the evening. Administration within 30 minutes after a meal was recommended. Study drug dosing was based on milligrams of drug per kilogram of body weight. Because of potential changes in participant body weight over time, weight-based dose adjustment occurred every 24 weeks as required. Study drug was taken for up to 240 weeks.</description>
