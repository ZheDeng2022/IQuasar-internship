  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This Phase 3, double-blind (controlled assessment period), randomized, multicenter,&#xD;
      placebo-controlled parallel study is designed to examine the efficacy and safety of EQW&#xD;
      compared to placebo (PBO) in adolescents with type 2 diabetes for 24 weeks. This study will&#xD;
      assess safety and efficacy of EQW (as monotherapy and adjunctive therapy to oral antidiabetic&#xD;
      agents and/or insulin). At least 40% and not more than 60% of the randomized patients must be&#xD;
      females. At least 40% of patients should be recruited from areas with similar ethnicity and&#xD;
      lifestyle to those of the European Union member states. Long term safety and efficacy of EQW&#xD;
      will subsequently be monitored for 28 weeks in the open-label, uncontrolled extension period&#xD;
      (through Week 52). The study will be terminated at Visit 11 (Week 62/Study Termination) which&#xD;
      will be a follow-up visit occurring 10 weeks after the last dose administration at Visit 10&#xD;
      (Week 52). This study will be conducted in 77 patients with type 2 diabetes treated with diet&#xD;
      and exercise alone or in combination with a stable dose of oral antidiabetic agents and/or&#xD;
      insulin for at least 2 months prior to screening. During the controlled assessment period,&#xD;
      approximately 77 patients will be randomly assigned in a 5:2 ratio to either EQW 2 mg (Group&#xD;
      A) or PBO (Group B), to yield at least 70 evaluable patients: at least 50 patients in the&#xD;
      exenatide and at least 20 patients in the PBO group. Following the 24-week controlled&#xD;
      assessment period, patients assigned to the EQW 2 mg treatment (Group A) will continue to be&#xD;
      treated with EQW 2 mg during the extension period (through Week 52). Patients randomized to&#xD;
      PBO (Group B) will receive EQW 2 mg beginning at the start of the extension period, Week 25&#xD;
      through Week 52. In addition to receiving study medications, all patients will participate in&#xD;
      a lifestyle intervention program encompassing diet and physical activity modifications&#xD;
      following the signing of the informed consent and assent forms (Visit 1 [Week -2]) through&#xD;
      the end of the extension period (Week 52). Following Visit 11 (Week 62/Study Termination),&#xD;
      patients whose height increase is at least 5 mm between Visit 8 (Week 28) and Visit 11 (Week&#xD;
      62/Study Termination) will participate in a long-term safety follow-up period. Patients who&#xD;
      discontinue study medication prior to Visit 11 (Week 62/Study Termination) will also&#xD;
      participate in the Extended Safety Follow-up Period, unless they have a height increase of&#xD;
      less than 5 mm over a 6-month interval at study site visits prior to discontinuation of study&#xD;
      medication. Patients who do not have height assessments at study-site visits over a 6-month&#xD;
      interval prior to discontinuation of study medication will enter the Extended Safety&#xD;
      Follow-up Period. The Extended Safety Follow Up Period will continue for up to 3 years or&#xD;
      until the difference between two 6-month interval visits is less than a 5 mm increase&#xD;
      (whichever comes first). No study medication will be administered during the Extended Safety&#xD;
      Follow-up Period. Blood samples will be collected for calcitonin and carcinoembryonic antigen&#xD;
      (CEA) laboratory measurements.&#xD;

A patient was said to have treatment-emergent ADA positive at a visit if the antibody test was positive after the first dose of exenatide following a negative or missing antibody measurement, or the titer increased by at least 1 titration category from a detectable measurement prior to first dose of randomized study medication.</description>

    <participant_flow>
      <recruitment_details>This study was conducted in adolescents (aged 10 to 17 years inclusive) with type 2 diabetes treated with diet and exercise alone or in combination with a stable dose of oral antidiabetic agents and/or insulin for at least 2 months prior to screening. 27 study centers in 6 countries randomized patients during the study.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>Study had a screening period (5 weeks), controlled assessment period (24 weeks; patients randomized 5:2 to exenatide or placebo), open-label extension period (28 weeks) and post-treatment follow-up period (10 weeks). 84 patients were randomized but 1 due to clinical error and immediately discontinued, thus, 83 patients were included in the study.</pre_assignment_details>

          <description>Percentage of patients reporting injection site reactions at Week 24 and at each intermediate visit during the controlled assessment period is reported. Injection site reactions were presented from the AE case report form (CRF), based on the &quot;Injection site reactions&quot; higher level term. A controlled assessment period AE was defined as an AE starting on or after day of first dose of study medication up to but not including Week 24 for patients entering the extension period. For patients not entering the extension period, the period was defined up to and including last dose of study medication + 7 days (+ 90 days for SAEs and other clinically significant or related AEs).</description>
          <population>The Safety Analysis Set consisted of all patients who received at least 1 dose of study medication. Only patients with data available at each specified visit were included in the analysis.</population>

          <description>Number of patients needing rescue medication at Week 52 and at each intermediate visit during the treatment period is reported. The treatment period was defined as the controlled assessment period and extension period combined. Patients with a loss of glycemic control, defined as either an increase from baseline in HbA1c values by â‰¥ 1.0% at 2 consecutive clinic visits that were at least 1 month apart, or a fasting plasma glucose value â‰¥ 250 mg/dL or random blood glucose value &gt; 300 mg/dL for 4 days during a 7 day period, received rescue medication. Data collected after premature discontinuation of study medication were excluded.</description>

Data collected after initiation of rescue medication were included. Data collected after discontinuation of study medication were excluded.</description>
