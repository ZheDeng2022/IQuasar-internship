      Uncomplicated laparoscopic cholecystectomy will in most patients result in moderate to severe&#xD;
      pain until the first postoperative day. This will subside during the second and third&#xD;
      postoperative day [1]. A feeling of low general well-being will also be present until the&#xD;
      first postoperative day and subside during the next couple of days [2].&#xD;
&#xD;
      To achieve faster recovery after laparoscopic interventions it has been shown that a&#xD;
      reduction in the size of laparoscopic ports and thereby incisions can reduce postoperative&#xD;
      pain [3,4].&#xD;
&#xD;
      A new minimal invasive surgical technique is based on the principle of completely eliminating&#xD;
      the use of ports through the abdominal wall. This new technique is called Natural Orifice&#xD;
      Transluminal Endoscopic Surgery (NOTES) and is defined by acquiring minimal invasive access&#xD;
      to the abdominal cavity through the body's natural openings like the mouth and stomach, anus,&#xD;
      urethra and vagina. With the NOTES technique one can completely avoid incisions in the&#xD;
      abdominal wall and thereby reduce the surgical trauma. The benefits of this technique is a&#xD;
      reduction of postoperative pain, elimination of incisional hernias, prevention of wound&#xD;
      infections, reduction of peritoneal adherence formation, achieving a faster recovery and a&#xD;
      better cosmetic result [7,8].&#xD;
&#xD;
      The most documented and well-described way for gaining NOTES access to the abdominal cavity&#xD;
      is through the vagina, transvaginal (TV). TV NOTES has mainly been used for cholecystectomy&#xD;
      because of the direct line of vision to the upper abdomen and gallbladder that is achieved&#xD;
      through this opening.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Compilation of results show that TV NOTES cholecystectomy can be implemented with low&#xD;
      complication rates [20-22]. One retrospective case-control and one prospective observational&#xD;
      study report less postoperative pain, reduced consumption of analgesics and faster recovery&#xD;
      for TV NOTES compared to conventional laparoscopic cholecystectomy [23,24]. To date there are&#xD;
      no systematic prospective randomized data on whether or not TV NOTES cholecystectomy leads to&#xD;
      a better surgical outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the present study the postoperative course after TV NOTES cholecystectomy will be compared&#xD;
      to laparoscopic cholecystectomy in a prospective randomized and blinded trial. The outcome of&#xD;
      the randomization between the two surgical techniques will be blinded to patient and the&#xD;
      nurse staff for the first 72 hours after the operation. The primary outcome parameter will be&#xD;
      postoperative pain score during the first 24 hours. Secondary outcome parameters are&#xD;
      postoperative pain score for the first 72 hours, fatigue, well-being, nausea, consumption of&#xD;
      analgesics, complications, cosmetic result and sexual function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis being that TV NOTES cholecystectomy gives less postoperative pain, fatigue and&#xD;
      nausea, a reduction in analgesics and a better cosmetic result and general well-being than&#xD;
      conventional 4 port laparoscopic cholecystectomy.&#xD;

      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Uncomplicated laparoscopic cholecystectomy will in most patients result in moderate to severe&#xD;
      pain up until the first postoperative day. This will subside during the second and third&#xD;
      postoperative day [1]. A feeling of low general well-being will also be present up until the&#xD;
      first postoperative day and subside during the next couple of days [2].&#xD;
&#xD;
      To achieve faster recovery after laparoscopic interventions it has been shown that a&#xD;
      reduction in the size of laparoscopic ports and thereby incisions can reduce postoperative&#xD;
      pain [3,4]. Whether a further reduction of postoperative pain can be achieved by limiting the&#xD;
      number of laparoscopic ports through the abdominal wall to a single one with Single Incision&#xD;
      Laparoscopic Surgery (SILS) remains to be determined [5,6].&#xD;
&#xD;
      A new minimal invasive surgical technique is based on the principle of completely eliminating&#xD;
      the use of ports through the abdominal wall. This new technique is called Natural Orifice&#xD;
      Transluminal Endoscopic Surgery (NOTES) and is defined by acquiring minimal invasive access&#xD;
      to the abdominal cavity through the body's natural openings like the mouth and stomach, anus,&#xD;
      urethra and vagina. With the NOTES technique one can completely avoid incisions in the&#xD;
      abdominal wall and thereby further reduce the surgical trauma. The benefits of this technique&#xD;
      is a reduction of postoperative pain, elimination of incisional hernias, prevention of wound&#xD;
      infections, reduction of peritoneal adherence formation, achieving a faster recovery and a&#xD;
      better cosmetic result [7,8].&#xD;
&#xD;
      The most documented and well-described way for gaining NOTES access to the abdominal cavity&#xD;
      is through the vagina, transvaginal (TV). There are several reasons for this. First of all&#xD;
      the technique for gaining TV access to the abdominal cavity is already being used in&#xD;
      gynaecology, where culdoscopy was first described in the literature nearly 100 years ago [9].&#xD;
      A diagnostic procedure for infertility that can be used in an outpatient setting [10-12].&#xD;
      Similarly, transvaginal ports have been used in gynaecology as a substitute for abdominal&#xD;
      ports [13,14]. Thus there is already a well proven and established technique for obtaining&#xD;
      transvaginal access to the abdominal cavity. Secondly it is easy to ensure a secure surgical&#xD;
      closure of the point of entry under direct visualization with basic suturing instruments. And&#xD;
      lastly the risk of contamination and infection is minimal when performing TV procedures [15].&#xD;
&#xD;
      TV NOTES has mainly been used for cholecystectomy because of the direct line of vision to the&#xD;
      upper abdomen including the liver and gallbladder that is achieved through this body opening.&#xD;
      For the same reason it is possible to use the same surgical dissection technique and rigid&#xD;
      instruments that is used when performing conventional laparoscopic or SILS cholecystectomies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Questionnaire surveys have shown that there is a general interest for TV NOTES in the public,&#xD;
      where between 33-68 % of women surveyed preferred TV NOTES to conventional laparoscopy&#xD;
      [16-18].&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a German national database called German NOTES Registry (GNR) more than 900 transvaginal&#xD;
      procedures have been registered. Compilation of results from the GNR and other human series&#xD;
      and multicenter trials have shown that TV NOTES cholecystectomy can be implemented with low&#xD;
      complication rates [19-21]. One retrospective case-control and one prospective observational&#xD;
      study report less postoperative pain, reduced consumption of analgesics and faster recovery&#xD;
      for TV NOTES cholecystectomy compared to conventional laparoscopic cholecystectomy [22,23].&#xD;
      To date there are no systematic prospective randomized data on whether or not TV NOTES&#xD;
      cholecystectomy leads to a better surgical outcome in regards to pain, well-being etc. than&#xD;
      conventional laparoscopic cholecystectomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY AIM:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the study is in a prospective randomized blinded design to compare the&#xD;
      postoperative course and outcome of TV NOTES and conventional laparoscopic cholecystectomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HYPOTHESIS:&#xD;
&#xD;
      TV NOTES cholecystectomy gives less postoperative pain, fatigue and nausea, reduces analgesic&#xD;
      consumption and gives a better cosmetic result and well-being than conventional 4 port&#xD;
      laparoscopic cholecystectomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TRIAL PARTICIPANTS:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Trial participants will be recruited among women between 40-75 years referred to laparoscopic&#xD;
      cholecystectomy due to symptomatic gallstones or gallstone induced mild pancreatitis and&#xD;
      ultrasonography confirmed gallstones.&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHOD:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistics:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome measure &quot;cumulated pain score during mobilisation for the first 72&#xD;
      postoperative hours&quot; has been used for power calculation. In a previous study the mean for&#xD;
      this parameter measured on the visual analogue scale (VAS) for laparoscopic cholecystectomy&#xD;
      have been found to be 143 mm (standard deviation 95,7 mm) [2]. Since the pain sensation after&#xD;
      laparoscopic cholecystectomy is somatic in origin a MERIDIF of 60% (86mm) have been chosen.&#xD;
      Type I and type II errors have been set to 0,05 and 0,20 respectively. This gives a total&#xD;
      number of 42 participants with 21 in allocated to either group. To account for potential&#xD;
      dropouts and the lack of Gaussian distribution for VAS data there will be included a total of&#xD;
      60 participants with 30 allocated to either group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Non-parametric statistics with Fisher´s exact test, Mann-Whitney test and confidence&#xD;
      intervals will be used where appropriate. P &lt; 0,05 will be considered statistical&#xD;
      significant. Drop-outs will be replaced by new participants until a minimum of 30&#xD;
      participants have been included in either group. Data will be analysed with intention-to&#xD;
      treat and per-protocol and the results of both methods will be published.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the TV NOTES group the use of at least one 5mm trans-abdominal port will be considered as&#xD;
      a conversion to conventional laparoscopic surgery and will analysed as such. The use of one&#xD;
      Minilap instrument in the TV NOTES group will not be considered as a conversion to&#xD;
      laparoscopy and the participant will remain in the TV NOTES group for both the&#xD;
      intention-to-treat and the per-protocol analyses. Participants with severe intra-operative&#xD;
      complications will be excluded from the analyses but will be described separately in the&#xD;
      publication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be randomized to either TV NOTES cholecystectomy or conventional&#xD;
      laparoscopic 4 port cholecystectomy. The randomization will be performed shortly before the&#xD;
      operation commences using the envelope method by the operating surgeon. All procedures will&#xD;
      be performed by the same surgeon at University Hospital Gentofte/Herlev, Copenhagen, Denmark.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blinding:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The trial is patient and observer blinded to the allocation of the randomization for the&#xD;
      first 72 hours of the postoperative course. Operating room staff and surgeons will not&#xD;
      participate in any way in the follow-up for the first 72 postoperative hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants in both groups will receive the same surgical dressing on the abdomen after the&#xD;
      procedure. Both groups will thus be bandaged as if after a conventional 4 port laparoscopic&#xD;
      cholecystectomy with a total of 4 dressing strips. In the TV NOTES group these dressings will&#xD;
      be stained red to simulate light seepage from the &quot;wound&quot;. These dressings are obligatory for&#xD;
      the first 72 postoperative hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Informed consent:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participants will receive oral and written information about the trial, its purpose and&#xD;
      potential benefits and risks. Participants will be informed that it is voluntary to&#xD;
      participate at that they at any time can withdraw their consent to participate in the trial&#xD;
      without it having any implications on present or future treatment. Written consent to&#xD;
      participate in the trial will be obtained before enrolment. National guidelines from the&#xD;
      Danish National Committee on Biomedical Research Ethics concerning informed content will be&#xD;
      followed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Any information or medical considerations concerning the individual participant obtained as&#xD;
      part of the trial will be accessible to the participant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS:&#xD;
&#xD;
      TV NOTES cholecystectomy are based on well-established surgical techniques such as&#xD;
      laparoscopy/SILS and culdotomy. Complication types and rates for TV NOTES cholecystectomy are&#xD;
      well described in the literature and are comparable to that of conventional laparoscopic&#xD;
      cholecystectomy. Considering the advantages and theoretical benefits this new technique has&#xD;
      to offer combined with the preliminary retrospective and non-randomized results we find it&#xD;
      ethical to conduct a randomized controlled blinded trial where the benefits of TV NOTES&#xD;
      cholecystectomy outweighs the potential risks involved.&#xD;
&#xD;
      LAW AND APPROVAL:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The trial will be carried out according to the Helsinki Declaration II and under the Acts of&#xD;
      the Danish Council of Ethics and information concerning the participants will be protected in&#xD;
      accordance to the regulations set by the Danish Protection Agency. The trial will be approved&#xD;
      by the Danish National Committee on Biomedical Research Ethics, the Danish Protection Agency&#xD;
      and ClinicalTrials.gov before it is commenced.&#xD;
