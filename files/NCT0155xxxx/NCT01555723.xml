      Background: Treatment of HIV-1 infected Ugandan children with antiretroviral therapy (ART) is&#xD;
      increasing but few prospective long-term studies evaluating the treatment process have been&#xD;
      reported. In this study we sought to determine prospectively how consistent monitoring of&#xD;
      HIV-1 RNA levels impacts the ART treatment process.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: One hundred and eight children initiating ART were enrolled into this study. These&#xD;
      children had comprehensive laboratory monitoring including HIV-1 RNA level determination and&#xD;
      genotype analysis (where appropriate), CD4 % plus absolute counts, and safety laboratory&#xD;
      measurements performed prior to starting therapy and at regular intervals after receiving&#xD;
      ART. Kaplan-Meier statistics were used to examine predictors of survival and virologic&#xD;
      failure. Viral genotype analysis was performed on samples obtained from children having&#xD;
      virologic failure to determent the emergence of mutations.&#xD;

      Study Setting The study was carried out at the Paediatric Infectious Disease Clinic (PIDC)&#xD;
      now Baylor College of Medicine Bristol Myers Squibb Children's Clinical Centre of Excellence&#xD;
      at Mulago Hospital. The PIDC is an HIV outpatient clinic operating 5 days a week with three&#xD;
      paediatric clinics, one adolescent and one family-based clinic. The clinic provides care to&#xD;
      one hundred and eighty children with HIV/AIDS daily. Approximately 50 children per month&#xD;
      qualify for antiretroviral therapy based upon clinical and laboratory parameters.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Makerere University Faculty of Medicine, Research Committee and Ethics Committee, the&#xD;
      Uganda National Council of Science and Technology and IRB boards of Baylor College of&#xD;
      Medicine and the University of Wisconsin Hospital and Clinics approved this study. Informed&#xD;
      consent and assent (when applicable) was obtained from the primary caregiver and/or child&#xD;
      before enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Participants and Enrollment Starting in 2007 children between the ages of 6 weeks and&#xD;
      18 years having confirmed HIV infection and receiving no ART were consecutively enrolled into&#xD;
      this observational cohort study following consent and/or assent (where applicable). Children&#xD;
      were excluded from participation if they were enrolled in another cohort study, or had&#xD;
      psychosocial issues precluding participation (no parent or guardian willing to promote ART&#xD;
      adherence or clinic HIV counselor evaluation of non adherence). The enrollment goal for this&#xD;
      study was approximately100 children recruited over a period of 8 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Initiation of ART and Study Design Children confirmed to be HIV infected were screened with&#xD;
      clinical history and examination by the study physician to determine eligibility. One hundred&#xD;
      and twenty two children were recruited and 111 were enrolled into this prospective cohort&#xD;
      study. Once enrolled a decision to start ART was based upon guidelines set forth by WHO (2006&#xD;
      guidelines with addendum in 2008)/UNAIDS recommendations, the Ugandan National Policy on ART&#xD;
      and laboratory parameters (described below). ART treatment decisions were made at the&#xD;
      discretion of the treating physician. Adherence monitoring was done by means of&#xD;
      self-reporting and pill counts during patient visits to the clinic. Antiretroviral (ARV)&#xD;
      medications used in the study included: zidovudine (AZT), lamivudine (3TC), abacavir (ABC),&#xD;
      stavudine (d4T), nevirapine (NVP), efavirenz (EFV), didanosine (ddI), tenofovir/emtricitabine&#xD;
      (Truvada), lopinavir/ritonavir (Aluvia/Kaletra). History of peripartum NVP use by the child&#xD;
      and/or mother was obtained through interview.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical assessment with disease staging (both WHO and CDC) and baseline laboratory&#xD;
      investigations which included complete blood count (CBC), renal and liver function tests (RFT&#xD;
      and LFT, respectively), CD4%/absolute count, HIV-1 RNA level and genotype were done prior to&#xD;
      the patient starting ART. All blood samples were labeled with a study number that was used&#xD;
      for participant identification. Clinical assessment was done at every patient visit. VL&#xD;
      monitoring was done every three months during the first year of ART follow up and every 6&#xD;
      months thereafter to the end of the study period. CD4%/absolute count and safety laboratory&#xD;
      evaluations were done every 6 months. Genotype evaluation was done prior to starting therapy&#xD;
      and when virological failure was documented. Virologic failure was defined as two consecutive&#xD;
      (for our clinic one month apart) HIV-1 RNA levels &gt;400 copies/ml occurring at any time during&#xD;
      the study period in a child who previously was suppressed or had a 1-2 log10 response to ART;&#xD;
      a persistent viral load elevation (&gt;400 copies/ml) during the first 3 months of ART; or a&#xD;
      viral load &gt;1000 copies/ml on the last blood drawn from a child at the end of the study&#xD;
      period, before death, or at withdrawal or lost to follow-up. Initial virologic response was&#xD;
      defined as a decrease in the HIV-1 RNA level (viral load) of at least 1 log from baseline&#xD;
      after 4-8 weeks of ART. A full virologic response was defined as an HIV-1 RNA level &lt;400&#xD;
      copies/ml (undetectable) by week 24 and/or 48 after starting ART.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Successful immunologic reconstitution was defined as an increase of at least 10 percentage&#xD;
      points over the baseline CD4 percent level occurring within the first year of therapy. An&#xD;
      absolute CD4 cell count response to ART was defined as an increase of 50-150 cells/mm3 over&#xD;
      baseline levels occurring within the first year of therapy. A sustained decline of 5% in the&#xD;
      CD4%, a decline below the pre-therapy CD4% or absolute count or no change in the baseline&#xD;
      CD%/absolute count was used to define immunologic failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Laboratory Measurements Complete blood count (CBC), liver function (ALT), renal function&#xD;
      (creatinine), CD4 percent/absolute count and plasma HIV-1 RNA were performed at the Makerere&#xD;
      University-Johns Hopkins University (MU-JHU) core laboratory, Kampala, Uganda (certified by&#xD;
      the College of American Pathologists). CD4%/ absolute counts were assessed using a BD FACS&#xD;
      Calibur instrument (Becton, Dickinson and Company). The plasma HIV-1 RNA level was measured&#xD;
      using the Amplicor HIV-1 Monitor Test Standard assay (version 1.5, Roche Company, Branchburg,&#xD;
      NJ/USA). We report plasma HIV-1 RNA levels as log10 in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HIV-1 subtyping and genotyping was assessed using the GeneSeq technique at Monogram&#xD;
      Bioscience, South San Francisco CA/USA. In this assay, amplifying the pool of virus variants&#xD;
      in the plasma sample using the polymerase chain reaction (adapted for use with non-subtype B&#xD;
      virus) product enabled construct of resistance vector DNA pools. Deduced amino acid sequences&#xD;
      and drug susceptibility of sample virus were compared with a reference virus strain to&#xD;
      identify mutations. Genotype analysis was conducted only on blood samples having &gt;1000 copies&#xD;
      of virus particles per ml. The GeneSeq HIV assay detects minor virus populations at&#xD;
      concentrations above 10-20%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis Survival and virologic treatment failure analyses were evaluated with&#xD;
      Kaplan-Meier statistics. Cox Regression multivariate analysis and Kaplan-Meier statistics&#xD;
      were used to examine the relationship of clinical and laboratory parameters to virologic&#xD;
      failure and a t-test of significance was used to evaluate the immunologic (mean CD4&#xD;
      %/absolute count at different time points) response to ART.&#xD;
