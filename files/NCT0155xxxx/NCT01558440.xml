      Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      During rehabilitation phase of management of severe acute malnourished Bangladeshi infants&#xD;
      less than 6 months old, rates of weight gain will be significantly more in children fed F-100&#xD;
      and diluted F-100 compared to those fed infant formula.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Brief summary:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Until recently, severe malnutrition has been relatively rare in infants younger than 6&#xD;
      months, but with urbanization and the HIV/AIDS pandemic it is feared that the incidence of&#xD;
      severe malnutrition among young infants will rise. The question of how best to feed infants&#xD;
      aged &lt;6 months has thus come to the forefront. Given the lack of published evidence regarding&#xD;
      the most advantageous formulations for feeding severely malnourished infants aged &lt;6 months,&#xD;
      there is a need for observational studies and comparative randomized trials of alternative&#xD;
      formulations to guide decisions about optimum dietary management in this age group. This area&#xD;
      has been aptly considered a research priority during the consultation meeting of experts from&#xD;
      all over the world convened by the World Health Organization on management of severe&#xD;
      malnutrition in September 2004.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the WHO case-management guidelines for severe malnutrition, there is no separate provision&#xD;
      for young infants (infants less than 6 months old). The guidelines suggest the use of a&#xD;
      low-solute formula (F-75) and continued breastfeeding in the initial stabilisation phase. In&#xD;
      the rehabilitation phase, the guidelines advise F-100 with an energy density of 100kcal/100ml&#xD;
      to promote catch-up growth. There is a concern that the renal solute load from using F-100 is&#xD;
      too high for young infants, and some groups have started using diluted F-100 with an energy&#xD;
      density of 75 kcal/100 ml.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Another related issue is the contribution of breastfeeding in dietary intakes during&#xD;
      rehabilitation. In severely malnourished infants, breast milk intakes are likely to be low&#xD;
      initially when appetite is poor, but may be substantial as the infant recovers. Uncertainty&#xD;
      about breast milk intakes has led to conflicting opinions and advice, weaning from the breast&#xD;
      as it is not providing sufficient energy (1).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study, to be conducted in a carefully supervised Nutrition Rehabilitation&#xD;
      Unit (NRU), will compare three recovery diets (Infant formula, F-100 and diluted F-100) in&#xD;
      order to provide the evidence-base to determine if a change or add-on in terms of diet in the&#xD;
      WHO guidelines is needed. It will also measure the potential renal solute load (mosmol/l),&#xD;
      serum electrolytes and plasma osmolality of the same children. Body composition of the&#xD;
      infants will also be measured using stable isotope dilution technique before and after the&#xD;
      intervention diet is provided.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Study design: This is a randomized controlled trial comparing three recovery diets and will&#xD;
      be conducted at a Nutrition Rehabilitation Unit (NRU).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Duration of the study: 24 months. Study site: The trial will take place at the Dhaka Hospital&#xD;
      of ICDDR, Bangladesh. This hospital has a high case load, peaking during April-October, and&#xD;
      the WHO guidelines for the management of severely malnourished children with minor&#xD;
      modifications are followed. Diarrhoea is the entry point for all patients attending the&#xD;
      hospital including children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods During the stabilization phase or the acute phase management, children will be fed&#xD;
      every 2 hourly with 130ml/kg/day F-75 along with other necessary management according to WHO&#xD;
      guidelines (8). Judgment regarding suitability for transfer to the rehabilitation phase will&#xD;
      be made by the regular doctors at the longer-stay ward according to set criteria: i) return&#xD;
      of appetite (i.e. hungry, easily finishes a feed), ii) naso-gastric feeding is not required,&#xD;
      iii) absent or insignificant oedema, iv) cessation of vomiting, v) less than 3 watery&#xD;
      stools/day, and vi) no clinical signs of infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When ready for the rehabilitation phase, eligible children will be transferred to the NRU and&#xD;
      randomized to receive any of the three diets (Infant formula, F-100 or diluted F-100). For&#xD;
      the first 2 days on the test diets, they will be fed 130ml/kg/day in 12 (2-hourly) feeds and&#xD;
      then 10ml more at each feed until some is left. This is equivalent to the transition phase in&#xD;
      the WHO guidelines. During these 2 days the infants' pulse and respiration rates will be&#xD;
      monitored 3 hourly to find out the signs of possible fluid overload. Thereafter they will be&#xD;
      fed at 3 hour intervals. Infants will be fed by trained research personnel and will be&#xD;
      encouraged to eat until full. Being 'full' will be defined as two successive refusals when&#xD;
      feed is re-offered. Water will be freely available between feeds. Breastfed children will&#xD;
      continue to be breastfed. Pulse and respiration rates and temperature will be monitored every&#xD;
      8 hours. If, any of the infants shows the signs of fluid overload, they will be transferred&#xD;
      to longer-stay or special care ward and will be managed according to the standardized&#xD;
      management protocol practiced at Dhaka Hospital of ICDDR,B.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All the children who are accompanied by mothers will be counselled by professional&#xD;
      breastfeeding counsellor for relactation if the child is already weaned from the breast.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measurement of the diets: All feeding episodes will take place under the supervision of study&#xD;
      personnel. Food portions will be weighed before and after serving using an electronic balance&#xD;
      with one-gram precision, and the actual amount consumed will be calculated by subtracting&#xD;
      leftover food from the amount offered. Pre-weighed napkins will be provided; any food that is&#xD;
      regurgitated, vomited or spilled will be swabbed, weighed and subtracted from the amount&#xD;
      offered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measurement of breast milk intake: If, the particular child is breastfed or the re-lactation&#xD;
      has been established, then the mothers will be requested to breastfeed day and night,&#xD;
      according to the usual feeding pattern at home prior to the study or if the child demands. At&#xD;
      each nursing, breast milk will be offered until the child refuses further intake, and the&#xD;
      amount consumed will be measured by test-weighing before and after nursing, while ensuring&#xD;
      that the child wears the same clothing for each weighing. Each nursing episode initiated&#xD;
      after taking a post-feeding weight will be considered a new episode, and the intake will be&#xD;
      similarly measured. Breast milk intake will be measured by recording the difference in the&#xD;
      child's weight before and after the feed, using an electronic balance with two-gram&#xD;
      precision, and the weight change will be adjusted for child-specific insensible losses, which&#xD;
      will be measured on the same balance for at least 30 minutes each day. The duration of each&#xD;
      episode of breast-feeding will be measured using a stopwatch, and the duration and frequency&#xD;
      of breastfeeding in 24 hours will also be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Discharge criteria: Body weight gain 15% of the admission bodyweight or as soon as the infant&#xD;
      becomes oedema free or if the child has an oedema free weight-for-length Z-score â‰¥ 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up: At the time of discharge, the mother/caregiver will be asked to bring his/her&#xD;
      child to the nutritional follow-up unit after 2 weeks, then monthly for 3 months. In every&#xD;
      visit the child will be measured for weight, height and mid-upper arm circumference and will&#xD;
      also be examined for any possible illness(s). If, any of the child fails to come for&#xD;
      scheduled follow-up, study personnel will visit their respective homes to know the well-being&#xD;
      and status of the subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Deuterium Oxide Dilution Technique for the Assessment of Body composition:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following procedure for assessment of body composition will be conducted on the day the&#xD;
      infant will be transferred to the NRU and repeated at the time of discharge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Deuterium oxide (2H2O) will be used for body composition assessment. Upon enrolment, baseline&#xD;
      saliva samples will be collected. After collection of baseline saliva samples 5g of deuterium&#xD;
      oxide labelled water will be fed to the study infant. Children should avoid drinking water&#xD;
      during the equilibration period, i.e., 3-4 hours after ingestion of the stable isotope dose.&#xD;
      According to the recommendation from International atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) field manual&#xD;
      (9), two post-dose saliva samples will be collected at 3rd and 4th hours. The concentration&#xD;
      of deuterium oxide in saliva samples will be measured with Fourier Transform Infrared&#xD;
      Spectrometer (FTIR) and for total body water (TBW) estimation. Afterward from measured TBW,&#xD;
      the amount of fat free mass (FFM) can be estimated. Body fat mass (FM) is the difference&#xD;
      between body weight and fat free mass (10).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore for each child, saliva samples will be collected 6 times (2 baseline and 4 post&#xD;
      dose) during the course of NRU stay.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Calculation of body composition:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The dilution space of 2H (VD) is 4.1 % higher than TBW due to exchange of H with non-aqueous&#xD;
      H in the body TBW (kg) = VD /1.041 Where, VD (kg) = Dose 2H2O (mg)/enrichment 2H in saliva&#xD;
      (mg/kg) FFM (kg) = TBW (kg) / hydration coefficient*&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Hydration factor = Hydration of FFM (%FFM)/100 Fat mass (FM) is calculated by difference&#xD;
           between body weight and FFM FM (kg) = body weight (kg) - FFM (kg) Results are often&#xD;
           expressed as % body weight FM (%) = FM (kg) / body weight (kg) x 100&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Please see Table 2; Hydration factor for children (11, 12) Randomization After assessing&#xD;
           suitable for initiating the rehabilitation phase, infants will be randomized to the test&#xD;
           diets in blocks of 6 using a random numbers table (EPI-INFO 6.04, CDC Atlanta, GA).&#xD;
           Allocation will be concealed in sealed envelopes. The codes will be kept secure and not&#xD;
           broken until data analysis is complete. Medical and nursing staff and the children's&#xD;
           carers will be blind as to the formula given. Infant formula, F-100 and diluted F-100&#xD;
           will be similar as much as possible in appearance and will be prepared by the dietician.&#xD;
           The invitation to participate in the research will be given at admission before&#xD;
           randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Rate of weight gain (g/kg/day):&#xD;
&#xD;
           Body weight will be measured daily with a digital scale, precision 2g.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Calculation of weight gain (13,14,15):&#xD;
&#xD;
           Weight gain in g/kg.day = (W2 - W1) x 1000/(W1 x number of days from W1 to W2)&#xD;
&#xD;
           Where:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  W1 = lowest weight during the NRW stay in kg (usually the 1st day of NRW-weight in&#xD;
                case of marasmic children, but it may vary in case of oedematous children)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  W2 = weight in kg on the day of calculation&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Intake (kcal/kg/day):&#xD;
&#xD;
           During the stay at NRU, amounts of the test diets offered and eaten, and water consumed,&#xD;
           will be recorded by the research assistants.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Renal solute load (mOsmol/l):&#xD;
&#xD;
           Potential renal solute load: PRSL = N/28 + Na + C1 + K + Pa Where, N= Nitrogen content&#xD;
           of the diet (mg/28=mosm) Na= Sodium content of the diet (mg/23=mosm) Cl= Sodium content&#xD;
           of the diet (mg/35=mosm) K= Potassium content of the diet (mg/39=mosm) Pa= Available&#xD;
           Phosphorous content of the diet (mg/31=mosm)&#xD;
&#xD;
           0.9 mOsm of PRSL are retained per gram of weight gain (4). RSL will, therefore, be&#xD;
           estimated using the equation: RSL est = PRSL - (0.9 x gain) Where: RSL est and PRSL are&#xD;
           expressed as mOsmoles per day and gain is weight gain in grams per day (7).&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Serum sodium and plasma osmolality:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Two ml blood will be taken from antecubital vein of the child on days 1, 3, and 7 for&#xD;
           measuring serum sodium, potassium, chloride, total carbon dioxide, creatinine and&#xD;
           osmolality. This will allow monitoring of osmolar state of the child i.e. hypernatremia.&#xD;
           Spot urine samples on the above mentioned days will be checked for specific gravity and&#xD;
           osmolality/creatinine ratio. Urine will be collected in paediatric urine collector bags.&#xD;
           Standard methods will be used for measuring electrolytes, creatinine, osmolality and&#xD;
           specific gravity in the Clinical Biochemistry Laboratory of ICDDR,B.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Extra-renal water losses: Loss of body fluids due to diarrhoea and vomiting will be&#xD;
           recorded, as will fever, environmental temperature and humidity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome measures:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Rate of weight gain (g/kg/day)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Food Intake (kcal/kg/day)&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Breast milk intake (if the child is breastfed) (g/kg/d) and (kcal/kg/d)&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Renal solute load (mOsmol/l):&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size estimation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In NRU of Dhaka Hospital of ICDDR,B, 124 children suffering from SAM who were managed with&#xD;
      infant formula along with other recommended WHO-guidelines had a daily mean Â± SD weight gain&#xD;
      of 10.25 Â± 6.7 g/kg/day. If, we assume that with F-100 or diluted F-100 the rate of weight&#xD;
      gain will be 15 g/kg/d, then we require 40 children in each group with 80% power and 5% level&#xD;
      of significance. If, the investigators further consider 10% attrition then each group will&#xD;
      require 44 infants. So, the investigators will study 44 infant in each group giving a total&#xD;
      of 132 children in three study groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      data Analysis: All recording forms will be pre-coded and checked daily for completeness and&#xD;
      consistency. Differences among the groups will be assessed using chi-squared tests for&#xD;
      proportions and analysis of variance (ANOVA) for normally-distributed continuous variables.&#xD;
      Paired t-test for paired comparison before and after the intervention will be performed. The&#xD;
      analysis will be on an intention-to-treat basis. Statistical analysis will be with the&#xD;
      Statistical Package for the Social Sciences, version 11.5 for Windows (SPSS Inc, Chicago,&#xD;
      Ill). Subgroup analyses will be conducted to test if age has a differential effect on renal&#xD;
      solute load among the groups.&#xD;
