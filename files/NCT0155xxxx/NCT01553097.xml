  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This longitudinal project will investigate a common complaint of women who receive&#xD;
      chemotherapy for breast cancer- cognitive difficulty. The relationships of fatigue, stress,&#xD;
      and depression to cognitive difficulties will be examined. The findings should lead to&#xD;
      interventions to decrease the effects of these problematic side effects.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Most women with breast cancer are diagnosed in the early stages of the disease (Stage I and&#xD;
      II) and 90% of these can expect to survive at least 5 years. Adjuvant chemotherapy regimens&#xD;
      for breast cancer are often associated with complaints of cognitive changes, mostly the&#xD;
      inability to concentrate and memory lapses that may persist in some women long after&#xD;
      chemotherapy has ended. These changes are frequently accompanied by reports of a triad of&#xD;
      behavioral conditions: fatigue, increased stress, and depressive symptoms. Biologically,&#xD;
      cytokine release patterns play an important role in regulation of the immune system and&#xD;
      normal CNS function, including neural cell repair and metabolism of neurotransmitters-both&#xD;
      critical for normal cognitive functioning. Thus, the theoretical underpinnings of this&#xD;
      research are embedded in the biobehavioral (mind-body) model which characterizes the&#xD;
      multidimensional interactions among the mind, neuroendocrine, and immune systems. The purpose&#xD;
      of this prospective, longitudinal project of 100 women is to determine whether there are&#xD;
      differences in cognitive functioning and related behavioral conditions (fatigue, perceived&#xD;
      stress, and depressive symptoms) in women in each of 3 groups: those with early stage BC&#xD;
      treated with surgery and chemotherapy, women with early stage BC treated with surgery and&#xD;
      without chemotherapy and an age-gender-education-matched healthy cohort without cancer. The&#xD;
      primary aim of the project is to examine the relationships among fatigue, perceived stress,&#xD;
      and depressive symptoms and neurocognitive impairment. A secondary aim is to explore the&#xD;
      relationships among key behavioral and biological markers that may explain underlying&#xD;
      mechanisms for development of neurocognitive impairment. In particular, this project will&#xD;
      explore pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokine patterns and their potential associations with&#xD;
      neurocognitive functioning. For the primary aim, the mixed linear model will be used to test&#xD;
      for differences between the groups. For analysis of the secondary aim variable reduction&#xD;
      stage and correlation will be used. The strength of this project is its biobehavioral&#xD;
      approach to discerning underlying mechanisms of neurocognitive impairment in women with early&#xD;
      stage BC receiving adjuvant chemotherapy. In addition, three other common behavioral&#xD;
      conditions associated with BC and/or chemotherapy, fatigue, perceived stress, and depressive&#xD;
      symptoms, will be evaluated for their potentially confounding effects on cognitive function.&#xD;

        Participants in the two BC groups will be recruited from the Massey Cancer Center (MCC)&#xD;
        clinical sites in Richmond, VA. Healthy volunteers will be recruited throughout the VCU&#xD;
        Health System and through women's groups throughout the greater Richmond, VA area. The PI&#xD;
        will provide physicians and clinical nurses an overview of the research and work with them&#xD;
        to identify potential project participants. Participants will be provided oral and written&#xD;
        information about the research and given an opportunity to ask questions or discuss the&#xD;
        project with family or significant others.&#xD;
