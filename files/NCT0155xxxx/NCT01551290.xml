  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of infliximab in&#xD;
      Chinese patients with active ulcerative colitis (swelling and ulceration of large intestine&#xD;
      and rectum).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter (study conducted at multiple sites), randomized (the study medication&#xD;
      is assigned by chance), placebo controlled (placebo is an inactive substance that is compared&#xD;
      with a medication to test whether the medication has a real effect in a clinical study),&#xD;
      double blind (neither investigator nor patient knows the treatment that the patient&#xD;
      receives), 2-arm (2 groups), parallel group (a clinical study comparing the response in two&#xD;
      or more groups of participants receiving different treatments) study with infliximab in&#xD;
      patients with active ulcerative colitis. The study consists of screening period (4 weeks&#xD;
      prior to baseline [patient's medical status before any treatment or research is done] at Week&#xD;
      0), treatment period (Week 0 to Week 22) and follow up period (Week 26). Participants&#xD;
      completing treatment till Week 22 and benefit from continued treatment (in the opinion of the&#xD;
      investigator) may enter a study extension period from Week 30 until Week 58. Hundred&#xD;
      participants will be randomized to 2 groups: Group 1 (50 participants receiving placebo) and&#xD;
      Group 2 (50 participants receiving infliximab). Effectiveness and safety (physical&#xD;
      examination, and a review of AEs, vital signs, laboratory analyses, and concomitant&#xD;
      medications) will be evaluated at Week 8 and Week 26 and at Week 58 (for participants who&#xD;
      enter extension phase). The maximum duration for participants in the main study is 26 weeks.&#xD;
      The maximum duration for participants including study extension is 58 weeks. One of the&#xD;
      specialized procedures used to calculate efficacy will be Mayo score which is calculated&#xD;
      using the subscore (recorded in Mayo Diary Card by each participant) of the following 4&#xD;
      variables (1) stool frequency (scores ranging from 0 [normal number stools for this patient]&#xD;
      to 3 [5 or more stools more than normal]), (2) rectal bleeding (scores ranging from 0 [no&#xD;
      blood seen] to 3 [blood alone passed]), (3) endoscopic findings (scores ranging from 0&#xD;
      [normal or inactive disease] to 3 [severe disease ie, spontaneous bleeding and ulceration]),&#xD;
      and (4) the physician's global assessment (scores ranging from 0 [normal] to 3 [severe&#xD;
      disease]).&#xD;

    <description>At Week 8, clinical response is defined as a decrease from baseline (closest measurement taken prior to or at the time of the initiation of the baseline [Week 0] infusion) in the Mayo score by ≥30% and ≥3 points, with a decrease in the rectal bleeding subscore of ≥1 or a rectal bleeding subscore of 0 or 1, at Week 8.</description>

    <description>A clinical remission at Week 8 is defined as a Mayo score ≤2 points, with no individual subscore &gt;1. Participants in remission by this definition will have rectal bleeding subscore of either 0 or 1.</description>
