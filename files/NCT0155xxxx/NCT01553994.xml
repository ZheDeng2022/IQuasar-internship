      Overview and rationale: Through Swedish health care registers it is possible vaccine&#xD;
      effectiveness. The overall aim is to develop tools for fast and reliable evaluation of&#xD;
      vaccines focusing on effectiveness. In this study the investigators will assess the&#xD;
      population impact on condyloma prescribed drugs after HPV-vaccination and to estimate the&#xD;
      economic burden of hospitalizations due to condyloma. Genital warts (condyloma) are one of&#xD;
      the most common sexually transmitted diseases in Sweden, estimated 20 000 identified cases&#xD;
      per year, and are primarily treated with Podofyllotoxin and Immiquimod. One of the approved&#xD;
      HPV vaccines also protects against condyloma. In clinical trials, this vaccine is safe and&#xD;
      highly efficacious (90-100%) against persistent infection with HPV 6 and 11 and genital warts&#xD;
      in women and men. However, these results are from clinical trials and do not answer the&#xD;
      question weather the vaccine works when delivered, as it would be in the real world. By&#xD;
      linkage between the Svevac, the patient register and the Drug prescription register the&#xD;
      investigators can estimate the effectiveness of the HPV vaccine in preventing cases of&#xD;
      condyloma in a defined population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Method and execution: This is a retrospective collection of data from Swedish health care&#xD;
      registries where the study population will consist of persons who are HPV-vaccinated as well&#xD;
      as a non-HPV-vaccinated control group (identified through the population-based register,&#xD;
      matched on sex, age and living area). The primary statistical analysis will be a calculation&#xD;
      of prescriptions of condyloma treatments after vaccination compared to the non-vaccinated&#xD;
      control group.&#xD;

      GARDASIL® POPULATION-BASED CONDYLOMA EFFECTIVENESS STUDY IN SWEDISH WOMEN BACKGROUND Human&#xD;
      papilloma virus (HPV) has been established as a necessary but not sufficient cause of&#xD;
      cervical cancer. Over 100 HPV types have been identified, of which 40 infect the genital&#xD;
      tract. HPV16, followed by HPV18, are the most frequent in cervical cancer and contribute to&#xD;
      70% of all invasive cervical cancers. All together, around 15 high-risk (or oncogenic) HPV&#xD;
      types have been identified. Cervical cancer is the second most common cancer among women&#xD;
      globally, with an estimated half a million new cases and a quarter of a million deaths each&#xD;
      year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two of the 40 genital HPV types, 6 and 11, are so called low risk types causing genital warts&#xD;
      (condyloma). Genital warts are one of the most common sexually transmitted infections and the&#xD;
      clinical burden has been increasing the past decades. The warts are benign but often cause&#xD;
      mental or emotional stress in those experiencing them.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are two available vaccines against HPV. Both of these vaccines have shown 95% efficacy&#xD;
      against HPV16 and 18-related precancerous lesions in clinical trials but the follow-up time&#xD;
      is so far limited to 5.5 years. One of the vaccines, Gardasil®, also offers protection&#xD;
      against HPV 6 and 11. In clinical trials, this vaccine is safe and highly efficacious&#xD;
      (90-100%) against persistent infection with HPV 6 and 11 and genital warts in women and men.&#xD;
      Recently the first study on the effect of Gardasil® on national population level was&#xD;
      published. The study showed a substantial decline of condyloma in Australian women after&#xD;
      introduction of GARDASIL®. However, there were some limitations to this study. It was not&#xD;
      based on entirely true population-based data, they could not adjust for residency status and&#xD;
      they could not link cases to vaccination status.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to investigate whether Gardasil® is effective against condyloma in&#xD;
      vaccinated women compared to non-vaccinated women by using registry-based data. The study is&#xD;
      also going to investigate whether Gardasil® has an effect on cases with previous history of&#xD;
      condyloma, which is possible with our data. Further, we will try to estimate the economic&#xD;
      burden of hospital visits due to genital warts and investigate whether Gardasil® has an&#xD;
      affect on these hospital visits. It is estimated that out of 20 000 visits to health care,&#xD;
      for condyloma, one third requires surgery due to recurrence, and of those one third will&#xD;
      require surgery again. The study will take advantage of the unique Swedish population-based&#xD;
      health care databases, which allows linking and follow-up at the individual level.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OBJECTIVES&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the population impact on Podofyllotoxin/Aldara prescription and hospital&#xD;
           visits on condyloma in Sweden after vaccination with GARDASIL®.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess if vaccination with GARDASIL® has an effect on recurrence of genital warts.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To estimate the economic burden of hospital visits due to genital warts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MATERIALS AND METHODS Study design The study is a historically prospective analysis of&#xD;
      population-based nationwide cohorts comprising participants with individual-level&#xD;
      longitudinal information on HPV vaccination status and prescription of Podofyllotoxin/Aldara.&#xD;
      Vaccination status will be obtained from national vaccination registers, and drug&#xD;
      prescription register (Sweden) and information about Podofyllotoxin/Aldara from the drug&#xD;
      prescription register. Information about hospital visits due to genital warts will be&#xD;
      obtained from the national in- and out patient registry. The study is observational and as&#xD;
      such vaccination will be according to local regulations, policies and practices.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Registers used HPV vaccination status will be obtained from the Swedish vaccination register&#xD;
      (SVEVAC) and the Swedish drug prescription register. The Swedish vaccination register&#xD;
      (SVEVAC) currently registers, through a user-friendly web-based large-scale system, all HPV&#xD;
      vaccinations in Sweden nationally, since the start of HPV vaccination in 2006. SVEVAC holds&#xD;
      information on personal ID-number, sex, age, date of vaccination, time of vaccination, type&#xD;
      of vaccine, vaccine lot number, and health unit (county and municipality). Registration with&#xD;
      personal ID-number is voluntary, but subject must actively state if they don't want to be&#xD;
      registered. Written information to the subject and inquiry on consent for all aspects of the&#xD;
      registration and register based follow-up will be administered in an efficient way (subject&#xD;
      to approval from Ethics Committee). Present experience with HPV vaccination is that 95% of&#xD;
      vaccinated subjects accept this registration. In Sweden opportunistic HPV vaccination has&#xD;
      been available since May 2006 and is recommended to young adults. The vaccine has been&#xD;
      subsidised for girls age 13-17 since May 2007 through the Swedish drug reimbursement system.&#xD;
      A prescription from a medical doctor is then required. All drug prescriptions are since 2005&#xD;
      registered in a national drug prescription register. To compare all HPV vaccinated subjects&#xD;
      the drug prescription register will be scrutinized to complete information on HPV&#xD;
      vaccination. The drug register holds information on prescription date, number of doses,&#xD;
      ID-number, sex, type of vaccination. Today approximately 100 000 Swedish females have been&#xD;
      vaccinated with the HPV vaccine, as well as 800 males. The majority of vaccinations were with&#xD;
      Gardasil® (98%).&#xD;
&#xD;
      From the drug prescription register we will obtain information on Podofyllotoxina and Aldara&#xD;
      prescriptions, date of prescription and dose. In the majority of cases prescriptions are for&#xD;
      self-treatment at home.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All in-patient health care in Sweden is registered with personal ID-number at a national&#xD;
      level since 1987. The so-called Patient register is kept by the Swedish National Board of&#xD;
      Health and Welfare (NBHW). From 2001, out-patient care at hospitals has been included in this&#xD;
      register. Information on adverse events will be obtained from this register. The&#xD;
      International Classification of Diseases 10th revision (ICD-10) has been used to code&#xD;
      diagnoses since 1997.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Many specialist clinics are based at hospitals and using patient register it will be possible&#xD;
      to catch visits to those clinics as well as day surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population and study size This is a population-based study and will comprise&#xD;
      girls/women vaccinated with GARDASIL® in Sweden between May 2005 and October 2010. The study&#xD;
      will also include all women who were prescribed Podofylloxin/Aldara between January 2005 and&#xD;
      December 2010 and also women who have a recorded hospital visit due to genital warts from&#xD;
      2005 to December 2009. The study cohort will include girls/women born between 1989 and 1996.&#xD;
      In this way we will include the oldest and youngest girls/women who may benefit from&#xD;
      subsidised vaccination within the study period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As of October 2010, 98% of the vaccinations registered were Gardasil®. 108 670 women have&#xD;
      been vaccinated with at least one dose, 92 296 with two doses and 66 150 with three doses.&#xD;
      Approximately 87% of the vaccinated girls/women are between 13 to 17 years of age and 10% are&#xD;
      between 18-25 years of age. In a report from the NBHW (2007) the estimated number of cases&#xD;
      with condyloma is about 20 000 every year, taking both prescription of Podofyllotoxin/Aldara&#xD;
      and hospital visits into account. Approximately half of those are women.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To link information on vaccination status, and health care data from population based&#xD;
      registers data the Swedish personal ID number will be used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study outcome To study the effect of Gardasil on condyloma incidence we will compare&#xD;
      incidence of genital warts in vaccinated versus non-vaccinated women. The majority of cases&#xD;
      will be identified through the Drug prescription register and about 20% will be found in&#xD;
      patient register. To find cases through the Drug prescription register ACT codes will be used&#xD;
      for Podofyllotoxin and Aldara (see below) and ICD-10 codes for the In- and Out patient&#xD;
      registers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The described register will also be used to investigate whether vaccination with Gardasil has&#xD;
      changed the burden of recurrent warts by identifying women who had genital warts before&#xD;
      vaccination and after and compare with those not vaccinated. The burden of hospital visits&#xD;
      will also be investigated by comparing vaccinated and non-vaccinated women.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ACT codes used in the Drug prescription register ACT-code used for Gardasil®: J07BM01&#xD;
      ACT-code for Podofyllotoxin: D06BB04 ACT-code used for Aldara: D06BB10 ICD-10 codes Hospital&#xD;
      visit due to genital warts will be found in the in- and out patient register. The ICD-10 code&#xD;
      used to indentify patients are: A63 and D26.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical methods This is a cohort study and the data will be analyzed using statistical&#xD;
      methods for survival analysis. In particular, to study the population impact on genital wart&#xD;
      incidence in Sweden after vaccination with GARDASIL® we will model the association between&#xD;
      exposure (vaccination status) and outcome (genital warts determined via either prescription&#xD;
      of Podophyllotoxin/Aldara or hospital visit due to genital warts) using Cox and/or Poisson&#xD;
      regression. Incidence rate ratios (IRR) and 95 % confidence intervals will be used to&#xD;
      quantify the effect of the vaccine on the risk for genital warts. All girls will be followed&#xD;
      up from May 2006 and attained age will be used as the underlying time scale in the model.&#xD;
      Because full effectiveness of the vaccine is assumed to be achieved after 3 doses the&#xD;
      exposure will be included in the statistical model as a time-varying exposure classified from&#xD;
      no vaccination (unexposed), partially completed vaccination (1 to 2 doses) and fully&#xD;
      vaccinated (exposed). The analysis will account for possible confounding factors such as&#xD;
      sexual risk taking behaviors, using genital wart history as marker, socioeconomic status of&#xD;
      the parents and type of prescribed treatment (Podophyllotoxin orAldara).&#xD;
&#xD;
      To assess risk of recurrence of condyloma, IRR adjusted for prior genital wart history,&#xD;
      determined in the same way as for outcome, will be used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To estimate temporal trends in the economic burden of hospital visits due to genital warts we&#xD;
      will identify and report descriptive data on all recorded hospital visits due to genital&#xD;
      warts in the Swedish Patient registries as a function of calendar year (2005-2009) as well as&#xD;
      mode of treatment (Podophyllotoxin/Aldara /surgery).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Limitations We cannot exclude that we will not be able to catch all cases that seek medical&#xD;
      care. Some cases that visit primary health care may be treated during the visit and this will&#xD;
      not be recorded anywhere. However, most of these cases do receive a prescription for&#xD;
      self-treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Because the majority of vaccinees are between 13-17 years of age they may not have had&#xD;
      genital warts before vaccination and therefore recurrence of warts may be difficult to catch&#xD;
      in our study population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethical approval The study will be conducted after approval of the Ethics Committee of&#xD;
      Karolinska Institutet.&#xD;
