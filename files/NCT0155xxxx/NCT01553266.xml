      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the implementation of the Mobile Diabetes Education&#xD;
      Team (MDET) intervention in the Greater Toronto Area, as well as the intervention's&#xD;
      effectiveness in improving patient clinical and care process outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study's hypotheses are that the MDET intervention results in the following outcomes:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Improvement in patient clinical outcomes;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  An increase in the proportion of primary care physicians (PCPs) performing patient care&#xD;
           processes according to clinical practice guidelines;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  An increase in the proportion of referrals to, and patients' utilization of, diabetes&#xD;
           education programs (DEPs).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The proposed research is the first evaluation of the implementation of Mobile Diabetes&#xD;
      Education Teams (MDETs) in Canada. This intervention will support primary care providers&#xD;
      (PCPs) by offering a diabetes education team (one registered nurse [RN] and one registered&#xD;
      dietitian [RD]) one to four times a month, based on patient volume, at various primary care&#xD;
      sites to assist in and share the care and management of patients with diabetes. This&#xD;
      intervention is in collaboration with the Mississauga Halton Local Health Integration Network&#xD;
      (MH LHIN) and will be hosted by Trillium Diabetes Management Centre and Halton Diabetes&#xD;
      Program. Each hosting site received permanent operational funding for half a diabetes&#xD;
      education team (salary support) from the Ontario Ministry of Health and Long-term Care&#xD;
      (MHLTC) under the new Ontario Diabetes Strategy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The rationale for incorporating MDETs in primary care was guided by the extensive literature&#xD;
      on the underuse and low referral to diabetes education programs (DEPs), where diabetes&#xD;
      self-management education is primarily offered. Low utilization is due to low PCP referral&#xD;
      rates to these services, as well as numerous systematic and operational barriers for both&#xD;
      PCPs and patients. Consequently, the majority of Canadians are receiving diabetes care solely&#xD;
      from their PCPs, who have expressed barriers to caring for diabetes patients and are&#xD;
      providing sub-optimal care as they are not consistently adhering to clinical practice&#xD;
      guidelines. As a result, MHLTC is investing millions of dollars in expanding and aligning&#xD;
      current programs to increase access to team-based care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this research is to evaluate a structural redesign in how the investigators&#xD;
      deliver diabetes care and self-management education using a collaborative approach between&#xD;
      PCPs and DEPs guided by the Chronic Care Model as a conceptual framework. The purpose of this&#xD;
      research is twofold: 1) to evaluate the effects of MDET intervention on: (i) patient clinical&#xD;
      outcomes; (ii) quality of care patients receive from PCPs; (iii) PCPs' referral to and their&#xD;
      patients' utilization of DEPs; and 2) to assess the implementation processes of the MDET&#xD;
      intervention and the degree of collaboration and team functioning between PCPs and the MDET&#xD;
      members across primary care sites. A mixed-methods approach is proposed over a three year&#xD;
      period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be referred to the MDET by PCPs. The MDET will meet with patients for two hours&#xD;
      (one hour with the RN and one hour with the RD) to assess the level of diabetes knowledge,&#xD;
      diabetes self-care and lifestyle habits; this data will be used to develop patient treatment&#xD;
      priorities and action care plans. Three 30 minute follow-up visits with the MDET will be&#xD;
      carried out over a one-year period for all patients where patient action plans are reviewed,&#xD;
      discussed and potentially revised. A communication tool has been developed to better&#xD;
      facilitate communication of patient information between PCPs and MDETs. Case conferences will&#xD;
      be conducted when major changes are to be made to the patient's treatment plan after a&#xD;
      patient's visit. Accordingly, PCPs and educators are collaboratively managing patient care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A cluster-randomized trial stepped wedge design will be used to ensure all sites will&#xD;
      eventually receive the intervention, while still facilitating the comparison of change within&#xD;
      individuals and between study groups across time points that is attributed to the&#xD;
      intervention. The inclusion criteria for reviewing patient medical records are patients who&#xD;
      are over 18 years of age, have type 2 diabetes, and have an HbA1c of greater than 8%. Twenty&#xD;
      unique patient chart extractions will be performed at 0, 6, 12, 18, 24 months from 12 primary&#xD;
      care sites to collect patient care processes and patient clinical outcome data (for a total&#xD;
      of 1,200 patient charts). Characteristics of interprofessional collaboration between PCPs and&#xD;
      the MDET will be assessed at each practice site at the end of one year. To assess the&#xD;
      implementation of the MDET across sites, qualitative process data, such as in-depth&#xD;
      interviews with patients, PCPs and the MDETs, and MDETs' field notes and debriefing sessions&#xD;
      will be analyzed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MDETs will strengthen and formalize links between primary care providers and diabetes&#xD;
      education programs within the community, increase patient access to diabetes self-management&#xD;
      education and support, and potentially improve patient experience and clinical outcomes&#xD;
      through enhanced coordination and integration of care. This study is timely and relevant as&#xD;
      DEPs and local PCPs are starting to integrate services across Canada; thus, our research will&#xD;
      provide the evidence necessary to inform practice of such a model. If results are promising,&#xD;
      this model can be extended to direct how those with impaired glucose tolerance and&#xD;
      gestational diabetes/post-gestational diabetes; and as a result, diabetes prevention,&#xD;
      management and care are delivered, and can greatly reduce the burden of diabetes in Canada.&#xD;
