    <textblock>
      This project is the first comprehensive prospective study of clinically non-functioning&#xD;
      pituitary adenomas (CNFAs). Two groups of subjects will be studied: Group I will consist of&#xD;
      100 patients with clinically non-functioning (CNF) pituitary lesions who are asymptomatic and&#xD;
      do not require surgery; Group II will consist of 250 patients who have pituitary lesions that&#xD;
      are symptomatic and require surgery. Patients will be followed with a series of endocrine&#xD;
      laboratory testing, physical examinations, testing of quality of life and neurocognitive&#xD;
      function before and serially over time either during non-surgical management or after surgery&#xD;
      and in some patients before and after radiotherapy (RT). Data on pituitary magnetic resonance&#xD;
      imaging (MRI) studies and visual field testing being done over time during follow up as part&#xD;
      of clinical care will be collected.&#xD;

      PROTOCOL I: Prospective Study of the outcome of conservative non-surgical management of&#xD;
      patients with asymptomatic, clinically non-functioning (CNF) pituitary lesions. This protocol&#xD;
      will evaluate prospectively the outcome of non-surgical management of clinically&#xD;
      non-functioning pituitary lesions that do not appear to need surgery as their initial&#xD;
      therapy. The overall design consists of an initial baseline evaluation and then serial&#xD;
      prospective follow up studies over time for up to 5 years of follow up. The study will&#xD;
      evaluate laboratory testing, clinical examinations, quality of life and neurocognitive&#xD;
      function in these patients. Data will be collected on visual fields and MRI studies of the&#xD;
      pituitary tumor that are done prospectively as part of clinical care to evaluate these&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PROTOCOL II : Prospective study of the outcome of patients with symptomatic, clinically&#xD;
      non-functioning pituitary tumors who are treated with transsphenoidal surgery and in some&#xD;
      cases also radiotherapy. This protocol will evaluate prospectively the outcome of surgical&#xD;
      management of asymptomatic clinically nonfunctioning pituitary lesions. The overall design&#xD;
      consists of an initial baseline evaluation and then serial prospective follow up studies over&#xD;
      time with up to 5 years of follow up. The study will evaluate laboratory testing, clinical&#xD;
      examinations, quality of life and neurocognitive function in these patients. Data will also&#xD;
      be collected on visual fields and MRI studies of the pituitary tumor that are done&#xD;
      prospectively as part of clinical care to evaluate these patients. Data will be analyzed to&#xD;
      determine the safety of observation alone following surgery for patients who do not have a&#xD;
      clinically significant tumor remnant, if the silent corticotroph tumor type is characterized&#xD;
      by elevated plasma levels of ACTH or its precursor, POMC, and if it is associated with an&#xD;
      increased tumor recurrence rate. A group of patients who are planning RT will also be studied&#xD;
      by these same procedures before and after RT in order to determine if the outcomes of&#xD;
      patients who receive RT for treatment of tumor re-growth to that of those who do not receive&#xD;
      RT with respect to further tumor growth, endocrine or neurological dysfunction. Quality of&#xD;
      life and neurocognitive function in patients with clinically non-functioning pituitary&#xD;
      lesions treated with surgery alone or those who also receive radiotherapy will be&#xD;
      prospectively assessed.&#xD;
