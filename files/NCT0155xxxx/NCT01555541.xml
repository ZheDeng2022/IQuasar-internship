  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical trial is to show that incorporating ofatumumab instead of rituximab&#xD;
      in combination with etoposide and cytarabine (OVA) is successful in collecting autologous&#xD;
      stem cells for use in an autologous stem cell transplantation (autoSCT) and to examine its&#xD;
      effectiveness in eliminating residual diffuse large B-Cell Lymphoma (DLBCL) in patients.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with relapsed Diffuse Large B-cell Lymphoma (DLBCL) who are refractory to or relapse&#xD;
      within 12 months of first-line rituximab-based therapy, have poor outcomes with conventional&#xD;
      approaches to autologous stem cell transplantation as detailed above. The investigators&#xD;
      hypothesize that the intensive mobilization strategy developed can overcome some of the&#xD;
      obstacles to successful autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) by both eliminating&#xD;
      residual disease following salvage therapy and by facilitating stem cell collection. Even&#xD;
      though there is clinical experience in the cooperative group setting with intensive pre-ASCT&#xD;
      mobilization, it has never been prospectively validated in DLBCL and concerns exist as to its&#xD;
      ability to improve outcomes with ASCT in this high-risk, and heavily pretreated group of&#xD;
      patients. Furthermore, most patients in the study site's registry treated with intensive&#xD;
      mobilization were rituximab-naïve and the findings may not translate in the&#xD;
      rituximab-refractory population. The investigators also believe that ofatumumab, a novel&#xD;
      monoclonal antibody against a distinct cluster of differentiation antigen 20 (CD20) epitope&#xD;
      may in fact overcome rituximab resistance in DLBCL patients and through more effective&#xD;
      complement dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) may eliminate minimal residual disease in the patient&#xD;
      and contaminating tumor cells in the stem cell graft.&#xD;
&#xD;
      General Design&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a single-institution, single-arm, prospective phase II study. Patients with high-risk&#xD;
      DLBCL (defined as either achieving less than complete remission (CR) to initial&#xD;
      rituximab-containing therapy or relapsing within 12 months of initial therapy) will be&#xD;
      enrolled on this study and will undergo staging prior to receiving intensive mobilization&#xD;
      with ofatumumab, etoposide, and high-dose ara-C (OVA). Following successful stem cell&#xD;
      collection, patients will proceed to standard autologous transplantation with&#xD;
      cyclophosphamide, 1,3-bis(2-chloroethyl)-1-nitrosourea (BCNU), and etoposide (CBV)&#xD;
      preparative regimen. Response evaluation will occur after salvage therapy, following&#xD;
      intensive mobilization therapy (d42), at day +90 after ASCT, and at 6, 12 and 24 months&#xD;
      thereafter. Event-free, progression-free, and overall survival will also be assessed until 48&#xD;
      months. The primary study endpoint is mobilization-adjusted complete metabolic response rate&#xD;
      (maCR) following OVA. Subjects who are not chemosensitive to salvage therapy (i.e. do not&#xD;
      achieve a partial response or complete response) will be re-evaluated after an additional&#xD;
      salvage regimen. If they are still not chemosensitive at this point, they will be withdrawn&#xD;
      from the study and replaced.&#xD;
