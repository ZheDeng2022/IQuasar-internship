      This randomized trial studies how well music therapy and parents' education work in improving&#xD;
      communication, emotional distress, and recovery in adolescents/young adult patients&#xD;
      undergoing treatment for high-risk cancer and their parents. Making a music therapy video may&#xD;
      improve communication, emotional distress, and recovery in younger patients undergoing&#xD;
      treatment for cancer. It is not yet known whether music therapy and counseling for parents is&#xD;
      more effective than information handouts for parents in improving communication and emotional&#xD;
      distress in patients undergoing treatment for cancer.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Compare the efficacy of a Therapeutic Music Video (TMV) intervention with a Therapeutic&#xD;
      Music Video plus Parent (TMV+P) intervention on outcomes for adolescents/young adults (AYA)&#xD;
      undergoing treatment for high-risk cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Compare the efficacy of a TMV intervention with a TMV+P intervention on outcomes for&#xD;
      parents of AYA with high-risk cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. Determine relationships of parent distress and parent perceived family environment with&#xD;
      AYA outcomes using a mixed methods approach. (exploratory)&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to age in years&#xD;
      (11-13 vs 14-17 vs 18-24). Parents are randomized to 1 of 2 intervention arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM I (TMV, low-dose parent): AYA patients undergo 60-minute sessions, delivered in a private&#xD;
      setting during outpatient clinic visits or hospitalizations, within a 6-8 weeks period with&#xD;
      board-certified music therapists. The music therapists help patients in brainstorming and&#xD;
      lyric writing, singing and creatively exploring how AYA lyrics and structure of the selected&#xD;
      music fit together, recording their song with a digital accompaniment track, completing video&#xD;
      layout worksheets (determining the contents of the video), taking and gathering photos or&#xD;
      making drawings for the video, and viewing clip art and pictures on a computer. The music&#xD;
      therapist then digitally formats, compiles, and transfers the AYA-developed music video to a&#xD;
      DVD. When completed, the therapist shares the video with the AYA and offers the option of&#xD;
      having a video &quot;premiere.&quot; AYAs who choose a premiere select a date and time for the viewing&#xD;
      and identify individuals they wish to attend (family, friends, healthcare professionals).&#xD;
      After the viewing, AYAs receive a copy of their DVD to keep. Parents' presence and&#xD;
      involvement during all sessions are directed by the AYAs. Parents receive 2 sessions over&#xD;
      15-60 minutes with a trained study team. During the first session, parents receive handouts&#xD;
      of helpful website resources that have specific information to help parents support their&#xD;
      AYAs. Team members also assure that parents know how to assess the sites. During the second&#xD;
      session, parents receive audio-recorded, telephone-based contact by a trained nurse who asks&#xD;
      them questions focusing on the content available on the provided website. The trained nurse&#xD;
      also answers any questions parents may have.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM II (AYA TMV +P): AYA patients receive intervention as patients in arm I. Parents receive&#xD;
      3 tailored 60-minute sessions with a trained nurse intervener. Sessions are recorded to make&#xD;
      sure study nurse delivers the sessions according to the study protocol. Study nurse provides&#xD;
      support information to parents using the Robb's Contextual Support Model, including Managing&#xD;
      the Chaos: Self Care as the First Step to Caring for Your AYA, Relationship Support: How to&#xD;
      Listen to and Encourage Your AYA to Talk; and Strategies for AYA Autonomy Support:&#xD;
      Understanding AYA's Ways of Coping. Session 3 content is also based on the Resilience in&#xD;
      Illness model. Sessions are also tailored to parents' needs, skills practice and/or role&#xD;
      playing, and reflection on and reinforcement of learning. Parents receive written materials&#xD;
      on tips and prescribed skills practice plans. AYA and parents complete questionnaires&#xD;
      including Illness-Related Distress, Defensive Coping, Spiritual Perspective, Social&#xD;
      Integration, Family Environment questionnaires, Hope-Derived Meaning, Self-Transcendence,&#xD;
      Positive Coping, Resilience, Parent Distress, and Quality of Life at baseline, at 2 weeks&#xD;
      after final session, and then at 90 days after final intervention session. Medical&#xD;
      background, intensity of treatment rating scale, and family demographics are also collected.&#xD;
