  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to investigate if intradermal (in the skin) basal and&#xD;
      bolus insulin delivery of a fast acting insulin analog (NovoRapid) as needed to adequately&#xD;
      control the blood glucose for a subject with Type 1 Diabetes can be maintained for a period&#xD;
      of up to three days and if intradermal delivery of insulin has advantages over standard&#xD;
      subcutaneous (under the skin) delivery.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The is a single center, open-label, 2 period crossover study randomized by route (intradermal&#xD;
      versus subcutaneous) in patients with Type 1 diabetes. Subjects will receive their insulin,&#xD;
      basal and bolus dosages, via intradermal (ID) and subcutaneous (SC) infusion sets over a&#xD;
      three day period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each subject will participate in 3 visits: a Screening Visit (V1), followed by 2 experimental&#xD;
      intervention days (V2 and V3) to be started 2 - 21 days after screening visit. The&#xD;
      minimum/maximum interval between study days shall be 5 to 28 days. Each subject will remain&#xD;
      in the clinic for approximately 3 days during the experimental interventions. A final exam&#xD;
      will be performed at the end of Visit 3.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After successful screening and enrollment subjects are admitted to the clinic. Their insulin&#xD;
      pump and infusion set is replaced by the investigational system, a commercially available&#xD;
      insulin pump and either the intradermal infusion set (Research Catheter Set, BD) or the&#xD;
      subcutaneous infusion set (Quick Set, Medtronic)to include an in-line pressure&#xD;
      transducer/recorder and insulin NovoRapid. The initial pump infusion rate is established&#xD;
      based on the patient's known basal infusion rate and the meal bolus insulin is estimated&#xD;
      based on the patient's known insulin sensitivity. An intravenous (in the vein) catheter line&#xD;
      is established, blood glucose is measured at least every 2 hours overnight and insulin&#xD;
      corrections can be implemented, if deemed necessary. The overnight and pre-prandial (before&#xD;
      meal) target range is 70-160 mg/dl, although the procedure will continue as planned if the&#xD;
      patient is outside the range. It should be the goal not to give any IV glucose or insulin at&#xD;
      all, and not to change basal insulin settings for at least 2 hours before the meal. The&#xD;
      breakfast meal will be a high GI (60g carbohydrates) solid meal, to be consumed within 15&#xD;
      minutes and followed for a period of 6 hours of blood sampling for glucose and insulin&#xD;
      levels. Lunch will be served as standardized mixed meal, and followed for a period of 4-6&#xD;
      hours. This procedure is repeated on days 2 and 3 whereas the breakfast and lunch meal as&#xD;
      well as the insulin dose to cover the meal are the same. A light evening dinner is served&#xD;
      every day, composition and insulin dose to be recorded. On day three after the 4 hour period&#xD;
      following lunch the catheter will be removed, catheter and site assessments will be&#xD;
      documented and an ultrasound observation of the infusion site (skin thickness and SC) versus&#xD;
      an adjacent control site will be performed within 10 min after removal of the infusion set.&#xD;
      Glucose rescue, if necessary, will be administered orally (juice, 200 mL). Insulin correction&#xD;
      boli should be delivered via the investigational infusion set.&#xD;
