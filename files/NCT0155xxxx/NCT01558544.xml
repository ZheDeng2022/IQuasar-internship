  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study hopes to contribute to the development of technologies of ovarian tissue&#xD;
      freezing-thawing and in vitro maturation of immature eggs such that a person at risk for&#xD;
      premature ovarian failure might be able to conceive a genetically related child.&#xD;

      Procedure: The patient will undergo preoperative sonographic assessment of both ovaries to&#xD;
      determine if either ovary is diseased or compromised. Patient will undergo preoperative blood&#xD;
      sampling to measure AMH, FSH, LH and estradiol as indicators of current ovarian function&#xD;
      (less than 8 teaspoons) if time allows and assessment of ovarian reserve is appropriate;&#xD;
      menopausal levels of FSH (â‰¥ 30 miu/ml) will be a contraindication to participation in this&#xD;
      study. The patient may have infectious disease testing as part of the evaluation for&#xD;
      fertility preservation treatment. Patient will undergo preoperative assessment and clearance&#xD;
      for surgery by an anesthesiologist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intraoperative management will include laparotomy or laparoscopy, depending on the individual&#xD;
      patient's history, exam and oncology plans. Removal of one or both ovaries will depend on&#xD;
      preoperative ovarian assessment and recommendation of the oncologist. If ovarian survival for&#xD;
      the anticipated treatment has never been documented then both ovaries will be removed. Both&#xD;
      ovaries may also be removed if diseased or if the condition requires prophylactic&#xD;
      oophorectomy to prevent risk of malignant transformation, e.g. 46 XX/46 XY chimera and BRCA&#xD;
      mutation carriers. If ovarian function has rarely been documented for the anticipated&#xD;
      treatment then one ovary will be removed and one may be left in situ or repositioned to avoid&#xD;
      the field of radiation. The decision to leave the ovary in situ or to reposition will be made&#xD;
      pre-operatively by the physician performing the surgery in consultation with the patient and&#xD;
      the radiation oncologist. If there is no normal ovarian tissue, as determined by pathology,&#xD;
      we will take biopsies of ovarian tissue not to exceed 50% of the ovarian volume from the&#xD;
      contra-lateral side for freezing. Additionally, the remaining ovary may be repositioned and&#xD;
      sutured to the posterior wall of the uterus or above the pelvic brim with a radio-opaque clip&#xD;
      placed to identify this ovary for shielding during irradiation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ovarian tissue will be removed and treated as follows: (a) the cortex will be stripped from&#xD;
      the remaining ovarian tissue as this outer layer contains most of the immature eggs or&#xD;
      primordial follicles. The cortex will be sectioned into 8mm x 1mm strips, each to be frozen&#xD;
      in vials containing 1-3 strips. One strip will be sent to pathology for paraffin embedding to&#xD;
      be available for future assessment of occult lymphoma cells markers; (b) the central or&#xD;
      medullary portion will be frozen separately for potential scientific analysis since this&#xD;
      section would not be of any clinical utility. The amount of tissue frozen may vary depending&#xD;
      in part by whether one or two ovaries are removed. At some point in the future, thawing of&#xD;
      ovarian tissue, with either in vitro maturation or autologous transplantation into the pelvis&#xD;
      or other area of the body could be performed. The patient would receive routine postoperative&#xD;
      care. The patient's oncologist will be consulted regarding proper timing of the surgery and&#xD;
      the need for any special intraoperative or postoperative management&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, since the survival of the primordial follicles in transplanted ovarian tissue is&#xD;
      quite low (&lt;10%), methods for in vivo maturation of these eggs and improved methods of&#xD;
      transplantation need to be developed. One or two vials of tissue (&lt;10% of all tissue frozen)&#xD;
      will be thawed to develop the techniques of maturing oocytes. This may include&#xD;
      transplantation of the tissue into an animal model for in vivo maturation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Six months to 1 year following surgery and/or treatment for the medical condition, eg&#xD;
      chemotherapy, hormone testing will be performed for evaluation of ovarian reserve. This may&#xD;
      include AMH and FSH hormone levels as well as pelvic ultrasounds and dominant antra follicle&#xD;
      count.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the subject does not wish to utilize the ovarian tissue for her own clinical use, the&#xD;
      options include discarding the cryopreserved ovarian tissue or donating the cryopreserved&#xD;
      tissue for approved research studies.&#xD;
