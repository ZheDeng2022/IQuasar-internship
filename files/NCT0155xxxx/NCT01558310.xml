    <textblock>
      This is a single site, randomized, placebo-controlled, cross-over trial of sub-cutaneous&#xD;
      injections of placebo and Stelara™ (ustekinumab) in subjects with scalp psoriasis.The purpose&#xD;
      of the study is to assess the effectiveness of Stelara™ (ustekinumab)in the treatment of&#xD;
      scalp psoriasis by determining the proportion of subjects who clear or almost clear in scalp&#xD;
      specific physician assessments. The study will include approximately 30 subjects.&#xD;
