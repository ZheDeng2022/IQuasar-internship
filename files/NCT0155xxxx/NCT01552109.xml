&#xD;
        4. Subject has new onset angina with symptoms less than one month&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Describe the demographic and medical profile of subjects diagnosed with stable angina by&#xD;
           non-interventional consulting physicians in India&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Describe the diagnostic pathway prescribed by non-interventional consulting physicians&#xD;
           and adopted by stable angina subjects in India&#xD;
