      There is an increasing trend in the society for developing obesity, type 2 diabetes and&#xD;
      cardiovascular diseases. It is therefore important to identify the risk factors behind this&#xD;
      tendency. Recent studies have shown that exposure to high blood sugar levels in pregnancy (as&#xD;
      in mothers with type 1 diabetes) may play a role in the development of obesity, type 2&#xD;
      diabetes and cardiovascular diseases later in life for the children. Some studies suggest&#xD;
      that high blood sugar levels during pregnancy can also affects cognitive function as well as&#xD;
      growth and development of puberty. The mechanisms behind this are not sufficiently clarified&#xD;
      yet.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the period 1993-1999, pregnant women with type 1 diabetes in Denmark were followed and&#xD;
      information about the course of pregnancy was collected, including the long-term blood sugar&#xD;
      level during pregnancy and the children's' condition at birth. The unique opportunities in&#xD;
      Denmark to identify and follow the children of these mothers and the possibility to select a&#xD;
      comparison group of children of non-diabetic mothers gives a unique opportunity to examine&#xD;
      the children of mothers with type 1 diabetes and accurately investigate the effect of blood&#xD;
      sugar levels in pregnancy on conditions later in life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There has not previously been made any study of this size and it is the investigators hope to&#xD;
      be able to quantify the effect of blood sugar level during pregnancy on outcomes later in&#xD;
      life. This will potentially give the possibility to detect individuals at risk for&#xD;
      cardiovascular diseases earlier and to improve prevention targets in children of mothers with&#xD;
      diabetes.&#xD;

      Introduction&#xD;
&#xD;
      Health conditions result from a combination of genetic susceptibility and environmental&#xD;
      influences. While the genotype is determined at conception the phenotype is modulated and&#xD;
      influenced by environmental and epigenetic factors throughout life, not only postnatally but&#xD;
      already in uteri and possibly even at preimplantation stages.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recent studies have highlighted the possible role of intrauterine exposure to maternal&#xD;
      diabetes in the pathogenesis of overweight, type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease. A&#xD;
      hyperglycaemic intrauterine environment may also affect cognitive function, childhood growth&#xD;
      and pubertal development in the offspring. During 1993-99 all pregnancies in women with&#xD;
      pre-gestational type 1 diabetes were prospectively reported to a national registry in the&#xD;
      Danish Diabetes Association. This nationwide registry contain detailed information of&#xD;
      maternal demography, pregnancy outcome and diabetes status including glycated haemoglobin&#xD;
      (HbA1c) in a prospective cohort of 900 women and their newborn offspring. These data are&#xD;
      therefore ideal for a large-scale study on long-term effects of a diabetic intrauterine&#xD;
      environment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study consists of 3 substudies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aims&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study I&#xD;
&#xD;
      To study long-term effects of a diabetic intrauterine environment in offspring of women with&#xD;
      type 1 diabetes compared to matched controls from the background population with respect to:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cognitive function&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pubertal development&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Diabetes/pre-diabetes&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Overweight&#xD;
&#xD;
      B) To study if HbA1c-level in pregnancy is an independent predictor of these outcomes within&#xD;
      the study group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study II&#xD;
&#xD;
      To study differences in offspring of women with type 1 diabetes compared to offspring from&#xD;
      the background population with respect to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  morbidity and congenital malformations&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  medical treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  mortality&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study III&#xD;
&#xD;
      To study differences in offspring of women with type 1 diabetes compared to compared to&#xD;
      matched controls from the background population without a family history of diabetes with&#xD;
      respect to:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A) State-of-the-art metabolic characterization using euglycemic-hyperinsulinemic clamp&#xD;
&#xD;
      B) DNA methylation, RNA transcription and protein quantification in muscle and adipose-tissue&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is a prospective follow-up study. The study group includes the offspring of women&#xD;
      with type 1 diabetes from the national diabetes birth registry (1993-99, n=900) with&#xD;
      information of HbA1c prior to conception and/or 1st trimester HbA1c and a control group&#xD;
      including offspring of women without diabetes who delivered during the same period matched&#xD;
      with respect to gender and age of offspring and the family's postcode as an indirect marker&#xD;
      of the socioeconomic background.&#xD;

      match 100 controls, resulting in n=90,000 controls aged 12-18 years) A register-based study&#xD;
      will be performed to determine the effect of intrauterine hyperglycaemia on congenital&#xD;
      malformations, morbidity and mortality in childhood.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population In the cohort of 900 children from the national diabetes birth cohort, we&#xD;
      will study all subjects utilizing register data concerning morbidity, mortality and use of&#xD;
      prescription medicine. For every diabetes-exposed person Statistics Denmark will identify 100&#xD;
      age, sex and calendar-time matched controls from the background population from the Central&#xD;
      Person Register (Statistics Denmark).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Morbidity and mortality - Operational strategy&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. In the National Registry of Patients (NRP) and the National Cancer Registry all&#xD;
           diagnoses from identified diabetes-exposed and controls will be identified.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. In the National Drug Prescription Database all information concerning prescription drugs&#xD;
           on identified diabetes-exposed and controls will be identified.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. In the National Registry of Death all diagnoses from identified diabetes-exposed and&#xD;
           controls will be identified.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Endpoints Morbidity: diabetes-exposed vs. controls from the background population Medical&#xD;
      treatment: diabetes-exposed vs. controls from the background population Mortality:&#xD;
      diabetes-exposed vs. controls from the background population&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistics Incidence rates will be calculated as new cases per 100.000 per year and analyzed&#xD;
      by Poisson regression. Via Statistics Denmark controls will be identified and matched&#xD;
      appropriately.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Morbidity and mortality will be analyzed by the Kaplan-Meier statistic, with log-rank test&#xD;
      and Cox regression with relevant covariates.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study III: Sub-study (n=50 diabetes-exposed and n=50 un-exposed controls aged 18-19 years)&#xD;
      Offspring of mothers with type 1 diabetes, born before 1 January 1994 (over 18 years of age&#xD;
      at the date of invitation), and who participated in the study A will be invited to&#xD;
      participate in study B. Study B is anticipated to involve approximately 50 diabetes-exposed&#xD;
      and approximately 50 un-exposed controls 18 - 19 years of age at time of examination. The&#xD;
      study groups will be matched according to BMI, gender, date of birth and level of physical&#xD;
      activity. All participants should be drug-naive and healthy with a BMI between 20 and 30, and&#xD;
      controls should have no family history of diabetes. Since all participants will be over the&#xD;
      age of 18, they will be able to provide informed written consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Any unknown disease or need for medication that occurs after inclusion,&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Abnormal ECG, screening blood tests and/or severe hypertension, and&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Impaired glucose tolerance in non-diabetic subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The selected subgroup of offspring of mothers with type 1 diabetes and matched controls will&#xD;
      be investigated by state-of-the-art metabolic characterization using&#xD;
      euglycemic-hyperinsulinemic clamp with tracer glucose combined with indirect calorimetry&#xD;
      allowing reliable estimates of whole-body glucose disposal rates, endogenous glucose&#xD;
      production and glucose and lipid oxidation. Moreover assessment of physical activity level&#xD;
      using the IPAQ-questionnaire will be complemented by studies of maximal oxygen consumption&#xD;
      (VO2max). During the clamp studies, tissue biopsies from subcutaneous abdominal fat and thigh&#xD;
      muscle (m. vastus lateralis) will be obtained for studies of potential long-term molecular&#xD;
      consequences of intrauterine exposure to hyperglycemia - metabolic memory of birth. This will&#xD;
      include application of several discovery-mode (hypothesis free), global approaches such as&#xD;
      transcriptional profiling using microarray-based technologies, quantitative proteomics,&#xD;
      bioinformatics including pathway analysis and subsequent validation of observed abnormalities&#xD;
      using qRT-PCR, immunoblotting and other more classical protein technologies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Examinations:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physical activity (Day 1)&#xD;
&#xD;
      The children and their parents will be asked to fill in a questionnaire addressing&#xD;
      psychosocial and demographic aspects and self-reported physical activity&#xD;
      (IPAQ-questionnaire). VO2-max is determined by a graded maximal test (VO2-peak) on a cycle&#xD;
      ergometer using indirect calorimetry.&#xD;
&#xD;
      State-of-the-art metabolic characterization (Day 2):&#xD;
&#xD;
      Euglycemic-hyperinsulinemic clamp Subjects are admitted after a 12-h overnight fast to the&#xD;
      centre at Odense University Hospital. They are instructed to consume a standardized diet, and&#xD;
      to refrain from physical activity for 48-h before the experiments. The study subjects are&#xD;
      examined by a euglycemic-hyperinsulinemic clamp (insulin 40mU/min/m2 for 4-h) using tracer&#xD;
      technology as described55. The studies are combined with indirect calorimetry allowing&#xD;
      estimates of glucose disposal rates, endogenous glucose production, glucose and lipid&#xD;
      oxidation, and non-oxidative glucose metabolism as described. Blood samples are drawn every&#xD;
      20 min during the clamp for assessment of plasma glucose, FFA, adipokines, and serum insulin&#xD;
      and C-peptide. During the basal and insulin-stimulated states, tissue biopsies are taken from&#xD;
      m. vastus lateralis and subcutaneous abdominal fat using a modified Bergstrom needle with&#xD;
      suction under local anesthesia. Each biopsy is rapidly frozen in liquid nitrogen within 30 s&#xD;
      and stored at -130°C for later analysis as described below. Body fat (%) is determined by the&#xD;
      bioimpedance method.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Transcriptomics and proteomic analysis of skeletal muscle and adipose tissue include:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Microarray-based transcriptional profiling and biological pathway analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Discovery-mode quantitative proteomics of tissue biopsies:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Targeted quantitative proteomics:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Quantitative RT-PCR&#xD;
&#xD;
      Immunoblotting&#xD;
&#xD;
      Genetic analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis of DNA methylation&#xD;
&#xD;
      Whole genome methylation analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methylation-Sensitive High Resolution Melting analysis (MS-HRM)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Gene Expression Analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sequencing&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis Mann-Whitney U test will be used to assess for each CpG, whether two&#xD;
      groups had the same distribution of methylation. To eliminate probes that did not work and&#xD;
      other diverging values, beta values in each group will be trimmed for extremes prior to the&#xD;
      calculation of the average beta value. Next, only genes with the highest 5% tail of the&#xD;
      absolute average beta value differences between the two groups will be selected. Thus CpGs&#xD;
      with a p-value below 0.005 and with the highest beta value differences between the two groups&#xD;
      will be used for identification of genes with statistically significant diabetes-specific&#xD;
      changes in methylation. Comparison of array methylation results with MS-HRM results will be&#xD;
      performed with a Mann-Whitney U test and a Chi2 test for trend. Spearman coefficients will be&#xD;
      calculated to assess the correlation between methylation and gene expression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Novelty and importance&#xD;
&#xD;
      The rapidly increasing burden of overweight and cardiovascular disease is becoming a threat&#xD;
      to both the individual and global economy. It is therefore essential to identify risk groups&#xD;
      to target preventive strategies. Exposure to intrauterine hyperglycemia contributes to the&#xD;
      epidemic through a vicious-cycle passing increased susceptibility on to the next generation&#xD;
      via pathways that are only sparsely understood.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study includes a very large cohort of diabetes-exposed offspring of well-characterized&#xD;
      prospectively studied women with type 1 diabetes. It includes information on maternal&#xD;
      glycemia during pregnancy, which is imperative to assess possible associations with estimates&#xD;
      of offspring metabolism and cognitive function. The register-based study is unique and&#xD;
      enables collection of information on morbidity and mortality in the whole cohort. The&#xD;
      specific molecular signature of intrauterine exposure to hyperglycemia in human tissues has&#xD;
      to our knowledge not been examined before, and although the above-mentioned studies suggest&#xD;
      the possible involvement of certain pathways in skeletal muscle and adipose tissue, it is&#xD;
      important to investigate the metabolic memory of birth using hypothesis-free, discovery-mode&#xD;
      global approaches to discover potential perturbations in both expected and unexpected&#xD;
      pathways.&#xD;
