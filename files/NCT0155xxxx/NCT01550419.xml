  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) is an important cause of morbidity and mortality in&#xD;
      ventilated critically ill patients specially in intensive care unit (ICU). It is associated&#xD;
      with an increased duration of mechanical ventilation, high death rates and increased&#xD;
      healthcare costs in China. However, VAP is preventable and many practices have been&#xD;
      demonstrated to reduce the incidence of this disease, but the morbidity is still so high. So&#xD;
      much more methods of prevention should be needed to reduce the incidence of VAP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statins (3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors) present&#xD;
      anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory effects besides their ability to regulate cholesterol&#xD;
      composition. So it is hypothesized that early use of statin may prevent some of the infection&#xD;
      disease such as VAP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Actually, Two studies have showed that statin treatment is associated with reduced risk of&#xD;
      pneumonia. However, the relationship between statins and reduced risk of pneumonia is not&#xD;
      consistent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After reviewing some of the guidelines,meta analyses and system reviews, the investigator&#xD;
      find that advanced age,immune suppression from disease or medication and specially depressed&#xD;
      level of consciousness are the risk factors of VAP. So the investigator assumes that early&#xD;
      use of statin may give us a favorable outcome in the patients with coma or in the patients&#xD;
      with severe disease (Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score &gt; 15 or Glasgow&#xD;
      coma score &lt; 7).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition there is no prospective study to investigate the role of statins in VAP in the&#xD;
      patients with ischemic stroke. The investigator hopes that this study can approve the&#xD;
      relationship between statins and reduced risk of VAP in the patients with ischemic stroke.&#xD;
      And it can improve the processes,outcomes and costs of critical care as well.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a one-center, two-arm, randomized, single-blinded, controlled trial. When a patient&#xD;
      with ischemic stroke who needs mechanic ventilation is admitted to ICU,a sealed envelop will&#xD;
      be opened which decide whether the patient is assigned to the placebo arm or the atorvastatin&#xD;
      arm. During they stay in ICU, one tablet of atorvastatin (40mg) or one tablet of placebo will&#xD;
      be administered. Atorvastatin or placebo will be administered through an enteral feeding tube&#xD;
      or administered orally when patients are able to safely take oral medications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VAP diagnosis accords with the comprehensive evidence-based clinical practice guidelines for&#xD;
      ventilator-associated pneumonia:Diagnosis and treatment which was published in 2008.&#xD;
