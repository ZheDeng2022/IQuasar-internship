      Influence of Tourniquet Use and Surgery Duration on the Incidence of Deep Vein Thrombosis in&#xD;
      Total Knee Arthroplasty&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tourniquet, Surgery Duration and DVT in TKA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Abstract:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: The occurrence of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) was evaluated in 78 patients&#xD;
      submitted to total knee arthroplasty (TKA), followed by ascending venography (AV), between&#xD;
      the seventh and twelfth days postoperative.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: Patients received prophylaxis with oral anticoagulation for 12 days, maintaining INR&#xD;
      at around 2.5.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Results: Results showed 45 cases (57.7%) of negative bilateral AV and 33 (42.3%) cases of&#xD;
      positivity for DVT. Thirteen cases were of the proximal type DVT, making up 16.7% of the&#xD;
      total. We compared the groups with and without DVT, and another which considered only cases&#xD;
      with proximal DVT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Conclusion: The statistical analysis didn't reveal significance in relation to tourniquet&#xD;
      time, despite the higher likelihood of proximal DVT after 90 minutes (p=0.08) and surgery&#xD;
      duration of more than 120 minutes increases its risk.&#xD;

&#xD;
      Introduction Total knee arthroplasties (TKAs), together with total hip arthroplasties, are&#xD;
      frequently the object of study regarding deep vein thrombosis (DVT) (1); however, DVT also&#xD;
      commonly occurs in other knee procedures (2). Despite the importance of this problem and the&#xD;
      interest in it, most researchers studying DVT generally focus on prophylaxis for prevention;&#xD;
      surprisingly, there have been few studies of the isolated risk factors for DVT associated&#xD;
      with TKA. Although there is some controversy about the role of TKA alone as a risk factor for&#xD;
      DVT (3-7), some researchers believe that bone manipulation, reaming of the medullary canal,&#xD;
      and the duration of the different procedures are relevant risk factors for DVT (8,9). Another&#xD;
      important and controversial factor related to TKA is the use of surgical tourniquets.&#xD;
      Although all these factors are mentioned in the literature, surgery duration as an isolated&#xD;
      risk factor for DVT in TKA has received little attention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We used ascending venography (AV) to evaluate the association between the use of tourniquets&#xD;
      and total procedure duration and the occurrence of DVT during TKA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients and Methods Seventy-eight consecutive patients from our institution underwent&#xD;
      cemented TKA for degenerative knee disorders and then underwent AV, for which they gave&#xD;
      informed consent, at a point between 7 and 12 days after surgery, after having been&#xD;
      discharged from the hospital. Of the 78, 78.2% were women and 21.8% were men, with an average&#xD;
      age of 65.1 years (range, 31-88 years; SD, 11.5 years). Osteoarthrosis was the diagnosis in&#xD;
      74.4%, rheumatoid arthritis in 21.8%, and other disorders in 3.8%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients received prophylaxis for DVT with oral anticoagulants for 12 days, with an&#xD;
      international normalized ratio being maintained at about 2.5 (range, 2.0-3.0) in all cases.&#xD;
      Perioperatively, we recorded total pneumatic tourniquet time and total surgery duration, in&#xD;
      minutes. In all cases, the use of a tourniquet was interrupted by hemostasis, after&#xD;
      cementation of the implant and before wound closure. Five categories were established for&#xD;
      total tourniquet time: &lt;60, 61 to 90, 91 to 120, and &gt;120 minutes. The total procedure&#xD;
      duration was defined in the same way; we recorded the times of the initial incision and the&#xD;
      last suture stitch made to close the incision. Three categories were defined for procedure&#xD;
      duration: &lt;120, 121 to 150, and &gt;150 minutes. Only 2 patients (3.1%) were given a general&#xD;
      anesthetic; all the others were given a spinal block.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study end point was defined as the execution of bilateral AV at a point between 7 and 12&#xD;
      days after surgery, after hospital discharge. The AV was carried out by a specialist in&#xD;
      vascular radiology. The technique applied was basically that described by Rabinov and Paulin&#xD;
      (10). The presence of clinically manifested DVT and/or pulmonary embolism was also taken in&#xD;
      to consideration. The clinical manifestations of DVT were greater edema of the lower limb&#xD;
      than would be expected for the procedure, associated with intense pain on palpation of the&#xD;
      calf and pain on passive dorsiflexion of the foot.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AV findings were considered positive for DVT in the presence of blood clots in the vein&#xD;
      lumens (Figure 1). They were characterized as occurring on the operated side, contralateral&#xD;
      or bilateral, and were diagnosed as proximal DVT (more severe) or distal DVT (less severe),&#xD;
      depending on the contents of the radiologist's report.&#xD;
