      Chronic Chagas cardiomyopathy causes substantial morbidity and mortality in Latin America.&#xD;
      Whether RAS inhibitors and beta-blockers are safe and beneficial has been challenged because&#xD;
      of the lack of formal trials. Hence, the objective of this study was to determine the safety&#xD;
      and efficacy of renin-angiotensin system (RAS) inhibitors and beta-blockers in chronic Chagas&#xD;
      cardiomyopathy. This way, the investigators conducted a double-blind, placebo-controlled, and&#xD;
      randomized trial in 42 patients with Trypanosoma cruzi infection and cardiomyopathy. All&#xD;
      patients received enalapril (up-titrated to 20 mg BID) and spironolactone (25 mg QD).&#xD;
      Subsequently, the patients were randomly assigned to receive placebo (n = 20) or carvedilol&#xD;
      up-titrated to 25 mg BID (n = 19). The primary end points were change in left ventricular&#xD;
      ejection fraction (LVEF) after RAS inhibition and that after the addition of carvedilol. The&#xD;
      secondary end points were changes in other echocardiographic parameters, Framingham score,&#xD;
      quality of life (36-item Short-Form Health Survey), New York Heart Association class,&#xD;
      radiographic indices, brain natriuretic peptide levels, and chemokines as well as safety end&#xD;
      points.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Chronic Chagas cardiomyopathy (CCC) is an important cause of heart failure (HF) and sudden&#xD;
      death in Latin America.1 According to recent estimates, 13 million people worldwide are&#xD;
      infected with Trypanosoma cruzi, of whom 3.0 to 3.3 million are symptomatic.2 The incidence&#xD;
      rate is 200000 cases per year. Among those infected, 30% have clinical features of CCC and&#xD;
      15% ultimately develop overt left ventricular (LV) insufficiency-the main prognostic&#xD;
      determinant of the disease. In Chagas cardiomyopathy, the hemodynamic and neurohormonal&#xD;
      responses do not differ from those in other cardiomyopathies. This common pathophysiology&#xD;
      suggests that treatments shown to be effective by classic HF trials should be beneficial in&#xD;
      CCC. However, CCC has several specific characteristics, such as early cardiac denervation,&#xD;
      frequent ventricular arrhythmias, and several forms as well as grades of conduction&#xD;
      disturbances, including sinus bradycardia, complete atrioventricular block, and right&#xD;
      bundle-branch block. Morphologically, hypertrophy, dilatation, and severe fibrosis are&#xD;
      prominent. In 20% to 40% of cases, an apical ventricular aneurysm is present.1 These&#xD;
      peculiarities in combination lead to a high incidence of sudden death (60% of all deaths),&#xD;
      cardiac insufficiency, and ventricular remodeling. The responses of patients to the usual&#xD;
      drugs prescribed in HF could be different, and this perception has led to the suboptimal&#xD;
      dosing or lack of initiation of medical treatments that are of proven efficacy in patients&#xD;
      with other etiologies of HF. The underlying problem is that therapies that are effective in&#xD;
      patients with HF caused by non-chagasic cardiomyopathies, such as those with&#xD;
      renin-angiotensin system inhibitors (RASis) and h-blockers, have yet to be formally tested in&#xD;
      CCC. There are few clinical trials and no randomized study on this subject. Consequently, the&#xD;
      investigators evaluated the effects of optimizing treatment with enalapril and spironolactone&#xD;
      and then undertook a randomized trial of adding a h-blocker in the treatment of patients with&#xD;
      CCC.&#xD;
