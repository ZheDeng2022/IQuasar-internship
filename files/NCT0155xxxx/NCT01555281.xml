  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is a great need for treatment options in patients with multiple myeloma (MM) after&#xD;
      failure of the lenalidomide/dexamethasone regimen as there is no established standard active&#xD;
      therapy for these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Combining nelfinavir, a drug targeting both the proteasome and PI3K/Akt pathway, with&#xD;
      lenalidomide, may restore lenalidomide-sensitivity to the disease as has been shown in vivo&#xD;
      for the PI3K/Akt inhibitor perifosine and the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients expected to be included in the trial are heavily pretreated and might not be&#xD;
      candidates for further intensive therapies. The combination of nelfinavir with&#xD;
      lenalidomide/dexamethasone offers also to these patients an alternative. Preliminary&#xD;
      experiences in another SAKK trial with the combination of bortezomib and nelfinavir are&#xD;
      positive with few side effects with nelfinavir doses of up to 1875 mg twice daily (bid). For&#xD;
      the phase I part of the trial a starting dose of 1250 mg nelfinavir bid was chosen, since the&#xD;
      necessary plasma concentration of nelfinavir will not be reached with lower doses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In case of progression during or after the trial treatment any other lenalidomide- or&#xD;
      bortezomib-based chemotherapy combination could be an option for the patient. However, the&#xD;
      addition of a chemotherapeutic drug like cyclophosphamide or doxorubicin has known side&#xD;
      effects like hematological toxicities, nausea, vomiting and hair loss.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this trial is to demonstrate that the combination of nelfinavir with&#xD;
      lenalidomide/dexamethasone is safe (phase I, dose escalation of nelfinavir) and active (phase&#xD;
      II). Patients who do not respond to trial medication will stop trial treatment after 4 months&#xD;
      of therapy at the latest.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the combination of nelfinavir with lenalidomide/dexamethasone should prove to be safe and&#xD;
      efficient in treatment of lenalidomide-refractory MM, this would be the first orally&#xD;
      available treatment for these patients and establish a new class of drugs (human&#xD;
      immunodeficiency virus (HIV) protease inhibitors) as active antineoplastic agents in MM. In&#xD;
      addition this would establish the concept of &quot;re-sensitizing&quot; patients to lenalidomide&#xD;
      therapy and demonstrate the effect of nelfinavir on proteasomal degradation and Akt&#xD;
      phosphorylation in cancer patients in vivo.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Disease background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      MM is a plasma cell tumor. It accounted for an estimated 20,180 new cases of cancer and&#xD;
      11,170 deaths in the United States in 2010. With a prevalence of 23 per 100,000 people, MM is&#xD;
      an orphan disease (prevalence &lt;5:10,000). The median age at diagnosis is 60-65 years.&#xD;
      Although MM remains incurable, unprecedented gains in survival outcomes have been achieved in&#xD;
      the last three decades. Survival has been improved mainly in younger patients below the age&#xD;
      of 65 with the advent of high-dose melphalan therapy followed by autologous stem cell&#xD;
      transplantation (ASCT). In the last 10 years the introduction of novel therapies, such as&#xD;
      thalidomide, lenalidomide and bortezomib have further improved overall survival. However, all&#xD;
      patients ultimately relapse and will require salvage therapies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therapy background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main decision criterion for first-line treatment selection is the patient's eligibility&#xD;
      for high-dose chemotherapy with melphalan and subsequent ASCT. Patients who are not eligible&#xD;
      for this treatment, due to advanced age, comorbidities or poor performance status, are&#xD;
      routinely treated with a combination of melphalan, prednisone and a novel agent such as&#xD;
      thalidomide, bortezomib or lenalidomide. Currently, patients will relapse from their first&#xD;
      line of therapy at a median of 2-3 years from diagnosis. Achieving a near complete remission&#xD;
      and maintaining the residual tumor mass under control is considered as the mainstay in&#xD;
      current treatment of MM.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment of relapsed/refractory myeloma is based on double or triple combinations with a&#xD;
      novel agent such as lenalidomide or bortezomib with dexamethasone and/or cytotoxic drugs such&#xD;
      as alkylators and anthracyclines. The choice of a regimen at relapse depends on the frontline&#xD;
      therapy as well as disease- or therapy-related comorbidities. Although patients can achieve&#xD;
      long lasting remissions with the novel agents MM remains a chronic disease. Patients will&#xD;
      invariably relapse or become refractory to second and later line treatments. Therefore new&#xD;
      treatment options for late-line patients are required.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The combination of lenalidomide and bortezomib has been reported to show activity in a subset&#xD;
      of lenalidomide and bortezomib double-refractory patients in a phase I/II trial and very&#xD;
      recent retrospective data suggest that bortezomib containing regimens may be active in&#xD;
      lenalidomide-refractory myeloma patients. There are no approved treatment options for&#xD;
      lenalidomide and bortezomib double-refractory patients. Possible therapeutic alternatives&#xD;
      such as carfilzomib and pomalidomide are still in clinical development and to date no&#xD;
      clinical trials are open in Switzerland. Therefore, treatment options for&#xD;
      lenalidomide-refractory patients remain very limited.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preclinical results in the NCI60 cancer cell line panel show that HIV protease inhibitors&#xD;
      such as nelfinavir exhibit a wide spectrum of antitumor activity. They inhibit the&#xD;
      proliferation of 60 cancer cell lines derived from nine different tumor types. This is&#xD;
      consistent with previous reports demonstrating that HIV protease inhibitors are effective in&#xD;
      other diseases like MM and Kaposi sarcoma. Nelfinavir induces cell cycle arrest and apoptosis&#xD;
      in tumor cells through inhibition of proteasomal degradation and the PI3K/Akt pathway.&#xD;
      Therefore preclinical evidence underscores the proteasome inhibiting activity of nelfinavir.&#xD;
      Modulation of proteasome function is a rational approach to overcome chemo-resistance and&#xD;
      achieve chemo-sensitization, suggesting that the addition of such an agent to myeloma&#xD;
      standard treatment could restore sensitivity to the standard therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pharmacologic intervention with the PI3K/Akt pathway induced cell death in MM cell lines and&#xD;
      primary tumor samples. Inhibition of Akt phosphorylation by perifosine has shown significant&#xD;
      clinical activity and manageable toxicity in patients with relapsed/refractory MM in&#xD;
      combination with dexamethasone alone (≥MR (minor response) of 38%; SD (stable disease) of&#xD;
      47%), or together with both lenalidomide and dexamethasone (≥PR (partial response) of 50%, MR&#xD;
      of 20%). These data suggest an important role of the Akt pathway for malignant growth and&#xD;
      survival of MM cells also in vivo. The addition of nelfinavir to standard&#xD;
      lenalidomide/dexamethasone treatment in lenalidomide-refractory patients is expected to&#xD;
      restore sensitivity of the myeloma cells to lenalidomide, acting via inhibition of the&#xD;
      PI3K/Akt pathway and modulation of proteasome function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim of this study is to demonstrate the safety and activity of combining lenalidomide and&#xD;
      dexamethasone with nelfinavir in patients with progressive MM that have failed&#xD;
      lenalidomide-containing therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment Nelfinavir:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nelfinavir mesylate (Viracept) is an inhibitor of the HIV protease 1. Inhibition of this&#xD;
      viral protease prevents cleavage of the Gag and Gag-Pol polyproteins resulting in the&#xD;
      production of immature, non-infectious virus. The pharmacokinetic properties of nelfinavir&#xD;
      were evaluated in healthy volunteers and HIV-infected patients. No substantial differences&#xD;
      were observed between the two groups. In Switzerland the registered dose of nelfinavir for&#xD;
      the treatment of HIV-1 infection in combination with other antiretroviral agents is 1250 mg&#xD;
      bid or 750 mg three times daily (tid).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Plasma concentrations from a pharmacokinetic study with 10 HIV-positive patients after&#xD;
      multiple dosing with 1250 mg twice daily for 28 days were 4.0 mg/L (peak plasma level) and&#xD;
      2.2 mg/L / 0.7 mg/L (morning/evening trough), respectively. Peak plasma concentrations were&#xD;
      approximately 6 microM. Nelfinavir in serum is extensively protein-bound (&gt;98%). The area&#xD;
      under the curve (AUC) is 1.5 times higher with the bid regimen compared to the tid regimen,&#xD;
      without significantly elevated toxicity. The maximal concentration of nelfinavir is usually&#xD;
      achieved 3 to 4 hours after administration with food. The effective half-life in blood plasma&#xD;
      ranges from 3 to 5 hours. Multi-dose pharmacokinetics of nelfinavir, have not been studied in&#xD;
      HIV-positive patients with hepatic or renal insufficiency.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nelfinavir is an inhibitor of cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) and is mainly metabolized by&#xD;
      CYP3A4 and CYP2C19. The main metabolite of nelfinavir (the hydroxylated metabolite nelfinavir&#xD;
      M8) is also active against HIV and circulates in the plasma at around 30% of the present&#xD;
      nelfinavir amount.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The dose limiting toxicity (DLT) has not been defined yet. A respective dose finding trial&#xD;
      for nelfinavir mono-therapy in patients with solid tumors is ongoing. Preliminary data from&#xD;
      that trial shows that nelfinavir is well tolerated at 2.5 times (2 x 3125 mg/day) the&#xD;
      American Food and Drug Administration approved dose for the treatment of HIV infections of 2&#xD;
      x 1250 mg/day with no grade 4-5 clinical toxicities. The most prevalent laboratory&#xD;
      abnormalities grade 4 with a dose level (DL) of 3125 mg bid were transaminitis, hyperglycemia&#xD;
      and diarrhea. The AUC of nelfinavir in plasma showed a plateau at doses of 1875 mg bid.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A phase I study of Nelfinavir in liposarcoma with a maximum DL of 4250 mg bid shows a peak&#xD;
      plasma level of 6.3 mg/L. One patient experienced transient grade 3 pancreatitis after one&#xD;
      week of nelfinavir. No other DLTs were observed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recent testing of this nelfinavir dose in combination with radiation therapy and weekly&#xD;
      gemcitabine (200-300 mg/m2) in patients with pancreatic cancer did not cause increased&#xD;
      toxicity in this trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main side effects of nelfinavir include diarrhea (&gt;10%), rash, elevated liver enzymes,&#xD;
      and reduced blood counts (1-10%) at the therapeutic standard concentration of 1250 mg bid.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment Lenalidomide:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lenalidomide (Revlimid) is a derivative of thalidomide. The exact mechanism of action of&#xD;
      these immunomodulatory drugs is not known. Apart from interfering with the immune system,&#xD;
      they are also thought to act on angiogenesis. There are multiple mechanisms of action, and&#xD;
      they can be simplified by organizing them as mechanisms of action in vitro and in vivo. In&#xD;
      vitro, lenalidomide has three main activities: direct anti-tumor effect, inhibition of the&#xD;
      micro-environmental support for tumor cells, and an immunomodulatory role. In vivo,&#xD;
      lenalidomide induces tumor cell apoptosis directly and indirectly by inhibition of bone&#xD;
      marrow stromal cell support, by anti-angiogenic and anti-osteoclastogenic effects, and by&#xD;
      immunomodulatory activity. Lenalidomide has a broad range of activities that can be exploited&#xD;
      to treat many hematologic and solid cancers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lenalidomide is one of the novel drug agents used to treat MM. It is a small molecular&#xD;
      analogue of thalidomide that was originally found based on its ability to effectively inhibit&#xD;
      tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) production. Lenalidomide is 50,000 times more potent than&#xD;
      thalidomide in inhibiting TNF-α, and has less severe adverse drug reactions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The most important side effects of lenalidomide are thromboembolism and hematological&#xD;
      toxicity. The most common side effects are neutropenia, thrombopenia, anemia, fatigue,&#xD;
      constipation, diarrhea, asthenia and rash. In contrast to thalidomide, lenalidomide does not&#xD;
      cause neuropathies. Hematotoxicity is dose dependent and easily manageable with dose&#xD;
      reductions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lenalidomide in combination with dexamethasone is a Swissmedic approved treatment for MM&#xD;
      patients who have received at least one prior medicinal therapy. The combination of&#xD;
      lenalidomide and dexamethasone compared to dexamethasone alone led to significantly improved&#xD;
      progression free survival (median 11.1 vs. 4.6 months) and overall survival (median 38.0 vs.&#xD;
      31.6 months) in patients with relapsed or refractory myeloma in two international phase III&#xD;
      trials. More than 1/3 of these patients had previously been treated with the structurally&#xD;
      related thalidomide.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment Dexamethasone:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dexamethasone is a glucocorticosteroid that is used in the treatment of MM, which reduces the&#xD;
      activity of the immune system by attaching to receptors in various types of immune cells. In&#xD;
      MM, high-dose dexamethasone is used together with chemotherapy to make chemotherapy more&#xD;
      effective and to reduce certain side effects of cancer treatment, such as nausea and&#xD;
      vomiting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It appears to cause apoptosis. This means that steroids such as dexamethasone can trigger the&#xD;
      destruction of myeloma cells. Typically dexamethasone is given with other agents - such as&#xD;
      vincristine, doxorubicin, thalidomide or lenalidomide - to treat MM. It has been found that&#xD;
      steroids can increase the ability of chemotherapeutic and immunomodulatory agents such as&#xD;
      lenalidomide to destroy myeloma cells.&#xD;
