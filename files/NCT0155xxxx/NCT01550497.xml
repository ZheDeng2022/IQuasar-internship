      1. Do spinal stabilization exercises demonstrate immediate and long-term effects of weight&#xD;
           weeks of spinal stabilization exercises as measured by pain intensity and quality of&#xD;
           life scores?&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Does eight weeks of spinal stabilization exercises improve back muscle endurance in&#xD;
           adolescents with Idiopathic Scoliosis (IS) with low back pain (LBP), compared to a&#xD;
           one-time treatment (control)?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypotheses:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research hypothesis for Question 1 is: Participants who receive eight weeks of spinal&#xD;
      stabilization exercises will demonstrate significantly improved pain intensity and quality of&#xD;
      life scores compared to participants who receive a one-time treatment after eight weeks of&#xD;
      the intervention period and at six-month follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research hypothesis for Question 2 is: Participants who receive eight weeks of the spinal&#xD;
      stabilization exercises will demonstrate significantly improved back muscle endurance,&#xD;
      compared to participants who receive a one-time treatment after eight weeks of intervention.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Although idiopathic scoliosis (IS) is the most common type of scoliosis, no studies have&#xD;
      evaluated the effectiveness of physical therapy exercises for managing low back pain (LBP) in&#xD;
      this population. Spinal stabilization exercises are of particular importance in adolescents&#xD;
      with IS due to possible reduced spinal stability from structural deformity. Spinal&#xD;
      stabilization exercises have been reported to prevent recurrent episodes of LBP in the adult&#xD;
      population. However, standardized treatment options cannot be recommended for LBP in&#xD;
      adolescents with IS, because the investigators are not certain if spinal stabilization&#xD;
      exercises will have the same effect on this patient population. Given the high prevalence of&#xD;
      LBP in AIS and limited evidence of conservative interventions, researching the effectiveness&#xD;
      of spinal stabilization exercises is warranted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently, there are two common practices for managing adolescents with IS who have LBP: 1)&#xD;
      supervised physical therapy and 2) a one-time treatment with no follow-up. No studies have&#xD;
      examined which of these two approaches is superior. This study will provide information on&#xD;
      optimal management of LBP in AIS. If there is no difference in outcomes between these two&#xD;
      approaches, a one-time visit will be the optimal choice of treatment since it is more&#xD;
      cost-effective and less burdensome for the family. If the outcomes favor the eight-week&#xD;
      supervised physical therapy, specifically the spinal stabilization exercises, this treatment&#xD;
      approach should be recommended for managing LBP in AIS.&#xD;
