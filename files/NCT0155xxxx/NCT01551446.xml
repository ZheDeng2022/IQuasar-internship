          2. A history of type 2 diabetes; diagnosis should have been made at ≥ 30 years of age (if&#xD;
             diabetes developed at a younger age, a fasting C-peptide level must be ≥ 0.1 ng/mL to&#xD;
             confirm type 2 diabetes);&#xD;

             inhibitor and/or ARB must be stable for 2 weeks prior to and/or during screening&#xD;
             (i.e., no change in dosage or medication). Patients not taking an ACE inhibitor and/or&#xD;
             ARB, or taking an ACE inhibitor and/or ARB at levels below the goal dose set by K/DOQI&#xD;
             guidelines must have a documented medical contraindication (e.g., hyperkalemia,&#xD;
             hypotension), which the investigator must provide and discuss with a medical monitor&#xD;
             prior to Study Day 1. Patients not taking an ACE inhibitor and/or ARB because of a&#xD;

             pressure (DBP) ≤90 mmHg during screening; both mean SBP and mean DBP (determined as&#xD;
             the average of three readings) must be within the described range during the screening&#xD;
             period;&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Willing to practice methods of birth control (both males who have partners of&#xD;
             childbearing potential and females of childbearing potential) during screening, while&#xD;
             taking study drug and for at least 30 days after the last dose of study drug is&#xD;
             ingested;&#xD;

             exists, a fasting C-peptide level must confirm type 2 diabetes;&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Known non-diabetic renal disease (e.g., known polycystic kidney disease, family&#xD;
             history of a hereditary form of kidney disease, or congenital absence of one kidney)&#xD;
             [nephrosclerosis superimposed on diabetic kidney disease is acceptable];&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Ongoing clinical investigation with evidence (e.g., unexplained hematuria or red blood&#xD;
             cell or white blood cell casts) suggesting non-diabetic renal disease other than&#xD;
             nephrosclerosis;&#xD;
