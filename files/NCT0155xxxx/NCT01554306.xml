  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder that is characterized with motor&#xD;
      symptoms such as hypokinesia, rigidity, tremor and postural instability. These symptoms can&#xD;
      also be present during the night. Half of the patients with PD have difficulty turning around&#xD;
      in bed. This nocturnal hypokinesia is considered as a possible cause of sleep problems in&#xD;
      this population. The diagnosis nocturnal hypokinesia is based on the clinical interview.&#xD;
      There is a need for a diagnostic devices that measures nocturnal movements, preferably in the&#xD;
      home setting. This device can be used in the diagnostic trajectory as well in the evaluation&#xD;
      of treatment. Recently the Dynaport Minimod (McRoberts, The Hague) has been developed to&#xD;
      register nocturnal movements. The tri-axial accelerometer has been developed to measure&#xD;
      position changes in the night. A validation study with actigraphy and polysomnography&#xD;
      concluded that the Dynaport MiniMod is a valid an feasible device for assessing intensity and&#xD;
      physical activity and changes of body position during sleep.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nocturnal hypokinesia is treated with nocturnal dopamine. Sometimes a night-time dose of&#xD;
      dopaminergics is adequate, but most of the time slow release dopaminergics are needed.&#xD;
      However response fluctuations can negatively influence the treatment. In these cases&#xD;
      continuous dopaminergic stimulation is needed, such as rotigotine. Rotigotine treats response&#xD;
      fluctuations during the day and studies show that sleep quality measured with questionnaires&#xD;
      improves. If the improvement of sleep quality is caused by improved bed mobility has not been&#xD;
      studied yet. The study hypothesis is that rotigotine does not influence nocturnal hypokinesia&#xD;
      in PD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective of the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary:&#xD;
&#xD;
      • To study the effect of rotigotine on nocturnal hypokinesia&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To study the possibility of measuring nocturnal hypokinesia and its severity in a home&#xD;
           setting&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To correlate improvements in sleep quality by rotigotine with changes in nocturnal&#xD;
           hypokinesia&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will study patients who will recieve rotigotine as a part of their usual care. During&#xD;
      three nights, nocturnal movements are being registered with movement sensors, before&#xD;
      treatment has started as well as after a stable medication dose of one month. We will also&#xD;
      assess sleep quality with questionnaires.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study population are patients with Parkinson's disease with sleep problems caused by&#xD;
      nocturnal hypokinesia, who will start treatment with rotigotine. Patients will be recruited&#xD;
      in the neurology patient outdoor clinic of the Radboud University Medical Centre Nijmegen. We&#xD;
      will ask the treating neurologist to inform us when a patient will start treatment with&#xD;
      rotigotine. One of the researchers will contact the patient to give further information about&#xD;
      the study. The study is a first hypothesis generating study and we will start with the&#xD;
      inclusion of 10 patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention (if applicable):&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary study parameters/outcome of the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Position changes over the night.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secundary study parameters/outcome of the study (if applicable):&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Degree of mobility, measured as the speed of the movements&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Total amount of movements&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Score on the motor symptom scale according to the MDS-UPDRS part III&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjective&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Nocturnal sleep quality Excessive daytime sleepiness&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Presence of nocturnal akinesia&#xD;
