    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to investigate water flow in dental devices and to&#xD;
      understand the function of water flow behind oral hygiene improvements. Understanding this&#xD;
      mechanism may help with the design of future products.&#xD;

      The overall clinical response (plaque, gingivitis, bleeding) in participants with varying&#xD;
      stages of gingival health as well as the causative or indicative hallmarks of selected&#xD;
      biological responses underpinning the overt clinical manifestations described above will be&#xD;
      evaluated. The chief biological response that will be investigated is how a reduction in the&#xD;
      concentration of bacterial lipopolysaccharide endotoxins (LPS) in interproximal plaque may&#xD;
      influence improvements in the clinical response (e.g., through mitigation of bleeding) when&#xD;
      compared to a change in the plaque biomass within which a large component of the endotoxins&#xD;
      reside. The hypothesis is that improvements in clinical bleeding may result more from the&#xD;
      removal or reduction of toxic bacterial products that serve as the direct impetus of the&#xD;
      inflammatory response rather than from sheer bulk removal of interproximal plaque. From a&#xD;
      methods development perspective, this study will also assess the feasibility of measuring&#xD;
      endotoxin load from clinical samples. Ultimately it is anticipated that a comprehensive&#xD;
      evaluation of clinical benefits conferred by continuous fluid streaming will emerge upon&#xD;
      analysis of the relationships between clinical and biological data sets, particularly where&#xD;
      causal relationships may exist between both parameters.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The devices used in this study are subject only to Class I (general controls) and considered&#xD;
      exempt from the premarket notification procedures and not subject to section 510(k), 515, or&#xD;
      520(m,) of the FDC Act in order to be legally marketed. Thus, the study does not meet the&#xD;
      definition of an Applicable Clinical Trial.&#xD;
