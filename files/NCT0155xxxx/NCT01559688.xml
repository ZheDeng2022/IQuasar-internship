  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Service members and veterans often experience symptoms of psychological trauma following&#xD;
      combat deployments. While efforts are being made in the military and at the Veteran's Affairs&#xD;
      to meet the large number of soldiers and veterans experiencing symptoms of psychological&#xD;
      trauma, there remains a need to evaluate new treatments, particularly those that are designed&#xD;
      to be brief in length.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A new therapy, known as Accelerated Resolution Therapy (ART), is a type of psychological&#xD;
      therapy that is designed for rapid resolution of symptoms of psychological trauma. This&#xD;
      approach uses a combination of talking and sets of eye movements guided by the therapist.&#xD;
      During therapy, this interactive personal guidance is thought to be helpful in resolving&#xD;
      problems (such as bad memories).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Evaluate how effective ART is in treating symptoms of psychological trauma among&#xD;
           non-active duty veterans who served in Operation Iraqi Freedom and Operation Enduring&#xD;
           Freedom in Iraq and in Afghanistan or other combat conflicts.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Learn if there is improvement in symptoms of psychological trauma (such as bad memories,&#xD;
           anxiety, depression, and guilt) after receiving Accelerated Resolution Therapy (ART).&#xD;
