  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This PMS study aims to collect safety and reactogenicity data of Cervarix in the local&#xD;
      population as per the licensing requirement of the Sri Lankan regulatory authority.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Subjects who received one or two doses of Cervarix prior to the start of this PMS study can&#xD;
      also be enrolled in the study. These subjects would receive either 2 doses or 1 dose&#xD;
      respectively after being enrolled in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since there is lack of clarity regarding the PMS study requirement (both from Regulatory&#xD;
      agency and Ethics Committee), it was decided that GSK will submit Local PSURs on a regular&#xD;
      basis as desired by Local regulatory agency. The same is communicated to Regulatory agency&#xD;
      and if they want something more they are requested to revert back with specific requirements.&#xD;

    Lack of clarity regarding the PMS study requirement from the RA and Ethics committee hence it&#xD;
    was concluded GSK will submit local PSURs&#xD;
