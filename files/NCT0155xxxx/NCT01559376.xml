    <textblock>
      The objectives of the study are two-fold:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To determine the mean 5 year patency rate of the radial artery graft (Open vs.&#xD;
           Endoscopic) of patients who have already had CABG surgery and who previously&#xD;
           participated in the centre's RCT back in 2005-2007 using CTA and MPS-MIBI&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To determine patient quality of life at 5 years post CABG surgery&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is hypothesized that the mean 5 year patency rate of the radial artery graft harvested&#xD;
      endoscopically will be equal to or have greater patency than the radial artery graft&#xD;
      harvested via the conventional/open technique. It is further hypothesized that patient&#xD;
      quality of life will be similar amongst patients having had the open vs. endoscopic radial&#xD;
      artery graft during CABG surgery.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      After patient consent and REB approval from The University of Western Ontario (REB # 11054)&#xD;
      we conducted a Randomized Controlled Trial between 2005-2007 of endoscopic vs. conventional&#xD;
      harvesting of the radial artery in CABG patients at the London Health Sciences Centre. A&#xD;
      total of 118 patients were randomized to either A) conventional/open harvesting of the radial&#xD;
      artery, n=59 or B) endoscopic harvesting of the radial artery, n=59. Post-operative study&#xD;
      objectives measured were arm wound infection rate, assessment of arm pain, arm edema,&#xD;
      mobilization, patient satisfaction, and histological assessment of the radial artery.&#xD;
      Objectives were measured during the patients' course in-hospital and at 1week by telephone&#xD;
      interview. At 6 weeks patient underwent a final clinic assessment post-surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our intent is to perform follow-up angiography and MPS-MIBI at the 5 year mark post surgery&#xD;
      on the 118 patients previously involved in our RCT, to assess open vs. endoscopic radial&#xD;
      artery graft performance. The study will be divided into three phases: Phase I - Patient&#xD;
      Recruitment (4 months), Phase II - Patient Assessment with CTA, MPS-MIBI and Questionnaires&#xD;
      (16 months) and Phase III - Data Analysis and Conclusions (4 months).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase I - Chart Review and Patient Recruitment (4 Months) Charts will be reviewed on all of&#xD;
      the open and endoscopically harvested radial artery grafts used during CABG surgery from the&#xD;
      above specified time points. Patient demographics and operative notes, as well as&#xD;
      perioperative and postoperative complications will be reviewed. Hospital admissions,&#xD;
      documented cardiac events and any subsequent deaths not previously documented will be&#xD;
      recorded. Any additional pertinent data from the chart review will be entered into a study&#xD;
      specific Microsoft Excel file maintained by a single qualified research assistant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All living CABG surgery patients will then be contacted and their participation in the study&#xD;
      requested. Patients will receive an initial request by mail, with an informative letter&#xD;
      signed by the principal investigator outlining the purpose of the study, what participation&#xD;
      in the study involves, and the specific aims of the cardiac team at the conclusion of the&#xD;
      study. A follow-up phone call will be done within 3-weeks of mailing the letter to go over&#xD;
      the content and answer any questions that patients may have.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase II - Patient Assessment via CTA, MPS-MIBI and Questionnaires (16 Months)&#xD;
&#xD;
      CABG surgery patients from the previous RCT that agree to be a part of the study will have&#xD;
      arrangements made for them to travel to LHSC. Patients will undergo a structured half-day&#xD;
      (approximately 4-6 hours) at the hospital consisting of the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Selective coronary artery and radial artery graft check via CTA with a 64 slice CT&#xD;
           scanner + Rest MPS-MIBI then Stress MPS-MIBI (4-6hrs). The CT scanner along with the&#xD;
           stress/rest MIBI machine are dedicated &quot;Research only&quot; machines. As such, there are no&#xD;
           issues with using these research dedicated machines and there is no additional cost to&#xD;
           OHIP.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Completion of two validated health related quality of life questionnaires&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Seattle Angina Questionnaire&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. 36-Item Short Form Health Survey SELECTIVE CORONARY ARTERY &amp; RADIAL ARTERY GRAFT&#xD;
                CHECK VIA CTA AND REST &amp; STRESS MPS-MIBI&#xD;
&#xD;
      Coronary CTA and Rest and Stress MPS-MIBI will be used for evaluating radial artery graft&#xD;
      patency. Potential risks associated with CTA and both MPS-MIBI tests will be discussed with&#xD;
      each patient prior to performing the procedure. This discussion will include the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
      As CTA is an x-ray test, it sends radiation through the body. Although the amount of&#xD;
      radiation for each scan is small, it can accumulate and damage body cells over time with&#xD;
      repeated exposure. Contrast material carries a slight risk of causing an allergic reaction to&#xD;
      the contrast material or dye. During the Rest and Stress MPS-MIBI, a radioactive tracer&#xD;
      (MIBI) is used to take pictures of the heart. This tracer is injected into the bloodstream&#xD;
      and travels to the heart muscle through the coronary arteries. Pictures are then taken of the&#xD;
      heart to determine coronary artery disease and the perfusion images at rest and stress help&#xD;
      identify regions of myocardial infarction as well as help determine the hemodynamic&#xD;
      significance of any coronary stenoses. MPS also gives an estimate of the left ventricular&#xD;
      ejection fraction. Signed consent will be obtained prior to each procedure. Contrast will be&#xD;
      injected into the coronary arteries and the vein grafts and CTA and MPS-MIBI images obtained.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EVALUATING RADIAL ARTERY GRAFT PATENCY All coronary artery and radial artery graft CTAs and&#xD;
      MPS-MIBIs will be performed and graded by Nuclear Medicine physicians. Following the patency&#xD;
      determination, the patients will be contacted by Dr.Bob Kiaii (cardiac surgeon) and told&#xD;
      their results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Radial artery graft patency will be determined using the grading system of Fitzgibbons and&#xD;
      associates:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Grade A Excellent graft with unimpaired run-off, patent graft Grade B Stenosis reducing&#xD;
      caliber of proximal, distal anastomosis or trunk to &lt;50% of the grafted coronary artery. This&#xD;
      will be divided into flow limiting and non-flow limiting stenosis Grade O Occlusion&#xD;
&#xD;
      QUALITY OF LIFE QUESTIONNAIRES To assess quality of life 5 years after undergoing CABG&#xD;
      surgery and participating in our RCT, each patient will self-administer two validated&#xD;
      health-related quality of life questionnaires while on site at LHSC. The two questionnaires&#xD;
      to be used are the Seattle Angina Questionnaire (SAQ) and the 36-Item Short Form Health&#xD;
      Survey. Licensing and user registration permitting use of these questionnaires will be&#xD;
      obtained online from Cardiovascular Outcomes Inc. (SAQ) and Quality Metric (SF-36) prior to&#xD;
      their distribution and use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SEATTLE ANGINA QUESTIONNAIRE The SAQ is a 19-item, well standardized self-administered&#xD;
      questionnaire shown to be a valid measure of quality of life in patients suffering from&#xD;
      coronary artery disease. The disease-specific questionnaire measures five clinically&#xD;
      important dimensions of health in coronary artery disease patients: physical limitations,&#xD;
      angina stability, angina frequency, treatment satisfaction and disease perception. The SAQ&#xD;
      has shown to be more sensitive to clinical change in coronary artery disease in comparison to&#xD;
      more generic quality of life questionnaires.&#xD;
&#xD;
      36-ITEM SHORT FORM HEALTH SURVEY The SF-36 is a 36-item, generic quality of life&#xD;
      questionnaire for measuring patient's general health status. Also well-standardized and&#xD;
      self-administered, the SF-36 measures eight health concepts: physical conditioning, role&#xD;
      limitations due to physical problems, social functioning, bodily pain, and general mental&#xD;
      health, role limitations due to emotional problems, vitality and general health perceptions.&#xD;
      It also includes an indication of perceived change in health. The questionnaire has proven&#xD;
      relevant across age, disease process and treatment group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Using a disease-specific questionnaire and a general health questionnaire in combination will&#xD;
      more aptly categorize the overall impact of the CABG surgery on patient quality of life. The&#xD;
      effects of CABG surgery both in regards to cardiovascular function as well as outside systems&#xD;
      will be better understood.&#xD;
