  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The duration of treatment of community acquired pulmonary infection varies between 5 and 14&#xD;
      days according to the authors (22), or even 3 days with new drugs having long half-life (2).&#xD;
      For nosocomial pulmonary infection, treatment durations are not standardized (5). It is&#xD;
      simply mentioned the concept of &quot;usual&quot; treatment of at least 15 days. However, recent&#xD;
      studies used 10 days of treatment without significant decrease in the rate of healing&#xD;
      compared to usual treatment. It is essential to clarify the optimal duration of antibiotic&#xD;
      treatment. Indeed, any excessive extension of treatment may increase the occurrence of&#xD;
      adverse effects (renal toxicities, hepatic...), and induce resistance of bacteria to&#xD;
      antibiotics (selection pressure), colonization of the patient by Multiresistant bacteria and&#xD;
      an increase in the cost of treatment&#xD;

      This is a prospective, randomized, open, multi-center study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.1 Primary Objective&#xD;
&#xD;
      Show that antibiotic therapy of 8 or 15 days is equivalent in terms of clinical cure rates in&#xD;
      the treatment of early onset nosocomial pulmonary infection in patients under mechanical&#xD;
      ventilation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.2 Secondary Objective&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Study of nosocomial infections: assessing the influence of the duration of antibiotic&#xD;
           treatment on the rate of fatal pulmonary and extra-pulmonary infection (definition of&#xD;
           nosocomial infections: annex XIII).&#xD;
&#xD;
           • Study of bacterial Ecology: research of changes in the flora of the gut under&#xD;
           treatment and analysis of pathological samples (antibiotic resistance phenotypes&#xD;
           +/-genotypes).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Economic Survey: analyze the costs related to the treatment of nosocomial pneumonia and&#xD;
           its complications in two study groups.&#xD;

    <description>The primary endpoint of the present study was the clinical cure rate at day 21. Complete clinical recovery was determined by the absence of the following criteria: death, septic shock (except when associated with a documented non-respiratory infection), intercurrent adverse event attributable to the protocol (or for which attributability to the protocol could not be ruled out) requiring modified antibiotic treatment, and patients who relapsed.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Rate of secondary infections</measure>
    <time_frame>21 days</time_frame>
    <description>The study focused on establishing incidence of secondary nosocomial infections; number of patients on antibiotic treatment; total number of days of antibiotic treatment; duration of MV; number of patients still under ventilation; number of patients still in ICU; length of stay in ICU on day 21; and mortality rate at 3 months.</description>
