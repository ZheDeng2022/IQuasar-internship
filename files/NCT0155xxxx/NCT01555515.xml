    <textblock>
      In this End Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) patients who need Erythropoietin (epo) hormone will&#xD;
      get it by a small implant of skin using their own skin, the implant will be treated in the&#xD;
      laboratory and programmed to secrete Epo. The implant secretes the patients own epo&#xD;
      minimizing the need for injections for a period of up to 6 months.&#xD;

      This will be a Phase I-II, open-label, single-center, uncontrolled, tailored dose study. The&#xD;
      trial will be conducted in Israel at the Tel Aviv Sourasky Medical Center.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will undergo similar study procedures and evaluations; however each patient will&#xD;
      receive his or her own individually targeted dose of EPO delivered via EPODURE Biopumps. The&#xD;
      targeted dose may vary between 20IU/kg/d to 65IU/kg/d based on each patient's weight, the&#xD;
      historical average EPO amount administered and historical Hb levels including at least the 3&#xD;
      months prior to inclusion in the study. The objective is maintaining Hb levels within the&#xD;
      target range of 10-12 g/dl.&#xD;
