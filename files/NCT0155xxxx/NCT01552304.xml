      Hypotheses:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Postoperative oxygen therapy significantly improves postoperative oxygenation in OSA&#xD;
           surgical patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Postoperative oxygen therapy do not significantly increase the number of apnea episodes&#xD;
           and the duration of apnea episodes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Postoperative oxygen therapy do not significantly increase arterial carbon dioxide(CO2)&#xD;
           level in OSA surgical patients.&#xD;

      When patients visit the preoperative clinic for their scheduled surgery, the study&#xD;
      coordinator will talk to patients. If they are interested in the study, he/she will ask the&#xD;
      patient to answer a couple of questionnaires to see if the patient is qualified for the&#xD;
      study. Patients will be asked to answer the STOP-Bang questionnaire to find out if patient is&#xD;
      at high risk for sleep apnea. If the result shown that patient are at high risk for sleep&#xD;
      apnea, the study coordinator will explain the study to you in detail and go over the consent&#xD;
      form. The coordinator will answer all questions patient may have. If patient give consent to&#xD;
      participate the study; the coordinator will schedule a sleep study with a sleep monitor at&#xD;
      patient home at a convenient time before surgery. After telephone confirmation, the sleep&#xD;
      technician will visit your home on the evening of scheduled date to set up the sleep study&#xD;
      monitor and a device to measure the blood oxygen level. It would take 20~25 minutes to hook&#xD;
      up for over night sleep study. The sleep technician will visit patient's again the next&#xD;
      morning to pick up the devices. The recordings of sleep study will be scored by a certified&#xD;
      sleep technologist. As a study participant, patient will be randomly (by chance) assigned&#xD;
      into one of the following groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Control group: Patients will be managed by the anesthesiologists and surgeons as per&#xD;
           routine practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Oxygen therapy group: Besides during surgical procedure routine care provided by&#xD;
           anesthesiologists and surgeons, patients will receive postoperative oxygen&#xD;
           supplementation with nasal prong (through nostril) at 3 liters/ min during the first 3&#xD;
           nights after surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Regardless what group patients are in, their blood oxygen saturation will be monitored by a&#xD;
      pulse oximeter for 1 night preoperatively and 3 nights postoperatively during their sleep.&#xD;
      The blood carbon dioxide will be monitored for first 2 postoperative nights with a portable&#xD;
      transcutaneous CO2 device (TCM400). On the third postoperative night, all study patients will&#xD;
      also be monitored simultaneously by a portable carbon dioxide device(TCM400) and portable&#xD;
      sleep device. For carbon dioxide monitoring, a probe will be attached to patient's arm which&#xD;
      is connected to a portable device placed besides patient's bed. Our research staff will hook&#xD;
      up the device and remove it from patient.&#xD;
