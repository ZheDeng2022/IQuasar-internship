    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare a standard chemotherapy regimen of cyclophosphamide,&#xD;
      dexamethasone plus thalidomide with a newer regimen of cyclophosphamide, dexamethasone plus&#xD;
      lenalidomide with or without carfilzomib.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who do not have the best response to their initial treatment may then also be given&#xD;
      a combination of cyclophosphamide, dexamethasone plus bortezomib.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who are relatively fit may, on their doctor's advice, go on to receive more&#xD;
      intensive chemotherapy, supported with a transplant of their own blood cells. This is&#xD;
      standard treatment which patients may be offered anyway even if they didn't take part in this&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After maximal response has been achieved with the treatment described above, and as long as&#xD;
      the myeloma has not got worse, patients will be treated with either long-term lenalidomide,&#xD;
      lenalidomide with vorinostat, or receive no further treatment, with close observation.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The last ten years has seen the introduction of a number of effective new anti-myeloma agents&#xD;
      into the clinical arena. These agents have been shown to be highly effective in the relapse&#xD;
      setting and now are being introduced as treatment earlier in the disease course.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aims to address in the randomised setting some of the key questions concerning the&#xD;
      use of thalidomide, bortezomib, lenalidomide, carfilzomib and vorinostat in the initial&#xD;
      treatment of multiple myeloma patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Newly diagnosed patients of all ages with symptomatic myeloma requiring treatment are&#xD;
      eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For initial treatment, thalidomide in combination with cyclophosphamide and dexamethasone,&#xD;
      the UK gold standard, will be compared with the newer combination of lenalidomide,&#xD;
      cyclophosphamide and dexamethasone with or without carfilzomib.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For patients with a sub-optimal response to initial therapy, the response to the proteasome&#xD;
      inhibitor bortezomib will be assessed, as previous studies have demonstrated that it is able&#xD;
      to induce responses and improve progression-free and overall survival in patients resistant&#xD;
      to standard chemotherapy. Patients young and fit enough to tolerate an autologous transplant&#xD;
      will then proceed to high dose melphalan with peripheral blood stem cell rescue and then on&#xD;
      to maintenance randomisation. Older or less fit patients will go directly to a maintenance&#xD;
      randomisation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The value of lenalidomide and lenalidomide combined with vorinostat maintenance will then be&#xD;
      assessed by randomising eligible patients to receive either lenalidomide, lenalidomide&#xD;
      combined with vorinostat maintenance therapy, or close observation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary end points of the study are overall and progression-free survival (OS and PFS).&#xD;
      Secondary end points include response and toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A number of laboratory based studies will also be performed in order to determine patient&#xD;
      specific factors predicting overall and progression-free survival and response to treatment.&#xD;
