  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In preclinical studies, the anti-cancer efficacy of fenretinide, a synthetic retinoid that&#xD;
      causes cytotoxicity by mechanisms which include increased intracellular dihydroceramides, has&#xD;
      been shown to be enhanced by safingol, a stereochemical-variant dihydroceramide precursor.&#xD;
      This phase I study represents the first clinical trial employing this promising combination.&#xD;
      The drug administration schedule (fenretinide given on Days 1-5, safingol given on Days 1-2&#xD;
      of each 21-day cycle) reflects the in vitro observation that tumor cell exposure to safingol&#xD;
      increased fenretinide efficacy both during and after safingol administration. The total dose&#xD;
      of fenretinide, 4600 mg/m2 over 5 days, represents a 30% total dose reduction from the single&#xD;
      agent MTD dose of 1280 mg/m2/day x 5 days determined on the PhI-42 study. This fenretinide&#xD;
      dose is expected to produce plasma levels in the 30?s ?M. This dose reduction has been&#xD;
      employed to reduce the potential for overlapping hepatic toxicities between these two agents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The administration of a reduced fenretinide dose on Day 1 (600 mg/m2 on Day 1, escalated to&#xD;
      1000 mg/m2/day on Days 2-5) has been selected due to earlier observations that initial&#xD;
      exposure to the soy bean oil vehicle in the fenretinide emulsion may induce endogenous&#xD;
      lipases, thereby permitting tolerance of higher total doses fenretinide emulsion subsequently&#xD;
      administered. The starting dose of safingol in this study, 210 mg/m2/day x 2 days (420 mg/m2&#xD;
      total), corresponds to 50% of the recommended Phase II safingol dose (bolus) determined in&#xD;
      the Schwartz, et al, Phase I study of safingol plus cisplatin 60 mg/m2 (the MTD of&#xD;
      single-agent, intravenous (emulsion) safingol was not reached in the Phase I safingol run-in&#xD;
      monotherapy portion of this study), and was selected to provide an adequate safety margin&#xD;
      against the potential for overlapping toxicities (such as hepatic transaminitis).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study has been designed to optimize the safety of this novel combination. Treatment will&#xD;
      be administered in the inpatient setting. Central venous access will be mandated to avoid the&#xD;
      potential for hemolysis and thrombophlebitis associated with the preclinical peripheral&#xD;
      administration of a previous safingol formulation in rats. To reduce the incidence of&#xD;
      hypertriglyceridemia, a revised fenretinide delivery schedule will be employed. Patients will&#xD;
      also be encouraged to maintain a low-fat diet during fenretinide administration. Serum&#xD;
      triglycerides will be monitored every 12 hours. To monitor for cardiac toxicity, which was&#xD;
      noted in canine studies at the highest dose of safingol plus fenretinide tested, serum&#xD;
      troponin T levels will be monitored daily. To limit the potential for hepatotoxicity&#xD;
      resulting from a possible drug interaction observed between intravenous fenretinide,&#xD;
      ceftriaxone and acetaminophen in a pediatric patient, the concurrent administration of&#xD;
      ceftriaxone, or acetaminophen, with the fenretinide emulsion infusion will be prohibited.&#xD;

&#xD;
          4. Pregnant women are excluded from this study because the effects of fenretinide and&#xD;

&#xD;
         14. Patients with esophageal cancer with unresected or recurrent primary tumors in the&#xD;
