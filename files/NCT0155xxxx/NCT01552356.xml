  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase I trial studies the side effects and the best dose of pazopanib hydrochloride in&#xD;
      treating patients with solid tumors that has spread to other places in the body and usually&#xD;
      cannot be cured or controlled with treatment (advanced) or does not respond to treatment&#xD;
      (refractory). Pazopanib hydrochloride may prevent the growth of new blood vessels that tumors&#xD;
      need to grow. Studying samples of blood in the laboratory from patients receiving pazopanib&#xD;
      hydrochloride may help doctors learn more about the effects of the body on the drug. It may&#xD;
      also help doctors understand how well patients respond to treatment.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To assess the feasibility and safety of individualizing pazopanib (pazopanib&#xD;
      hydrochloride) monotherapy based upon attained pazopanib plasma concentrations so as to&#xD;
      achieve desired target pazopanib plasma concentration in the highest possible fraction of&#xD;
      treated patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To assess whether patient cytochrome P450 (CYP) or other polymorphisms may correlate with&#xD;
      attained pazopanib levels in response to standard pazopanib dosing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To assess whether patient trough pazopanib levels attained 24 hours after initiation of&#xD;
      800 mg daily fasting may predict steady state trough pazopanib levels after 14 days of&#xD;
      pazopanib administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To assess whether patient trough pazopanib levels may correlate with observed pazopanib&#xD;
      toxicities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive pazopanib hydrochloride orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-28. Courses&#xD;
      repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Course&#xD;
      length can be extended to 56 days at the discretion of the treating physician after 12&#xD;
      courses (1 year) of treatment on study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 3 months.&#xD;
