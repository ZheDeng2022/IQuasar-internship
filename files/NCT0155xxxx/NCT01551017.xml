    <textblock>
      Fast Track Recovery Arthroplasty Project is supposed to analyse a new medical method to&#xD;
      accelerate patient's remobilisation process after total knee endoprostheses. The method,&#xD;
      called c-treatment, is a computer-controlled cryotherapy (soothing cooling therapy) at which&#xD;
      the device measures temperature at the affected site (the operated knee in the investigators&#xD;
      investigation) and optimizes the cooling temperature. The optimized cooling therapy is&#xD;
      supposed to reduce swelling and postoperative pain whereby patient's postoperative&#xD;
      mobilization can be done earlier leading to a reduction of length of hospitalization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To verify c-treatment's efficiency compared to conventional cryotherapy, patients are split&#xD;
      in a test group and a standard group. The standard group is treated following the standard&#xD;
      protocol at the Department of Orthopaedics Surgery Graz using cold packs (Fa. Dahlhausen,&#xD;
      product code 93.000.00.042). Patient's in the test group receive c-treatment therapy&#xD;
      following the study protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients are instructed to fill in standardized questionnaires to evaluate social scores&#xD;
      and pain scores preoperative as well as postoperative. The knee's swelling and range of&#xD;
      motion as well as blood parameters monitoring the healing process are measured following the&#xD;
      study protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The comparison of these parameters between the standard and the test group is supposed to&#xD;
      verify c-treatment's efficiency.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this prospective, randomized, single-blind, comparative and controlled&#xD;
      clinical study was to evaluate a new cryotherapy device, the cTreatment® system (Waegener®,&#xD;
      Belgium) consisting of the Cryoceutical Treatment Server 100 series (CTS) and the&#xD;
      Cryoceutical Treatment Pad (cPad®), in comparison to the standard cooling protocol, which was&#xD;
      the cold packs (cold/hot pack, Dahlhausen®) currently used at the Department of Orthopaedic&#xD;
      Surgery of the Medical University of Graz, Austria, in patients undergoing primary and&#xD;
      unilateral TKA surgery. It was particularly focused on the device's efficiency in terms of&#xD;
      eventual improvements in the patient's postoperative rehabilitation and mobilisation, such as&#xD;
      positive alterations of knee ROM and NRS pain scale, which were set as primary objectives.&#xD;
      Further contributing elements, such as alterations of the analgesic consumption, knee girth&#xD;
      and the device's safety were set as secondary objectives.&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODS&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects between 18 and 90 suffering from severe degeneratively or traumatically caused&#xD;
      gonarthritis or gonarthrosis of the knee joint scheduled for endoprothetic treatment with TKA&#xD;
      could be included when giving their informed consent. Exclusion criteria particularly&#xD;
      included, on the one side, reasons, which might interfere with the patients' statistical&#xD;
      comparability regarding the outcome, such as severe pre-existing local and systemic&#xD;
      conditions others than gonarthritis and foregone surgical interventions others than&#xD;
      arthroscopy. On the other side it contained conditions, which would interfere with the&#xD;
      planned study design, for instance, the standardized medication and PCA and long cooling&#xD;
      intervals during hospitalisation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After giving their written consent they were further randomized to the cryotherapy group,&#xD;
      receiving the cTreatment®, or the standard group, receiving cold pack application. Therefore&#xD;
      a web-based programme, the &quot;Randomizer&quot;, was used (23), considering the patient's sex and&#xD;
      scheduled design type of endoprostheses to be implanted, which was either the PFC® or the&#xD;
      LCS® (both from DePuy®, Warsaw, IN, USA) endoprosthesis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After being randomized to the therapy group patients were assigned to the locally applied&#xD;
      cryotherapy treatment by use of the cTreatment® system until the end of the clinical study,&#xD;
      which was set for POD six. That implied the first cooling session to the extent of one hour&#xD;
      already preoperatively on the first preoperative day (PreOD), which coincidently was the day&#xD;
      of admission throughout all cases. Furthermore, the subjects received cryotherapy immediately&#xD;
      after TKA in the postanaesthesia care unit for six hours in total. During the in-patient&#xD;
      setting until POD six the cTreatment® was applied each day for four hours in total, divided&#xD;
      into two hours in the morning and two hours in the afternoon. Also there was the option to&#xD;
      use the cTreatment® in terms of additional analgesia in the evening for up to four hours on&#xD;
      each POD.&#xD;

      According to the manufacturer, the CTS is a class IIa medical device, which thermodynamically&#xD;
      exchanges heat controlled by a built-in computer. It is able to regulate both the flow rate&#xD;
      and the fluid's temperature reaching the cPad®. The CTS is operated by use of a touch screen,&#xD;
      which allows to start, pause, resume and stop a cooling session. According to the instruction&#xD;
      manual the cPad®, which is connected to the Server with flexible tubes using anti-reflux&#xD;
      design, is made of flexible Polyurethane, latex free and hypoallergenic. Using hook and loop&#xD;
      fasteners it is easy to wrap around the knee ensuring a maximum of contact surface.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The control group was treated abiding by the standard cryotherapy regimen at the Department&#xD;
      of Orthopaedic Surgery including the usage of common cold packs (cold/hot pack, Dahlhausen®).&#xD;
      They did not receive any cryotherapy before the surgical intervention corresponding to the&#xD;
      standard regimen. After TKA cold packs were applied three times per day for 20 minutes each&#xD;
      throughout the whole trial. In the context of blinding, the cold packs were placed beneath&#xD;
      the applied cPads® in subjects randomized to the standard group, in order to account for a&#xD;
      subjectively experienced cold as the CTS was turned off. Besides that, the study setting was&#xD;
      identical in both groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the purpose of a better comparability all participating patients received general&#xD;
      anaesthesia and a postoperative analgetic therapy based on patient controlled analgesia&#xD;
      (PCA), which was filled with diluted hydromorphone, accounting for 0,2 mg hydromorphone per&#xD;
      single dose. In addition to that, exclusively Novalgin® 4 x 1 g was administered as a&#xD;
      non-opiate analgesic. The PCA was removed after 72 hours postoperative.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The performed physical measurements consisted of the quantification of the knee girth and the&#xD;
      ROM of the treated knee joint. The measurements concerning the knee girth were performed at&#xD;
      three different levels, at middle-patella, 7 centimetres proximal of the patellar base and 7&#xD;
      centimetres distal of the apex patellae. The ROM was evaluated by use of a hand-held&#xD;
      goniometer and the patient being in a supine position. Among the non-physical evaluations was&#xD;
      verbally assessing the subjectively experienced pain intensity by use of the eleven-point&#xD;
      numeric rating scale (NRS) pain score, about which each patients was told that zero was equal&#xD;
      to &quot;no pain at all&quot; and ten was equal to &quot;strongest pain imaginable&quot;. The NRS was always&#xD;
      evaluated for the state of absolute rest and the state of motion. In this relation the more&#xD;
      objectively evaluable analgesics consumption was recorded. Therefore the total hydromorphone&#xD;
      usage administered by use of PCA after 72 hours was noted. The physical examinations of the&#xD;
      knee joint's ROM and girth and the NRS score evaluation were performed on admission day and&#xD;
      POD two, four and six. In the course of the regular change of dressings during the medical&#xD;
      rounds the surgical area was exactly examined for potential cold-induced local alterations.&#xD;
      In this context, it was particularly searched for signs of frostbite, nerve palsy, inhibited&#xD;
      wound healing, deep vein thrombosis and infection. In case of occurrence, the patients had&#xD;
      also been told to immediately call attention to eventual adverse effects related to the cold&#xD;
      therapy, which they were preliminarily informed about.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IBM® SPSS® Statistics software version 20 was used in order to perform all statistical&#xD;
      analyses. In this regard descriptive statistics were conducted using basic calculations of&#xD;
      means, standard deviations, ranges, minima and maxima. For the comparisons between the two&#xD;
      study groups on admission day, POD two, four and six measured data was first checked for the&#xD;
      existence of normal distribution by use of Shapiro-Wilk and Kolmogorov- Smirnov tests. In&#xD;
      case of normal distribution, the independent-samples t-test as parametric test was performed.&#xD;
      If a normal distribution did not exist, the Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test as non-parametric test&#xD;
      was performed in order to obtain values of significance regarding between-group distinctions.&#xD;
      Throughout the statistical analyses, the level of significance, respectively the P-value was&#xD;
      defined as ≤ 0,05.&#xD;
