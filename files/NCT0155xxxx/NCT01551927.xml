      Aim: To investigate and compare women's and men's expectations before investigation and&#xD;
      treatment of suspected coronary artery disease and to examine how these expectations are met.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Do women and men, of different ages, have the same expectations for the evaluation and&#xD;
      treatment of stable coronary artery disease and are their expectations met in a equal degree?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Are there differences in expectations and the fulfilment of these according to age and other&#xD;
      clinical history variables? Do the findings in the specially developed questionnaire designed&#xD;
      to gather patients' expectations to the outcome on quality of life and degree of angina&#xD;
      pectoris relate to their appearance in the designated forms? Is there a relationship between&#xD;
      NTproBNP - levels, as a measure of cardiac workload, and expectations and the fulfilment of&#xD;
      these as well as the quality of life and degree of angina pectoris?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Method: Patients will be asked to participate in the study, in the context of medical&#xD;
      consultation before coronary angiography by a physician and / or a study nurse. This occurs&#xD;
      during an outpatient visit at the cardiac clinic at the respective centre. Included are all&#xD;
      patients planned for elective coronary angiography before possible revascularization during a&#xD;
      eight month period regardless of diagnosis. Including are four hospitals in the region of&#xD;
      Västra Götaland.&#xD;

      Patients will be asked to participate in the study, in the context of medical consultation&#xD;
      before coronary angiography by a physician and / or a study nurse. This occurs during an&#xD;
      outpatient visit at the cardiac clinic at the respective centre.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Included are all patients planned for elective coronary angiography before possible&#xD;
      revascularization during a eight month period at SKAS, NÄL, SÄS and Sahlgrenska University&#xD;
      Hospital, this regardless of diagnosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient informed consent (attached appendix) is given to the patient before coronary&#xD;
      angiography at the out patient visit at the cardiac clinic at the respective centre, both&#xD;
      verbally and in writing by physician and/or nurse at the time of consultation about&#xD;
      participation in the study. At this time the approval is signed by concerned parties. This is&#xD;
      desired to be done only by a nurse as there is no intervention in the study. The patient has&#xD;
      to fill out three questionnaires at two occasions (but the 10 first patients included in the&#xD;
      reliability tests have to fill out the expectancy form a total of three times including&#xD;
      questions about the reliability of the questionnaire). The patient also has to leave two&#xD;
      additional blood samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients answer a questionnaire developed to measure the expectations of treatment and&#xD;
      questionnaires measuring quality of life and presence and degree of angina pectoris, (SF-36&#xD;
      and SAQ Seattle Angina Questionnaire). The form of expectations is validated against the&#xD;
      &quot;quality of life&quot; forms. Blood samples are taken at inclusion and again after six months and&#xD;
      are analyzed for NTproBNP, a biochemical measure of how much strain the coronary artery&#xD;
      disease puts on the heart muscle. We want to examine whether levels of NTproBNP before and&#xD;
      six months after coronary angiography correlates with quality of life and expectations before&#xD;
      the inquiry and to what extent the expectations are met. To ensure equal treatment, it is&#xD;
      important to build a patient perspective and set offered treatment and the availability of&#xD;
      this, in relation to the individual patient's expectations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following three instruments will be used to measure symptoms, functional limitation, and&#xD;
      expectations:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  SAQ (Seattle Angina Questionnaire) is primarily formulated to measure functional status&#xD;
           of patients with coronary artery disease. SAQ consists of 19 five-scale questions,&#xD;
           physical limitation (nine questions), angina grade (one question), frequency of angina&#xD;
           (two questions), satisfaction of treatment (two questions) and perception of disease&#xD;
           (five questions), and therefore measures dimensions of physical limitations, angina&#xD;
           degree, satisfaction of treatment and Perception of illness. The form takes about five&#xD;
           minutes to fill in. It is not a general measurement of quality of life (7).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  SF-36 partially consists of scales measuring physical function (10 questions), role&#xD;
           functioning-physical causes (four questions), role function-emotional reasons (three&#xD;
           questions), social functioning (two questions) and pain (two questions), It also&#xD;
           consists of scales for welfare, measuring mental health (five questions), vitality (four&#xD;
           questions), general health (five questions) and change in health (one question). This&#xD;
           instrument takes five-10 minutes to complete (8.9).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The Expectation Form is an own developed instrument consisting of a questionnaire with&#xD;
           11 questions about expectations for future care and treatment, and a follow-up&#xD;
           questionnaire six months later, to examine whether the expectations of the patient had&#xD;
           been met. The form takes about five minutes to fill in.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The form will be evaluated and validated as follows (10):&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Reliability-test will be done by four experienced professionals, knowledgeable in the&#xD;
           topic reviewing the questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The first 10 enrolled patients complete the questionnaire. This is made at an additional&#xD;
           occasion at the time of angiography. We do a 'test re-test, with about a week apart from&#xD;
           test to re-test. At this additional occasion patients will also answer questions about&#xD;
           how the questionnaire was to fill in i.e. a check of the user friendliness and on how&#xD;
           the understanding of the form was.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Validation of the form is done with SF-36, SAQ, and NTproBNP as the criteria. All data&#xD;
           are clinically relevant and should be recorded in the patient's medical record according&#xD;
           to standard procedures. Case Record Form (CRF) will be coded and anonymous, and a code&#xD;
           list will be stored at a research nurse at each, included hospital. Decoded CRF are sent&#xD;
           to and stored at Sahlgrenska University Hospital, at the department of Cardiology.&#xD;
           Processing and statistical data is coded and anonymous. The people managing the data are&#xD;
           those involved in the study as well as the cardiologist research unit's coordination&#xD;
           staff and monitoring staff.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethical issues must always be considered in studies where people with chronic and serious&#xD;
      illnesses are included. Requirements for information about the study and the opportunity to&#xD;
      connect with those responsible, respect for integrity and that none shall be harmed are&#xD;
      fundamental ethical principles that must be followed. Anonymity and confidentiality will be&#xD;
      guaranteed. It is also important to clarify the possibility of ending participation in the&#xD;
      study with no consequences for further care and treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Out of a privacy standpoint, there is a risk that the patient may feel exposed after filling&#xD;
      in the questionnaire relating to life situation, personal health and the relationship with&#xD;
      health care. We will be informing patients carefully about how we handle data and that no&#xD;
      data may be linked to individual patients when they are compiled and presented. data is&#xD;
      entered and managed via the Cardiology Research Unit, Sahlgrenska University Hospital. These&#xD;
      data are available to researchers participating in the study. The lead applicant is&#xD;
      responsible for data processing (with Statisticians) and is primarily responsible for the&#xD;
      report.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistic:Data processing and statistical analysis will be done in consultation with&#xD;
      statisticians. For about eight months, we expect, based on past experience, to be able to&#xD;
      include 800 consecutive patients undergoing elective coronary angiography at SKAS, NÄL, SÄS&#xD;
      and Sahlgrenska University hospital. Of these, about half is estimated to have coronary&#xD;
      artery disease and the rest of the surveys done as part of the investigation of other&#xD;
      cardiovascular disease as valvular disease or heart failure. The gender distribution is&#xD;
      estimated to be about 70% men and 30% women. Dichotomous variables (baseline characteristics)&#xD;
      are given in the frequency and compared between sexes with the chi 2 or Fisher's exact test&#xD;
      when appropriate. Continuous variables are presented as mean values with standard deviations&#xD;
      and compared by Student t-test. Comparisons between different age groups are made by ANOVA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Answer from the quality of life and degree of angina pectoris instruments, converted to&#xD;
      scores according to established schedules. Comparison of scores at baseline and six months&#xD;
      after the angiography will be done with paired Student t-test and between groups with two-way&#xD;
      ANOVA, or with non-parametric tests depending on the distribution of the data. The form of&#xD;
      expectations will be analyzed to answer each question using statistics as above. The study is&#xD;
      explorative why customary power calculation is not done. As indicated above, expected patient&#xD;
      material will be heterogeneous with respect to clinical condition, indication for&#xD;
      angiography, sex and age. It is therefore important to collect as many materials as possible&#xD;
      in order to compare different groups. Based on the SF 36 it can be stated that about 50&#xD;
      patients in each of two groups is needed if one is to detect differences in the range of five&#xD;
      points (total points of this instrument is often 45-50 depending on the patient group it is&#xD;
      about) with five-point standard deviation, 0.05 and power of 80%.&#xD;
