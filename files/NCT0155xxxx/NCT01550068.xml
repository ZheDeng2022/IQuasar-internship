      Acute rheumatic Fever (ARF) results from an autoimmune response due to molecular mimicry&#xD;
      between the M-protein on the group A β-hemolytic streptococci (GABHS) cell membrane and&#xD;
      cardiac myosin, and may lead through recurrent or sustained inflammation to Rheumatic Heart&#xD;
      Disease (RHD). RHD remains a major contributor to morbidity and premature death in the&#xD;
      working age population in Nepal. Secondary prevention with regular oral or intravenous&#xD;
      administration of penicillin continued until early adulthood is recommended to prevent the&#xD;
      progression of the development of endocarditis and subsequent valvular dysfunction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening for rheumatic heart disease using echocardiography has the potential to detect&#xD;
      rheumatic valvular lesions at an earlier, clinically silent stage, as compared to clinical&#xD;
      examination alone and might have a beneficial impact on long-term outcome of children with&#xD;
      RHD. Schoolchildren aged 5-16 years from several public and private schools from rural and&#xD;
      urban areas in Southeastern Nepal will be screened for RHD using portable echocardiography.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Three main inter-related objectives will be pursued in three phases of the study: In a first&#xD;
      phase using a cross sectional approach, the prevalence of clinical and subclinical RHD will&#xD;
      be investigated among a representative sample of schoolchildren from public and private&#xD;
      schools in urban and rural areas. In a second phase, using a cohort study approach among&#xD;
      those children diagnosed at different stages of RHD, clinical outcomes with regular medical&#xD;
      surveillance will be assessed (a), and clinical and social risk factors associated with&#xD;
      prognosis of the disease after receiving medical care at various stages of disease at&#xD;
      diagnosis will be determined (b). A third phase will integrate the prevalence rates from&#xD;
      phase 1 and the clinical outcomes from phase 2 in a mathematical model to assess the impact&#xD;
      of screening and RHD treatment on health resource utilization.&#xD;

      Background&#xD;
&#xD;
      Acute rheumatic Fever (ARF) results from an autoimmune response due to molecular mimicry&#xD;
      between the M-protein on the group A β-hemolytic streptococci (GABHS) cell membrane and&#xD;
      cardiac myosin, and may lead through recurrent or sustained inflammation to Rheumatic Heart&#xD;
      Disease (RHD) (1). RHD is reported to affect over 15 million people worldwide and remains a&#xD;
      major contributor to morbidity and premature death in the working age population in&#xD;
      developing countries (2). Socioeconomic determinants such as poverty, overcrowding, and&#xD;
      malnutrition have been related to RHD. The prevalence of ARF and RHD seems to be particularly&#xD;
      high in Southeast Asia, the Western Pacific and Africa (3). Whereas heart murmurs detected on&#xD;
      clinical examination may indicate clinically manifest RHD, echocardiographic screening&#xD;
      revealed ten times higher prevalence rates of RHD among schoolchildren (4) and may help&#xD;
      diagnose RHD at an earlier, &quot;clinically silent&quot; stage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with a past medical history of ARF or RHD are recommended secondary prevention with&#xD;
      regular oral or intravenous administration of penicillin continued until early adulthood.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Even though preventive measures with penicillin are inexpensive and efficient, this strategy&#xD;
      is difficult to effectuate in developing countries with limited access to health care&#xD;
      resources.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A recent study proved that enrolling patients with ARF and RHD in a registry with close&#xD;
      follow-up increases compliance to treatment and thus helps in reducing the cardiovascular&#xD;
      sequelae associated with disease progression (5).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The prevalence of RHD among schoolchildren in urban and rural areas in Nepal is largely&#xD;
      unknown, and risk factors associated with prognosis of the disease after receiving medical&#xD;
      care at various stages of disease at diagnosis need to be determined. Moreover, the impact of&#xD;
      screening using echocardiography, detecting RHD at an earlier, &quot;clinically silent&quot; stage of&#xD;
      RHD on health resource utilization has to be determined.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective&#xD;
&#xD;
      Originally, three main inter-related objectives were to be pursued in three phases of the&#xD;
      study: In the first phase using a cross sectional approach, the prevalence of clinical and&#xD;
      subclinical RHD were to be investigated among a representative sample of schoolchildren from&#xD;
      public and private schools in urban and rural areas. In the second phase, using a cohort&#xD;
      study approach among those children diagnosed at different stages of RHD, clinical outcomes&#xD;
      with regular medical surveillance were to be assessed (a), and clinical and social risk&#xD;
      factors associated with prognosis of the disease after receiving medical care at various&#xD;
      stages of disease at diagnosis were to be determined (b). A third phase was to integrate the&#xD;
      prevalence rates from phase 1 and the clinical outcomes from phase 2 in a mathematical model&#xD;
      to assess the impact of screening and RHD treatment on quality of life and health resource&#xD;
      utilization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On August 14 2013, the Nepal Health Research Council required the introduction of a control&#xD;
      group in the design of the Rheumatic Heart Disease (RHD) School Project. The original design&#xD;
      included a random sampling stratified by urban versus rural location and public versus&#xD;
      private status of schools, with a computer-generated random sequence used to determine which&#xD;
      schools would be centrally selected during Phase 1 of the project to undergo screening for&#xD;
      RHD. The original computer-generated random sequence was therefore used to determine which&#xD;
      schools would be randomly selected as control schools which did not undergo the screening&#xD;
      intervention during Phase 1, but would be selected for follow-up during Phase 2 of the&#xD;
      project. This approach implicitly allowed for a cluster randomized comparison between&#xD;
      intervention and control schools at follow-up in children aged 5 to 12 years at baseline,&#xD;
      when phase 1 of the study took place.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      The project will employ three types of study designs performed in sequential phases: a cross&#xD;
      sectional study (part 1), a longitudinal cohort study (part 2) and an analysis of the impact&#xD;
      of screening, secondary prevention and treatment on health resource utilization (part 3).&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Part 1: Cross-Sectional Survey Schoolchildren aged 5-16 years will be screened at&#xD;
           selected schools in the Southeast area of Nepal. A follow-up examination will be&#xD;
           performed in a subset of schools that underwent screening at baseline and in all control&#xD;
           schools, allowing for a cluster randomized comparison at follow-up between schools that&#xD;
           underwent screening at baseline and control schools in children aged 5 to 12 years at&#xD;
           baseline.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Part 2: Longitudinal Cohort Study Those children with documented history of ARF and/or&#xD;
           RHD will be included into a prospective registry and receive secondary prevention will&#xD;
           be followed on a regular basis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Part 3: Impact of Screening and Treatment of RHD The third phase will integrate the&#xD;
           prevalence rates from phase 1 and the clinical outcomes from phase 2 in a mathematical&#xD;
           model to assess the impact of screening and RHD treatment on health resource&#xD;
           utilization.&#xD;
