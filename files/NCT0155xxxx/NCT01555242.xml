      This is a phase I, open-label, multiple dose, dose escalation study to assess the safety,&#xD;
      tolerability and pharmacokinetics of Aneustat™ (OMN54), a novel therapy, administered orally&#xD;
      in patients with advanced cancer and lymphomas.&#xD;

      Patients who complete a 28-day cycle, may be eligible to continue receiving Aneustat™ (OMN54)&#xD;
      in 4-week increments for up to 6 cycles (inclusive of cycle 1) if further treatment is judged&#xD;
      to be of possible benefit; if patient has not experienced unacceptable toxicity; and no study&#xD;
      withdrawal criteria has been met.&#xD;
