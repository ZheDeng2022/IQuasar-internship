  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Doctors usually treat uveal melanoma with radiotherapy or surgery. But if this cancer&#xD;
      spreads, it is more difficult to treat.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Doctors usually treat uveal melanoma that has spread with a chemotherapy called dacarbazine,&#xD;
      but they are always looking to find new ways to treat uveal melanoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aims to find out how well Sunitinib works to treat uveal melanoma and to see how&#xD;
      long Sunitinib and Dacarbazine can help to prevent the cancer from getting worse.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      124 eligible patients will be randomised to either Sunitinib or Dacarbazine treatment.&#xD;
      Participants will then attend 3-weekly clinic visits and undergo 12-weekly tumour assessment&#xD;
      (CT or MRI scan) until disease progression (according to RECIST 1.1) has been identified.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At progression, patients may crossover to the other study treatment and continue with&#xD;
      3-weekly clinic visits and 12-weekly imaging until second progression.&#xD;

    <description>The primary outcome measure for this trial is the progression-free survival time measured from date of randomisation. For patients with evidence of progressive disease (as measured by CT scan, or MRI if necessary) or patients who have died from any cause, progression-free survival time will be calculated to date of progressive disease or date of death (whichever occurs first) and will be counted as events in the analysis. Patients still alive with no evidence of progression at the time of their last visit are censored at the time of the most recent information.</description>
