  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate echocardiographic markers of cardiac function to&#xD;
      assess the ability of patients to successfully end VA-ECMO support.&#xD;

      1. What is the major problem being addressed by this study?&#xD;
&#xD;
           Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) is a machine used to do the work of the heart&#xD;
           and lungs when children's hearts or lungs are too sick to perform normally.&#xD;
           Veno-arterial (VA) ECMO therapy for poor heart function provides support that can lead&#xD;
           to patient recovery, transplantation if appropriate and eligible, or complications of&#xD;
           ECMO therapy lead to stopping care. Each day a patient is on ECMO, complications can&#xD;
           occur that require stopping support, and attempting to get off ECMO as quickly as&#xD;
           possible is important. There is currently no consistent way of assessing heart function&#xD;
           while patients are supported by VA-ECMO to help guide when children's hearts have&#xD;
           improved enough to survive without the help of ECMO.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. What specific questions are you asking and how will you attempt to answer them?&#xD;
&#xD;
      The specific question we are asking is whether newer ultrasound measures of heart function&#xD;
      can predict which patient may be well enough to be able to come off of ECMO support. We are&#xD;
      following critically ill patients and performing multiple measurements at specific time&#xD;
      points to look for changes in those patients whose heart function recovers and in those&#xD;
      patients who do not recover function. The ultrasound measurements will be performed during&#xD;
      changes in the amount of support provided by the ECMO machine.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  3. What is the long-term biomedical significance of your work, particularly as it&#xD;
           pertains to the cardiovascular area? What major therapeutic advance(s) do you anticipate&#xD;
           that it will lead to? For instance, new drug(s), a surgical technique/procedure, a&#xD;
           diagnostic tool/test, a previously undetected risk factor, etc.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our long term goal is to develop non-invasive, quantitative measures of cardiac function for&#xD;
      patients needing ECMO support to help guide care. Ultimately if deemed successful, these&#xD;
      measurements could be used by all physicians who care for these patients. This study could&#xD;
      lead to more efficient prediction of who needs to stay on ECMO and who could be removed. This&#xD;
      could help to improve survival and decrease complications in some of the sickest children.&#xD;
      These measurements may also help us to identify, at an early stage, those patients whose&#xD;
      hearts are too sick to recover and will need a heart transplant evaluation.&#xD;
