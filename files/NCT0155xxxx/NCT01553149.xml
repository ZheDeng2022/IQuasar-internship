      This randomized phase II trial studies how well low-dose lenalidomide works compared with&#xD;
      high-dose lenalidomide in treating younger patients with juvenile pilocytic astrocytomas or&#xD;
      optic nerve pathway gliomas that have come back (recurrent), have not responded to treatment&#xD;
      (refractory), or are growing, spreading, or getting worse (progressive). Lenalidomide is&#xD;
      classified as an immunomodulatory drug as it boosts the immune system. It has other potential&#xD;
      anti-tumor effects, for example, it may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking blood flow&#xD;
      to the tumor. It is not yet known whether low-dose lenalidomide is more or less effective&#xD;
      than high-dose lenalidomide in treating patients with juvenile pilocytic astrocytomas or&#xD;
      optic nerve pathway gliomas.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the objective response rate in children with recurrent, refractory, or&#xD;
      progressive juvenile pilocytic astrocytomas and optic pathway gliomas who are treated with&#xD;
      Regimen A low-dose (20 mg/m^2/dose) or Regimen B high-dose (115 mg/m^2/dose) lenalidomide.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To estimate the event-free survival (EFS) (based on standard two-dimensional tumor&#xD;
      measurements, determined by each institution) of children with recurrent, refractory, or&#xD;
      progressive juvenile pilocytic astrocytomas and optic pathway gliomas who are treated with&#xD;
      lenalidomide.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To compare response categories and EFS across the 3 magnetic resonance (MR) sequences&#xD;
      (T2-weighted, fluid attenuated inversion recovery [FLAIR], T1-weighted post-contrast).&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To correlate steady-state pharmacokinetics of lenalidomide (1 sample obtained between&#xD;
      days 5-21) with objective response and EFS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To evaluate toxicities of long-term lenalidomide use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM I (Regimen A): Patients receive low-dose lenalidomide orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days&#xD;
      1-21. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 26 courses in the absence of disease&#xD;
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM II (Regimen B): Patients receive high-dose lenalidomide PO QD on days 1-21. Treatment&#xD;
      repeats every 28 days for up to 26 courses in the absence of disease progression or&#xD;
      unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up annually for approximately 3&#xD;
      years.&#xD;
