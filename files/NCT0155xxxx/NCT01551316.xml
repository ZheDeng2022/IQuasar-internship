  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In MediciNova's clinical development plan for MN-221, it was recognized that treatment of&#xD;
      COPD exacerbations may necessitate more than one single i.v. infusion and that patients in&#xD;
      this population may have more co-morbidities (and concomitant medications) than has been&#xD;
      generally studied so far. Thus, the primary objective of this clinical study is to determine&#xD;
      the repeated administration safety and tolerability of intravenous (i.v.) MN-221 compared to&#xD;
      placebo with repeated administration over several days in moderate to severe COPD patients&#xD;
      who may also have co-morbidities and concomitant medications (CM) common in this population.&#xD;
      Secondary outcomes include pharmacokinetics (PK) and preliminary efficacy (FEV1).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This Phase 1b trial follows naturally upon a Phase 1b COPD trial completed last year&#xD;
      (MN-221-CL-010) and is additionally well-supported by relevant animal safety data and human&#xD;
      clinical trial information.&#xD;
