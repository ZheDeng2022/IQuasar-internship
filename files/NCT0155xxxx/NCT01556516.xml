    <textblock>
      This study explores the outcome and effect of pregnancy on Pompe Disease. The results are&#xD;
      expected to guide clinicians in counseling and care of women with Pompe disease, who are&#xD;
      planning to become pregnant, and during the pregnancy.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Pompe disease (glycogen storage disease type II) is a lysosomal storage disorder resulting&#xD;
      from the deficiency of the enzyme acid alpha-glucosidase. Similar to many lysosomal storage&#xD;
      diseases, the phenotypic spectrum in Pompe disease is varied, existing in infantile, and&#xD;
      late-onset forms. In the classic infantile form, patients develop cardiomyopathy, resulting&#xD;
      in premature death. In the later-onset forms, there is proximal muscle weakness similar to&#xD;
      that of limb-girdle muscular dystrophy, which is associated with progressive weakness of&#xD;
      different muscle groups. The primary morbidity in Pompe disease is associated with&#xD;
      progressive respiratory insufficiency.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Events that act as metabolic stressors, in general, such as pregnancy may act as modifiers in&#xD;
      lysosomal storage disorders. In much studied Gaucher disease, pregnancy increased the risk of&#xD;
      acute bone crises, even in otherwise asymptomatic patients. However, similar studies lack for&#xD;
      Pompe disease. Most data that is used to counsel patients with Pompe disease are derived from&#xD;
      other muscular dystrophies, because obstetric risk and complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a retrospective case review study in female subjects age 18years and above. This&#xD;
      study investigates the effects of acid alpha-glucosidase deficiency on pregnancy, pregnancy&#xD;
      and disease outcomes in patients with adult-onset Pompe disease. The study will define the&#xD;
      immediate effect of enzyme replacement therapy with Lumizyme/Myozyme on the outcomes of&#xD;
      pregnancy and the fetus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be invited to participate through an initial mail or phone contact. If patient&#xD;
      is interested, and agrees to participate in the study the study questionnaire will be&#xD;
      provided to them. The patients then, need to complete the questionnaire, sign and date it and&#xD;
      mail it back along with a release of any medical information forms. The returned signed and&#xD;
      dated questionnaire from the patient serves as an indication of their consent to participate&#xD;
      in the study. Alternatively, study PI or coordinator may review the questionnaire with the&#xD;
      subject during a phone interview. However, the subject's signature is still required to&#xD;
      attest to participate in the study.&#xD;
