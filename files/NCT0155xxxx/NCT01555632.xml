    <textblock>
      This randomized pilot clinical trial studies atorvastatin calcium in preventing metabolic&#xD;
      syndrome in patients with prostate cancer receiving long-term androgen-deprivation therapy.&#xD;
      Atorvastatin calcium may help prevent or reduce metabolic syndrome caused by long-term&#xD;
      androgen-deprivation therapy&#xD;
    </textblock>

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate in a pilot study a preliminary estimate of the overall change of metabolic&#xD;
      syndrome score in men undergoing or who have undergone androgen-deprivation therapy for&#xD;
      treatment or the control of prostate cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To assess the effectiveness of Atorvastatin (atorvastatin calcium) on the prevention of&#xD;
      metabolic syndrome in men undergoing or who have undergone androgen-deprivation therapy for&#xD;
      treatment or the control of prostate cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To document the safety and tolerability of Atorvastatin in this patient population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To assess the impact of Atorvastatin on mean change in prostate specific antigen (PSA)&#xD;
      and PSA velocity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. The collection and banking of blood and serum on subjects for future analysis that will&#xD;
      be proposed in future institutional review board (IRB) submissions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM I: Patients receive placebo orally once daily for 6 months in the absence of disease&#xD;
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM II: Patients receive atorvastatin calcium orally once daily for 6 months in the absence&#xD;
      of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days, and at 6 months&#xD;
      thereafter.&#xD;

    <measure>Overall change of metabolic syndrome score (divided into 6 groups according to the number of constituents [0-5] of metabolic syndrome)</measure>
    <time_frame>At 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>A total of 60 subjects will yield 80% power at the 0.05 two-sided level of significance to detect 3.40 difference of the mean change in metabolic syndrome scores after 6 months between arms using a Mann-Whitney test.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Safety and tolerability of atorvastatin calcium</measure>
    <time_frame>Adverse Events (AE) at 3 and 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Safety will be assessed when approx 30 patients (50%) have completed the 3 month assessment based on the frequency and % of adverse events. 5 patients experiencing any non-hematologic, non-androgen deprivation related grade 3 or greater AE would trigger a systematic review of the AE experience. The frequency of AEs will be compared between the placebo and Atorvastatin groups using a Fisher's Exact test. A p-value of 0.20 will be considered significant for the interim assessment.</description>
