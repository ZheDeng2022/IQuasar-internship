      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomized trials show improved outcomes among acute coronary syndrome (ACS) patients treated&#xD;
      with Bivalirudin1. Optimal antithrombotic treatment in patients undergoing percutaneous&#xD;
      coronary intervention (PCI) is crucial to balance the risk of post-PCI bleeding versus&#xD;
      ischemic complications2. Bivalirudin, a direct thrombin inhibitor has been extensively&#xD;
      investigated as an intra-procedural antithrombotic therapy in patients with stable angina,&#xD;
      Non ST-segment elevation acute coronary syndrome (NSTE-ACS), and ST-segment elevation&#xD;
      myocardial infarction (STEMI). Bivalirudin, when used with or without glycoprotein IIb/IIIa&#xD;
      inhibitors (GPI) during PCI has been found to be superior to Unfractionated heparin (UFH)&#xD;
      with or without GPI in reducing 30-day bleeding complications without significant increase in&#xD;
      the rate of ischemic events3-5.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Moreover,after otherwise successful PCI,an increase in cardiac biomarkers has been shown to&#xD;
      occur in 5% to 30% of patients6. Recent studies have focused their attention onthe reduction&#xD;
      of infarct size and the incidence of periprocedural (type IVa) myocardial infarction&#xD;
      (PMI)after elective PCI7-8. Therefore, we will perform a single-center, prospective and&#xD;
      randomized study to assess if Bivalirudin versus UFHis effective in preventing elevation of&#xD;
      biomarkers of MI after coronary stent implantation in patients already treated with aspirin&#xD;
      and clopidogrel,with anatomically complex lesion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      to assess the safety and efficacy of routine usage of the Bivalirudin vs UFH in patients with&#xD;
      coronary artery disease (CAD), after stent implantation in coronary long lesions, to avoid&#xD;
      periprocedural myocardial necrosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Setting:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Single-center, spontaneous, prospective, randomized 1:1 study of Bivalirudin infusion vs UFH&#xD;
      in the setting of CAD, after PCI with stenting incoronary long lesions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Comparison: Bivalirudin vs UFH, in preventing elevation of biomarkers of MI after coronary&#xD;
      stent implantation in patients already treated with aspirin and clopidogrel, with&#xD;
      anatomically complex lesion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Population:Patients with diffuse CAD undergoing percutaneous treatment on a native coronary&#xD;
      vessel with planned implantation stents in overlapping with a total stent length &gt;33 mm for&#xD;
      long coronary lesions in vessels with a reference vessel diameter 2.25-4.0 mm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessment Following the procedure, blood samples for CK, CK-MB and Troponin will be&#xD;
      collected at 6,12 and 24 h post PCI. CK-MB values will be considered abnormal if they will&#xD;
      elevate above the upper limit of normal (ULN). This is set at 6 mg/L by our local laboratory.&#xD;
      If the first blood sample showed a CK-MB level ≥18 mg/L (≥3 times upper normal limit), a&#xD;
      second blood sample would be drawn every 8 h later until a downward trend will be observed.&#xD;
      For patients with two or more blood samples drawn, the peak CK-MB level will be used for&#xD;
      analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      End-points:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary end-point of this study will be the incidence of periprocedural myonecrosis that&#xD;
      was defined as a peak post-procedural CK-MB elevation &gt; 1 time the upper limit of normal&#xD;
      (ULN) alone or associated with chest pain or ST-segment or T-wave abnormalities, in patients&#xD;
      undergoing non-urgent PCI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary end-points will be the rate of MACCE (major adverse cerebro-cardiovascular events,&#xD;
      ie the composite of death, myocardial infarction [defined according to the Academic Research&#xD;
      Consortium statement], target vessel revascularization or stroke), the rate of major&#xD;
      bleedings (Bleeding Academic Consortium [BARC] 3-5), minor bleedings (BARC 2), and the rate&#xD;
      of NACE (net adverse clinical events, ie the composite of MACCE and major bleedings) at 30&#xD;
      days, 6 and 12 month follow-up. Adverse events will be determined by telephone interview&#xD;
      and/or medical record review. Clinical follow-up: telephone-based interviews and office-based&#xD;
      direct visits will be performed at 1, 6 and 12 months, respectively, for end-point&#xD;
      adjudication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size and statistical analysis: Given an expected rate of abnormal post-procedural peak&#xD;
      CK-MB &gt; 1 x ULM of 48% (based on results of the INSTANT trial) for the control group and 29%&#xD;
      for the experimental group (thus a 40% relative risk reduction), aiming for a 0.05 alpha and&#xD;
      0.80 power, a total of 204 patients will need to be enrolled (102 patients per group).&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:Clinical Inclusion Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
        Candidates for this study must meet all of the following criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Male or female able to understand and sign a witnessed informed consent&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age ≥ 18 yo&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with stable (CCS 1-4) or unstable angina pectoris (but with the most recent&#xD;
             anginal episode occurring &gt;48 hours before the index procedure) or documented silent&#xD;
             ischemia&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ongoing or recent episode (&lt;48 hours) of unstable coronary artery disease (including&#xD;
             non-ST-elevation acute coronary syndromes)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Stable Hemodynamic conditions (systolic BP &gt; 100 HR &gt; 40 &lt; 100).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  No clinical and ECG changes suggestive of ongoing acute or recent (&lt;48 hours)&#xD;
             myocardial infarction.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Angiographic inclusion criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Angiographic evidence of a de novo lesion &gt; 50% requiring implantation of two stents&#xD;
             in overlapping with a total stent length&gt; 33 mm and reference vessel diameter between&#xD;
             2.5 and 4.0 mm (by visual estimation) in one coronary vessel. Multiple lesions in the&#xD;
             same vessels can be included but at least one lesion should require implantation of&#xD;
             two stents in overlapping with a total stent length &gt; 33 mm. The definition of&#xD;
             multivessel disease requires an intention to treat at least two lesions (with a least&#xD;
             one with the characteristics reported above) in two different major epicardial&#xD;
             segments. For example, the presence of a lesion in the left anterior descending artery&#xD;
             and in the obtuse marginal or the presence of a lesions in the right postero-lateral&#xD;
             branch and in a diagonal branch will qualify as multivessel. The presence of lesions&#xD;
             in the left anterior descending artery and in the diagonal branch will not qualify as&#xD;
             multivessel. Bifurcation lesions and ostial lesions can be included, but only if at&#xD;
             least two stent in overlapping with a total stent length &gt; 33 mm are implanted in the&#xD;
             same branch. When treating diffuse lesion in the same vessel, overlapping stenting is&#xD;
             recommended with high pressure (&gt;14 atm post-dilation) of the overlap zone. There is&#xD;
             no maximum stent length to treat one coronary vessel.&#xD;
