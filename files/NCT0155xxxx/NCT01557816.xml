    <textblock>
      This study aims to evaluate various methods of measuring pain relief in subjects who have&#xD;
      chronic OA of the knee. After a 1 week of wash-out from existing therapy, subjects will be&#xD;
      treated in a blinded fashion for 1 week with either naproxen (3 days at 250 mg twice a day&#xD;
      followed by 4 days at 500 mg twice a day) or placebo. After the first week of treatment,&#xD;
      subjects will have another week of wash-out followed by a second period of 1 week of the&#xD;
      alternate treatment. Subjects will not be allowed to use oral non-steroidal anti-inflammatory&#xD;
      drugs (NSAIDs) or other oral analgesics, or topical medications on their target knees during&#xD;
      the study. Acetaminophen will be allowed as a rescue medication.&#xD;

      This study aims to evaluate various methods of measuring pain relief in osteoarthritis (OA)&#xD;
      of the knee. The duration of the study will be up to 5 weeks. Eligible subjects will have&#xD;
      chronic OA of the knee. After meeting initial entry criteria and prior to randomization,&#xD;
      there will be a 1 week wash-out from existing therapy. Subjects will then be treated in a&#xD;
      blinded fashion for 1 week with either naproxen (3 days at 250 mg twice a day followed by 4&#xD;
      days at 500 mg twice a day) or placebo. After the first week of treatment, subjects will have&#xD;
      a week of wash-out followed by a second period of 1 week of the alternate treatment. Subjects&#xD;
      will not be allowed to use oral non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) or other oral&#xD;
      analgesics, nor will they be allowed to use topical medications on their target knees during&#xD;
      the study. Acetaminophen will be allowed as a rescue medication (as needed up to 2 g/day)but&#xD;
      subjects will be told not to take acetaminophen at least 12 hours before study visits.&#xD;
      Seventy (70) subjects will be randomized to ensure that 60 subjects complete both treatment&#xD;
      arms.&#xD;
