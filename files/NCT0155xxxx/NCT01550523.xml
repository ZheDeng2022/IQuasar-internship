  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This human Phase I trial involves taking the patient's own tumor cells during surgical&#xD;
      craniotomy, treating them with an investigational new drug (an antisense molecule) designed&#xD;
      to shut down a targeted surface receptor protein, and re-implanting the cells, now&#xD;
      encapsulated in small diffusion chambers the size of a dime in the patient's abdomen within&#xD;
      24 hours after the surgery. Loss of the surface receptor causes the tumor cells to die in a&#xD;
      process called apoptosis. As the tumor cells die, they release small particles called&#xD;
      exosomes, each full of tumor antigens. It is believed that these exosomes as well as the&#xD;
      presence of the antisense molecule work together to activate the immune system against the&#xD;
      tumor as they slowly diffuse out of the chamber. This combination product therefore serves as&#xD;
      a slow-release antigen depot. Immune cells are immediately available for activation outside&#xD;
      of the chamber because a wound was created to implant these tumor cells and a foreign body&#xD;
      (the chamber) is present in the wound. The wound and the chamber fortify the initial immune&#xD;
      response which eventually leads to the activation of immune system T cells that attack and&#xD;
      eliminate the tumor. By training the immune system to recognize the tumor, the patient is&#xD;
      also protected through immune surveillance from later tumor growth should the tumor recur.&#xD;
      Compared to the other immunotherapy strategies, this treatment marshalls the native immune&#xD;
      system (specifically the antigen presenting cells, or dendritic cells) rather than&#xD;
      engineering the differentiation of these immune cells and re-injecting them. Compared to&#xD;
      traditional treatment alternatives for tumor recurrence, including a boost of further&#xD;
      radiation and more chemotherapy, this treatment represents potentially greater benefit with&#xD;
      fewer risks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This combination product serves as a therapeutic vaccine with an acceptable safety profile,&#xD;
      which activates an anti-tumor adaptive immune response resulting in radiographic tumor&#xD;
      regression.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This trial will be an adaptation and continuation of a previously published trial,&#xD;
      reproducing the original study size of 12 patients. Modifications from the previous trial&#xD;
      include a modified oligodeoxynucleotide sequence and treatment at initial diagnosis, which&#xD;
      would occur with concomitant standard therapy in an additional Phase 1 trial as a&#xD;
      continuation if no rate-limiting toxicity is noted in the original Phase 1 arm. For practical&#xD;
      purposes, a standard Phase 1 dose-escalation study is not possible with the current paradigm.&#xD;
      Although we may have identified a distinct bioactive byproduct of IGF-1R/AS ODN-induced tumor&#xD;
      cell apoptosis (exosomes), it is difficult to perform a dose escalation in a typical fashion.&#xD;
      Also, antigen concentration can affect immune response in a biphasic manner: too little or&#xD;
      too much can dampen an immune response, so even if the antigen or antigens were known, a&#xD;
      typical pharmacologic dose escalation would not follow typical pharmacokinetics. For these&#xD;
      reasons, we have designed a follow-on Phase 1 arm in which 32 patients will have therapy at&#xD;
      initial surgery in 4 cohorts of 8 patients each. We will vary chamber number and implantation&#xD;
      duration for each of the four cohorts in the additional Phase 1 arm. When we documented an&#xD;
      increase in tumor infiltrating lymphocytes after treatment in our original trial, this&#xD;
      observation provided preliminary supporting evidence that this therapeutic vaccine will&#xD;
      elicit an adaptive immune response. We have designed the Phase 1 arm to further elucidate an&#xD;
      immune response with a quantitative assessment of tumor specific T cells as well as&#xD;
      circulating M2 macrophages before and after treatment. The design of the Phase 1 phase of the&#xD;
      trial will allow a statistical analysis of both antigen dose (number of chambers) and time of&#xD;
      exposure (chamber dwell time) as either variable may relate to any toxicity or treatment&#xD;
      response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A summary of the treatment paradigm includes: Pre-operative plasma leukopheresis, then&#xD;
      surgery with tissue harvest and implantation of up to 10 chambers in the rectus sheath with&#xD;
      IGF-1R/AS ODN as previously reported within 24 hours of craniotomy plus one chamber&#xD;
      containing only phosphate buffered saline. Twelve patients treated for recurrent disease will&#xD;
      be assessed for safety of the treatment. If the safety profile is acceptable, the trial will&#xD;
      be followed by accrual of 32 patients in an additional Phase 1 trial as a continuation over&#xD;
      approximately 3 years prospectively from Thomas Jefferson University Hospital and the&#xD;
      Jefferson Hospital for Neuroscience. All patients who meet the eligibility criteria and agree&#xD;
      to participate in this study will be potential candidates for therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pre-Operative Preparation - Patients will consent to a plasma leukopheresis at least 3 days&#xD;
      prior to elective craniotomy. The PBMC will be stored for subsequent analysis of T cell&#xD;
      responses, the presence of IL-10-producing M2 macrophages, and dendritic cell (DC)&#xD;
      preparation. ELISPOT assays will be performed to measure T cell responses to autologous tumor&#xD;
      cells and allogeneic tumor cells (U118 tumor lysate) utilizing cross-primed DC to assess both&#xD;
      native anti-glioma immunity any acquired immunity after treatment. If U118 allogeneic glioma&#xD;
      cells elicit a CTL response, this cell line may serve as an antigen source for future serial&#xD;
      vaccination protocols.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A pre-operative PET scan as a baseline against which we can compare post-treatment PET scans&#xD;
      as indicated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Surgery and Tumor Cell Retrieval - Craniotomy and MRI-based image guided tumor resection will&#xD;
      be performed on all study patients by an experienced neurosurgeon . All tested malignant&#xD;
      gliomas obtained from craniotomies performed at Thomas Jefferson University have expressed&#xD;
      the IGF-1R (M. Resnicoff, personal communication). During resection, viable tumor tissue will&#xD;
      be confirmed by pathologic examination of frozen sections, and then sent to a BL-2 facility&#xD;
      for disaggregation and plating in culture. Permanent section analysis will include an IGF-1R&#xD;
      immunostain to determine the presence of IGF-1R. Once the cells are attached, cells will&#xD;
      immediately be treated with IGF-1R/AS ODN. Tumor cells will be incubated with IGF-1R/AS ODN&#xD;
      for a maximum of 6 hours and 106 cells will be then be loaded into each chamber and a target&#xD;
      maximum of 10 chambers prepared. For all combination lot productions, two additional&#xD;
      irradiated chambers and 300 ul of treated autologous tumor cells will be sent to microbiology&#xD;
      for assessment of sterility according to FDA requirements. Greater than 5 and less than 10&#xD;
      chambers will be scored as a minor protocol violation. Recovery of no viable cells will be&#xD;
      grounds for disenrollment from the protocol. Prior to implantation, the chambers will be&#xD;
      irradiated with 5 Gy of X-irradiation as previously described. An additional tumor sample&#xD;
      will be flash-frozen for exploratory research objectives. At the time of craniotomy the&#xD;
      surgeon will create an abdominal acceptor site for subsequent diffusion chamber implantation&#xD;
      in the rectus sheath. This implantation site was chosen for the following reasons: (1) it&#xD;
      yielded objective favorable biological responses in the prior human Phase 1 trial; (2) this&#xD;
      site will easily accommodate multiple chamber implantations; (3) this site should elicit a&#xD;
      strong host response due to the extent of the wound, the introduction of a foreign body and&#xD;
      its contents, the vasculature of the rectus sheath and muscle, and the favorable inguinal&#xD;
      node lymphatic drainage from this site; and (4) exposure of the rectus sheath and muscle is&#xD;
      familiar to neurosurgeons all of whom commonly perform ventricular-peritoneal shunts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Biodiffusion Chamber Implantation/Explantation - Autologous tumor cell preparation,&#xD;
      encapsulation in the biodiffusion chambers, irradiation, and chamber&#xD;
      implantation/explantation are all procedures detailed in the Standard Operating Procedures&#xD;
      Manual for IND #14379 (SOP 001). Briefly, at bedside in the intensive care unit the patient&#xD;
      is sedated with intravenous Midazolam (Versed, 0.05 mg/kg repeated every 2 - 3 minutes to&#xD;
      adequate sedation up to a maximum dose of 0.2mg/kg) and and Fentanyl (Sublimaze, 5mg which&#xD;
      may be repeated every 5 minutes to a maximum dose of 20mg) and the wound infiltrated with up&#xD;
      to 30 cc of 0.5% bupivicaine. With appropriate local anesthesia and sedation, the wound&#xD;
      prepared at surgery is re-opened through the rectus sheath and up to 10 chambers are&#xD;
      implanted between the rectus sheath and rectus muscle. The sheath is then re-approximated&#xD;
      with 2-0 vicryl sutures and the skin re-approximated with 3-0 nylon sutures.The 24 hour&#xD;
      period of implantation was chosen based on the favorable safety profile and promising&#xD;
      biological responses noted in the previous human Phase 1 trial. Explantation involves the&#xD;
      same process the following day with chamber explantation and a four layer wound closure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up MRI imaging schedule The MRI studies at days 28 and 56 are acknowledged as not&#xD;
      being done as standard of care because they would not reflect meaningful clinical data if&#xD;
      patients received only standard of care treatment. The first surveillance MRIs are usually&#xD;
      obtained around 3 months after surgery or other interventions such as radiation or&#xD;
      chemotherapy. After this experimental treatment, however, we anticipate radiographic&#xD;
      responses much earlier as documented in the prior human trial. In the prior trial, partial or&#xD;
      complete radiographic responses were documented anywhere from 2 to 27 weeks after treatment.&#xD;
      We interpret these early responses to be a reflection of an immune-mediated biological&#xD;
      response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up PET imaging schedule PET scans are scheduled at the discretion of the investigator&#xD;
      to confirm disease progression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Retreatment of Subjects will be considered for an anticipated subgroup of subjects initially&#xD;
      participating in this protocol who have demonstrated immunocompetent responses associated&#xD;
      with objective clinical and radiographic improvements after induction vaccination.&#xD;
      Specifically, if serial assessments of T cell numbers and associated inflammatory cytokines,&#xD;
      interferon, the INF-responsive cytokines CXCL9, CXCL10, and interleukin 6 are significantly&#xD;
      elevated and associated with clinical and radiographic improvement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects entering the retreatment phase of the protocol will follow the same treatment plan&#xD;
      with the exception of pre-operative plasma leukopheresis. Plasma leukopheresis previously&#xD;
      collected will be utilized.&#xD;
