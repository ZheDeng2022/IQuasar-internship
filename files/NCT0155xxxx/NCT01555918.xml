      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the pharmacokinetic properties of isavuconazole&#xD;
      (BAL4815) and the cleavage product (BAL8728) and assess the safety and tolerability after&#xD;
      single-dose and steady state (multiple-dose) administration of isavuconazole BAL8557 in&#xD;
      healthy Chinese subjects.&#xD;

      This is a two part study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 1: On Day 1, Period 1, subjects will receive a single dose of isavuconazole orally or&#xD;
      intravenously according to the treatment sequence allocation. Subjects will remain resident&#xD;
      in the unit in order to collect blood for pharmacokinetics (PK) and to assess the safety&#xD;
      tests. They will be released in the morning of Day 15 after collection of blood for safety&#xD;
      tests. Subjects will have a washout period of 2 weeks returning to the unit for Day -1 of&#xD;
      Period 2 (Day 29). Subjects will receive a single dose of isavuconazole orally or&#xD;
      intravenously (opposite mode of administration from Period 1). Subjects will remain resident&#xD;
      in the unit and will be released in the morning of Day 15, Period 2 (Day 44) after collection&#xD;
      of blood for tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 2: Subjects will be allocated to multiple intravenous (IV) (Group 1) or oral (Group 2)&#xD;
      dosing. On Day 1, Group 1 will receive multiple intravenous (IV) dosing of isavuconazole as a&#xD;
      2-hour infusion, three times a day (TID) with 8 hours between doses for 2 days followed by&#xD;
      isavuconazole as a 2-hour infusion every day (QD) for 10 days. Group 2 will receive multiple&#xD;
      oral (PO) dosing of isavuconazole TID with 8 hours between doses for 2 days followed by&#xD;
      isavuconazole PO QD for 10 days. Subjects in Group 1 and 2 will remain resident in the unit&#xD;
      in order to collect blood and urine for PK evaluations and to assess the safety tests. They&#xD;
      will be released in the morning of Day 26 after collection of blood for tests.&#xD;
