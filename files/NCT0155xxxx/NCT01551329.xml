    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of ketamine in reducing depressive&#xD;
      symptoms in subjects with a comorbid major depressive episode and alcohol dependence. The&#xD;
      investigators hypothesize the following for the present study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A single dose of ketamine will induce a rapid, robust and sustained reduction in depressive&#xD;
      symptoms in subjects with a comorbid major depressive episode and alcohol dependence relative&#xD;
      to placebo as defined by change in Hamilton Depression Rating Scale total scores at 72 hours&#xD;
      post infusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A single dose of ketamine can be delivered safely, with minimal adverse events or&#xD;
      complications, in subjects with a comorbid major depressive episode and alcohol dependence.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Major depression and alcohol dependence are both within the ten disorders for highest&#xD;
      worldwide disease burden as identified by the World Health Organization (WHO), and these&#xD;
      disorders frequently co-occur, especially in high-service utilizing patients with severe and&#xD;
      persistent mental illness. Currently available treatments are inadequate for both chronic&#xD;
      conditions alone, and the inadequacy is even clearer in people meeting criteria for both&#xD;
      disorders. Ketamine was first reported as a rapidly-acting antidepressant in 2000 via&#xD;
      research occurring at Yale, and, since that time, in several small randomized controlled&#xD;
      trials, a single subanesthetic dose of intravenous ketamine has demonstrated efficacy in&#xD;
      improving mood in unipolar and bipolar depression within only hours after administration.&#xD;
      These effects can last at least a week. Interestingly, ketamine has been demonstrated to&#xD;
      produce a more robust effect in treatment-refractory unipolar depressed subjects with a&#xD;
      family history of alcoholism relative to similarly difficult-to-treat subjects without a&#xD;
      family history of alcohol problems. In addition, recently-detoxified alcoholics have been&#xD;
      safely administered subanesthetic doses of ketamine, and, during these infusions, alcoholics&#xD;
      (and even those with only a family history of alcoholism) displayed a differential response&#xD;
      to ketamine, e.g. blunted psychotic-like and cognitive effects, relative to healthy controls.&#xD;
      Therefore, ketamine may reduce depressive symptoms and alcohol consumption compared to&#xD;
      placebo in patients with comorbid major depression and current alcohol dependence. Positive&#xD;
      results will mark a major advance in the clinical care of those being treated for both&#xD;
      conditions and will open the door for further scientific investigations into the clinical&#xD;
      neuroscience of these highly comorbid and prevalent conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a two phase, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, cross-over,&#xD;
      proof-of-concept study designed to determine the effects of a single dose of ketamine,&#xD;
      administered IV, on mood and alcohol consumption, in psychotropic medication-free patients&#xD;
      meeting DSM-IV-TR criteria for a major depressive episode (MDE) and current alcohol&#xD;
      dependence. Participants will be assigned randomly to receive either intravenous ketamine&#xD;
      (0.5mg/kg) or saline solution 2 weeks apart in a cross over design. The ketamine dose was&#xD;
      based on previous studies in patients with depression and bipolar disorder. A team member&#xD;
      experienced with ketamine infusions will administer the study medication over a 40-minute&#xD;
      infusion in a blinded fashion at the Biological Studies Unit at the WHVA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      20 depressed alcohol dependent subjects between the ages of 21-65 will be recruited for this&#xD;
      study through advertising and the West Haven VA clinics. Subjects will complete an informed&#xD;
      consent process and will be thoroughly screened for inclusion and exclusion criteria as&#xD;
      described below. Individuals will be given a post consent test to evaluate their&#xD;
      understanding of the procedure. For subjects who provide incorrect answers to any of the test&#xD;
      items, the research staff will review the correct answers with the subject and show the&#xD;
      subject where the correct answers are found in the consent form. Those who get more than 60%&#xD;
      of the questions wrong and are still unable to understand the procedure after reviewing it&#xD;
      with the research staff will be excluded from the study. They will be referred to appropriate&#xD;
      resources for outpatient treatment of their depression and alcoholism. Before start of the&#xD;
      study all patients will be free of any psychotropic medications.&#xD;
