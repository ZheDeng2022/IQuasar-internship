  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer mortality worldwide and in the U.K alone; there&#xD;
      are 38,000 new cases of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) a year. The new treatment being&#xD;
      tested in this study is called pembrolizumab, this is a type of immunotherapy, which works by&#xD;
      stimulating the body's own immune system to fight cancer cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pembrolizumab blocks a protein on the T-cell surface (one of the cells of the immune system),&#xD;
      which then triggers the cell to find and kill cancer cells. This will be given with&#xD;
      radiotherapy to see if this combination is safe and effective at treating patients with&#xD;
      non-small cell lung cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pembrolizumab has proved to be a safe and effective treatment for other cancers such as&#xD;
      melanoma and lung cancer. Radiotherapy is often given as standard treatment to treat lung&#xD;
      cancer, and is proven to be a safe and tolerable treatment. However, the safety of the&#xD;
      combination of Pembrolizumab and thoracic radiotherapy delivered concurrently has not been&#xD;
      tested yet prospectively&#xD;

    <description>Pembrolizumab is given by intravenous infusion over 30 minutes at a maximum dose of 200mg. The first dose of pembrolizumab is administered 14 days prior to the initiation of radiotherapy and every 3 weeks thereafter. Radiotherapy is given as a standard dose (60-66 Gy in 2 Gy/fraction) over 40-45 days (daily on Mon-Fri) Following completion of radiotherapy, participants will continue to receive pembrolizumab every 3 weeks for up to 12 months of maintenance treatment.</description>
