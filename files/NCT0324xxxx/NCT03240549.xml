      Previous studies have shown that the addition of bevacizumab to the standard first-line&#xD;
      platinum-based combination therapy can improve the objective response rate of patients with&#xD;
      advanced non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer by 20% to 28% and improve survival. Data&#xD;
      from these published literatures suggest that the improvement in objective response rates is&#xD;
      due mainly to patients with stable disease of chemotherapy. It has been reported that 15% of&#xD;
      patients achieved objective remission after continuing treatment with the regimen after&#xD;
      receiving 2 cycles of platinum-based combination chemotherapy. Therefore, the use of 2 cycles&#xD;
      of chemotherapy after stabilization of patients with bevacizumab, hoping to improve the&#xD;
      objective response rate of such patients 20%, and may improve survival. For the above&#xD;
      reasons, design this study to validate our hypothesis.&#xD;

      Previous studies have shown that the addition of bevacizumab to the standard first-line&#xD;
      platinum-based combination therapy can improve the objective response rate of patients with&#xD;
      advanced non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer by 20% to 28% and improve survival. Data&#xD;
      from these published literatures suggest that the improvement in objective response rates is&#xD;
      due mainly to patients with stable disease of chemotherapy. It has been reported that 15% of&#xD;
      patients achieved objective remission after continuing treatment with the regimen after&#xD;
      receiving 2 cycles of platinum-based combination chemotherapy. Therefore, the use of 2 cycles&#xD;
      of chemotherapy after stabilization of patients with bevacizumab, hoping to improve the&#xD;
      objective response rate of such patients 20%, and may improve survival. For the above&#xD;
      reasons, design this study to validate our hypothesis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      So a prospective cohort study has been designed to confirm this hypothesis, patients with&#xD;
      advanced pulmonary adenocarcinoma who are stable after two cycles of platinum-based&#xD;
      combination chemotherapy are objects of this study, and they can choose to continue the&#xD;
      previous treatment regimen according to the guideline or adding bevacizumab to the regimen&#xD;
      independently until the progression or intolerance of toxicity, or 4 to 6 cycles of&#xD;
      chemotherapy in stable disease. The objective response rate in these two groups who received&#xD;
      different treatment is the primary endpoint and the toxicity, quality of life, the&#xD;
      progression free survival are the second endpoints.&#xD;
