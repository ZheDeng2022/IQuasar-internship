  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Acute heart failure (AHF) is a frequent condition in emergency basis and is responsible of a&#xD;
      big number of admissions, complications, and deaths.&#xD;
&#xD;
      despite advances in diagnostic techniques, AHF diagnosis still difficult and cost not&#xD;
      effective.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measurement of cardiac output (CO) is used as a way to evaluate global cardiac function and&#xD;
      changes in CO may be used to identify a change in the hemodynamic status of a patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      the gold standard of measuring CO is thermodilution catheterization, however this is an&#xD;
      invasive technique that poses a risk to the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Impedance cardiography (ICG) is a noninvasive method for measuring CO. it is performed by&#xD;
      applying small electrical current to the chest, and through electrodes placed on the neck and&#xD;
      sides.&#xD;
&#xD;
      the pulsatile flow of blood causes fluctuations in the current, and the device calculates CO&#xD;
      from the impedance waveform.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In practice, the investigators connect the device &quot;BIOPAC&quot; by using four electrodes which the&#xD;
      investigators place on the base of the neck (posterior face) and on the base of the thorax&#xD;
      (posterior face).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The ECG recording is taken simultaneously with two other electrodes placed at the right upper&#xD;
      limb and left lower limb.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to detecting the electric current and the ECG, heart sounds are recorded using a&#xD;
      sensor that is placed at the mitral site.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The various curves are displayed simultaneously and stored for analysis. Subjects were first&#xD;
      placed in the semi sitting position 30°, and after 5 minutes had cardiac output measurements&#xD;
      performed. (CO1)&#xD;
&#xD;
      A second cardiac output measurement was performed after 5 min of seated position. (C02)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients were then placed in the initial position, and after an additional 5 minutes had&#xD;
      cardiac output measurements performed. (CO1')&#xD;
&#xD;
      A third set of measurement was obtained during 45° passive leg raising at 1 to 2&#xD;
      minutes.(CO3)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients were then placed in the initial position, and after an additional 5 minutes had&#xD;
      cardiac output measurements performed. (CO1'')&#xD;
&#xD;
      During a Valsalva maneuver the investigators took the fourth cardiac output measurement.&#xD;
      (CO4)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients were then placed in the initial position, and after an additional 5 minutes had&#xD;
      cardiac output measurements performed. (CO1''')&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dynamic variations on bio-impedance measured CO using non pharmacologic intervention (sitting&#xD;
      position, passive leg rising and Valsalva maneuver) could be used to detect AHF in patients&#xD;
      admitted to the ED for dyspnea.&#xD;
