  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will test prucalopride (a prokinetic drug currently approved by Health Canada for&#xD;
      treatment of constipation) as a treatment for Ineffective Esophageal Motility (IEM). Adult&#xD;
      patients with previously diagnosed IEM will be invited to participate by the investigators.&#xD;
      The participants will take the study medication for 5 days and on the final day of medication&#xD;
      undergo an esophageal manometry procedure at the Calgary Gut Motility Centre to measure&#xD;
      esophageal function. Symptoms and side effects will be tracked at baseline and on Day 5.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      As part of the standard clinical evaluation of our department, all patients presenting to the&#xD;
      Calgary Gut Motility Centre with dysphagia routinely undergo a thorough clinical assessment&#xD;
      including history taking and physical examination. Depending on their presentation, further&#xD;
      evaluation may include upper endoscopy, barium swallow, esophageal manometry, and pH testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients meeting inclusion and exclusion criteria will receive prucalopride for 5 days total,&#xD;
      with 2mg on day 1, then 4mg on days 2 to 5. On day 5 of the intervention, patients will&#xD;
      undergo esophageal manometry. Patients will also complete a symptoms questionnaire for&#xD;
      assessment of dysphagia symptoms and the EQ-5D questionnaire for assessment of global quality&#xD;
      of life at baseline and on day 5 of prucalopride treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Full research ethics approval will be obtained prior to commencement of the study.&#xD;
      Participants will be recruited from patients completing esophageal manometry at the South&#xD;
      Health Campus. Patients who have provided consent to be contacted for research studies and&#xD;
      who have dysphagia and findings of ineffective esophageal motility (IEM) on manometry will be&#xD;
      contacted by the study investigators. The results of their esophageal manometry will be&#xD;
      reviewed with them, and the study will be described to them. If the patient is interested in&#xD;
      study participation, then study investigators will arrange for the patient to come to the&#xD;
      South Health Campus to review the study in detail prior to obtaining informed consent. Thirty&#xD;
      patients will be enrolled in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who meet all inclusion and exclusion criteria will be enrolled. Once enrolled, the&#xD;
      participants will be asked to complete a symptom and quality of life questionnaire. They will&#xD;
      receive the prucalopride pills, to be taken for 5 days with the following instructions: Day&#xD;
      1, take 1 tablet (2 mg), on days 2 through 4, take 2 tablets (4mg) and on day 5, take 2&#xD;
      tablets 1 hour prior to the second scheduled study appointment. On day 5, the patient will be&#xD;
      scheduled at South Health Campus for esophageal manometry. Patients will also be asked to&#xD;
      complete a post-treatment symptom and quality of life questionnaire at that time.&#xD;
