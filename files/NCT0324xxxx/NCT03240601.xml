  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Involuntary muscle activity, often called spasticity, is a common problem following spinal&#xD;
      cord injury (SCI) that can make it hard to move. Many things can cause spasticity including:&#xD;
      muscle stretch, movement, or it can happen for no reason, and it is often described as an&#xD;
      uncontrolled muscle spasm or feeling of stiffness. Drugs are typically used to treat&#xD;
      spasticity, but they often have side effects, like muscle weakness, which can add to movement&#xD;
      problems. Rehabilitation therapies offer alternatives to drugs for treating involuntary&#xD;
      muscle activity, and rehabilitation can also improve daily function and quality of life.&#xD;
      These benefits may be greater when several rehabilitation therapies are used together.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Walking ability can be improved with a type of therapy called &quot;locomotor training&quot;. This type&#xD;
      of therapy may also have the benefit of decreasing spasticity. When locomotor training is&#xD;
      combined with electrical stimulation, the benefits of training may be increased. In this&#xD;
      study, investigators will use a kind of stimulation called transcutaneous spinal cord&#xD;
      stimulation (&quot;tcSCS&quot;) to stimulate participants' spinal cord nerves during locomotor&#xD;
      training.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Involuntary muscle activity, often referred to as spasticity, is a common problem following&#xD;
      spinal cord injury. Spasticity can be evoked by stimuli or occur spontaneously, and it can&#xD;
      manifest as spasms, clonus, or the stiffness associated with hypertonia. While medications&#xD;
      are typically used to treat the general symptoms of spasticity, they often have additional&#xD;
      side effects, like muscle weakness, that can impede rehabilitation. Physical therapeutics&#xD;
      offer an alternative to these drug treatments, but the most effective therapeutic strategy&#xD;
      for managing spasticity has not yet been identified. A combination of physical therapeutics&#xD;
      may provide the best strategy for managing spasticity while also improving general motor&#xD;
      control for functional movements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Walking ability can be improved through locomotor training, which has also been shown to&#xD;
      reduce spasticity. When locomotor training is combined with electrical stimulation, the&#xD;
      benefits of training may be increased. To investigate the potential benefits of this&#xD;
      combinatorial treatment strategy, investigators will use a kind of electrical stimulation&#xD;
      called transcutaneous spinal cord stimulation (&quot;tcSCS&quot;) to stimulate spinal cord nerves&#xD;
      during locomotor training.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to facilitate the translation of study findings into clinical practice, this study&#xD;
      uses a pragmatic design, meaning that the study will involve the use of real world clinical&#xD;
      settings and practices. Participants will undergo their standard physical therapist directed&#xD;
      locomotor training program while receiving transcutaneous spinal cord stimulation (tcSCS) as&#xD;
      an additional treatment. The effects of locomotor training alone will be compared to the&#xD;
      combination of locomotor training with tcSCS, specifically comparing the effects of these&#xD;
      treatments on spasticity and walking function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators expect that the combination of tcSCS with locomotor training will provide 1) a&#xD;
      greater reduction in spasticity and 2) a greater improvement of walking function compared to&#xD;
      locomotor training alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The findings from this study have the potential to rapidly facilitate the translation of a&#xD;
      novel combination treatment for the management of spasticity and improvement of walking&#xD;
      function into real world clinical practice.&#xD;

    <measure>Change in Spasticity - Pendulum/Leg-drop Test</measure>
    <time_frame>Through study completion at 4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>This test measures the amount of spasticity in your leg muscles. You will sit at the edge of a mat with your lower legs hanging over the edge of the mat. Motion capture sensors (Xsens) will be placed on both of your legs to record changes in your knee joint angles when your leg is dropped. The examiner will straighten your leg and then allow it to drop and swing over the edge of the mat. The angle of your knee and the movement of your leg will be recorded as it drops. This will be performed three times for each leg separately.</description>

    <measure>Change in Walking Function - 10m Walk/Walking Speed</measure>
    <time_frame>Through study completion at 4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>You will walk over a mat that contains sensors to measure your walking speed as well as wear motion tracking sensors. You will be allowed to use whatever assistive devices you typically use (e.g., braces, walker, forearm crutches). In addition to walking speed, we will also assess your gait kinematics.</description>

    <measure>Change in Spasticity - Ankle Clonus Test/Foot-drop test</measure>
    <time_frame>Through study completion at 4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>This test measures the amount of spasticity in your ankle. We will use the motion capture sensors to record your ankle joint angles. For this test you will sit upright. Your leg will be raised and released allowing the front of your foot to land on the edge of a box. The angle of your ankle and movement of your foot will be recorded as it drops and catches on the box. This will be performed three times for each leg separately.</description>
