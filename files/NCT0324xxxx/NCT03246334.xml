  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Due to advances in critical care medicine, more patients survive their critical illness.&#xD;
      However, intensive care unit (ICU) survivors often experience long-term physical, cognitive&#xD;
      and mental problems, summarized as post intensive care syndrome (PICS), impacting their&#xD;
      health related quality of life (HRQoL). In what frequency PICS occurs, and to what extent&#xD;
      this influences ICU survivors' HRQoL, is mostly unknown.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aims of this study are therefore to study the: 1) five-year patient outcomes, 2)&#xD;
      predictors for PICS, 3) ratio between HRQoL of ICU-survivors and healthcare related costs,&#xD;
      and 4) care and support needs.&#xD;

      Specific research questions:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. What are the post intensive care symptoms that patients experience during five years&#xD;
           after ICU admissions and what is their HRQoL?&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. What are important predictors for the various physical, cognitive and mental long-term&#xD;
           outcomes?&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. What is the ratio between HRQoL and healthcare related costs?&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. What are the care and support needs of ICU survivors during five years after ICU&#xD;
           admission?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The MONITOR-IC study is a multicenter prospective controlled cohort study in which long-term&#xD;
      outcomes of ICU patients are studied for a period of five year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be carried out in ICUs of four hospitals in the Netherlands; one academic&#xD;
      hospital, one teaching and two non-teaching hospitals. ICU patients will be recruited between&#xD;
      July 2016 and July 2021 with a subsequent follow-up for five years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion:&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the MONITOR-IC study the investigators estimated to include 12.000 patients. This&#xD;
      estimation is based on: 1) the initial ICU admissions in the academic hospital and the three&#xD;
      other participating hospitals together (2,500 and 2,200 respectively per year), and 2) an&#xD;
      estimated response rate of 60%, which is based on previous conducted ICU studies. In the&#xD;
      control cohort, the investigators will include approximately 3000 patients during the next&#xD;
      four years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient recruitment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients scheduled for ICU admission after elective surgery, will be recruited at the&#xD;
      outpatient clinic (anaesthesiology or cardiac surgery) (Figure 1). Patients with a&#xD;
      non-scheduled admission will be recruited at the ICU. Patients will receive information by&#xD;
      ICU nurses and intensivists regarding the aim, content and relevance of the study, and will&#xD;
      be asked for participation. Informed consent is asked for the questionnaires, data from the&#xD;
      patients' individual medical record and data from their health insurance company. In case&#xD;
      patients are unable to give consent, their legal representative will be asked.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mixed methods will be used to collect data, including questionnaires, medical data from&#xD;
      patient records, cost data from health insurance companies and interviews with ICU survivors&#xD;
      and their family members.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients, or their relatives in case patients are not able to fill in the questionnaire&#xD;
      themselves, will be approached to fill in the self-administered paper based or online&#xD;
      questionnaire in total eight times:at ICU admission (T0), at hospital discharge (T1), after 3&#xD;
      months (T2), 12 months (T3), 24 months (T4), 36 months (T5), 48 months (T6) and 60 months&#xD;
      after ICU admission (T7). To get insight into the situation before the ICU admission, the&#xD;
      baseline questionnaire (T0) is provided when the patients is asked for informed consent. This&#xD;
      could be preoperatively for the planned admissions or after admission at the ICU. Then,&#xD;
      patients are asked to rate their situation before the ICU admission.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Items in questionnaire:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients' health status and HRQoL = SF-36 and the EQ-5D-5L.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients' level of frailty and vulnerability = Clinical Frailty Score (CFS)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The level of fatigue = CIS-8, a subscale of the Checklist Individual Strength&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cognitive impairment = abbreviated 14-item Cognitive Failure Questionnaire (CFQ-14).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Anxiety and depression = Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Subjective distress, caused by traumatic events = Impact of Event Scale Revised (IES-R)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Care needs and support from professionals and informal caregiver&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Social consequences = novel question set for changes in family circumstances,&#xD;
           socio-economic stability and care requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Medical data Patients' demographics and information regarding their diagnosis and treatment,&#xD;
      such as primary conditions, pre-existing co-morbidity, disease severity, sepsis,&#xD;
      (re)admission, length of mechanical ventilation, length of ICU stay, delirium (CAM-ICU), pain&#xD;
      (CPOT), expected mortality (based on the APACHE II, SAPS II, MPM II and APACHE III-IV models&#xD;
      and medication, will be extracted from their medical record and the Dutch National Intensive&#xD;
      Care Evaluation (NICE) registry.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Health Insurance data Healthcare use and related costs, covered by the Dutch healthcare&#xD;
      insurance, will be retrieved from Vektis; a Dutch organization which collects and manage&#xD;
      health insurance claimed data of all health insurance companies in the Netherlands.This data&#xD;
      is collected based on the Diagnosis Treatment Combination (DTC); a total set of activities&#xD;
      carried out by the hospital and medical specialists. Additionally, data is collected&#xD;
      regarding nursing days, visits at the outpatient clinic and emergency department, nursing&#xD;
      homes, ambulance transport, consultation with general practitioner, paramedical care&#xD;
      (including physiotherapist, occupational therapist, dietician and speech therapist),&#xD;
      prescribed medication, mental healthcare and revalidation. The Vektis database contains data&#xD;
      from all for healthcare insured citizens and covers 99% of the total Dutch population. Using&#xD;
      patient's unique insurance number the investigators are able to merge patient's insurance&#xD;
      data with the questionnaire data and medical data from the medical record at patient level.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Care delivered by community nurses and informal caregivers is not included in the Vektis&#xD;
      database and will be studied via the questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interviews To get insight into the experiences of ICU survivors during five years after ICU&#xD;
      admission and their need for support, face to face semi-structured interviews will be&#xD;
      conducted with ICU survivors and their family members. Interviews will take place at the&#xD;
      participants' preferred location (home or clinic). Interviews will be conducted until data&#xD;
      saturation is reached.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be purposively sampled based on various experienced outcomes, such as the&#xD;
      quality of life, daily functioning, anxiety, depression, and their experienced needs for more&#xD;
      information or emotional support. Experienced and trained researchers will conduct the&#xD;
      interviews using a topic guide. This guide will be developed using the current literature and&#xD;
      experience of the research team and will cover the following subjects: experiences with the&#xD;
      ICU admission and follow-up, experienced problems and needs for support. All interviews will&#xD;
      be audio recorded and transcribed verbatim.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis Questionnaires, medical record and health insurance data During the data collection,&#xD;
      data are checked on a regular basis to identify out-of-range answers, inconsistent responses,&#xD;
      and missing data. Data from the questionnaires, medical record and healthcare insurance data&#xD;
      will be merged at patient level. Descriptive statistics will be used to describe baseline&#xD;
      characteristics and the incidence of long-term outcomes. Regression analysis will be used to&#xD;
      determine associations between patient characteristics, treatment, and long-term outcomes.&#xD;
      Subgroups will be identified based on their illness and condition (for example sepsis,&#xD;
      delirium, co morbidities, ARDS), treatment (for example length of ICU stay, duration of&#xD;
      mechanical ventilation, dialysis) and social demographics (age, gender, education, family&#xD;
      setting etc).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to predict the various physical, cognitive and mental long-term outcomes, multiple&#xD;
      prediction models will be developed. Multivariable linear (for continuous outcome variables)&#xD;
      and logistic (for dichotomous outcome variables) regression analysis will be performed.&#xD;
      Linear and logistic multilevel models will be used to compare long-term outcomes between the&#xD;
      study population (cohort) and control cohort group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine the ratio between HRQoL and patient outcomes and the health related costs,&#xD;
      quality adjusted life years (QALYs) will be calculated. QALYs are a measure of the state of&#xD;
      health of a person or group in which the benefits, in terms of length of life, are adjusted&#xD;
      to reflect the quality of life. QALYs are calculated by estimating the years of life&#xD;
      remaining for particular treatment and weighting each year with a quality of life score.54&#xD;
      Software Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) will be used for data analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interviews For the analysis of the interview data, the constant comparative method will be&#xD;
      used. Relevant data will be identified and structured by open, axial and selective coding.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two researchers will independently code the transcripts to minimize subjectivity in findings.&#xD;
      The differences and similarities between the codes will be discussed together, and in case of&#xD;
      disagreement, a third researcher will be involved. In the meetings with the team, the&#xD;
      codebook will be refined and emerging categories and themes will be discussed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data analysis will be supported with the use of Atlas.ti, a qualitative data analysis&#xD;
      program.&#xD;
