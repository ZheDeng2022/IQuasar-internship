      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The general objective of the present project is to gain a better understanding of disease&#xD;
      outcome in cACLD patients treated with the new oral DAA. In particular, the project will&#xD;
      focus on:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To evaluate the long term prognosis of patients with compensated advanced chronic liver&#xD;
      disease (cACLD) who achieve sustained virological response (SVR) after the new oral&#xD;
      direct-acting antiviral agents (DAA), and determine clinical and elastographic basal and&#xD;
      follow-up parameters to identify low and high risk groups of developing liver-related&#xD;
      decompensation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prospective cohort study in patients with cACLD in whom basal and annual clinical features&#xD;
      and liver stiffness measurements (LSM) will be performed, and survival free of liver-related&#xD;
      events will be analyzed.&#xD;

      HYPOTHESIS:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - The prognosis of cACLD patients who achieve SVR will improve during follow-up and this will&#xD;
      be reflected in an improvement in liver and spleen stiffness and reduction of liver-related&#xD;
      events. However, on an individual basis, because of many confounding factors, predictability&#xD;
      is unknown.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The general objective of the present project is to gain a better understanding of disease&#xD;
      outcome in cACLD patients treated with the new oral DAA. In particular, the project will&#xD;
      focus on to determine simple clinical and elastographic basal and follow-up parameters to&#xD;
      identify low and high risk groups for developing liver-related decompensation in cACLD&#xD;
      patients who achieve SVR after DAA therapy. As a consequence of this, to provide guidance to&#xD;
      clinicians to decide which cACLD patients should be indefinitely followed and which ones can&#xD;
      be discharged from follow up, and also provide solid information to patients regarding the&#xD;
      possible outcome of their cACLD after SVR.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Study design: Prospective cohort study in an academic center to evaluate long term&#xD;
           prognosis of patients with cACLD who achieve SVR after DAA therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Research subjects: All consecutive patients meeting inclusion criteria who have received&#xD;
           DAA therapy from 1st January 2015 to 31st March 2016.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Variables: Variables will be collected at baseline and annually for a period of 5 years.&#xD;
           Basal data on genotype/subtype, interleukin 28B, viremia, type and duration of therapy.&#xD;
           Data of liver function (INR, albumin, bilirubin), platelet count, aspartate&#xD;
           aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), alkaline phosphatase (AP),&#xD;
           gamma-glutamyltransferase (GGT), US findings (spleen size, collaterals), liver and&#xD;
           spleen stiffness, body mass index (BMI), presence of metabolic syndrome factors&#xD;
           (diabetes, dyslipemia, hypertension), alcohol and tabacco use, treatment with statins&#xD;
           and development of liver-related events. The subgroup of patients with known esophageal&#xD;
           varices prior to therapy will receive a second endoscopy 12-18 months after finishing&#xD;
           therapy. Liver biopsies will be performed (after consent) at the end of follow-up (5&#xD;
           years) in the group of patients who will be candidates for being discharged (LSM&lt;10 kPa)&#xD;
           to ensure cirrhosis regression and learn about the correlation between LSM and histology&#xD;
           after SVR.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Data collection methods and analysis: Patients will be monitored at the outpatient&#xD;
           clinics every 6 months as per usual clinical practice. Every 6 months, clinical data,&#xD;
           laboratory tests and abdominal US will be obtained. Liver and spleen stiffness&#xD;
           (Fibroscan, Echosens) will be performed annually after finishing treatment by an&#xD;
           experienced member (MP), using usual quality criteria. Spleen stiffness measurements&#xD;
           will be performed under US spleen localization and with the same device and conditions&#xD;
           than liver stiffness. All data will be registered in a database.&#xD;
