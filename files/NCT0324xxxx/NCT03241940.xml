    <textblock>
      This phase I trial studies the best dose and side effects of CD19/CD22 chimeric antigen&#xD;
      receptor (CAR) T cells when given together with chemotherapy, and to see how well they work&#xD;
      in treating children or young adults with CD19 positive B acute lymphoblastic leukemia that&#xD;
      has come back or does not respond to treatment. A CAR is a genetically-engineered receptor&#xD;
      made so that immune cells (T cells) can attack cancer cells by recognizing and responding to&#xD;
      the CD19/CD22 proteins. These proteins are commonly found on B acute lymphoblastic leukemia.&#xD;
      Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as fludarabine phosphate and cyclophosphamide, work in&#xD;
      different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping&#xD;
      them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Giving CD19/CD22-CAR T cells and&#xD;
      chemotherapy may work better in treating children or young adults with B acute lymphoblastic&#xD;
      leukemia.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Determine the feasibility of producing CD19/CD22-CAR T cells meeting the established&#xD;
      release criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II.Assess the safety of administering escalating doses of autologous CD19/CD22-CAR T cells&#xD;
      that meet established release specifications in children and young adults with B-cell&#xD;
      hematologic malignancies following a cyclophosphamide/fludarabine conditioning regimen. The&#xD;
      following dose escalation will be used in two disease groups: 1) children and young adults&#xD;
      with relapsed/refractory low disease burden ALL (&lt; 5% blasts), and 2) children and young&#xD;
      adults with relapsed/refractory high disease burden ALL (≥5% blasts) or lymphoma:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Dose Level -1: 3 x 105 transduced T cells/kg (± 20%)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Dose Level 1: 1 x 106 transduced T cells/kg (± 20%)&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Dose Level 2: 3 x 106 transduced T cells/kg (± 20%)&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Dose Level 3: 1 x 107 transduced T cells/kg (± 20%)&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Evaluate the ability of CD19/CD22-CAR T cells to mediate clinical activity in children and&#xD;
      young adults with B-acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL).&#xD;
&#xD;
      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Analyze alterations in early B cell development induced by immune pressure exerted via&#xD;
      CD19/CD22-CAR T cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Evaluate whether subjects receiving CD19/CD22-CAR T cells relapse with loss or diminished&#xD;
      expression of CD19 and/or CD22, when feasible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. Measure persistence of CD19/CD22-CAR T cells in the blood, bone marrow and cerebral&#xD;
      spinal fluid (CSF), and explore correlations between CD19/CD22-CAR T cell properties and CAR&#xD;
      T cell efficacy and persistence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. Establish the utility of chromatin structure and epigenomic technology to characterize&#xD;
      CAR T cell therapies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. Explore the ability of CD19/CD22-CAR T cells to mediate clinical activity in children and&#xD;
      young adults with refractory B cell lymphoma in a non-statistical cohort due to expectations&#xD;
      of low accrual.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of CD19/CD22-CAR T cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive fludarabine phosphate intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on days -4 to -2&#xD;
      and cyclophosphamide IV over 60 minutes on day -2. Patients then receive CD19/CD22-CAR T&#xD;
      cells IV over 10-20 minutes on day 0. Patients that benefited from the first dose of&#xD;
      CD19/CD22-CAR T cells, had no unacceptable side effects, and have enough cells left over may&#xD;
      receive 2 or 3 additional doses of CD19/CD22-CAR T cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up daily until day 14, twice&#xD;
      weekly until day 28, at 2 and 3 months, every 3 months until month 12, every 6-12 months up&#xD;
      to year 5, and then annually for years 6-15.&#xD;

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        1.1 INCLUSION CRITERIA&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Diagnosis: ALL In view of the PI and the primary oncologist, there must be no&#xD;
             available alternative curative therapies or subject has declined to pursue alternative&#xD;
             therapy; and subjects must be either ineligible for allogeneic stem cell transplant&#xD;
             (SCT), have refused SCT, recurred after SCT, or have disease activity that prohibits&#xD;
             SCT at the time of enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Chemotherapy refractory disease in subjects with B-ALL is defined as progression&#xD;
                  or stable disease after two lines of therapies&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Recurrence of disease after achieving a complete response (CR).&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. Subjects with persistent or relapsed minimal residual disease (MRD) (by flow&#xD;
                  cytometry, PCR, FISH, or next generation sequencing) require verification of MRD&#xD;
                  positivity on two occasions at least 4 weeks apart.&#xD;
&#xD;
               4. Subjects with Philadelphia Chromosome positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia&#xD;
                  (Ph+ALL) subjects are eligible if they progressed, had stable disease or relapsed&#xD;
                  after two lines of therapy, including tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs).&#xD;
&#xD;
               5. Subjects with recurrence of isolated CNS relapse after achieving complete&#xD;
                  remission (CR); if relapsed with MRD, will require verification of MRD positivity&#xD;
                  on two occasions at least 4 weeks apart.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Diagnosis: Lymphoma Subjects with lymphoma must have progressed, had SD, or recurred&#xD;
             after initial treatment regimens that include an anthracycline and an anti CD20&#xD;
             monoclonal antibody. Subjects who relapse ≥12 months after therapy should have&#xD;
             progressed after autologous transplant or been ineligible for autologous transplant.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. CD19 expression CD19 expression is required at any time since diagnosis. If patient&#xD;
             has received anti-CD19 targeted therapy (i.e. Blinatumomab), then CD19 expression must&#xD;
             be subsequently demonstrated. CD19 expression. must be detected on greater than 50% of&#xD;
             the malignant cells by immunohistochemistry or ≥ 90% by flow cytometry. The choice of&#xD;
             whether to use flow cytometry or immunohistochemistry will be determined by what is&#xD;
             the most easily available tissue sample in each subject. In general,&#xD;
             immunohistochemistry will be used for lymph node biopsies, flow cytometry will be used&#xD;
             for peripheral blood and bone marrow samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Subjects who have undergone autologous SCT with disease progression or relapse&#xD;
             following SCT will be eligible if all other eligibility criteria are met. Subjects who&#xD;
             have undergone allogeneic SCT will be eligible if, in addition to meeting other&#xD;
             eligibility criteria, they are at least 100 days post-transplant, they have no&#xD;
             evidence of active GVHD and have been without immunosuppressive agents for at least 30&#xD;
             days.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Subjects who have undergone prior anti-CD19 or anti-CD22 CAR therapy will be eligible&#xD;
             if &lt; 5% of circulating levels of CD3+ cells express the previous CAR by flow&#xD;
             cytometry.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Must have evaluable or measurable disease; subjects with lymphoma must have evaluable&#xD;
             or measurable disease according to the revised IWG Response Criteria for Malignant&#xD;
             Lymphoma[66] must be present. Lesions that have been previously irradiated will be&#xD;
             considered measurable only if progression has been documented following completion of&#xD;
             radiation therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. At least 2 weeks or 5 half-lives, whichever is shorter, must have elapsed since any&#xD;
             prior systemic therapy at the time the subject is planned for leukapheresis, except&#xD;
             for systemic inhibitory/stimulatory immune checkpoint therapy, which requires 5&#xD;
             half-lives.&#xD;
&#xD;
             Exceptions:&#xD;
&#xD;
             f. There is no time restriction with regard to prior intrathecal chemotherapy (incl.&#xD;
             steroids) provided there is complete recovery from any acute toxic effects of such; g.&#xD;
             Subjects receiving hydroxyurea may be enrolled provided there has been no increase in&#xD;
             dose for at least 2 weeks prior to starting apheresis; h. Subjects who are on standard&#xD;
             ALL maintenance type chemotherapy (vincristine, 6-mercaptopurine or oral methotrexate)&#xD;
             may be enrolled provided that chemotherapy is discontinued at least 1 week prior to&#xD;
             apheresis.&#xD;
&#xD;
             i. Subjects receiving steroid therapy at physiologic replacement doses (≤ 5 mg/day of&#xD;
             prednisone or equivalent doses of other corticosteroids) only are allowed provided&#xD;
             there has been no increase in dose for at least 2 weeks prior to starting apheresis;&#xD;
             j. For radiation therapy: Radiation therapy must have been completed at least 3 weeks&#xD;
             prior to enrollment, with the exception that there is no time restriction if the&#xD;
             volume of bone marrow treated is less than 10% and also the subject has&#xD;
             measurable/evaluable disease outside the radiation port.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Toxicities due to prior therapy must be stable and recovered to ≤ Grade 1 (except for&#xD;
             clinically non-significant toxicities, such as alopecia, nutritional support measures,&#xD;
             electrolyte abnormalities, or those not impacting the investigator's ability to assess&#xD;
             treatment emergent toxicities)&#xD;

             * if these cytopenias are not judged by the investigator to be due to underlying&#xD;
             disease (i.e. potentially reversible with anti-neoplastic therapy); A subject will not&#xD;
             be excluded because of pancytopenia ≥ Grade 3 if it is due to disease, based on the&#xD;
             results of bone marrow studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. CNS Status&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Subjects with ALL&#xD;
&#xD;
                  Subjects with the following CNS status are eligible only in the absence of&#xD;
                  neurologic symptoms suggestive of CNS leukemia, such as cranial nerve palsy:&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  CNS 1, defined as absence of blasts in cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) on&#xD;
                       cytospin preparation, regardless of the number of WBCs;&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  CNS 2, defined as presence of &lt; 5/µL WBCs in CSF and cytospin positive for&#xD;
                       blasts, or &gt; 5/µL WBCs but negative by Steinherz/Bleyer algorithm:&#xD;
&#xD;
                         -  CNS 2a: &lt;10/µL RBCs; &lt; 5/µL WBCs and cytospin positive for blasts;&#xD;
&#xD;
                         -  CNS 2b: ≥10/µL RBCs; &lt; 5/µL WBCs and cytospin positive for blasts;&#xD;
&#xD;
                         -  CNS 2c: ≥10/µL RBCs; ≥5/µL WBCs and cytospin positive for blasts but&#xD;
                            negative by Steinherz/Bleyer algorithm.&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Subjects with lymphoma&#xD;
&#xD;
             Subjects must have no signs or symptoms of CNS disease or detectable evidence of CNS&#xD;
             disease on MRI at the time of screening. Subjects who have previously been treated for&#xD;
             CNS disease and who have the following CNS status will be eligible:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  CNS 1, defined as absence of blasts in cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) on cytospin&#xD;
                  preparation, regardless of the number of WBCs;&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  CNS 2, defined as presence of &lt; 5/µL WBCs in CSF and cytospin positive for&#xD;
                  blasts, or &gt; 5/µL WBCs but negative by Steinherz/Bleyer algorithm:&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  CNS 2a: &lt; 10/µL RBCs; &lt; 5/µL WBCs and cytospin positive for blasts;&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  CNS 2b: ≥ 10/µL RBCs; &lt; 5/µL WBCs and cytospin positive for blasts;&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  CNS 2c: ≥ 10/µL RBCs; ≥ 5/µL WBCs and cytospin positive for blasts but&#xD;
                       negative by Steinherz/Bleyer algorithm.&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. Females of childbearing potential must have a negative serum or urine pregnancy test&#xD;
             (females who have undergone surgical sterilization or who have been postmenopausal for&#xD;
             at least 2 years are not considered to be of childbearing potential)&#xD;
&#xD;
         14. Contraception Subjects of child-bearing or child-fathering potential must be willing&#xD;
             to practice birth control from the time of enrollment on this study and for four (4)&#xD;
             months after receiving the preparative regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
             Females of child-bearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test because of the&#xD;
             potentially dangerous/unknown effects on the fetus.&#xD;
&#xD;
         15. Ability to give informed consent. All subjects ≥ 18 years of age must be able to give&#xD;
             informed consent. For subjects &lt;18 years old their legal authorized representative&#xD;
             (LAR) (i.e. parent or guardian) must give informed consent. Pediatric subjects will be&#xD;
             included in age appropriate discussion and verbal assent will be obtained for those &gt;&#xD;
             7 years of age, when appropriate.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1.2 EXCLUSION CRITERIA&#xD;
&#xD;
        Subjects meeting any of the following criteria are not eligible for participation in the&#xD;
        study:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Recurrent or refractory ALL limited to isolated testicular.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Subjects with radiologically-detected CNS lymphoma or CNS 3 disease (presence of ≥&#xD;
             5/µL WBCs in CSF and cytospin positive for blasts [in the absence of a traumatic&#xD;
             lumbar puncture] and/or clinical signs of CNS leukemia).&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Hyperleukocytosis (≥ 50,000 blasts/µL) or rapidly progressive disease that in the&#xD;
             estimation of the investigator and sponsor would compromise ability to complete study&#xD;
             therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. History of malignancy other than non-melanoma skin cancer or carcinoma in situ (e.g.&#xD;
             cervix, bladder, breast) unless disease free for at least 3 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Presence of fungal, bacterial, viral, or other infection that is uncontrolled or&#xD;
             requiring IV antimicrobials for management. Simple UTI and uncomplicated bacterial&#xD;
             pharyngitis are permitted if responding to active treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
             Ongoing infection with HIV or hepatitis B (HBsAg positive) or hepatitis C virus&#xD;
             (anti-HCV positive) as the immunosuppression contained in this study will pose&#xD;
             unacceptable risk. A history of hepatitis B or hepatitis C is permitted if the viral&#xD;
             load is undetectable per quantitative PCR and/or nucleic acid testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. CNS disorder such as cerebrovascular ischemia/hemorrhage, dementia, cerebellar&#xD;
             disease, or autoimmune disease with CNS involvement that in the judgment of the&#xD;
             investigator may impair the ability to evaluate neurotoxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. History of myocardial infarction, cardiac angioplasty or stenting, unstable angina, or&#xD;
             other clinically significant cardiac disease within 12 months of enrollment, or have&#xD;
             cardiac atrial or cardiac ventricular lymphoma involvement.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Subjects receiving anticoagulation therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Any medical condition that in the judgement of the principal investigator is likely to&#xD;
             interfere with assessment of safety or efficacy of study treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. History of severe immediate hypersensitivity reaction to any of the agents used in&#xD;
             this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Women of child-bearing potential who are pregnant or breastfeeding because of the&#xD;
             potentially dangerous effects of the conditioning lymphodepletion chemotherapy on the&#xD;
             fetus or infant. Females who have undergone surgical sterilization or who have been&#xD;
             postmenopausal for at least 2 years are not considered to be of childbearing&#xD;
             potential.&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. In the investigator's judgment, the subject is unlikely to complete all&#xD;
             protocol-required study visits or procedures, including follow-up visits, or comply&#xD;
             with the study requirements for participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. May not have primary immunodeficiency or history of systemic autoimmune disease (e.g.&#xD;
             Crohns, rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus) resulting in end organ injury or&#xD;
             requiring systemic immunosuppression/systemic disease modifying agents within the last&#xD;
             2 years.&#xD;
