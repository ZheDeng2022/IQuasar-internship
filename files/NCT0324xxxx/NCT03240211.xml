  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an international, multicenter, multi-arm, phase Ib, model-based dose-escalation&#xD;
      study. The primary objectives of the study in each arm is to determine the maximum tolerated&#xD;
      dose (MTD), recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D), dose limiting toxicities (DLTs) and to evaluate&#xD;
      the clinical efficacy at the MTD of various combinations of pembrolizumab, pralatrexate and&#xD;
      decitabine.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The peripheral T-cell lymphomas (PTCLs) are rare subtypes of Non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) with&#xD;
      unique clinicopathologic features and very unfavorable prognosis. Recently it has been&#xD;
      demonstrated that PTCLs are characterized by recurrent mutations in epigenetic operators&#xD;
      (e.g. TET2, DNMT3A, and IDH2) and escape from immune surveillance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The safety and toxicity of these combinations will be evaluated throughout the entire study.&#xD;
      Dose allocation in Arms A and C will be based upon a continual reassessment method (CRM), and&#xD;
      combination allocation in Arm B will be conducted using a DLT-adapted partial order continual&#xD;
      reassessment method (POCRM) for dose-finding with combinations of agents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Hypothesis: If pralatrexate and/or decitabine functions in an immunomodulatory fashion&#xD;
      then priming and modulating the malignant cells and the microenvironment will enhance the&#xD;
      antitumor activity of pembrolizumab in patients with PTCLs and CTCLs.&#xD;

             that might confound the results of the trial, interfere with the subject's&#xD;
             participation for the full duration of the trial, or is not in the best interest of&#xD;
             the subject to participate, in the opinion of the treating investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has known psychiatric or substance abuse disorders that would interfere with&#xD;
             cooperation with the requirements of the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Is pregnant or breastfeeding or expecting to conceive or father children within the&#xD;
             projected duration of the trial, starting with the pre-screening or screening visit&#xD;
             through 120 days after the last dose of trial treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has received prior therapy with an anti-PD-1, anti-PD-L1, or anti-PD-L2 agent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has a known history of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) (HIV 1/2 antibodies).&#xD;

             [qualitative] is detected).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has received a live vaccine or live-attenuated vaccine within 30 days of planned start&#xD;
             of study therapy. Administration of killed vaccines is allowed. Note: Seasonal&#xD;
             influenza vaccines for injection are generally inactivated flu vaccines and are&#xD;
             allowed; however intranasal influenza vaccines (e.g., Flu-Mist®) are live attenuated&#xD;
             vaccines, and are not allowed.&#xD;
