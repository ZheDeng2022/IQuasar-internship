      This evaluation will be a one-year feasibility study to characterize the neuroprotective&#xD;
      benefits of Gilenya and its effects on cognition and grey matter volumes. The study will&#xD;
      enroll 15 patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis being treated with Gilenya and&#xD;
      5 healthy controls. Each participant will undergo a battery of neurometric testing at&#xD;
      baseline, six months, and one year. In addition, patients will undergo high-field 7T MRI at&#xD;
      the same time points.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cognitive impairment is a well-recognized manifestation of multiple sclerosis (MS) with&#xD;
      prevalence estimates ranging from 43 to 70%. It is also known to occur as early as the first&#xD;
      demyelinating event and is a major factor contributing to quality of life in MS. Treatment&#xD;
      strategies for cognitive impairment in MS are limited. Several agents have been tested as&#xD;
      therapeutics for MS-related cognitive dysfunction and have showed no major benefit. Cognitive&#xD;
      rehabilitation has shown some promise, but the data are limited and many studies have&#xD;
      suffered from methodological shortcomings. Given the lack of well-established treatment&#xD;
      options and the substantial impact of cognitive impairment, protection of cognitive function&#xD;
      from the earliest stages of the disease is of great importance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cognitive outcomes received relatively little attention in the pivotal studies of MS disease&#xD;
      modifying therapies (DMT), but some data suggest that DMT may have a positive impact on&#xD;
      cognition. Gilenya is of special interest because it was found to have a significant&#xD;
      protective effect on whole brain atrophy when compared against placebo and intramuscular&#xD;
      interferon Î²-1a in two phase III studies, showing a 31-35% reduction in percentage brain&#xD;
      volume change. Gilenya's effect on whole brain atrophy leads to the natural hypothesis that&#xD;
      it may have a beneficial effect on cognitive function in MS. Also of particular interest is&#xD;
      the extent to which protection of the thalamus and cortex contributes to Gilenya's effect on&#xD;
      whole brain atrophy and possible effects on cognition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will enroll 15 subjects from the Cleveland Clinic Mellen Center patient population.&#xD;
      Participants must have been on Gilenya for at least 6 months at the time of study entry. The&#xD;
      study will involve three assessments: at baseline, six months, and one year. At each time&#xD;
      point, participants will undergo 7T MRI of the brain with and without contrast. Participants&#xD;
      will also undergo a battery of neurometric testing at each time point. The tests will include&#xD;
      the Brief Visuospatial Memory Test - Revised (visuospatial skills), the iPadTM Processing&#xD;
      Speed Test (processing speed), the Selective Reminding Test (verbal learning and memory), and&#xD;
      the Delis-Kaplan Executive Function System Sorting Test (problem-solving skills; can only be&#xD;
      administered at baseline and one year due to version limitations).&#xD;
