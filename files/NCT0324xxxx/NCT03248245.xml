    <textblock>
      This study includes designing, implementing and evaluating the effectiveness of process-based&#xD;
      measures for improving interprofessional collaboration in Norwegian primary schools (5-7th&#xD;
      grades). Focusing on leadership and organizational development, the overarching aim is to&#xD;
      improve the use of existing interprofessional competence within schools. The interventions&#xD;
      include meetings at municipal-level (strategic), school-level (operative) and class-level&#xD;
      (operative), with feedback procedures to ensure communication between and within all levels.&#xD;
      Also school internal and school external collaborators are involved at all levels of&#xD;
      intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to avoid contradictory roles, an implementation team is responsible for developing&#xD;
      and implementing the intervention, while the research team conduct an independent evaluation.&#xD;
      The model will be evaluated by a cluster-randomized design to evaluate the effectiveness of&#xD;
      the intervention. The hypothesis is that schools that utilize the process-based intervention&#xD;
      (intervention group) will improve their interprofessional team work in a way that enhances&#xD;
      the pupil's learning- environment and teachers professional competence, self-efficacy and&#xD;
      efficient use of working hours compared to their counterparts in the control group. We&#xD;
      anticipate main effects to be found at pupil level, mainly through improved early assessment,&#xD;
      intervention and efficient follow-up. The project is a collaboration between four Norwegian&#xD;
      municipalities and includes a total of 37 Schools, half of which will be randomized to&#xD;
      experimental condition and half to control condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The project is financed by The Norwegian Directorate for Education and Training with a&#xD;
      duration of three years and three months. The project is led by Professor Ira&#xD;
      Malmberg-Heimonen. The project is a collaboration between Faculty of Social Sciences and the&#xD;
      Work Research Institute (AFI), at Oslo and Akerhus University College of Applied Sciences.&#xD;
      Participants in the project are Ira Malmberg-Heimonen (project leader), Anne Grete Tøge,&#xD;
      Therese Saltkjel, Knut Fossestøl, Elin Borg and Selma Therese Lyng. Participants in the&#xD;
      implementation team are Øyvind Pålshaugen, Hanne Christoffersen and Christian Wittrock, also&#xD;
      from Oslo and Akerhus University College of Applied Sciences, in addition to Torbjørn Lund&#xD;

      Comprehensive process-based intervention for improving interprofessional team collaboration&#xD;

&#xD;
      There are interprofessional resources in Norwegian schools and municipalities that are not&#xD;
      fully utilized/exploited. Oslo and Akershus University College of Applied Sciences has been&#xD;
      commissioned to design, implement and evaluate the effectiveness of a process-based model for&#xD;
      interprofessional team collaboration in Norwegian primary schools. In order for municipal&#xD;
      school owners and leaders to better utilize the potential related to existing&#xD;
      interprofessional resources in schools, municipalities will implement a process-based model&#xD;
      with a focus on leadership and better coordination of existing interprofessional resources.&#xD;
      While the work process will be the same for all schools enrolled to experimental group, the&#xD;
      content of the intervention will vary based on local conditions, resources and needs. A&#xD;
      manual describes how the work process should be carried out. The model is hereafter referred&#xD;
      to as the LOG-model, a Norwegian acronym, referring to the terms leadership, organization and&#xD;
      coordination&#xD;
&#xD;
      The evaluation will be conducted as a cluster-randomized trial, where 37 primary schools will&#xD;
      be randomly assigned to experimental and control groups. Schools randomized to experimental&#xD;
      group will implement the LOG-model, while schools assign to the control group will work as&#xD;
      previously with interprofessional collaboration. While schools in the experimental group will&#xD;
      receive economic resources to compensate for implementing the model and participating in the&#xD;
      research, schools randomized to control group will get, however, somewhat less financial&#xD;
      compensation for taking part in the research. The implementation team offer supervision and&#xD;
      support to schools randomized to the experimental group throughout the project period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main working method in the LOG-model is the interchange and feedback process between&#xD;
      discursive practices, i.e. the discussion of interprofessional team collaborating measures&#xD;
      and the execution/testing of these measures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Staff from Oslo and Akershus College of Applied Sciences will have different roles in the&#xD;
      project. Beside the implementation team with the role of facilitating implementation&#xD;
      processes in schools randomized to experimental group, the process evaluation team will study&#xD;
      implementation processes mainly based on qualitative data. The researchers in the&#xD;
      effect-evaluation team will mainly work with quantitative data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior to randomization a baseline questionnaire will be collected from the teachers and their&#xD;
      interprofessional collaborators e.g. educational and psychological counseling services,&#xD;
      public health nurses and child welfare social workers. Baseline information on pupils will be&#xD;
      based on a survey data collected autumn 2017 and survey data and administrative data for&#xD;
      follow-up + 12 and + 24 months. Long-term effects for pupils will be measured after the&#xD;
      project has formally ended, up to 4 years after baseline, given that the Norwegian&#xD;
      Directorate for Education and Training authorize access and deliver administrative data for&#xD;
      follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The project will assess whether schools randomized to experimental group that are&#xD;
      implementing the LOG-model improve their interprofessional collaboration in a way that has&#xD;
      positive effects on learning environment, learning outcomes and early intervention for&#xD;
      pupils. At teacher level we expect the model to increase competence for interprofessional&#xD;
      collaboration, teacher self-efficacy and more efficient use of teachers working time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This knowledge will inform the debate on what the effects of interprofessional team&#xD;
      collaboration can be in schools.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The project is funded by The Norwegian Directorate for Education and Training and led by&#xD;
      professor Ira Malmberg-Heimonen, Oslo and Akershus University College.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants in the project are Ira Malmberg-Heimonen (project leader), Knut Fossestøl,&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>Cluster-randomized study. After baseline, schools will be randomized to experimental and control groups schools. The LOG-model is implemented in experimental schools, while control group schools continues with their ordinary practices (&quot;treatment as usual&quot;). Effects on teachers are analyzed on the follow up areas: interprofessional team collaboration, teachers working hours, teacher's self-efficacy. Effects on pupils are analyzed on the follow up areas: learning environment- and outcome, early intervention. Effects on school level are analyzed on the follow up areas: special needs education, pupils learning outcome.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>Besides the LOG-manual, school owners and leaders receive economic compensation and the intervention team will supervise the implementation. School-owners, school leaders and teachers will participate in dialogue-seminars at the municipal level and the school level respectively. The aim is to discuss and agree on the goal and content of the work and discuss the experiences from the implementation. The main arena for discussing and practical implementation will be in local collaborating teams or &quot;resource teams&quot; in each school. The resource teams at schools will consist of various interprofessional competences in addition to the school leader. The main method in the LOG-model is the interchange and feedback process between the discussion of measures and the execution of these measures.</description>
