  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Monoclonal antibodies against PCSK9 are innovative agents that provide very potent LDL&#xD;
      reduction when administered on top of statins. PCSK9 antibodies prevent LDL receptor&#xD;
      degradation and enhance circulatory LDL cholesterol clearance. High LDL is a major risk&#xD;
      factor for PAD and therefore lipid-lowering therapy constitutes another important therapeutic&#xD;
      intervention for patients with PAD. Evolocumab is a common PCSK-9 inhibitor that has been&#xD;
      shown to reduce plasma LDL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study sixty subjects will be treated with high dose statins for 8 weeks followed by 8&#xD;
      weeks of high dose statin + evolocumab (420mg/4 wk) therapy. The laboratory assessments will&#xD;
      be performed at the screening (baseline), after 8 weeks of high-dose statin therapy, and 24&#xD;
      hr and 8 weeks after high dose statin + evolocumab therapy&#xD;
