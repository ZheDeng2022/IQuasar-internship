  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research is being done to test the safety of the combination of the study drugs&#xD;
      fostamatinib and paclitaxel. This study tests different doses of the drugs to see which doses&#xD;
      are safest in people with ovaria cancer when given together.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase I, open-label, non-randomized multicenter dose-escalation study with the&#xD;
      primary objective to determine the maximally tolerated dose (MTD) of fostamatinib when&#xD;
      administered with weekly paclitaxel in women with recurrent platinum-resistant ovarian,&#xD;
      fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Between 8 and 18 adult female subjects will be enrolled and receive weekly paclitaxel in&#xD;
      combination with increasing doses of fostamatinib. There will be three dosing intervals of&#xD;
      fostamatinib (100 mg bid, 150 mg bid, and 200mg bid) selected based on prior phase I studies&#xD;
      of single agent fostamatinib. Dose-escalation will follow a modified toxicity probability&#xD;
      interval (mTPI) design. In this study, up to 18 adult female subjects will be enrolled and&#xD;
      receive weekly paclitaxel in combination with fostamatinib at the MTD of the combination; at&#xD;
      least 6 patients with receive fostamatinib plus paclitaxel at the MTD.&#xD;

    <description>Participants will receive paclitaxel on Days 1, 8 and 15 of each cycle and fostamatinib at a fixed oral dose twice daily throughout each 28-day cycle. The dose of fostamatinib will be determined by the enrollment dose level. Given the mTPI design, dose-escalation decisions will be made based on the three dosing intervals, where the underdosing interval corresponds to dose escalation (E), overdosing interval corresponds to dose de-escalation (D), and proper dosing corresponds to staying at the current dose (S). The initial dose level will be Level 1 of Table 1. Participants will be individually continually assessed for DLT. The associated dose-escalation decisions are presented in Table 2. For illustration, suppose a cohort of 3 patients is at the current dose.</description>

      <textblock>
        -  Inclusion Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Patients must have histologically or cytologically confirmed epithelial ovarian,&#xD;
                  fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal carcinoma. Histologic documentation (via&#xD;
                  the pathology report) of the original primary tumor is required.&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Patients must have measurable disease, according to RECIST v1.1.&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. Patients must have recurrent, platinum-resistant disease (defined as having&#xD;
                  relapsed within 6 months of last platinum-containing regimen) or be unable to&#xD;
                  receive further platinum therapy. There is no limit on the number of prior&#xD;
                  treatment regimens; however, patients may not have previously received weekly&#xD;
                  paclitaxel in the recurrent setting. Previous dose dense paclitaxel as initial&#xD;
                  therapy is allowable.&#xD;
&#xD;
               4. Patients must have the ability to take oral medications.&#xD;
&#xD;
               5. Females, age ≥18 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
               6. ECOG performance status ≤2 (Karnofsky ≥60%, see Appendix A).&#xD;
&#xD;
               7. Life expectancy of greater than 3 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
               8. Patients must have normal organ and marrow function.&#xD;
&#xD;
               9. The effects of fostamatinib on the developing human fetus are unknown. For this&#xD;
                  reason, women of childbearing potential must agree to use adequate contraception&#xD;
                  (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry&#xD;
                  and for the duration of study participation. Should a woman become pregnant or&#xD;
                  suspect she is pregnant while she is participating in this study, she should&#xD;
                  inform her treating physician immediately.&#xD;
&#xD;
              10. Patients who are willing and able to comply with the protocol and study&#xD;
                  procedures including willingness to undergo tumor biopsy or paracentesis for&#xD;
                  tumor cells before therapy (at baseline) and after initiation of treatment&#xD;
                  (before Cycle 2) for all subjects if this is clinically and safely feasible to do&#xD;
                  so.&#xD;
&#xD;
              11. Patients with known history or current symptoms of cardiac disease, or history of&#xD;
                  treatment with cardiotoxic agents, should have a clinical risk assessment of&#xD;
                  cardiac function using the New York Heart Association Functional Classification.&#xD;
                  To be eligible for this trial, patients should be class 2B or better.&#xD;
&#xD;
              12. Patients with a prior or concurrent malignancy whose natural history or treatment&#xD;
                  does not have the potential to interfere with the safety or efficacy assessment&#xD;
                  of the investigational regimen are eligible for this trial, with permission of&#xD;
                  the protocol chair.&#xD;
&#xD;
              13. Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients on effective anti-retroviral&#xD;
                  therapy with undetectable viral load within 6 months are eligible for this trial&#xD;
                  if the anti-retroviral therapy is not an excluded concurrent medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
              14. For patients with evidence of chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection, the HBV&#xD;
                  viral load must be undetectable on suppressive therapy, if indicated and the&#xD;
                  suppressive therapy is not an excluded concurrent medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
              15. Patients with a history of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection must have been&#xD;
                  treated and cured. For patients with HCV infection who are currently on&#xD;
                  treatment, they are eligible if they have an undetectable HCV viral load and the&#xD;
                  HCV therapy is not an excluded concurrent medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
              16. Patients with treated brain metastases are eligible if follow-up brain imaging&#xD;
                  after central nervous system (CNS)-directed therapy shows no evidence of&#xD;
                  progression.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Exclusion Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Patients who have had chemotherapy or radiotherapy within 4 weeks (6 weeks for&#xD;
                  nitrosoureas or mitomycin C) prior to entering the study or those who have not&#xD;
                  recovered from adverse events due to agents administered more than 3 weeks&#xD;
                  earlier. Hormonal therapy directed at the malignant tumor must be discontinued at&#xD;
                  least one week prior to registration.&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Patients who are currently receiving or have previously received any other&#xD;
                  investigational agents within 3 weeks prior to entering the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. Patients with known untreated brain metastases, as progressive neurologic&#xD;
                  dysfunction may develop that would confound the evaluation of neurologic and&#xD;
                  other adverse events.&#xD;
&#xD;
               4. Patients with Grade 2 or greater neuropathy.&#xD;
&#xD;
               5. History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or&#xD;
                  biologic composition to fostamatinib or paclitaxel. Patients who are able to&#xD;
                  tolerate paclitaxel on a desensitization protocol will be allowed.&#xD;
&#xD;
               6. Strong CYP3A4 inhibitors or inducers should not be used within 3 days of Day 1&#xD;
                  dosing until the end of study. Moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors or inducers should be&#xD;
                  used with caution.&#xD;
&#xD;
               7. Uncontrolled intercurrent illness&#xD;
&#xD;
               8. Pregnant women are excluded from this study because the potential for teratogenic&#xD;
                  or abortifacient effects of fostamatinib are unknown. Because there is an unknown&#xD;
                  but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment&#xD;
                  of the mother with fostamatinib, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the&#xD;
                  mother is treated with fostamatinib. These potential risks may also apply to&#xD;
                  other agents used in this study.&#xD;
