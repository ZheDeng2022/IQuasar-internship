  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A new, practical program, entitled Getting Ahead in a Just-Gettin'-By World, provides a novel&#xD;
      approach to addressing this previously intractable problem. During the progression through&#xD;
      the Getting Ahead program, individuals develop an understanding of the hidden rules of&#xD;
      economic class and have an opportunity to craft a hopeful future story based on the practical&#xD;
      concepts investigated in the modules. Getting Ahead has shown great success in various&#xD;
      organizations and communities in multiple sectors, including healthcare, but has not been&#xD;
      studied in the context of advancing cancer prevention and control.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study team hypothesizes that the Getting Ahead program, applied in safety net practices&#xD;
      with primary care patients living in poverty, will improve cancer prevention and early&#xD;
      detection activities, mediated by a shift in future orientation gained through the program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This pilot study aims to adapt, apply, and evaluate the established Getting Ahead program in&#xD;
      a health care setting and assess its effect on cancer prevention and early detection&#xD;
      activities for vulnerable populations. By generating process and outcome data on a novel&#xD;
      intervention to help people advance out of poverty, this research will set the stage for&#xD;
      larger intervention studies, and also will advance understanding of the mechanisms by which&#xD;
      growing a future orientation can improve cancer preventive service delivery among vulnerable&#xD;
      populations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specifically, this study aims to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Implement Getting Ahead among cohorts of patients at a network of safety net practices.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Assess the paradigm shift in developing a future orientation associated with&#xD;
           participation in the Getting Ahead program.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Evaluate the effect of the Getting Ahead program and its associated paradigm shift on&#xD;
           graduates' cancer prevention and early detection activities.&#xD;

    <description>The Getting Ahead program is a unique welldeveloped program that allows carefully guided introspection toward the crafting of tailored solutions aimed at addressing complex social determinants of health among individuals living in vulnerable populations where the achievement of health equity often seems unattainable. The important lens of health equity is a key component of this proposal and is consistent with the American Cancer Society overarching emphasis on reduction of health disparities and achievement of health equity.</description>
