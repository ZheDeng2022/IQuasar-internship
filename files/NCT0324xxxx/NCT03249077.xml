    <textblock>
      In preparation for the roll out of the Medicare Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) in 2018,&#xD;
      Kaiser Permanente Northwest (KPNW), a large, integrated health care system, plans to pilot&#xD;
      the implementation of DPP starting in April 2017. Patients 19-75 years old at high risk for&#xD;
      diabetes will be offered DPP online or DPP in-person. A pragmatic, rigorous, quantitative and&#xD;
      qualitative evaluation will be conducted to compare patients enrolled in DPP (either online&#xD;
      or in-person) to those not enrolled to better inform future implementation efforts of DPP&#xD;
      within and outside of KPNW. This study is a natural experiment project.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The prevalence of prediabetes and obesity among U.S. adults age 40 and older is significant,&#xD;
      with over 30% having prediabetes and over 40% having obesity.[1,2] Prediabetes and obesity&#xD;
      increase the risk for diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and poor quality of life, and are&#xD;
      responsible for substantial healthcare costs.[3] In response to the multi-level burden of&#xD;
      prediabetes and obesity, there have been several efforts to prevent diabetes at the&#xD;
      population level and reduce healthcare costs,[4,5] including national implementation and&#xD;
      reimbursement of the successful Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Beginning in April 2018, the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) made a landmark&#xD;
      decision to reimburse clinical and non-clinical settings for providing DPP to Medicare&#xD;
      beneficiaries (i.e., Medicare DPP); this coverage is currently for in-person DPP only and not&#xD;
      digital DPP.[6,7] CMS's decision to cover DPP among older adults with prediabetes further&#xD;
      catapulted efforts within healthcare organizations to address the increasing number of&#xD;
      individuals with diabetes receiving care in their facilities. However, few studies have&#xD;
      examined the sustainability of providing DPP based on maintenance of the effect (i.e.,&#xD;
      long-term change in weight and HbA1c), healthcare costs, participant experience, and&#xD;
      organizational support. In addition, attracting individuals to DPP and similar lifestyle&#xD;
      change interventions remains a significant challenge and identifying useful approaches is&#xD;
      important.[8-11] Lastly, whereas the effectiveness of in-person DPP is well-established,&#xD;
      prior studies evaluating the effect of digital DPP identified positive outcomes but had&#xD;
      significant methodological limitations, such as a single arm pre- / post-test design and&#xD;
      participant-reported outcomes.[12,13-19]&#xD;
&#xD;
      In 2017 Kaiser Permanente Northwest (KPNW), a large, integrated health system serving Oregon&#xD;
      and southwest Washington, began piloting both digital and in-person versions of DPP for its&#xD;
      adult health plan members with prediabetes and obesity. The purpose of this mixed-methods,&#xD;
      natural experiment is to evaluate this large health system initiative by assessing the&#xD;
      effects of both digital and in-person DPP on change in weight and HbA1c, health behaviors,&#xD;
      and psychosocial factors. Also, sustainability based on cost-effectiveness and patient and&#xD;
      healthcare stakeholder perspectives will be examined.&#xD;
&#xD;
      KPNW patients eligible to participate in DPP (digital or in-person) will be identified and&#xD;
      recruited using the electronic health record (EHR). Both the digital and in-person&#xD;
      (group-based) DPP programs will be delivered over 12 months. Demographic and clinical data to&#xD;
      be included in analyses will also be extracted from the EHR. Behavioral and psychosocial&#xD;
      questionnaires will be administered to DPP enrollees and non-enrollees online using REDCap.&#xD;
      Semi-structured qualitative interviews will be conducted with a subset of DPP enrollees and&#xD;
      non-enrollees to understand reasons for enrollment and likes/dislikes about the program.&#xD;
      Healthcare system providers and stakeholders will also be interviewed to capture factors&#xD;
      related to sustainability of offering DPP within the health system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the primary analysis, investigators plan to model 12- and 24-month weight and HbA1c&#xD;
      trajectories using a linear mixed effects model using time since baseline as the time axis.&#xD;
      Because randomization is not feasible in this real-world implementation of DPP, propensity&#xD;
      score adjustment will be used to control for potential confounding. Furthermore,&#xD;
      investigators will conduct an economic evaluation over the 12-month follow-up period for both&#xD;
      the digital and in-person DPP cohorts as well as over the 24-month period for the digital DPP&#xD;
      cohort from the perspective of the health plan, following best practices,[20] and guided by&#xD;
      previous economic analyses of DPP interventions.[21-26]&#xD;
&#xD;
      The mixed-methods, natural experiment design investigators will use to evaluate KPNW's&#xD;
      implementation of digital and in-person DPP will build on existing evidence related to DPP&#xD;
      effectiveness across the two delivery modes on change in weight and HbA1c over time. In&#xD;
      addition, the cost-effectiveness analysis will determine the impact of digital and in-person&#xD;
      DPP on return on investment for healthcare systems and sustainability of the program.&#xD;
      Findings from our evaluation will therefore inform best practices for implementing and&#xD;
      sustaining DPP within large healthcare systems.&#xD;
