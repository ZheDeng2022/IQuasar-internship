  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pelvic floor failure is a common disorder that can seriously jeopardize woman's quality of&#xD;
      life by causing urinary, fecal incontinence, difficult defecation and pelvic pain. Multiple&#xD;
      congenital and acquired risk factors are associated with pelvic floor failure including&#xD;
      altered collagen metabolism, female sex, vaginal delivery, menopause, and advanced age. A&#xD;
      complex variety of fascial and muscular lesions that range from stretching, insertion&#xD;
      detachment, denervation atrophy, and combinations of pelvic floor relaxation to pelvic organ&#xD;
      prolapse may manifest in a single patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The prevalence of pelvic floor dysfunction increases with age. It is approximately 9.7% in&#xD;
      child bearing period (20-39 yrs), while it reaches up to 49.7% by 80 yrs and older.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thorough preoperative assessment of pelvic floor failure is necessary to reduce the rate of&#xD;
      relapse, which is reported to be as high as 30%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MR imaging is a powerful tool that enables radiologists to comprehensively evaluate pelvic&#xD;
      anatomic and functional abnormalities, thus helping surgeons provide appropriate treatment&#xD;
      and avoid repeat operations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Real time 2D trans-perineal ultrasound is emerging as an exciting new technique for pelvic&#xD;
      floor assessment. It has advantage of providing a global view of the entire pelvic floor,&#xD;
      from the symphysis to the ano-rectum, and includes the lower aspects of the levator ani&#xD;
      muscle, in addition to its lower costs and greater accessibility; also sonographic imaging is&#xD;
      more useful in the clinical environment, and generally better tolerated than MRI.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      135 female patients in child bearing period (20-39 yrs) will undergo trans-perineal US and&#xD;
      dynamic pelvic MRI; 40 days after vaginal delivery or cesarean section for asymptomatic and&#xD;
      symptomatic cases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Revision after six months for cases with sonongraphic or MRI findings. after obtaining an&#xD;
      informed written consent and approval of the ethical committee of faculty of medicine of&#xD;
      Assiut University.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Inclusion criteria: asmptomatic and symptomatic female Patients in child bearing period&#xD;
           40 days after vaginal delivery and cesarean section.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Exclusion criteria: patients with previous pelvic floor surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient preparation&#xD;
&#xD;
      For trans-perineal US:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Patient is positioned in dorsal lithotomy position, with the hips flexed and slightly&#xD;
      abducted and after bladder and bowel emptying. The pelvic tilt can be improved by asking the&#xD;
      patient to place their heels as close as possible to the butÂ¬tocks and move hips towards the&#xD;
      heels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For MRI:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Patient is positioned in supine position and using pelvic coil after bladder and bowel&#xD;
      emptying.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Method:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. trans-perineal US: B mode capable 2D ultrasound system with cine loop function, 3.5-6.0&#xD;
           MHz curved array transducer. A mid-sagittal and axial views is obtained by placing a&#xD;
           transducer on the perineum (Parting of the labia can improve image quality).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Dynamic MRI:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging of the pelvic floor is a two-step process that includes:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis of anatomic damage on axial, coronal and sagittal fast spin-echo (FSE) T2-weighted&#xD;
      images.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Functional evaluation using sagittal dynamic single-shot T2-weighted sequences during&#xD;
      straining and defecation.&#xD;
