    <description>An adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence in a participant or clinical trial participant, temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product. Treatment emergent adverse event (TEAE) is an AE occurring on or after the first dose of study medication or worsening during treatment period.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have either:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. completed the base trial and have shown a clinical benefit of SD or better and&#xD;
                  have never met any withdrawal criteria as defined in the tisotumab vedotin base&#xD;
                  protocol, or&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. not completed treatment as defined in the base protocol for reasons that are not&#xD;
                  considered critical and unmanageable for the safety of the patient (as evaluated&#xD;
                  by the investigator and/or the sponsor) and the patient clearly showed response&#xD;
                  of PR or better.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must not have experienced radiographic disease progression or clinical signs&#xD;
             of symptoms of instability requiring urgent intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must not have received any other anti-cancer treatment (including surgery,&#xD;
             radiation or systemic chemotherapy) since the base trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Acceptable renal function&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Acceptable liver function&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Acceptable hematological status&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 or 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A negative serum pregnancy test (if female and aged between 18-55 years old).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients, both females and males, of reproductive potential must agree to use adequate&#xD;
             contraception during and for six months after the last infusion of tisotumab vedotin.&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Adequate contraception for women is defined as hormonal birth control or an&#xD;
                  intrauterine device (safe hormonal contraceptives include contraceptive pills,&#xD;
                  implants, transdermal patches, hormonal vaginal devices or injections with&#xD;
                  prolonged release). In countries where two highly effective methods of&#xD;
                  contraception are required this will be an inclusion criterion.&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Male patients must be willing to use a latex condom during any sexual contact&#xD;
                  with females of childbearing potential during and for six months after the last&#xD;
                  infusion of tisotumab vedotin, even after having undergone a successful&#xD;
                  vasectomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. In order to be considered as sterilized or infertile, a patient must have&#xD;
                  undergone surgical sterilization (vasectomy/bilateral tubectomy; hysterectomy and&#xD;
                  bilateral ovariectomy) or be postmenopausal (12 months or more with no period&#xD;
                  prior to enrolment).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Following receipt of verbal and written information about the trial, patients must&#xD;
             provide signed informed consent before any trial-related activity is carried out.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Acceptable coagulation status as defined in the applicable base protocol&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. GEN701: Acceptable coagulation status: International normalized ratio (INR) ≤ 1.2&#xD;
                  (without anticoagulant therapy), and activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT)&#xD;
                  ≤ 1.25 ULN; patients on stable doses of therapeutic anti-coagulative treatment&#xD;
                  for ≥ 8 weeks (e.g., warfarin) must have an INR &lt; 3.&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. GEN702: Acceptable coagulation status defined as: INR ≤ 1.2 (without&#xD;
                  anticoagulant therapy), and aPTT ≤ ULN.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Presence of CTCAE (Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events) grade ≥ 2&#xD;
             peripheral neuropathy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Clinically significant active viral, bacterial or fungal infection requiring:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Intravenous treatment with anti-infective therapy that has been administered less&#xD;
                  than two weeks prior to first dose in this trial, or&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Oral treatment with anti-infective therapy that has been administered less than&#xD;
                  one week prior to first dose in this trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. Prophylactic anti-infective therapy, which is given without clinical symptoms is&#xD;
                  allowed.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ongoing acute or chronic inflammatory skin disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Women who are breast feeding.&#xD;

      <recruitment_details>All participants entered the trial following completion of other tisotumab vedotin trials such as GEN701 and GEN702. A total of 5 participants took part in the trial at 3 sites in the United Kingdom and 1 site in the United States from 23 August 2017 to 10 January 2019.</recruitment_details>

          <description>Tisotumab vedotin was administered as an intravenous (IV) infusion on Day 1 of each 21-day cycle (once every 3 weeks). The trial ran until the investigator determined that the participant was no longer benefiting from treatment (ie, disease progression or unacceptable toxicity had occurred), the trial was terminated by the sponsor, or the participant withdrew consent.

        <description>An adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence in a participant or clinical trial participant, temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product. Treatment emergent adverse event (TEAE) is an AE occurring on or after the first dose of study medication or worsening during treatment period.</description>
