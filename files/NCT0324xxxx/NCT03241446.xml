&#xD;
          5. The subject has active RA as determined by the Clinical Disease Activity Index score&#xD;
             of ≥ 10 and have ≥ 2 swollen joints.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. If the subject is receiving methotrexate, they have been at a stable dose for &gt; 4&#xD;
             weeks prior to the Day 1 visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. If the subject is receiving biologic therapy or other DMARDs, they have been at a&#xD;
             stable dose &gt; 8 weeks prior to the Day 1 visit.&#xD;

&#xD;
          9. Aside from being diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis, subjects must be in good health,&#xD;
             as determined by medical history, physical examination, vital sign assessment, 12 lead&#xD;
             electrocardiogram (ECG) and clinical laboratory evaluations.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. The subject is pregnant or lactating.&#xD;

&#xD;
          5. The subject has participated in a radiolabeled investigational study drug trial within&#xD;
             3 months prior to Day 1&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. The subject has exceeded yearly radioactive dose of 30 millisieverts (mSv)&#xD;

             nicotine lozenges, or nicotine gum) within 6 months prior to Day 1, or positive&#xD;
             cotinine screen&#xD;
&#xD;

             days prior to Day 1, unless deemed acceptable by the Investigator;&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. The subject has poor peripheral venous access;&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. The subject has donated blood within 30 days prior to Day 1, or plasma within 2 weeks&#xD;
             prior to Day 1&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. The subject has received blood products within 2 months prior to Day 1;&#xD;
&#xD;
         14. The subject has any acute or chronic condition that, in the opinion of the&#xD;
