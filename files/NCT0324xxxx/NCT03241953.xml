      In this randomized, controlled study, 18 patients with peri-implantitis were included. A&#xD;
      total of forty dental implants were debrided with either ultrasonic instruments (test, n=20)&#xD;
      or plastic scaler (control, n=20). Gingival recession depth (RD), keratinized tissue width&#xD;
      (KTW), probing depth (PD), Gingival Index (GI) were evaluated at baseline and after 6 months.&#xD;
      CBCT radiographs were used to evaluate peri-implant bone loss. Supportive and nonsurgical&#xD;
      periodontal therapies were firstly consulted to reduce the inflammation, occurring due to the&#xD;
      surgical treatments of the defects. The formation of bacterial biofilm on implant surfaces&#xD;
      was removed by ultrasonic scaler and air polishing using abrasive powders or conventional&#xD;
      plastic scaler with klorhegsidin combination.&#xD;

      Subject selection 18 systemically healthy patients, who applied to the Department of&#xD;
      Periodontology, Necmettin Erbakan University and whose at least 1 dental implant was&#xD;
      diagnosed by peri-implantitis and who has never taken peri-implantitis therapy, were included&#xD;
      in the study. All patients were informed about the study and given informed consent form, and&#xD;
      only volunteers were included. The research was conducted in accordance with the principles&#xD;
      outlined in the Declaration of Helsinki. This prospective clinical study was approved by the&#xD;
      Research Ethics Committee of Necmettin Erbakan University.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients, who were systemically and periodontally healthy and free of parafunctional&#xD;
      habits like bruxism, and didn't have any kind of periodontal therapy within the previous year&#xD;
      and had implants for at least 5 years, were included in the study. In addition, the inclusion&#xD;
      criteria were as follows: having pocket depth over 5mm in implants diagnosed by&#xD;
      peri-implantitis (Figure 1), having no mobility, having bone loss in implant site that is&#xD;
      needed for augmentation(Figure 2). The patients with chronic bronchitis or asthma and major&#xD;
      systemic illnesses (i.e. diabetes mellitus, cancer, HIV, bone metabolic diseases or disorders&#xD;
      that compromise wound healing, radiation or immunosuppressive therapy) and those who had&#xD;
      taken antibiotics, anti-inflammatory drugs or other medication within the previous 28 days&#xD;
      were excluded in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      18 patients (mean age 52 years) diagnosed by peri- implantitis were included in this&#xD;
      randomized and controlled study. A total of forty dental implants were debrided with either&#xD;
      standard plastic curettes, debridement made by combined klorhegsidin rinse(control, n=20) or&#xD;
      mechanical debridement made by ultrasonic polyetheretherketone coated tips developed for&#xD;
      implant surface and combined air-flow debridement (test, n=20).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical Measurements The clinical parameters given below were observed on six sites of all&#xD;
      implants: Plaque Index (PlI; Silness &amp; Lo€e 1964), PD, Bleeding upon Probing (BOP) and&#xD;
      Gingival Recession (RD; gingival margin location measuremant cemento- enamel junction to&#xD;
      Gingival marjin).&#xD;
&#xD;
      On six sites of all implants, the following clinical parameters were recorded: Plaque Index&#xD;
      (PlI; Silness &amp; Lo€e 1964), PD, Bleeding on Probing (BOP) and Gingival Recession (RD;&#xD;
      gingival margin location measuremant cemento- enamel junction to Gingival marjin).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Keratinized tissue width (KTW) was measured at buccal midpoint of implants. Bone loss volume&#xD;
      was recorded on con-beam computed tomographs (CBCT) by measuring the distance from bone&#xD;
      implant abutment placement to alveolar bone level. All measurements were taken at the&#xD;
      beginning. As we didn't perform any regenerative operations and didn't want the patients to&#xD;
      be subjected to X-rays again, no more tomographs were taken.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase I Periodontal Therapy Upon the recordings, all patients were given Phase 1 periodontal&#xD;
      therapy and informed about hygiene control. Prior to surgical operation, professional&#xD;
      supragingival and subgingival debridement was performed during 2 or 4 appointments. The&#xD;
      patients with a good level of oral hygiene were included in the study. Oral hygiene controls&#xD;
      were performed in the first, third and sixth months prior to and after operations. Occlusion&#xD;
      controls of all implant supported dental prosthesis were performed, and if present, extreme&#xD;
      contacts were removed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase II Periodontal Therapy 4 weeks after the initial periodontal treatments, for the&#xD;
      treatment of the sites with pocket depth deeper than 5mm, flap operation was performed to&#xD;
      achieve a direct reach to implant surfaces. Around affected implants, intrasulcular incisions&#xD;
      were performed and mucoperiostal flaps with full thickness were raised both buccally and&#xD;
      palatally. Implant surface decontamination is performed using with either plastic curettes or&#xD;
      ultrasonic scaler (Figure 3); In control group, plastic curettes (Hue-Friedy Co., Chicago,&#xD;
      IL, USA) were used for debridement and implant surfaces were decontaminated by klorhegsidin&#xD;
      solution. In test group, sub-gingival operations with ultrasonic scaler was for nearly 20s&#xD;
      per site (EMS Master Piezon LED, implant care system, Nyon, Switzerland). A special design&#xD;
      disposable thermoplastic elastomer nozzle (Perio-flow Nozzle EMS Electro Medical Systems,&#xD;
      Nyon, Sweden.), which horizontally gives out the glycine powder, was utilized.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hand-device (Air-Flows EL-308/A; EMS Electro Medical Systems, Nyon, Sweden) was used in a&#xD;
      circular motion, from coronal to apical, parallel to the implant surface in a noncontact&#xD;
      mode. The operation period time at each aspect (i.e. mesial, distal, vestibular and oral) was&#xD;
      limited to 5 s, as suggested by the manufacturer 35. The nozzle was moved with a&#xD;
      circumferential movement around the implant to cover the entire exposed implant surface (36).&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the debriding of implant surfaces the flap was sutured by 4-0 vicryl. After the&#xD;
      operation, for antimicrobial treatment chlorhexidine was used for 10 days. The sutures were&#xD;
      removed 10 days after the operation and post-operative controls were performed. The patients&#xD;
      were invited to the followups in the first, third and sixth month after the operation.&#xD;
      Clinical and radiographic measurements were repeated every six months&#xD;
