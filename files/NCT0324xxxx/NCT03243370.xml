  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study concerns the validation of a clinical test that aims to reveal &quot;first level&quot;&#xD;
      emotional disorders in neurological diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to bring to light such disorders, it is necessary to begin by establishing reference&#xD;
      values in healthy individuals. This test is based on the priming effect and time estimations.&#xD;
      The test procedure has two successive phases. The first phase aims to determine the judgement&#xD;
      of time inherent to each participant and then to assess whether or not this judgement varies&#xD;
      during the second phase with the introduction of emotional priming. First, we set out to look&#xD;
      for and to calibrate video stimuli able to activate emotions. To this end, we used a battery&#xD;
      of 70 sequences developed recently by Schaefer, Nils, Sanchez and Philippot. We determined&#xD;
      their degree of physiological activation by measuring the electrodermal response at the&#xD;
      laboratory for the exploration of the nervous system in Dijon. These measurements also&#xD;
      allowed us to define and refine our paradigm, notably by deciding at what moment the time&#xD;
      estimation task should be done and by eliminating the influence of attention. We decided to&#xD;
      select only seven video sequences because we noticed a reduction in the measurement effect on&#xD;
      time estimations due to habituation of the subject. We also conducted pre-tests in a control&#xD;
      population made up of twenty men and women aged from 20 to 60 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This brought to light a warp in time estimation opposite to that we found using olfactory&#xD;
      stimuli. This first finding suggests that there are two types of emotion, one which is&#xD;
      anticipative and the other immediately experienced.&#xD;
