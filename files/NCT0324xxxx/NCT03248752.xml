  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to examine the effect of monitoring and sharing physical&#xD;
      activity outcomes (using Fitbit technology) with a domestic partner on physical activity&#xD;
      participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary research question: Does sharing physical activity outcomes from wearable technology&#xD;
      with a participant's partner improve overall physical activity over 3 months compared to not&#xD;
      sharing outcomes? Physical activity will be measured as minutes of moderate to vigorous&#xD;
      physical activity per week.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: Knowledge that physical activity outcomes are visible to a participant's partner&#xD;
      will serve as a proxy-supervision intervention. Awareness of partner's progress will serve as&#xD;
      further motivation. Both factors will improve physical activity adherence in comparison to&#xD;
      participants without shared outcomes.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Background: Physical activity is associated with management and/or prevention of over 25&#xD;
      chronic health conditions; however the majority of adults in North America are not active&#xD;
      enough to experience these benefits. Behavioral strategies have been shown to be effective&#xD;
      for increasing physical activity, and wearable fitness monitors such as Fitbits include&#xD;
      components of several behavioral strategies including goal setting and feedback. While this&#xD;
      technology provides a platform for implementing self-regulation techniques important for&#xD;
      behavior change, direct supervision is still the most effective strategy for behavior change.&#xD;
      Supervised exercise programs and personal trainers may not be accessible or affordable for&#xD;
      people; this study will examine whether proxy supervision by a partner is effective in&#xD;
      changing behavior compared to self-regulation alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Target Population: Sedentary adults aged 45-75 years old living in Victoria,&#xD;
      British-Columbia, Canada.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample Size: 80 participant pairs (160 total participants), 40 pairs per group (80&#xD;
      participants per group).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention: Participants will be randomized to two groups: 1 - Self Monitored, 2 - Partner&#xD;
      monitored. Both groups will receive an intervention with Group 1 (Self monitored) serving as&#xD;
      the comparison group. Participants from both groups will wear an accelerometer for 1 week and&#xD;
      complete an online questionnaire at baseline, 6 weeks, and 3 months. Measures of height,&#xD;
      weight, waist circumference, and resting blood pressure and heart rate will be taken at&#xD;
      baseline and 3 months. Participants will all receive a Fitbit activity tracker and wear it&#xD;
      for 3 months. Group 2 (Partner monitor) participants will also have access to their partner's&#xD;
      daily progress, receive eachother's Weekly Fitbit reports, and engage in a weekly discussion&#xD;
      related to their Weekly Fitbit Report.&#xD;
