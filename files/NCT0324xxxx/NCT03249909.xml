  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Exudate Status From Baseline to Last Visit</measure>
    <time_frame>4 weeks (28 days) or earlier if the wound is dry or healed</time_frame>
    <description>The primary endpoint measures exudate status based on dressing condition in categorical variables: Dry, Moist, Wet, Saturated, Leaking. Analysis of the change in exudate status (Decrease, Equal/Unchanged, Increase) from baseline to 4 weeks in the treatment groups was performed with a two-sided Sign test on the Intent To Treat (ITT) population at significance level 0.05.&#xD;
If a subject had missing values at 4 weeks (Visit 5), last observation carried forward (LOCF) was applied from Visit 2 (1 week). Three subjects treated with Exufiber Ag+ did not have evaluable data: 2 of the subjects did not complete a Visit 2 (1 week) or later visits (both subjects with a chronic wound); 1 subject (with a chronic wound) only completed the investigation until Visit 2, however no exudate status data were reported at Visit 2 for that subject. One subject treated with Exufiber did complete a Visit 2 (1 week) or later visit.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>4-Week Wound Status</measure>
    <time_frame>At 4 weeks (28 days)</time_frame>
    <description>The overall wound status was evaluated by the Nurse/Investigator in ordered, categorical variables (Stagnated, Aggravated, Same as baseline, Improved, Healed), and presented with number of participants at week 4 (28 days).&#xD;
The total number (n) represents the total number of subjects included at the study visit; data were not always recorded for every subject, at every visit, for every data parameter (i.e. some data/answers are missing); Intent to Treat population with available data for this data point at Visit 5, or 4 weeks (28 days), is n=60 for Exufiber Ag+; n=13 for Exufiber; n=12 for Aquacel Ag Extra.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Wound Area Reduction (mm^2)</measure>
    <time_frame>Total treatment period of 4 weeks (28 days) or earlier if the wound is dry or healed</time_frame>
    <description>Wound area was calculated as an ellipse, i.e. Area = (Longest length/2) x (Longest width/2) x π, and was measured by a third-party validated software system. To account for subjects requiring debridement, wound area presented here are pooled data for wounds not debrided and after debridement.&#xD;
The total number (n) represents the total number of subjects included at the study visit with evaluable data; data were not always recorded for every subject, at every visit, for every data parameter (i.e. some data/answers are missing). Intent to Treat population with available data at Visit 5, or 4 weeks (28 days), or earlier if the wound is dry or healed, is n=59 for Exufiber Ag+; n=13 for Exufiber; n=12 for Aquacel Ag Extra.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Frequency of Dressing Changes Between Visits</measure>
    <time_frame>Total treatment period of 4 weeks (28 days) or earlier if the wound is dry or healed</time_frame>
    <description>Frequency of dressing change was evaluated by the Nurse/Investigator. Dressing changes for each dressing were to be performed at least weekly, in line with the IFU and schedule of assessment.&#xD;
Values over 1 indicate dressing changes were required between study follow up visits, for any reason.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Tissue Type of Wound Bed</measure>
    <time_frame>Total treatment period of 4 weeks (28 days) or earlier if the wound is dry or healed</time_frame>
    <description>Measurement of tissue types were collected separately, including necrotic tissue, sloughy tissue, granulation tissue, and epithelialized tissue. The change in percent of tissue type from baseline to 4 weeks are presented with number and percentages.&#xD;
The total number (n) represents the total number of subjects included at the study visit with evaluable data; data were not always recorded for every subject, at every visit, for every data parameter (i.e. some data/answers are missing); Intent to Treat population with available data at Visit 5, or 4 weeks (28 days), or earlier if the wound is dry or healed, is n=61 for Exufiber Ag+; n=13 for Exufiber; n=12 for Aquacel Ag Extra.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Status of the Wound and Peri-wound Skin From Baseline to Last Visit: Malodour</measure>
    <time_frame>Total treatment period of 4 weeks (28 days)</time_frame>
    <description>Malodour was evaluated by the Nurse/Investigator in ordered categorical variables, None, Slight, Moderate, Strong. The Sign test was used for analysis of reported changes within groups from baseline to 4 weeks (Decrease, Equal/Unchanged, Increase), and described with number and percentages of reported changes.&#xD;
The total number (n) represents the total number of subjects included at the study visit; data were not always recorded for every subject, at every visit, for every data parameter (i.e. some data/answers are missing); Intent to Treat (ITT) population with available data to analyze change from baseline to Visit 5, at 4 weeks (28 days), is n=61 for Exufiber Ag+; n=13 for Exufiber; n=12 for Aquacel Ag Extra.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>

    <time_frame>Total treatment period of 4 weeks (28 days)</time_frame>
    <description>Redness/Irritation under and outside the Primary dressing was evaluated by the Nurse/Investigator in and recorded as present (Yes) or not present (No). The Sign test was used for analysis of reported changes within groups from baseline to 4 weeks (Decrease, Equal/Unchanged, Increase), and presented with number and percentages of reported changes.&#xD;
The total number (n) represents the total number of subjects included at the study visit; data were not always recorded for every subject, at every visit, for every data parameter (i.e. some data/answers are missing); Intent to Treat (ITT) population with available data to analyze change from baseline to Visit 5, at 4 weeks (28 days), is n=61 for Exufiber Ag+; n=13 for Exufiber; n=12 for Aquacel Ag Extra.</description>

    <description>Maceration under and outside the Primary dressing was evaluated by the Nurse/Investigator in and recorded as present (Yes) or not present (No). The Sign test was used for analysis of reported changes within groups from baseline to 4 weeks (Decrease, Equal/Unchanged, Increase), and presented with number and percentages of reported changes.&#xD;
The total number (n) represents the total number of subjects included at the study visit; data were not always recorded for every subject, at every visit, for every data parameter (i.e. some data/answers are missing); Intent to Treat (ITT) population with available data to analyze change from baseline to Visit 5, at 4 weeks (28 days), is n=61 for Exufiber Ag+; n=13 for Exufiber; n=12 for Aquacel Ag Extra.</description>

        <title>Change in Exudate Status From Baseline to Last Visit</title>
        <description>The primary endpoint measures exudate status based on dressing condition in categorical variables: Dry, Moist, Wet, Saturated, Leaking. Analysis of the change in exudate status (Decrease, Equal/Unchanged, Increase) from baseline to 4 weeks in the treatment groups was performed with a two-sided Sign test on the Intent To Treat (ITT) population at significance level 0.05.&#xD;
If a subject had missing values at 4 weeks (Visit 5), last observation carried forward (LOCF) was applied from Visit 2 (1 week). Three subjects treated with Exufiber Ag+ did not have evaluable data: 2 of the subjects did not complete a Visit 2 (1 week) or later visits (both subjects with a chronic wound); 1 subject (with a chronic wound) only completed the investigation until Visit 2, however no exudate status data were reported at Visit 2 for that subject. One subject treated with Exufiber did complete a Visit 2 (1 week) or later visit.</description>

The total number (n) represents the total number of subjects included at the study visit; data were not always recorded for every subject, at every visit, for every data parameter (i.e. some data/answers are missing); Intent to Treat population with available data for this data point at Visit 5, or 4 weeks (28 days), is n=60 for Exufiber Ag+; n=13 for Exufiber; n=12 for Aquacel Ag Extra.</description>
