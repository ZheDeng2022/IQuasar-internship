  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This trial aims at determining if dabigatran is effective in the treatment of malignancy&#xD;
      associated VTE. Tolerance and safety of dabigatran will also be assessed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a single armed trial of dabigatran in patients with malignancy associated VTE.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The target recruitment is 99 consecutive patients with active malignancy and newly diagnosed&#xD;
      VTE (deep vein thrombosis and/or pulmonary embolism) in Queen Mary Hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tinzaparin 175 iu/kg daily will be started after the diagnosis of VTE is confirmed (duplex&#xD;
      Doppler ultrasonography for deep vein thrombosis, and computed tomography for pulmonary&#xD;
      embolism), and a written consent is obtained. Patients will be switched to dabigatran 150mg&#xD;
      twice daily from day 6 onwards. The first dose of dabigatran will be given within 2 hours&#xD;
      before the time that the next dose of tinzaparin would have been due. Anticoagulation will be&#xD;
      continued as long as malignancy is active. If patients achieve a complete remission of their&#xD;
      underlying malignancies, dabigatran will be continued for 6 months further.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with malignancies are at increased risks of venous thromboembolism (VTE). The annual&#xD;
      incidence of VTE in cancer patients is 0.5%, which is 5-fold more than the general population&#xD;
      . Low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) has been the standard treatment for&#xD;
      malignancy-associated VTE. This recommendation follows the results of the Randomized&#xD;
      Comparison of Low-Molecular-Weight Heparin versus Oral Anticoagulant Therapy for the&#xD;
      Prevention of Recurrent VenousThromboembolism in Patients with Cancer (CLOT) trial, which&#xD;
      showed superiority of Low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) over warfarin in cancer patients&#xD;
      with VTE .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) has a number of inherent advantages over warfarin. It&#xD;
      does not interact with chemotherapeutic agents, and dose titration is not necessary.&#xD;
      Furthermore, the risks of both bleeding and breakthrough VTE are also lower with LMWH.&#xD;
      However, the requirement of daily subcutaneous injection makes LWMH inconvenient to use. Most&#xD;
      patients have difficulties continuing daily injection, partly owing to compliance issues, but&#xD;
      also because an emaciated state in some patients makes subcutaneous injection painful. As the&#xD;
      life expectancy of solid cancer patients is improved with novel treatment options, the choice&#xD;
      of anticoagulation has become a major issue in the management of VTE in this patient&#xD;
      population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main reason underlying the inferior performance of warfarin in oncology patients is&#xD;
      difficult dose titration. Drug interaction and hepatic dysfunction are common in patients on&#xD;
      chemotherapy. Frequent interruptions of warfarin for invasive procedures and&#xD;
      chemotherapy-induced-thrombocytopenia also lead to fluctuations in anticoagulation level. As&#xD;
      a result, highs risk of recurrence of VTE and bleeding were observed in cancer patients&#xD;
      taking warfarin. Direct-acting oral anticoagulants (DOACs), on the other hand, may be an&#xD;
      attractive alternative treatment to LMWH. They are administered at a fixed dose with&#xD;
      predictable pharmacokinetics, so that therapeutic monitoring is not required. There is&#xD;
      minimal food and drug interaction. They have been shown to be effective in the treatment of&#xD;
      VTE in several pivotal randomized controlled trials in comparison with warfarin . However,&#xD;
      their role in malignancy associated VTE is yet to be determined, because cancer patients were&#xD;
      either excluded or very much underrepresented in these VTE treatment trials. Moreover, the&#xD;
      non-inferiority of DOACs in VTE treatment was only demonstrated against warfarin, which is&#xD;
      already shown to be suboptimal in oncology patients. A trial directly comparing DOACs with&#xD;
      LMWH in malignancy associated VTE is therefore needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dabigatran etexilate is an oral thrombin inhibitor. It was shown in the RECOVER study to be&#xD;
      effective in treatment of VTE and it has a lower bleeding risk than warfarin. It is not&#xD;
      metabolized by cytochrome P450 system and therefore, in contrast to other DOACs, concomitant&#xD;
      administration of CYP3A4 inducers or inhibitors is not a concern.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We propose this prospective single armed trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of&#xD;
      dabigatran in the treatment of malignancy associated VTE. We will compare the result with our&#xD;
      historical control who were treated with LMWH.&#xD;
