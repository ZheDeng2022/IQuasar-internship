      Double-blind, randomised, multi-centre study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of LH-8&#xD;
      cutaneous solution versus placebo in children and adolescents with moderate to severe scalp&#xD;
      alopecia areata.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 2/3 study performed in France, Germany, Bulgaria and India in 100 patients.&#xD;

      Methods / trial design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomised, double-blind, vehicle-controlled multicentre trial in parallel groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At screening (Visit 0), subjects will discontinue their previous treatment for alopecia&#xD;
      areata, if any. Screening period will last up to 28 days. The 24-week treatment phase will&#xD;
      include assessment Visits 1 to 3, which will take place at 12-week intervals. At assessment&#xD;
      Visit 1, eligible subjects will be randomly assigned in a 2:1 ratio to receive LH-8 cutaneous&#xD;
      solution or vehicle (placebo) twice daily for a 24 week treatment period. During the&#xD;
      treatment phase the subjects will complete daily their drug diaries. The post-treatment&#xD;
      safety and efficacy follow-up phase will include Visit 4 and Visit 5, 12 and 24 weeks after&#xD;
      end of treatment, respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects (as applicable) and parents will be instructed to contact the investigator, if an&#xD;
      event on scalp (intolerance) occurs during the treatment or post-treatment period. They may&#xD;
      be asked to come to the site for an unscheduled visit, in order to perform additional&#xD;
      examinations.&#xD;
