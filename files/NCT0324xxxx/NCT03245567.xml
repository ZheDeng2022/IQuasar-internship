  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Implement a Web platform intended to host perceptual learning modules (PLMs)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Implement and assess a PLM designed to improve the capacity of first-year residents and&#xD;
           fourth-year medical students to visually estimate the left ventricular ejection fraction&#xD;
           (LVEF) with transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) images.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis of the study is that the PLM will improve the visual assessment of LVEF by TEE&#xD;
      in junior residents and medical students.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      TEE is increasingly used for perioperative diagnosis and monitoring. However, learning TEE&#xD;
      may be long and difficult: guidelines suggest that learners perform and interpret hundreds of&#xD;
      TEE exams during their training. Even if this learning process has been used successfully for&#xD;
      many years, it has important limitations, especially in the context of an ever-increasing&#xD;
      number of trainees: access to patients and TEE experts is limited, and the extensive period&#xD;
      of time required to train is also a problem.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Simulators have gained popularity as tools for teaching echocardiography, showing benefits&#xD;
      mostly regarding probe handling and image acquisition. Some simulators may also be useful to&#xD;
      replicate some diseases, but most simulators can only replicate a limited variety of&#xD;
      diseases, and mostly typical presentations. This is an important limitation when it comes to&#xD;
      teaching image interpretation. In order to develop their expertise, trainees have to be&#xD;
      exposed to a wide range of normal variations and to more subtle abnormalities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PLMs represent an alternative modality to teach image interpretation, and are already used in&#xD;
      other fields. PLMs are online tools created to enhance the development of pattern&#xD;
      recognition, a skill required to efficiently interpret TEE images. With PLMs, learners&#xD;
      observe a series of images or videoclips and must answer a question about each image in a&#xD;
      short period of time. Each answer is followed by an immediate feedback (the correct answer).&#xD;
      By observing a large number of images online and by receiving systematic and expert feedback,&#xD;
      the trainee quickly learns to extract efficiently the required information from the image.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will aim to evaluate the effects of a PLM on the ability of junior residents and&#xD;
      medical students to correctly estimate visually the left ventricular ejection faction using&#xD;
      TEE images.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A team of experienced programmers will develop a Web platform, which will allow the&#xD;
      identification of both participants and TEE experts, manage the consent process, host the&#xD;
      tests used to assess the participants' expertise and the PLM itself, as well as manage the&#xD;
      TEE images and the study data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The pilot study designed to assess the impact of the PLM on the visual estimation of LVEF&#xD;
      will be composed of the following steps:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. selection and validation of TEE cases,&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. development of two versions of a test and of the PLM,&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. analysis of the impact of the PLM on participants' performance vs a control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each TEE case used in this study will comprise 3 short video loops containing the following&#xD;
      standardised echocardiographic views:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  midesophageal four chamber view&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  midesophageal two chamber view&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  midesophageal long axis view&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior to inclusion in the study, each case will be anonymized and then validated by two&#xD;
      cardiologists expert in TEE interpretation. Only cases where the visual estimation of the&#xD;
      LVEF provided independently by the two TEE experts will differ by no more than 10% will be&#xD;
      used. Two different sets of validated images will then be created.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first set will be comprised of two groups of 20 validated cases (total of 40 cases).&#xD;
      These cases will be used to create two versions of a test used to assess participants'&#xD;
      expertise in the visual estimation of LVEF at different stages in the research protocol.&#xD;
      These cases will not be part of the PLM.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The second set will be comprised of 96 validated cases destined to the PLM. The PLM is&#xD;
      designed not to assess the participants' expertise, but to develop their ability to estimate&#xD;
      LVEF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When taking a test on the platform, participants will see the three short video loops of each&#xD;
      case simultaneously on the screen for a maximum of 20 seconds, and will then have to provide&#xD;
      an estimation of the LVEF. Each answer will be followed immediately by another case, and no&#xD;
      feedback will be provided.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When doing the PLM, participants will see the three short video loops of each case&#xD;
      simultaneously on the screen for a maximum of 20 seconds, and will then have to provide an&#xD;
      estimation of the LVEF. However, each answer will be followed by feedback in the form of the&#xD;
      average value of the experts' visual estimates of LVEF. This sequence of &quot;case visualisation&#xD;
      - participant estimation - expert feedback&quot; will be repeated 96 times during this PLM.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Residents and medical students will be randomised by the platform to a Control Group and a&#xD;
      PLM group. Both groups will participate in two on-line sessions. During the first session,&#xD;
      demographic and clinical experience data will be collected. All participants will also&#xD;
      perform a pretest to measure their baseline ability to estimate LVEF. Then only the&#xD;
      participants randomised to the PLM group will do the PLM. All participants will do a posttest&#xD;
      at the end of the first session. Six months later, all participants will return for a second&#xD;
      session to perform the delayed test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of the study, participants of the Control group will be allowed to complete the&#xD;
      PLM if they wish to.&#xD;
