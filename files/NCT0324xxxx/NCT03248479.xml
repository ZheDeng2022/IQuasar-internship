      The primary objectives of this study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To confirm the safety and tolerability of magrolimab monotherapy in a&#xD;
           relapsed/refractory (R/R) acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and myelodysplastic syndrome&#xD;
           (MDS) population, and of magrolimab in combination with azacitidine in previously&#xD;
           untreated participants with AML or MDS and participants with R/R AML and MDS&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the efficacy of magrolimab monotherapy in R/R AML/MDS, and of magrolimab in&#xD;
           combination with azacitidine in previously untreated participants with AML/MDS, or R/R&#xD;
           AML/MDS as measured by complete remission (CR) rate for participants with AML and&#xD;
           higher-risk MDS, and duration of complete response for participants with AML and&#xD;
           higher-risk MDS, and duration of CR for participants with AML and higher-risk MDS&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of magrolimab monotherapy or&#xD;
           combination with azacitidine in low-risk MDS participants as measured by red blood cell&#xD;
