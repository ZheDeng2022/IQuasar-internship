  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Around the world, the prevalence of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) has been increasing since&#xD;
      the last two decades, with approximately 347 million patients with diabetes by 2013 according&#xD;
      to the World Health Organization (WHO). This pronounced increase is due to an increase in the&#xD;
      prevalence of obesity, reduction in physical activity levels, accelerated urbanization and&#xD;
      aging of the population. In Colombia, T2DM ranks fifth in the main morbidity and mortality&#xD;
      causes, including only deaths caused directly and without adding the strong influence that&#xD;
      T2DM has on cardiovascular disease mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Insufficient tissue response to normal insulin concentrations, called insulin resistance, is&#xD;
      one of the central pathophysiological mechanisms in the development of T2DM. However, there&#xD;
      is currently no simple, practical, safe and reproducible method that allows the diagnosis or&#xD;
      identification of insulin resistance, nor the follow-up to its evolution. At the moment, the&#xD;
      gold standard for assessing the degree of insulin sensitivity or resistance is the&#xD;
      &quot;hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp&quot;, a laborious technique, of high cost and high technical&#xD;
      difficulty, requiring specialized personnel and hospitalization. Non-invasive methods based&#xD;
      on mathematical regressions, such as the Homeostatic Model Assessment (HOMA-IR), are&#xD;
      imperfect and widely variable, and have not been validated in the Latin American population,&#xD;
      less Still Colombian.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, the development of new, easily obtainable quantitative tools for the diagnosis of&#xD;
      insulin resistance is required. This requires not only the identification of new and better&#xD;
      biomarkers, but also the determination of their diagnostic performance and operational&#xD;
      characteristics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This project will investigate 3 molecular targets (myokines), novel and easy to measure, with&#xD;
      high probability of being good biomarkers of insulin resistance. The research will include&#xD;
      validation of its association with insulin resistance measured by the reference method, as&#xD;
      well as its measurement in apparently healthy individuals. Finally, operator-receiver&#xD;
      characteristics of each test will be analyzed, in order to propose a cutoff point for the&#xD;
      diagnosis of insulin resistance.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>

      The objectives of the project are: 1) To identify, within a group of 3 potential new&#xD;
      biomarkers of insulin resistance, those that are significantly associated with the presence&#xD;
      of this phenomenon in our population, 2) Establish, analyze and apply reference values for&#xD;
      each one of these three biomarkers in Colombian population. 3) To evaluate the sensitivity,&#xD;
      specificity, statistical C (operational performance), predictive values and likelihood ratios&#xD;
      of each of the biomarkers studied for the diagnosis of insulin resistance versus a standard&#xD;
      gold technique and 4) Different biomarkers evaluated, in order to select the best one (s) for&#xD;
      clinical use, as well as to propose a cutoff point for detection of insulin resistance for&#xD;
      each of them.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology: A cross-sectional, diagnostic test evaluation study will be conducted, including&#xD;
      apparently healthy Adults of both sexes, with ages between 35 and 65 years, coming from&#xD;
      Bogot√°, without any significant comorbidity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As initial evaluation will be carried out measurement of height, weight, percentage of body&#xD;
      fat, blood pressure, diet questionnaire, physical activity and sociocultural characteristics.&#xD;
      For patients with prediabetes and T2DM, the time elapsed since the diagnosis will be&#xD;
      obtained, as well as information about pharmacological or non-pharmacological treatment that&#xD;
      they are receiving.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the serological evaluation, a sample of venous blood should be taken in the fasted state,&#xD;
      with the aim of measuring the following markers: Fibroblast Growth Factor 21 (FGF21) ,&#xD;
      Myonectin, and Myostatin. In addition to routine tests such as fasting glycemia, glycosylated&#xD;
      hemoglobin, fasting insulinemia, lipid profile (total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol,&#xD;
      triglycerides, LDL-C) and C-reactive protein. Additionally, all subjects will participate in&#xD;
      an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to the gold standard of measurement of insulin resistance&#xD;
      (hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp), six of the tools currently available for the search of&#xD;
      insulin resistance, all derived from calculations from the measurements of The HOMA beta-cell&#xD;
      function (HOMA beta-cell%), insulin sensitivity index (ISI), index 1 / fasting insulin,&#xD;
      corrected insulin response, insulin / glucose ratio and insulinemia Of fasting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For each biomarker, an operator / receiver characteristics curve (ROC curve) will be&#xD;
      calculated, calculating diagnostic performance and cutoff points with the best combination of&#xD;
      sensitivity and specificity. A first approximation will be made to baseline values for these&#xD;
      tests, based on the distribution of the tests in healthy, and one or more insulin resistance&#xD;
      biomarkers with their recommended cutoff points will be proposed.&#xD;
