      This pilot study examines the feasibility and acceptability of transitioning office-based&#xD;
      buprenorphine treatment of opioid use disorder from physicians to pharmacists. Results from&#xD;
      this study will inform the development of a future multi-site randomized clinical trial.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The overall objective of this study is to explore the feasibility of transitioning the care&#xD;
      of adult patients with opioid use disorder (OUD) who receive office-based buprenorphine&#xD;
      treatment (OBBT) from physicians to pharmacists. Physicians will induce buprenorphine&#xD;
      treatment and complete the stabilization phase before referring patients to pharmacists for&#xD;
      the management of monthly maintenance visits. This study will assess the feasibility and&#xD;
      acceptability of a collaborative care model between physician and pharmacist by measuring&#xD;
      recruitment rate, treatment retention rate, treatment compliance rate, and participants'&#xD;
      substance use. Other assessments measured will include treatment fidelity, participant,&#xD;
      physician, and pharmacist satisfaction with OUD care, participant safety, and the&#xD;
      pharmacists' use of electronic health records and the Prescription Drug Monitoring Program.&#xD;

    <description>To relieve opioid withdrawal symptoms and craving, buprenorphine/naloxone will be prescribed by the study-physician and dispensed by the study-pharmacist on a monthly basis. The median expected dose is 16 mg daily, though adjustment by the study physician may be needed due to increased withdrawal and craving from previous study visits. Medication will be provided in the form of a sublingual film.</description>
