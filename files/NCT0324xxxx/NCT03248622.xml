      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment of some diseases can suppress the immune system. This can cause other conditions to&#xD;
      reactivate. Recent cases have shown that hepatitis B virus (HBV) reactivates in people who&#xD;
      had already recovered from it during treatment for chronic hepatitis C (CHC). Their treatment&#xD;
      was direct-acting antiviral (DAA) agents. Researchers want to see how common this&#xD;
      reactivation is. They want to learn what the effects are. They will study data that have&#xD;
      already been collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To study HBV reactivation in people with CHC and resolved HBV infection who are being treated&#xD;
      with interferon-free DAA-based therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data were collected from adults 18 and older in studies that were done in 2012 and 2016.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Researchers will screen the records from the previous studies. They will identify&#xD;
      participants who had HBV infection before they got DAA-based treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Researchers will take data from those records. This will include data on:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Age, sex, race, and ethnicity&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Treatment and disease status&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Lab results&#xD;
&#xD;
      Researchers will test stored samples. They will test samples that were taken before, during,&#xD;
      and after treatment. They will check if HBV was reactivated. They will also check if other&#xD;
      clinical outcomes occurred.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Reactivation of hepatitis B is well known to occur with immunosuppression as in the setting&#xD;
      of high dose immunosuppressive therapy, cancer chemotherapy and bone marrow or stem cell&#xD;
      transplantation. It is usually subclinical but at times can manifest as an acute hepatitis,&#xD;
      hepatic decompensation and death. Often times this leads to interruption of cancer&#xD;
      chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently, several case reports and case series have revealed evidence of hepatitis B virus&#xD;
      (HBV) reactivation in previously recovered persons being treated for chronic hepatitis C&#xD;
      (CHC) with direct-acting antiviral (DAA) agents. Given the severity of some cases, the U.S.&#xD;
      Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has issued a Black Box warning regarding the risk of HBV&#xD;
      reactivation to HCV DAA labeling to screen all hepatitis C patients for HBV before initiation&#xD;
      of therapy and to monitor those with previous HBV infection for signs of reactivation while&#xD;
      on treatment. However, since the FDA warning, retrospective experiences on clinical trials&#xD;
      have failed to reveal evidence of viral reactivation. Further, the frequency of HBV&#xD;
      reactivation and its risk factors and monitoring frequency in HCV patients receiving&#xD;
      Interferon-free DAA therapy are yet unknown. Hence, we aim to conduct a multicenter&#xD;
      retrospective analysis to investigate these issues.&#xD;
