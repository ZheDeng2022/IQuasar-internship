      Preventing contextual errors requires heightening clinician responsiveness to clues that&#xD;
      there are contextual factors during the clinical encounter, in real time. These clues, termed&#xD;
      contextual red flags are evident in two sources: the medical record and from patients&#xD;
      directly. An effective intervention would prompt clinicians to determine whether there are&#xD;
      underlying contextual factors that could be addressed in the care plan, averting contextual&#xD;
      error. This desirable process is termed contextual probing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While clinical decision support (CDS) has been used to provide physicians with timely&#xD;
      biomedical information at the point of care to prevent errors and promote appropriate care,&#xD;
      this technology also affords an opportunity to draw physician attention to both contextual&#xD;
      red flags and contextual factors in order to avert contextual errors. This study assesses the&#xD;
      potential of &quot;contextualized CDS&quot; to improve contextualization of care through a randomized&#xD;
      controlled intervention trial, with assessment measures of both patient health care outcomes&#xD;
      and averted costs associated with overuse and misuse of medical services. The three&#xD;
      hypotheses are that CDS:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Reduces contextual error: CDS tools that inform clinicians of contextual factors and&#xD;
           prompt them to explore contextual red flags should result in a reduction in contextual&#xD;
           error.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Improve health care outcomes: Contextualized CDS predicts improved health care outcomes&#xD;
           defined as a partial or full resolution of the contextual red flag (e.g. elevated HgB&#xD;
           A1c) after the index visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Reduces avoidable health care costs: Contextualized CDS is associated with a reduction&#xD;
           in misuse and overuse of inappropriate or unnecessary medical services.&#xD;

      The term patient context refers to the myriad contextual factors in patients' lives that&#xD;
      complicate the application of research evidence to patient care. For instance, the inability&#xD;
      of a patient to afford a medication for a particular condition is a contextual factor.&#xD;
      Contextual factors can be addressed when correctly identified. Substituting a low cost&#xD;
      generic for a high cost brand name medication may enable a patient to afford a medication.&#xD;
      Addressing contextual factors in a care plan is termed contextualizing care. Conversely, the&#xD;
      failure to address a contextual factor when it is feasible to so is a contextual error,&#xD;
      because it results in an inappropriate plan of care. In sum, contextual errors are medical&#xD;
      errors caused by inattention to patient context. They are common and linked to both&#xD;
      diminished health care outcomes and an increase in health care costs related to overuse and&#xD;
      misuse of medical services. These findings were determined using a validated method for&#xD;
      coding audio recorded data called Content Coding for Contextualization of Care (&quot;4C&quot;)&#xD;
      collected during the encounters by both real patients, and by unannounced standardized&#xD;
      patients (USPs) employing checklists.&#xD;

        3. Reduces avoidable health care costs: Contextualized CDS is associated with a reduction&#xD;
           in misuse and overuse of inappropriate or unnecessary medical services.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To test the hypotheses, patients who consent to participate will be randomized to usual care&#xD;
      or care enhanced with contextualized CDS. Participants will audio record their visits, and&#xD;
      the data will be coded using 4C. They will be followed several months after the index visit&#xD;
      for assessment of outcomes by blinded assessors using an established tracking method. In&#xD;
      addition, USPs presenting with cases containing complicating contextual factors that if&#xD;
      overlooked result in overuse and misuse of medical services, will be employed to assess the&#xD;
      third hypothesis, and to supplement the data obtained by observing the effects of contextual&#xD;
      alerts on the care of real patients for the first hypothesis.&#xD;
