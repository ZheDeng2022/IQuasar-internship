      The study aims to improve patient-specific anatomical targeting of the Deep Brain Stimulation&#xD;
      for the treatment of intractable OCD.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Recently, deep brain stimulation (DBS) has emerged as a potentially circuit-specific&#xD;
      treatment for intractable OCD. DBS is programmable, allowing the clinician to &quot;reshape&quot; the&#xD;
      volume of tissue activated within the standard ventral capsule/ventral striatum (VC/VS)&#xD;
      target.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, VC/VS DBS' efficacy is limited by two major factors: imperfect targeting and a lack&#xD;
      of decision rules for stimulation adjustment. The VC/VS target is not a single identifiable&#xD;
      structure, but encompasses white matter of the internal capsule and gray matter of the&#xD;
      nucleus accumbens (NAc). In current practice for DBS in OCD, all patients are implanted at&#xD;
      standard x,y,z coordinates in the VC/VS region. Due to this inter-subject anatomical&#xD;
      variability, different fiber tracts are stimulated by ostensibly the &quot;same&quot; parameters in&#xD;
      each subject, leading to variable outcomes. This investigation will identify aspects of VC/VS&#xD;
      circuitry that may determine clinical response. The hypothesis is that good clinical outcomes&#xD;
      may correlate to electrical field capture of either striatal gray matter or of white matter&#xD;
      fibers connecting OFC to thalamus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The current study looks to extend the neuroimaging investigation using anatomic white matter&#xD;
      targeting, functional gray matter targeting and changes in changes in regional glucose&#xD;
      metabolism of Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) in severe obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) with&#xD;
      the long-term aim of identifying biomarkers that could improve outcomes of this expensive and&#xD;
      invasive therapy. Improved imaging would allow surgeons to place the DBS lead closer to the&#xD;
      biological targets, thus improving efficacy of the treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objectives of this study are threefold:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Improve the anatomic white matter targeting of the Deep Brain Stimulator (DBS) implant&#xD;
           by tracing and identifying fibers of passage within the Ventral Capsule (VC) white&#xD;
           matter using advance tractography methods in preoperative diffusion MRI data.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Improve functional gray matter targeting by studying the overlap of the volume of tissue&#xD;
           activated (VTA) with the VC voxels of maximal preoperative connectivity to the&#xD;
           orbitofrontal cortex (OFC)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine the changes in regional glucose metabolism using preoperative and&#xD;
           post-treatment FDG-PET (Positron Emission Tomography) following 3 months of DBS&#xD;
           treatment&#xD;

        Subjects will be 11 patients with DSM-5-defined OCD of disabling severity, refractory to&#xD;
        prolonged treatment trials with conventional medication and behavioral therapy, who would&#xD;
        therefore otherwise be candidates for psychiatric neurosurgery.&#xD;
