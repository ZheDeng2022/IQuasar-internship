    <textblock>
      This is an open-label pilot study to determine the safety and tolerability of infusions of&#xD;
      autologous CD4+ CD25+ regulatory T cells with concomitant subcutaneous IL-2 injections in 4&#xD;
      subjects with ALS.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This Pilot Study will consist of 4 ALS subjects who will undergo 4 infusions of autologous&#xD;
      expanded Tregs with concomitant subcutaneous injections of IL-2 (2 x 105 IU/m2) 3 times&#xD;
      weekly for 52 weeks or at least until such time that interim analyses can confirm or negate&#xD;
      its benefit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the enrollment period up to four subjects will be recruited from patients known to our&#xD;
      clinic for screening, baseline measures and leukapheresis. The Treg cell manufacturing will&#xD;
      be performed in a GMP laboratory. The first subject will receive infusions of their expanded&#xD;
      Tregs (1x106 /kg) with concomitant subcutaneous IL-2 injections (2 x 105 IU/m2) 25 days (+/-&#xD;
      2 days) post leukapheresis. The 2nd subject will begin after the first subject has completed&#xD;
      the first 4 weeks and has experienced no untoward effects during this period. Once subjects&#xD;
      #1 and #2 have completed the first 4 weeks and no toxic events have occurred they will&#xD;
      therefore be considered safely past the first milestone and subject #3 will begin infusions.&#xD;
      After subject #3 has completed the first 4 weeks with no untoward effects, subject #4 may&#xD;
      begin infusions with the below modified schedule:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The 4th subject will undergo infusion of autologous expanded Tregs once every four weeks (+/-&#xD;
      2 days) for a total of four infusions, with concomitant subcutaneous injections of IL-2 (2 x&#xD;
      105 IU/m2) 3 times weekly. In addition, subject #4 will begin subcutaneous IL-2 injections 4&#xD;
      weeks before his first autologous Treg infusion. An additional office visit will take place 2&#xD;
      weeks after initiating IL-2 for clinical evaluation, scoring and blood draw. Office visits&#xD;
      will then be completed every two weeks while the subject is receiving Treg infusions for&#xD;
      clinical evaluation, scoring, and blood draws. Then, the subject will be seen in office&#xD;
      visits once per month for one year total for clinical evaluation, scoring, and blood draws.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, subjects #1, 2 and 3 will repeat the leukapheresis (under a separate protocol)&#xD;
      and undergo Treg infusions at the modified schedule of every 4 weeks, with concomitant&#xD;
      subcutaneous injections of IL-2 (2 x 105 IU/m2) 3 times weekly. The subjects will be called&#xD;
      on Day 7, and 21. Office visits will be completed on the day after infusions and every two&#xD;
      weeks while the subjects are undergoing Treg infusions for clinical evaluation, scoring, and&#xD;
      blood draws. The subjects will then be seen during office visits once per month for one year&#xD;
      total from their initial baseline visit for clinical evaluation, scoring, and blood draws&#xD;
&#xD;
      Monthly interim analyses will monitor the subjects using validated ALS scales such as the&#xD;
      ALSFRS-R and Appel Scale, which incorporates muscle strength and dysfunction, activities of&#xD;
      daily living and pulmonary function. The analyses will also include interim medical history&#xD;
      and physical exam, EKG when indicated, safety labs (such as CBC, chemistry, liver function,&#xD;
      T4 and TSH) as well as more technical research labs such as T Regulatory Cell, Th1 and Th17&#xD;
      counts, FoxP3 RNA expression, and Treg Suppression Assays. A PT/PTT will be performed only if&#xD;
      the subject has an abnormal coagulation result at baseline or if the subject is on&#xD;
      anti-coagulation therapy.&#xD;

    <description>The AALS is a published, validated instrument that consists of five sub-scores: bulbar, respiratory, muscle strength, and lower extremity and upper extremity function. Each group is composed of individual tests. The total Appel ALS score is 30 for healthy subjects and 164 for those with maximum impairment. The rate of change in the Appel ALS Rating Scale is a significant predictor of survival for subjects with ALS.</description>
