  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research study is studying nivolumab, an investigational drug, in combination with&#xD;
      ipilimumab, also an investigational drug, as a possible treatment for thyroid cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The drugs involved in this study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Nivolumab (Opdivo™)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Ipilimumab (Yervoy™)&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This research study is a Phase 2 clinical trial. Phase 2 clinical trials test the safety and&#xD;
      effectiveness of an investigational intervention to learn whether the intervention works in&#xD;
      treating a specific disease. &quot;Investigational&quot; means that the intervention is being studied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate effectiveness (how well the drug/s work) of&#xD;
      nivolumab combined with ipilimumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nivolumab and ipilimumab are types of immunotherapy. Immunotherapy works by encouraging the&#xD;
      body's own immune system to attack cancer cells. Nivolumab has been approved by the US Food&#xD;
      and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of metastatic melanoma (a type of skin&#xD;
      cancer), and specific types of previously treated advanced lung and kidney cancers.&#xD;
      Ipilimumab is approved by the FDA for the treatment of metastatic melanoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The combination of nivolumab and ipilimumab is now FDA approved as treatment for patients&#xD;
      with metastatic melanoma. However, the use of nivolumab as well as ipilimumab alone or in&#xD;
      combination for the treatment of patients with thyroid cancer is not approved&#xD;

        Inclusion&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Metastatic, RAI refractory, differentiated thyroid cancer (including papillary and&#xD;
             follicular thyroid cancer and their sub-types such as Hurthle cell thyroid cancer as&#xD;
             well as poorly differentiated thyroid cancer), with progression within 13 months prior&#xD;
             to study registration. RAI refractoriness is defined as absence of uptake of RAI on&#xD;
             either a low-dose diagnostic test or a post-treatment RAI scan in measurable lesions&#xD;
             or radiographic progression of disease within 12 months of the last course of RAI&#xD;
             treatment despite the recorded uptake of RAI with that previous therapy or having a&#xD;
             cumulative lifetime administered dose of greater than 600mCi.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Exploratory cohort: incurable medullary thyroid cancer with prior tyrosine kinase&#xD;
             inhibitor (TKI) failure and progression within 13 months prior to enrollment (10&#xD;
             patients) and anaplastic thyroid cancer (7 patients)&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Women of childbearing potential (WOCBP) must use appropriate method(s) of&#xD;
             contraception. WOCBP should use an adequate method to avoid pregnancy for 23 weeks (30&#xD;
             days plus the time required for nivolumab to undergo five half-lives) after the last&#xD;
             dose of investigational drug&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Women of childbearing potential must have a negative serum or urine pregnancy test&#xD;
             (minimum sensitivity 25 iu/l or equivalent units of hcg) within 24 hours of the first&#xD;
             dose of the study drug&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Women of childbearing potential&quot; is defined as any female who has experienced menarche&#xD;
             and who has not undergone surgical sterilization (hysterectomy or bilateral&#xD;
             oophorectomy) or who is not postmenopausal. Menopause is defined clinically as 12&#xD;
             months of amenorrhea in a woman over 45 in the absence of other biological or&#xD;
             physiological causes. In addition, women under the age of 55 must have a documented&#xD;
             serum follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) level less than 40 mIU/mL.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Men who are sexually active with WOCBP must use any contraceptive method with a&#xD;
             failure rate of less than 1% per year Men receiving nivolumab and who are sexually&#xD;
             active with WOCBP will be instructed to adhere to contraception for a period of 31&#xD;
             weeks after the last dose of investigational product Women who are not of childbearing&#xD;
             potential (ie, who are postmenopausal or surgically sterile as well as azoospermic men&#xD;
             do not require contraception&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients should be excluded if they have an active, known or suspected autoimmune&#xD;
             disease. Subjects are permitted to enroll if they have vitiligo, type I diabetes&#xD;
             mellitus, residual hypothyroidism due to autoimmune condition only requiring hormone&#xD;
             replacement, psoriasis not requiring systemic treatment, or conditions not expected to&#xD;
             recur in the absence of an external trigger&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients should be excluded if they have a condition requiring systemic treatment with&#xD;
             either corticosteroids (&gt; 10 mg daily prednisone equivalents) or other&#xD;
             immunosuppressive medications within 14 days of study drug administration. Inhaled or&#xD;
             topical steroids and adrenal replacement doses &gt; 10 mg daily prednisone equivalents&#xD;
             are permitted in the absence of active autoimmune disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  As there is potential for hepatic toxicity with nivolumab or nivolumab/ipilimumab&#xD;
             combinations, drugs with a predisposition to hepatoxicity should be used with caution&#xD;
             in patients treated with nivolumab-containing regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have had chemotherapy or radiotherapy within 4 weeks (6 weeks for&#xD;
             nitrosoureas or mitomycin C) prior to entering the study or those who have not&#xD;
             recovered from adverse events due to agents administered more than 4 weeks earlier.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who are receiving any other investigational agents.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with activebrain metastases should be excluded from this clinical trial&#xD;
             because of their poor prognosis and because they often develop progressive neurologic&#xD;
             dysfunction that would confound the evaluation of neurologic and other adverse events.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active&#xD;
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac&#xD;
             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with&#xD;
             study requirements.&#xD;
