  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to develop a feasible and safe regimen for minimization of&#xD;
      immune suppression in recipients of vascularized composite allotransplants (VCA) using a&#xD;
      daily dose of recombinant IL-2. In order to achieve this aim, this trial will:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Perform VCA in 5 eligible subjects;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Administer recombinant IL-2 at a low-dose to promote the expansion and function of&#xD;
           regulatory T cells in subjects who received VCA; and&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Minimize immune suppression to tacrolimus single therapy in subjects who received VCA&#xD;
           and recombinant IL-2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This trial will also investigate if it is possible to predict immune rejection in VCA using&#xD;
      blood and tissue samples from recipients of VCA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lastly, this trial will develop non-invasive technologies to monitor for VCA rejection. These&#xD;
      technologies will involve magnetic resonance imaging. Multi-contrast ultra-high resolution MR&#xD;
      imaging (MRI) with serial direct planimetry will be performed in recipients of VCA.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        For the VCA portion of the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients referred due to one or more of these conditions: (1) severe facial deformity&#xD;
             comprising more than 25% of the facial area and/or one or more of the central facial&#xD;
             units (i.e. lip(s), nose, eye(s)), (2) single or bilateral upper limb(s) amputation,&#xD;
             where at least one of the limbs was amputated at the level of the wrist or more&#xD;
             proximal, up to the functional shoulder joint, and (3) severe abdominal wall defect&#xD;
             comprising more than 50% of the functional abdominal wall.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Injuries must have taken place no more than 15 years and no less than 6 months prior&#xD;
             to presentation for consideration.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  All other conventional reconstruction approaches will have been either exhausted, or&#xD;
             ruled out due to poor prognosis of outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients will need to possess strong motivation and a willingness to commit to&#xD;
             post-transplant rehabilitation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Normal renal and hepatic function within acceptable medical parameters&#xD;
&#xD;
        For the recombinant IL-2 phase of the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  At least 3 months have elapsed since the VCA transplant operation&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  At least 4 weeks on stable immune suppression and steriods (&lt;5 mg QD).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  No addition or subtraction of other immunosuppressive medications for 4 weeks prior to&#xD;
             enrollment. The dose of immunosuppressive medicines may be adjusted based on the&#xD;
             therapeutic range for that drug.&#xD;
&#xD;

             have adequate organ function.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The effects of some of the study drugs on the developing human fetus are unknown, or&#xD;
             toxic. For this reason, women of child-bearing potential and men must agree to use&#xD;
             adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence prior&#xD;
             to study entry and for the duration of study participation). Should a women become&#xD;
             pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while participating in this study, she should&#xD;
             inform her treating physician immediately.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects must be able to understand and willing to sign a written informed consent&#xD;
             document.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Skin biopsies from the transplanted parts must show no evidence of rejection for at&#xD;
             least 3 months prior to study enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        For the VCA portion of the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of poor compliance with prostheses or rehabilitation&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Impaired renal, cardiac and/or pulmonary function&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Compromised ability to understand the risk and benefits of participation in the study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Active malignancy&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Single non-dominant upper limb amputation and no other vascularized composite tissue&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Active infection&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Non-healing wounds&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnancy, because of the potential for teratoenic or abortifacient effects. There is&#xD;
             an unknown but potential risk of adverse events in nursing infants secondary to&#xD;
             treatment of the mother, therefore breastfeeding should be discontinued.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Rejection episodes within the past 3 months&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Active malignant relapse&#xD;
