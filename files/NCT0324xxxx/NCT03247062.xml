      Summary of the project :&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lack or disturbances of sleep are major problems in patients staying in intensive care unit&#xD;
      (ICU) due to the particular environment. The noises, lack of circadian rhythm of light lead&#xD;
      to progressive deafferentation. The patients are then at risk of immune deficiencies,&#xD;
      agitation and confusion states, cognitive troubles that may be associated to increased&#xD;
      morbidity and mortality in the short and long term. Thus, improvement of the sleep of the ICU&#xD;
      patients may impact non only during the ICU stay but also on their future quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sleep bundle project is a quality improvement project with a before-after design,&#xD;
      consisting in the evaluation of a bundle of measures that may increase the quality and&#xD;
      duration of sleep in ICU patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The bundle consists in the proposition of eye-mask, ear-plugs, music and/or massage to the&#xD;
      patients in parallele to structural and organizational modifications of the service such as&#xD;
      the decrease of the alarms sounds, changing the luminosity between day and night, etc.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The principal indicators followed will be:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The sleep quality of the patients&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The continuous noise intensity in the rooms&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The continuous light intensity in the rooms Baseline - before period: 8 weeks&#xD;
           Implementation of the bundle with training of the team: 4 weeks After period: 8 weeks.&#xD;

      Sleep bundle_detailed project _ English&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients of intensive care unit (ICU) suffer from sleep disorders or lack of sleep due to&#xD;
      the particular environment. Among other problems, the noise, the lack of circadian variation&#xD;
      of the light lead to a progressive temporal and spatial disorientation. The patients then are&#xD;
      subject to a modification of their immunity, present agitation and confusion, neurocognitive&#xD;
      disorders with consequences on the morbidity and the short and long-term mortality. An&#xD;
      improvement of the sleep of the patients staying in the intensive care will have potentially&#xD;
      an impact not only during the stay in the service but also for their future quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The project &quot; sleep bundle &quot; aims at improving the sleep of the patients by the&#xD;
      implementation of a multimodal intervention that consists in a set of measures (or bundle) at&#xD;
      different levels: on a structural level in the service), organizational and individual care&#xD;
      of the patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intervention, called &quot;sleep bundle&quot; will be proposed to each ICU patient at the bedtime:&#xD;
      ear plugs, a mask for eyes, the listening of a soft music, a massage. The whole service&#xD;
      structure and organization will be modified by: the installation of a bright light in the&#xD;
      daytime and avoidance of light or dark at night, education of the medical and nurse staff in&#xD;
      order to increase the awareness of the paitents needs (i.e. limit the light during the night&#xD;
      by the use of a shadowless illumination during the night care), a protocol to adapt the&#xD;
      volume of the alarms, the implementation of trash cans with shock absorber of lid in every&#xD;
      cubicle, the presence of viewable clocks by all the patients (temporal orientation),&#xD;
      recalling the necessity of giving to the patients their glasses and hearing aids during&#xD;
      daytime.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design of the project and methodology: this project is a Quality improvement project with the&#xD;
      classical BEFORE and AFTER approach. It will measure some quantitative measures and&#xD;
      indicators before and after the implementation of the intervention, i.e. the sleep bundle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Determine if the sleep of the patients can be improved by the use of one &quot;sleep bundle&quot;. The&#xD;
      subjective evaluation of the quality of the sleep by the patients will be realized with the&#xD;
      &quot;Richard Campbell Sleep Questionnaire (RCSQ)&quot;, the analog visual scale, translated into&#xD;
      French version, completed by the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective evaluation of the depth of the sleep will be realized with the BIS (Index&#xD;
      Bispectral), in randomly selected patients according to a table of randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine the impact of the implementation of the &quot; sleep bundle &quot; on agitation, delirium,&#xD;
      the number of incidents (involuntary removal of naso-gastric tubes, venous lines,&#xD;
      endotracheal tubes, etc). The evaluation of the states of agitation and delirium of the&#xD;
      patients will be realized via the scores SAS and CAM-ICU.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following data will be collected in the medical file of patients (SISIF ®):&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Age of the patients, gender, length of ICU stay, history of psychiatric disorders, any&#xD;
           dependency (alcohol, benzodiazépines, neuroleptics, tobacco, heroin, methadone, etc).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pain scores ( EVA and CPOT), quantity of administered by painkillers, psychotrops,&#xD;
           opiates&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Frequency of the care of nursing&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Admission in the room(chamber) during night&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Incidents : involuntary removal of catheters, endotracheal tubes, fall, violence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following data will be measured in the environment:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Luminosity of the cubicle(dock,garage), (the before / later) with a luxmeter&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Monitoring of the noise in the rooms &quot; Soundear Draeger&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The population will consist in:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Adults (≥18 years),&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Hospitalized of more than 24 hours in the ICU&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Predictable stay of at least another day&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  As soon as the patients is awake, with or without endotracheal tube&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Glasgow ≥12, SAS = 3-4, negative CAM-ICU&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusions criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with neurological impairment after medical or surgical insult who require&#xD;
      neurological surveillance of more than every 4 hours will not benefit from the sleep bundle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sample size was calculated from the average score of RCSQ 49±23 m±DS observed of on 9&#xD;
      experimental patients. We seek to achieve a RCSQ score of ≥65 (with the same DS) in 90 %. 44&#xD;
      patients for the period BEFORE and 44 LATER will be needed. The data of the patients will be&#xD;
      collected in a anonymous way.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Every patient holding(retaining) the criteria of inclusion will be included in the project.&#xD;
      The estimation practised for the last months before the study period shows that the number of&#xD;
      liable patients to be included varies between 5 and 15 patients / week according to the&#xD;
      occupation rate of the service.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The duration of 3 periods of the project is going to vary according to the number of&#xD;
      patients. By taking into account variations of occupation rate and the possible &quot; drop backs&#xD;
      out &quot; according to the clinical evolution of the patient, we plan the next periods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      50 patients during the BEFORE period - duration 8 weeks , 30 patients during the&#xD;
      implementation of the bundle-duration 4 weeks, 50 patients AFTER the implementation -&#xD;
      duration 8 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Total duration of the project: 20 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This project will be sustained in the service thereafter, with a continuous monitoring of the&#xD;
      sleep quality of ICU patients (RCSQ ) and some indicators.&#xD;
