    <textblock>
      Inflammatory cytokines play a pivotal role in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and innovative&#xD;
      non-pharmacological therapies aimed at limiting cytokine production are highly warranted.&#xD;
      Recently, our group showed that healthy volunteers trained in an intervention developed by&#xD;
      'Iceman' Wim Hof were able to voluntarily attenuate the pro-inflammatory response during&#xD;
      experimental human endotoxemia (a model of systemic inflammation elicited by administration&#xD;
      of lipopolysaccharide [LPS] in healthy volunteers). Subjects trained in the intervention&#xD;
      exhibited profound increases in plasma adrenaline levels, a rapid increase of an&#xD;
      anti-inflammatory cytokine and subsequent attenuation of the pro-inflammatory response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intervention consists of three elements, namely meditation, exposure to cold and&#xD;
      breathing techniques. The meditation element is not likely to be involved. It was a very&#xD;
      minor part of the training program and was not practiced during the endotoxemia experiments.&#xD;
      Exposure to cold and the subsequent rewarming to normal body temperature may influence the&#xD;
      inflammatory response through the release of immunomodulatory molecules like HSP-70. Also,&#xD;
      exposure to cold can induce an ischemia-reperfusion-like state in the skin and peripheral&#xD;
      tissue that is known to be involved in the downregulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines and&#xD;
      upregulation of anti-inflammatory cytokines. The investigators anticipate that the third&#xD;
      element, breathing techniques, is the major contributor to the anti-inflammatory effects of&#xD;
      the intervention previously observed. The present study aims to explore the effects of the&#xD;
      breathing technique ('strength ventilation'), the exposure to cold, and these two elements&#xD;
      combined on the immune response during human endotoxemia. Elucidation of the relative&#xD;
      contribution of the elements is of importance to establish a feasible, safe, and effective&#xD;
      intervention for future use in patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: The primary objective of the present study is to determine the effects of the&#xD;
      'strength ventilation' breathing technique and exposure to cold, both separately and in&#xD;
      combination, on the inflammatory response during human endotoxemia. To this end, a 2 by 2&#xD;
      design will be employed. Additionally, an evaluation of the influence of the cold exposure&#xD;
      and breathing technique on pain thresholds and oxygen tension in the mitochondria will take&#xD;
      place.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Auto-immune diseases are characterized by an inappropriate inflammatory response against&#xD;
      tissues in the body. These diseases, of which rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is the most&#xD;
      well-known, represent a major health care burden. Pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-α,&#xD;
      IL-6 and IL-1β are central in the pathogenesis of RA and many other auto-immune diseases.&#xD;
      Biologics that antagonize inflammatory cytokines or their receptors, e.g. anti-TNF-α, soluble&#xD;
      TNF-α-receptor, anti-IL-6 receptor, and IL-1 receptor antagonist, are very effective&#xD;
      treatments. However, they are very expensive and can have serious side effects. Furthermore,&#xD;
      the consequences of RA are currently completely beyond the patients' sphere of influence.&#xD;
      Therefore, innovative therapies aimed at limiting inflammation in RA patients are warranted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently, a study into the effects of an intervention developed by 'The Iceman' Wim Hof&#xD;
      revealed that it is possible to voluntarily attenuate the pro-inflammatory response during&#xD;
      experimental human endotoxemia (a standardized, controlled, and reproducible model of&#xD;
      systemic inflammation elicited by administration of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in healthy&#xD;
      volunteers). The intervention developed by Hof consists of several elements, namely&#xD;
      meditation, exposure to cold and breathing techniques. Subjects trained in this intervention&#xD;
      exhibited profound increases in plasma adrenaline levels, a rapid increase of the&#xD;
      anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10, and subsequent attenuation of the pro-inflammatory response&#xD;
      (e.g. plasma levels of TNF-α, IL-6, and IL-8) during experimental human endotoxemia. This&#xD;
      intervention could therefore represent a treatment modality that would empower RA patients to&#xD;
      exert self-control over their disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on these data, investigating the effectiveness of the intervention in RA patients is&#xD;
      highly warranted. The study described in this protocol is part of a larger project in which&#xD;
      the investigators ultimately strive to translate the intervention to clinical practice for RA&#xD;
      patients. However, there are important issues that need to be addressed first. For example,&#xD;
      feasibility and safety would be substantially improved if patients would only have to learn&#xD;
      or practice one of the three elements of the intervention. The meditation element is not&#xD;
      likely to be involved. It was a very minor part of the training program and was not practiced&#xD;
      during the endotoxemia experiments. Also, there is no objective manner to measure this&#xD;
      element and there is no hypothesis for a possible mechanism. Concerning the second element,&#xD;
      exposure to cold, it would especially be of value to determine whether this element has&#xD;
      additional value, because it is very demanding and might not be suitable for RA patients at&#xD;
      all. The investigators anticipate that the third element, breathing techniques, is the major&#xD;
      contributor to the anti-inflammatory effects of the intervention previously observed for&#xD;
      reasons outlined below.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Breathing techniques First, although the healthy volunteers were trained in all three&#xD;
      elements, subjects only practiced breathing techniques during the endotoxemia experiment.&#xD;
      Second, the breathing techniques were characterized by cyclic hyperventilation, which has&#xD;
      been shown before to result in increased adrenaline levels. Subjects practiced two types of&#xD;
      breathing techniques during the endotoxemia experiment in our previous endotoxemia study.&#xD;
      Both of these breathing techniques were characterized by cycles of hyperventilation. In one&#xD;
      of the techniques (hyper/hypoventilation), subjects held their breath for up to several&#xD;
      minutes after each hyperventilation period, while in the other technique (strength&#xD;
      ventilation), subjects held their breath for only 10 seconds during which all muscles were&#xD;
      tightened after each hyperventilation period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Yet unpublished data (CMO 2014-1374) showed the effects of these two breathing techniques in&#xD;
      the absence of cold exposure (or meditation) on plasma adrenaline levels. The investigators&#xD;
      found these to be strongly correlated with the anti-inflammatory effects previously found.&#xD;
      Both breathing techniques resulted in comparable increases in plasma adrenaline levels.&#xD;
      Furthermore, adrenaline levels in subjects trained by Hof were comparable to those that were&#xD;
      trained by an independent trainer previously not familiar with the intervention developed by&#xD;
      Hof. Finally, adrenaline levels in subjects trained for 4 days were similar to those who were&#xD;
      trained for only 2 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on these results, it is hypothesized that the strength ventilation technique is the&#xD;
      major contributor to the anti-inflammatory effects of the intervention previously observed.&#xD;
      However, the effects of solely this breathing technique on the inflammatory response is not&#xD;
      investigated yet. Furthermore, it cannot be ruled out that the exposure to cold has&#xD;
      additional effects, since there are several ways in which exposure to cold could contribute&#xD;
      to anti-inflammatory effects, as described below.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exposure to cold First, exposure to cold and the subsequent rewarming to normal body&#xD;
      temperature may influence the inflammatory response through the release of immunomodulatory&#xD;
      danger associated molecular patterns (DAMP's), more specifically TLR-4 ligands such as heat&#xD;
      shock protein 70 (HSP-70). It was shown that HSP-70 mRNA levels in isolated cardiac myocytes&#xD;
      increased during rewarming after 2.5 hours of hypothermia. Furthermore, pre-incubation of&#xD;
      human cells exposed to 4 °C for 1, 2, 3 and 4 hours induced synthesis and accumulation of&#xD;
      HSP-70 upon recovery to 37 °C. The relevance of HSP-70 for the inflammatory response is&#xD;
      evident from a study in which HSP-70 was shown to induce potent anti-inflammatory effects&#xD;
      resembling induction of endotoxin tolerance in human monocytes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Second, exposure to cold can induce an ischemia-reperfusion-like state in the skin and&#xD;
      peripheral tissue. A study into the effects of cryotherapy showed that local cooling of the&#xD;
      skin decreases local tissue perfusion. The combination of tissue hypoperfusion and&#xD;
      reperfusion upon the reactive vasodilatation that follows after rewarming is a form of&#xD;
      ischemia/reperfusion (I/R). The potency of I/R to protect tissue against ischemic damage is&#xD;
      known as Ischemic Preconditioning (IPC). It has the potential to influence the immune&#xD;
      response through several pathways. For instance, recent animal work has shown that I/R&#xD;
      results in downregulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-α and IL-6 and&#xD;
      upregulation of anti-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-10. Furthermore, hypoxia-inducible&#xD;
      factor (HIF) has been shown to be a major contributor to the I/R-induced IL-10 response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Third, exposure to cold could have a potentiating effect on the adrenaline release evoked by&#xD;
      the breathing techniques. In a study of human volunteers, adrenaline levels were increased&#xD;
      after 2 hours of sitting in a cold room. Interestingly, in a study during acute exercise in&#xD;
      human volunteers, cold exposure prior to exercise was associated with an added&#xD;
      immuno-stimulatory effect. Also, cytokineresponse of IL-1beta and IL-6 in ex vivo&#xD;
      LPS-stimulated blood was lower in experienced ice-swimmers compared to inexperienced&#xD;
      ice-swimmers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Taken together, cold exposure may influence the in vivo response to endotoxemia. This might&#xD;
      be mediated by direct, adrenaline-independent effects or by enhancing adrenaline levels&#xD;
      elicited by strength ventilation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Synthesis This study aims to explore the effects of two elements of the intervention&#xD;
      initially developed by Hof, namely the strength ventilation breathing technique and the&#xD;
      exposure to cold, on the immune response during human endotoxemia. Effects of both elements&#xD;
      separately as well as in combination will be tested, the latter to explore the interplay&#xD;
      between the elements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, an assesment will be made of the effects of the (combination of) breathing&#xD;
      techniques and cold exposure on pain perception. In previous studies, trained subjects&#xD;
      experienced substantially less flu-like symptoms during endotoxemia. This could be due to the&#xD;
      attenuated immune response in these subjects, but also through other effects induced by the&#xD;
      breathing techniques and/or cold exposure. To investigate this, quantitative sensory testing&#xD;
      (QST) is used, an objective technique to measure pain thresholds.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Finally, non invasive measurements of oxygen tension in the mitochondria will be used to&#xD;
      asses mitochondrial function during human endotoxemia by using the Protoporphyrin IX-Triplet&#xD;
      State Liftime Technique (PpIX-TSLT).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mitochondrial dysfunction is an important element in the pathophysiology of sepsis. However,&#xD;
      a valid non-invasive method to measure mitochondrial function is not yet available. In animal&#xD;
      models, the PpIX-TSLT technique has shown to be a feasible technique to measure alterations&#xD;
      in mitochondrial oxygen tension during endotoxemia. This has never been studied in humans&#xD;
      during endotoxemia. Furthermore, the exposure to cold and especially the breathing technique&#xD;
      may influence oxygen tension in the mitochondria as well, as blood gas parameters (e.g. pCO2,&#xD;
      acid base balance etc.) fluctuate to a large extent during the practicing of this technique.&#xD;
