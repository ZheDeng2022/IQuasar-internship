  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic Traumatic Brain Injury (cTBI) symptoms exist in individuals who experienced previous&#xD;
      traumatic brain injuries. There are 80-90 thousand individuals who are clinically diagnosed&#xD;
      with cTBI, with estimated costs at greater than 60 billion dollars. However, there is a lack&#xD;
      of studies using comprehensive diagnostic imaging tools to better understand physiological&#xD;
      ramifications of the injury that may help guide therapy.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this project will be to create a comprehensive, extensive, longitudinal&#xD;
      diagnostic evaluation of cTBI patients. The evaluation uses a battery of neurocognitive&#xD;
      tests, laboratory levels of specific inflammatory compounds, and functional MRI, PET, and&#xD;
      quantitative EEG. Participants shall be evaluated with this overall test battery initially,&#xD;
      and then at approximately 3 and 6 months to determine the time course of changes within the&#xD;
      brain associated with an integrative medicine approach. Three groups of participants will be&#xD;
      enrolled in the study: anti-inflammatory diet group, a group who receive N-acetyl cysteine,&#xD;
      and control group. NAC, is the N-acetyl derivative of the naturally occurring amino acid,&#xD;
      L-cysteine. It is a common over-the-counter supplement that is also available as an&#xD;
      injectable pharmaceutical that protects the liver in cases of acetaminophen overdose.&#xD;
      Laboratory studies have displayed some benefits to use of NAC. It has the potential to reduce&#xD;
      markers of oxidative damage, protect against cell death, and to increase glutathione in&#xD;
      blood, which might be useful in preventing oxidative damage in TBI patients.&#xD;

    <description>N-acetyl Cysteine: This arm provide patients with a natural supplement, n-acetyl cysteine (NAC) which is the N-acetyl derivative of the naturally occurring amino acid, L-cysteine, that supports antioxidants to reduce oxidative damage in the body. NAC is a common over-the-counter supplement. It is used as an injectable pharmaceutical to protect the liver in cases of acetaminophen overdose. Laboratory studies have suggested that NAC might have a beneficial effect in neurodegenerative disorders such as TBI. Patients in this arm will receive IV NAC once a week plus oral NAC supplement 500 mg twice per day for approximately 3 months until the follow up evaluation.</description>
