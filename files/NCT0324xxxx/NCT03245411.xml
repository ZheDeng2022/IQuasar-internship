  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Einstein Medical Center in Philadelphia serves a diverse group of the patient population. The&#xD;
      majority of patients have a diverse cultural background, low literacy, and poor&#xD;
      social-economic status. Medication adherence for chronic medical problems is in a range of&#xD;
      40-70%. Medication adherence among patients on oral anti-cancer therapy is not studied in&#xD;
      detail. The main objective is to study medication adherence to oral anticancer agents in&#xD;
      patients with low literacy and poor socio-economic status.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Until recently, contemporary approaches to cancer care have failed to consistently tailor&#xD;
      communication approaches to patients with low health literacy. They have produced mixed&#xD;
      results in regard to implementation of successful interventions in addressing the needs of&#xD;
      this populations. Low health literacy is especially common in medically underserved&#xD;
      communities, including in North Philadelphia. Cancer treatment, including cancer&#xD;
      chemotherapy, is complex, and it requires substantial skills, in order for patients to adhere&#xD;
      to care and achieve the goals of therapy. Patients with low health literacy find it&#xD;
      especially challenging to navigate cancer treatment. Results of previous research showed that&#xD;
      intervention strategies that address the needs for information and material support of&#xD;
      African American older adults, can help improve adherence to cancer screening in this&#xD;
      population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose is to develop and evaluate model interventions to improve healthcare outcomes for&#xD;
      socially disadvantaged populations. The objective in this proposal is to conduct a randomized&#xD;
      controlled trial that evaluates the effects of an intervention that provides enhanced&#xD;
      education and material support, on adherence to care, among the cancer patients of the&#xD;
      Medical Oncology Clinic of the Einstein Medical Center in Philadelphia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The central hypothesis is that compared to the standard educational intervention delivered by&#xD;
      a registered nurse, the addition of an enhanced intervention (enhanced education,&#xD;
      problem-solving skills and facilitative support) will result in greater adherence care,&#xD;
      especially among patients with low health literacy.&#xD;

    <description>In addition to the standard of care, the participants randomized to Intervention Group will be invited to a separate room. The following activities will be undertaken, in order to address patients' questions and concerns, and discuss potential solutions to their barriers to care&#xD;
The patient will be asked to watch brief educational videos on &quot;Life with oral cancer treatment.&quot; The information contained in the videos will be reinforced with materials written at a 4th grade level, that correspond to each of the brief videos.The patient will receive a brief phone call (from the study coordinator) on the first business day following the baseline interview, and thereafter, two weeks following each visit to the oncology clinic.</description>
