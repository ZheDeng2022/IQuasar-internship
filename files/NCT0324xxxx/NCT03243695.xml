  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      patients with fractured teeth in the esthetic area requiring immediate restoration will be&#xD;
      recruited to the study. Immediate implants will be placed and patients will be restored&#xD;
      either with straight or angled abutments. Implant failure will be measured.&#xD;

      A: General operative procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be explained in details to the eligible participants with all possible&#xD;
      alternative treatment options and possible risk.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If a patient accepts the treatment, informed consent will be signed. Standard extra oral and&#xD;
      intraoral examination will be carried out. Diagnostic charts will be filled including medical&#xD;
      and past dental history.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patient will choose a sealed envelope to determine the allocation group. Preliminary&#xD;
      impressions will be taken. The tooth to be extracted will be trimmed from the cast and an&#xD;
      ideal wax up will be done.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A hard vacuum stent 2 mm thickness will be constructed over the cast with the wax up for&#xD;
      fabrication of the temporary crown later.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patient will be imaged a cone beam computerized topography (CBCT). The acquired DICOM&#xD;
      image will be assessed on blue sky software ®. All the cases must have adequate buccolingual&#xD;
      bone, if not the patient will be excluded from the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The co-supervisor (MW) will inform the principle investigator (HF) with the allocation group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The principle investigator (HF) will plan the case. The implants will be planned apical to&#xD;
      socket depth to engage apical bone for better primary stability. Final implant position 3&#xD;
      dimensionally will be according to allocation group to allow for placement of either straight&#xD;
      or angled abutment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The guide will be exported from the software and printed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intra operative procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will administrate a prophylactic antibiotic 3 days ahead the surgery. The procedure&#xD;
      will be carried out under local anesthesia under sterile conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The remaining tooth will be extracted atraumatically using periotome for better bone&#xD;
      preservation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After tooth extraction, the socket will be curettaged and irrigated with copious saline till&#xD;
      fresh bleeding from the socket is observed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Surgical guide will be placed and checked for stability and drilling will be performed&#xD;
      following instructions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before implant insertion, the prepared osteotomy will be lavaged thoroughly to remove any&#xD;
      drill debris from the socket.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The implant will be placed and the insertion torque will be checked using manual torque&#xD;
      wrench. Implants with insertion torque less than 35Ncm will not be loaded and will be&#xD;
      excluded from the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Periapical radiographs will be taken to ensure proper seating of the implant. The abutment,&#xD;
      whether straight or angled according to the allocation group, will be attached to the implant&#xD;
      fixture.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The vacuum stent will be used to perform the temporary crown using autopolymerizing resin.&#xD;
      The crown will be checked to be out of occlusion in centric and eccentric occlusion to avoid&#xD;
      any premature contact and subsequent overloading. Then the crown will be cemented and excess&#xD;
      cement will be removed using dental floss.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patient will be called for follow up after 1 week for the first 3 weeks then at 1 month&#xD;
      and 3 months.&#xD;
