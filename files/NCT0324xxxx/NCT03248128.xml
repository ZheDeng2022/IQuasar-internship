  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of asthma treatment is to achieve and maintain asthma control and to reduce the&#xD;
      future risk of exacerbations. Inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) are considered as the most&#xD;
      effective anti- inflammatory treatment for all severities of persistent asthma. For children&#xD;
      &gt;=5 years of age and adolescents whose asthma is uncontrolled, low-dose ICS plus adjunctive&#xD;
      therapy with long-acting beta agonist (LABA) is considered as effective. Thus, this study is&#xD;
      designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of FF (ICS component)/VI (LABA component)&#xD;
      compared to FF alone for the treatment of asthma, in subjects aged 5 to 17 years old&#xD;
      currently uncontrolled on ICS. The study will be conducted over a total duration of&#xD;
      approximately 29 weeks: 4 week run-in period, 24-week double-blind treatment period and&#xD;
      1-week follow-up period. Subjects will be randomized to receive FDC of FF/VI or FF&#xD;
      administered via ELLIPTA® dry powder inhaler (DPI). The dose of both FF/VI and FF alone will&#xD;
      be selected based on the age of subjects. Subjects will receive a short acting beta 2 agonist&#xD;
      (SABA) (albuterol /salbutamol) as a rescue medication throughout the study. A total of 870&#xD;
      subjects will be randomized in the study. Of this, 652 subjects will be aged 5 to 11 years&#xD;
      (cohort A), and 218 will be aged 12 to 17 years inclusive (cohort B). ELLIPTA is a registered&#xD;
      trademark of GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) group of companies.&#xD;

    <description>PEF is defined as the maximum speed of expiration of a person. PEF will be measured using a hand-held electronic peak flow meter each morning prior to the dose of study medication and any rescue albuterol/salbutamol inhalation aerosol use. The best of three measurements will be recorded in the daily diary.</description>

    <measure>Cohort A and B: Change from Baseline in asthma control questionnaire (ACQ-5) at Week 24</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and at Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>The ACQ-5 is a five-item questionnaire, which includes five questions (concerning nocturnal awakening, waking in the morning, activity limitation, shortness of breath and wheeze). The questions will enquire about the frequency and/or severity of symptoms over the previous week and will be self-completed by the subjects. The response options for all these questions will consist of a scale ranging from 0 (no impairment/limitation) to 6 (total impairment/ limitation). A score of &lt;0.75 indicates well-controlled asthma and a score &gt;=1.5 indicates poorly controlled asthma. A change of &gt;=0.5 in score suggests a clinically important change in score.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Cohort A and B: Number of subjects with incidence of exacerbations over the 24-Week treatment period</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>An exacerbation is defined as deterioration of asthma requiring the use of systemic corticosteroids (tablets, suspension, or injection) for at least 3 days or a single depot corticosteroid injection or an in-patient hospitalization or emergency department visit due to asthma that required systemic corticosteroids. Information regarding asthma exacerbations will be collected and recorded over the specified period.</description>

    <measure>Cohort A and B: Number of subjects with adverse events (AEs), serious adverse events (SAEs)</measure>

    <description>An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a subject, temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product. Any untoward event resulting in death, life threatening, requires hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, results in disability/incapacity, congenital anomaly/birth defect or any other situation according to medical or scientific judgment will be categorized as SAE.</description>
