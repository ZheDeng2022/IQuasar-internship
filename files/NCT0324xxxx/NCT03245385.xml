      This is an open-label, safety study designed to assess the multiple-dose pharmacokinetics and&#xD;
      potential for adrenal suppression following topical treatment with halobetasol propionate&#xD;
      0.05% spray applied twice-daily in adult patients with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis.&#xD;
      At least 40 eligible patients with atopic dermatitis that satisfy all eligibility criteria&#xD;
      will be enrolled into the study. Patients must be overall in good health and should have a&#xD;
      current diagnosis of moderate to severe atopic dermatitis with Investigator Global Assessment&#xD;
      (IGA) score of at least 3 or 4. Patients will be stratified by age with:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cohort 1: At least 20 patients 18 years of age and older with ≥ 25% BSA affected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cohort 2: At least 20 patients 12-16 years and 11 months of age with ≥ 25% BSA affected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cohort 2 will initiate enrollment once all enrolled patients in Cohort 1 have completed the&#xD;
      study and a safety analysis has been reviewed by the Medical Monitor and approved by the&#xD;
      Novum Independent Institutional Review Board (NIIRB). Sites will not begin enrollment of&#xD;
      patients in Cohort 2 until the site is notified by email that the safety analysis for Cohort&#xD;
      1 has been reviewed and approved. Each cohort will be enrolled based on the availability of&#xD;
      patients. Each cohort will be reviewed for the potential of HPA axis suppression. The Medical&#xD;
      Monitor or NIIRB may discontinue the study at any time if safety concerns are found. If 6 or&#xD;
      more patients in Cohort 1 experience HPA axis suppression, then enrollment for Cohort 1 will&#xD;
      be stopped. Cohort 2 will not be initiated if 6 or more patients enrolled in Cohort 1&#xD;
      experience HPA axis suppression or 30% or more of the final enrolled number of patients in&#xD;
      Cohort 1 experience HPA axis suppression. If 6 or more patients in Cohort 2 experience HPA&#xD;
      axis suppression, then enrollment for Cohort 2 will be stopped. If the study is stopped at&#xD;
      any time, patients currently enrolled will be contacted via phone and instructed to&#xD;
      discontinue study product immediately. Patients will be instructed to return for their next&#xD;
      scheduled visit for cortisol response testing. Sites will follow up with patients and monitor&#xD;
      for HPA axis suppression. All patients will be followed until cortisol levels are normal, as&#xD;
      defined in study protocol. Patients enrolled in the study will apply the study product twice&#xD;
      daily onto the affected skin areas for 14 days (Days 1-14), according to provided&#xD;
      instructions. .Patients will be instructed not to rub over the affected area after&#xD;
      application of spray. Each patient is expected to receive 28 doses of study product. All&#xD;
      patients will attend the clinic for the following 8 scheduled visits. Patients will apply the&#xD;
      morning dose of the study product in the clinic at each clinic visit (and evening dose on Day&#xD;
      4) and at home during non-clinic visits. A phone call will be made approximately 14 days&#xD;
      after the patient has completed dosing to follow-up on any new adverse events that may have&#xD;
      occurred. All patients will have a cortisol response test performed at screening and on Day&#xD;
      17 (at least 48 hours after last dose of study product).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The safety profile of the test product will be evaluated by analysis of reported adverse&#xD;
      events.&#xD;
