  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with relapsed or refractory leukemia often develop resistance to chemotherapy and&#xD;
      some patients who relapse following CD19 directed therapy relapse with CD19 negative&#xD;
      leukemia. For this reason, the investigators are attempting to use T-cells obtained directly&#xD;
      from the patient, which can be genetically modified to express a chimeric antigen receptor&#xD;
      (CAR) to CD22, a different protein from CD19, expressed on the surface of the leukemic cell&#xD;
      in patients with CD22+ leukemia. The CAR enables the T-cell to recognize and kill the&#xD;
      leukemic cell through the recognition of CD22, a protein expressed on the surface of the&#xD;
      leukemic cell in patients with CD22+ leukemia. This is a Phase 1 study designed to determine&#xD;
      the safety and feasibility of the CAR+ T - cells and the feasibility of making enough to&#xD;
      treat patients with CD22+ leukemia.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  First 3 subjects: male and female subjects age ≥ 18 years and &lt; 27 years&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subsequent subjects: 12 months of age and &lt;27 years of age at the time of study&#xD;
             enrollment&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Disease status (one of the following):&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. If post-allogeneic hematopoetic cell transplant (HCT): confirmed CD22+ leukemia&#xD;

&#xD;
               2. If Relapse/Refractory status with no prior history of allogeneic HCT, one of:&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  2nd or grater marrow relapse, with or without extramedullary disease&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  1st marrow relapse at end of 1st month of re-induction with marrow having&#xD;
