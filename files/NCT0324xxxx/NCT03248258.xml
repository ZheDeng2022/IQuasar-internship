    <textblock>
      Develop a Metastatic Breast Cancer (MBC)-specific electronic Treatment Plans (TP).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1a: Patient interviews along with navigator, nurse, and physician focus group discussions&#xD;
      will be used to identify factors that influence decision-making in treatment selection and&#xD;
      the optimal approach for sharing information about prognosis and guideline-based care.&#xD;
      Identify decisional needs for Shared Decision Making (SDM) in MBC. Investigators will conduct&#xD;
      semi-structured interviews/discussion groups with patients, navigators, nurses, and&#xD;
      physicians to elements important to decision-making.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1b: Develop MBC-specific TP. Investigators will build upon Aim1a to systematically&#xD;
      develop the TP intervention using the Ottawa Decision Support Framework. Investigators will&#xD;
      test the TPs with 5 patients and conduct qualitative investigations to refine the TP using an&#xD;
      iterative process.&#xD;

      Investigators will use patient interviews and navigator, nurse, and physician focus group&#xD;
      discussions to identify factors that influence decision-making in treatment selection and the&#xD;
      optimal approach for sharing information about prognosis and guideline-based care. Patients&#xD;
      will be recruited from the medical oncology clinic. Patients will be identified by their&#xD;
      primary oncologist. All eligible patient will be provided with a study information flyer. All&#xD;
      patient participants will be asked to provide written informed consent prior to participation&#xD;
      in interviews; provider participants will be provided with Information sheets prior to focus&#xD;
      groups by a research coordinator. Participants in Group 1 will be asked to complete a&#xD;
      demographic form. The demographic forms for patients, navigators, nurses, and medical&#xD;
      oncologists are included in Appendix B. Demographic form will include questions about your&#xD;
      age, sex, race and education. The demographic form will take 5 minutes to complete. At study&#xD;
      entry, descriptive data including patient demographics (age, sex, race), breast cancer&#xD;
      characteristics (subtype, line of therapy, specific treatment offered, prior treatments&#xD;
      received), physician will be collected to provide clinical context for the analysis. The&#xD;
      patients will be interviewed at the patient's next appointment (either with the physician or&#xD;
      in the infusion center) or the patients can schedule to come on an off clinic day of their&#xD;
      preference. The study coordinators will offer each patient the option to complete the consent&#xD;
      form at home. If they decide to complete the consent form at home investigators will follow&#xD;
      up with by contacting them on the telephone to ensure that the consent form was completed and&#xD;
      to confirm their interview at their next clinic visit or an off day of their preference. This&#xD;
      30 minute to an hour interview will take place in a private meeting room within the UAB&#xD;
      Comprehensive cancer center. The patient interviews will be audio-recorded by using a digital&#xD;
      audio recorder.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For Group 2, patients will be recruited from the medical oncology clinic. Patients will be&#xD;
      identified by their primary oncologist. A trained research coordinator will consent the&#xD;
      patient during a routine clinic visit. This group will consist of 5 new patients who did not&#xD;
      participate in Group 1 patient interviews. Descriptive data including patient name and&#xD;
      medical record number will be collected on a tracking sheet. No other personal identifiable&#xD;
      information will be collected. This 30-minute interview will take place in the clinic room or&#xD;
      a private room within the UAB Comprehensive cancer center (based on patient preference). The&#xD;
      researcher will provide the patient with the iPad for completion of baseline patient-reported&#xD;
      outcome questionnaires using the CareviveÂ® platform for a test patient in a test environment&#xD;
      which will not be linked to the patient's medical record. The intervention questionnaire will&#xD;
      include standard questions used to routine treatment planning at UAB/MCI as well as any&#xD;
      study-specific questions generated from Phase I above. This will allow feedback on the&#xD;
      questionnaire itself. The research coordinator will then provide the patient with an example&#xD;
      TP that includes responses to the questionnaire. The study PI will review the electronic or a&#xD;
      printed version with the patient to get feedback on the acceptability of the TP, content of&#xD;
      the TP, and the best approach to utilizing the TP. This process may be modified based on&#xD;
      results of our qualitative analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators will conduct separate focus groups with each provider group. This will include&#xD;
      7 breast medical oncologists, 10 patient navigators, and 10 nurses (5 clinic nurses who work&#xD;
      directly with the breast oncologists and 5 infusion nurses).&#xD;

    <description>Shared decision making occurs when patients are informed of risks and benefits associated with treatment options and partner with their oncologist to incorporate their personal preferences and values into decision-making. Shared decision making in medicine can improve quality of care and reduce costs. This will be accessed using qualitative interviews and focus groups discussions. This is not a survey based study.</description>

    <description>The purpose of this study is to identify factors that influence decision-making in treatment selection and the optimal approach for sharing information about prognosis and guideline-based care.&#xD;
Secondly, to further understand patient perspective on the concept of de-escalation, in which patients reduce the amount of chemotherapy to avoid side effects and (2) consider how prognosis would impact their decision-making about reducing chemotherapy (as standard or care or within a clinical trial).</description>
